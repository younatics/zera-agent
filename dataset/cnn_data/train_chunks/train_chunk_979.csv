"Britain’s debt mountain has topped £1.387trillion, and is now the equivalent of 90 per cent of the entire economy. The grim milestone was passed at the end of 2012, new figures from the Office for National Statistics revealed today. It lays bare the dire state of the nation’s finances in the wake of the 2007 financial crash, which has seen government debt double in just five years. Gross national debt has risen dramatically since the financial crash in 2007, new figures from the Office for National Statistics show . The shocking figure will be used later this month to compare Britain’s finances to the rest of Europe. The ONS said that in December gross debt, which includes all financial liabilities of both central and local government but does not take account of liquid assets, was £1,387,436,000,000, up seven per cent on a year earlier. By comparison, the entire British economy was valued at £1,541,465,000,000. The dismal state of government borrowing . has already forced Chancellor George Osborne to abandon his target to . see net debt, a different measure, falling as a percentage of the . economy by 2015-16.  But he has refused to budge on his austerity programme. In last month’s Budget, Mr Osborne told MPs his chance of meeting his debt targets had ‘deteriorated’. He added: ‘There are those who would want to cut much more than we are planning to – and chase the debt target. ‘I . said in December that I thought that with the current weak economic . conditions across Europe that would be a mistake. We’ve got a plan to . cut our structural deficit. ‘And our country’s credibility comes from delivering that plan, not altering it with every forecast.’ In a boost for George Osborne, today's figures show how annual government borrowing has fallen markedly since 2009 . Gross . debt had been fairly level in the decade from 1992, when John Major won . the general election. It rose from £238billion in 1992 to £402billion . 10 years later. But under Labour debt levels gradually climbed before the financial crash in 2007 led to an explosion in borrowing. Chancellor George Osborne, pictured yesterday, has been forced to abandon his debt targets as the economy has taken longer than expected to revive . In the last five years gross debt has soared from £577billion in 2006 to £1.387trillion in 2012. It means gross debt is equivalent to 90 per cent of the entire UK economy, well above the 60 per cent threshold set by the European Union. The UK gross debt level is up from 85.5 per cent of GDP at the end of 2011 and just 43.3 per cent in 2006. Chris Leslie, Labour's shadow Treasury minister, said: 'For all David Cameron's false claims to be paying down Britain's debts, the national debt has gone up and up on his watch. 'And far from getting the deficit down, the Office for Budget Responsibility has said it will be the same this year as it was last year and the year before. This can no longer be called a deficit reduction plan. 'This is happening because our economy has flatlined for the last three years and unemployment is high and rising again. We should be acting to get the economy moving, not paying for the mounting costs of this government's total economic failure.' Under rules agreed in the Maastricht Treaty, all European countries must report every year on their finances to ‘avoid excessive budgetary deficits’. Under the rules countries should run a debt to GDP ratio of 60 per cent. In a boost to Mr Osborne, today’s figures show that government borrowing is falling. The gap between government spending and what it raises through taxes peaked at £161billion in 2009, falling to £150 billion in 2010, £119billion in 2011 and £98billion in 2012. It means net borrowing as a percentage of GDP stood at just 6.8 per cent at the end of 2012, its lowest level since 2008 and at similar levels to those seen in the mid-1990s.","Gross debt at the end of 2012 stood at £1.387trillion, up 7% on 2011 .

"Disney conspired with the CIA to buy up cheap land in Florida for Disney World and orchestrate a unique legal situation that makes the theme park above the law, a new book claims. The company took advice from former CIA agents and lawyers to engineer statutory grounds which still allow Disney World avoid taxation and environmental regulation, it is alleged. The special legal situation underpinning the site is not only unconstitutional, it is claimed, but allows the company to avoid any inconvenient decisions democratically taken at the local level. Magic Kingdom: The CIA helped Disney World . acquire a unique legal status which makes it exempt from local . democratic government, a new book sensationally claims . In 2005 the then chief of Florida's Bureau of Fair Rides Inspection summed up the impunity with which Disney World operates when he admitted: 'We don't have the authority to close the park down or close the rides.' The allegations have been made in a new book, Finding Florida: The True History Of The Sunshine State, by investigative journalist Timothy Allman, extracts from which have been published by the Daily Beast. Best known for his work on the CIA's 'secret war' in Laos and interviews with world figures as foreign correspondent for Vanity Fair, Allman has now turned his attention closer to home with this exposé of Florida's murky past. Guests walk by the entrance to Disney's 'Monsters Inc.' show: The company took advice from CIA agents and lawyers to engineer statutory grounds which still allow it avoid taxation and regulation, it is alleged . Impunity: Guests wait in long lines at Disney World's Dumbo ride. In 2005 then chief of Florida's Bureau of Fair Rides Inspection admitted: 'We don't have the authority to close the park down or close the rides' In Finding Florida he claims that Walt Disney conspired with William 'Wild Bill' Donovan - the so-called 'Father of the CIA' - to establish a state-within-a-state where he could 'control the overall development' of Disney World. Donovan, founding partner of New York law firm Donovan, Leisure, Newton & Irvine, whose attorneys included future CIA director William Casey, provided lawyers to help Disney distract attention from its plans, says Allman. These attorneys, it is claimed, provided fake identities for Disney agents, set up a secret communications centre and organised a disinformation campaign to make sure sellers had no idea who was buying their property. In this way, Disney was from the mid-Sixties able to snap up 40 square miles of land in the Sunshine State for a knockdown price of less than $200 an acre. Investigative journalist Timothy Allman's book claims to reveal that Disney World's creators worked with the CIA to circumvent local law. At its opening, Walt Disney, above, boasted in a recording made before he died about creating a new kind of America . Disney and his advisers then sought a way to 'limit the voting power of the private residents' of the area, to control the impact that local democracy might have on the company's plans. They employed a scheme devised by senior CIA operative Paul Helliwell to establish two phantom cities populated by hand-picked Disney loyalists around which Disney World would be based. The cities were based around Bay Lake and Lake Buena Vista, two artificial reservoirs Disney engineers created by obstructing the area's natural water flow. The company could then 'use these fake governments to control land use and make sure the public monies the theme park generated stayed in Disney's private hands,' Allman writes. Teams of Disney lawyers working out of Donovan's New York law firm drafted the legislation to establish the two pseudo-cities, which was passed by the Florida legislature in 1967. Puppet regime: Disney World's Boardwalk Inn on the shores of Lake Buena Vista, one of two artificial reservoirs around which Disney set up phantom cities with local governments the company could control . However, in violation of both the U.S. and Florida Constitutions, the carefully drafted laws specified that any elected office holder must own property within the cities. The law, which states that each candidate for office 'must be the owner, either directly or as a trustee, of real property situated in the City', ensured any local politician would be intimately linked with Disney. On the day of the magic kingdom's inauguration, Walt Disney, speaking from beyond the grave in a recorded presentation, boasted of creating a new kind of America. 'Of course he was right about creating a new kind of America,' Allman writes. 'By turning the State of Florida and its statutes into their enablers, Disney and his successors pioneered a business model based on public subsidy of private profit coupled with corporate immunity from the laws, regulations, and taxes imposed on actual people that now increasingly characterises the economy of the United States.'","Disney World's special legal arrangements help it avoid tax and regulation, new book claims .
The laws which underpin the two phantom cities it sits on require office holders to own property there .
That defies provisions in the U.S. and Florida constitutions against such laws .

"Richard Griffiths has died at the age of 65, it was announced today. The famed theatrical, television and film actor died yesterday after suffering complications related to heart surgery at the University Hospital of Coventry and Warwickshire. He starred in Alan Bennett's play The History Boys and appeared in cult classic Withnail and I as the comic Uncle Monty, after getting his start with a small role in Richard Attenborough's Gandhi - but he found a new audience of fans as Vernon Dursley in the Harry Potter films. Daniel Radcliffe, who played the title role in Harry Potter and also performed with Griffiths in the play Equus, led tributes to the actor, as Withnail star Richard E. Grant said: 'Chin chin dear friend.' Scroll down for video . Cult hero: Richard Griffiths, who died yesterday at the age of 65, as Uncle Monty alongside Richard E. Grant in 1987 classic Withnail and I . Star: Griffiths at the 2008 Tony awards in New York with Harry Potter star Daniel Radcliffe, with whom he appeared in the blockbuster series and who led tributes to him today . Operation: The 65-year-old actor, pictured left last year in the most recent known picture of him and right in 2006, died following heart surgery . Co-stars: The actor with Stephen Campbell Moore in the 2006 film version of The History Boys, in which he played the inspirational but paedophilic teacher Mr Hector . 'Richard was by my side during two of the most important moments of my career,' he said. 'In August 2000, before official . production had even begun on Potter, we filmed a shot outside the . Dursleys', which was my first ever shot as Harry. I was nervous and he . made me feel at ease. 'Seven years later, we embarked on . Equus together. It was my first time doing a play but, terrified as I . was, his encouragement, tutelage and humour made it a joy. 'In fact, any room he walked into was . made twice as funny and twice as clever just by his presence. I am . proud to say I knew him.' Richard E. Grant tweeted: 'My beloved ""Uncle Monty"" Richard Griffiths died last night. Chin-Chin my dear friend.' Withnail co-star Paul McGann added his condolences, writing: 'A mighty tree has fallen. Heart goes out to his family and loved ones. 'A brilliant, funny, principled man, and a true gent. Led the way on . Withnail and I. Wore his great skill lightly and his great heart out.' Honour: The actor being invested with the OBE for services to drama by the Queen in June 2008 . Beloved: Griffiths played the lead role of Harry Crabbe in popular BBC1 series Pie in the Sky . Many of Griffiths' fellow actors took to Twitter to pay tribute to him. Russell Tovey, who appeared alongside him in The History Boys and went on to star in Being Human, wrote: 'Really sad. 'Our mate and leader has moved on to . the theatre in the sky. We will miss you so much Richard Griffiths... RIP you wonderful man.' John Simm, from Life on Mars and Doctor Who, added: 'RIP the mighty Richard Griffiths. Very sad news indeed.' Director Trevor Nunn said: 'Richard was an instinctive comic genius, and like a very few genius comedians of the past, he also became an actor of rare emotional and indeed tragic power. 'Richard inspired great love and spread much happiness, and as the Shakespeare he loved put it, ""There's a great spirit gone.""' In 2005, Griffiths won the Olivier award for . best actor for his performance as Mr Hector in The History Boys, a play . set in a 1980s Yorkshire grammar school which was later turned into a . film also starring Griffiths and directed by Nicholas Hytner. After the play transferred to Broadway, Griffiths added a much-coveted Tony award. He was already known to the British public for playing the lead role of Henry Crabbe in Pie in the Sky, a police drama broadcast on BBC1 from 1994 to 1997. Loss: Withnail co-star Richard E. Grant wrote of his sadness at the death of Griffiths, aka 'Uncle Monty' Victor: Griffiths accepting the Oliver award for best actor for his performance in The History Boys in 2006 . Plaudits: Griffiths posing with his 2006 Tony award after Alan Bennett's play transferred to Broadway . Griffiths was awarded the OBE for services to drama in the New Year's Honours 2008. He married Heather Gibson in 1980 after they met during a production of Lady Windermere's Fan in 1973. The couple lived in the village of Bearley, near Stratford-upon-Avon, and  had no children. The exact circumstances of Griffiths' death are unclear, and it is not known whether the operation was intended to address a long-term heart condition. The portly actor, whose weight problem . was blamed on medication he took as a child, played many starring roles . on television and in the West End. Sir Nicholas Hytner, director of the National Theatre, said Griffiths's unexpected death would devastate his 'army of friends'. 'Richard Griffiths wasn't only one of . the most loved and recognisable British actors - he was also one of the . very greatest,' he said. 'His . performance in The History Boys was quite overwhelming: a masterpiece . of wit, delicacy, mischief and desolation, often simultaneously. 'But . that was just one small part of a career that spanned Shakespeare, . cutting-edge new plays and major work in film and television.' Hit: Griffiths with the cast of Alan Bennett's The History Boys, including stars like James Corden, Russell Tovey and Dominic Cooper . On stage: The star made his name as a theatrical actor and returned to the form in The History Boys, pictured . Sir . Nicholas, who directed Griffiths in The History Boys and The Habit Of . Art, added: 'His currency as an actor was truth; as a colleague it was . hilarity. 'His . anecdotes were legendary. They were, literally, endless. They would go . on for hours, apparently without destination, constantly side-splitting. 'The . only way to stop them was to tell him you were walking away, though . there were always others in the audience so, as far as I know, he never . stopped. He was the life of every party.' Griffiths was well-known as an actor . who took a strong line against members of theatre audiences whose mobile . telephones rang out during performances. At least twice, he was known to have stopped a show to order people out of the theatre after their phones had persistently rung. Couple: Griffiths with his wife Heather at the Evening Standard Drama Awards in 2006 . Tributes: Other actors and media figures took to Twitter to express their condolences at Griffiths' death . He . was born on July 31 1947 in Thornaby-on-Tees, the son of a steelworker. His parents were both deaf and he learned sign language at an early age . so he could communicate with them. Griffiths developed an ear for dialects which subsequently landed him with several diverse roles. In . his childhood, he attempted to run away from home many times. He . dropped out of school at the age of 15 and worked as a porter, but his boss convinced him to go back to school. He decided to . attend a drama class at Stockton and Billingham College, then moved on to Manchester Polytechnic School of Drama. Subsequently . Griffiths earned a spot on BBC radio and worked in small theatres as an . actor and manager. But he built up a reputation as a Shakespearean . 'clown' with hilarious portrayals of characters such as Falstaff with . the Royal Shakespeare Company. After settling in Manchester, . he began to get lead roles in plays and on television. His first big . break was in 1976 film It Shouldn't Happen To A Vet, followed by roles . in contemporary and period pieces such as Gorky Park, Withnail And I, . The Smell Of Fear, Guarding Tess and Sleepy Hollow. New generation: Griffiths is known to some as wicked Vernon Dursley in the Harry Potter films . Cheerful: Griffiths arriving at the premiere of Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix in 2007 . Film credits included Chariots Of Fire, The French Lieutenant's Woman, GoldenEye, Gandhi and The Naked Gun 2 1/2.

"New York City plans to start sifting through earth and debris recovered from the World Trade Center site on Monday to look for the remains of victims from the attacks of September 11, 2001, officials said on Friday. The city's Office of the Chief Medical Examiner on Friday advised families of the dead about the new sifting operation, the first since 2010, a spokeswoman said in a statement. The Medical Examiner's office has identified remains of 1,634 people out of 2,752 killed when suicide hijackers crashed into the twin towers, leaving more than 1,000 families without any physical remains of those who died.

After the initial cleanup of the site, the city scaled back operations to search for remains, drawing criticism from families of the dead, who said they could not properly grieve. The city widened its search again in 2006. The next search will comb through 590 cubic yards (451 cubic meters) of excavated material taken from and near the World Trade Center site, said Caswell Holloway, deputy mayor for operations, in a memo to Mayor Michael Bloomberg made public by the Medical Examiner's office. Much of the site known as Ground Zero is a construction zone for new skyscrapers and a memorial where the twin towers once stood. The building under construction known as One World Trade Center has surpassed the Empire State Building as the tallest in New York and, when completed, would be the tallest in the Western Hemisphere at 1,776 feet.

"Nicked: Many of the cases in the dossier involve stolen iPhones . BBC staff are suspected of  a catalogue of crimes at work – many of which have never been reported to police. A dossier spanning four years shows theft and fraud allegations running at more than 500 a year. A significant number of the suspects were employees at the broadcaster. Documents also reveal allegations of sexual or indecent assault, as well as incidents of suspected drug use. Thefts of TVs, radios, iPhones, Blackberry devices and computers from BBC staff were endemic. In one instance, an employee was accused of having under-age sex while on assignment. Because the allegation could not be proved, the log showed the staffer was given only a warning. This allegation, like many others, was not passed on to police for further investigation because the BBC’s internal investigations service – which employs former police officers – decided it could not be substantiated. The disclosures follow the Jimmy Savile revelations which saw the corporation accused of turning a blind eye to decades of sex abuse by the presenter. The dossier, which has emerged on the day Lord Hall takes over as the BBC’s new director general, reveals an apparently lax culture at the BBC when it comes to investigating crimes. Many of the cases were closed with the remark – ‘no further action’. The incidents surfaced following a Freedom of Information request for details of incidents reported to the investigations service dating back to 2009. Hundreds of thousands of pounds have been wasted through the loss  of expensive equipment, either  misplaced or stolen in offices, or on location, around the country. And there are numerous details of thefts of televisions, smartphones, laptops, computer monitors and other technical equipment such as headphones and overhead projectors. In each file, the BBC records the corporation’s actions and whether  the police have been asked to become involved. In many cases, the unit took the view the amount involved would not trigger an outside police probe. Auntie accusations: The BBC dossier, spanning four years, shows more than 500 theft and fraud allegations a year, with a significant number of the suspects employees at the broadcaster . The log reveals that in 2009 there were 503 cases of theft and fraud, with 586 the following year. In 2011 the figure was 566 and last year it totalled 526. In many cases the location of the crime is not specified and there are no suspects, but in others it is clear that the culprit has been a BBC employee. On January 6 last year, the log records a ‘member of staff’ submitting false handwritten receipts for meals he did not take’ and reveals the employee was dismissed. Two months later, the log tells of the  dismissal of a member of staff for accepting ‘corrupt payments’ from an outside contractor. Other entries into the database centre around drug use and the accessing of pornography on BBC premises. Last night Matthew Sinclair of the TaxPayers’ Alliance criticised the BBC’s failure to punish criminal activity. ‘It is deeply worrying that criminal behaviour is occurring inside the BBC which is often not being properly investigated and therefore going unpunished,’ he said. ‘Licence fee payers will be shocked at the relaxed attitude which the Corporation appears to have taken in regard to thefts and frauds incurring significant financial losses. ‘This criminal behaviour is completely unacceptable and the BBC must be prepared to crack down on it and involve the police if similar cases occur in the future.’ A BBC spokesman said: ‘The investigations service takes all reported allegations and rumours seriously. ‘Experienced staff, many with police backgrounds, work with senior management, the HR department and the police to ensure all allegations are handled thoroughly and appropriately. In instances where serious allegations are borne out, this has often resulted both in police action as well as dismissal.’ The spokesman said many items reported stolen were recovered and  that the BBC ‘made every attempt to recover monies where it is deemed financially viable’.","Dossier spanning four years show many crimes never reported to the police .

"The house where Rudyard Kipling wrote some of his best-loved works including the Just So Stories has gone on sale for £1.6m. The beautiful five-bedroom home is located in the centre of Rottingdean, near Brighton, East Sussex and still features the study where the author penned some of his works. Artist Sir . Philip Burne-Jones 1899 even immortalised the study in one of his . portraits - which is now housed in the National Portrait Gallery. For sale: The five-bedroom home in East Sussex that the author used to rent is for sale for £1.6m . Property: The house, located next to the green in Rottingdean, East Sussex, boasts its own library . On the exterior of the house is a blue plaque - installed by the Kipling Society to commemorate the time Kipling spent in the property with his wife Carrie, the daughter of American agent and publisher Wolcott Balestier, and their children. The stunning house, complete with bay windows and gravel driveway, is on the market for . £1,595,000. It features four floors and includes a kitchen, dining room, family . room, library, hallway, dressing room, five bedrooms and two bathrooms. The author, whose works . include The Jungle Book and the Just So Stories, moved into the house, which backs on to the . village green, just before the turn of the 20th century. Historical: The Rudyard Kipling Society installed a plaque on the exterior of the home to commemorate the time the author spent there . Previously, the family had live in Vermont, America, before returning to Torquay, Devon following a dispute with Kipling's American agent. Kipling then lived in the Rottingdean house - called The Elms at the time - from 1897 to 1903. Kipling, his wife and their three . children Josephine, Elsie and baby John, moved into the property as the . writer wanted to be closer to his aunt - who lived next door. Art: The portrait of Rudyard Kipling sat in the house's study painted by Sir Philip Burne-Jones . The family remained in the home - for which Kipling reportedly paid three guineas a week - for six years. In one journal, Kipling wrote about the property: 'It was small, none too well built, but cheap.' While living . there, he enjoyed one of the most productive periods of his life, . writing the poem Recessional in 1897 for Queen Victoria's Diamond Jubilee. Controversial poem The White Man's Burden, about the obligation of white people to rule over those from other cultural backgrounds, was written in 1899. Kim  - a novel about political conflict between Russia and Britain in Central Asia following the second Afghan War - was also written in the house in 1902. The Just So stories - inspired by the bed-time stories Kipling would tell his eldest daughter Josephine while they lived at the house, was also penned in 1902. Kipling illustrated the first edition of the stories, also. It is thought that the name came from . his daughter's request for her father to repeat his stories for her just . as he had first told them, or 'Just So'. Sadly Josephine died of pneumonia, which she contracted on a family trip to visit Carrie's mother in American in 1902. The family moved to Burwash, East Sussex to a house called Bateman's which dated back to 1634, following her death. Some day Kipling, who by 1902 was one of the highest paid writers in the world, moved from the house because his neighbours kept looking over the wall that surrounds the property. Kipling stayed at Bateman's, around 50 miles from the Rottingdean house, until he died in 1936. Classic: Kipling, pictured later in life left, illustrated some editions of the Just So Stories, right . The home is described by the estate agent Winkworth, as in: 'A striking . spot in the centre of Rottingdean.' The . agent adds that the former home of the famous author, 'oozes grace, . poise and commands nothing less than your complete attention.' They say it is 'a . perfect fusion of space, light and intrinsic decoration, this charming . property is woven with the echoes of a globally renowned writer.' They add: 'A beautiful pond, delightful pub, and charming church are all within immediate reach.' The stories, first published in 1902, are fantastical accounts of how various phenomena came about. Typically, they have the theme of a particular animal being changed from its original form by the acts of man, or some magical . being. For example, one explains how a leopard got its spots - from an . Ethiopian hand-painting them on. The tale reads: 'Then the Ethiopian put his five fingers close together and pressed them all over the Leopard, and wherever the five fingers touched they left five little black marks, all close together.' Other tales see the Kangaroo getting . its powerful hind legs, long tail, and hopping gait after being chased . all day by a dingo. A forerunner of the book was Kipling's 'How Fear Came' which was included in The Second Jungle Book (1895). In it, Mowgli hears the story of how the tiger got his stripes. Kipling illustrated the original editions of the Just So Stories, see above. Other illustrators of the book include Joseph M. Gleeson. The tales remain popular today and have been even been published as Penguin Classics, above.","Kipling rented the five-bedroom house in the centre of Rottingdean, near Brighton, East Sussex from 1897 to 1903 .

"The stunning treasures from a sunken Spanish galleon have been revealed for the first time after the ship was rediscovered nearly 400 years on from its wreck in the Gulf of Mexico. The loss of the Buen Jesus y Nuestra Senora del Rosario along with seven other ships destroyed the Bank of Madrid - and even contributed to the collapse of the Spanish Empire. Now deep-sea divers believe they have found its wreck 400m deep, with 17,000 objects on board revealing that it was carrying gold, pearls - and even parrots. Treasure: Some of the 27 gold bars recovered from the wreck of Buen Jesus y Nuestra Senora del Rosario . Unique: These pearls are from a rare species of oyster found in seabeds off the coast of Venezuela . Precious: The loss of the treasure, such as this chain weighing half a kilogram, devastated Spain's economy . Galleon: This image of 16th-century Seville shows a ship similar to that lost in the Gulf of Mexico . The discovery unveiled today gives a fascinating glimpse into the sometimes unexpected treasures which made the colonial economy run. The wreck site, around 400 miles from the Florida Keys, contains 39 gold bars, and nearly 1,200 silver pieces of eight. More unusually, the site features more than 6,600 pearls being exported to Europe from the coast of Venezuela. The gems came from a type of oyster which was unique to South America but which was nearly extinct by the early 17th century thanks to over-exploitation by colonial traders. Bullion: A gold bar stamps with official marks certifying its purity and taxation status . Vessels: These ceramic jars and tableware were used to furnish the doomed ship on its voyage . Precious: A selection of the jewels and precious stones being transported from the New World to the Old . Cash: Silver coins apparently mined in the colonies and taken back to Spain to prop up the ruling power . Certificate: A stamp reading 'en rada' operating as a sort of guarantee of the gold's origin . And it was not only wildlife to suffer from the oyster trade - 60,000 Caribbean natives are believed to have died while diving for pearls on behalf of the Spanish. In addition to the precious metals and jewels, two bird's bones were found at the site, thought to have come from a blue-headed parrot. The parrots made popular pets because of their bright plumage and ability to mimic human speech, but this is the first time the remains of one have been found in a shipwreck. Another glimpse of everyday life in the early modern world comes from a tortoiseshell comb for lice apparently made by a member of the ship's crew. Jar: The artefacts found by the Odyssey expedition have not been seen for nearly 400 years . Astrolabe: This was used to navigate by the stars but did not help the ship avoid a devastating hurricane . Riches: But the empire was deep in debt and the wreck of its ships contributed to its downfall . Examination: An archaeologist holding silver retrieved from the wreck 400m deep in the Gulf of Mexico . The Buen Jesus y Nuestra Senora del Rosario was one of a fleet of 28 Spanish merchants hit by a hurricane on September 5, 1622. Eight were sunk, killing 500 people on board and hiding their treasure for nearly four centuries. The Spanish economy had been relying on the boost it would have received from the ships' arrival, and the disaster contributed to the eventual downfall of the formerly all-powerful colonial empire. To the rescue: The Seahawk Retriever moored over the site of the shipwreck . Delicate: Cutting-edge technology was used to retrieve the valuable treasures from the seabed . Handle with care: Team members examine containers full of ceramic jars from the Buen Jesus . Machinery: This filtration system designed to sift small finds was specially designed for the expedition . Excavations at the site of the wreck have been going on for more than 20 years, using deep-sea technology developed by British engineers to drill for oil in the North Sea. They were carried out by Odyssey Marine Exploration, whose president Greg Stemm told The Times: 'This is the major find of our time.' The objects excavated from the Rosario are going on display at the company's headquarters in Florida. Oceans Odyssey 3, a book on the shipwreck and its contents, is published today by Oxbow Books. Find: The site of the shipwreck is around 400 miles away from the Florida Keys .

"This is the astonishing 'glass' frog which manages to elude its predators with its see through skin - rendering it almost invisible. The Fleischmann's Glass Frog looks as if it is changing colour as it moves, as the background shows through its transparent flesh.

Predators don't have a hop in hell of seeing this crafty frog - whose see through skin makes it almost invisible . The Fleishman's Glass Frog appears to change colour when it moves because the background shows through its transparent flesh . Photographer Thomas Marent snapped the frogs - with bulging yellow eyes - underneath leaves at a nature reserve in Choco, Colombia. One can even be seen sitting next to her transparent eggs, where the heads and tails of developing tadpoles can be clearly seen inside. Mr Marent, 46, said: 'I was looking on the underside of leaves when I found a beautiful female glass frog moistening a clutch of eggs attached to the leaf. 'This is is extremely rare. 'The tadpoles inside the eggs were already well developed, and it was almost time for them to hatch. 'Nearby I also found two beautiful males of the same species. These frogs normally look small and green when viewed from above. Photographer Thomas Marent snapped the frogs - with bulging yellow eyes - underneath leaves at a nature reserve in Choco, Colombia . Despite it's amazing camouflage you can still see its heart, intestines, and red blood vessels . 'However, the skin covering their undersides and extremities is largely unpigmented and very thin in places. 'That means it is possible to see the blood vessels running through the body, and even the the internal organs working away inside. The frog has transparent eggs, where the heads and tails of developing tadpoles can be clearly seen inside . 'Background colours show through the frogs minute bodies, helping them stay out of sight among the green leaves.' Mr Marent, from Baden, Switzerland, said the frog returned to her eggs regularly to add a protective coat of mucus, which keeps them moist and protects against fungus and parasites. He added: 'It is hard to tell which part of this frog is pigmented green and which areas are coloured by the leaves showing through its transparent skin.'","Fleischmann's Glass Frog appears to change colour when it moves .

"Hackers: Elvis Rafael Rodriguez (left) and Emir Yasser Yeje (right), of New York were arrested for the robbery . Seven cyber hackers have been charged with stealing $45 million from 27 countries worldwide in one of the world's biggest ever bank heists. The sophisticated cyber criminals are said to have stolen the cash from thousands of bank automated teller machines in just 10 hours. They used hacked debit-card data to make 40,500 transactions worldwide, U.S. prosecutors said today. Authorities said they arrested these seven U.S. citizens and residents of Yonkers, New . York: Jael Mejia Collado, Joan Luis Minier Lara, Evan Jose . Peña, Jose Familia Reyes, Elvis Rafael Rodriguez, Emir Yasser Yeje and . Chung Yu-Holguin. The eighth defendant charged in the . indictment, Alberto Yusi Lajud-Peña, also known as 'Prime' and . 'Albertico,' was murdered on April 27 in the Dominican Republic, . according to prosecutors. Lynch said it was unclear whether the murder . was related to the cybercrime case. Members of the global criminal . organization hacked into two credit card processors and used stolen data . to make the withdrawals, during two separate coordinated incidents in . December 2012 and February 2013, the Justice Department said. The . government charged eight individuals in New York with participating in . the larger scheme by withdrawing $2.8 million in thousands of ATM . transactions, in what U.S. Attorney Loretta Lynch said was the . second-biggest bank robbery in the history of New York City. Scroll down for video . Caught at the ATM: Jose Familia Reyes was caught on camera on New York's Third Avenue making four withdrawals of $4,015 . ATM withdrawals: Jose Familia Reyes is caught on camera making large cash withdraws from various ATMs around Manhattan . Across town: Jose Familia Reyes makes more withdrawals on New York's Broadway . Lynch said it was likely that the . headquarters of the global scheme was located outside the United States . and that the current charges focused only on the New York-based cell. Investigators were examining whether other cells were operating elsewhere in the United States, she said. 'In the place of guns and masks, this cyber crime organization used laptops and the Internet. 'Moving . as swiftly as data over the Internet, the organization worked its way . from the computer systems of international corporations to the streets . of New York City, with the defendants fanning out across Manhattan to . steal millions of dollars from hundreds of ATMs in a matter of hours,' said Lynch, whose office in Brooklyn, New York, brought the case. The big heist: Jose Familia Reyes continues down Broadway in Manhattan, making cash withdrawals of over $2,000 from each ATM . Second biggest bank robbery in NYC history: Jose Familia Reyes was part of the international cyber hacking ring that stole millions . Part of the gang: Jose Familia Reyes was one of seven defendants, all U.S. citizens and residents of Yonkers, New York . The case demonstrates the major threat that cyber crime poses to banks around the world. Security experts frequently identify electronic fraud as one of the key challenges facing banks today. 'Hackers only need to find one . vulnerability to cause millions of dollars of damage,' said Mark Rasch, a . former federal cyber crimes prosecutor, based in Bethesda, Maryland. In . the December attack, hackers gained access to an Indian credit card . processor that handled prepaid Mastercard Inc debit cards for National . Bank of Ras Al Khaimah PSC, or RAKBANK, according to a criminal . indictment. In . February, the hackers broke into the system of a U.S.-based credit card . processor to steal account numbers for prepaid Mastercard debit cards . issued by Bank of Muscat, the indictment said. The second operation was far larger than the first attack, eventually totaling $40 million in losses to Bank of Muscat. Evidence: Images from the iPhone of Elvis Rafael Rodriguez (left) show the hacker with  Emir Yasser Yeje (right), of New York, along with cash and items bought with the stolen money . New York based ring: Charts showing information related to eight members belonging to a New York-based cell of a global cyber criminal organization are displayed at a news conference today . In . late February, Bank Muscat disclosed that it would take an impairment . charge of up to 15 million rials ($39 million) because it had been . defrauded overseas using 12 prepaid debit cards used for travel. That charge was equal to more than half of the 25 million rials profit it posted in its first quarter ended March 31. The indictment does not identify the processor companies. Bank representatives could not be reached for comment outside of regular business hours. In . both cases, the hackers boosted the available balance for each card and . eliminated the withdrawal limits, allowing them to take out huge sums . of money from ATMs in what prosecutors called an 'unlimited operation.' A . single account number, for instance, yielded nearly $9 million in . profits, including $2.4 million in New York City alone, prosecutors . said. The hackers . distributed the account numbers to coordinated 'casher' crews stationed . across the globe, who siphoned millions of dollars from ATMs within a . span of hours in December 2012 and February 2013. Map of the hit areas: This map shown at a press conference in New York show the ATMS which the cyber hackers hit . Worldwide ring: In February, the hackers broke into the system of a U.S.-based credit card processor to steal account numbers for prepaid Mastercard debit cards issued by Bank of Muscat (pictured in Oman), the indictment said . One of the New York defendants was caught in surveillance footage from ATMs in Manhattan during the February operation, prosecutors said. After the cards were shut down, cashers laundered the proceeds, often by purchasing luxury goods, and sent a portion of the money back to the organization's leaders, prosecutors said. Prosecutors said they seized hundreds of thousands of dollars in cash and bank accounts, as well as two Rolex watches and a Mercedes SUV, from the New York defendants. No individual bank accounts were compromised by the scheme, Lynch said. It wasn't immediately known which lawyers were representing the defendants.","Hackers made 40,500 transactions in 10 hours in 27 countries .

"More than 100 City bankers will be handed £42million in unpaid bonuses after their employer lost a legal battle to block handouts of up to £1.6million each. Court of Appeal judges said today Commerzbank was wrong to refuse to pay an average £400,000 per person  at the height of the financial crisis. in 2009 Commerzbank had saved rival Dresdner Kleinwort from collapse after it lost billions of pounds and had to be bailed out by German taxpayers. Lost: Germany's Commerzbank refused to pay 104 bankers their bonuses at the height of the financial crisis, but lost their Appeal Court case today . As part of the deal they took on Dresdner bankers in London and then refused to pay their 104 new staff the £42million bonus pot they had been promised by their ailing former employer. Refusal: The bankers (file picture) were to receive up to £1.6m from their previous employer, which had to be bailed out . The legal battle over the cash has lasted four years, but High Court judges today found in favour of the bankers and said that the decision was a breach of contract by Commerzbank, and they must now pay the cash in full. A panel comprising of Lord Justice Elias sitting with Lord Justice Maurice Kay, Vice President of the Court of Appeal, and Lord Justice Beatson said they rejected the bank's concerns case. Their decision upheld a previous High Court ruling last May saying that the bankers were entitled to the cash . Commerzbank had argued that the judge had not treated their arguments objectively, and that it was artificial to treat the promised bonuses distinct from financial performance. At a time of continuing political and public anger at fat cat bank bonuses the 104 bankers. had accused the bank of broken promises over their share of a guaranteed bonus pool announced by Dresdner Kleinworth in August 2008. As well as being ordered to pay the bonuses Commerzbank have been left with a legal bill estimated at £5 million for a hearing lasting more than three weeks. They will also face the costs of a three day appeal which could add another £500,000 to their legal bill. Decision: Judges at the High Court found that it was a breach of contract not to pay the £42m promised . A Commerzbank spokesman said: 'Commerzbank is disappointed with this decision and is considering its legal options. It is a regrettable outcome in view of the on-going regulatory, public and shareholder calls to establish a sound relationship between banks' performance and variable remuneration. 'It remains the Bank's belief that as a matter of law, no binding contractual commitment was made, that bonus amounts communicated were provisional and that it was reasonable and rational to reduce the bonuses in the light of the 6.5bn euro loss that Dresdner's investment banking operation posted for 2008. 'In other jurisdictions, national courts upheld Commerzbank's position. In October 2011 the highest court in Germany, the Bundesarbeitsgericht, ruled in Commerzbank's favour on the same case for employees whose contracts fell under Germany employment law in the third and last instance. 'In Italy and Japan, the bank succeeded in having claims with the same facts dismissed. In New York arbitration proceedings earlier this year, the claims were rejected.' 'The individual claims range from 15,000 Euros to 2 million Euros, with the total claim amounting to 50 million Euros - £42 million. 'It was claimed the bonus pool was created to keep staff but they only received 10 per cent of what they were promised and launched the legal action to get the missing 90 per cent. 'But the Bank claimed that under a Material Adverse Change clause and because there was a deterioration in the bank's performance they were entitled to reduce bonus payouts.'","Staff were promised up to £1.6million each at the height of the financial crisis .

"David Cameron today said he was 'proud' to have backed same sex marriage . David Cameron today sought to heal deep divisions in the Tory party, insisting opponents of his policy to legalise gay marriage are not 'wrong-headed or bigoted'. But the Prime Minister said he was 'proud' to have backed same-sex weddings, revealing his hope that young boys at school today who think they might be gay and are being bullied will 'stand a bit taller' as a result of equality laws. In an attempt to quell the mutiny in Conservative ranks he promised there would be no more controversial social policies like gay marriage, and warned Tory rebels he will not be bulldozed into changing his policy on Europe. Plans to legalise gay marriage cleared the Commons last night, despite efforts by Tory backbenchers to derail the legislation. There was applause in the House after MPs voted by 366 to 161, a majority of 205, to give the Marriage (Same Sex Couples) Bill a third reading. But the policy was opposed by 136 Tory MPs, amid warnings local party associations are haemorrhaging support as opponents of the move tear up their membership cards. Mr Cameron admitted gay marriage has been deeply unpopular within Tory ranks, but insisted it was the right thing to do. In a passionate a deeply personal defence of same sex weddings, Mr Cameron said: 'I think marriage is a wonderful institution, it helps people to commit to each other. I think it’s such a good institution it should be available to gay people as well as heterosexuals. 'There will be young boys in schools . today, who are gay, who are worried about being bullied, who are worried . about what society thinks of them, who can see that the highest . Parliament in the land has said that their love is the same as everyone . else’s love, and that we believe in equality. 'I think they’ll stand that bit taller today, and I’m proud of the fact that has happened.' Mr Cameron is in Brussels today for talks on tax avoidance, where he spoke to European Parliament President Martin Schulz, right, Croatia's Prime Minister Zoran Milanovic, second left, and Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte . David . Cameron tried to draw a line under the deeply damaging row over claims a . senior Tory figure dismissed Tory activists as 'mad, swivel-eyed . loons'. Conservative co-chairman Lord Feldman, a close friend of the Premier, has denied making the remark to two journalists. Mr Cameron said: 'It is not what I think, it is not what the people around me think. 'I . think sometimes the media have a view that there is a complete . disconnect between the politicians who stand for election and the . volunteers who support us. I . think that is completely wrong. I think of the volunteers in my own . constituency, they are not just my friends and my supporters, I feel I . am one of them. He said the Tory party was a 'broad . church' of opinion but being in government meant taking tough choices. 'When you make decisions sometimes you make opponents and enemies.' 'Of course the gay marriage issue has been divisive and I totally respect those who take a different opinion. 'I . don’t think in any way that to oppose gay marriage to be wrong-headed . or bigoted. This is a different point of view but we should respect each . other,' he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. But he sought to reassure the party grassroots that he will not go to war with them again. 'Is . this the first of many issues like that? No it isn’t. 'The government is . going to be absolutely focused on the big picture which is fixing our economy, reforming welfare, making sure there are good schools for our children to go to. 'It is all about making sure Britain can win in this global race, and we’ll do that by backing the aspirations of people in this country, by being on the side of people who want to work had and do the right thing. 'I think, frankly, for the next two years that is going to be the absolute focus that I have, that the Conservative party has, that the Government has.' Mr Cameron said the party had managed to have a disagreement on Europe 'about an issue we actually agree about' over the last few weeks. Before traveling to the EU summit, Mr Cameron insisted he will not be pressured into changing his Europe policy . Mr Cameron issued a blunt warning to Tory Eurosceptics that he will not be bullied into changing his policy on the EU. There are growing fears in Downing . Street that more than 100 Tory rebels now believe they are able to exert . influence over Mr Cameron, particularly on Europe. In . January he promised to renegotiate terms with Brussels, before staging . an in-out referendum by 2017.But 114 Tory MPs backed an unprecedented . vote against the Queen's Speech for not promising a  referendum sooner. Some want him to defy the Lib Dems in the coalition and legislate for a referendum before the 2015 election. Mr Cameron was forced to interrupt a . visit to the United States to rush out a draft bill legislating to stage . an in-out vote in an attempt to placate his critics who want a tougher . line on Europe. In a sign of concern that he is being . buffeted by Eurosceptics, in the way that John Major's government . unraveled in the 1990s, Mr Cameron was forced to state publicly that he . would not be pressured into changing his Europe policy. 'Let . me say, this policy, it doesn’t matter the pressure I come under from . outside the Conservative party, or in Europe, or inside the Conservative . party, this policy isn’t going to change,' the PM said. 'The . question isn’t going to change. The number of referenda isn’t going to . change. The date we hold this referendum isn’t going to change. 'This policy isn’t going to change, no matter what pressure I come under from within the Tory party.' Critics, . including former Tory Chancellor Lord Lawson, who claim his plan to . renegotiate Britain's EU membership is doomed to fail are 'just wrong' he added. Mr Cameron claimed there was 'incredible unity and agreement' in the Tory party and the wider country on Europe. And . he boasted that he had the 'boldest, clearest, most straightforward . policy on Europe that any party leader has had for 30 or 40 years'. 'The . Conservative party managed to have a disagreement over the last couple . of weeks about an issue that we actually agree about – that there should . be a renegotiation, there should be a referendum. 'Now . all we need to do is focus on the substance of the policy, and the . substance of the policy – a renegotiation, a referendum – is backed by . the overwhelming majority of the British people, because it’s the right . thing to do.' After weeks of turmoil both Mr Cameron and deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg today vowed that the coalition would last until 2015 . Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg . today used a highly-combative speech to warn the warring Conservative . Party it must ‘get back to governing’. He . said Tory infighting over Europe and gay marriage has been an . ‘unwelcome distraction’ which is undermining public support for the . Government. Key Queen’s . Speech announcements on issues such as pensions and long-term care for . the elderly, have been obscured by internal ‘political punch ups’ in the . Tory Party, Mr Clegg claimed. Mr . Clegg added: ‘Anyone watching would be forgiven for asking: what are . these politicians doing? So it’s time to get back to governing – . providing the leadership and focus the people of Britain deserve in . these difficult times.’ Mr Cameron hinted in a recent interview that he could continue to govern even if the Lib Dems left the coalition. But today he insisted he would continue to hold power with Mr Clegg up to the day of the election. 'That is absolutely my intention and has always been. This is a Government that has an enormous programme of work,' he said. 'Here . we are in year three of this Government and here we are doing a massive . reform of the state pension system to provide a generous single-tier . pension for everyone on retirement. 'Here's . a government that is cracking a problem that has eluded government for . years of making sure people don't have to sell their home to pay for . care. 'These are big bold . reforms. To anyone who doubts the life there is left in the coalition, I . would argue there is more to come. Very bold reforming and strong . government, and that is what we will be right up till polling day.'","Prime Minister 'proud' of same-sex weddings and hopes young gay boys will 'stand taller today'

"Inspire is produced by Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula and contains exhortations to carry out so-called 'lone wolf' terrorist attacks by self-motivated groups and individuals. Pictured is an advert from the magazine . The Woolwich terror attack has chilling echoes of a previous plot to kidnap and behead a British Muslim soldier. Five men were jailed in 2008 after police smashed a Birmingham-based terror cell’s plan to burn a kidnapped soldier’s body and parade his head on a stick as a warning to other Muslims against joining the British Army. Thankfully, ringleader Parviz Khan failed to identify a soldier to target before they were detained by the security services. Khan had links to Al Qaeda in Pakistan and said in a conversation bugged by MI5: ‘Like that, I think you cut it off like you cut a pig. Then you put it on a stick and we say, this is to all Muslims man [who] want to join the Kuffar (non-believer) army – this is what will happen to you. ‘Then we throw the body, burn it, send the video to the chacha [Al Qaeda leaders]. The chacha can release it there. These people gonna go crazy.’ The words of Khan, jailed for life, were an ominous warning. Last night, as armed police guarded two men suspected of killing and trying to behead a soldier near Woolwich barracks, detectives were urgently trying to establish how the killers were radicalised. Officers were checking jihadi websites where preachers of hate urge Islamic extremists to behead soldiers. The authorities will also be investigating whether the attackers had been spurred into action by reading Al Qaeda’s English-language magazine, Inspire. The publication is produced by Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula and contains exhortations to carry out so-called ‘lone wolf’ terrorist attacks by self-motivated groups and individuals. Articles and ‘jihadi advertisements’ have urged people to carry out attacks with knives and to run people down in vehicles. The Boston Marathon bombers used instructions contained in the first issue of the magazine to build and detonate their devices. The guide was called ‘How to build a bomb in the kitchen of your mom’. Inspire has been linked to at least 15 terrorism cases and Al Qaeda made an abortive attempt to publish the 11th issue of the magazine just days ago. It is believed that intelligence agencies intervened in the publication process, meaning that the file was blank when people who downloaded it tried to open it. A previous issue was doctored so a section on bomb-making was replaced with cupcake recipes. Inciting hatred: A Muslim protest in London in 2006 . Documents such as Inspire are circulated on a network of websites which are attracting large audiences. A recent survey suggested the ten leading websites linked to Al Qaeda have 125,000 registered members between them and may be attracting as many as 250,000 visits per day. The network is currently circulating a new English magazine produced by the Pakistan Taliban, which calls on supporters in the UK to murder teenage human rights campaigner Malala Yousufzai. Another possibility, which will be considered by counter-terrorism officers, is that the minds of the killers of the British soldier were poisoned in a mosque or even in prison, an increasingly popular recruiting ground for groups linked to Al Qaeda. It was not clear whether the men were on the intelligence radar of the security services or were ‘clean skins’, not known to police. Some witnesses claimed the soldier was beheaded but there was no immediate confirmation of how he died. What is not in doubt is that he suffered a terrible knife attack. The head and the sword have a specific place in the rhetoric, heraldry and history of Islam. There is no shortage of passages in the Koran that jihadists can interpret to support their propaganda. Vigil in the street: Three women bravely stand near the body of the soldier, saying prayers and trying to offer comfort . Chapter 47, Verse 4, is a favourite of those with evil intentions: ‘When you meet the unbelievers (in battle), smite their necks until you have crushed them . . .’ Jihadists have used this as justification for the scores of beheadings of non-believers in Iraq.When the word ‘behead’ is typed into Google, the search engine automatically suggests completing the sentence with ‘those who insult Islam’ – suggesting this is the most common search term beginning with that word. The attack in Woolwich is one of several attempts to kill soldiers and MPs. Student Roshonara Choudhry became a heroine in jihadi circles for stabbing MP Stephen Timms during his constituency surgery in Beckton, East London, in May 2010. Mr Timms survived. A cell of terrorists from Luton was jailed last month at Woolwich Crown Court for discussing an attack on a Territorial Army barracks with a bomb attached to a remote controlled car. Three weeks ago six men pleaded guilty in the same court to planning an attack on an EDL rally in Dewsbury, West Yorkshire, using machetes and sawn-off shotguns and a home-made bomb. Placards calling for anyone who insults the prophet Mohammed to be beheaded were waved during an angry protest in London in 2006. One man, Mizanur Rahman, who carried a placard that said ‘Behead those who insult Islam’, was later found guilty of inciting racial hatred.

"People who call gay sex ‘disgusting’ will be allowed to stay in the UK Independence Party. Nigel Farage defended party members with ‘old-fashioned’ views about homosexuality, as he warned that with the government passing same-sex weddings ‘nobody knows where it will end up’. MPs last night backed the Marriage (Same Sex Couples) Bill, but Mr Farage said ministers were ‘picking a war with middle England’. UKIP leader Nigel Farage accused the government of picking a fight with Middle Britain . Mr Farage was challenged over reports of that a UKIP online forum was used by a party candidates to allegedly brand gay sex ‘disgusting’ and said that homosexuals were not ‘normal’. The UKIP leader conceded that racist comments allegedly made were ‘over the top’ and would be discussed by the party's national executive in two weeks' time. But he held back from criticising remarks allegedly made by another council candidate, who was reported by the Sunday Mirror to have used an online forum to say that gay sex was ‘disgusting’. The candidate added that ‘what irritates me is the way they and their leftie, neo-Commie followers seem to want to force the rest of us to consider them as normal’. Mr Farage told BBC Radio 2's Jeremy Vine Show: ‘That is an old-fashioned view that you would hear in private bridge clubs and golf clubs and probably British Legion clubs up and down the length and breadth of the country. ‘If you are suggesting that we should become so politically correct that we should kick out anyone who holds a slightly old-fashioned view, frankly that would be the death of debate in politics in Britain.’ David Cameron today said he was 'proud' to have backed same sex marriage . Mr Farage said that his fellow-UKIP MEP Roger Helmer had gone ‘too far’ by drawing a link between gay marriage and incest. But he added: ‘The point he was making is if we change the definition of marriage, nobody knows where it will end up. ‘We are about to redefine marriage - something that has been a fundamental staple of our society for very many centuries. 'The 1950s world where homosexuals could be sent to prison has ended. ‘We now have civil partnerships. What the Government is now doing is picking a war with middle England on something that wasn't in their manifesto and frankly there isn't much demand for.’ However, Prime Minister David Cameron today issued a staunch defence of the policy, arguing young gay boys at school could ‘stand a little taller’ knowing that Parliament has given them equality. Mr Cameron admitted gay marriage has been deeply unpopular within Tory ranks, but insisted it was the right thing to do. In a passionate a deeply personal defence of same sex weddings, Mr Cameron said: 'I think marriage is a wonderful institution, it helps people to commit to each other. I think it’s such a good institution it should be available to gay people as well as heterosexuals. 'There will be young boys in schools today, who are gay, who are worried about being bullied, who are worried about what society thinks of them, who can see that the highest Parliament in the land has said that their love is the same as everyone else’s love, and that we believe in equality. 'I think they’ll stand that bit taller today, and I’m proud of the fact that has happened.' He said the Tory party was a 'broad church' of opinion but being in government meant taking tough choices. 'When you make decisions sometimes you make opponents and enemies.' 'Of course the gay marriage issue has been divisive and I totally respect those who take a different opinion. 'I don’t think in any way that to oppose gay marriage to be wrong-headed or bigoted. This is a different point of view but we should respect each other,' he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.","UKIP candidate complained online that homosexuals are not 'normal'

"The Foreign Secretary William Hague will propose a new 'red card' system to allow EU countries to block unwelcome laws . The Tories are to demand a new ‘red card’ system so that national parliaments can block unwelcome EU laws. As part of David Cameron’s bid to renegotiate the UK’s relationship with Brussels, Foreign Secretary William Hague will today reveal the first concrete demand for reform of the European Union ahead of an in-out referendum in 2017. In a hard-hitting speech, Mr Hague will call for national parliaments, such as the House of Commons, to be able to overrule legislation proposed by the European Commission if enough legislatures call for it to be thrown out. Mr Hague will say that the European Parliament has ‘failed’ to introduce democratic accountability to the EU. And he will argue that the time has come to return powers to elected politicians in nation states who are far more accountable to their voters than MEPs. Little known and little used powers exist that allow parliaments in member states to issue a ‘yellow card’ to the European Commission, which proposes all EU legislation. But that device only forces the unelected Commission to think again about laws, it cannot block them altogether. In a speech to a think tank in Germany, Mr Hague will spell out plans to give national MPs the right to issue a ‘red card’ instead and throw out the plans altogether. The Prime Minister David Cameron has promised to renegotiate Britain's relationship with Brussels . The speech, to the Konigswinter Conference, is the first time a senior Tory has spelt out any of the demands that Mr Cameron will make when he comes to re-negotiate Britain’s relationship with Brussels. The Foreign Office is also running a ‘Balance of Competencies Review’ of where power lies between Brussels and member states but it is not expected to draw up a shopping list of powers that the UK wants repatriated before the general election in 2015. Mr Hague believes that he will win support for the ‘red card’ plan from other Northern European countries, including Germany.","Foreign Secretary to spell out first concrete demand for reform .

"On the shoreline of Hawaii's most famous beach, a decaying swimming pool attracts little attention from wandering tourists. A few glance curiously at the crumbling Waikiki Natatorium, a salt water pool built in 1927 as a memorial to the 10,000 soldiers from Hawaii who served in World War I. But the monument's walls are caked with salt and rust, and passers-by are quickly diverted by the lure of sand and waves. The faded structure has been closed to the public for decades, the object of seemingly endless debate over whether it should be demolished or restored to its former glory. The latest plan is to replace it with a beach, more practical for the state's lucrative tourism industry - and millions of dollars cheaper, according to state and local officials. They say a full restoration could cost nearly $70 million. Closed: The locked gates of the faded Waikiki Natatorium which has been closed to the public since 1979 . The corroding monument has challenged the community to maneuver a delicate question: How do we honor those who have served when memorials deteriorate and finances are tight? Similar debates have been playing out across the country. The National Trust for Historic Preservation waged a two-and-a-half-year fight to restore the aging Tomb of the Unknowns in Arlington National Cemetery in Washington, DC, when some people proposed replacing it. Far less disagreement surrounded a decision to update the War Memorial Opera House in San Francisco after a powerful earthquake in 1989. In Greensboro, North Carolina residents have been grappling with what to do with the city's own decaying tribute to the soldiers of World War I. Former glory: The Greensboro World War Memorial Stadium in North Carolina hosted minor league baseball for decades and served as a location for notable sports films such as 'Leatherheads' but is now falling into disrepair . The Greensboro World War Memorial . Stadium hosted minor league baseball for decades and even served as a . location for notable sports films such as ""Leatherheads"" and ""Bull . Durham."" Yet, despite continued use by kids and college-level athletes, the structure is falling into disrepair. The historic pebbled facade is falling off, and some of the bleachers are blocked off because of crumbling concrete, said David Wharton, a Greensboro resident who is fighting as a member of his neighborhood association to restore the structure. It's been a losing battle. The city rejected two referendums to fund renovations and chose to build a new stadium for minor league baseball instead of fixing up the old one. As a classics professor at University of North Carolina-Greensboro, Wharton has a soft spot for historic places. But he recognizes there are many other priorities competing for the millions of dollars it would take to restore the stadium. A city group is exploring different ways to use the space, and preservation advocates hope the monument can be saved even if that means changing the stadium's purpose. For many residents, the structure's architectural and historic significance pales in comparison to more immediate needs. 'The war was a long time ago,' Wharton said. 'I don't think it's meaningful for most people.' Sometimes, communities decide that memorials aren't worth the price. Pre-loved: Despite continued use by kids and college-level athletes, officials opted not to renovate the World War Memorial Stadium in Greensboro, North Carolina and built a new stadium instead . In Michigan's upper peninsula, the Wakefield Memorial Building once stood as a grand structure overlooking a lake in Wakefield, an old mining town. The memorial, built in 1924 to commemorate the sacrifices of World War I soldiers, was expansive, including a banquet hall, meeting room and theater. By the 1950s, the community couldn't afford the upkeep of the building and sold it to a private owner. Over the years, there were attempts to renovate the structure. But it was deemed too expensive and by 2010, the building was demolished. John Siira, the city manager, said there are plans to build a new memorial at the site, including a City Hall and library. Demolished: Wakefield Memorial Building in Michigan, seen here in 2009, was built in 1924 to commemorate the sacrifices of WWI soldiers but proved too expensive to maintain and was torn down in 2010 . But the project is on hold, and Siira said he's not sure when construction will start or when the project will pick up again. The lot where the building used to stand is now an empty lawn. The snow melted just last week, remnants of a long winter. In Honolulu, the fight over the beachside memorial is far from over. Jason Woll, who manages the beaches and parks in Waikiki, says the salty air, crashing waves and decades-old construction material have contributed to the memorial's demise. 'Unfortunately this may have had its day in the sun,' Woll said. 'It's a World War I memorial but quite frankly, it looks like it's been through war.' Crumbling: Honolulu Mayor Kirk Caldwell believes it's more respectful to the memory of soldiers who served in WWI to demolish the decaying Waikiki Natatorium than to let it crumble into the sea . Hawaii state and local officials recently announced a proposal to tear down the building and have started analyzing the plan - a process expected to take at least a year. Honolulu Mayor Kirk Caldwell says the demolition has been a long time coming. 'The greater disrespect is allowing the pool to continue to crumble and fall into the sea,' Caldwell said. Caldwell says the new beach would better serve local residents and plans to preserve the memorial's arch will honor the soldiers. Demolishing the structure for $18 million is much cheaper than the $69 million price tag attached to full renovation, he said. But an organization called Friends of the Natatorium says the city's cost analysis is wrong and renovation would in fact be cheaper than demolition. The group, led by former state lawmaker Peter Apo, wants a moratorium on any plans to destroy the memorial to give the group time to fund-raise for restoration . Danger: The once-great swimming pool was built as a World War I memorial, but is now infested with sharks as authorities argue over its future . Apo says because the building is on the National Register of Historic Places, a restoration campaign could attract . philanthropy from across the nation. But he acknowledges that it could . be hard to garner public support. World War I doesn't carry the same . significance in Hawaii as World War II, and many people like the idea of . a new beach. The site is such a safety hazard that public access has been blocked since 1979 - well past the pool's days of hosting legendary athletes like Olympic swimmer and surf icon Duke Kahanamoku. Crabs scuttle between 'Danger' signs lining the building's edges, and sharks swim in the pool, beneath the cracks of the crumbling floor. 'We're a nation of short memory,' Apo said.","Hawaii's Waikiki Natatorium pool was built in 1927 as a memorial to the 10,000 Hawaiian soldiers who served in WWI .

"A Chinese property group is closing in on a deal to buy Britain's biggest luxury yachtmaker Sunseeker. The firm, whose Predator 108 model appeared in the James Bond film Casino Royale, is expected to be bought by Beijing-based Dalian Wanda for around £300million. It is the latest in a string of British companies to have been snapped up by Chinese buyers in recent years.

Wang Jianlin, chairman and founder of Dalian Wanda, told the Financial Times: 'We bought the best yacht company in the UK.' Mr Wang is known to be fan of Sunseeker, having bought a Predator 108 Special Edition model in 2010. A spokesman for Sunseeker confirmed that the company is in discussions with a third party interested in buying a majority stake. She described the buyout as a 'significant investment' in the business but insisted 'one thing is for sure, Sunseeker will remain a British brand'. It is understood any deal would be on the basis that manufacturing and design operations remain in Poole to protect the jobs of around 2,300 people. The buyout would represent a major turnaround for Sunseeker which came . to the brink of disaster as a result of the banking crisis in 2010.

But after a refinancing agreement backed by Dublin-based investment group FL Partners it returned to . profit, announcing orders were already up for 2013. Popular with Arab royalty and Russian oligarchs, the directors said they were seeking to expand into areas including Asia, Russia and Brazil. Founded by Robert Braithwaite in 1968, Sunseeker is now an international company with an annual turnover of almost £290million a year. Its range of luxury yachts varies from sleek, speed merchants to huge vessels with rooms for five cabins and home cinema system. Customers include Arab royalty and Russian oligarchs as well as celebrities of all kinds from film stars to sports icons. Sunseeker models have appeared in several James Bond films, famously racing up the Thames in The World Is Not Enough and most recently in Casino Royale when one is owned by villain Le Chiffre. Robert Braithwaite never dreamed of having such international success when he learned his trade working for his father's engine-servicing company. Founded with a team of seven people, Sunseeker now employees around 2,300. In 2002 Braithwaite was named Entrepreneur of the Year. 'I was always a person with enormous ambition, but I never dreamed of this,' he told the BBC at the time. The company has ridden out the economic pressures of the banking crisis with profits last year set to reach £20.8million.

"This is the heart-stopping moment a huge tree fell down in an exclusive London square - just metres from where children were stood in a nursery playground. The enormous poplar tree, around 10ft wide and 60ft tall, crushed several cars in Colville Square in the upmarket borough of Kensington and Chelsea today. In a moment of incredible good fortune, the tree fell from inside the secluded square, but landed outside and across the road. A spokesman for Kensington and Chelsea Royal Borough council said no one has suffered any injuries as a result of the incident at around 2.30pm. Disaster narrowly avoided: Fortunately, the huge tree fell out into the road and not into the children's playground . Wreckage: The fallen tree left crushed at least two vehicles parked in Colville Square . Powerful: The tree appears to be very mature, measuring at least 10ft in circumference . Witness Rochelle Labarrie, who lives opposite the tree, said children and nursery staff had been in the playground at the time. 'I just heard this huge noise and thought ""what was that?""' she told MailOnline. 'My son said ""the tree has fallen down"". The next thing we could hear car alarms going off and looked out the balcony and it had crushed these cars. 'Everybody was kind of shocked and screaming ""Oh my God"". For young children that would've been very frightening. If it had fallen in there they would certainly have been seriously hurt if not dead. 'You're used to seeing these kinds of things in the Caribbean when there's been a hurricane. I've never seen anything like it.' At least two cars, a Silver Toyota Avensis and a blue Mercedes are believed to have been written off, and three other cars damaged. The branches landed perilously to some of the windows of the streets exclusive properties, where a two-bedroom flat was recently sold for £800,000. It is not known what caused the tree to fall, but large roots were visible above the ground. Community worker Ms Labarrie, 48, said she believed the tree was at least 100 years old and that residents had complained before that it appeared unstable. 'I've lived here for 30 years and we've complained about the tree before,' she said. 'When it rained or it was windy you could see it shaking. 'I believe in preserving trees but at the same time you have to make sure it's safe and secure for the community.' A council spokesman said that tree . surgeons had been called out to dispose of the tree and an investigation . is ongoing into what caused it to fall. He added that it had been trimmed in February and deemed to be alive. Damage: A blue Mercedes also looks to have been severely crushed by the tree .

"A damning internal memo claims the State Department called off an investigation into allegations that U.S. Ambassador to Belgium Howard Gutman repeatedly trawled overseas public parks in search of prostitutes, including minors. Undersecretary of State for Management Patrick Kennedy ordered the investigation closed shortly after it was opened, according to the memo, which was written by the State Department Inspector General's office. Gutman, who has not been charged with any crimes, said the allegations are 'baseless.' 'I am angered and saddened by the baseless allegations that have appeared in the press and to watch the four years I have proudly served in Belgium smeared is devastating,' Gutman, 56, told MailOnline in an e-mailed statement. 'I live on a beautiful park in Brussels that you walk through to get to many  locations and at no point have I ever engaged in any improper activity.' United States Ambassador to Belgium Howard Gutman is pictured with his wife, Michelle Loewinger, in April 2013. An internal State Department memo claims that he was investigated on allegations that he solicited prostitutes . The case against Gutman, a top Obama donor, was being investigated by the Special Investigations Division, an independent investigative arm of the Diplomatic Security Service. The investigating agent 'had . determined that the ambassador routinely ditched his protective security . detail in order to solicit sexual favors from both prostitutes and . minor children,' states the memo obtained by MailOnline. 'As the agent began to plan . surveillance on the ambassador to obtain corroboration, the agent . reportedly received notification that [Kennedy] had directed [the State Department's IG] to . cease the investigation and have the agent return to Washington.' Gutman is a top donor to President Obama, having raised a total of $775,000 for his 2008 campaign and inauguration committee, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. A native New Yorker and son of a Holocaust survivor, he has been married to his wife, Michelle Loewinger, since 1981. He is adored by Belgians, who dubbed him . in 2011 'the Ambassador who makes us love America again.' One Belgian . newspaper has even claimed that he could handily win an election if he . ran for office there. The case against Gutman is just one . in a series of supposed State Department coverups outlined in the memo, which was first reported by CBS News' John Miller. Gutman (center) is adored by Belgians, who dubbed him in 2011 'the Ambassador who makes us love America again' Secretary of State John Kerry is puctured with Gutman and his wife at their residence in Brussels, Belgium, on April 22, 2013 . The U.S. embassy in Brussels (left) sits on a 32-acre park (right) that is also the site of the Royal Palace of Brussels and the Belgian parliament . The incidents were also cited in a November 2012 draft of a report by the Office of the Inspector General on the performance of the Diplomatic Security Service. The report obtained by MailOnline stated that senior government officials were 'protecting favored [Diplomatic Security] rising stars from criminal charges or from embarrassing revelations that could harm a promising career.' July 8, 1956: Howard Gutman is born in New York, New York . 1977: Graduates Columbia University . 1980: Graduates magna cum laude from Harvard Law School . Oct. 3, 1981: Marries Michelle Phyllis Loewinger in Long Island . 1982: Joins Washington, D.C. law firm Williams & Connolly LLP . 1985: Becomes special assistant to FBI Director William H. Webster . 1988: Becomes a partner at Williams & Connolly and practices law there for the next two decades . June 2009: Nominated by President Obama to serve as ambassador to Belgium . Aug. 14, 2009: Sworn in as ambassador to Belgium . May 2011: Accused by a Diplomatic Security investigator of having 'ditched' his private security detail on a regular basis to pursue sexual favors from prostitutes and minors . 'Such interventions take place often enough that several sources in the Department who regularly see [Special Investigations Division] cases summed the situation up with almost identical words: DS should never investigate DS,' the report continued. But those sentences, as well as all . references to the investigations that were detailed in the memo, were removed from . a final draft of the report - which was issued in March 2013 - at the . request of Diplomatic Security's top brass. At a December 14, 2012 meeting, . Assistant Secretary of State for Diplomatic Security Eric Boswell . requested that the information be omitted from the final report, . according to notes from the meeting obtained by MailOnline. 'He proposed that the subject ""should . be withheld"" from the inspection report until INV's process determines . if ""there is something there,""' the meeting notes stated. 'Boswell . said putting the subject in the report would ""generally damage DS,"" would ""probably damage the Department,"" and would be used by ""every . defense lawyer around.""' In addition to the Gutman case, State Department officials also reportedly manipulated an investigation into . the 'endemic' hiring of prostitutes among agents belonging to former . Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's security detail. The memo states that seven . security agents were accused of paying for sex while traveling with Clinton . overseas. Two agents confessed to the deeds while a third 'stated he . paid for services that were ultimately not received.' An internal memo has revealed that members of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's security detail were investigated for engaging prostitutes while on official trips in foreign countries . In . one instance, State Department superiors allowed an offending agent to . continue his role in securing a Moscow hotel 'despite obvious . counterintelligence issues.' Investigators . later uncovered evidence against four more agents and concluded that . the prostitution problem within Clinton's security detail was 'endemic.' As punishment, three agents were removed from the security detail and reassigned elsewhere. But further investigation into the remaining four agents was stopped by senior officials, 'despite the possibility of counterintelligence issues,' according to the memo. The document also references an 'underground drug ring' operating near the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad may have been providing drugs to U.S. security contractors, including one who died of a methadone overdose. The memo was brought to light by Aurelia Fedenisn, a former investigator for the State Department Inspector General. She says is sharing the memo with the media to shed light on how internal investigations are influenced by the State Department. She told CBS that investigators . expect some influence but that 'the degree to which that influence . existed and how high up it went, was very disturbing.' Secretary of State John Kerry pauses during a joint news conference with Polish Foreign Minister Radoslaw Sikorski, Monday, June 3, 2013, at the State Department in Washington . State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki pushed back against the allegations in the memo during a press briefing on Monday. The 'notion that we would not vigorously pursue criminal misconduct in a case, any case, is preposterous,' she said. 'We take allegations of misconduct seriously and we investigate thoroughly. All cases mentioned in the CBS report were thoroughly investigated or under investigation.' Psaki added that the State Department has responded specifically to the Inspector General's claims that its investigations are being influenced. 'The department has responded to the recommendations in the [Inspector General's] report,' she added. 'Diplomatic Security has taken the further step of requesting additional review by outside experience law enforcement officers on top of the [Inspector General's] inspection so that officers with law enforcement experience can make expert assessments about our current procedures.'","An internal memo reveals the State Department called off an investigation into U.S. Ambassador to Belgium Howard Gutman that alleged he courted prostitutes and minors for sex .

"Presiding in a time of crisis: Met Police Commissioner Bernard Hogan-Howe is investigating accusations of misconduct by undercover officers . Scotland Yard is facing a fresh crisis over claims its most sensitive units were ‘infiltrated’ by corrupt officers in the pay of a crime boss. David Hunt, one of Britain’s leading organised criminals, is accused of bribing officers to help him evade justice. Three whistleblowers have come forward to claim the  53-year-old compromised the work of teams dealing with informants, intelligence and protected witnesses. They allege corrupt serving and former officers helped Hunt locate and intimidate a man into dropping his evidence. And it is claimed that when senior officers were alerted they launched an internal inquiry into the whistleblowers that only served to help the gangster. Last week Hunt was named by a High Court judge as a ruthless gangster implicated in a career of violence and fraud. He was exposed by a Sunday Times investigation that revealed the truth behind his façade as a scrap metal and waste dealer. Hunt brought a libel claim against the newspaper. But Mr Justice Simon at the High Court found Hunt was involved in fraud, prostitution, money laundering and ‘extreme violence’. He remains under investigation by the Serious Organised Crime Agency and HM Revenue and Customs for tax evasion. The allegations are the latest in a number of scandals to rock Scotland Yard. Commissioner Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe . has already directed that allegations officers tried to smear the family . of Stephen Lawrence are probed urgently. Sir Bernard is also dealing with the . fall out of a public inquiry which on Friday ruled a marksman acted . unlawfully when he shot dead a suspected armed robber in 2005. Smear claims:  Doreen Lawrence, the mother of Stephen Lawrence, outside New Scotland Yard with her son Stuart after meeting with Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe . Three detectives have written a 54-page letter to Sir Bernard outlining how they tried to take on Hunt before the 2012 Olympics. It names four of five officers, including a senior detective, who they claim have been working for Hunt’s crime gang. Among them is a junior detective in a sensitive role who is alleged to have taken a £35,000 bribe from Hunt in 2007. The three whistleblowers are suing the Met for failing to act on intelligence that Hunt had taken out a contract on them. Instead of being backed to pursue the . criminal, the group were themselves placed in the spotlight of a . three-year £2million internal investigation. In his judgment last week, Mr Justice . Simon labelled the inquiry ‘misdirected’ and said it ‘undoubtedly . assisted’ Hunt in escaping prosecution. A Met spokesman confirmed the force is ‘assessing’ the allegations of corruption.","Gangster David Hunt was allegedly helped by police officers to evade justice .

"This happy swimmer might need a bigger pair of trunks. Rajan the Asian elephant loves nothing more than a dip in the sea. The retired working animal is the only elephant in the world to swim in the sea, and loves to take a dip off the Andaman Islands, an archipelago that is part of India in the bay of Bengal. Scroll down for video . The Asian elephant is a retired working animal called Rajan and is the only elephant in the world to swim in the sea .

He was trained to swim to haul logs out to boats off the Islands, but when the practice was banned, enough money was raised to keep Rajan where he was in retirement. His duties have been taken up by motor boats and now he just swims for fun and allows divers to have a dip with him. Photographer Wolfgang Zwicknagl, from Austria said it was amazing what a good swimmer this huge animal is. Wolfgang, 40, said: 'We have been told that Rajan goes swimming in the sea just two or three times per month. 'He is not forced to go into the water and if he doesn't want to, then you dive alone.

'But when his Mahout brought him to the beach, he stood there for a minute, took a breath and walked into the ocean. 'It is almost impossible to explain how amazed we were when he started the dive with us. 'He moves perfectly in the ocean, using his trunk as a snorkel and moved much quicker than we expected, so taking photos was surprisingly exhausting. 'The tips of his tusks have been cut slightly as he had some difficulties moving his trunk.' Wolfgang added: 'Rajan is a retired working elephant who enjoys his pension on the Andaman Islands. 'While elephants love in a dip in the . river, Rajan is the last and only one who swims in the ocean, as the . painful education to do this is not allowed anymore. Wolfgang Zwicknagl took the pictures in the Andaman Islands, an archipelago that is part of India in the bay of Bengal . Splashing about: Despite their large frames, elephants are capable swimmers . 'Working elephants have been used at the Andamans for bringing logged trees to boats waiting in the sea and eventually to swim to the next island. This required a cruel education. The 64-year-old animal, that weighs between three and four tons, was bought into freedom approximately five years ago. He would have been sold to a temple in south India otherwise to continue his working elephant career. Wolfgang said: 'He was definitely less exhausted than us (after the dive).' Despite their large frames, elephants are capable swimmers. They have been recorded swimming for up to six hours without touching the bottom, and have travelled as far as 30 miles.

Mr Derong, from Dongzhuangtou Village in northern China, could not afford art school but after hundreds of broken eggs, he finally cracked it. Fragile: Pu Derong, from a village near Zhuozhou City in China, has taught himself to make intricate three-dimensional drawings on eggshells . Delicate: Mr Derong likes to carve traditional Chinese symbols on to the wafer-thin shell surfaces . Mr Derong needs to keep a very steady hand, as one wrong move can destroy hours of painstaking work. He uses his artistry mainly to recreate traditional Chinese symbols and animals, such as pandas, peacocks and dragons. Mr Derong, who started egg carving in 1995, has won several awards in various contests and exhibitions for his unusual skill. Remarkable: The eggshells that Mr Derong manages to turn into miniature works of art are only around 3mm thick . Painstaking: The carving requires hours of concentration with a steady hand - one false move can ruin a whole day's work . Chinese culture: Mr Derong could not afford art school but has still perfected this unusual art form . Although egg carving is more commonly done using a fine diamond bit on an electric rotary tool, he manages to create the same effect by just using a carving knife. He concentrates on carving the whole egg in one sitting, carefully following his sketched design on the shell. Because of all the calcium in the surface, luckily the incredibly time-consuming and skillful process is preserved for a long time. They have recently become expensive collectors' items.","Pu Derong has mastered the art of carving on fragile 0.3 mm eggshells .

"Gordon Leighton was found guilty of the sexual abuse of a child d . Church elders refused to comment on a child abuse scandal because they had a 'duty to God' to keep the sex attacker's confession a secret, a court heard. Jehovah Witness ministerial servant . Gordon Leighton admitted sexually abusing a child when he was confronted . with allegations before elders at his church,Newcastle Crown Court . heard. But during the official police investigation the 53-year-old, who hit the headlines in the 1990s when his wife Yvonne, 28, died after refusing a blood transfusion after childbirth on religious grounds, denied any illegal wrongdoing. When detectives asked elders Simon Preyser, Harry Logan and David Scott to make statements about the confession, all three refused and said what they had heard was confidential. The elders knew about the admissions for three years, but refused to cooperate with the criminal investigation, the court heard. The trio kept that stance when the case was brought before Newcastle Crown Court. Each was then issued with a witness summons. They then launched a court battle against the summonses but were ordered to testify by Judge Penny Moreland after months of legal wrangling. Their barrister Richard Daniels said the men had a 'duty to God' not to breach confidence. He added: 'Privileged communication between members of the congregation and  ministers is an absolute right and duty and there is no power in law to breach such a confidence.' Judge Moreland made an order that the men must reveal what they heard and said: “It is apparent that the three elders who were present when this conversation took place are in possession of relevant evidence as to a point which is of real significance in this case. 'They claim the right of confidentiality, they claim that what they heard said by the defendant during the course of that meeting ought to be subject to privilege, as ministers of religion.' Judge Moreland refused to withdraw the summonses and said: 'Public interest is clearly in favour of this evidence being given.

Despite the judge’s ruling, the men refused to make statements to police until just hours before they were called as witnesses before the jury. Leighton, who has since been expelled from the church at Lampton Kingdom Hall in Washington, Wearside, denied two charges of indecency with a child and seven of indecent assault. He was yesterday found guilty of two charges of indecency with a child and six of indecent assault. He was found not guilty of one indecent assault charge, on the direction of the judge. Judge Moreland remanded him in custody until August 23, when he will be sentenced. The judge told him: 'You know, I am sure, that the inevitable sentence is one of immediate and lengthy custody. 'You will be remanded in custody in the meantime.' Prosecutor Katherine Dunn told the court it was in 2009 the victim broke her silence about what Leighton had done to her. The court heard at a special meeting, aimed at 'keeping the congregation clean', Leighton 'admitted sexual abuse' and made excuses for his vile behaviour. Miss Dunn said: 'The elders conducted their own investigation. 'A meeting was arranged and the defendant was confronted with the allegations. 'After initially denying the allegations he broke down and admitted sexually abusing the complainant.' The court heard Leighton, from Ayton, refused to answer any questions when interviewed by detectives and claimed his confession at the meeting was limited to masturbation and reading pornographic material. Throughout the six day trial Leighton denied all allegations against him and denied he had confessed to the elders. He told jurors: 'It never happened. 'It’s all untrue.' Leighton had also denied unrelated assault charges, which he was found guilty of.

"'Problem': Former director of BBC News Helen Boaden was aware of a 'deep liberal bias' in the way the Corporation approached the topic of immigration, the report said . The BBC’s ‘deep liberal bias’ prevented it from reporting immigration properly, its former news chief has admitted. Helen Boaden told a BBC review into the impartiality of its own coverage that it failed to take anti-immigration lobby groups ‘seriously’ when she took the job in 2004, the year Britain threw open its doors to migrants from Eastern Europe. The report, published yesterday, collected a series of damning comments by current and former corporation employees who accused it of ‘collective blindness’ and ‘fundamental niceness’ over controversial topics such as race and immigration. But it concluded that the BBC produces an ‘impressive range of opinion’ overall. Critics said the report would encourage the BBC to continue to ignore concerns over bias. Tory MP Philip Davies, who sits on the culture, media and sport committee, said: ‘[Helen Boaden’s comments] confirm what most of us have known for many years. 'I don’t want the BBC just to accept this and continue on their way. 'What are they going to do to stop their liberal Left-wing culture?’ Sir Andrew Green, chairman of lobby group Migration Watch, said the review was a ‘lost opportunity’ and ‘skated over’ recent cases of corporation bias. The 65-page report, produced by former ITV boss Stuart Prebble, a self-confessed ‘liberal progressive’, was called a ‘whitewash’ by Ed West, the author of another recent investigation into BBC impartiality. 'Bias': The BBC was 'slow' to catch up with public opinion on topic including immigration and the UK's membership of the European Union, according to a new report . Former BBC News chief aware of 'deep liberal bias' in its approach to topic of immigration . Mr Prebble’s review, which cost licence . fee-payers £175,000, criticised the BBC for being ‘slow to reflect the . weight of concern in the wider community’ about immigration and the . European Union. He said the corporation gave too much . prominence to the opinions of politicians, who were hesitant to discuss . immigration issues. But he concluded the overall selection . of opinion broadcast by the BBC is ‘broad and impressive’, adding: . ‘Only the very unreasonable would argue that  the BBC is not providing a . suitable breadth of views and opinion on the subject of Europe.’ As part of his eight-month analysis, . Mr Prebble interviewed 25 senior BBC staff, including Miss Boaden, now . director of BBC radio. Public opinion: The independent review, commissioned by the BBC Trust, said the corporation was slow to reflect the weight of concern in the wider community surrounding immigration . Debate: The BBC was 'slow to give appropriate prominence' to the growing weight of opinion opposing UK membership of the EU, the report said . He said: ‘[Miss Boaden] accepts that . when she came into her role in September 2004 there had been a problem . in the BBC’s coverage of immigration. She was aware, she told us, of a “deep . liberal bias” in the way that the BBC approached the topic, and . specifically that press releases coming from Migration Watch were not . always taken as seriously as they might have been.’ BBC presenter Steve Hewlett accused . the corporation of a ‘general corporate sensitivity’ and a ‘collective . blindness’ over race and immigration. Former Today programme journalist . Robin Aitken added: ‘What damages the BBC on a subject like immigration . is fundamental niceness and being loath to give offence to any part of . the community. ‘It is a self-censoring idea: “Let’s . not encourage debate as it might encourage nasty elements in society.” It is entirely wrong-headed.’ However, Mr Prebble refused to express . an opinion on whether the BBC was guilty of liberal bias. He added: . ‘There is no genuine argument that the presence of one type of . programming is squeezing out the opportunity to hear an alternative . point of view.’ He even suggested viewers and listeners should ‘read a book’ if they were unhappy with the BBC. A BBC spokesman said: ‘We are pleased our coverage has been deemed “remarkable” and “impressive”.’ A well-known figure in London media circles, 62-year-old Stuart Prebble was ITV’s chief executive until 2002 when he resigned after the collapse of ITV Digital.He set up the independent programme maker Liberty Bell and his many BBC credits include BBC2 series Grumpy Old Men and, in 2007, a three-part series based on the diaries of former Labour spin doctor Alistair Campbell. He began his career as a BBC graduate trainee journalist and last year he revealed: ‘I have a long-term affection for the BBC. It’s important for all of us in broadcasting.’ Yesterday Mr Prebble, who now heads StoryVault Films, insisted he is not currently working on any BBC projects. Defending his appointment, BBC Trust member David Liddiment said: ‘Stuart has been very open about his [liberal] perspective. He was a very good person to do this report.’ The review of BBC current affairs likened Newsnight host Jeremy Paxman to a brutal boxer. It highlighted an episode of Newsnight where Paxman clashed with Respect MP George Galloway. Author Stuart Prebble said: ‘When George Galloway squared up to Jeremy Paxman after Galloway won the Bradford West by-election, Paxman started raining blows on him from the starting bell, to an extent that I was surprised to find my sympathies going towards the challenger.’ He also said that interviews on Radio 4’s Today, for example by John Humphrys, could be like a fairground prize-fighter taking on an amateur. ‘The result can be excruciatingly entertaining to witness, and no one doubts that both sides need properly to be tested, but it is not always a fair display of the merits of each fighter,’ he said.","BBC 'slow' to catch up with public opinion on immigration, report says .

"Whether or not Kate Middleton is officially overdue is subject to much speculation, but one thing is for sure: reporters covering the royal birth are overdue some sleep. Some royal correspondents, including NBC anchor Natalie Morales, have been camped out in front of the Duchess . of Cambridge's hospital of choice, St Mary's, for days and even weeks with very . little news to dine out on.

As the world waits with bated breath, U.S. reporters in London to cover the big story are, well, more bored than anything else. Kate’s due date was widely reported as being last Saturday, July 13, and the . world's press has been  stationed outside the Lindo Wing of St Mary's . Hospital in London ever since to ensure they don't miss the . new arrival. But the only confirmation from Kate has . been that she was due in ‘mid-July’. Since babies can are most often born within a week either side of the 40-week mark, It could days yet before the baby comes. All this brings no comfort to the the media in limbo outside the Lindo. 'Have this baby already, Kate, please?' implored Morales on NBC's Today on Friday, though she didn't look too miserable as she partook of fish and chips and a . pint of bitter from her chair outside the hospital. “There are people everywhere. I don’t know what they are doing, but (they’re here) all the time, anytime — morning and night,” Lea Fortunato, a researcher at Imperial College London’s Faculty of Medicine, next door to the hospital told the National Post. She said that reporters are there when she arrives for work and there when she leaves. 'They started camping last week. I didn’t think they would camp!' said Million Moyo, a deputy manager in the emergency ward of St Mary’s. 'Most people [at the hospital] are really intrigued.” Inside the metal barricades enclosing the world's media to keep them off the roads, members of the press are starting to go a little stir-crazy. Last week, a camera operator from NBC set up a betting pool based on the baby's sex, the day the baby will arrive and what time. Not satisfied with that small entertainment, he attached bright neon 'for sale' tags to the ladders left behind by photographers the night before. 'Post Partum Ladder Sale,' read one tag. “Will Swap for a Mars Bar,' read another, reported the National Post. Idle hands: One bored cameraman has been keeping himself busy .

Meanwhile, Kate, . 31, stayed at the home of her parents Carole and Michael Middleton in . Berkshire last weekend, while William played in two long-standing . charity polo matches. Adding to the rumors, tip-offs and fevered speculation, the Duchess of Cornwall dropped a . tantalizing hint on Monday that the wait could soon be over, telling . well-wishers she expects the little boy or girl to arrive imminently. Camilla revealed during a visit to a . children's hospice near St Austell, Cornwall: 'We are all just waiting . by the telephone. We are hopeful that by the end of the week he or she . will be here.' However, last Wednesday the Queen appeared to suggest that the baby was already late. She told a 10-year-old schoolgirl on a trip to Cumbria: 'I would very much like it to arrive because I’m going on holiday . soon... I wish it would hurry up.' Outside the hospital are scores of people, not just media, who are anxiously awaiting for the royal arrival.

"Last Picture: Stephen Rakes looks over his shoulder as he leaves the courthouse after attending the trial . The funeral has been scheduled for the man who was found dead just days after being relieved as a witness from the Whitey Bulger trial. Police are still investigating the death of Stephen 'Stippo' Rakes, who was found dead on a remote running path on Wednesday. Rakes openly despised Bulger, the former crime boss who headed Boston's notorious Winter Hill Gang, and was ready to testify that Bulger threatened his daughter at gunpoint to force him to turn over his South Boston liquor store for $100,000 so that he could make it his mob's new headquarters. After Rakes' body was found by a jogger, police initially ruled it a suicide but now they have revealed that an autopsy has been rulled inconclusive in determining what killed him. Investigators have ordered toxicology tests, which can take weeks to be processed. In the meantime, The Boston Herald reports that his friends and relatives will attend his wake on Wednesday and funeral at the Gate of Heaven Church in South Boston on Thursday morning. His friend Steven Davis told NBC: 'No car, no automobile, no ID. Steve carried his ID right here all the time in his pocket. 'Of course I think (he was murdered). Because of how everything falls into play here now.' Steven Davis told NBC: 'No car, no automobile, no ID. Steve carried his ID right here all the time in his pocket. Of course I think (he was murdered). Because of how everything falls into play here now' A long time friend of Rakes, Steve Davis, whose sister Debbie was allegedly killed by Bulger, said the first indication of anything amiss with Rakes was on Wednesday afternoon when he was removed from the witness list of U.S. Attorney Carmen Ortiz at the U.S. District Court in South Boston. James 'Whitey' Bulger: He was one of the nation's most wanted fugitives after he fled Boston in 1994. He was finally captured two years ago in Santa Monica, California and faces 32 counts, including 19 murder charges . The 59-year-old's death came just weeks after Rake, 59, revealed he was no longer scared of the gangster and that he was grateful to be alive to testify. 'They took everything from me,' he said of the mob. 'They don't care about nothing. They don't care about what they take from you... At least I’m still alive. I’m alive and I’m grateful for that.' Rakes, who had previously refused to testify against Bulger, had told Davis that he was 'nervous' about the 'bombshell' he thought he was going to drop on the stand at the feared mobster's trial. 'He was looking forward to taking the stand. He told me over and over he had a big bombshell to drop,' said Davis. However, . he was robbed of this chance on Tuesday when U.S. Attorney Carmen Ortiz . informed Rakes that he was no longer needed as a witness - a decision . that reportedly 'devastated' him. Rakes . had harbored decades of anger at Bulger and his accomplices, Stephen . 'The Rifleman' Flemmi and Kevin Weeks, after they allegedly forced him . to hand over his South Boston liquor store in 1984 by holding a gun to . his daughter's head. 'The day I see him in a box, not breathing, will be better,' Rakes said in April. Scene: Lincoln Police guard the side of the road where Stephen Rakes was found dead on Wednesday 17 July . Secluded: This is Mill St in Lincoln, Massachusetts, where Stephen 'Stippo' Rakes was discovered dead . Indeed, Rakes had been a constant presence at Bulger's trial at the US District Court in South Boston. Attending . every day for the past six weeks, the trial began after the notorious . gangster was captured in California two years ago after 16 years on the . run from authorities. Bulger's right-hand man, Kevin Weeks . testified last week Rakes' expected upcoming testimony that Bulger's . gang put a gun to his daughter's head was . bogus. Weeks, who was a close associate of . Bulger's for two decades, later became a government witness and . eventually led authorities to the bodies of people who were allegedly . killed by Bulger and the gang. He served five years in prison after pleading guilty to being an accessory to five murders. Testimony: Stephen Rakes smiles after greeting an acquaintance outside the liquor store he once owned in the South Boston neighborhood of Boston, Thursday, June 6th, 2013 . Bulger stared straight ahead during much of Weeks' testimony and only glanced at him occasionally.Weeks also described how Bulger acquired a liquor store in South Boston. Prosecutors . say Bulger forced Stephen Rakes to sell his liquor store to him in 1984 . to use as a headquarters for his gang and as a source of ‘legitimate’ income. Weeks denied that . the gang forced Rakes to sell the store, saying Rakes had agreed with an . offer from Bulger to buy the store for $100,000 . He said when they arrived at Rakes' house to close the deal, Rakes said his wife didn't want to sell the . store and complained about the selling price. ‘He was trying to shake us down,’ Weeks said. At the time, Rakes' two young daughters were in the room and Bulger was bouncing one of the girls on his lap, Weeks said. He . said he pulled a gun out of his waistband and put it on the table. The . girl on Bulger's lap reached for the gun, Weeks said. Bulger then told . him to put it away. Surveillance shot: This undated surveillance photo released Monday, July 8, 2013 by the U.S. Attorney's office at federal court in Boston shows James 'Whitey' Bulger, left, with his former right hand man, Kevin Weeks . Changing sides: Weeks, right, who was a close associate of Bulger's for two decades, later became a government witness and eventually led authorities to the bodies of people who were allegedly killed by Bulger and the gang . ‘Kevin continues to lie, as usual, because that's what he has to do,’ Rakes said. ‘My liquor store was never for sale - never, never, never.’ Davis . told ABC News that the last time he saw Rakes was on Tuesday in court . but he failed to reach him during the night and alarms bells started . ringing when he didn't meet him for breakfast on Wednesday. 'Stippo would not kill himself. Absolutely not,' said Davis to ABC News on Thursday morning. Davis said that his friend was 'in good shape' and the two of them would frequently cycle across Boston. 'He had everything to live for and was looking forward to his day in court. It doesn't make sense.'","Stephen Rakes, 59, was discovered dead with no sign of trauma on Wednesday on a secluded rural road in Lincoln, Massachusetts .

"Ryanair has ordered its pilots to fly more slowly in a bid to save money on fuel after a fall in the airline's quarterly profit. Another money-making ruse from boss Michael O'Leary will see the firm's planes turned into flying billboards with adverts painted on the outside. The airline has warned that revenues are set to fall further after the heatwave across Europe deterred people from booking holidays online. Slow down! Ryanair has added two minutes to every hour of flight in a bid to save on fuel costs . Slowing down Ryanair planes below 600mph adds two minutes to the average hour of flying, but has reduced the company's fuel bill by 15 per cent - and executives insist it will have no effect on flight safety. The no-frills airline, famous as much for its revenue-boosting hidden charges as its publicity stunts, will also offer businesses the chance to advertise on its fleet of 303 Boeing 737-800s. Firms will be able to place their . adverts for 12 months at a time on the plane’s inner and outer winglets, . or on its front and rear fuselage, where plane-spotters and airport . users can see them. A Ryanair spokesman said businesses were . getting the chance to use ‘Europe’s largest – and cheapest – outdoor . advertising medium’. Ryanair blamed a six per cent surge in fuel costs and the early Easter for a 21 per cent decline in first-quarter profit to £67million before tax. The fall, which Ryanair said was in line with its guidance to the market, came despite a three per cent increase in passenger numbers to 23.2million and a five per cent rise in revenue to £1.16billion. The company also revealed worries that its performance had dipped in recent weeks as the hot weather drew people outside and stopped them surfing the internet for holiday deals. Outspoken: The company's controversial boss Michael O'Leary is known for his bold publicity stunts . Passengers due to travel on a flight which was cancelled were shocked to be told by easyJet that they would have to wait 86 years for a replacement. Customers of the budget airline who were flying from Geneva airport received an email from the company informing them that their flight had been delayed, according to the Independent. The message said: 'We are writing to inform you that your flight will depart at 11.00 local time on 29/07/2099.' EasyJet apologised for the 'significant inconvenience', and asked passengers to 'give us another chance in the future'. A spokesman for the airline admitted that the blunder was due to a 'systems error' - luckily for the company, as feeding and housing the passengers for 86 years would have cost £6million each. Ancillary revenue, the industry term for . any income that doesn’t come from selling seats, was up by 25 per cent . to £308million, helped by a boost from extra charges for allocated . seating and priority boarding, as well as higher credit card fees. The decision to allow passengers to reserve a seat for a higher price echoes rival easyJet, where the extra option has also proved a success. Ryanair has been locked in a dispute with the Competition Commission, which wants it to sell off a 29.8 per cent stake in compatriot airline Aer Lingus. It said the Commission had lost ‘any shred of credibility’, after Ryanair put the stake up for sale but received no offers. The Commission had cited a fear that Ryanair’s stake was deterring other investors from piling in, but O’Leary said the lack of interested parties showed their claim was unfounded. Ryanair branded the Commission ‘absurd’ and ‘draconian’ and said it expected to appeal against an anticipated order to sell the stake.","Two minutes added to every hour of flying cutting fuel costs by 15% .

"Anthony Weiner has admitted that he started three different virtual relationships with women after he resigned from Congress following his Twitter sexting scandal in 2011. Meanwhile, the woman who released the latest slew of explicit sex messages and naked pictures has said that she was truly in love with the disgraced former Congressman during their six-month virtual affair. Sydney Leathers, now 23, spoke out for the first time since her identity was revealed that she believed the feelings to be mutual, but now she is 'disgusted by him'. A preview of her interview with Inside Edition was released shortly after Weiner held a press conference on Thursday afternoon where he disclosed an approximate break down of his sexting timeline, just hours after the latest poll revealed he has lost his front-runner lead in the New York City mayoral race. New York Magazine reports . that at a press conference on Thursday, Weiner said 'it's six to ten . (women) I suppose' as the total number of women he has had virtual . relationships with in his lifetime. Scroll down for video . Coming clean: Anthony Weiner, seen here at a food center on Thursday, said that he sexted with a total of 'six to ten' women, both before and after his resignation from Congress . Dirty details: Women that he had virtual relationships with included Lisa Weiss (left) before his resignation, and Sydney Leathers (right) after . When . asked to clarify how many of those relationships started after he . resigned from Congress in June 2011, he said: 'I don't believe more than . three'. Today has not been good in terms of any . numbers for Weiner, as the first poll since the Leathers revelation . shows that he has been bumped out of the lead in the mayoral race. In love: Sydney Leathers said that she was in love with Weiner, and that he told her that he loved her as well . During the Inside Edition interview, Leathers told how she was initially attracted to Weiner because of his politics but now she has seen another side of him. 'He's not who I thought he was,' she said. She said that both she and Weiner said that they loved each other during their virtual romance, and Indiana-based Leathers has previously said that he offered to secure a condo for her in Chicago so that they could meet for trysts beyond the computer screen. When asked what she would like to say to him now, she responded: 'Stop lying, stop embarrassing his wife, and get help.' The renewed discussion about his sexual indiscretions was prompted by Leather's decision to release screen grabs of their conversations to gossip site The Dirty as well as pictures of his genitals, all of which were exchanged more than one year after he resigned from Congress. His drop in the polls comes as Weiner confirmed he had virtual relationships with three women after his 2011 resignation from Congress and between six and ten similar situations prior to leaving office. The first poll conducted after his relationship with then-22-year-old Sydney Leather was revealed just came out Thursday afternoon and has City Council Speaker Christine Quinn leading with 25 per cent of the Democratic vote. Weiner comes in second place with only 16 per cent- down from his earlier 26 per cent lead from a different poll that measured the public's thinking the week preceding the Tuesday revelations. 'These new revelations have cost Anthony Weiner the lead in the Democratic field,' director of Marist College polling Lee Miringoff told The Wall Street Journal, which co-sponsored the poll. Carrying on: Anthony Weiner, seen here campaigning on Thursday, asserts that he will continue with his bid to become New York City's next mayor in spite of the latest scandal and his plummeting poll numbers . Competitors: The latest poll, conducted post scandal, says that Weiner is in second place and followed by the city's former comptroller Bill Thompson . In addition to taking away his lead, . the release of naked photos and explicit sex chats have driven up his . unfavorability rating, bringing him up to an 'all-time high' of 55 per . cent. By comparison, his unfavorables were only at 36 per cent in June. This . latest survey took place entirely on Wednesday, the day after the . former Obama campaign worker shared her illicit sex chats and photos of . Weiner's genitals with gossip site The Dirty. New frontrunner: City Council speaker Christine Quinn (seen with Weiner behind her at a sleep out on Wednesday night to highlight housing issues in the city) leads with 25 per cent of the Democratic vote . Later . that same day, the disgraced congressman and his wife Huma Abedin held a . joint press conference declaring their dedication to both one another . and the campaign. The Wall Street Journal/Marist poll suggests that there is a good number of New Yorkers who agree with that decision. Of . the 1,199 people surveyed, 47 per cent of registered Democrats said he . should stay in the race- which is the same number who believe he . deserves a second chance. That . percentage of the electorate is just slightly bigger than the 43 per . cent who said he should drop out. And 45 per cent of New York Democrats . believe he does not have the character to be mayor of the country's . largest city. Prior to this afternoon's poll, things were still looking positive for Weiner. The latest poll Quinnipiac University poll reveals that . during the week leading up to the Sydney Leather scandal, Weiner came . out on top with 26 per cent of the Democratic vote, with City Council . Speaker Christine Quinn following with 22 per cent and former . comptroller Bill Thompson with 20 per cent. The . poll may not carry the same weight now, however, as it weighed the . opinions of voters between July 18 and July 23, and Weiner's messages to . Sydney Leather were only made public on the 23rd. Weiner sent an email to supporters on Wednesday, just hours after he and his wife Huma Abedin gave a joint press conference about the messages and photos, where he said that the bid for New York City's mayor was 'too important' to give up over 'embarrassing personal things'. Problems: New York mayoral candidate Anthony Weiner said he resorted to sexting strangers during a 'rough patch' in his marriage with wife Huma Abedin (right) Moving past it: Sydney Leathers (right) is believed to be the woman who sexted with Anthony Weiner (pictured on the campaign trail in New York City) Trying to move the cycle: Weiner maintained that he will continue with his bid to become New York's next mayor . Rivals, newspaper editorial pages and . former New York congressional colleagues urged the Democrat to quit . after he acknowledged exchanging raunchy messages and photos online . after he had resigned from Congress for similar behaviour. Jerrold Nadler, Democratic . representative for New York's 10th congressional district, said: 'I . think he should pull out of the race. I think he needs serious . psychiatric help.' Nydia Velázquez, who was also Weiner's colleague back when he was a Democratic representative for the city, said his antics were a 'total distraction' from the real issues the mayoral campaign should be debating. The latest scandal erupted on Tuesday . after the gossip website The Dirty posted X-rated messages and a crotch . shot it said Weiner exchanged with a woman last year while using the . online alias 'Carlos Danger'. The New York Times cited his 'marital troubles and personal compulsions' as reasons for the 48-year-old Democrat to leave the race while The Wall Street Journal claimed he should be forced out 'simply because of what he's forced his wife to endure'. 'I love him. I have forgiven him. I believe in him': Huma Abedin read a statement at the Tuesday press conference reaffirming her belief in her husband and their marriage . Standing united: Anthony Weiner had his wife Huma Abedin at his side when he addressed the new revelations of another sexually inappropriate relationship that took place a year after he resigned . 'The serially evasive Mr. Weiner . should take his marital troubles and personal compulsions out of the . public eye and the mayoral race,' the Times wrote. The Daily News declared Weiner to be . 'lacking the dignity and discipline that New York deserves in a mayor,"" and said ""his demons have no place in City Hall.' At least three of his mayoral rivals, . Bill de Blasio and Sal Albanese, both Democrats, and billionaire . businessman John Catsimatidis, a Republican, said he should drop out. 'Anthony's presence in this race has . become a never-ending sideshow that is distracting us from the debate of . the serious issues of this election,' de Blasio said. Weiner's strongest rivals in the polls, Christine Quinn and Bill Thompson, criticised him but didn't directly call on him to quit.","Weiner came in second place in latest poll conducted after the latest sex chat messages were revealed .

"Health risk: Pensioners have been warned to drink less alcohol or risk damaging their health . Pensioners were warned last night to drink less alcohol or risk severely damaging their health. Doctors and public health experts said heavy drinking among the elderly was a ‘hidden problem’ and safe limit guidelines for over-65s should be halved. They warned that older people were unaware of the health risks and that their bodies were less able to cope. They said metabolism was slower in the elderly, meaning the toxic chemicals linger longer in the body, while drunkenness can raise the odds of depression and mask the development of dementia. Alcohol-related falls can lead to years of disability, while drinks can interfere with prescription pills, with dangerous effects. Retirement, bereavement and loneliness can all increase the thirst for alcohol, which can trigger problems from dementia to disabling falls and liver damage. Andrew Langford, of the British Liver Trust, said: ‘The drinking patterns of the over-65s have changed, particularly in women. 'The idea of an older woman with a glass of sherry is way out of date. It is more likely to be a bottle of wine a day.’ He added that because much of the drinking done by over-65s happened at home, it was largely a hidden problem. Emily Robinson, of Alcohol Concern, said: ‘It’s time we stopped thinking that alcohol is just a problem for binge-drinking youngsters. 'Unless we start taking this seriously and acknowledge the health problems too much alcohol can cause, the situation will only get worse.’ Newcastle University researchers want  a new recommended drinking limit for over-65s and special advice on alcohol, tailored to the needs of older people. Hidden dangers: Doctors want the daily recommended alcoholic intake limit lowered to 1.5 units a day for men and one unit for women . Slower metabolism: Elderly people's bodies are not as able to cope with alcohol as well as younger people . The call comes as the Department of Health reviews alcohol guidelines for all age groups and follows a recommendation from psychiatrists that existing limits should be halved. The Royal College of Psychiatrists wants men over 65 to be limited to 1.5 units a day and women to one unit. The current advice is that men stop at three to four units a day and women limit themselves to two to three. ‘Many older people are drinking to a . level that is having a long-term impact on their health, even if the . damage they are doing is not always apparent.’ Dr Graeme Wilson, Newcastle University . Half a pint of ordinary-strength beer counts as one unit. A large glass of wine contains three units. NHS statistics show that over-65s are more likely to drink than young people. And they are also more likely than any other group to drink every day of the week. Alcohol-related admissions to hospital for everything from liver disease to dementia caused by brain cells being killed off by booze has soared by 150 per cent in those aged between 60 and 74 in the past decade. Dr Graeme Wilson, of Newcastle University, said: ‘Many older people are drinking to a level that is having a long-term impact on their health, even if the damage they are doing is not always apparent.’ The researchers told the journal PLoS ONE that while the elderly may believe they have built up a tolerance to booze, alcohol can cause more damage to the ageing body. Dr Wilson’s team quizzed older people about their attitude to alcohol. Many were ‘very blasé’ about the dangers, with some saying they had drunk for many years without their health being harmed. One woman who drank a bottle of wine a day said she didn’t have a problem because she had never ‘been found drunk in a corner’. Others said being given a free bus pass meant they could drink more, while some drank to relieve the pain of osteoporosis. Katie Haighton, one of the study’s authors, said GPs were loath to intervene, with many not wanting to deprive patients of enjoyment later on in life. She added: ‘A lot of those we interviewed said the messages around alcohol were very confusing. 'There is a need to develop new approaches to target the older population.’ Age UK, which funded the Newcastle University study, said that although the spotlight usually fell on young people, the biggest increases in alcohol-related illnesses were in the elderly. The Department of Health said that as well as reviewing the guidelines, it had introduced alcohol risk assessments at GPs’ surgeries.","Doctors warn that heavy drinking among the elderly is a 'hidden problem'

"Incredibly loyal:  Lefty the pit bull saved her owner's life when she launched herself at a gun fired by an intruder . A pet dog has lost its leg but saved its owner's life after leaping in front of a gun fired by an armed intruder. 'Lefty' the pit bull interrupted four men who had broken into a family home, in Accomack County, Virginia, U.S., where the parents and children were sleeping. One of the robbers pointed a firearm at the father but the small but fearless pet launched herself at it. Putting herself between the muzzle of the gun and the owner, Lefty took a direct hit. The shot shattered her right shoulder and blew away the muscle on her leg. Bleeding heavily and in shock, Lefty was rushed to the nearby veterinary centre. Surgeons got to work almost immediately, but were unable to save her leg, so they decided to amputate. While Lefty had saved her family's . life, they were now left unable to pay the bill for her operation and so . the vets posted a plea for help on their Facebook page. Alongside a picture of the adorable pet dog they explained her remarkable story. 'The outpouring of compassion and support for this sweet girl has been outstanding,' the veterinary centre said on its Facebook page . Within a matter of days, Facebook friends of the Atlantic Animal Hospital, Accomack, had donated enough funds to help cover the costs. And today, Lefty is adapting well to her new life as a three-legged dog. The . practice posts regular updates on her progress including a video of her . only a day after the procedure, getting to grips with her new way of . walking. The remarkable story of Lefty saving her owners' lives has received so much support and attention that the practice posts regular updates on her condition . A recent update says: 'Lefty is doing amazingly well! The outpouring of compassion and support for this sweet girl has been outstanding.' It goes on to say: 'Today she is trotting around like she's been a 3-legged dog her entire life! She is eating very well, is in great spirits and will be heading home in the very near future.' 'I saved my family member’s lives on Monday night and now I need your help!! Before the op: A photo of brae Lefty shortly before surgeons had to remove her front right leg, was used to plea for help to find the procedure . 'In the middle of the night, 4 intruders entered my family home while my parents and the children were sleeping. They tried to shoot at my Dad - but I jumped in the way and the shotgun blast hit me instead.' This is Lefty’s scary story – and it really happened right here on the Shore. She arrived at Atlantic Animal Hospital in shock and bleeding from a huge wound in her shoulder which tore up her muscles and shattered her humerus bone. She is doing very well after emergency treatment but since her family was robbed, they have no way to pay for all of her care, including the surgery she needs on her shoulder. If you can help her and her family pay for some of her surgery expenses, they would be so grateful. They want to get her home as soon as possible because the children are very afraid without her. If you can help in any way, please contact Atlantic Animal Hospital to make a donation to the Lefty fund.","Lefty the pit bull was shot by an intruder when she launched herself at a gun that was pointed at her owner .

Eileen Weston, 68, puts the food in a bird house in her back garden and throws whole slices on her garage roof. She splashes out £20-a-week on bread and margarine for the animals and even gives them scones and sausage rolls. Feed the birds: Eilleen Weston leaves two loaves of bread out for the seagulls every day . The twice-daily feed sees hundreds of seagulls, starlings, blue tits and sparrows flocking to her garden in a small residential street. But her neighbours say the food brings in flocks of birds which splatter homes, cars and people with droppings. Residents in Gloucester say they can’t even put their washing out for fear of birdstrikes, . They have repeatedly asked Eileen to stop feeding the birds and the local council say they could issue her with an Asbo. Eileen splashes out £20-a-week on bread and margarine for the animals as well as giving them scones . and sausage rolls . Under fire: Despite feeding the birds Eileen has annoyed her neighbours by leaving food out . Hungry: Seagulls perch on top of houses along the street where Eileen and her angry neighbours live . But defiant Eileen said: 'Nothing will stop me feeding the birds. I love them. It makes me happy to see them. 'They are always saying on the telly how we need to feed the birds so I feed them twice a day, once in the morning and once in the afternoon. Furious: Pam Cooke has asked her neighbour to stop leaving out food for seagulls . 'It is not my fault that the birds make a mess sometimes. I’m not in control of bird poo. 'All my neighbours needed to do was knock on my door and ask me to stop feeding the seagulls. 'I wouldn’t stop, but it’s not nice to have people talking about you behind your back.' Neighbour Pam Cooke, 65, said: 'She throws whole slices of bread on the roof of her garage, and that’s when all the gulls come. 'It’s an absolute nightmare - every other day we’re getting carpet-bombed with bird poo. 'Despite polite requests she still feeds the gulls. Our washing, vehicles and houses are bombarded with disgusting mess from these birds. 'She is acting in a very antisocial manner, seagulls are unhygienic filthy animals. I don’t mind that she feeds the little birds - we quite often put worms or corn out for them. 'It looks like something out of Hitchcock’s The Birds. Even the window cleaner complains about the poo. 'Perhaps she could be given an Asbo to encourage her to stop feeding them, I know it has been done in the past.' Mrs Cooke's husband Edward said: 'I no sooner wash my car and it is filthy again. I went around there to ask her to stop but she doesn’t seem to take any notice.' Project Solace, the squad that tackles antisocial behaviour in Gloucester, said they could take action. Evidence: Photograph showing the mess seagulls have left on Pam Cooke's windows . At war: Pam Cooke (left) is angry Eileen Weston keeps feeding seagulls two loaves of bread a day . A spokeswoman said: 'If a person has been asked to stop feeding the birds and they keep on going then we could carry out a joint operation with Environmental Health.' A Gloucester City Council spokeswoman added: 'People are entitled to feed the birds in their own garden but if there is an accumulation of waste or vermin is being attracted the council may investigate.'

"Connoisseur: William Hague chose £150 and £200 wines to serve at an event for the Queen's Diamond Jubilee . He once boasted he could drink 14 pints of beer in a day, but William Hague’s tastes have become more refined since he gained high office. The Mail on Sunday has discovered that the Foreign Secretary takes time off from the world stage to personally select fine wines  - some worth £200 a bottle - for official functions. Meanwhile Ministers, officials and guests downed more than 3,900 bottles of wines and spirits in the space of only nine months last year. The Whitehall booze bill, paid for . with public funds, includes four bottles of Paul Jaboulet Aine . Hermitage, normally £450 each, and two bottles of ‘a luscious and . harmonious’ Bordeaux worth £320 each. The . disclosure that Mr Hague acts as the Government’s unofficial sommelier . has been criticised by opponents who say that such lavish expenditure . is at odds with the Coalition’s austerity agenda. Last . night Labour MP Simon Danczuk said: ‘I’m astonished and appalled that . the Foreign Secretary would take time out of dealing with the crisis in . Syria to personally select expensive bottles of wine for functions. 'Hasn’t he got more pressing matters to deal with? 'And when the government is constantly repeating the mantra that “we’re all in it together” it smacks of hypocrisy that ministers are quaffing expensive bottles of wine while ordinary people are struggling.’ The Foreign Office, which has overall responsibility for the Government’s wine cellar, released the list when The Mail on Sunday complained to the Information Commissioner after a Freedom of Information request led to a nine-month battle. Mr Hague personally intervened to select the wine at an event celebrating the Queen’s Diamond Jubilee on June 5 last year – as he struggled with the crisis in Syria. The event was attended by the heads of Commonwealth states and senior members of the diplomatic corps. On May 28, Mr Hague’s private secretary told Robert Alexander, head of Government hospitality: ‘The Foreign Secretary thought that the wine list looked good. 'For red, he suggested either Chateau Cos D’Estournel 1990, or the Chateau Leoville- Poyferre 1990, not/not [sic] the Chateau Margaux 1983.’ The two wines chosen by Mr Hague cost £150 and £200 respectively and are rated ‘A’ in the Government’s 61-page ‘stock report’, which details all the alcoholic beverages available for functions. The bill could have been a lot higher had the Foreign Secretary not rejected the Chateau Margaux 1983, which is priced at about £400 a bottle. Mr Hague’s office was responding to an email from Mr Alexander, in which he wrote: ‘Sorry to bother you. I know the SofS [Secretary of State] is travelling today and just wondered if there is any feed-back on the suggested wines? ‘I cannot remember if I had told you that we have re-jigged the French/English balance slightly: Champagne pre-lunch, English white, Claret, and now vintage English Sparkling (Nyetimber 2005) for dessert/toast. I have assumed FS [Foreign Secretary] will not want port or cognac offered.’ Government hospitality: Chairman of the All-Party Parliamentary Wine and Spirit Group said: 'These are very top dignitaries that we are entertaining'. Robert Alexander, head of the Government's wine cellar inspects their stock in this picutre . He added: ‘We need to go to print on the menu soon.’ The . list, titled Cellar Wines And Spirits Consumption April 2012 To . December 2012, includes 184 bottles of champagne, costing up to £200 a . bottle, and 343 bottles of English sparkling wine, including Nyetimber . Classic Cuvee 2005 which costs £30 a bottle. It also shows that in June alone, Whitehall officials and their guests consumed £11,750 worth of the Chateau Cos D’Estournel 1990, one of the tipples chosen by Mr Hague. Geoffrey Clifton-Brown MP, chairman of the All-Party Parliamentary Wine and Spirit Group, said: ‘These are very top dignitaries that we are entertaining, prime ministers, presidents and foreign ministers from all over the world.’ The MP, who said he spends only £5 on wine for himself, added: ‘We need to serve them a reasonable quality, but of course there does need to be a balance.’ A Foreign Office spokesman last night was unable to clarify at what function guests drank the £450  bottles of wine. She added: ‘The Government Hospitality Wine Cellar is now self-financing. 'The Foreign Secretary and Ministers are occasionally consulted on options for wines for Government events, as they are on all the planning details.’","Whitehall drinks 4,000 bottles of booze worth up to £450 each in 9 months .

"For sale: Crumbling castle with commanding views of Lake Winnipesaukee and the threat of a wrecking ball in its near future. Kimball Castle in Gilford, New Hampshire, U.S. - built by a wealthy railroad baron - is a shell of its former self and now up for sale for $799,000. Once stunning in its grandeur and featured on postcards, the castle has long been neglected and is deemed by town officials to be 'an unattractive nuisance' and an 'extreme hazard'. Scroll down for video . Under threat: Kimball Castle, built in the late 1890s for Benjamin Ames Kimball, who was president of the Boston-Montreal Railroad, is under the threat of a wrecking ball in its near future . The dilapidated manor has fallen into such a state that it even featured on an episode of U.S. 'Ghost Hunters' a few years ago. The Gilford Board of Selectmen earlier this year approved demolition by its owner - Kimball Castle Properties LLC. The property is bound by a number of restrictive covenants that make prospects of finding a buyer bleak. Town Administrator Scott Dunn said the only thing a buyer could do with it is construct a 40-room inn and 75-seat restaurant - based on conditions attached to another prospective development plan from 1996. That plan failed to attract enough financial backing to go forward. 'Anything else would take agreement by the Attorney General, the selectmen and the court,' Dunn said. Backdrop: Commanding stunning views of Lake Winnipesaukee, the 19th century castle has been left to rot and ruin and has lost most of its windows and frames . The medieval-styled castle was built . in the late 1890s by Benjamin Ames Kimball, who was president of the . Boston, Montreal and Concord railways and had also served as president . of several Concord banks. He designed the two-story granite edifice . after castles he'd seen on Germany's Rhine River. Much . of the stone was quarried from Locke's Hill, atop which the castle sits . on 20 acres. Until his death in 1920 at age 86, Kimball liked to sit on . his stone deck gazing down upon the wide section of Lake Winnipesaukee . known as 'the broads'. No . Kimball has lived in the castle since Benjamin Kimball's daughter-in-law . died in 1960. She left the estate and about $400,000 to a charitable . foundation, with the stipulation it create a nature preserve on the site . and that the property not be used for commercial development. Halcyon days: Until his death in 1920 at age 86, Kimball liked to sit on his stone deck gazing down upon the wide section of Lake Winnipesaukee known as 'the broads' The preserve was never created, the money vanished and, in 1981, New Hampshire's Attorney General took control of the land and offered it to the town of Gilford to create the preserve and save the castle. By then, scarred and stripped of much . of its woodwork by vandals, the castle was already badly deteriorated. Trespassers had left doors and windows open. The atrium skylight was . destroyed and water had been pouring into the structure for years. In . 1980, then-town administrator Steve McCabe predicted, ""It's going to be . the wrecking ball for the castle"" unless someone steps in to save it. No one did. Gilford . residents did not want to spend the money to reverse the castle's . decay. Town administrators convinced the Attorney General's office that . the only way to save the castle was to permit commercial development. The principle investors in the 1996 project — David and Mary Jodoin — . are the sole partners in the Kimball Castle Properties LLC. The property was listed for sale in 2010 for the dearer price of $995,000 but it seems the owners will now accept a lower offer since it is scheduled to be demolished . They not only received approval to raze the castle, but were ordered to by the town's building inspector, David Andrade. The deadline was May 15, but the Jodoins have been granted two extensions — and now have until Oct. 15 — to demolish the castle and several buildings. 'Although it is very painful for me to impose this order on you as the castle holds historic and sentimental value to the community,' Andrade wrote, 'due to the extreme hazards it presents, I find it necessary to protect the safety of all.' The Board of Selectmen is holding a public hearing Wednesday on changes in the deed proposed by the owners, including ending the public's right to access the property.","Kimball Castle, overlooking Lake Winnipesaukee, New Hampshire, has been derelict for decades .

"The future of the HS2 rail project was thrown into doubt last night after devastating evidence exposed the full extent of the environmental havoc that will be wreaked by the high-speed line. Information obtained by The Mail on Sunday reveals HS2 will blight the lives of more than 500,000 unsuspecting people along a 40-mile-wide corridor through the heart of Middle England. According to HS2’s own information, during the seven-year construction phase, huge convoys of trucks will rumble through dozens of peaceful towns and villages far from the line itself, bringing chaos and congestion in their wake. The convoys could also put lives at risk, warn campaigners from the Campaign to Protect Rural England (CPRE) who forced HS2 bosses to disclose the bombshell information. The report will fuel growing pressure on the Government to abandon the scheme. Would HS2 be good for Britain? David Cameron has said he . is determined to go ahead with it, but faces mounting opposition from . Tory MPs whose constituencies face being cut to shreds by the scheme. But this newspaper has established that several Cabinet Ministers – including, crucially, Environment Secretary Owen Paterson – have doubts about HS2. A well-placed source said: ‘Owen’s view is that he will subject it to such tough environmental tests that he will kill off the whole thing.’ The CPRE analysis – published in the form of maps available online from today – will reinforce those who agree with Mr Paterson. And the doubts have spread to senior figures in other parties. Former Labour Trade Minister Peter Mandelson has questioned HS2’s viability, while UKIP leader Nigel Farage has been a long-term fierce critic of the scheme. Until now, official consultation exercises on the estimated £50 billion project had suggested only those living closest to the proposed route would suffer any impact on their lives and the value of their homes. Countryside at Ashley village,Cheshire, where the proposed route will go past, scenic views across the Cheshire countryside threatened by the proposed HS2 link between London and Manchester . But after weeks of requests from the CPRE, HS2 finally released a starkly different picture of the dramatic effects of the construction phase, which will last up to seven years, set to begin in 2017. CPRE senior transport campaigner Ralph Smyth said: ‘It is not acceptable that it took a charity to uncover this and let up to half a million people know that they will be affected by this project.’ The CPRE’s inquiries revealed: . Controversial: Stop HS2 protest signs in Wendover, Buckinghamshire where locals are concerned over the impact the link will have on their countryside . He said: ‘We asked HS2 for all the data on the construction and the scheme itself. The draft Environmental Statement was published on May 16 and that’s when we asked for the full data. ‘I was chasing the data all the time and they just kept saying “it’s  coming by email” or “it’s in the post”.’ When The Mail on Sunday broke the news to MPs, councillors and residents in the affected communities, we were met with shock  at the scale of the impending invasion – and anger that no one had warned them. South Northamptonshire Tory MP  Andrea Leadsom predicted an ‘appalling’ impact on her constituents from construction and called for compensation. ‘There’s no doubt that residents are devastated by the prospect of the noise, traffic and pollution in such beautiful and ancient countryside,’ she said. ‘The impact during construction is going to be appalling and will damage South Northamptonshire for ever. It is already leaving hundreds of home owners with permanent blight and misery, as well as huge financial loss. Actor Geoffrey Palmer has thrown his weight behind the no campaign, pictured at a protest in Gt. Missenden, Bucks, which is in the path of the proposed route for the HS2 rail line . ‘If this project goes ahead, there has to be generous compensation including a property bond to make sure people can move on with their lives,’ she added. ‘Hearing about the prospective construction blight right across my constituency just adds to the need for hard and convincing evidence that HS2 will give taxpayers value for money versus other possible infrastructure projects.’ Experts at the Chilterns Conservation Board have calculated that the spoil from tunnelling in their area alone could result in 1.7 million lorry journeys, or a truck using local roads every 26 seconds every working day for five years. In Princes Risborough, more than six miles from the line, residents had expected HS2 to leave them largely unaffected. But the CPRE has discovered the pretty market town, on the ancient Icknield Way path, will be effectively cut into three by the lorries’ routes. Princes Risborough’s mayor and district councillor Alan Turner said: ‘People will be mortified. Our roads network is already in a shocking state through lack of investment, so having so many of these great big lorries will cause serious damage. ‘This will surely affect property prices – after all, once these trucks start rolling and prospective buyers see large numbers of these vehicles trundling through, it’s bound to deter people. Safety is also a huge concern – we already have around 16,000 vehicle movements a day through Risborough and only a few weeks back a young boy was knocked down on a zebra crossing and seriously injured.’ The film director behind the iconic James Bond title sequences expressed his horror at trucks coming through his home village of Caversfield, Oxfordshire. Daniel Kleinman, 57, owns a  manor house which has the village’s stunning 12th Century church in its grounds. Mr Kleinman said he could scarcely believe he and neighbours hadn’t been told about the HS2 traffic and said: ‘I think it’s very underhand and unfair that small villages in rural places should be subjected to something like this for so many years without people being asked about it. ‘We already have a traffic problem here so I can only imagine this is going to make it a lot worse.’ In Charwelton, Northamptonshire, Mike Rowell, 56, a project manager for Jaguar Land Rover, said: ‘I knew absolutely nothing about this. Why is it not part of the public consultation process? ‘We need to be aware about this if it’s going to have a significant negative impact on our house prices. ‘We only moved here six months ago, to get away from it all. It’s a fantastic place –  you come here to forget about  everything. But if huge convoys  of lorries are going up and down 24/7, there’s going to be a hell of  a noise.’ In the tiny village of Wing, Bucks, Jane Clarke 67, shuddered at the prospect of more heavy lorries storming past her 16th Century cottage, which sits on a busy tight bend. The retired NHS administrator, whose home was built in 1556, said: ‘This road is already an absolute nightmare. The traffic is constant and never stops as  it is. ‘I don’t understand why they are wasting  so much money on a high-speed rail line when we need a bypass around the  village. To me, it’s a total  nonsense. ‘We have two schools in the village and I don’t think any one has thought about the safety aspect of having heavy goods vehicles coming through. It’s a recipe for disaster.’ In a statement, the CPRE said:  ‘HS2 was supposed to free up space on the railways to get lorries off  the roads. Progress: The M1 pictured in 1971, many supporters of HS2 liken critics to those who opposed the building and expansion of the central motorway in the fifties and sixties . Fierce critic: UKIP leader Nigel Farage is strongly opposed to HS2 . ‘But people in dozens of sleepy villages many miles from the route will be finding out today that it could mean the opposite for them. ‘The plans for building it would mean endless convoys of lorries  taking to their local roads, at best destroying their peace and quiet, at worst putting local people’s lives  in danger. ‘Less than ten per cent of the materials required to build HS1 were taken by road. ‘The Government seems not to want to try to beat the standard set by HS1 in terms of minimising HGV construction traffic on local roads. This simply isn’t good enough. ‘If these roads are not going to break up under the strain, the Government needs to give additional funding to local authorities to tackle the maintenance backlog for roads in the areas likely to be affected. ‘Many rural roads have no safe space for walking, cycling or horse riding, so new parallel paths should be considered along routes likely to be affected by construction traffic.’ Hilary Wharf, from the HS2  Action Alliance, a campaign group set up to challenge the high-speed rail link, said: ‘The Government has not been honest about how extensively HS2 will blight people’s homes and disrupt their lives. ‘Experience shows that people on the route lose 30 per cent of the value of their homes. ‘So people who thought they were safe from HS2 will be given an unpleasant surprise.’ Among the other effects of HS2 will be that areas of tranquillity such as Danes Moor in Northamptonshire, site of the Wars of the Roses Battle of Edgecote Moor, and the village of Cubbington, Warwickshire, will face disruption . In Phase Two of the project, the lines extending from Birmingham to Manchester and Leeds will blight other peaceful spots, such as Waterton Park in West Yorkshire and  Cannock Chase and Fradley Junction in Staffordshire. Several picturesque locations will also be permanently transformed by embankments, viaducts and cuttings, including 16th Century Lightshaw Hall in Golborne, Wigan,  which could face demolition, and a Roman site at Red Hill in Ratcliffe-on-Soar, Nottinghamshire, where a viaduct could be built. An HS2 spokesman said: ‘We have considered all construction access routes as part of the development of the draft Environmental Statement on which we consulted earlier  this year. ‘The consultation was open to all members of the public to respond and express potential concerns or suggest alternatives. We have sought to provide construction access with minimal disruption and will continue to work with local communities to take on board their views. ‘In developing the subsequent formal Environmental Statement, we will be considering how we can further reduce any adverse impacts.’ The spokesman added: ‘HS2 Ltd is still developing transport routes for the construction of the line, accordingly it is not possible to definitively say how the road network will be used. The information supplied to the CPRE is based on the most accurate assessment, given the progress of the line’s design at the time.’","People will be affected along a 40-mile-wide corridor of the country .

"Mix-up: Fayah Hussain discovered lumps of chicken in a Boots' vegetarian Simply Cheese and Tomato Salad after buying the product from a store in Birmingham Airport . Boots has removed its cheese and tomato pasta pot meals from its shelves after a customer complained she tucked into the vegetarian snack – and swallowed a mouthful of chicken. The product was pulled after teenager Fayah Hussain, a Muslim who only eats halal meat, found the meat in the dish which had been labelled with a green V to mark it as a vegetarian cuisine. Last night, the retail giant admitted it had received a small number of complaints about the Delicious Simply Cheese and Tomato Salad and temporarily removed the meal from its stores. Fayah, who purchased the fast food at . Birmingham Airport’s Boots outlet last Friday, alleges she was only offered a £1.90 refund and snack bar when she complained to staff about the meat content at the branch. Fayah, . from Yardley Wood, Birmingham, said: 'Muslims who have passed through . Birmingham Airport must have eaten this without knowing. It’s . disgusting. 'But this isn’t just about Muslims. How many vegetarians have eaten meat without knowing?' Fayah said she knew immediately that there was a problem with the dish when she tasted it. She added: 'As soon as I bit into it, I knew there was something different. 'When I looked into the pot and saw the chicken pieces, I really didn’t know what to do. 'I . had been fasting for a month. Ramadan had just finished and it was the . first time I was able to eat at work – and this happens! 'I felt ill, then threw-up in the toilet. When I complained, I was told this is not the first time.

"Accused: Daniel Green is suspected of killing his mother, sister, niece and seven-month-old nephew . A forty-year-old man obsessed with Selena Gomez has been accused of murdering his mother and sister, along with her teenage daughter and baby, at the Oklahoma City home they all shared on Wednesday night. Daniel Green was arrested near a 7-11 store a couple of hours after a family friend raised the alarm at around 11pm after finding bloody footprints on the doormat, and the bodies. Green faces charges of killing his 57-year-old mother, Sallie, his sister Rebecca Cizek, 34, and her two children Katherine, 16, and seven-month-old Amario Dominguez III. The state medical examiner said Mrs Green and the baby died of gunshot wounds to the head. It has not yet been said how Ms Cizek and her teenage daughter died, according to The Oklahoman. Helicopters were used to search for Green and police circulated his description to nearby stores after neighbors told them the 40-year-old was often seen pacing the sidewalk and buying energy drinks. He was arrested close to a 7-11, after the clerk recognized him and contacted police, according to Fox25. A police spokesman confirmed Green's relationship to his alleged suspects and said that a family friend, who lived at the address, had returned home to discover the bodies. The motive for the killing is not known, but if Green is found guilty his obsession with young star Selena Gomez may be a factor, a psychologist told News 9. The 40-year-old's Facebook page was filled with pictures and posts about the star, including many that suggested he was fantasizing that he was in a relationship with her. Victim: Rebecca Cizek's body was found in the Oklahoma City home she shared with her brother and mother . Tragic: Katherine, who was due to start her sophomore year at high school, and her baby brother Amario . Crime scene: The family's bodies were found inside this home by a friend who lived with them . 'This person is obviously significantly troubled, then that frustration and those problems may build up to the point that he felt like he had no other options,' Dr Steven Sternlof said. He added that although he had not met Green or treated him, he could recognize the warning signs, News 9 reported. 'Someone that may have an obsession, in this case with a celebrity, might have a compulsion to respond in a certain way, thinking that this celebrity is in love with them or they're in love with the celebrity and they need to be close together, and they may need to stop others that are interfering in that relationship,' Dr Sternlof said. In his Facebook posts, Green makes constant reference to Gomez and posted a threat against her celebrity boyfriend in October 2011, saying: 'Justin Bieber is going to get a bullet in his head'. Neighbors claimed Green often spoke to them about his past lives or was seen talking to himself, according to NewsChannel 4.

"Loss: Matt Kocher, 15, drowned after he was overcome by a riptide while in Lake Michigan . A family whose only child drowned at a Christian summer camp last month have suffered yet more anguish after internet trolls mocked the teenager across webpages set up in his memory. Matthew Kocher, 15, died after he was overcome by a riptide while swimming in Lake Michigan on July 27, leaving his parents, John and Kathleen Kocher heartbroken. As the couple prepared to bury their son, they received a call from a nephew telling them not to look on the internet - as his memory pages had been defaced by vile trolls. Family and friends had set up a Facebook memorial page to celebrate the life of the teenager, an honors student and a star football player in his home town of Tinley Park, Illinois. 'LOL u drowned you fail at being a fish,' read one message which was accompanied by a photo of a submerged person's hand breaking through the water, the Chicago Tribune reported. Another post showed a video featuring a masked dancer saying, 'you're dead' as other photographs of dead people appeared on the screen, a relative told the Tribune. 'I was very angry right away, and then I said, ""Well, these are some dirtbags"",' Matt's father John said. 'How could they possibly want to do that? How could somebody want to be so evil, so vile?' Other people from Matt's school, Andrew High School, said they were shocked by the treatment. 'It just really disturbed me that someone would actually make fun of someone else dying,' Emily Berkheimer said. Cruel: After his death, vile internet trolls mocked him on Facebook pages set up in his memory . The page has now been removed and another has been set up; members of the group must now be approved. It is a place where he is remembered as a bright, kind teenager who loved playing football, basketball and volleyball, and who was about to begin his sophomore year in school. 'If you had to order up a dream child, it was him,' his mother said. On the new group, friends have shared images of Matt, while others have sent his grieving parents kind messages of support. The couple told the Tribune that the family's dog, Mya, still goes to the teeanger's bed, waiting for him to come home.

"A gardener has broken the record for growing the world’s biggest gooseberry - four years after losing the crown to a rival green-fingered pensioner. Kelvin Archer, 53, has produced the fruit which weighs 64.49g - around the size of a large egg. It is the first gooseberry ever to weigh more than 40 pennyweights - an ancient system used to measure the popular summer treat. Bumper crop: Kelvin Archer, aged 53, Head Gardener at Rode Hall poses with his prized 'Worlds Biggest Gooseberry' Kelvin’s whopping gooseberry outweighed the previous record-breaking fruit - grown by pensioner Bryan Nellist, 76, in 2009 - by over two grams. Mr Nellist, from Whitby, North Yorks., beat Kelvin after a bitter row over weighing methods which vary between regions. Guinness World Records eventually ruled in Mr Nellist’s favour but this week Kelvin reclaimed the crown with his prized fruit. Kelvin, resident gardener at elegant Rode Hall in Scholar Green, Cheshire, grows 30 types of gooseberries on 100 different trees in between his official duties at the stately home. Whopper: A standard Gooseberry is totally dwarfed by Kelvin Archer's World Record sized Gooseberry, right . He feeds his gooseberry bushes with a secret nutrient recipe and monitors their progress round-the-clock from his cottage in the grounds. Speaking today, Kelvin, a professional gardener of 31 years, said he was thrilled to net the new record. Married Kelvin, who has three grown-up daughters, added: 'I’m absolutely delighted to reclaim the record. 'I had to have witnesses there as well as the secretary of Mid-Cheshire Gooseberry Association. Previous record holder: Brian Nellist, 73, pictured with his award-winning Gooseberry in 2009 . 'I didn’t know if it would set the record until it was picked and weighed, I couldn’t believe it when I found out the weight. 'Everyone was really pleased for me and delighted that I’ve brought the record back to Cheshire, since it’s been in Yorkshire for a few years. 'The nicest thing was the previous record holder, Bryan Nellist, rang me the next day to congratulate me. 'I’ve been doing this for years, it’s my hobby. I came from a village called Marton in Cheshire where everyone grew and shared gooseberries, so it went from there. 'My dad and neighbours grew them, and we entered competitions - it’s become a bit of an obsession. 'I take most of the gooseberries off the trees, that helps the others to grow bigger. 'With the bad weather, last year was hopeless, and there was only one grown weighing over 30 pennyweights. This year is much better.' Kevin Staton, 54, secretary of Mid-Cheshire Gooseberry Association said he knew the gooseberry would be a record breaker when he saw it dangling on the branch. He said: 'I was really pleased for Kelvin. He’s worked hard over the years with his gooseberries and deserves to reclaim the record. 'I’m sure other Cheshire gooseberry growers will be delighted for him, and hopefully it will attract new members. 'The record gooseberry was absolutely huge, it was the size of a large duck egg or a kiwi. His is the first gooseberry over 40 pennyweights, a fantastic achievement.' Kelvin’s gooseberry, measured according to Cheshire’s rules, weighed 41 pennyweights and 11 and a quarter grains. Mr Nellist previously held the record with a 39 pennyweight (62.01 g) fruit grown in his back garden. Eclipsing all others: Kelvin Archer, Head Gardener at Rode Hall, puts other Gooseberry growers in the shade with this prized specimen . A row broke out due to a difference in the weighing systems used by North-West and Yorkshire growers when the pensioner submitted his world record claim in 2009. Guinness adjudicators eventually found in Mr Nellist’s favour after working out the weight of his fruit in grams. Gooseberry growers in the North West record their weight in pennyweights and grains, with a pennyweight equalling 1.55g. Growers across the Pennines changed to a system of drams and grains, with a dram equalling 1.77g. Pennyweights and grains have been used to measure goosberries for around 250 years. Rivalry between the pair dates back 20 years when Kelvin first claimed the world record in 1993. Mr Nellist beat his fruit in 2009 until Kelvin’s latest gooseberry broke the world record again this year. Kelvin said: 'Gooseberries take a lot of nurturing, you have to feed them a lot of manure, you must cover them from the rain and prune others to let the bigger ones thrive. 'Myself and Mr Nellist have enjoyed a friendly rivalry for years and no doubt he’ll be back in his garden planning how to beat me with next year’s crop.'","Kelvin Archer, 53, from Cheshire, has produced the fruit which weighs 64.49g .

"Crackdown: Justice Secretary Chris Grayling said a tougher approach is needed with prisoners who brag that the system is easy . Two violent thugs caught boasting of their easy prison life on Facebook have been stripped of their perks, put in segregation and face a police investigation. Justice Secretary Chris Grayling reacted with fury to the pictures published in yesterday’s Mail showing Sonny Barker and Korrel Kennedy posing in their cell and surrounded by gadgets. Mr Grayling demanded the prison authorities ‘throw the book’ at the pair, who now face having up to 42 extra days added to their sentences. The thugs – whose antics have sparked a new ‘soft justice’ row – have lost their TV, are being made to wear prison uniform and could be moved to a tougher jail. Police have also been informed. Having a mobile phone in jail is a criminal offence carrying a two-year sentence, but prison officials rarely bother to call in the police. Mr Grayling is determined that faith in the entire prison system should not be undermined by thugs boasting on Facebook. Between July 2009 and June 2011 a shocking 342 inmates, including murderers, were caught using the social networking site while locked up. The pictures show Barker and Kennedy with a PlayStation, as well as a TV that is showing a music channel. Other pictures appear to show a cell filled with a mini-fridge, sound system, piles of snacks and posters of topless women. Barker, 20, was jailed for eight years after he held a mother and daughter at knifepoint in their home during a burglary. But the serial offender smuggled a phone into his cell at HMP Rochester in Kent to show off his cushy surroundings. Kennedy, 20, a former Jean Paul Gaultier model, was jailed for chasing a man with a knife and threatening hospital staff. Bragging: Sonny Barker (left) and Korrel Kennedy (right) posted pictures with a mobile phone they were not supposed to have. Carrying a phone is a criminal offence and carries a two-year sentence . Consequences: The men have had their TV taken away and have been forced to wear prison uniforms. They could face an extra 42 days on top of their jail terms . In his first post on Facebook on June . 29, Barker wrote: ‘What’s happening! Coming from live from prison. Whos . (sic) missing me.’ He added: ‘I’ll be home soon. Real soon December . 2015.’ When one friend wrote he had ‘it on . smash’ – prison slang for living an easy life inside – he replied: ‘When . haven’t I had it on smash? Admit it, been bossing since Elmley . [Prison].’ HMP Rochester is . a Category C young offender institution for 650 males deemed . untrustworthy and likely to try to escape. Past inspections have found . evidence of bullying and a Fight Club-style culture. The men now face being moved to a . Category B jail. Decisions on whether to add days to their sentences . will be taken by an independent adjudicator within days. Last . night a Ministry of Justice spokesman said: ‘We are introducing a tough . new regime in our prisons, and we are serious about enforcing it. 'Prisoners are not allowed to access social networking sites, and we do not tolerate this kind of behaviour. ‘When an offender breaks the rules, we strip them of their privileges and they are dealt with severely. This is the right thing to do, and it sends a clear signal to any other prisoner who might step out of line.’ Mr Grayling has made a determined effort to stop prisons being seen as ‘holiday camps’. But there are concerns that the tough message has yet to properly filter down to individual jails, with governors taking action over Facebook only when a minister intervenes. Ministers have now issued new guidelines reminding jails of their duty to act.","Sonny Barker and Korrel Kennedy, both 20, could have 42 days added to jail sentences .

"TV watchdog Ofcom has warned broadcasters about airing violence before 9pm after Channel 4 soap Hollyoaks was found to have breached programme rules. The regulator said a scene in the soap aired in March in which a lead character was pushed under a train was 'violent and shocking' and unsuitable for pre-9pm viewing. Channel 4 argued it had taken measures to comply with the watershed rules. The regulator is now commissioning research into viewers' attitudes towards on-screen violence and  assessing whether the amount of violence on British TV in everything from documentaries to dramas has increased over the decades. Scroll down for video . Violence: The scene marked the culmination of a long-running revenge storyline involving a former undercover policeman, Walker (right), and ex-drug dealer Brendan (left) Scene: There were no images of Walker being hit by the train but the fight in the build-up included several blows to the face and stomach . It will look specifically at shows scheduled before and immediately after the 9pm watershed. The announcement came as Ofcom issued a statement to 'remind television broadcasters of the need to ensure that all material broadcast pre-watershed which features violent scenes is appropriately limited'. 'Broadcasters should consider whether individual acts of violence within a programme are suitable, as well as where the overall tone is malevolent, menacing and threatening, that this also remains suitably limited,' it said. Hollyoaks breached broadcasting rules in an episode, screened at 6.30pm in March, in which a main character was killed by a speeding train. The scene marked the culmination of a . long-running revenge storyline involving a former undercover policeman, . Walker, and ex-drug dealer Brendan. It ended with Walker screaming as he fell backwards on to the railway track and into the path of a train before the camera cut away to show the train passing at high speed. There were no images of Walker being hit by the train but the fight in the build-up included several blows to the face and stomach, Brendan’s head being pushed through railings, Walker with bloody lips and blood running from his nose, while viewers heard the groans as they inflicted blows. Channel 4 said that the storyline had run . for around a year and that viewers were notified that a dramatic . episode would be broadcast. Defence: Channel 4 said that the storyline had run for around a year and that viewers were notified that a dramatic episode would be broadcast . Dramatic: The scene ended with Walker screaming as he fell backwards on to the railway track and into the path of a train before the camera cut away to show the train passing at high speed . It said that the fight scene only lasted around a minute, was at the end of the episode and carefully edited. The watershed was first introduced in the Television Act of 1964 to ensure programmes before 9pm were suitable for family viewing. Swearing and sex and violence in shows such as Big Brother, One Night With Robbie Williams and The Bill have been criticised in recent years for their pre-9pm content. Top of the Pops was also condemned after 65 people complained to Ofcom about bondage scenes in a George Michael video (below). Last year, the Sky-run service Pick TV, which is on Freeview, was found to have breached rules when variants of the F-word were aired five times in a programme called Road Wars, which was shown at 6pm. Sony Entertainment Television was also rapped last year after it showed US film 'Hanging Up' in an 8pm slot which included repeated use of the F-word. E! Entertainment was found to have breached the broadcasting code by broadcasting nude women in editions of Girls Of The Playboy Mansion (below) throughout the day when children could be watching. The regulator has also previously ruled that 50 Cent's music videos contained 'highly sexualised images' and 'offensive language'. And an episode of Emmerdale involving a fight between the King brothers, and a gang attack on Eastenders, were also previously raised as scenes for concern. Ofcom said that it accepted that . violence was 'a part of life and integral to many dramas, including . those broadcast pre-watershed.' But . it said that the pre-programme information was too vague and would 'not . have prepared the significant number of younger viewers in the . audience, or their parents, adequately for the violent, intense and . shocking scenes which followed.' It said: 'This scene was both violent and shocking and had the potential to distress younger viewers as well as raise concerns about the level of violence amongst parents watching with their children regardless of the editorial context presented or the signposting provided. For all these reasons Ofcom considered that it was unsuitable for children.' The watchdog added: ‘It was clearly intended to leave viewers with the impression that both characters experienced violent punches to the head and body, as was evident from the blood on their faces as a result of these blows and the groans and moans from the characters.' It said that research, carried out in 2010, showed that parents’ biggest concerns about pre-watershed content was violence, sexually explicit content and offensive language. Soaps were the programmes which caused most concern. Channel 4 argued that Hollyoaks, which regularly deals with story lines about sexual abuse, domestic violence and drugs, was aimed at a teenage audience. But Ofcom said figures showed that 15  per cent of the audience of the train death episode were children aged four to 15 and 10 per cent were aged four to nine. The watchdog 'concluded that cumulatively the violent content in this sequence exceeded viewers’ expectations for a drama transmitted long before the watershed when young children were available to view and in this case were watching in large numbers'. Ofcom said that there was no reliable research into the attitudes of UK viewers on the issue of violence before and just after the watershed. It intends to publish its new research next year. Tony Close, its director of content standards, said: 'Broadcasters have a duty to protect children from violent material. The rules in this area are very clear, making it unacceptable for any broadcaster to include scenes of violence that are unsuitable for children before the watershed. 'The protection of under-18s from potentially harmful content is a key area of concern for Ofcom. As such we have commissioned new research into viewers’ attitudes to violence on television. 'This will further inform us about the level of concern about violence on television - and will contribute to our ongoing work on the enforcement of the 9pm watershed.' A Channel 4 spokesman said ‘correct editorial processes were followed’ and it was ‘committed to ensuring all Hollyoaks storylines are appropriate for a pre-watershed audience’.","Ofcom said the Hollyoaks scene was too 'violent and shocking' for pre-9pm .

He even agreed to be pictured in the clothes he wore in Praia da Luz, on May 3, 2007, to prove he was the man in the police sketch previously seen as key to cracking the case.

The Metropolitan Police last night confirmed it had ruled out a sighting of the man previously seen near the McCanns’ Portuguese apartment. Jane Tanner, a close friend of Kate and Gerry, previously told officers she saw a dark-haired man carrying away a child wearing pink floral pyjamas at 9.15pm on May 3, 2007.

But this has been found not to involve Madeleine.

She appeared to be in an uncomfortable position with her head slumped against him. DCI Redwood said: 'Our focus in terms of . understanding what happened on the night of May 3 has now given us a . shift of emphasis. We are almost certain that the man seen by Jane .

She added that the pair might be transferred to the tough Ancon 2 prison in the desert outside Lima. The women were caught in August smuggling £1.5million worth of cocaine out of Peru. McCollum and Reid initially claimed they were kidnapped, held at gunpoint and forced to board a flight from Lima to Spain with 24lbs of cocaine in food packets hidden inside their luggage when they were arrested. But in September McCollum, from Dungannon, Co Tyrone, and co-accused Reid, from Glasgow, pleaded guilty to drug smuggling when they appeared before a judge. They had hoped the behind-closed-doors admission would be enough to secure a shorter sentence . However, the prosecutor in charge of their case said that the pair could face a six-month investigation if their guilty pleas are rejected. Speaking after the hearing, Juan Mendoza said that the women's confessions had not satisfied prosecutors. If their pleas are turned down by the court, prosecutors could force them to return to the interrogation room and give more details about the smuggling gang which allegedly gave them the drugs. Mr Mendoza refused to say whether or not the women had told him anything more about the gang. In a video, Reid says she was forced to take 'these bags' in her luggage.

I’m hoping she’s going to be a veterinarian one day,' he said. While both his and Marel's parents have petitioned for custody of Arianna, Remy said he'd prefer his parents to get custody because of their financial means. He also said he has no intention of contacting his daughter while he remains behind bars. 'If she chooses to know me at some point and wants to see me, that’s fine. If she doesn’t, that’s fine, too. I just want her to be happy. I love her. I want her to go to high school, I want her to go to college, I want her to have everything in life she  deserves,' he said. While Remy admitted his past steroid abuse, he said he'd stopped using them. 'I wasn’t currently taking them,' he said. Remy also expressed regret over the pain this is causing his famous father, as well as his mother. 'They’re very good people. I wish the media would leave them alone. None of this is their fault. They don’t need to be dragged down in this, too,' he said. Remy is slated to the arraigned this week. Longtime Boston Red Sox broadcaster Jerry Remy has opened . up about the allegations that his son stabbed to death his girlfriend, saying that . his ‘disgust and remorse’ were indescribable. In a statement released through his Twitter account , Remy said he and his wife are ‘heartbroken’ over the death of . Jennifer Martel. Jennifer Martel's five-year-old daughter Ariana witnessed her mother's brutal murder last August . ‘Words cannot describe my wife's and my grief,’ Jerry Remy . wrote. ‘Son or not, I am at loss for words articulating my disgust and remorse . over this senseless and tragic act.’ Police arrived at the residence in the Windsor Village apartment complex . at around 9.30pm August 15 following multiple 911 calls. They found . Martel bleeding in the fenced-in patio covered in stab wounds. Middlesex . Assistant District Attorney Lisa McGovern said Remy attacked Martel in . the kitchen, in the living room and on a stairway before pinning her to . the ground of the patio where he stabbed her repeatedly. 'Great force and great effort was made by this defendant in stabbing Miss Martel over and over and over again' McGovern said, labeling the attack a 'protracted struggle.' Remy was arrested at the scene after he held . his hands over his head and surrendered to officers. His clothing was . soaked with Martel's blood and, according to WBZ-TV, he had an . engagement ring in a sunglasses case in his pocket. Just . feet away lay Martel's body, shirtless and covered in blood with stab . wounds to her front left shoulder area as well as wounds to her neck. A . blue cloth covered her face. Attorney: Jared Remy, right, speaks to his attorney Peter Bella in Waltham District Court during his arraignment. The bulky Remy has admitted to steroid abuse in the past but claimed in an interview that he was not using them at the time of his arrest . Witnesses: Neighbors saw Remy, left, repeatedly stabbing Martel, right with the couple's daughter . 'There . was a substantial amount of blood on the ground surrounding the . victim's head and upper torso area,' police said. 'Martel was . motionless, not breathing.' Remy, who in 2005 . admitted beating up a former girlfriend, appeared in Waltham District . Court to face allegations that he assaulted Martel in a domestic . violence incident not long before the murder. He allegedly threw her against a mirror. He was released on personal . recognizance, and Ryan said that . the bail recommendation made by her office was based, in part, on a . conversation with Martel. 'The bail recommendation was based on a totality of circumstances,' Ryan said. She . added: 'A (bail) request was made based on the . information that we had on Wednesday. Obviously and tragically, there is . different information today, Friday morning.' Famous father: Jerry Remy and his wife have petitioned for custody of their 5-year-old granddaughter . History: Remy was released from jail for assaulting Martel just two days before her murder . Martel's mother told The Boston Herald that her daughter had been 'planning her escape' when she was allegedly murdered by her long-time boyfriend. 'She . said, ""I was planning my escape,""' Patty Martel, 53, said. 'This was on . Wednesday. She said, ""Don’t worry, I’m planning my escape.""' Her mother is furious Remy was released after the assault and blames the blunder for her daughter's death. '(Prosecutors) did not do their job,' Patty Martel said. 'They failed. She would be alive today if they had put him away.' Patty Martel said her daughter had returned to her apartment to get her belongings before fleeing. 'She . went back to the house to go get stuff and that's when he killed her,' she said. 'And that's why he killed her, because she called the cops on . him.' At least one . neighbor, Benjamin Ray, in the apartment complex rushed to Martel's aid . and tried to pull Remy off her. But he was driven back when Remy waved . his knife in Ray's direction, McGovern said. 'It's not an easy thing to watch. It's not an easy thing to try and stop,' Ray told Boston.com. 'I did what I could to stop it. And it wasn't enough.' Witnesses told police they saw Remy 'on top of Miss Martel stabbing her repeatedly with the knife' on the patio. Remy pleaded not guilty and . has been ordered held without bail. Remy's defense attorney, Peter . Bella, did not contest the bail order. Police found Miss Martel dying from multiple stab wounds at the Windsor Village apartment complex in Waltham, Massachusetts last summer . Remy has maintained his innocence in the brutal murder of his girlfriend last year . 'I've been in contact with the Remys. They are devastated, he said. 'This is a very sad and tragic day for two families.' Patty Martel described her daughter as 'an excellent, loving mother' to her daughter Arianna. 'She . had so much to look forward to in her life,' she said. 'She planned on . getting married, but she broke it off and told me she was never going to . marry him. ... In the last few years my daughter wasn't happy. He would . do anything and everything to keep them away from us. It got worse in . the last few months but she never told me it was to the point where it . was this.' She said she was determined to take custody of her granddaughter. 'I . don't want him to get his hands on her. If he gets out that's the first . thing he's going to do is try to get her. He just traumatized his . daughter for the rest of her life.' A neighbor told Boston.com: 'It's creepy, it's a couple hundred yards from my window,' as Waltham police and State Police investigated the bloody . crime scene. 'The little girl was literally selling lemonade the other . day.' Remy suffered an unspecified injury . that wasn't self-inflicted, authorities said. He was taken to a hospital . and released before the arraignment. Another neighbor described Remy as a very nice guy, though he had 15 prior cases out of Waltham District Court between 1998-2010, according to the Boston Herald. In 2009, Remy, then a security guard . for the Red Sox, and a colleague were accused of using steroids. He was . fired after he admitted using the performance-enhancing drug, but he . denied supplying steroids to his coworker. The couple's daughter was unhurt is now in the custody of the Department of Children and Families. They also had two pitbulls.","Jared Remy, 34, is charged with murder and domestic assault in the gruesome stabbing death of Jennifer Martel .

"Blackmail: Married physics teacher Zahid Akram, 37, posed as a boy online and persuaded schoolgirls and young women to send him explicit pictures . A married physics teacher blackmailed schoolgirls and young women into sending him sexually explicit photos of themselves, a court heard. Father-of-two Zahid Akram, 37, would persuade his victims to send him pictures in their underwear and then threaten to forward them on to their family if they did not send more. Detectives believe Akram may have contacted hundreds of youngsters on Badoo while posing as a schoolboy. The teacher was warned he faces a long spell behind bars by a judge at Exeter Crown Court after he admitted four charges of blackmail and one of causing or inciting a child aged 13-17 to prostitution or pornography. Police believe there are victims in . Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland and in England - but none south of . Bristol because Akram was employed as a science teacher at . Woodroffe School in Lyme Regis, Dorset. Officers said his demands were about 'empowerment rather than sexual gratification'. Akram had a dozen different profiles on Badoo he used to coerce his victims into handing over pictures. Judge Francis Gilbert QC refused Akram, of Redditch, Worcestershire, bail and said: 'He knew perfectly well what he was doing. What he was doing was extremely nasty. 'He persuaded a number of young girls to take off their clothes and show themselves wearing their underwear, bra and knickers.' The judge said in one case he told a schoolgirl he knew the Christian names of her parents and would show them the pictures unless she sent more sexualised images. 'It put appalling pressure on her. It is a vile offence,' the judge said. 'He is an intelligent man, a teacher, he must have known what he was doing. It was appalling behaviour.' Detective Constable Steve Harris, of Devon and Cornwall Police who investigated the case, said Akram blackmailed vulnerable girls and young women aged between 13 and 30. Abuse: Akram, 37, was warned he faces a lengthy spell behind bars when he is sentenced at Exeter Crown Court (pictured) next month . 'I think there are hundreds of victims he has contacted. They are aged between 13 and 30 and they live all other the UK, in Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland and from Bristol upwards,' he said. 'He approached them online using Badoo and other social networking sites. He had at least twelve profiles, mostly young males but one was as a woman. 'He was getting them to take a picture of themselves, with say no top on. Once he got that he then asked them to so other things that they did not want to do. It was an increase in sexualisation. 'If they refused he threatened to show the pictures to friends and family or post them online. In some cases he demanded money from them - £20 or £40 to use to top up his phone. It wasn’t a vast amount of money but these were vulnerable victims. 'He was blackmailing these women. His demands were about empowerment rather than sexual gratification. He had very little control over his life at work or at home. 'He also had £40,000 debts and he was not very good with money. He needed some way of taking control and this is what he ended up doing. 'He has no previous convictions. The matter came to us because one of the victims contacted police. She was being blackmailed and bravely came forward. 'We traced him and seized his computer equipment and realised there were a lot of people to trace all around the country. 'I believe there are hundreds more victims out there. We have not been able to trace many of them but they can contact us even now.' The blackmail and incitement started in October 2009 and continued until January 2012. Akram will be sentenced at Exeter Crown Court on November 14. The judge warned him that he faces a prison sentence measured in ‘years not months’.","Zahid Akram 'may have contacted hundreds of victims online'

"Anthony Marsh (pictured), who is HIV positive, and Lee Davis have admitted grooming teenage boys on the internet before sexually abusing them . Health fears have been raised for thousands of boys who made contact with a prolific paedophile with HIV who groomed his victims online. Anthony Marsh, who has the virus, and Lee Davis used social networks such as Facebook and Bebo, as well as specialist gay websites, to befriend boys before sexually abusing them, South Yorkshire Police said. The pair have admitted a total of 55 sex offences against 10 boys. After grooming the boys online, salesman Marsh, and unemployed Davis would meet their victims and sexually abuse them. Marsh, 53, and Davis, 39, are known to have made contact with more than 2,700 children across the country. A total of 17 victims have been identified by police and have been tested negative for the virus. The pair admitted 55 sex offences at Sheffield Crown Court last month. Today, prosecutors decided they will not proceed with 14 allegations denied by the pair and Marsh and Davis will now be sentenced in December. The charges they admitted involved a . total of 10 victims - four of whom were abused by both defendants. But . officers say there are other victims they know about. The earliest offence the investigators have discovered so far dates back to 2005 and the 10 victims were aged between 13 and 17. South Yorkshire Police said Davis filmed . teenagers at his home or in his van. Officers believe some of the . footage shot by Marsh has been distributed by him over the web. Following their convictions, detectives are now keen to trace any more of their victims. Detective Inspector Delphine Waring said Marsh, from Hatfield, near Doncaster, and Davis, from Conisbrough, near Doncaster, were both family men whose wives and children were unaware of what they were doing. She said they spent hours online grooming their victims. Marsh and Davis (pictured) are known to have made contact with more than 2,700 children across the country . 'Both were family men, both leading double lives,' the detective said. 'As well as all the victims of these appalling crimes, the families of both of these men are victims as well. 'Their families have been completely betrayed by the horrendous activity that both of these men have been undergoing. 'Their crimes are absolutely . despicable. They've preyed on vulnerable young boys who have every . right, in this day and age, to be able to experiment and use the . internet. 'And . especially young boys who are perhaps confused about their sexuality, it . should be perhaps a safe environment for them to be able to experiment . and explore online. 'However, both of these men - obviously vastly older than all of the child victims - have gained their trust, have preyed on that vulnerability and groomed them entirely for the purpose of sexual exploitation and sexual abuse. 'And they've actually gone on to meet the young boys in whatever setting that may have been and committed vile, horrendous offences against them.' Life sentence: Catwell will be sentenced at Sheffield Crown Court, pictured, tomorrow . Ms Waring said: 'This abuse has been continuing for a long time. 'They've . been contacting people online, either on gay websites of social . networking sites such as Facebook, Bebo or BBM messaging, things like . that. 'They've been grooming the boys, . speaking to them online and then continuing that communication until . face-to-face meetings have taken place.' The detective said there was no evidence Marsh and Davis knew each other before they met online. 'Their crimes are absolutely despicable. They've preyed on vulnerable young boys who have every right, in this . day and age, to be able to experiment and use the internet' - Detective Inspector Delphine Waring . But, she said, they began to work together pooling information on potential victims. Ms Waring said she was confident that the pair were not acting as part of a larger paedophile ring. 'They clearly have spent an . extraordinarily large amount of time every day online, grooming and . gaining the trust of these young boys - a lot of whom were very young, . they were confused about their sexuality,' she said . The . detective said the pair were caught after Marsh was arrested in May . 2012 at a hotel in Scarborough, North Yorkshire, when he was spotted . with indecent images of children. South Yorkshire Police believe there could be other young men out there who are victims of Marsh and Davis and in need of help and support. Ms Waring said: 'That's definitely a possibility, unfortunately, purely because of the amount of time these men have been offending against young boys and because they have spent such an extraordinarily large amount of time online, grooming young boys. 'I've obviously made every effort to prioritise identifying any possible child victims but because of the scale of the offending, clearly there will be some young boys out there that unfortunately we haven't as yet been able to identify. If there are any young boys who have been offended against by these two I would urge them to come forward.' Ms Waring said many of the pair's victims were from South Yorkshire, although the others were from across the north of England and the Midlands. She said Davis and Marsh used pseudonyms but did not pose as teenagers. The pair appeared before a judge at Sheffield Crown Court on September 27 and admitted conspiracy to commit sexual activity with children, meeting a child following sexual grooming and a number of other sex offences - 55 charges in all. Marsh, who also used the names Tony Taylor and Tony Smith, admitted sexual activity with a child and possessing and distributing indecent images of children. Davis, who also used the name James Parkin, admitted raping a 13-year-old boy, sexual activity with a child and taking indecent photographs of a child. The conspiracy charge admitted by both men involves the contacting of young men to facilitate meetings for sexual offences between May 2004 and June this year. Marsh and Davis are both in custody and will be sentenced on December 2.","Anthony Marsh and Lee Davis groomed teenage boys on the internet .

"Fears: Esme Smith, 14, vanished after travelling to London ten days ago . A schoolgirl missing in London for ten days may have made a secret arrangement to meet someone in the capital, her family have said. Esme Smith, 14, vanished after travelling to central London on Thursday September 12 from her home in Farnham, Surrey, and fears for her safety are growing daily. Her elder sister Sian, 19, said in a video appeal asking Esme to get in touch: ‘I think maybe she’s met somebody out there or planned to meet somebody, we don’t know at the moment – that’s the most worrying thing. We’re incredibly worried.’ Her father Mark Smith, a former Royal Navy Lieutenant Commander who now works at Nato’s Joint Warfare Centre in Norway, said: ‘We’re worried sick. She’s just gone to ground. We’re baffled.’ Esme was last seen by friends after school in Farnham on the Thursday afternoon, where she told them she was going to Woking – 16 miles away – and then to a party. Instead, she changed out of her school uniform and caught a  train from Aldershot just after  4pm, arriving at London’s Waterloo station about an hour later. Detectives have released a CCTV image showing her walking down steps near Charing Cross station at  about 5.30pm. Her family’s concerns came as it emerged that Esme may have posted disturbing messages about casual sex when she was aged just 13 on notorious website ask.fm, which allows users to ask each other questions with the option of anonymity. The site has been implicated in several cases in which cyberbullying has led to suicide. In a question and answer session last October under Esme’s name, with a photograph which appeared to be her, she was asked if she would ‘ever consider friends with benefits?’ (a euphemism for casual sex). She answered ‘Yes’. When asked by her anonymous inquisitor with whom, she answered ‘A few guys, inbox [message] me who you are.’ She then added: ‘Well I go for older guys, sooo .  .  . ’ It has also emerged that the 14-year-old was bullied on the site. She was called 'a f****** dog' and a slut by internet trolls, according to The Sunday Mirror. And one mocking message questioned her popularity at her school, All Hallows Catholic School. According to the paper it said 'your not liked at all hallows at all haaa'. Scroll down for video .

Jenny is terribly worried and she just wants to know Esme is safe and misses her. 'She’s been on holiday with us and stayed over a lot, and we just want her back. 'Every time she has been here all we hear is laughter. She’s always happy and bubbly.’ He said neither he nor his daughter had any idea why Esme had travelled to London, adding: ‘We haven’t seen much of her because we’ve been away for most of the summer. We’re just really shocked. ‘What makes it even worse, is  that she was last seen leaving  Charing Cross and going to Villiers Street, and my office is on  Villiers Street.’ Esme Smith, 14, has not been seen since getting the train to London to go to a party more than a week ago .

"A Chinese official was removed from his post after he was pictured accepting a piggy back ride from a resident of a typhoon hit city through flood water - because he didn't want to ruin his shoes. A picture of the official, known only as Wang, sparked outrage when it was posted on Chinese social media website Sina Weibo. The photo was taken as Wang visited the city of Yuyao, in Zhejiang province, as the area suffered widespread flooding after being hit by a devastating typhoon which left 10 people dead. Piggy back: This picture, which went viral after it was posted on a Chinese social media website, appears to show an official being carried through typhoon flood waters because he did not want to ruin his shows . Natural disaster: Yuyao City, in Zhejiang province, China, was hit by heavy flooding following a typhoon. An official was reportedly pictured being carried across flood water because he didn't want to ruin his shoes . According to China's state-run news agency Xinhua, a caption posted alongside the photograph claimed that Wang was being carried because he was wearing a pair of expensive shoes made of cloth. But the Sanqishi Township government, which employed the official, claimed that he had been set to remove his shoes to walk barefoot to a flooding victim's house. But according to MSN reports, despite Wang's insistence that he would walk, the local picked him up anyway and carried him through the water. Wang was given a second piggy back by the man as the group left the house. Whether the official had intended to walk as suggested by reports or not, the online fuss created by the picture saw him removed from his post as director of the township's construction office.

"Dawn Aubrey-Ward's stepfather called on RSPCA to 'stop bullying people' The family of an RSPCA whistle-blower who committed suicide have spoken for the first time about her death, launching a blistering attack on the charity and calling on it to ‘stop bullying people’. Animal welfare officer Dawn Aubrey-Ward, 43, took her own life after publicly accusing the RSPCA of needlessly killing thousands of healthy animals. An inquest heard this week how the mother-of-four was discovered dead at home, just five months after she helped reveal in The Mail on Sunday that the charity had destroyed 53,000 animals in a year.  Her family say the RSPCA is partly responsible for her death. Miss Aubrey-Ward had spoken out after she left her job when she was accused of stealing a tortoise. She had claimed the animal was an unwanted pet which she had taken home to look after. Miss Aubrey-Ward’s stepfather, Michael Newport, said: ‘They treated her very, very badly. ‘If Dawn had been allowed to pursue her career with the RSPCA, which had been her childhood dream, I don’t think she would have gone down the road she did. If they had left her alone, she would have had a happy life.’ Mr Newport, a parish councillor, added: ‘I feel very strongly that she was badly treated by the RSPCA. They behave like a paramilitary organisation. They have to stop bullying people.’ Mr Newport, who is married to Miss Aubrey-Ward’s mother, Jean, is sad that his twice-divorced step-daughter did not live to witness the torrent  of criticism that the RSPCA received  following her decision to become  a whistleblower. ‘She would have wallowed in all the well-deserved bad publicity surrounding the charity since she blew the whistle on them in The Mail on Sunday. Hearing that the Charity Commission is investigating them would have made her very happy.’ According to her family, Miss Aubrey-Ward dreamed of becoming an RSPCA inspector all her life . Jean Newport, 64, of Stoke St Mary, Somerset, said: ‘Dawn was extremely distressed because lots of nasty things were said about her. ‘She had loved animals ever since she was a tiny child, and would go without food herself to feed her animals when she was broke. ‘Becoming an RSPCA inspector was a dream come true. She was over the moon when she qualified in 2008.’ Miss Aubrey-Ward, who was found hanged at her home in Matlock, Somerset, in May, strongly disagreed with her employer’s policy of putting down animals that couldn’t easily be re-homed. In an interview in The Mail on . Sunday, the former inspector, who once won an RSPCA award for rescuing a . stranded sheep from a cliff face, accused the RSPCA of killing . thousands of creatures unnecessarily. Her . mother said: ‘It was OK if the animals were very sick or too . traumatised to be pets, but it wasn’t just those animals that died. Dawn once received an RSPCA commendation for abseiling down a Cornish cliff face to rescue a stranded sheep . The 44-year-old animal lover was treated 'very badly' by the charity according to her family who have accused them of bullying . 'She told me lots of horrible stories, and got very angry and upset. ‘The job wasn’t what she had expected it to be, and her idea of  animal welfare was very different to that of the RSPCA. She found it tough, and when she didn’t agree with what was going on she had to speak her mind. She stuck to her principles and that made her unpopular.’ Mrs Newport said her daughter had been ‘devastated’ by some of the Twitter comments from ex-colleagues following the whistleblowing episode. ‘She was particularly distressed by one posting which said she didn’t care for her own animals, which she felt put a question mark over her as an animal lover. It was rubbish, but she took it to heart. 'Life will never be the same without Dawn. She was such a lovely, caring clever young woman. I can’t get used to her being gone. It just doesn’t seem real.’ Dawn Aubrey-Ward pictured aged 7 with her mother, Jean (left) and in 2008 (right) when she qualified to become an inspector for the RSPCA . The inquest heard how Miss Aubrey-Ward had been suffering from depression after her partner, Rob Colclough, had taken his own life in October 2011. She had also been experiencing financial difficulties and had issues with alcohol. After her disclosures last December, the charity released a statement saying she was ‘merely a disgruntled former employee’ and suggesting she was motivated by malice. Asked if she believed her daughter’s treatment at the hands of the RSPCA could have contributed to her suicide, Mrs Newport said: ‘We will never know. I’m  not going to get into an argument with the RSPCA – they are much bigger than I am.’ The RSPCA said: ‘Our thoughts are with the family and friends of Dawn Aubrey-Ward. Her death and the circumstances surrounding it are tragic and it would not be appropriate for us to comment further.’","Miss Aubrey-Ward helped The Mail on Sunday reveal the charity destroyed thousands of animals .

"A French teenager who was sentenced for biting a police officer while being arrested for wearing a niqab has appeared in court at her appeal hearing with the veil on. Louise-Marie Suisse was stopped by two police officers near a mosque in the centre of Marseille in late July, for wearing a niqab - full-face veil - in breach of a ban introduced in 2011. The court heard the 18-year-old refused to cooperate with the police when asked to produce identity papers. Appeal: Louise-Marie Suisse, a French teenager who was sentenced for biting a police officer while being arrested for wearing a niqab has appeared in court at her appeal hearing with the veil on . Banned: Louise-Marie Suisse was stopped by two police officers near a mosque in the centre of Marseille in late July, for wearing a niqab - full-face veil - in breach of a ban introduced in 2011 . France has outraged many Muslims with . its law against full veils, which came into force in April 2011 and . bans covering a person's face in public. Violations are punishable by a fine of up to 150 euros (£128) or mandatory citizenship training. Police have four hours to consider whether an offender should be fined. The ban includes all garments which cover the eyes, although scarves, hats, and sunglasses are excluded. As . well as a mosque, Muslims are able to put on a veil in the privacy of . their own homes, a hotel room, or a car as long as they are not . driving. She admitted biting one of the officers during an altercation. The prosecutor had pushed for a six-month suspended sentence but the judge went further. He gave Suisse a six-month jail sentence to be suspended after four months. Suisse turned up for the original hearing in 2012 in a full-body black niqab, but with her face uncovered. France has outraged many Muslims with its law against full veils, which came into force in April 2011 and bans covering a person's face in public. Violations are punishable by a fine of up to 150 euros (£128) or mandatory citizenship training. Police have four hours to consider whether an offender should be fined. The ban includes all garments which cover the eyes, although scarves, hats, and sunglasses are excluded. Fined: Despite protests, seen here in 2010, under a law which came into force in 2011, women found guilty of wearing niqabs in public can be fined the equivalent of around £130 . As well as a mosque, Muslims are able . to put on a veil in the privacy of their own homes, a hotel room, or . even a car, as long as they are not driving. Affront: Nicolas Sarkozy had described Muslim face coverings as an affront to the principles of the French Republic . While French women face the fines and . civic duty guidance if they break the law, men who force their wives or . daughters to wear burkas face up to a year in prison, and fines of up . to £25,000. In March, a Frenchman who ripped a Muslim woman's veil off her eyes was given a five-month suspended prison sentence. The 30-year-old, who cannot be named for legal reasons, said he was merely trying to 'enforce' his country's laws when he carried out the attack in the city of Nantes. He approached the woman in a fairground in September last year and pulled away the veil. A judgment against him released by the Nantes criminal court said: 'Ordinary citizens are not entitled to take the law into their own hands.' The man, who originally gave a false identity to police, said he was a firm believer in the law brought in by government of former President, Nicolas Sarkozy. But the judge said that he had acted like a 'vigilante' and carried out the attack solely because he was prejudiced against the women's faith. Sarkozy had described Muslim face coverings as an affront to the principles of . the French Republic, saying that they could be used by both shoplifters . and terrorists to hide their own identities .

"A jury in the phone hacking trial of former News International chief executive Rebekah Brooks and Downing Street spin doctor Andy Coulson will be chosen today. Potential jurors were yesterday warned they faced ‘significant disruption’ to their personal and professional lives because the trial is expected to last up to six months, until next Easter. They were told not to carry out their own research into the high-profile case, or to use Twitter or other social networking sites to discuss it. Trial date: Rebekah Brooks and Andy Coulson pictured arriving at the Old Bailey today for the first day of their trial over charges linked to phone hacking and alleged corrupt payments . From left to right are the defendants in the dock at the Old Bailey: Ian Edmondson, Rebekah Brooks, Andy Coulson, Paul Kuttner, Clive Goodman, Cheryl Carter, Charlie Brooks and Mark Hanna . Brooks and Coulson, both 45, watched silently from the glass-walled dock of the Old Bailey as a panel of potential jurors were given the barest details of the allegations against them and six other defendants. The trial is expected to be one of the longest in recent British legal history. A group of 80 potential jurors were gathered in a bid to find 12 who could hear the case in its entirety. Charges: Rebekah Brooks, pictured arriving at the Old Bailey with her husband Charlie today, also faces allegations of attempting to pervert the course of justice . Lengthy: The trial of Rebekah Brooks, pictured surrounded by photographers outside the Old Bailey today, is expected to take more than five months . The trial into phone hacking will see some of the country’s top legal minds go head-to-head in the courtroom with costs expected to run into millions of pounds. Andrew Edis QC will be leading the . prosecution against the defendants. He is already well-known for heading the successful prosecution . earlier this year of Chris Huhne and his ex-wife Vicky Pryce for . conspiracy to pervert the course of justice over a 2003 driving case. He has also worked on a string of . high-profile murder cases - including the ‘lady in the lake’ case where . Gordon Park was found guilty of killing his wife 30 years after dumping . her body. He will face Jonathan Laidlaw QC who works in the same chambers off Fleet Street and is the lead counsel for Rebekah Brooks. He predominantly practices in fraud and business law and has successfully represented numerous companies and their directors against cahrges brought by the Health and Safety Executive. Meanwhile Timothy Langdale QC, known for his presence in the court room, will be representing Coulson. Defence QCs usually earn about £850-an-hour and often have up to seven juniors assisting them at £400-an-hour. This means a five-month trial with a . minimum of six hours a day in court could result in a total defence bill . of £4.4million for the case alone. The cost to the public purse of the . case - which includes the use of a court room for several months, taking up the time of court staff and a judge, as well as the prosecution fees - is also expected to . run into the hundreds of thousands of pounds. Judge Mr Justice Saunders told them: . ‘To sit on a jury for this long is a significant disruption to people’s . lives and we do appreciate that.’ Of the 80 potential jurors, 48 were excused because of commitments including holidays or work. From the remaining 32, 12 will be . chosen at random today to serve as the jury. The prosecution will then . open its case. Brooks and Coulson, both former editors of the News of . the World, are accused of being part of a six-year conspiracy to hack . phones of celebrities, politicians and public figures at the now defunct . Sunday tabloid. The . paper’s former head of news Ian Edmondson, 44, and its ex-managing . editor Stuart Kuttner, 73, allegedly conspired with them to illegally . access voicemails between October 2000 and August 2006. All four deny . the charges. Brooks, . who resigned from News International in July 2011, denies charges . relating to phone hacking, conspiracy to commit misconduct in public . office and conspiracy to pervert the course of justice. Coulson, who quit his role working for David Cameron in Downing Street in January 2011, faces charges relating  to his time at the News of the World. He denies the phone hacking accusation and  two charges of conspiracy  to commit misconduct in  public office. The newspaper’s former royal editor, Clive Goodman, 56, has also pleaded not guilty to conspiracy to commit misconduct in public office. Brooks’s husband, racehorse trainer Charlie Brooks, 50, denies conspiring to pervert the course of justice, as does her former assistant Cheryl Carter, 49, and News International’s ex-head of security Mark Hanna, 50. Clive Goodman, former News of the World royal editor, pictured left, and Stuart Kuttner, former News of the World managing editor, pictured right, arrives for the first day of the phone-hacking trial at the Old Bailey . In court: Cheryl Carter, former personal assistant to Rebekah Brooks, also arrived at the court for the start of the trial this morning . Rebekah Brooks between January 1, 2004, and January 31, 2012, conspired with others and persons unknown to commit misconduct in public office. Brooks, between February 9, 2006, and October 16, 2008, conspired with others and with persons unknown to commit misconduct in public office. Conspiring to pervert the course of justice: Brooks and Cheryl Carter between July 6, 2011, and July 9, 2011, conspired together to do a series of acts which had a tendency to and were intended to pervert the course of public justice, namely permanently to remove seven boxes of archived material from the archive of News International. Rebekah Brooks, Charles Brooks and Mark Hanna, between July 15, 2011, and July 19, 2011, conspired together and with others and persons unknown to do an act or a series of acts which had a tendency to and were intended to pervert the course of justice, namely to conceal documents, computers, and other electronic equipment from officers of the Metropolitan police who were investigating allegations of phone hacking and corruption of public officials in relation to the News of the World and The Sun newspapers.

"The NHS is paralysed by a Mafia-style code of silence that stops whistleblowers highlighting poor care, MPs were told last night. Even senior surgeons fear drawing attention to dangers to patients in case it should damage their career. David Prior, the chairman of the Care Quality Commission watchdog, said there was a ‘chilling’ culture in NHS hospitals that discouraged potential whistleblowers from breaking ranks. Concern: David Prior, the chairman of the Care Quality Commission, told the Commons health select committee there was a 'chilling' culture in NHS hospitals that discouraged potential whistleblowers from breaking ranks . Medics who wish to expose failing hospitals have to be ‘very, very brave’, he told a Commons committee. He said senior doctors’ career prospects had been ruined after they dared to speak out. There have been a series of scandals involving whistleblowers whose concerns were covered up by an NHS keen to sweep poor care under the carpet. Campaigner Julie Bailey was ignored when she campaigned about poor standards at Mid Staffordshire NHS trust, where up to 1,200 died needlessly from neglect in appalling conditions. Hundreds of former NHS staff are under gagging orders to ensure they did not speak out about poor care. Highlighting the need to break down the NHS’s ‘tribal’ culture of banning criticism, Mr Prior told the Commons health select committee: ‘I have spoken to a couple of surgeons whose careers have been severely limited because they expressed concerns about what was going on at their hospitals.’ He said he had found it ‘chilling’ to . hear a senior clinician ask why doctors did not raise concerns about . unusually high mortality rates and poor care of patients at the . Mid-Staffordshire NHS Trust. Previous stories: The Mail revealed last month that NHS bosses have spent £4million in three years secretly gagging whistleblowers concerned about patient care . ‘For years, this dreadful care went on and no doctor put his head above the parapet,’ he said. ‘Why is that? One part of the answer is that they are frightened. ‘Even if you are an alpha-male surgeon, you are frightened. We might feel that’s not good enough, but that is the situation.’ 'For years, this dreadful care went on and no doctor put his head above the parapet. Why is that? One part of the answer is that they are frightened' David Prior, CQC chairman . Committee member David Tredinnick said NHS trusts operated under ‘omerta’ – the Mafia’s code of silence, adding: ‘It is about organisations closing ranks so tightly that if anyone steps out of line they are finished. ‘It is a kind of Mafia code, an omerta, where you do anything against the status quo of the organisation and you are finished. That is something that surely needs to be broken.’ Joyce Robbins, of the pressure group Patient Concern, said: ‘If you are an innocent patient you will be scared by this. ‘It is horrific to think that doctors know of problems but cannot speak out. We only hear about it when there is a big case like Mid Staffs, but now it seems it is more widespread.’ The Mail revealed last month that NHS . bosses have spent £4million in three years secretly gagging . whistleblowers concerned about patient care. Making herself heard: Campaigner Julie Bailey (pictured with Prime Minister David Cameron) was ignored when she campaigned about poor standards at Mid Staffordshire NHS trust, where up to 1,200 died needlessly . Dozens of doctors, nurses and other staff have been quietly paid off in return for not speaking out. One of them was Gary Walker, former boss of United Lincolnshire Hospitals, who was given £500,000 to leave quietly after repeatedly warning that targets were being put ahead of patients. He received the hush money to prevent him going public with his fears that the ‘target culture’ at the trust could cost lives. 'It is a kind of Mafia code, an omerta, where you do anything against the status quo of the organisation and you are finished. That is something that surely needs to be broken' David Tredinnick, Commons health select committee member . As many as 500 patients may have died needlessly because of poor care – but his concerns were ignored, and he said he was ‘thrown to the wolves’ for speaking out. The new leadership of the Care Quality Commission want to make it easier for doctors and nurses to trigger inspections of their hospitals by coming to them with concerns about patient safety. Mr Prior and chief executive David Behan were appointed within the past year to lead a shake-up of the CQC after it came in for harsh criticism over its response to scandals including Mid-Staffordshire and Morecambe Bay, where babies died needlessly in maternity units. They told MPs they were bringing in a new . regime of specialist inspections of hospitals, care homes and . surgeries, which will eventually see ratings published not only for each . service but also for individual departments within hospitals. Mr Prior said: ‘How we enable people to raise concerns with us at a much earlier stage in confidence is incredibly important. Answering questions: Mr Prior (left) and chief executive David Behan (right) were appointed within the past year to lead a shake-up of the CQC after it came in for harsh criticism over its response to scandals . ‘We need to get a continuous flow of information from staff and residents and patients and carers. That’s our best source of information. ‘What we have got to do is to be absolutely sure when we do an inspection that hospitals have got proper whistleblowing, concern-raising, procedures within the hospital and that there is real clinical engagement. ‘And we have got to be a safety net and be available to these people at a much earlier stage so they can ring us up, get in touch with us and that can precipitate an inspection.’ Mr Prior acknowledged that the CQC’s new inspection regime was ‘a work in progress’, but said the first 18 inspections would be completed by Christmas, with reports published by February. He and Mr Behan were challenged over their decision to clear head of media Anna Jefferson of wrongdoing over a report into the watchdog’s handling of complaints about maternity unit deaths at Morecambe Bay. An independent report suggested Miss Jefferson was involved in preventing the publication of the results of an internal inquiry because of fears it would damage the watchdog’s reputation. But Mr Prior insisted the report had not come to the conclusion that any individual was guilty. A Labour spokesman said: ‘Labour supports protection for whistleblowers in the NHS. But this Government needs to do more to support frontline NHS staff.’","Even senior surgeons fear drawing attention to dangers to patients .

"The family of a 24-year-old woman not seen since she broke up with her boyfriend in May have spoken out after remains discovered on Saturday were confirmed to be her. Reported missing by her family on May 1, Mandy Matula has been found in a park in Stearns County, MN. She died from a single gunshot would to the head, according to the coroner. Her ex-boyfriend, David Roe, was named as a 'person of interest,' but committed suicide before investigators were able to question him in her disappearance. There had been no trace of her until this weekend. Despite the grim news, her family shared a mixture of sadness and relief at the closure brought by the news and also wanted people to know he was a good person, calling him a 'sweetheart.' Scroll down for video . Mystery: Police have been searching for Mandy Marie Matula (left), since she was last seen with the boyfriend she was believed to have just broken up with David Marshall Roe (right) Not mad: Steven Matula says his family wants people to know that Mr Roe was a good guy, and that the murder-suicide wasn't in his nature . 'She was a very loved daughter, sister and a friend,' brother Steven, 22, wrote on Facebook. 'May Mandy rest in peace, and let her shine through all of us as we go about our daily lives.' The relieved relative then thanked everyone who helped search for his sister before telling his sister he loves her. The grisly discovery was made Saturday at 2pm . today by a hiker at Mississippi River Park, which was searched many times by investigators after Ms Matula went missing. 'We can finally have Mandy at rest, a lot of weight has been taken off my shoulders,' her brother told CBS Minnesota, adding 'we’ve been waiting for this day to come... Mandy is finally coming home.' Mandy's brother also went out of his way to speak well of Mr Roe. He told CBS Minnesota that Mr Roe is a good man, that the murder-suicide wasn't in his character and that people need to know that wasn't the type of person he was, before joining his father in praise of the suspected killer at a press conference. Devastated: Mandy (center right) pictured with mother Lisa (left), brother Steven (center left) and father Wayne . Never stopped searching: Wearing this shirt, Steven Matula never stopped searching for his sister - her being found is a weight off his shoulders, he said . Such a tragedy: Mandy Matula's life ended violently, alone, and in the dark . 'He was such a really good guy,' the 22-year-old told the station. 'He was a sweetheart.' 'Dave was a really good guy overall, brother Steven said of Roe during a Saturday press conference. 'He was well-mannered and was a gentleman. I can't say anything bad about him.' 'He was very cordial to me and was a nice guy,' father Wayne added. There is amazingly no animosity towards the man that killed Mandy Matula from her family. 'The whole family was flabbergasted that Dave did something like this,' brother Steven added. Her grieving father also said during the press conference that he's grateful to bring this horror to end and that the family is planning a funeral. 'To actually see where it took place, it will bring closure,' Wayne Matula shared. 'That’s forever going to be in our hearts.' 'It’s hard, because we waited this long,' friend Leah Foster told the Minneapolis Star Tribune. 'We knew it was coming, but it’s hard when it happens.' Her final resting place: Ms Matula's remains were discovered Saturday by a hiker in Mississippi River Park, in Eden Prairie . Multiple searches: Despite several search efforts in that very park, Mandy Matula's remains went undiscovered since May - until now . They never gave up: The Matula family was actually planning to search the park again this weekend, according to her brother . Mr Matula told KSTP that investigators found a sweatshirt with a University of Minnesota-Duluth logo and the number 14 near the remains. Ms Matula's class ring was also found on the body, according to reports, leading police to believe it was Mandy. She wore number 14 when she played softball at UND, a number synonymous with her throughout her playing career - she was born on January 14, the father added. The county medical examiner confirmed in a Sunday autopsy the remains are those of Ms Matula. She died of a single gunshot wound to the head, a coroner's report cited by KAAL said. All that remains of their beloved Mandy are her bones, the family said during the press conference, there is evidence animals found her corpse. Authorities do not believe she was killed in the park, and think perhaps not even in the surrounding area, but they do not have a location for her death. The park her body was discovered in is over 80 miles from her Duluth home, KAAL noted. Concerned family: Mandy, seen here with brother Steve, told friends and relatives that she had planned to break up with Roe before she went missing . Such promise: Mandy's family grew concerned when she failed to show up to her job Thursday morning . Ms Matula and Mr Roe dated for a while, both were standout athletes in high school and college. He . was all-conference in football while playing for a state championship . team before attending the University of St. Thomas - where he continued . his football career. Mandy worked as a seasonal maintenance worker for the city of Eden . Prairie for more than six years, and she also worked at a family . recreation center in Eden Prairie, Brunswick Zone XL. Mr Roe was the last person to see Ms Matula alive. He told investigators he last saw her at 1:30am on the day she was reported missing. He said she got out of his car. That was all her family had to go on, now they now the rest of the story. Ms Matula's family finally has closure.","Mandy Matula went missing in May, there was no trace of her until Saturday .

"On trial: Former News International chief executive Rebekah Brooks arrives at the Old Bailey yesterday . The phone hacking case has put ‘British justice on trial’, a judge declared yesterday. In an extraordinary address to the jury hearing the case of former News International chief executive Rebekah Brooks and ex-Downing Street spin doctor Andy Coulson, trial judge Mr Justice Saunders stressed that the stakes could not be higher for Britain’s judicial system. ‘In a way it is not only the defendants on trial, it is British justice on trial,’ he said. He made the unprecedented comments as a jury of nine women and three men were sworn in to try Brooks and Coulson, both 45 and both former News of the World editors. They are accused with others of being part of a six-year conspiracy to hack the phones of public figures at the now-defunct Sunday tabloid. Ahead of the case opening later today, the judge issued a lengthy series of instructions to the Old Bailey jury, telling them: ‘I’m going to give you some extremely important directions. ‘They are always important, but they could not be more important than they are in this particular case. ‘It is a central principle of our system of trial by jury that you decide your verdicts on the evidence and arguments you hear in court, and only the evidence and arguments that you hear in court.’ The judge said there had been an unprecedented amount of publicity about the case, some of which was ‘offensive and demeaning’ to some of the defendants. He told them to disregard an inflammatory cover of the current edition of Private Eye featuring Brooks, telling them to ignore what he called a joke ‘in especially bad taste’. Jurors were also told to ignore comment on the case on Twitter and other social media sites. In a dig at celebrity tweeters, he said: ‘Some public figures – well-known actors, musicians, politicians and others – publish blogs and send tweets in which they not only express their views on their own areas of expertise, but also on topics about which they know very little. In the dock: From left, Ian Edmondson, Rebekah Brooks, Andy Coulson, Stuart Kuttner, Clive Goodman, Cheryl Carter, Charlie Brooks and Mark Hanna - their trial is to start today . Hearing: Former News of the World editor Andy Coulson arrives at the Old Bailey in Central London yesterday . Court appearance: Cheryl Carter, the former personal assistant to Rebekah Brooks, arrives at the Old Bailey . ‘I very much hope they will not do so . during the trial. They may well be breaking the law if they do so and . appropriate action will be taken if they do. ‘The . internet is often fuelled by speculation. There has been a great deal . of publicity about the subject matter of this case, perhaps an . unprecedented amount. ‘A significant amount of publicity and speculation has been inaccurate and misleading.

Case: Clive Goodman, the former royal editor at the News of the World, arrives at the Old Bailey yesterday . Arrival: Stuart Kuttner, the former managing editor of the News of the World, outside the Old Bailey yesterday . End of the day: Charlie Brooks and Rebekah Brooks in a taxi as they leave the Old Bailey courthouse last night . ‘Some, particularly on the internet on . Twitter, has been offensive and demeaning to some of the defendants. A . lot of it is ill-informed and most of it is abusive.’ Comments: Mr Justice Saunders said the stakes could not be higher for Britain's judicial system . Jurors were warned they could face jail for contempt of court if they ignored the judge’s directions. Brooks and Coulson allegedly conspired with former News of the World head of news Ian Edmondson, 44, the tabloid’s ex-managing editor Stuart Kuttner, 73, and others to illegally access voicemails between October 2000 and August 2006. Brooks is also charged with conspiring with others to commit misconduct in public office linked to alleged inappropriate payments to public officials. She also faces allegations of conspiracy to pervert the course of justice – one with former personal assistant Cheryl Carter, 49 – over the alleged removal of material from News International. Brooks, her husband Charlie Brooks and former head of security at News International Mark Hanna are also accused of conspiring together to pervert the course of justice. Coulson, David Cameron’s former spin doctor, is also charged with conspiring with the News of the World’s former royal editor, Clive Goodman, 56, to commit misconduct in public office. They all deny the charges. By ROBERT HARDMAN . Shortly after lunch yesterday afternoon, nine women and three men learned that they would be spending most of their days between now and next summer cooped up in Court 12 of the Old Bailey. No mean undertaking. By teatime, it had become a much, much bigger deal than that following Mr Justice Saunders’ grave proclamation that ‘British justice is on trial’ here. You might expect to read that sort of thing in a newspaper headline but not to hear it from the mouth of a distinguished judge. 'Trial of the century': Mr Justice Saunders, with defendants (left to right in the dock) Ian Edmondson, Rebekah Brooks, Andy Coulson, Stuart Kuttner, Clive Goodman, Cheryl Carter, Charlie Brooks and Mark Hanna . Little wonder this has already had the ‘trial of the century’ tag slapped all over it. It’s going to be a dawn start in the queue for the public gallery. This afternoon, the prosecution will start to outline the case against eight defendants including former News International chief executive Rebekah Brooks and former Number Ten communications maestro Andy Coulson. Yesterday, they were all on their feet to . hear the charges. The glass-fronted dock looked more like an executive . box at a rather lugubrious race meeting than a traditional Old Bailey . line-up. This has already had the 'trial of the century' tag slapped all over it. It's going to be a dawn start in the queue for the public gallery . Miss Brooks appeared paler than of late, her famous Titian locks now perhaps a few shades darker than when this all started. Because the defendants must sit according to their position on the court list, she was not next to her husband, Charlie Brooks, who was towards the other end of the dock. Chin-up confident and taking notes on a computer, he managed the occasional smile during some of the opening legal acrobatics. There were so many wigs in the room that I totted up 18 at one point, 20 at another. It was like trying to count sheep. So vast is this assembly of legal expertise that the normal press benches have been allocated to all the solicitors while the press have been given a few chairs behind the ushers. Most of the media were left to follow proceedings by video link three floors below. Charges: Former News of the World editor Rebekah Brooks (centre) and her husband Charlie (right) arrive . Just visible between Mr Brooks and former royal correspondent Clive Goodman was Miss Brooks’s petite former personal assistant, Cheryl Carter. When the defendants were invited to sit, she almost faded from view altogether. Alongside Mr Goodman, the retired managing editor of the News of the World, Stuart Kuttner, was clinging with both hands to the bars between the glass panels as he stood to hear the charges. Statement: By teatime, it had become a much, much bigger deal following Mr Justice Saunders' grave proclamation that 'British justice is on trial' here . Later on, the jury was informed that the  73-year-old would only be present when  specifically required due to ill health. On his right, impassive and smartly-dressed in grey suit, white shirt and pale blue tie, Mr Coulson followed everything intensely. Once or twice, he intervened to ask some of the less audible barristers to speak up during their legal arguments. Such are the complexities of this case that it may be Christmas before we hear from the defendants. But Judge Saunders was taking no chances that these jurors might be swayed – and not just by the inane tweets of clueless celebs. He also warned people sitting in the public gallery – where Murdoch-bashing Labour MP Tom Watson was much in evidence during the day – that they should not display any sort of reaction in front of the jury. Though no details were heard in open court yesterday, the judge even told the jurors to avoid mentioning the case to anyone ‘over a pint’ in the pub on the way home last night. On a more upbeat note, he did at least joke that by the end of this very considerable ‘bonding’ exercise, many of them would be ‘friends for life’. Even veterans of the Bailey were struggling to recall the last time a jury received a set of directions quite like this. As dusk fell on the departing defendants and the camera crews dispersed for another night, a pair of splendid plane trees peered down on the scene from the churchyard of St Sepulchre’s Church. Untroubled by this week’s storms, they are still sporting a full thatch of green leaves. It is a sobering thought that the whole lot will have turned brown, fallen off, moulded away, sprouted anew and grown back all over again by the time this epic reaches its conclusion. Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","Mr Justice Saunders is judge for Rebekah Brooks and Andy Coulson trial .

"'Suspicious' behaviour: A police profile of a suspect in Madeleine McCann's disappearance had a violent past, reported a Portuguese newspaper . The suspected kidnapper of Madeleine McCann died in a tractor accident four years ago, it was claimed yesterday. The 40-year-old was a former employee at the Ocean Club holiday resort where the McCann family was staying and might have snatched Maddie in revenge after being sacked, a Portuguese newspaper reported. Police identified him as their main suspect after mobile phone records indicated he was around the McCanns’ holiday apartment in Praia da Luz when Maddie disappeared on May 3 2007, the paper claimed. The flat is a 15-minute drive from the town of Lagos where the unnamed suspect was living after he stopped working at the Ocean Club. Portuguese detectives fear he killed Madeleine and are said to be searching for her body. Portugal’s Attorney-General gave the go-ahead for  the investigation into the  girl’s disappearance to be reopened last week at the request of the local police, the Policia Judiciaria – more than five years after the original inquiry was shelved. The Portuguese daily Correio da Manha claimed: ‘Police suspicions about the former Ocean Club employee arose during the review of the case carried out by a PJ team from Porto. ‘This was the strongest new lead presented to state prosecutors which led to the investigation being reopened. Motive: The man was reportedly a former employee of the Ocean Club in Praia Da Luz, pictured, where Madeleine McCann disappeared in May 2007 . ‘The man, who died aged 40 in a tractor accident in 2009, was not on the list of employees handed over to police during the initial investigation by the Ocean Club because at the time of Madeleine’s disappearance he was not working there.’ It described his departure from the Ocean Club as ‘frictious’ and said: ‘The motives that could have caused the ex-employee to kidnap the youngster are still being investigated.’ It suggests that he may ‘have committed the kidnap as a form of retaliation against the Ocean Club. His aim could have been to call into question the security of the holiday club but something went wrong and the youngster disappeared.’ Portuguese police and a spokesman for the McCanns declined to comment on the newspaper report yesterday. It was written by three journalists including a senior reporter who gave evidence recently at the ongoing libel case brought by Kate and Gerry McCann against Goncalo Amaral, the officer in charge of the original investigation, over a book he wrote that accuses them of faking Madeleine’s abduction to cover up her death. Hope: The McCann's lawyer said that the couple, seen here with a computer generated image of how Madeleine might have looked in 2012, are still motivated by the belief that she is still alive . It emerged over the weekend that police were planning to reinterview several Ocean Club employees. More than 130 workers were questioned during the initial inquiry, including two men who fixed a blind in the McCanns’ apartment two days before Madeleine disappeared. Portuguese police are thought to have returned to the Praia da Luz area about a month ago to carry out mobile phone tracking work. Last week it emerged that Kate and Gerry McCann are to apply under Portuguese law to become private ‘prosecutors’ and may now be able to influence the course of the investigation and any prosecution . Their status as ‘assistentes’ will allow their legal team  to work alongside state prosecutors, keeping the McCanns informed of all new developments in the case. They could also bring a parallel private prosecution against any suspects charged over Maddie’s disappearance. A secrecy order put on the case by Portugal’s Attorney General could also be lifted just for them, giving access to all case files.

Should the cigarette purchase age be raised from 18 to 21? The bill's approval was first reported by WABC, it was first announced in April by City Council Speaker Christine Quinn and Health Commissioner Thomas Farley . ’The more difficult it is for [young people] to gain access to tobacco products, the less likely they are to start smoking, Ms Quinn said while announcing the bill. Ms Quinn, a former mayoral candidate took the lead on this initiative, one that was originally opposed by Mayor Michael Bloomberg, the Daily News noted. It was originally proposed by Councilman James Gennaro. 'This, I believe, is the next big thing for the city, and hopefully for the state and for the country,' the proposal's sponsor, Mr Gennaro, said before Wednesday's vote. The bill also includes electronic cigarettes, according to CBS New York, which reported it cites a recent Centers for Disease Control report that showed an increasing number of high school students trying the smokeless cigarettes. Let's take a vote: New York City Council Speaker Christine Quinn speaks during an April news conference to announce the legislation to increase the minimum age for buying cigarettes to 21 . Official statistics cited by NBC New . York show that 80 per cent of New York smokers started before age 21, . with 20,000 city high schoolers currently puffing away – and many of . them under 18-years-old. By raising the legal smoking age to 21, bill advocates have argued, minors with older friends will have a harder time finding people to buy them cigarettes. The majority of those asked to buy smokes for minors are under the age of 21, officials said.Critics have lampooned the idea, pointing to the easy access minors have to alcohol. ‘I’m pre-med. I should not be smoking,’ Poli Ivanova, 20, told the New York Daily News. ‘History has shown you can’t stop people even if you move the age to 21. Kids still drink and get alcohol even when they are under 21.’ A growing number of towns and cities across the country are raising their minimum tobacco purchase ages. The tobacco-buying age is 21 in Needham, MA., and is poised to rise to 21 in January in nearby Canton. The state of New Jersey is considering a similar proposal, and the idea has been floated in other places, including the Texas Legislature. ‘It’s not going to work,’ another minor told the paper. ‘Cigarettes are like food, getting your hands on them is easy.’ Brookline, MA., recently raised it's legal tobacco age to 19-years-old, reports said. No worries: Minors say they have no problem getting cigarettes and will still be able to get them if the age to buy is raised . An unintended consequence of this bill, should it become law, is less business for bodega and newsstand owners. ‘It’s bad, we’re barely moving cartons now,’ a deli manager told the paper. ‘We’ll be down to selling 3 to 4 packs a day. Our business is young people: the 18-year-olds, the college kids.’ ‘I don’t know what we’re going to do.’ Stores found violating the new law would be fined $1,000 for the first violation each day, and as much as $2,000 for a second violation, according to CBS New York. Licenses to sell tobacco could also be revoked for repeat offenders. New York has been at the forefront of the effort to curb smoking during Mr Bloomberg's three terms in office. The mayor proposed in March to require shops to keep tobacco products in cabinets, drawers, under the counter, behind a curtain or in other concealed spots until a customer asked for them. He said the displays 'invite young people to experiment with tobacco.' The measure ultimately failed, but that did not deter hizzoner from trying a different approach. This latest effort to keep cigarettes out of the hand of teenagers is expected to go into effect early next year. The city banned indoor smoking in 2003, ahead of all cities and states but California. Until recently it also had the country's highest taxes on smokes - Chicago just enacted the highest 'sin tax' in the country.","A bill to raise the legal age to buy cigarettes was voted into law Wednesday by the City Council .
New York is the largest US city to raise the purchase age above the federal limit of 18-years-old .
The law is expected to go into effect early next year .
Critics argue it will not make any difference to minors wanting to smoke, and that it will also hurt businesses ."
"Guns, cash, trucks and smiles - a day in the life of a Mexican drug cartel. Scores of pictures posted to Facebook by cartel members on both official . cartel pages and personal pages, many with massive quantities of drugs, . firearms and bizarre selfies, promote the cartel lifestyle. First reported by Vice, the pages are public and show the dangerous and strange side of cartels. Say cheese: A cartel member appears to pout for the camera . More guns: Cartel members love to show off their guns . He loves the camera: This cartel member has a plethora of selfies . As quickly as pages are deactivated by Facebook, they reappear with the same song and dance – drugs and guns, girls and trucks. Cartels have also begun to use social media to promote a more positive image, according to an analyst that spoke with the site. ‘They advertise their activities, they conduct public relations initiatives, and they have basically turned themselves into their own media company,’ said Antoine Nouvet. These pictures broadcast the drug cartel lifestyle to a captive audience, Mr Nouvet argued, which also helps the gangs’ recruiting efforts. Fill'er up!: This SUV is packed ceiling to roof with marijuana . Locked and loaded: Cartel members show off their fancy firearms, including this one made of gold . He's a lover and a fighter: Cartel members switch effortlessly between hugging women and firearms . Serious firepower: The most prolific of the Broly Banderas posters is holding what looks like either an RPG or a rocket launcher . Ready for war: The cartels are armed to the teeth . It also helps in the public arena – by broadcasting a positive persona, the cartels can attempt to argue they are not as bad as authorities claim. A video showing the Gulf Cartel providing relief in the form of food, water and other aid to locals devastated by Hurricane Ingrid has nearly 500,000 views. An august diatribe by ‘La Tuta,’ the leader of the Knights of Templar cartel has almost 1million views on YouTube. By comparison, Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto’s State of the Union address has less than 16,000 views. A now-banned Facebook page run by the Caballeros Templarios was advertised as a small business and had more than 10,000 likes before it was taken down, Vice noted. In its place has sprung up the profile of Broly, a prominent member of the gang with an insatiable appetite for selfies. Girls just wanna have fun: Not content to let the men get all the action, these ladies suit up . Ready to go: Some people may see the endless supply of cash and guns as glamorous, they are part of the cartels' target audience . Loaded: Many cartel pictures just show piles of cash . Cartel selfies: The Broly Banderas show off yet another firearm . Broly, the most prominent member on social media, has a bizarre cadre of selfies with guns or pouting or pouting with guns. Also uncovered by MailOnline is the prolific use of file photos meant to make the cartel life look more dramatic. Many pictures of massive firearms, men with ski masks, ski mask-wearing snipers with massive firearms and others, all turned up as stock images. Does it get any better?: Guns, cash, funs and smiles - the life of Mexican drug cartel . Who ya gonna call: The Broly Banderas mug for the camera . Armed to the teeth: Mexican drug cartels appear to have a limitless supply of guns and ammo . Cash money: The cartels have as much money as they do guns - which means they have a lot of both . The cartels are using file photos of highly trained military personnel to either strike fear into adversaries or to brag to their less internet savvy admirers. Despite employing an army of analysts and computer engineers – either paid or against their will, according to Vice – their embrace of social media will likely lead to their downfall, Mr Nouvet told Vice . ‘Technology that benefits the cartels suddenly turns out to be one of their key vulnerabilities,’ said the expert, ‘And that could be the case in Mexico if the government adopts better skills and laws to counter them in cyberspace.’ Until then, a look into the strange life of a Mexican drug cartel is there for all to see.","The infamous drug gangs post across a wide variety of sites, including Facebook and YouTube .
The cartels post pictures of money and women, trucks and guns, as well as videos of speeches by leaders .
They also use file photos of gun arsenals and snipers, in a sense bluffing about their capabilities ."
"A new study describes the pitfalls of texting in relationships -- including the fact it can prevent understanding your partner's feelings face-to-face. Lori Schade and Jonathan Sandberg at Brigham Young University (BYU) followed the texting habits of 276 young adults. 38 percent were in a serious relationship, 46 percent were engaged, and 16 percent were married. Schade, a therapist, told U.S. News & World Report that her patients tell her how strongly they receive messages. She said they show her texts and 'can feel the emotion.' Better to give than to receive: the study found sending loving texts was better linked to relationship satisfaction than receiving them . For both men and women, sending . loving text messages was linked to relationship satisfaction -- even more so than receiving them, a press release from BYU says. Texting may also be useful for couples' 'relationship maintenance.' However, the authors warn that 'texting is devoid of important face-to-face cues' and can facilitate miscommunication, AllthingsD notes. 'There is a narrowness with texting and you don’t get to see the breadth of a person that you need to see,' Sandberg said in the release. The release also describes several sources for lovers' digital dissatisfaction -- which may translate to in-person problems. Women's texts that attempt to solve relationship issues and handle differences, they say, are linked to lower relationship quality. Men, they noted, may feel less satisfied when they send the majority of messages. Receiving 'frequent' texts was also linked to lower relationship quality. 'We're wondering if this means men disconnect and replace in-person conversations with more texting,' Schade said in the release. 'Maybe as they exit the relationship, they text more frequently because that's a safer form of communication. We don't know why, that is just a conjecture.' For women, using texts to solver relationship issues is associated with lower relationship quality, researchers say .","'You don't get to see the breadth of a person you need to see,' researcher Lori Schade says .

"A new list out Tuesday reveals that America’s wealth isn’t just for the coastal elite by showing just how rich each state’s most monied top dog really is. From Hawaii, where real estate mogul Jay Shidler reigns supreme to Maine, where L.L. Bean chairman Leon Gorman looks out onto his outerwear empire, these are the richest in each. And while the ten richest, topped again by Washington’s Bill Gates and his $70.8 billion, haven’t changed since last year, their wealth certainly has. Scroll down for full list... Washington & America's richest: Bill Gates remains America's richest person. He also hails from the Washington, making him the Evergreen State's wealthiest individual . Pricey pad: The Microsoft founder's compound in Washington state was built with all the fanciest gadgetry, took 7 years to construct and cost over $60 million . Despite a sluggish economy, these elite among the elite are making even more this year than last. Together, their combined $362 billion makes up 67 percent of the combined wealth of all 50 people on the list compiled by wealth analyst firm Wealth-X. The firm wasn’t able to pin all of America’s billionaires and almost theres to a specific state, so for the ones who’ve renounced their citizenships like Dart Container Corp’s Kenneth Dart or only live in their home states in spirit like Walmart heir Jim Walton, they’ve used the person’s primary place of business as a guide. The worth of the wealthiest 7 percent of households in America has gone up by around 28 percent since the financial crisis, reports ABC News. Plainsman: The Oracle of Omaha may not have the most interesting home state, but he's still the richest man in Nebraska . Prairie home: Buffett's Nebraska home is largely unadorned, much like his agricultural home state. But, with $59.8 billion to his name, Warren can certainly afford to vacation elsewhere . Rich people are everywhere, from the more prosperous states like New York--home to New York City's Mayor Michael Bloomberg and his $21.4 billion--to the poorer states like Arkansas, where Walmart heir and bank CEO Jim Walton and his $31.1 billion calls home. Washington Bill Gates: $70.8 billion . Microsoft CEO . Nebraska Warren Buffett: $59.8 billion . Berkshire Hathaway CEO . California Larry Ellison: $46.4 billion . Oracle Corp CEO .

Chairman of Nu Skin Enterprises . Alaska Robert Gillam: $400 million . President and CEO of McKinley Capital Management LLC . Wyoming John Martin: $300 million . Chairman and CEO of Gilead Sciences . The biggest winner of that crisis is also America’s second wealthiest man Warren Buffett, whose current $59.8 billion worth had an unbelieveable $10 billion boost thanks to the Oracle of Omaha’s smart investments while the market slumped in 2008. This means Buffett is literally worth over a million times more than the average yearly household income in his home state of Nebraska, which is a mere $50,000. Less surprising than number 2’s origins on the prairie, is number 3’s home state of California where the Golden State has truly lived up to its name for Oracle Corp’s Larry Ellison. Ellison is currently worth an estimated  $46.4 billion. Easy going: Oracle CEO Larry Ellison is the thrid richest man in America and the richest man in California. Ellison's signature Woodside, California pad is modeled after an ancient Japanese emperor's residence and cost about $70 million. And with his $46.4 billion, he's also somewhat of a collector of homes . Kansan: David Koch is the richest man in Kansas but he's more likely to be seen gallivanting around East Hampton or Palm Beach with his many billions . Clocking in at number 4 is David Koch, half of the noted politically active Koch brothers who hail from the state of Kansas. David’s fortune alone is $41.5 billion. And from one of the poorest states comes the fifth richest American—Walmart heir and CEO of Arvest Bank James Walton, worth $37.1 billion. While his primary residence is listed in Bentonville, Arkansas, Walton is more likely to be seen on the golf courses of Palm Beach, Florida or the Hamptons, where he also owns homes. Equally less at home in his home state, or perhaps more so, is Kenneth Dart, who took his $6.6 billion, renounced his American citizenship, and fled to Belize in 1994. Though, his business holdings peg him as Michigan’s richest man, according to Wealth-X. Sin City: Like the Koch brothers, billionaire Sheldon Adelson has been known to use his money to sway national politics, though he hails predominantly from the state of Nevada, where he owns the Sands hotel . Made of money: Despite being a college drop out from the City College of New York, Adelson has made around $32.2 billion as a casino magnate in Las Vegas, Nevada and around the world .","America's richest man remains Washington State's Bill Gates, who is worth $70.8 billion .
But wealth resides outside the coastal states, with the top ten richest in America also hailing from landlocked Arkansas, Kansas, and Nebraska ."
"Drug mule Melissa Reid is set to see her mother for the first time since being caught trying to smuggle £1.5 million worth of cocaine out of Peru. The 20-year-old is awaiting sentence in a squalid Peruvian jail with Michaella McCollum Connolly, after the pair were stopped in August attempting to board a flight to Spain at Lima International Airport with 24lb of the class-A drug in their suitcases. In September, the British women pleaded guilty to drug trafficking. Scroll down for video . Mother's love: Debbie Reid has flown to Peru to see her daughter Melissa, who is waiting to be sentenced for drug trafficking. Melissa, and another young woman Michaella McCollum Connolly, were caught trying to smuggle £1.5m worth of cocaine out of Peru . Debbie Reid hasn’t seen her daughter since July, when the then teenager left the family home in Lenzie, near Glasgow, for the party island Ibiza. But on Friday night Debbie arrived in Lima with her husband William, ready to visit Melissa behind bars. Last night, in an exclusive interview with The Mail on Sunday, Debbie said: ‘I can’t wait to see her. To speak to her on the phone has been lovely but to see her in person – to hold her, just to touch her – will be so different. Limbo: Melissa Reid is awaiting sentence at the Virgen de Fatima jail. The minimum possible jail term is six years eight months . ‘I always thought she was so grown up but everything that’s happened has changed that. ‘This situation has made her feel like my baby daughter again – I’m mummy instead of mum. ‘I feel as if we’re in limbo waiting for the sentence. ‘When it does come, at least we will have something to aim for.’ Melissa’s parents have brought their daughter gifts and letters from family and friends including a doll hand-knitted by Melissa’s grandmother, and a customised pillow with pictures of her friends printed on it. Melissa and Michaella, also 20, are waiting to hear what their sentence will be. The minimum possible jail term is six years eight months. If they had pleaded not guilty and been convicted, they could have  been sentenced to up to 15 years’ imprisonment. The pair, who both worked in Ibiza this summer, share a cramped cell with 38 other prisoners and have to endure freezing showers at Virgen de Fatima jail, where they are the only foreign inmates. In a recent diary entry, Melissa revealed her struggle to come to terms with her ordeal, including being so far away from her sisters – twins who have just turned 19. ‘Today was my little twin sisters’ birthday,’ she wrote. ‘This is the first milestone that I have missed within my family for being in this nightmare! 'The ten-minute phone calls are never enough but especially when all I want to do is sing “happy birthday to you” a million times to them! ‘It feels like only yesterday that the three of us were being mistaken for triplets playing innocently and being young kids! 'And now their big sister is half way across the world in prison – if only I could rewind back time to be young again!’ In a bizarre twist, Melissa is being bombarded with letters from prisoners in the UK and Ireland trying to befriend her.

"The Duke of Cambridge marked Remembrance Sunday with a deeply personal note dedicated to two of his friends killed in Iraq and Afghanistan. His touching message was attached to a large poppy wreath he placed at the Cenotaph as he joined the Queen and Prince Harry at the memorial service. It read: ‘For Jo, Lex and all those who have made the ultimate sacrifice for our country.’ Honour: Prince William lays a wreath at the annual Remembrance Sunday ceremony at the Cenotaph . The Duke was referring to Joanna Dyer, a 2nd lieutenant who trained alongside him, and Major Alexis Roberts, who was his platoon commander and mentor at Sandhurst. Major Roberts was killed in October 2007 when his armoured vehicle hit an improvised explosive device in Helmand Province, Afghanistan. The married father-of-two, 32, who was serving with the 1st Battalion The Royal Gurkha Rifles, had been in charge of a 30-vehicle convoy negotiating a road nicknamed ‘IED alley’ when his Vector armed vehicle exploded. Deeply personal: The message from William read: 'For Jo, Lex and all those who have the ultimate sacrifice for our country' At the time, the Duke issued a tribute saying he was ‘deeply saddened’ by the death of his ‘good friend’. Lieutenant Dyer, 24, of the Intelligence Corps, was also killed when her convoy was hit by an explosion. Her Warrior vehicle was destroyed by a ‘colossal’ bomb in Basra, Iraq, in April 2007. Three other soldiers, Corporal Kris O’Neill, 27, Private Eleanor Dlugosz, 19, and Kingsman Adam Smith, 19, were also killed, as well as a civilian interpreter. Fallen friends: Major Alexis Roberts (left) was killed in October 2007 when his vehicle hit a an IED and Joanna Dyer, who trained alongside William, died in 2007 after her vehicle was struck by a bomb in Basra, Iraq .

"Britain’s population is soaring by more than any other country in the European Union and a third of the increase is caused by immigration. The latest figures from Eurostat show that the number of people in the UK rose by almost three  times the EU average in 2012 with 392,000 more than the year before – putting the total population at 63.888million. More than a third of that increase – 38 per cent or 148,700 people – was down to immigration. The rest was ‘natural change’, with 243,900 more people being born than having died. Getting crowded: Britain is already the most densely populated country in Europe - the population now stands at 63,888,000 . The number of live births in Britain was . 813,000 in 2012, the second highest number in Europe, to France where . 822,000 were born. And in Germany, the number of people dying in 2012 outnumbered births by almost 200,000. Tory rebel Adam Afriyie’s attempts to bring forward a referendum on EU membership ended in humiliation yesterday when just 15 MPs voted for it. His amendment would have forced Britons to the polls on the issue next year – instead of the 2017 date preferred by David Cameron. The millionaire Windsor MP, who ignored a letter from 140 Tory MPs urging him to drop the move, said his defeat would help UKIP. He now backs a 2017 poll suggested in a Bill by Tory backbencher James Wharton – and supported by the Prime Minister. The figures bring the UK's total population to 63,888,000. This very high birth rate does much account for the population growth which is almost three times the EU average. Simon Ross, chief executive of campaign group Population Matters, said the figures represented a growing problem especially given that Britain is already the Europe's most densely populated country. He said: 'England is already Europe’s most densely . populated country. Why should we also have Europe’s highest population . growth rate? More people make things worse, . 'If we are serious about tackling the many issues we face as a society, we need to address one of the principal underlying causes, which is population growth.' The second fastest growing EU country is France with 305,500 more people in 2012, 82 per cent of which were accounted for by a rise in births - their total population now stands at 65,633,200. Rising tensions: Coverage of groups of Romanians camping in London's parks provoked fresh debate over the role of immigrants in what many feel is already and overcrowded country . While immigration is a major political controversy in Britain, the increase in population caused by new immigrants arriving of just under 149,000 was less than half of the immigrants entering Germany, 391,000 and in Italy, 369,00. Many point out that without immigration, the EU’s total population would be stagnant or in decline - it grew by just over one million people in 2012, 882,000 of whom were migrants. One cause for  continued migration is the economic crisis in the eurozone which has led to a contraction in the population of some countries as the young and unemployed move elsewhere to improve their chances in life. Emigration was highest in Ireland during 2012, where 35,000 people left the country. High rates of emigration were also recorded in Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia, Greece, Portugal, and Spain.","One third of the increase was down to immigrants but the other cause is that  243,900 more babies were born last year than people died .

"The Yorkshire Building Society's 36 deals mean borrowers will need to save a deposit of £8,500 to buy a home at £170,000 . The number of 95 per cent  mortgage deals on the market will surge today when one of  Britain’s biggest building societies unveils 36 different offers. The Yorkshire Building Society’s deals mean borrowers will need to save a deposit of just £8,500 to buy an average-priced house at £170,000. However, such loans are controversial because experts believe they contributed to the credit crunch by allowing people to borrow more than they could afford. Banks stopped offering them during . the financial crisis, forcing first-time buyers to find a deposit of . around 20 per cent – or £34,000 for the average house. Until today, Yorkshire insisted on a minimum deposit of ten per cent after scrapping 95 per cent mortgages in April 2008. Last . night, experts said the move would encourage more banks and building . societies to offer the deals. Rivals HSBC, Santander and Barclays are . already set to launch 95 per cent mortgages within weeks. David . Hollingworth, of independent mortgage adviser London & Country, . said: ‘They are making quite a splash. They are not just dipping their . toe into the market.’ In August 2007, the month that the credit crunch struck, there were 986 mortgage deals requiring a deposit of only five per cent, according to financial information firm Moneyfacts. Last month, there were just 42. Yesterday, there were 64 and today there will be 100. The move by the Yorkshire comes weeks after the Government launched its Help to Buy scheme, which allows people to buy a home with a five per cent deposit, with the Government providing a guarantee to the lender of up to 15 per cent of the loan. Two banks bailed out by the taxpayer, . Royal Bank of Scotland and Lloyds, have signed up. Until today, the best . 95 per cent deal was with RBS, which owns NatWest, which has a . two-year, fee-free, fixed-rate mortgage at 4.99 per cent. The new deals are available through various Yorkshire subsidiaries: the building society itself, Barnsley Building Society, Chelsea Building Society, Norwich & Peterborough and Accord Mortgages. Yorkshire, which is Britain’s second-largest building society with 3.5million customers, has not joined the scheme and chief executive Chris Pilling said: ‘Our fundamental role as a building society is to support as many people as possible to achieve their aspirations to buy their own home.’ He said it was vital that loans were made in a ‘responsible and prudent way’. The Yorkshire Building Society's rivals HSBC, Santander and Barclays are already set to launch 95 per cent mortgages within weeks . However, Duncan Stott, from the campaign group Priced Out, said: ‘Small deposits mean huge amounts of debt need to be taken out to afford the UK’s sky-high house prices. ‘This is the last thing that Britain needs. The danger is that this will cause even more debt to flow into the housing market, pushing house prices up even further.’ Estate agents Savills has predicted that house prices will rise by a third over the next five years, in part because of the Help to Buy scheme and critics warn it is dangerous to push up prices by helping people on to or up the housing ladder without a dramatic increase in the number of homes being built. The Yorkshire Building Society brands' deals add to the increasing competition in the . low deposit mortgage market, writes This is Money editor Simon Lambert. This has been opened up both by the Government’s . Help to Buy mortgage guarantee scheme and cheap money being pumped through banks and building societies to borrowers through the Funding for Lending scheme. Potential homeowners planning to take advantage of any of these new deals need to remember that both the Bank of England base rate and mortgage interest rates are at historically low levels. Both will rise over the life of their home loan - making monthly payments more expensive. Despite the renewed competition, rates on small deposit mortgages remain high compared to those where homeowners can put down a big deposit. The lowest two-year fix for a five per cent deposit in this range is Yorkshire BS' 4.69 per cent deal, whereas HSBC will offer a borrower with a 40 per cent deposit a rate of just 1.49 per cent. Yorkshire BS will offer a 5 per cent deposit borrower a five-year fixed rate mortgage at 5.09 per cent, which compares to its own rate of just 2.69 per cent for a borrower with a 35 per cent deposit. But compared to the still relatively limited number of 5 per cent deposit mortgages on offer, the Yorkshire BS brands rates look good. They beat the Help to Buy rates offered so far by Halifax and RBS / NatWest across two and five year fixes. However, hopeful homebuyers tempted by the idea of a 5 per cent deposit mortgage will welcome the extra choice, they may find themselves somewhat baffled by the bewildering array of rate and fee combinations and features such as cashback across the Yorkshire brands. As a rough guide, This is Money has crunched the numbers to reveal the best of the 5 per cent deposit mortgages. Potential borrowers can also use our True Cost Mortgage Calculator to work out their own combinations of interest rates and fees.","Yorkshire Building Society's deals mean borrowers will need to save a deposit of £8,500 to buy an average-priced home at £170,000 .

"A Transportation Security Administration officer killed by a gunman at Los Angeles International Airport was shot 12 times, with bullets grazing his heart and piercing his bladder and intestines, according to an autopsy report released Friday. Gerardo Hernandez had more than 40 bullet fragments in his body from the Nov. 1 shooting, the Los Angeles County coroner's office said. He was in full cardiac arrest when he arrived at Harbor-UCLA Medical Center. Doctors tried to repair damage to his heart with an emergency surgical procedure and twice used electricity to stimulate his heart before resorting to 'internal cardiac massage,' the report said. Gerardo Hernandez, 39, was shot 12 times, with bullets grazing his heart and piercing his bladder and intestines, according to an autopsy report released Friday . Exploratory surgery in Hernandez's abdomen revealed massive injuries. He was declared dead 45 minutes after arriving at the hospital and nearly two hours after the shooting. Earlier in the week, the coroner's office released preliminary findings and said Hernandez, 39, died within two to five minutes of being shot. Assistant Chief Coroner Ed Winter explained why the official time of death was much later than his office's finding, which was not included in the final report. Doctors were trying to 'bring him back,' he said. 'They were doing their damndest to try to save his life. Hats off to them,' Winter said. Police stand by the scene of the shooting on November 1. For 28 minutes after the gunman was apprehended, Gerardo Hernandez still lay on the ground as paramedics waited to enter the airport terminal . 'Honestly, I would hope that they would work on anybody if they're not sure. But he was gone.' Authorities have said Paul Ciancia, 23, had a vendetta against the federal government and was targeting TSA officers when he pulled a semi-automatic rifle from a bag and shot Hernandez. Two other TSA employees and an airline passenger were wounded before airport police shot Ciancia. The Associated Press previously reported that Hernandez lay on the floor for 33 minutes before he was rushed to an ambulance outside, even though Ciancia had been subdued within five minutes. The lack of quicker aid at the airport prompted the head of the TSA officers' union, J. David Cox Sr., to say he was appalled, and a local union official said a more timely response might have saved Hernandez's life. Shooter: Paul Ciancia, 23, allegedly targeted TSA agents for being 'unconstitutional'. He could face the death penalty if convicted of a federal murder charge . Several agencies are investigating the response to the incident, including whether paramedics should have been allowed into the terminal sooner to attend to the wounded. The Los Angeles Police Department is investigating whether one of its officers improperly told other responders that Hernandez was dead when he checked on him five minutes after the shooting. Ciancia, who was released from the hospital this week, has been charged with murder. He could face the death penalty if convicted.","Gerardo Hernandez, 39, was fatally shot in the chest on November 1 .

"Two Italian sisters who worked for  Nigella Lawson and Charles Saatchi during their marriage were yesterday in court accused of stealing almost £700,000 from the pair. Astonishingly, the couple’s suspicions were aroused only when the women’s expenditure on household credit cards rocketed from £10,000 to £50,000 a month, the court heard. It is claimed Elisabetta and Francesca Grillo had been lavishly spending for years – on everything from expensive hotels and designer shopping to costly flights and taxi journeys – before they were rumbled. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Accused: Italian sisters Elisabetta Grillo (centre) and Francesca (right) spent £685,000 on their company credit cards, the jury was told . At first Miss Lawson and Mr Saatchi . were willing to keep employing the sisters while they paid the money . back, but called the police when the girls rejected the offer. Francesca . even told Mr Saatchi ‘it would be humiliating to live in the house on . less pay and she would rather go to jail’. Opening . the £685,000 case, prosecutor Jane Carpenter QC told a jury of five . women and seven men at Isleworth crown court in west London that the . case was not about Mr Saatchi’s claims his ex-wife was a cocaine addict, . but about ‘fraud motivated by greed’. Evidence': Charles Saatchi, 70, (pictured) is expected to give prosecution evidence against his two former employees tomorrow. His ex-wife Nigella is likely to enter the witness stand on Friday . Miss . Carpenter said: ‘This trial relates to the high life lived by Francesca . and Elisabetta Grillo – the sort of life you may often see portrayed in . glossy magazines. ‘We say . they did so in a greedy and fraudulent free-for-all, abusing the trust . of their employers in a four-year spending spree.’ Miss Carpenter . claimed Francesca, 35, was the biggest fraudster over the four years, . racking up bills totalling £580,000, while Elisabetta, 41, accounted for . £105,000. Each woman denies a single count of fraud. The pair were previously housed for free by their employers but now live together in Central London after being sacked. Drug claims: Nigella Lawson's former workers will make allegations about her alleged drug use, the jury was told today . They . were initially employed by Miss Lawson, described in court as ‘a . cookery writer’, to ‘ensure the smooth running’ of the household and . help with the children. Francesca was paid £28,000 a year and had worked . for the couple for a decade, while her sister began working for Miss . Lawson and her late husband John Diamond 14 years ago and was paid . £25,000. Both were provided . with Coutts credit cards in their own names on Mr Saatchi’s Conarco . company account. It was made clear, the prosecutor said, that these were . not for personal purchases unless agreed by Miss Lawson or Mr Saatchi. But . the court heard how in June 2012, Mr Saatchi’s company accountant Rahul . Gajjar investigated spending on both cards and found the bills had . risen from ‘£10,000-£20,000 a month to £50,000 a month’. The . investigation found there had been large sums spent on long taxi . journeys and in luxury shops such as Chanel, Louis Vuitton, Miu Miu and . Prada. Miss Carpenter said: ‘There was also regular large cash . withdrawals which made Mr Gajjar more suspicious.’ A . meeting was arranged where both sisters admitted extensive personal . expenditure and were thanked for their honesty, the jury was told, and . Francesca said that she wanted to pay the money back. But at a further . meeting in July last year, the tone changed and both women refused to . continue working on a reduced salary. After a final attempt by Mr Gajjar . to find an amicable solution, in August 2012 the sisters were arrested. Divorce: Nigella Lawson and her ex-husband . Charles Saatchi, 70, are both set to give prosecution evidence against their two former PAs . Claims: TV cook Nigella Lawson is expected to give evidence to the court next Wednesday against her former employees . Miss . Carpenter claimed the women would say their ‘exorbitant’ spending was . in exchange for keeping silent about Miss Lawson’s alleged heavy cocaine . use. The prosecutor added: . ‘It is anticipated they will claim Mr Saatchi and Miss Lawson permitted . them to use the credit cards to buy themselves presents and withdraw . cash because of the long hours they worked. ‘The . defendants’ case is that Miss Lawson’s alleged drug use and the . defendants’ knowledge of it materially affected Miss Lawson’s attitude . to the defendants’ spending.’ The case continues.

"It has long been known as the Holy Grail of comedy… and the Monty Python stars could barely contain their excitement yesterday as they announced their comeback. Despite all being in their seventies with a combined age of 357 years, the legendary troupe are getting back on stage together for the first time in 30 years. John Cleese, Terry Gilliam, Terry Jones, Eric Idle and Michael Palin have all agreed to reunite. Scroll down for video . Getting back together: The five remaining stars of Monty Python (from left: Eric Idle, Terry Jones, John Cleese, Michael Palin, Terry Gilliam, and Graham Chapman who died in 1989) are to reunite for a show . Cult comedy: The group's surreal TV series Monty Python's Flying Circus was first broadcast in 1969 . Once the secret was out there yesterday, Idle, 70, posted a giddy Twitter message: 'Python meeting this morning. 'Can't wait. Press conference Thursday will be live.' Jones, . 71, revealed that the ageing comedians hope to boost their bank . balances: 'We're getting together and putting on a show – it's real. 'I'm quite excited about it. I hope it makes us a lot of money. I hope to be able to pay off my mortgage!' And . he's not the only one hoping the cash will help. Cleese, 74, has made . no secret that despite the phenomenal success his comedic talent has . brought him, he has been left crippled financially by a £12.5million . divorce. Earlier this year . the stars were also all ordered to pay extra royalties to a former . producer after losing a High Court battle over their hit stage show . Spamalot. Comedy veterans: Michael Palin, Terry Gilliam, and Terry Jones (left to right) will get back together with John Clees and Eric Idle for the show . A judge ruled . that Mark Forstater, a producer of the 1975 film Monty Python And The . Holy Grail, was entitled to a seventh of the profits from the spin-off . musical, which has grossed well over £100million. The . reunion comes after several failed attempts to reform by the group, . which was last seen together in 1983's The Meaning Of Life. However, . according to sources, the surviving members realised 'it was now or . never'. It is understood . the Pythons will perform live again, with the potential for a film or TV . show to follow. But it is unknown if it will be new or old material or . both. More details are due . to emerge at a press conference tomorrow, which will take place at The . Playhouse Theatre in London's West End where Spamalot is running. Idle . is believed to have had higher earning power in recent years and is now . worth an estimated £10million after he co-wrote Spamalot with John Du . Prez and paid the other Pythons a fee, estimated to be £1million. Cleese, . who married his fourth wife Jennifer Wade last year, divorced his . third, Alyce Faye Eichelberger, in 2008. He launched a stand-up tour . called Alimony Tour to help fund the payments. JOHN CLEESE: Now 74, Cleese has had a long career of acting success since his days with Monty Python.  His work writing and starring in BBC hotel comedy series Fawlty Towers won him the greatest acclaim, and he also appeared in films including A Fish Called Wanda, Clockwise, and Bond films The World Is Not Enough and Die Another Day. Four-times married Cleese has also found success with a string of one-man shows.

John Cleese, left, is a successful actor and stand-up, while Terry Gilliam is a well-known director and writer . The American-born Python has been married to British wife Maggie for 40 years, and they have three grown-up children. In 2006 he renounced his U.S. citizenship in protest at President George W Bush, and spends a lot of his time in Umbria, Italy, because he can now only spend 29 days a year in America. TERRY JONES: The Welsh-born comedian went on to work as a director, author and musician.  Now 71, he went on to co-write the screenplay for Labyrinth, and directed Erik The Viking and The Wind In The Willows. Last year Jones, who is married to wife of 42 years Alison Telfer, announced that he had proposed to lover Anna Soderstrom, 30, with whom he has a three-year-old daughter, Siri.

MICHAEL PALIN: Sheffield-born Palin, 70, has gone on to find further fame as a maker of travel documentaries, a career he stumbled upon after making a show about his childhood love of train journeys for the BBC in 1980. Since then he has made programmes including Michael Palin: Around The World In 80 Days, Michael Palin's Hemingway Adventure, and Himalaya With Michael Palin.

The event has crept across the Atlantic over the past few years as U.S. giants such as Amazon and Apple have sought to include the UK in the shopping frenzy. This year British stores such as John Lewis and Debenhams have joined in - slashing their prices for one day only. Sofa Sunday has taken over from Cyber . Monday as the most popular day for online Christmas shopping in . Britain, according to a new report. Leading retailers say this year Sunday will be the busiest day for online orders. The first Monday of December was previously the most hectic day on the Internet. It is predicted that £4.4billion will be spent by an estimated 30 million shoppers this weekend alone. This weekend, workers will also have received their last monthly salary before Christmas. Almost . 50per cent of browsing will be between 7pm - 11pm, while we watch . peak-time TV in a new trend known as 'second screening', according to . online lifestyle site Notonthehighstreet. Previously . Internet shoppers would compile their chosen list of gifts over the . weekend and place orders on their desk computers when they got to work . on Monday, their report suggests. Holly . Tucker, chief executive of Notonthestreet.com said yesterday: 'Monday . has always been our busiest day, with typically 30% more browsers than . on a Sunday, but, in the pre-Christmas build up we've seen 25% more . Sunday shoppers than on a Monday - for the first time ever. 'Our . analysts are predicting that this Sunday will again top Monday in the . rush to buy gifts following the last pay day before Christmas.It appears . this year's Christmas shopping is being done from the sofa in front of . the telly.' High Street chain Debenhams backed the findings. Spokesperson Elena Antoniou said: 'Sundays are now our busiest day online. 'With . many people receiving their last pay packet before Christmas this . weekend we are expecting to see them to start their festive shopping in . earnest. Online shoppers were once stuck in the spare room on a desk . top, now they shop online from the sofa with tablets, smartphones and . laptops, while still keeping an eye on the TV.' Preparations: Employees select and dispatch items in the huge Amazon 'fulfilment centre' warehouse in Peterborough . Industry . observers say that habits have changed because of the phenomenal growth . in the use of handheld tablets and smart phone to order goods from . Internet sites. Last Cyber Monday  - December 3 2012 - . Amazon said they saw more than 3.5 million items ordered on their website, at a . rate of around 41 items per second. That meant that a delivery lorry packed . with Cyber Monday orders left one of Amazon's eight UK fulfilment . centres every two minutes and 10 seconds. In preparation, Amazon.co.uk is hiring more than 15,000 . people across the UK for seasonal positions in its fulfilment and . customer service centres this Christmas period.

"Heartless bureaucrats in Germany are threatening to destroy a comatose boy's pet dog who has become his chief 'carer' for the past six years. Every morning, Tascha the Staffordshire Bull Terrier comes into ten-year-old Dylan Gerzmehle's room and pulls back his blanket with her teeth. She then licks his feet and snuggles up to his face and remains by his side all day. 'A bond that should never be broken': German authorities are threatening to destroy a Staffordshire Bull Terrier who has been 'caring' for comatose boy Dylan Gerzmehle for the last six years after it bit a neighbour's dog . Devoted: Every morning, Tascha comes into Dylan's room, snuggles up to him and remains by his side all day . Complex machines monitoring his breathing and his heart record how both improve when she is present. Dylan’s parents Eckhard and Barbara say they have a bond that should never be broken - and Dylan’s doctors agree. But Tascha is a breed classified as a fighting dog in the state of Brandenburg near Berlin where Dylan lives. And she bit a neighbour’s dog last month in a kerbside scrap. This, say authorities, means she must move out - or be destroyed. Germans, usually passive in the face of an overarching state bureaucracy, have mobilised in their thousands to keep Dylan and Tascha together. Lobbying the mayor: Dylan's father Eckhard (pictured) says Tascha brings his son 'little sparks of happiness' Dangerous breed: Brandenburg state had turned a blind eye to a law banning Staffordshire Bull Terriers, but it is now ordering Tascha to be relocated or be destroyed . Already over 94,000 people have signed a petition on the social networking site Facebook and protestors are vowing to protest to Chancellor Angela Merkel if boy and dog are parted. 'Whenever the dog is with him, our son responds. He is happy,' says Eckhard, 59. 'His breathing becomes quieter, his heart rate falls. That could only be because of this dog.' Dylan was born into a vegetative state but his condition improved since Tascha arrived as a puppy six years ago. Dylan's father Eckhard . The family moved to the small town of Schonwalde in Brandenburg from Berlin to give Dylan more peaceful surroundings. But unlike Berlin, Brandenburg has a dangerous dog breed law that does not permit Staffordshire Terriers. Until recently, the district had not objected to Tascha as she has been neutered, properly reported and has received training from certified dog trainers. She also has passed temperament tests. But due to her dogfight with involving the neighbour’s pet the authorities are now enforcing the law. The Erna Graff Animal Welfare Foundation said the fight wasn’t even started by Tascha. Nonetheless, . the Gerzmehles paid for the veterinary treatment for the injured dog . and apologised for what happened. The dog is expected to fully recover . from his injuries. Outrage: More than 94,000 people have signed a petition on Facebook demanding the decision be reversed . But the family have been told that Tascha must move on or die. The Erna-Graff-Foundation is supporting the family legally, stating: 'If necessary, we will bring this matter before the Federal Constitutional Court' - the highest in Germany. Dylan's doctor also has spoken out for Dylan, saying the dog acts as a therapy dog for the critically ill boy and 'strongly advises' against taking Tascha away from him. 'We could really use the support of the authorities,' said Eckhard. 'We must keep Tascha for Dylan’s sake, for every little spark of happiness that she brings to him.' Town mayor Bodo Oehme said: 'My hands are tied. The case is clear: the dog bit another. 'What happens if he was to bite a person, or the child himself?' But a glimmer of hope is on the horizon: the parents are scheduled for a meeting with the mayor and other officials next week in the wake of the firestorm of protest. The mayor’s office said that if the parents can prove Tascha is a 'therapy dog', they will 'try to find a solution to this problem.' Eckhard, 49, said: 'They have already been around several times trying to take her away to kill her. I will believe it when I see it. But it is a hopeful sign.'","Staffordshire Bull Terrier stays by Dylan Gerzmehle's side every day .

"They are the urban vehicle of choice for the well-heeled across the UK – but the spiritual home of the Chelsea tractor is... erm, Chelsea. The gas-guzzlers are most likely to be sought after by the wealthy residents of the area of South West London that gave the off-road vehicle its nickname, a report out yesterday reveals. The home of the Sloane beats ‘Archers’ country’ in England, Shakespeare country in leafy Warwickshire, and even . Aberdeenshire in Scotland, and parts of rural Wales when it comes to . the popularity of 4X4s. A recent AA survey found drivers in south west London search online for 4x4 cars more than other motorists throughout the UK . In September, 1,955 people searched online for an off-roader in the home of the ‘Sloane Ranger’, according to research by AA Cars. It was comfortably ahead of rural . Worcestershire - the real life inspiration for BBC Radio Four’s . long-running rural soap-opera ‘The Archers’ - from which there were . 1,763 searches. It also beat Worcestershire (1,763 searches), Derbyshire (1,749), Warwickshire (1,701) and Cumbria (867) – rural areas for which the vehicles were designed. There are more than twice as many searches in the up-market London area . than in Aberdeenshire  (953), Monmouthshire in Wales (918), Aberdeen . (909), and Cumbria (867), which takes in the Lake District. The website www.theAACars.com currently offers more than 133,000 used cars, of which, more than 5,000 are 4x4s. The report said: ‘Whilst most 4x4s never go off road, . they can be very useful vehicles to negotiate potholes, tow boats or . caravans or accommodate numerous passengers who like a better view. Though designed for tough, rural terrain, 4x4s such as Range Rovers were most sought after by city dwellers according to the report . 'However with restricted parking, narrow streets and no congestion charge . exemptions for 4x4s in South West London, it is perhaps . surprising that their popularity is still so strong.’ Experts . say one possible reason is that 4X4s have a similarly large ‘footprint’ to a London black cab so are less likely to be intimidated, bullied or . cut up by other cars or big buses, and can better stand their ground in . the cut and thrust of the capital’s traffic. David . Bruce, director of AA Cars said: ‘It is surprising that there are more . searches for 4x4s in South West London than in most rural counties, from . Cumbria to Cornwall. 'Some of this may be linked to the status of the 4x4, the state of the roads or the fact that a proportion of Londoners like to retreat to the countryside in their ‘Chelsea tractors’ at weekends.’ He added: ‘It’s even been claimed that certain Sloane Rangers used spray-on mud on their vehicles to pretend that they had been off-road.’ He said: ‘As colder weather arrives we find that searches for 4x4s on AA Cars increase.'

"A menacing photograph of a zip tie found inside the jeep into which teenage killer Austin Sigg bundled 10-year-old Jessica Ridgeway before murdering, raping and dismembering her has been released. The stark image was part of a set of photographs of Sigg's Westminster, Colorado home used as evidence in his trial - including one which shows the wooden crawl space where the twisted teen hoarded some of the little girl's remains. Other pictures released reveal Sigg's typical teenage bedroom, with a poster of The Beatles slapped against the wall - but this is the room where he concocted his plan to kill Jessica - a crime for which he will now spend the rest of his life behind bars. Scroll Down for Video . Shocking: Zip ties found inside Austin Sigg's Jeep. Sigg used zip ties on Jessica Ridgeway when he kidnapped her on Oct. 5, 2012. He plead guilty to her kidnapping and death almost a year later . During the trial, Chief Deputy District Attorney Hal Sargent described Sigg's October 5, 2012 atrocities, including how he snatched Jessica off the street, lied to her as she begged to know whether she'd ever see her mother again, raped her and then strangled her before cutting up her body for his own sexual gratification. 'We have never seen a crime as heinous, depraved, whatever adjective we use to describe it....'  Sargent said. 'It's painful to imagine what he did . to her in that time,' Sargent said before explaining how Sigg sexually . assaulted the child, leaving her with horrific bruises then strangled . her to death. Sigg . first tried to strangle Jessica with zip ties but he told police later . that he didn't have 'enough leverage' so instead used his hands to . strangle her for up to three minutes. When he noticed she was still twitching, Sargent said Sigg filled a bathtub and forced her face into the scalding hot water. Sickening: View into the crawl space at Austin Sigg's home. After admitting he killed Jessica, Sigg led investigators to the crawl space where he had stored some of her remains . 'I don't want to go into all of the details of how he carefully, methodically dismembered her,' Sargent said during his November trial, but he did explain how he disposed of some of her organs but left her vagina, placing a cross in it. Sigg, 18, who was sentenced last week to spend the rest of his life in prison, was obsessed with mortuary and forensic science and was convinced he could outsmart detectives who were searching for Jessica's killer. Typical: Austin Sigg's bedroom in the Westminster home he shared with his mother and younger brother. Sigg pleaded guilty to kidnapping and killing 10-year-old Jessica Ridgeway . The Jefferson County District Court heard how he wiped the child's torso clean of DNA . evidence after he strangled and dismembered her - then brazenly offered a . sample of his own DNA to police when they took swabs from all of the . men in Jessica's neighborhood in Westminster, Colorado. Indeed, the court heard how the teen, . who was 17 at the time of the murder, practiced zip-tying and . restraining people on his own mother and slept in her bed night before . was arrested for the child's killing. Mindy . Sigg seemed to laugh off her son's increasingly-troubling behavior, . according to authorities. She joked to a friend about her his fixation . on body decomposition and revealed that she helped the 17-year-old . practice restraining people by letting him zip-tie her, police say. Frightening: The backseat of Austin Sigg's Jeep. Sigg waited in the back seat of the Jeep before he kidnapped Jessica Ridgeway on Oct. 5, 2012 . Police initially bungled the DNA test - . losing the sample he handed over that matched him to both Jessica's . murder and the attempted abduction of a jogger months earlier. Despite . Sigg's bizarre behavior and morbid fascination - his parents sent him . to a Christian counselor in an attempt to set him right - Sigg had a . girlfriend, at whose house at spent at least one night a week, it was revealed. The Denver Post reveals a host of chilling new details about the crime that shocked the Denver suburb and horrified the nation last October. Sigg . snatched Jessica off the street as she walked home from school after he . happened to spot her while he was out 'hunting' for a victim to kidnap . and kill, he admitted to detectives. Sentencing: Austin Sigg was been sentenced to life in prison in district court in Golden, Colorado, on Tuesday, November 19, 2013 . Confession: Sigg speaks softly, slowly and calmly as he talks them through the abduction and murder of the ten-year-old . Jessica had been told about the threat that ultimately cost her her life - she wrote two reminders in a journal found in her desk at school: 'Do not play at the park alone' and 'Watch out for strangers!' Despite Sigg's parents' initial concern about his fascination with decomposing bodies and violence, it soon became a laughing matter for his mother Mindy Sigg. A friend told police that Mindy joked about his strange habits. Ms Sigg even said that she had practiced zip-tying and restraining someone with her son, according to authorities. When Sigg snatched Jessica off the street, he immediately bound her hands and feet after throwing her into his SUV. Jessica was confused and scared and wet herself. She kept asking if Sigg knew her mother, Sigg later told police. 'I would tell her that everything was going to be OK. I would just lie to her,' he told detectives. Jessica's disappearance on her way home from school caused panic among . parents across Denver, who feared their children were not safe . He . told police he took Jessica back to his house and cut the ties that . bound her. He sat her in front of a TV and let her watch cartoons. He stripped her out of her wet clothes and made her change into a white t-shirt and black shorts from her closet. He then told her to turn away and he strangled her to death with plastic zip ties. He cut his hand in the process, as police photos show. He . dismembered her body and initially hid her remains in a pool house . behind his mother's home. He stashed some of Jessica's belongings in a . crawl space under the house. He . then dumped her remains in a garbage bag off a highway - but not before . he wiped down Jessica's torso. Investigators had to swab the remains . twice before they could even get a partial DNA sample. When . police came around to his house as part of a neighborhood-wide sweep to . collect DNA samples, Sigg brazenly offered his up - thinking that there . was nothing that could trace him back to the crime. Sadness: Jessica Ridgeway's aunt Becca Ridgeway, left, mother Sarah Ridgeway and grandmother Christine Ridgeway, right, testify in district court in Golden, Colorano, last week . Horror: Police discovered Jessica's body in a field off of a highway on October 19, 2012. It had been severely dismembered by Sigg, who admitted he killed her . What . he didn't know is that police had collected DNA from the attempted . abduction of a jogger four months earlier - and that they also had DNA . from the urine-soaked clothes that Sigg had stuffed in Jessica's . backpack and dumped in town. When . local media reported that police had linked the two cases, Sigg told . classmates at school that he felt 'tremendously' ill and 'wobbly,' the . Post reports. That night, he slept in his mother's bed. The next morning, he confessed his crime to Mindy Sigg - who called police. After his arrest, he led police to the crawl space, where he had kept some of Jessica's remains. A crime scene photo shows a black plastic garbage bag. Police found a broken black zip-tie in Sigg's Jeep SUV. They found bleach and black plastic trash bags on his porch - the same as Jessica's remains had been found in. A photo of the basement where Sigg spent much of his time and his bedroom show a profound mess. Dirty clothes and dirty dishes are piled high. A pair of samurai swords sit above his bed. In his dirty laundry, police found a cross necklace - similar to one that they had found in Rideway's backpack.","Images released today reveal the home where Austin Sigg raped and murdered 10-year-old Jessica Ridgeway .

"They say it pays to complain, but it seems there is a limit to what even the most generous of companies will tolerate. The Supreme Court indicated Tuesday it won't offer much help to frequent fliers who want to sue when airlines revoke their miles or their memberships. The justices heard the case of a Minnesota rabbi who was stripped of his top-level 'platinum elite' status in Northwest's WorldPerks program because the airline said he complained too much. Complainer: Rabbi Binyomin Ginsberg sued Northwest Airlines for breach of contract after the airline said he had abused their frequent flyer program by complaining 24 times in seven months . Rabbi S. Binyomin Ginsberg said Northwest, since absorbed by Delta Air Lines Inc., did not act in good faith when it cut him off. The airline says the federal deregulation of the airline industry in 1978 rules out most lawsuits like the one filed by Ginsberg. Most justices signaled they think that ruling for Ginsberg could give rise to state-by-state rules that the deregulation law was intended to prevent. Justice Stephen Breyer said Ginsberg's complaint also could apply to airline ticket prices, which are supposed to be set through competition among airlines. 'It sounds to me like I go in to, you know, get a ticket, my reasonable expectation is they're not going to charge me what they're going to charge, you know. I mean, it's unbelievable,' Breyer said. Under Ginsberg's view of the case, Breyer said he could sue over the prices. Wing clipped: The court will have to weigh whether federal law prevented Ginsberg from suing the airline for kicking him out of its frequent flyer program for allegedly complaining too frequently about the service . 'That might be a great idea, but I don't think that's the idea behind this act,' he said. Ginsberg said in court papers that he and his wife flew almost exclusively on Northwest, logging roughly 75 flights a year to travel across the U.S. and abroad to give lectures and take part in conferences on education and administration. He said he flew on Northwest even when other airlines offered comparable or better flights and in 2005, reached the highest level of the WorldPerks program. Northwest cut him off in 2008, shortly after Northwest and Delta agreed to merge. Ginsberg said the move was a cost-cutting measure designed to get rid of the high-mileage customers. Northwest says Ginsberg complained 24 times in a 7-month period, including nine instances of luggage that turned up late on airport baggage carousels. Northwest said that before it took action, it awarded Ginsberg $1,925 in travel credit vouchers, 78,500 bonus miles, a voucher for his son and $491 in cash reimbursements. Defense: Ginsberg's lawyers said he and his wife had been averaging about 75 flights on Northwest each year, and that Ginsberg estimated that only about 10 percent had resulted in a call to Northwest's customer care . World Perks: In one seven-month period, for example, the airline said that he filed 24 complaints and 'continually asked for compensation over and above' Northwest's guidelines . The airline pointed to a provision of the mileage program's terms that gives Northwest the right to cancel members' accounts for abuse. A federal trial judge cited earlier Supreme Court cases involving claims against frequent flier programs in dismissing Ginsberg's lawsuit, including his claim that Northwest did not live up to the terms of the contract. The judge said the contract gives the airlines the right to kick someone out of the mileage program at its 'sole judgment.' But the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco said part of the suit could go forward involving whether Ginsberg and others can sue under state laws that require parties to a contract to act in good faith. Justice Elena Kagan showed some sympathy for Ginsberg's claim when she questioned Paul Clement, the Washington lawyer representing Northwest at the Supreme Court. If the airline could easily avoid living up to its end of the bargain in the mileage program, Kagan said, 'I don't think that I'd be spending all this time in the air on your planes. You know, I'd find another company that actually gave me the free ticket.' Warnings: A customer representative emailed the rabbi quoting from the WorldPerks terms and conditions that said membership could be terminated for 'improper conduct as determined by Northwest in its sole judgment' Clement replied that Kagan's example shows that the free market, not a court, is the right place to address her problem. 'So if some airline really were crazy enough to systematically turn on its most lucrative and loyal customers, surely, the market would solve that. And, of course, if a bunch of airlines did it, the Department of Transportation stands ready to police that,' he said. Several justices questioned whether it is important to the case that many people earn and spend miles on items other than airline tickets. 'Do we have to worry about that in this case?' Justice Samuel Alito asked. Adina Rosenbaum, Ginsberg's lawyer, told the court that the growth of mileage programs to encompass more than airline tickets is another reason to rule that Ginsberg's lawsuit is not blocked by the deregulation law. Breyer said the court perhaps could leave questions involving miles earned elsewhere 'for another day.' A decision is expected by late June. The case is Northwest vs. Ginsberg, 12-462.","Traveler was dropped by Northwest frequent flier program after he complained 24 times in eight months .

"The boss of Domino’s Pizza said yesterday he could create 1,000 jobs tomorrow – but too many British people do not want the work. Lance Batchelor, the takeaway chain’s chief executive, said it was becoming ‘harder and harder to hire staff, especially in London and the South East’. ‘We could fill 1,000 jobs across the UK tomorrow if we could get candidates to apply for them,’ he said. Staff: Domino's boss Lance Batchelor said his firm struggled to find people to work in the pizza delivery business (file picture) Around 22,500 people work for Domino’s . in the UK but Mr Batchelor told the Evening Standard: ‘Every branch in . London is operating at less than full capacity because of the problem . securing labour.’’ He added: ‘It is particularly difficult to get drivers and people to work in production.’ His . comments came after the former boss of Marks & Spencer, Sir Stuart . Rose, also attacked the work ethic of many Britons and said it was wrong . to criticise  immigrants prepared to work for lower salaries. Sir . Stuart added: ‘It is up to people to decide whether they want to do the . work for the pay that is being offered. If they don’t, somebody else is . there to do it. What’s wrong with that?’ The comments come amid fears . that the UK will see an influx of immigrants from Bulgaria and Romania . when working restrictions are lifted next month. Last week Romania’s Labour minister said Britain should be grateful so . many Romanians filled jobs Britons were unwilling to do. Mariana . Campeanu said Romanian migrants contributed ‘greatly’ to Britain’s gross . domestic product and criticised feelings of ‘racism and xenophobia’ towards her countrymen. Sir Stuart Rose: 'There are a lot of people who complain about their lot' His remarks came after Sir Stuart Rose said Romanians and Bulgarians and other immigrants should not be blamed for coming to the UK if Britons were not prepared to do menial jobs. He said: ‘I’m a free market economist – we operate in a free market. If these people want to come here, and work the hours they are prepared to work for the wages they are prepared to work for, then so be it.’ He added: ‘I know people will look at me and say “It’s all right for you”, but I started off with pretty well nothing, I did a lot of menial jobs when I was young. I didn’t worry about the status of the job – I was more worried about my self-esteem and the fact I had a job. In fact I would look myself in the mirror and say, “I’ve earned a few bob”. Sir Stuart told Sky News there were increasing signs the economy had turned the corner. He said: ‘If you go outside of London, companies are recruiting again. There are real signs things are beginning to move. 'We can argue about the quality of the recovery, but I think of it like a football match. A win is a win. ‘We can argue afterwards the quality of . the win, the quality of the play, but we can argue about that later – a . win is a win and we are winning. Anger: Sir Stuart's comments came after the Romanian Minister for Labour Mariana Campeanu (left) said Britons should be grateful for migrant workers and attacked what she called 'racism and xenophobia' ‘Many companies are preparing to re-invest. And it’s wrong to say it’s London-centric, it’s a UK-centric thing. There are some good things happening.’ Sir Stuart, who is now the chairman of online grocer Ocado, said Marks & Spencer would have a good Christmas. Asked about rival Tesco’s sales plunge, he said the supermarket giant was simply playing catch-up after being ‘wrong-footed’. Sir Stuart added: ‘It’s what happens to countries, to big business and it’s a phrase that was said to me once. ‘If you don’t look out of the window every day you will look out one day and see the world has passed you by. And I think that’s what happened to Tesco. ‘They worked hard expanding their business into a global presence and they milked the UK too hard, using the cash from the UK cow. ‘When they looked out of the window they realised the UK was not as structurally sound as it could have been and they hadn’t kept abreast of some of the trends. They found themselves wrong-footed. ‘Catching up when you’re wrong-footed is a massive task, but they have to keep going. It is still a fine business.’","Domino's boss Lance Batchelor says firm struggles to recruit staff .

"Decorating a Christmas tree is a tradition most of us associate with glitter, jolly Santa figures and shining baubles – unless, of course, you happen to be Norwegian.

"Thousands of airline passengers could face further delays today after a major air traffic control glitch caused disruption at airports across the UK and Ireland. Hundreds of flights were cancelled or delayed yesterday after problems with a telephone system at the National Air Traffic Service (Nats) centre in Swanwick, Hampshire. Up to 100,000 passengers faced delays and cancellation at the major airports of Heathrow, Stansted and . Gatwick, after an air traffic control glitch led to the worst airport chaos since the 2010 ash cloud crisis. Travel hell: Passengers queue at the flight check-in desk to re-book tickets at London Heathrow Airport Terminal Five after a 'technical problem' at the National Air Traffic Services control centre caused long delays . Distressed: One man looked glum and another was holding his head in his hands at Stansted Airport in Essex . Taking a nap: A woman sleeps at London Gatwick as Britain's airports experienced delays and cancellations . Not moving: Fed-up passengers are seen waiting and queuing at London Heathrow Airport on Saturday . Ginger beards: Lizzy Roberts posted this photograph on Twitter, saying she and her friends were stranded at Stansted Airport with a three-hour delay, hoping to make it to Dublin to celebrate a 30th birthday . Passengers queuing for the Ryanair ticket desk at Stansted airport in Essex . Officials said there were more than 250 . flight cancellations, with a further 1,000 flights delayed by a broken . internal telephone system in a single air traffic control base. Air traffic control chiefs announced at 7.30pm on Saturday that they had finally solved the glitch, 14 hours after the problems began. Earlier they had missed a self-imposed 6.30pm target for fixing the issue. European air traffic controllers at Eurocontrol said that in all 1,300 flights across Britain and Ireland were delayed by the chaos. While the disruption is likely to have a knock-on effect today, the three main London airports predicted a largely trouble-free day. A spokesman for London Heathrow said last night: 'There are no planned flight schedule changes for Sunday. We still advise passengers to check with airlines prior to travelling though.' Gatwick said that operations had returned to normal and it was 'not anticipating significant disruptions' today, while Stansted forecast a normal flight schedule but advised passengers to check the status of flights with airlines.

Aircraft can be seen grouped over Stansted (top centre) and Gatwick (bottom centre) Unhappy: Plane passengers took to Twitter to express their dismay at the delays across Britain this morning . The problem occurred when the 23 . controllers on a night shift at Swanwick handed over to the 125 . controllers on the day shift at about 6am. Nats' night-time operating system, which combines sectors of airspace for . when it is less busy, did not properly switch over to the daytime . system, causing a communication problem with the centre's internal . telephones. They stressed that safety was not at risk at any time. Waiting game: Passengers queue at the flight check-in desk at London Heathrow Airport Terminal Five . Standing in line: A spokesman for British Airways said the airline is trying to 'minimise disruption to our flights' Problems: Heathrow had cancelled 60 flights by 9.45am, with that figure split roughly equally between departures and arrivals . Waiting around: Passengers queue outside Terminal Three at Heathrow Airport as thousands were delayed . Delays galore: A flight information board at Birmingham Airport, as a 'technical problem' at the National Air Traffic Services control centre in Swanwick, Hampshire, caused delays at airports across Britain . Delays: Passengers at Gatwick Airport (file picture) were warned they could be waiting for 'a couple of hours' Grounded: London Stansted Airport (file picture) said all of its departing flights were subject to delays of between 30 minutes and two hours . Heathrow . was the worst affected, with 228 cancellations - 112 in arrivals, and . 116 departures, with most being short-haul flights. A spokesman for the . airport said the cancellations represented 15% of their usual daily . total of 1,300 flights going in and out of the airport. She added: 'Today we have 18 cancellations - 11 arrivals and seven departures - and that's mostly due to crew displacement. 'Apart from that we are pretty much running as normal.' Frustrated . passengers were left in long queues to rebook flights, while others . reported having to wait for hours to speak to airline representatives. Manchester . Airport, Leeds Bradford, Doncaster Robin Hood, Newcastle, Birmingham, . Belfast International Airport and Dublin Airport were also all affected. The . glitch affected flights across Europe, with 1,300 flights, nearly 8 per . cent of all traffic in Europe, 'severely delayed', according to . Eurocontrol, the European organisation for air navigation safety. A . spokesman for Nats said last night: 'As of 7.30pm we had handled 3,250 . flights today - around 90 per cent of the traffic handled last Saturday . (3,613 flights).' In a . statement yesterday, Nats apologised for the disruption, saying: 'The . reduction in capacity has had a disproportionate effect on southern . England because it is extremely complex and busy airspace and we . sincerely regret inconvenience to our airline customers and their . passengers. 'To be clear, . this is a very complex and sophisticated system with more than a million . lines of software. This is not simply internal telephones, it is the . system that controllers use to speak to other ATC agencies both in the . UK and Europe and is the biggest system of its kind in Europe. 'This . has been a major challenge for our engineering team and for the . manufacturer, who has worked closely with us to ensure this complex . problem was resolved as quickly as possible while maintaining a safe . service.' Looking down: There have been cancellations at London Heathrow Airport for flights scheduled to leave. A file pictured of the view for two air traffic controllers from the control tower at Heathrow is seen . Problems: A spokesman for Heathrow Airport (file picture) said it was 'currently experiencing some delays' The £623 million National Air Traffic Services (NATS) centre yesterday experienced a failure of ‘a very complex and sophisticated system’. During the night, when there are fewer flights, a single air traffic controller can handle more than one sector of airspace, but as the day begins, with a corresponding upsurge in the number of planes in the air, the system is designed to split air space into several smaller sectors, each handled by a separate controller. Issue: A computing glitch in the early hours of the morning at the Nats control centre (pictured) in Swanwick, Hampshire, meant the night-time operation failed to properly switch over to the daytime system . Yesterday that split did not happen and the system remained in ‘sleep’ mode. That left air traffic controllers unable to open up the skies to the usual daytime volume of flights, so initially, departing flights were grounded to allow incoming airliners on long-haul journeys to land. Operations at NATS at Swanwick, in Hampshire, have been affected by computer glitches before, but yesterday’s problem was unconnected to any previous malfunctions. As NATS staff worked to overcome the difficulty, bosses were looking to see  if recent changes or routine maintenance could have been  to blame. Part-privatised in 2001, NATS had a series of software problems as it prepared to move operations to Hampshire from its old HQ at West Drayton in West London.","In total, 100,000 passengers are affected and 1,300 flights disrupted .

"Disgraced baseball player Ryan Braun has married his model girlfriend Larisa Fraser this weekend. The Milwaukee Brewers outfielder was suspended for several months during the Major League season this year, after admitting that an overturned positive performance-enhancement drug test in 2011 had been accurate. On Saturday, the 30-year-old married his 24-year-old partner in a family ceremony in Malibu, California. In sickness and in stealth: Milwaukee Brewers outfielder Ryan Braun marries Larisa Fraser in Malibu, California . Ms Fraser, the new Mrs Braun, is originally from Toronto Canada but now lives in Los Angeles where she works as a fashion model and food blogger, running the popular website Model Eats. She wrote on her blog: ‘Saturday I married the man of my dreams. 'It was perfect. Thanks to everyone for celebrating with us and for all of the well wishes!’ Braun won the National League MVP in 2011, but his image and reputation has been tarnished since his 2011 urine test which concluded a raised level of testosterone. The raised levels were ruled to have been caused by a performance-enhancing drug and Braun faced a 50-game suspension. Holy matrimony: The wedding finished off a tough year for Braun who was suspended in July after admitting taking performance-enhancing drugs in 2011 . Living clean: Braun's partner Larisa Fraser is a lingerie and fashion model and runs a popular health-food blog called Model Eats . Patience: Ryan Braun, who waited two years to confess that he had taken performance-enhancing drugs, awaits his bride . Colour of innocence: The 24-year-old lingerie-model bride wore white . However, Braun appealed the positive . test in January 2012 and it was overturned by an arbitration panel after . questions were raised regarding the way the urine sample had been . handled. In February 2013, . it was revealed that Braun's name appeared in the records of a Miami . clinic which allegedly distributed performance-enhancing drugs to . several baseball players, including Alex ‘A-Rod’ Rodriguez. As . a result, this season, Braun only managed 61 games before he was . suspended on July 22, for the remainder of the season for violations of . the Basic Agreement and its Joint Drug Prevention and Treatment Program. 'Valued': Ryan Braun was voted Most Valuable Player in 2011, the year he took performance-enhancing drugs . In August Ryan Braun admitted taking performance-enhancing drugs during his NL MVP season of 2011, saying he took a cream and a lozenge containing banned substances while rehabilitating an injury. 'It was a huge mistake for which I am deeply ashamed and I compounded the situation by not admitting my mistakes immediately,' Braun said in a statement released by the Brewers.

"A 14-year-old girl, named online as Sarah Clerkson, died in hospital after she was found hanging at a house party . A schoolgirl is believed to have hanged herself at a teenage house party after suffering weeks of abuse from jealous bullies. Sarah Clerkson, 14, was found unconscious in a bedroom early on Sunday and died shortly afterwards in hospital. Horrified teenagers at the party kicked the door down when they realised something was wrong and tried to revive her with CPR. Friends and family said Sarah had become ‘emotionally disturbed’ after being picked on by girls. They were said to be envious of her good looks. Sarah moved schools about six weeks ago after being bullied. She wrote on Facebook about how she was moving after being hit by another girl, but her family said she faced further bullying at her new school. Grandfather David Chapman, 64, said she appeared to be coping better in recent weeks. ‘We saw her a few weeks ago,’ he said. ‘We went to the Metrocentre [a shopping complex in Gateshead] and she was bubbling, or in her words “buzzing”. ‘She was emotionally disturbed but we thought things were starting to change for her. ‘There’d been a problem with her introduction into a new school. She was bullied for about a week. You know what they’re like when new kids come but it had all blown over.’ The night she died, Sarah and a friend had been invited to a house party held by a teenager in Spennymoor, County Durham. John Moore, 16, the party host, said yesterday that he invited a few people around to help celebrate one of his friends getting a job. ‘There was alcohol, but no drugs, and everyone was relaxed,’ said John, a student at New College Durham. Sarah was taken to the University Hospital of North Durham (pictured) where she later died . He said everyone seemed to be getting . on with Sarah but she confided that she had relationship problems and . was ‘upset about past experiences’. John . said Sarah was sick later in the evening and had to be put to bed in a . back bedroom. ‘Everyone was concerned about her,’ he added. ‘At about . 12.15am we went to see how she was. We got no reply and we had to kick . the door down. ‘I began to . give CPR under instruction over the phone from the ambulance service. Then a police officer arrived and he took over the CPR until the . paramedics got there. It was such a shock.’ Sarah . was taken to the University Hospital of North Durham but could not be . revived. Darlington Police said there were no suspicious circumstances . surrounding her death. Yesterday, her grandmother, Linda Chapman, 63, paid tribute to the . ‘beautiful’ and ‘bubbly’ schoolgirl. ‘She touched everybody’s heart,’ she said. ‘She was lovely, but she had a lot of emotional issues and . family problems with her parents.’ Thousands of people have since joined Facebook groups paying tribute to the teenager. Well-wishers . speculated that Sarah had been picked on by girls jealous of her good . looks, with many calling for the bullies to be dealt with. Denise . Burnikell wrote: ‘That is why she would get bullied, because she is . stunning. Jealousy is a terrible thing.’ Anth . Freeman posted: ‘I can’t understand in this day and age how bullies get . away with this. Surely in a court of law this should be manslaughter, . as this poor girl was driven to take her own life.’ For confidential support contact Samaritans on 08457 90 90 90 or click here.","Schoolgirl Sarah Clerkson found unconscious in a bedroom at house party .

"Paedophile rock star Ian Watkins begged a lover to let him abuse her 10-year-old daughter and even suggested they have a child together so he could rape it, it emerged today. A female fan has also revealed the Lostprophets singer even offered to DJ at her child's birthday party in return for sex with the little girl. For years the woman, in her twenties, had sex with Watkins as he flew her to gigs around the world, but she broke it off when she realised 'he is just insane'. But before then they exchanged lewd messages online where the singer showed himself performing a sex act and asked if the 10-year-old could watch. Shocking: Ian Watkins pictured himself performing a sex act in a Skype conversation, where he also begged to abuse the daughter of a fan he was having sex with . Exchange: This AOL conversation shows how Watkins apparently offered to DJ at the woman's daughter's party in return for sex with her child . 'He mentioned my daughter - she would have been 10 - . and that's when I was like 'Oh my God, you need help and we can't talk . ever again. You've really crossed the line now by talking about my . daughter,' she said. 'I was talking to him on Skype. He wanted me to go and get . her from the other room - he was masturbating - so she could see how . hot he was and so that she could tell me how much she wanted him.' In one chilling message, sent on March 4, 2011, the woman innocently asked him to DJ at her daughter's birthday party. Watkins replied: 'Only if I can f*** her.' Watkins even suggested to the woman . that the couple should have a baby together - so he could sexually abuse . the defenceless infant. 'In . 2010 he mentioned that he wanted to have a baby because he wanted to . raise it to be evil like me and him - apparently, I'm evil now too,' she . said. 'A year later he said he wanted us to have a baby so he could . have his way with the baby and my daughter could watch how it's done.' The woman broke off contact with Watkins following the graphic messages he sent about sleeping with her young daughter. 'He was obsessed with the 'dark side' and . wanted to go to hell. He used his power to push the limits. I guess it . was all the drugs - he just went way, way, way too far.' Another message sent by Watkins read: 'The more drugs I do the filthier I am and the younger I get - it's a curse.' Abuser: The singer would demand help to abuse 'young sluts' in a series of unpleasant exchanges online . The woman . contacted South Wales Police and passed records of her conversations . with the star to investigators following his arrest in December 2012. 'I was so relieved when he was arrested. I thought: 'Finally,'' she said. 'I thought he was going to get caught one day. Watkins' admission in court that he was a child abuser was 'not a surprise at . all,' the woman added. 'He is a very sick person, controlling and . manipulative. 'I still can't get over those women not protecting . their babies when they knew what he was capable of. That is the most . shocking.' Message: Watkins invited his lover to Los Angeles in this crude message published today . Manipulation: The woman was also seduced by Watkins' fame and wealth, being flown around the world to meet him . The woman told how the pair first met backstage at an overseas gig in 2004 and exchanged contact details. Two years later she messaged the rocker asking for tickets to a music festival. Watkins obliged and, after meeting in a hotel room the couple began a sexual relationship which included meetings over several years. The Lostprophets frontman, who has sold more than 3.5 million records, even met the woman's daughter when he invited her to a gig in 2007. The woman, in her late 30s, said: 'We went to the show and we were backstage. 'He came out and met her and took some photos and everything was normal and then he later signed a poster addressed to my daughter, describing her as 'beautiful'. She added: 'Later, he actually saw the photos of him and my daughter and her friend and a few years later said him and my daughter would make a really good-looking couple. She was aged seven in the photo.' The woman, who lives abroad, described how Watkins 'got weirder and weirder and more dark as the years went by'. Menace: Lostprophets singer Ian Watkins face jail for a string of child sex offences, and seduced fans to get to their children, it was claimed today . She said: 'By 2010 I felt like 'Oh my God, he is just insane'.' The pair would meet up regularly and chat online, while the internationally-renowned frontman would invite her to gigs around the world. 'He was always inviting me to his shows not to 'abuse' me - that's one of his favourite words - it was to help him,' she said. 'He wanted me to help him - I think it was because we were about the same age - find young girls at the show. 'He would say: 'You can find us some young sluts to abuse.'' The woman added: 'I told him: 'You are using your fame - those little girls love you and you are using your fame to live out your sexual fantasies.'' From early 2010, Watkins would talk almost obsessively about drugs and his child abuse fantasies to the women he was meeting for sex, the woman claimed. 'He would talk about what he wanted to do to babies but you never think there's a fan out there that would say: 'Here's my baby'. 'We knew what he wanted to do but it's an unthinkable act - you don't think he is going to attempt to rape a baby.' She added: 'He wanted to be evil. He would say he was evil and would say he wanted everyone to know.' Famous: Rock star Watkins approached fans via the Lostprophets website before meeting young girls for sex . The star's perverted fantasies were not limited to children, the woman claimed. 'In 2011 Lostprophets went to play a festival in the country where my mum lives and he offered to get me tickets. We were talking on Skype and he said: 'You can come and help me abuse young sluts after the show.'' When she declined, Watkins asked instead: 'What about if we hook up - me, you and your mum?' The woman added: 'He got obsessed about it for a few weeks - his little obsession while he was there was me, my mum and him. 'I wouldn't fly there so he just kept asking me for my mum's phone number and address - he said he would go there and surprise her. 'He said: 'She won't be able to say no to me, no-one says no to me.' 'I've always said to the police, there's hundreds of victims out there and you're never going to find them because the mothers are in on it,' Miss Majic said.","Woman, in her twenties, had relationship with him but admitted 'he's insane'

"A five-year-old girl who signed during her kindergarten Christmas concert in Florida so her deaf parents wouldn't miss out has melted hearts across the U.S. Claire Koch can be seen singing as she uses finger spelling and signing to match the lyrics of popular carols such as Rudolph the Rednose Reindeer and Jingle Bells. Proud mother Lori, who is hearing impaired, posted the cute video to YouTube after reading about claims that a sign language interpreter at the Nelson Mandela memorial was a fake. Scroll down for video . Christmas spirit: Claire Loch signs the words to Jingle Bells for her deaf parents .

The video quickly went viral and had more than 100,000 hits as viewers watched little Claire enthusiastically signing to a series of Christmas songs. Claire's parents, who are both deaf, decided to put the video on YouTube after watching the poor performance of the Mandela sign language interpreter. 'It became obvious he was making things up.

During the video of their daughter's school concert, the other children were doing hand actions for the songs, but Claire stood out from the crowd as she used American Sign Language. 'I, myself, haven’t been able to stop watching the video,' Mrs Koch told Buzzfeed.

"Iran is openly defying the United States, insisting that 'the structure of sanctions has cracked and its collapse has started.' The statement from Tehran came Thursday night via the state-run FARS news service, even as a top Treasury Department official sought to reassure the world that 'the sanctions pressure on Iran will continue to mount.' Iran walked out of talks in Geneva designed to implement a deal struck on Nov. 24, following the Obama administration's decision to take a hard line on enforcing sanctions against companies that assist Tehran with its nuclear program. Treasury undersecretary for terrorism and financial intelligence David Cohen claimed in Wednesday's Wall Street Journal that 'Iran will be even deeper in the hole six months from now when the deal expires than it is today.' But Iran maintained that its crude oil sales 'will be maintained at the current level and Iran’s oil revenues will also be released.' No guarantees: Secretary of State John Kerry has sidestepped questions about the nuclear deal with Iran, telling Congress that he can't promise what the outcome will be . Big problem: Iran's Arak nuclear facility is home to the nation's enrichment of plutonium, which is used for nuclear weapons but has no peaceful purpose . 'Sanctions on Iran’s petrochemical sector will be completely removed and the sanctions on the country’s auto industry will also be lifted,' the Islamic republic's regime claimed. The State Department cut a deal with Tehran in Geneva last month that dangled the carrot of sanctions relief on the condition that Iran keep its end of a bargain that would temporarily curtail its nuclear program and open its facilities to inspectors. A limited set of sanctions, however, have already been put on track for a rollback. Wendy Sherman, the top U.S. nuclear negotiator, said Thursday in a Senate Banking Committee hearing that 'between $6-7 billion' in relief was agreed to in the Geneva accord between Iran and the P5+1 nations, which include the U.S., the UK, Russia, China, France, and Germany. Through his government-controlled news agency, Iranian president Hassan Rouhani has insisted that his nation will escape from America's harsh sanctions regime and regain access to much of its international trade program . The sanctions relief represents a 'modest fraction of the approximately $100 billion in foreign exchange holdings that are inaccessible or restricted,' Sherman assured the senators. But the crack in the international community's previously rigid position has given Iran room to made sweeping claims. A group of U.S. senators led by South Dakota Democrat Tim Johnson is busily preparing legislation that would ramp up sanctions, not relax them, if Iran renegs on its nuclear agreement in the next six months. The White House has tried to wave lawmakers off, saying that its negotiations will maintain enough pressure on Iran to ensure its compliance with the nuclear restrictions it accepted. Over objections from Tehran, the Obama administration moved on Thursday to blacklist 19 companies and individuals linked to Iran's nuclear program. 'The Joint Plan of Action reached in Geneva does not, and will not, interfere with our continued efforts to expose and disrupt those supporting Iran’s nuclear program or seeking to evade our sanctions,' Cohen said in a statement. After the U.S. announced the move, Tehran abruptly broke off talks. One diplomat told Reuters that Iranians negotiators said 'they had received instructions from Tehran to stop the discussions and fly back to Tehran. It was quite unexpected.' The White House hopes aggressive enforcement of existing sanctions will help persuade Congress to take a wait-and-see attitude instead of embracing a new round of sanctions in the near future. Distraction #1: The U.S. has paid for billboards throughout the Arab world promising a reward for information leading to the return from Iran of Robert Levinson, who was outed this week as a CIA asset operating in Iran . Distraction #2: A Kuwaiti newspaper published a claim in November that President Obama was looking for a way to visit Tehran . Relaxing sanctions on businesses that sell cars, airplane parts, petrochemicals and precious metals, worried Capitol Hill sources told MailOnline, could allow Tehran to stockpile enough supplies and sell enough material to sustain it for more than a decade if sanctions should tighten in the future. 'We're worried that if Iran can suddenly buy aircraft parts, and then we shut off that spigot six months from now, they will already have had enough time to warehouse enough material to outlast whatever we might throw at them next,' a senior Republican Senate aide said. And critics worry that Iran could sell gold and oil in sufficient volume to fund whatever nuclear ambitions it secretary harbors. 'Think of it this way,' former Reagan administration Defense Department official KT MacFarland said in an email. 'Iran has a bowl of popcorn, a popcorn machine and kernels, but they're broke.' 'We've just given them some money in exchange for the bowl of popcorn. They've still got the machine and the kernels. They can always make more popcorn.'","Iran recalled its negotiators from Geneva after the U.S. moved to blacklist companies that help Tehran build its nuclear program .

"Drug mule Melissa Reid’s prison sentence for smuggling cocaine is too harsh, her parents claimed last night, as they revealed their fears that she will spend the best years of her life behind bars. Melissa and fellow mule Michaella McCollum Connolly were last week jailed for six years eight months – the minimum term – after being caught trying to smuggle £1.5 million of cocaine out of Peru in August. The Mail on Sunday understands the British women are not eligible for a sentence reduction, meaning they will serve the full term. Scroll down for video . Melissa Reid, 20, appears in a Peruvian court in September this year. She and friend Michaella McCollumn have been sentenced to six years and seven months in prison . Melissa’s father, Billy, 53, said:  ‘We think the sentence is too harsh and doesn’t sit with the crime. ‘They’re first-time offenders and they didn’t instigate it. 'The other people involved – the bigger players – must be watching all this. They must still not be able to sleep easy at night.’ The family are not appealing against the decision and are clinging to hopes that Melissa may one day be transferred back to the UK to serve part of her sentence. Debbie Reid, who is pictured after flying out to Peru to support her daughter claims that the sentence is too long . Mr Reid, from Lenzie, near Glasgow, added: ‘This stigmatises Melissa for the rest of her life.  She’s always going to be known as the drug mule. We’re the drug mule’s father and mother. That’s what it will be for ever more. ‘Melissa lost two grandparents this year before all this happened. She’s got two elderly grandparents now  – personally, I don’t think she’ll  ever see them again.’ Melissa, 20, revealed her torment in an emotional phone call to her mother, Debbie, the morning after she was sentenced. She told her: ‘I really don’t think it has sunk in yet. I wish you and Dad had been there.’ Sentence: Miss McCollum, right, and Miss Reid, left, were given sentences of six years and eight months for drug trafficking. They are shown attending a court hearing last month . Breaking down in tears, she added: ‘I’m just frightened about what’s going to happen next. It’s such a long time. At least I’ve got Michaella here with me.’ Melissa and Michaella, from Dungannon in Northern Ireland, were arrested trying to board a plane bound for Spain with 11kg of cocaine in their suitcases. They originally claimed to have been kidnapped  by a gang in Ibiza and forced to travel to Peru, but later accepted responsibility and pleaded guilty. Mr Reid said: ‘I thought it might bring some kind of closure but it’s just opened up more issues and brought uncertainty. How long do they actually have to serve in Peru?

"Melissa Reid (right) and Michaella McCollum Connolly (above, in Peru in September) agreed to plead guilty to smuggling £1.5m of cocaine in the hope their term would be reduced to six years and eight months . The two British drug mules held in Peru face being handed 15-year sentences this week as their hopes of a more lenient jail term crumble. Melissa Reid and Michaella McCollum Connolly, both 20, agreed to plead guilty to smuggling £1.5million’s worth of cocaine in the hope their term would be reduced to six years and eight months. But with sentencing due to take place in a closed court in Lima on Tuesday, the girls’ lawyers have so far been unable to agree a plea bargain with prosecutors. Melissa revealed her despair in a prison diary. She wrote: ‘I have prepared myself for the worst . . . I think of how I will be in 15 years . . . and yes it does still scare me. ‘I would really like to have this over with by Christmas because the fear of the unknown makes me more anxious. I’ve been waiting four months already and the delays and changes are annoying.’ The diary displays Melissa’s fears about being transferred after sentencing to the prison Ancon 2. It is miles from Lima, making it much harder for her family to see her. She is also terrified that she will be separated from Michaella, with whom she has shared a cell since their arrest. She . added: ‘I am consistently aware of my immediate transfer to Ancon after . my sentence and would much rather stay in [Virgen de] Fatima for the . Christmas period because of the fear of the unknown in Ancon. ‘[It is] really far from Lima making . visiting much more difficult for my family when they come and it’s over . populated so I could possibly be separated from Michaella. (That’s . something I have not prepared myself for).’ Melissa revealed her despair in a prison diary. She wrote: 'I have prepared myself for the worst... I think of how I will be in 15 years... and yes it does still scare me' Last night Melissa’s distraught family were praying for their daughter to receive the minimum sentence. Melissa’s father Billy said: ‘This is a really tense time for us – we’ve been told sentencing is going ahead on Tuesday. Melissa has done everything she can, we just have to hope and pray for the best now.’ Writing from her cell, Melissa, from Lenzie, near Glasgow, also described her devastation at being told that under current Peruvian law she does not qualify for the benefits that allow some prisoners to get out after serving only a third of their sentence. The girls had hoped that by working or studying they could use the privilege to cut a six-year jail term to just over two years. She wrote: ‘All this time the idea was I would be sentenced to six years eight months but then serve a third of that if I worked or studied [in prison] – so roughly two years three months – but now I will have to serve the full sentence. ‘I have never been someone to 100 per cent believe something someone tells me without evidence but of course being told I would be doing two years three months gave me somewhat of a rough guide when realistically it’s actually miles off what I will be doing.’ She added: ‘Apparently things regarding the law in Peru change so much that anything could happen. Who knows, the president might give a pardon and want all of the Europeans chucked out of Peru.’ The Reids on holiday several years ago. Melissa is second right beside her mother . The pair have served more than four months in the squalid Virgen de Fatima prison since being arrested in August trying to carry 24lb of cocaine on to a flight to Spain from Lima’s international airport. The girls initially claimed they were kidnapped on the party island of Ibiza during a summer of partying and forced at gunpoint to traffic the drugs. Although they subsequently declared their willingness to plead guilty, the Peruvian authorities have yet to officially accept the pleas, which means they could still be given the maximum of 15 years. Sentencing has already been delayed twice as Peruvian judges strike for higher pay. Although it has been set for Tuesday, a last-minute delay is still possible. If the girls are given seven years or less they are eligible to apply for transfer to the UK, though this must be agreed by both governments. The girls will also be required to pay a civil fine before release, likely to be several thousand pounds each. On Tuesday, a day Melissa described as ‘one of the worst yet’, the women were driven to a court for sentencing – even though their lawyers had already told them that it would be postponed. She wrote: ‘I was marched to court for nothing. I was transported all day from Fatima to Sarita Colonia [prison] then to other places. I kept wondering what was taking so long but I guess I will never know. Finally I was brought back to Fatima.’","Melissa Reid and Michaella McCollum .

"A brave passenger was applauded by fellow commuters after standing up to a preacher on the subway who was hurling a tirade of homophobic abuse. A video shows the preacher shouting: 'If I weren't a preacher and I saw you I would get my shotgun. Michael Jackson died because he was gay.' The man leaps from his seat and responds: 'I am a man. I am a good man and I'm a gay man. And Jesus loves me. Jesus loves me!' Scroll down for video . Left: The preacher (pictured far left in a brown leather jacket) was challenged by the gay man, (right, wearing  a hat).

Do not listen to this man he is full of hatred, he is scared, he is ignorant.' The gay man repeatedly shouts 'false prophet' over the preacher, and gains support from his fellow passengers, some of whom were filming the confrontation on their cell phones. The preacher makes reference to 'little boys' and says: 'What the Hell are you teaching our children?' to which the gay man responds: 'That's not gay, that's a pedophile.' The preacher added: 'You can't put two men together. Man not . got no breasts, man got penis. 'It's an abomination. I tell Obama that . gay is wrong, I tell Bloomberg that gay is wrong. Love is between woman and man.' The two men shouted across the subway car in New York . The gay man called on other passengers to support him and shouted: 'Jesus is love. You are not of God, you are not of love. 'There's love on this train. Everyone for love let's clap. Love wins.' Other passengers applaud him and can be heard whooping and shouting: 'Yes, love!' The incident, which happened Saturday, is not the first time homophobic incidents on public transport have been filmed by passengers. In 2009, a woman was filmed on a train in New York singing a reggae anti-gay song, which featured the lyrics: 'Me no like lesbian, leave me alone, stop following me around.' Another video from Portland, Oregan, shows a woman telling men traveling back from a Pride parade in 2011: 'Do you know you won't go to Heaven?'

"The High Speed 2 rail project has faced many challenges  in its ambitious attempt to link the North of England with London. But transport chiefs have now picked a fight with a new foe – the hard-partying, celebrity Primrose Hill Set. Hundreds of residents of the affluent North London neighbourhood, which has been home to supermodel Kate Moss and actor Jude Law, are furious after being told their multi-million pound homes could be seized to make way for the scheme. Hundreds of residents of the affluent North London neighbourhood Primrose Hill, which has been home to supermodel Kate Moss and actor Jude Law, are furious after being told their multi-million pound homes could be seized to make way for the scheme . They include shopping expert Mary Portas, the Government’s high street tsar, who has been warned that her £4.5million Georgian home could be subject to a compulsory purchase order. Under the power, authorities have the legal right to buy the property at market value to allow major public projects to proceed. She and other residents live near the route of a proposed tunnel, and as part of the work engineers need to replace a Victorian sewer underneath their homes. Those with basements converted into bedrooms, gyms, offices and wine cellars fear they could lose the space to make way for the work. Homeowners fear the threat from the official letters alone could reduce their house prices. Properties affected include an Italian restaurant popular with Labour leader Ed Miliband and a pub frequented by BBC presenter Andrew Marr and the mid-1990s ‘Primrose Hill Set’ including Ewan McGregor, Rhys Ifans and Sadie Frost. A spokesman for HS2 said it was meeting its legal obligations by writing to residents. And while it has the permission to seize properties, the firm would only do so ‘if required’. Mary Portas, the Government's high street tsar, has been warned that her £4.5million Georgian home could be subject to a compulsory purchase order . Some cellars may also extend beyond the property, added the spokesman. Miss Portas declined to comment. The letters were sent following the publication of a 50,000-page document detailing the environmental impact of phase one of the £50billion scheme, which is due to be put before both houses in April. Prime Minister David Cameron has described HS2 as a ‘vital investment’ that will provide a high-speed link from Manchester and Leeds to London via Birmingham. The latest letters were sent following the publication of a 50,000-page document detailing the environmental damage by the proposed London to Birmingham phase one of the railway construction. It is part of a Parliamentary Standing Order before the hybrid bill to approve the £50billion scheme is due to be put before both houses in April. A spokesman for the HS2 project said while it has the permission to compulsory purchase affected properties, it did not intend to do so at this stage. He said: ‘The works involve replacing the old sewer that runs under Princess Road. The houses on this road have cellars, which might extend beyond the property. ‘In order to meet the legal requirements of the Parliamentary Standing Order, we are required to notify the property owners about the proposed works. HS2 Ltd does not intend to acquire or gain access to the cellars. 'However, the powers in the Bill would allow us to do so if required.’","Celebrity Primrose Hill Set have been told homes could be seized for scheme .

'His hand was bleeding but there seemed to be a lot more blood on him than was coming from the hand wound. 'After treatment in hospital, he told us that he had been drinking his victim's blood. These claims are being investigated.' When questioned by police, the suspect was only able to speak in English, and also spoke about the Baltic state where he claims to come from.

"The father of the Indian diplomat at the center of a slave wage controversy has now accused the housekeeper of being a CIA mole. Uttam Khobragade, a former bureaucrat, accused daughter Devyani's housekeeper of the espionage during a bizarre press conference Thursday in Mumbai. Sources also confirmed the family's suspicions of maid Sangeeta Richard's spying to Mail Today hot on the heels of revelations she enjoyed working for Ms Kobragade. Concerned: Uttam Khobragade, father of arrested Indian diplomat Devyani Khobragade, has accused her former housekeeper of being a CIA mole . Scapegoat: Mr Khobragade railed against the US government, saying the ordeal was a plot to ruin his daughter Devyani's reputation . The worried father told reporters gathered in the Indian capital that he believes Ms Richard's accusations are part of a plot to ruin his daughter. 'Going by the developments that have taken place over the last one year, the government of India feels that it appears to be a conspiracy,' Mr Khobragade said, according to the Economic Times. 'Also from the given circumstances, we suspect that Sangeeta Richards is an agent of the CIA,' he continued. 'We were made scapegoat in the whole case. Devyani is a brave woman and she has been performing all her duties regularly. His comments just before sources told Mail Today the housekeeper was 'unusually curious during her stay with Devyani in the US.' Ms Khobragade, 39, wasn't carrying any high-value information, sources said, but she was living at the Indian mission to the United Nations - where diplomats posted to both the Indian Consulate and the UN also stay. The accuser could have been 'a live bug planted inside the residential building of India's mission to the UN,' sources suspect. 'Slave': Sangeeta Richard, with her husband Philip, who worked as a driver at the Embassy of Mozambique in Delhi, pictured in January 2010 - according to her mother in law she had always wanted to work abroad . Every day a smile: Sangeeta's first impressions and description of her employer Devyani Khobragade, above, were positive as she embarked on her life in service in New York . Many believe Ms Khobragade's 'ties to a senior diplomat,' as well as her mother's work for another diplomat, made her a prime target. A spokesperson for Safe Horizon, the victim assistance agency working with Ms Richards, told the New York Daily News that his client is not a CIA agent. This bizarre turn came after  a leaked letter home written by the disgruntled housekepper revealed her to have given her . family in India a very different account of her life in New York to the . one of ‘virtual slavery’ she has now alleged. The . letter was posted by diplomat Devyani Khobragade’s sister, Sharmistha, . on her Facebook page as part of passionate defence of her sibling and . rebuttal of the allegations leveled against her.It was written in December 2012, just one month after her arrival in New York. Mrs Khobragade does not say how she came to possess the text in which Mrs Richard described the Khobragade family and Dr Khobragade in particular as ‘very nice.’ She wrote: ‘This family is very nice. I’m not feeling I’m her servant. Children call me “Thai” – that means elder brother’s wife. They call me Sangeeta Thai. Madam is very nice. ‘Every day she has a smile.’ Mrs Richard, 42, who is originally from Kerala, went onto claim that she received helped with her maid work allowing her ‘spare time’ and described the house into which the family were about to move: ‘Four bedroom, big sized and one big hall downstairs two rooms, upstairs two rooms. Devyani Khobragade pictured in June 2013, just days before her housekeeper Sangeeta Richard went missing sparking a series of claims and counterclaims that would spiral out of control . ‘My room is separate. Downstairs is lawn.’ She explained that until the family moved in their new home on the Upper East Side they were staying at The Beekman Tower Hotel and added: ‘Their window looks out at very nice buildings.’ She said that every day she prayed for her mother before going to sleep and promised to call and talk on Facebook ‘when master gives me a new SIM.’ 'She ended the letter, written in Hindi, with the admission: ‘I am trying to talk in English but I can’t – I forget. So bad :) Sangeeta.’ Attorney Dana Sussman, is representing Sangeeta Richard, she says the real story of the alleged fraud has been lost in the diplomatic row . Earlier her mother-in-law Agnes, told the Indian Express, that Sangeeta had 'always wanted to work abroad.' She said: 'I had reservations about the marriage but my son was in a hurry.' The couple courted for three years before marrying. Agnes, claimed Mrs Richard left the marital home after just three days - returning only when she learned she was pregnant. Following the birth of a daughter the couple moved to Fatehpur Beri in southwest Delhi. Mrs Richard has not responded directly to the letter. But attorney Dana Sussman, who is representing her though the non-profit victim assistance agency Safe Horizon last night spoke of her ‘frustration and disappointment’ that focus had slipped from ‘crimes that were committed’ to ‘the criminal defendant.’ She pointed out that the case was about Dr Khobragade allegedly lying to the federal government about the wages she was paying Mrs Richard. Mrs Richard has claimed she as paid just $3.31 an hour, below minium wage. In a statement to the Press Trust of India Mrs Sussman said: ‘Dr Khobragade did not pay those wages, she grossly underpaid my client and required that my client work far more than she had expected. In the dock: An artist's sketch of Devyani Khobragade at her arraignment in Manhattan Federal Court in December . Protesters in the eastern Indian city of Bhubaneswar, burn an effigy of Barack Obama during the international fall-out of Dr Khobragade's domestic dispute . ‘My client worked for her for quite a while and eventually she decided she could not tolerate the situation any longer.’ She refused to comment on her clients and her family’s whereabouts. Mrs Richard’s husband Philip, and parents flew into America two days before police swooped on Dr Khobragade and arresting her at the gates of her daughter’s Upper East Side school. Since then the case has escalated to a state of international crisis.  News that a female diplomat had been strip-searched and held in a cell with drug addicts and sex workers before posting bail of $250,000 incensed the Indian government and public. US diplomats in India swiftly found many of their privileges rescinded and safety barriers removed from their embassy in New Delhi. Secretary of State John Kerry expressed his ‘regret as well as his concern’ over the incident in a telephone call to Indian National Security Advisor Shivshanker Menon. He spoke of his hope that the ‘close and vital relationship with India’ remain unharmed. But nothing short of dropping the charges – one count of Visa Fraud one of False Statement – against Dr Khobragade seems likely to satisfy Indian authorities in the case which has now been raised in the nation’s parliament. Against this backdrop Mrs Sussman’s statement continued: ‘Mrs Richard is not on trial here and we think that the message here has been lost in the fact that there are charges against Khobragade for violating US law and those charges relate to the underpayment of wages to a domestic worker. ‘That is the story that has been lost in the diplomatic row that has erupted between US and India.’","Sangeeta Richard, 42, from Kerala, was employed as housekeeper to diplomat Devyani Khobragade in November 2012 .

"At 8am, amid a clamour of television crews and world media, Sean Azzariti became the first person to purchase marijuana on the day Colorado made it legally available to anyone over 21. For the thirty-two year old veteran his $59 purchase of an eighth of an ounce and a marijuana infused truffle marks the culmination of a fight both deeply personal and highly publicly. Mr Azzariti is a former Marine who served two tours of duty in Iraq and Afghanistan. He uses marijuana to mitigate the crippling Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) he has suffered since returning home. Sean Azzariti, a former Marine who served in the Iraq war and has post-traumatic stress disorder, smiles as he makes a cash transaction, the first to buy retail marijuana at 3D Cannabis Center, which opened as a legal recreational retail outlet in Denver, on Wednesday, January 1, 2014 . In an interview with MailOnline he said: 'For me this is a huge opportunity and the culmination of what I and so many others have worked so hard for. 'I hope it's a stepping stone to other states following and the rest of the world.' Taking in the chaotic scenes in the small Denver dispensary he admitted: 'It's pretty surreal.' Mr Azzariti has been the face of the Yes to Amendment 64 campaign form more than a year. His advocacy was inspired not only by his own experiences but by his awareness of the suffering of many of his former brothers in arms. First purchase: Azzariti shows his receipt from first purchase of retail marijuana in Colorado. 3-D Cannabis in Denver hosted a media event to record the first legal retail sale at 8:00 a.m. All too often, he said, veterans fall into lives of addiction, depression and desperation once their days of combat are over. He explained: 'I have a lot of friends who are addicted to Xanax and antidepressants – all sorts of prescription drugs because they're trying to deal with the same things I am. 'They wouldn’t dream of trying marijuana because of the stigma. 'I want to say, ""Look I've done the same thing as you and I've been there and this helped me."" It may not be for you but just give it a try.' Mr Azzariti served with the Marines between 2000 and 2006. He carried out two tours of duty – Iraq in 2003 and Afghanistan in 2005. His contract had been due to an end a year before that final tour of duty but, he said, 'My best friend got orders to deploy again. I couldn't let him go alone so I re-enlisted for a couple of years to deploy.' It was only when he was back in civilian life that, he recalled, 'PTSD started to steadily rear its head and take over my life.' Queues: People wait in line to be among the first to legally buy recreational marijuana at the Botana Care store in Northglenn, Colorado on January 1 . He sought traditional remedies, but said: 'Doctors just prescribed more and more pills – they were treating my symptoms but not my problems.' At one point Mr Azzariti was taking 6mg of Xanax a day 4mg of Klonopin and Aderol to keep him awake. He said: 'That's when I turned to cannabis. I wasn't a smoker but I'm just glad I had the wherewithal to realize I was going to turn into a zombie if something didn't change.' Mr Azzarati, now works as a budtender at a Denver dispensary. He is in no doubt, he said: 'Cannabis saved me when PTSD was just overwhelming me.' Now he said: 'I feel I can help others through my experience. I think my military experience has given me the discipline to be able to turn my marijuana use into advocacy. 'My life now is the polar opposite to what it was in the marines and I love it. It’s awesome.'","At 8am, amid a clamor of television .

"Nigel Farage yesterday said 'the basic principle' behind parts of Enoch Powell's notorious Rivers of Blood speech was right . Nigel Farage yesterday said ‘the basic principle’ behind parts of Enoch Powell’s notorious Rivers of Blood speech was right. The UKIP leader was asked if he agreed with a statement about how the ‘indigenous population found themselves strangers in their own country’. He said it was true – but appeared thrown when he was told the statement was made by the controversial Tory minister of the 1960s. The passage from the speech read to Mr Farage was: ‘The indigenous population found themselves made strangers in their own country, their wives unable to obtain hospital beds in childbirth, their children unable to obtain school places, their homes and neighbourhoods changed beyond recognition.’ Mr Farage said it was true ‘in a lot of England’ – before being told on Sky News that it was part of the 1968 warning of racial violence that led to Mr Powell being sacked from the Tory front bench and politically marginalised. He said: ‘Is it? Well, what he was warning about is that if you have a large influx of people into an area that changes an area beyond recognition, there is tension, that basic principle is right.’ Asked if Mr Powell ‘saw it coming’, he replied: ‘Well no ... for different reasons, for different reasons and on a completely different scale. ‘I mean when immigration was being discussed in the 60s and 70s and 80s we were talking about an annual net inflow to the country of between 30,000 and 50,000 people. ‘What we have had in the last 13 years is net four million extra migrants who have come to Britain so we are dealing with something now on a scale that hitherto we couldn’t even have conceived.’ Mr Farage was read part of the 1968 warning of racial violence that led to Enoch Powell being sacked from the Tory front bench and politically marginalised . In 2008, Mr Farage courted controversy by naming Mr Powell as his political hero in an interview and saying the country would be better today if his words had been heeded. He said at the time: ‘I would never say that Powell was racist in any way at all.’ Mr Powell, then shadow defence spokesman, had told a Conservative association meeting that Britain was mad to allow in 50,000 dependants of immigrants every year – and compared it to a nation building its own funeral pyre. He said: ‘Like the Roman, I see the river Tiber foaming with much blood.’ Mr Powell lost his job after the speech, which was denounced by Tory leader Edward Heath.","UKIP leader was asked if he agreed ‘indigenous population' were strangers in their own country, before being told it was part of Powell's speech .

"Victim: Timothy 'Asti' Davison was shot dead in a highway altercation that investigators now believe was a random act of road rage . Police have concluded that a 28-year-old Maine man was killed in a seemingly random act of road rage on Sunday. Timothy 'Asti' Davison was driving up the East Coast from Florida to Maine when he called 911 in Northern Maryland as he was being shot at by a trailing vehicle. Davison called from Interstate 81 near Maryland early Saturday to say someone in a pickup truck was firing on him. The call was dropped and he called again, this time having crossed over the border into Pennsylvania. According to police, Davison was forced into a median, disabling his vehicle, before the assailant approached and fired several rounds at him. 'I think we can call it a road rage incident,' Pennsylvania state trooper Rob Hicks told The Portland Press Herald. 'At this point we haven’t found anything that would connect the two men.' Police . are not releasing the recordings of the calls, but Mr Hicks said that . Davison indicated that a driving issue- like one person cutting another . off or braking suddenly- may have sparked the problem. The only clues that the investigators- who have been joined by FBI teams- are basing their investigation off of are the grainy surveillance footage and bullet remnants. Scroll down for video . Road rage: Timothy Davison called from Interstate 81 near Maryland early Saturday to say someone in a pickup truck was firing on him just moments before he was forced off the road (pictured) and shot dead . State police are searching for a Ford . Ranger-style pickup. They say the vehicle may be blue and may have . damage to the driver's side. They say Davison, who was from Poland, Maine, died at a York hospital following the 2.10am attack. Police say the attack occurred on northbound I-81 in Antrim Township, about 10 miles north of Hagerstown, Maryland. According to police reports, Davison . called 911 in Maryland shortly before 2am to report that he was being . pursued by another motorist, but his call was dropped when he crossed . into Pennsylvania. Davison, . by then under fire, reached emergency dispatchers in Franklin County on . the phone, but moments later was forced off the road and shot. The circumstances of the fatal altercation are strikingly similar to those of a shooting that took place just three days earlier in Monaghan Township, Pennsylvania that is just 30 miles away from the scene of Davison's death. Crime scene: Davison's attack occurred on northbound I-81 in Antrim Township, about 10 miles north of Hagerstown, Maryland, as Davison was driving home to Maine after visiting family in Florida . 'I just hope this doesn’t happen to . anyone else. This wasn’t just road rage. This person is obviously . crazy,' the victim's mother Theresa Alloca told The Kennebec Journal. According to Bangor Daily News, . Davison had worked for five years as a pipefitter and foreman at a . Maine-based company co-owned by his father, also name Timothy Davison. The elder Mr Davison told Portland Press Herald that . his son was returning home Saturday after traveling to Florida to visit . relatives for the holidays. He apparently chose Interstate 81 to avoid . traffic. 'He was a great kid,' Mr Davison said of his slain son. The 28-year-old attended a technical school in Arizona to learn how to fix motorcycles before taking a job with his father's company in Raymond, Maine. Police investigating the incident are not sure what prompted the attack, or if Davison had a prior history with his assailant. abc27 WHTM .","Timothy 'Asti' Davison, 28, was driving from Florida to Maine and a driver behind him started firing shots while they were on a Maryland highway .

"Her allegations of abuse have seen her diplomat employer arrested and triggered an international furor. But now, a leaked letter home, written by housekeeper Sangeeta Richard, reveals her to have given her family in India a very different account of her life in New York to the one of ‘virtual slavery’ she has now alleged. The letter was posted by diplomat Devyani Khobragade’s sister, Sharmistha, on her Facebook page as part of passionate defence of her sibling and rebuttal of the allegations leveled against her.It was written in December 2012, just one month after her arrival in New York. 'Slave': Sangeeta Richard, with her husband Philip, who worked as a driver at the Embassy of Mozambique in Delhi, pictured in January 2010 - according to her mother in law she had always wanted to work abroad . Every day a smile: Sangeeta's first impressions and description of her employer Devyani Khobragade, above, were positive as she embarked on her life in service in New York . Mrs Khobragade does not say how she came to possess the text in which Mrs Richard described the Khobragade family and Dr Khobragade in particular as ‘very nice.’ She wrote: ‘This family is very nice. I’m not feeling I’m her servant. Children call me “Thai” – that means elder brother’s wife. They call me Sangeeta Thai. Madam is very nice. ‘Every day she has a smile.’ Mrs Richard, 42, who is originally from Kerala, went onto claim that she received helped with her maid work allowing her ‘spare time’ and described the house into which the family were about to move: ‘Four bedroom, big sized and one big hall downstairs two rooms, upstairs two rooms. Devyani Khobragade pictured in June 2013, just days before her housekeeper Sangeeta Richard went missing sparking a series of claims and counterclaims that would spiral out of control . ‘My room is separate. Downstairs is lawn.’ She explained that until the family moved in their new home on the Upper East Side they were staying at The Beekman Tower Hotel and added: ‘Their window looks out at very nice buildings.’ She said that every day she prayed for her mother before going to sleep and promised to call and talk on Facebook ‘when master gives me a new SIM.’ 'She ended the lett er, written in Hindi, with the admission: ‘I am trying to talk in English but I can’t – I forget. So bad :) Sangeeta.’ Attorney Dana Sussman, is representing Sangeeta Richard, she says the real story of the alleged fraud has been lost in the diplomatic row . Earlier her mother-in-law Agnes, told the Indian Express, that Sangeeta had 'always wanted to work abroad.' She said: 'I had reservations about the marriage but my son was in a hurry.' The couple courted for three years before marrying. Agnes, claimed Mrs Richard left the marital home after just three days - returning only when she learned she was pregnant. Following the birth of a daughter the couple moved to Fatehpur Beri in southwest Delhi. Mrs Richard has not responded directly to the letter. But attorney Dana Sussman, who is representing her though the non-profit victim assistance agency Safe Horizon last night spoke of her ‘frustration and disappointment’ that focus had slipped from ‘crimes that were committed’ to ‘the criminal defendant.’ She pointed out that the case was about Dr Khobragade allegedly lying to the federal government about the wages she was paying Mrs Richard. Mrs Richard has claimed she as paid just $3.31 an hour, below minium wage. In a statement to the Press Trust of India Mrs Sussman said: ‘Dr Khobragade did not pay those wages, she grossly underpaid my client and required that my client work far more than she had expected. In the dock: An artist's sketch of Devyani Khobragade at her arraignment in Manhattan Federal Court in December . Protesters in the eastern Indian city of Bhubaneswar, burn an effigy of Barack Obama during the international fall-out of Dr Khobragade's domestic dispute . ‘My client worked for her for quite a while and eventually she decided she could not tolerate the situation any longer.’ She refused to comment on her clients and her family’s whereabouts. Mrs Richard’s husband Philip, and parents flew into America two days before police swooped on Dr Khobragade and arresting her at the gates of her daughter’s Upper East Side school. Since then the case has escalated to a state of international crisis.  News that a female diplomat had been strip-searched and held in a cell with drug addicts and sex workers before posting bail of $250,000 incensed the Indian government and public. US diplomats in India swiftly found many of their privileges rescinded and safety barriers removed from their embassy in New Delhi. Secretary of State John Kerry expressed his ‘regret as well as his concern’ over the incident in a telephone call to Indian National Security Advisor Shivshanker Menon. He spoke of his hope that the ‘close and vital relationship with India’ remain unharmed. But nothing short of dropping the charges – one count of Visa Fraud one of False Statement – against Dr Khobragade seems likely to satisfy Indian authorities in the case which has now been raised in the nation’s parliament. Against this backdrop Mrs Sussman’s statement continued: ‘Mrs Richard is not on trial here and we think that the message here has been lost in the fact that there are charges against Khobragade for violating US law and those charges relate to the underpayment of wages to a domestic worker. ‘That is the story that has been lost in the diplomatic row that has erupted between US and India.’","Sangeeta Richard, 42, from Kerala was employed as housekeeper to diplomat Devyani Khobragade in November 2012 .

"Some 1,000 top bankers at HSBC are to be given a multi-million pound shares windfall in a bid to avoid an EU cap on bonuses. The lender asked shareholders to design a system that complies with the Brussels edict while still rewarding staff – and avoiding an exodus of valued staff to Asian and US rivals. It claims the shares do not qualify as a bonus because it forms part of their fixed pay package. Scheme: Some banks have been accused of trying to avoid a bonus cap by giving staff multi-million-pound share windfalls . Unlike bonuses, fixed pay cannot be clawed back from reckless staff or those embroiled in wrongdoing. HSBC . has been speaking to some of its biggest shareholders to come up with a . system which complies with the edict from Brussels while avoiding . cutting pay for staff. Banks . claim the cap - which applies to staff worldwide -  will cause their . best employees to leave for Asian and US rivals which do not have such . restrictions. Under fire: Campaigners have accused HSBC of 'concocting elaborate schemes' so they can continue paying seven figure sums to staff . But last night campaigners blasted lenders like HSBC and Barclays for ‘concocting elaborate schemes’ so they can continue to dish out seven figure awards to staff. The bonus cap, imposed by Brussels . this month, restricts bonuses to a maximum of one year’s annual salary, . rising to double that if shareholders approve. HSBC’s . open show of defiance comes as the Government mounts a legal challenge . against the cap, saying it encourages banks to raise fixed pay and . promote risk-taking. Anger: Bankers at Barclays have been slammed for devising a scheme to avoid a cap on bonuses . Unlike bonuses, fixed pay cannot be clawed back from reckless staff or those embroiled in wrongdoing. Staff will not be able to cash the shares in for five years. Shareholders will be asked to vote on  the new system in May. Investors at all the UK banks will also be asked to vote on whether to hand bonuses worth more than one year’s salary to staff. Barclays has already introduced a system to avoid the bonus cap by introducing monthly cash payments for top staff. Luke Hildyard, from the High Pay Centre, said there was no ‘convincing argument’ for payments to retain HSBC staff. He said: ‘Rather than concocting elaborate schemes to dodge the bonus cap, HSBC and other banks should be engaging in an open debate on why bankers are paid so much more than everyone else and what would be fair and proportionate.’ He added: ‘We have not seen a convincing argument that these kind of payments are necessary to retain HSBC staff, nor is there much evidence that top bankers are as indispensable as they claim.’ Some 204 staff at HSBC received a pay package worth more than £1 million in 2012, with 78 of those based in the UK. Chief executive Stuart Gulliver received £7.4 million in pay and perks for 2012, despite the bank being fined £1.2 billion in the US for laundering money for drugs gangs and terrorists. The news comes as Britain’s biggest banks prepare to reveal over the next few weeks how much they dished out in bonuses last year as they publish their annual reports.","Campaigners say lenders are 'concocting elaborate schemes' to avoid cap .

"British expat Garin Dart, 41, who left his pregnant wife and son in Japan in May is now living in Yorkshire and says he was threatened by Japanese mafia . A British businessman who was feared dead after he disappeared in Japan is safe and well and living in Yorkshire. Friends of events company manager Garin Dart, 41, believed he had been kidnapped or killed when he abandoned his pregnant wife and their four-year-old son with no warning eight months ago. Japanese and British authorities launched a manhunt for the popular ex-pat, who had lived in Tokyo for 10 years, and friends ran online and poster campaigns to find him. But police in Tokyo dropped their investigation when they discovered he had withdrawn £40,000 from his company and left the country. In fact, Mr Dart is alive and back in Britain after going on the run. He claims he was forced to flee secretly after being threatened by the Japanese mafia. Mr Dart had been a successful businessman, whose company Bluesilver put on lavish events for international businesses and the Japanese royal family. He also co-founded an aid charity in the wake of the 2011 tsunami. His high-flying lifestyle meant he took several exotic holidays a year with wife Yukako, 39. But his habit of frequenting five-star hotels and restaurants brought him into contact with mafia bosses. He said: ‘We would go out drinking to bars and clubs. They would have a lot of contacts and with my contacts in the hospitality industry we would be welcomed wherever we went. ‘It was a mutually beneficial friendship.’ Mr Dart said he was aware of his friends’ backgrounds but never did business with them. ‘You go out socially with a few people and you find out there a few bad lads in the bunch, but you don’t get involved,’ he added. ‘I just took them at face value, they seemed nice.’ But his life turned upside-down when one ‘gangster’ drunkenly informed him of plans to murder another friend. He warned the friend so he could escape, but claims he was then threatened by the gangster who had let slip the information. ‘He said he would kill me and hurt my pregnant wife and son,’ he said. ‘It was terrifying. I feared something would happen to my family and I knew I was in trouble.’ Abandoned: Mr Dart left his pregnant wife Yukako, 39, left, and four-year-old son, pictured, in May . Family he left behind: Garin Dart, pictured with his wife and elder son, enjoyed a luxurious lifestyle in Japan . Mr Dart kept his ordeal from his friends and family while he offered the mafia £30,000 to drop the threats. He withdrew £40,000 from his business, keeping £10,000 aside ‘just in case’. But when he handed the cash over, he claimed the mafia made further threats and warned him to ‘disappear’. He said: ‘I couldn’t go to the police, it wouldn’t have helped. ‘If the mafia say they will kill you, they will. But if they say you are safe, you are safe. ‘When they said they would leave my family alone if I disappeared, I believed them.’ Mr Dart fled to Thailand the same day wearing only a t-shirt and jeans, without a word to his wife or business partners. ‘The biggest mistake I made was I . didn’t get in contact with anybody,’ he said. ‘If I was thinking . straight I would have sent a message to my family and colleagues saying I . was in trouble and needed to go away. ‘But . I didn’t know what to do, I was scared. I turned my phone off. I didn’t . log in to any of my online accounts. I was worried the mafia would find . me.’ Mr Dart, pictured on holiday in Hawaii with his wife in 2010, ran a successful events management firm in Tokyo . Now: Mr Dart has been back in the UK since October, but has not yet met his younger son, born a few weeks ago . Within days Mrs Dart had reported her husband missing and his father Robert, 64, had contacted the Foreign Office. A fortnight later police told the family he had left the country, but would not reveal where he had gone because of strict Japanese privacy laws. After months on the run through southeast Asia, he was finally persuaded to contact his family by a stranger whom he spilled his story to in a street café. He said: ‘My money was running out. My options were narrowing. I was feeling suicidal. ‘After a while the fear for my life had died down, but then I had the fear and guilt over what happened to my family. I thought what are they going to think of me?’ After contacting his sister Samantha, 44, through Facebook, he found the courage to speak to his father in Lincolnshire over the phone and was convinced to return to England. ‘I couldn’t speak to my wife or my mother. It was just too emotional,’ he said. 'After a while, the fear for my life had died down, but then I had the fear and guilt over what happened to my family. 'I thought: ""What are they going to think of me?""' - British expat Garin Dart, 41, who fled his Tokyo home eight months ago . Mr Dart arrived in the UK in October and found a job within a month. He has since got back in touch with his wife. He said: ‘She was upset. She was angry that I hadn’t got in touch. That is the biggest thing I regret. ‘She is OK now but we had some pretty heavy conversations the first few times we talked. It is still difficult, she is still angry.’ Mrs Dart had the couple’s second child, a boy, a few weeks ago. Mr Dart does not know when he will meet his son as he fears he can never go back to Japan, but hopes to meet his wife soon. Mr Dart said: ‘I don’t know about the future. In Tokyo I had a great lifestyle. I had a couple of nice cars on the drive, houses, a great business. I had my wife and child. ‘There has been speculation about why I left, but that is not something I would have run away from for £40,000. ‘I wouldn’t have wanted any other lifestyle. I worked hard to make that happen.’ In July Tokyo police said they had stopped looking for Mr Dart and that there had been no criminal complaints against him. Mr Dart insists he was entitled to the money he took through sales of shares. His family have since paid it back. A Foreign Office spokesman confirmed he was ‘no longer missing’. Mr Dart enjoyed a glamorous social life in Japan but says it meant he often mixed with members of the local mafia .","Garin Dart, 41, abandoned pregnant wife and son without warning in May .

"A cruel Chinese female doctor who told mothers their new-born babies had died, but had secretly sold them, has been given a suspended death sentence. Obstetrician Zhang Shuxia, 55, was found guilty of stealing seven babies after telling their parents the newborns were sick or had died - before selling the children to traffickers for £2,255 for females and £5,240 for males. The court in Weinan city, in Fuping county, was told that six of the babies were recovered safely by police and returned to their parents - but one was found dead in a ditch, where it had been dumped by a trafficker for unknown reasons. Zhang Shuxia, an obstetrician involved in baby trafficking, standing trial in Weinan Intermediate People's Court in Weinan, Shaanxi province in December. She was handed a suspended death sentence for stealing seven babies and selling them to traffickers . Evidence against Zhang showed that on one occasion she had persuaded a mother to give up her newborn female twins on the grounds that one had died of a disease and the other had injured arms and legs. Zhang was sentenced to death with a two-year reprieve, meaning that if she offends again in a similar way in that time she will be shot. But it is unlikely she will have any chance of repeating the crime because it is suggested by observers that her sentence will probably be commuted to life in prison. It is believed Zhang sold many more children than the seven she was charged with stealing. According to reports received by police, some 26 babies were stolen from their mothers and Zhang was named as the main suspect. The obstetrician was arrested after a young couple claimed their baby had been abducted in July last year. Hundreds of babies have been rescued after police in China launched a crackdown on four baby trafficking websites. Nearly 2,000 suspects were arrested as a result of the nationwide operation . Police said that Zhang told them their son had caught hepatitis B and syphillis from them, yet doctors had told them they were free of both diseases. The couple were among the fortunate parents whose baby was returned to them. Zhang's suspended death sentence has outraged many Chinese internet users, one writer on Sina Weibo - China's equivalent of Twitter - insisting: 'She should die. She is the shame of the medical profession.' Another demanded that 'the death penalty should be carried out immediately.' Under China's strict population control policies, most couples can have only one child. Those who have more than one have secretly made money by selling the second-born to traffickers - particularly if that baby is a boy. But times might be changing - legislatures recently endorsed a resolution easing the one-child policy allowing couple to have two babies if either parent is an only child.","Zhang Shuxia, 55, stole seven babies and sold them to traffickers .

"He has endured a few political storms in his time. So Nigel Farage relished the opportunity to predict the weather himself, as he took a light-hearted view of UKIP's recent gaffes in a spoof forecast. The Eurosceptic party leader also pulled no punches pointing out the more unsavoury elements of his Westminster rivals in a mock sequence on the BBC's Sunday Politics show. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Spoof: Mr Farage delivered a satirical take on the weather for the BBC's Sunday Politics . 'Barmy': The broadcast warned that all political parties contain people with unpalatable views . Mr Farage took the chance to respond to fury at remarks by David Silvester, a UKIP councillor who was suspended for linking recent flooding in Britain to the legalisation of gay marriage. Mr Silvester caused outrage - and was suspended from the party - after he wrote a letter to his local paper in Henley-on-Thames saying that extreme weather was a punishment visited upon Britain by God after David Cameron pushed through new legislation. But Mr Farage brushed the incident off as 'a storm in a teacup' and reminded viewers that other parties also harbour embarrassing elements. 'Storm in a teacup': Mr Farage sought to play down the implications of UKIP councillor David Silvester's remarks linking gay marriage with flooding . Scandal: Mr Farage raised the case of Tory MP Aidan Burley, who organised a Nazi-themed party in a French ski resort . He told viewers to beware of 'outbreaks of sometimes barmy, occasionally extremist views from people of all political persuasions'. Mr Farage then named-checked Simon Parkes, a Labour councillor in Whitby, who claims that his 'real mother' is a 9ft green alien with eight fingers, as will as a Lib Dem in Wales who was jailed after setting off explosions. Mr Farage also touched on the scandal of Tory MP Aidan Burley, who organised a Nazi-themed party in a French ski resort. The Mail on Sunday today published further claims that Mr Burley had lied to a formal inquiry into his behaviour. He opened his mock broadcast by promising to cover the weather for 'All areas of the British Isles... but definitely not Bongo Bongo land', in reference to remarks by former UKIP MEP Godfrey Bloom attacking the UK's commitment to international aid. 'Avoid light aircraft': The UKIP leader made a self-deprecating reference to the 2010 plane crash he was involved in . Typical: The spoof sequence inevitably showed Mr Farage against a backdrop of beer . The political fortunes of his party also got a mentioned, as Mr Farage focussed on 'rising temperatures' ahead of the European elections this May, in which UKIP hopes to make significant gains. In a self-deprecating move he also advised viewers to 'avoid light aircraft' - a reference to his own misfortunes on the day of the last general election. Mr Farage was rushed to hospital on 6 May 2010 after the light aircraft he was flying in crashed in a field. The plane was dragging a UKIP campaign banner behind it. The UKIP leader was also unable to resist taking a swipe at the European Union. He diverted from the UK's weather to warn that anyone visiting Brussels, where the European Parliament sits, faces 'a warm front of relentless hot air'.","Mr Farage gave a spoof forecast to BBC's Sunday Politics show .

Dangerously close: A firefighting helicopter passes over the hills behind homes as a wildfire burns just north of the San Gabriel Valley community of Glendora . The Los Angeles County Fire Department deployed seven engines and three helicopters to the fire, which was reported around 5:50 a.m. (PST) and was growing rapidly. Officials added to the firefighting aircraft with a water-dropping Super Scooper plane. The fire erupted abruptly, said Jonathan Lambert, general manager of Classic Coffee in Glendora. 'All of a sudden a customer came in, ""Have you seen the fire?"" ""No, we haven't."" We went outside and it's been moving incredibly quickly down that hill,' Lambert told KNBC-TV. The last catastrophic fire in the San Gabriel Mountains broke out in 2009 and burned for months. The flames blackened 250 square miles, killed two firefighters and destroyed 209 structures, including 89 homes. California is in a historically dry era and winter has brought no relief.

Eerie: Cathy Doherty waits to be evacuated from her home as smoke has filled the sky in the Los Angeles valley . Large parts of Southern California below mountain passes, canyons and foothills have been buffeted all week by the region's notorious Santa Ana winds. Spawned by surface high pressure over the interior of the West, the Santa Anas form as the cold air flows toward Southern California, then speeds up and warms as it descends in a rush toward the coast. Some of the most extreme gusts reported by the National Weather Service topped 70 mph. These offshore winds also raise temperatures to summerlike levels. Many areas have enjoyed temperatures well into the 80s. California is also under the influence of a persistent upper-level ridge of high pressure anchored off its north coast that has also kept the region generally warm, dry and clear. A group of 27 orange-clad Los Angeles County Inmate Firefighters are among the 800 or so personnel tackling the Colby fire. Under a scheme developed by the county, eligible prisoners are transferred from Los Angeles County Jail to the Los Angeles County Fire Department Inmate Fire Suppression Camps. ‘This is a way to keep them out of county jail, offer them training and an education’, said Nicole Nishida, spokesman for the LA County Sheriff’s Department. One incentive for working on a county fire crew is that each day of work equals a day off their remaining sentence.

"Tiny birds, bees and butterflies are to be tracked from space from next year to give us advance warnings of volcanic eruptions and earthquakes. Astronauts are planning to install a dedicated wildlife receiver to the International Space Station, which will continuously track the course of thousands of small animals. New technology means radio transmitters are getting smaller and smaller, meaning even insects could soon carry one. Animals are known to sense tectonic activity well before major seismic shifts - an ability which could be used to give us prior warning for natural disasters. Tracking the mass migration of birds and other animals could help warn of natural disasters as they are known to sense tectonic activity well before seismic shifts . Uschi Müller, co-ordinator of the £33million Icarus project, said birds and animals living near disaster-prone zones could be fitted with the devices. ‘It could give people an extra five hours warning of a disaster,’ she said. The devices could also help track and predict the spreads of animal-borne diseases such as Sars, bird flu and West Nile Virus. Some 70 per cent of worldwide epidemics result from animal-human contact, but without long-distance tracking it is hard to predict where they will spread. The Icarus scheme, a joint project run by the German and Russian space agencies and 12 scientific groups, will start by putting transmitters on small birds but hopes to be tracking insects within a few years. Uschi Müller told the Observer: ‘To start with, Icarus scientists will use 5g transmitters but in the future we will use much smaller ones, under 1g, which will allow us to follow insects. ‘It will be used for conservation, health and disaster forecasting.’ At the moment only large animals which have long-range migration patterns are tracked, mainly because of the technological challenges of following animals over many miles. Scientists behind the project say only a satellite-based system can provide a solution to the problem. It could help give up to five hours extra warning of volcanic eruptions, such as Mount Sinabung's earlier this month in Karo district, Indonesia's North Sumatra province . The Icarus receiver will circle on the space station 200 miles above Earth - a relatively low orbit - allowing even bats and bugs to be tracked. Scientists are not sure why animals are able to sense tectonic shifts well before humans or even, in some cases, before seismic monitoring equipment. Colonies of birds, insects, frogs and snakes are reported to have abandoned their habitats hours or even days before a earthquake has struck. One theory is that animals that live in or near groundwater are highly sensitive to any changes in its chemistry, so they might sense subtle alterations caused by chemical changes underground well before tectonic movements. Another explanation is that they are just highly sensitive to vibrations. The Icarus project will also be highly valuable to conservationists. Graham Madge of the RSPB said little is known about the routes migratory birds such as nightingales and spotter fly-catchers take. He said: ‘Understanding the routes they take can help us preserve them and prevent higher than normal rates of infection among wildlife populations. ‘We still don’t know where they go and many are only here for a few months. Without knowing exactly where they go and when we cannot understand how to conserve them.’","Animals are known to sense tectonic activity well before major seismic shifts .

"Separated: Woody Allen with Dylan Farrow. Despite the case being thrown out he was not allowed to see her again . Woody Allen's adopted daughter Dylan Farrow penned an open letter Saturday on a New York Times blog, publicly accusing the controversial filmmaker of sexually assaulting her when she was a young girl. Farrow's first-person account, which appeared on reporter Nicholas Kritoff's blog, marks the first time that Miss Farrow, the daughter of actress Mia Farrow, has directly addressed the alleged sex abuse. In gut-wrenching detail, Dylan Farrow wrote in her statement how at age seven, her adoptive father, Allen, allegedly led her by the hand to a dim attic on the second floor of their house. 'He told me to lay on my stomach and . play with my brother’s electric train set,' Miss Farrow recounted. 'Then . he sexually assaulted me. He talked to me while he did it, whispering . that I was a good girl, that this was our secret, promising that we’d go . to Paris and I’d be a star in his movies.' She noted that to this day, she finds it hard to look at toy trains. Farrow . went on to describe how the award-winning director of 'Annie Hall' and . 'Manhattan' would always find a way to touch her and do things to her . she did not like, including sticking his thumb in her mouth, forcing her . to get into bed with him and placing his head in her naked lap. 'I thought this was how fathers doted on their daughters. But what he did to me in the attic felt different,' she said. Break up: Dylan Farrow with her parents Mia Farrow and Allen in 1987. The filmmaker claims his ex-partner coached their daughter into accusing him of abuse . Unsettling allegations: Farrow, seen left with Allen in Italy in 1991, and with her mother and sister in 1992 (right), wrote how the director would stick his thumb in her mouth, force her to get in bed with him and place his head in her naked lap . Public break-up: Around the time this picture of Allen, Farrow, little Dylan and her brother Ronan was taken in 1992, the actress and filmmaker split following the revelations of sexual abuse . Unable to keep her alleged encounters with her father secret anymore, young Dylan went to her mother, asking her if her own father used to do the same things to her that Allen was doing. The girl's explosive allegations put an end to Farrow and Allen's relationship in 1992, setting off a legal battle in which Dylan claimed the filmmaker accused his former girlfriend of brainwashing her daughter into thinking that he had assaulted her. What followed next was a drawn-out process in which Dylan was dragged from one psychologist to the next, recounting her story over and over again to see if she was lying. In the end, Allen was denied visitation rights with his children, but a Connecicut prosecutor declined to charge him, saying that while there was enough evidence for the case to potentially stand up in court, he was dropping criminal proceedings due to Dylan's fragile state. Allen, 78, has always denied the . allegations of sexual abuse. He was . never charged with, or convicted of, a crime in this case. Hit back: Woody Allen has again been forced to deny claims he abused Dylan Farrow . Keeping a low profile: Allen was accompanied by a retinue of people, but he sought to avoid drawing attention to himself . Hoops fan: Filmmaker Woody Allen, left, leaves late in the fourth quarter of an NBA basketball game between the Miami Heat and the New York Knicks Saturday . Shorlty after Allen and Farrow's split, it was revealed that the filmmaker began . an affair with his adopted daughter Soon-Yi Previn, whom he married in . 1997. On Saturday . night, just hours after the release of his daughter's bombshell letter, a . somber-looking Allen was spotted arriving at a New York Knicks game in . New York with two of his other adopted daughters in tow. In her open letter, . Dylan Farrow claimed that Allen used his ‘sexual relationship’ with her . stepsister, Soon-Yi, to cover up the abuse Dylan herself had allegedly . suffered at his hands. ‘That . he got away with what he did to me haunted me as I grew up,’ Miss . Farrow wrote. ‘I was stricken with guilt that I had allowed him to be . near other little girls.’ Dylan . candidly talked about the effect the alleged ordeal had on her . later life, including a battle with eating disorders and her terror at . being touched by men. The woman also said she began cutting herself. His other girls: Woody Allen exits Madison Square Garden with adopted daughters Bechet Allen and Manzie Allen after watching the New York Knicks lose to the Miami Heat . Scandalous relationship: Dylan Farrow accused her father of using his affair with his adopted daughter Soon-Yi, right, to cover up his abuse of her; the two married in 1997 . Farrow also used her soul-bearing . confession to attack the Hollywood establishment for 'turning a blind . eye' and helping along Allen’s career in the entertainment industry. ‘Most . found it easier to accept the ambiguity, to say, “who can say what . happened,” to pretend that nothing was wrong,’ she said. ‘Actors praised . him at awards shows. Networks put him on TV. Critics put him in . magazines. Final straw: Dylan explained that what prompted her to write the open letter was seeing her adopted father receiving yet another Oscar nomination for his latest film, Blue Jasmine . ‘Each time I saw my abuser’s face – . on a poster, on a t-shirt, on television – I could only hide my panic . until I found a place to be alone and fall apart.’ Dylan . Farrow's decision to offer a first-person account of her torment has . been spurred by Allen's latest nomination for an Academy Award and last . month’s Golden Globes ceremony, where he received the prestigious Cecil B . DeMille Lifetime Achievement Award. ‘It felt like a personal rebuke, like the awards and accolades were a way to tell me to shut up and go away,’ Dylan wrote. Farrow, . who described herself as a happily married woman, did not shy away from . condemning the actors who have starred in her father’s films over the . years, some of whom were on hand January 12 to present Allen with his . Golden Globe. ‘What if it had been you, Emma Stone? Or you, Scarlett Johansson? You knew me when I was a little girl, Diane Keaton. Have you forgotten me?’ she asked. Farrow's family, including her mother and stepbrother Ronan Farrow, have been unwavering in their support of her. On the night of the Golden Globes ceremony, Ronan Farrow, Allen's would-be son, brought up his sister's alleged assault in a scathing tweet. Support system: Both Dylan's mother, actress and activist Mia Farrow (left), and her adopted brother Ronan Farrow (right), have stood by her claims regarding Woody Allen . Strong words: Woody's son and ex-girlfriend weren't happy about him receiving an honour at the Golden Globes . ‘Missed the Woody Allen tribute - did they put the part where a woman publicly confirmed he molested her at age 7 before or after Annie Hall?’ the newly hired MSNBC host wrote. Dylan Farrow concluded her letter with an appeal to the movie-going public to think twice before they rush to heap praise on her talented adoptive father. ‘So imagine your seven-year-old daughter being led into an attic by Woody Allen. Imagine she spends a lifetime stricken with nausea at the mention of his name. Imagine a world that celebrates her tormenter. ‘Are you imagining that? Now, what’s your favorite Woody Allen movie?’ Shaming stars: Dylan lambasted actors like Diane Keaton and Alec Baldwin who had starred in her father's film; Keaton was on hand last month to present Allen with a lifetime achievement award .","Dylan Farrow wrote that Allen sexually assaulted her for first time as she lay staring at a toy train set .

"A Chicago woman has given new meaning to the concept of putting someone under house arrest. The 36-year-old was in the garage of her home in Portage Park, in the Cragin area on the city's northwest side, at about 7.30pm on Saturday. She was suddenly approached by Andre Bacon, 21, from Roseland, who repeatedly demanded the keys to her 2012 Acura MDX, according to The Chicago Tribune. Trapped: Andre Bacon, 21, was held on $75,000 bail after he allegedly tried to steal a woman's car from her garage, only to get trapped inside when the woman closed the garage door . The victim handed them over, but then quickly fled from the garage, smartly shutting the door behind her. The would-be thief was trapped in her garage, which could only be accessed by the door. The woman then ran down the street to call police. When officers arrived a few moments later, they found Bacon trapped inside the garage. He was sitting inside the car with the keys in the ignition, court documents state. Bacon was taken into custody.

"Late night snacking has led to British women becoming bigger than their French counterparts claims chef Raymond Blanc . Late night snacking, too much wine and not cooking with butter has led to British women becoming bigger than their French counterparts claims chef Raymond Blanc. Mr Blanc, who moved to the UK in the 1970s, says it is Britain's culture which has led to females being among the heaviest in Europe. 'One glass of wine a day is better than six! Again, cook with butter  - just use a little and most important, do not eat after 7 o'clock in the evening,' he says. 'That's a big tip because most people eat more at night and that when you put the weight on. Be ware of your snacks as well,' advised the French chef who has recently been teaching Welsh singer Katherine Jenkins how to cook. 'Yes French woman do get fat, but it seems that there is a food culture in France which often defines how people eat and in France we eat well.' 'Eating well, a varied diet, which omits bacon and eggs every morning or six glasses of wine at night, means a better diet,' he told Gransnet. 'One glass of wine a day is better than six! Again, cook with butter  - just use a little and most important, do not eat after 7 o'clock in the evening,' says the TV chef . 'My mother Maman. She's 91 and when I was a boy she gave me a deep understanding of food, its purity and nobility, and how it celebrates life,' he said . Mr Blanc, who credits his mother as his culinary inspiration, also said she was a fine example of a petite French woman. 'My mother Maman. She’s 91 and when I . was a boy she gave me a deep understanding of food, its purity and . nobility, and how it celebrates life,' he told MailOnline. Mr Blanc, whose Oxfordshire restaurant boasts two Michelin stars, spent Christmas with his mother after his Russian born fiancee Natalia Traxel called off their engagement late last year. It was only in October the chef said this country’s attitude to food was changing, with a growing appreciation of the importance of quality produce and that France was 'losing its strong food culture, while Britain is gaining one'. Raymond Blanc has recently split up with his Russian-born doctor fiancee Natalia Traxel (both seen right) but he has now taken to the kitchen to school singer Katherine Jenkins (left) in the art of cooking . Mr Blanc, who credits his mother as his culinary inspiration, also said she was a fine example of a petite French woman . Despite saying British women are fatter then the French, last year Raymond Blanc attacked a Great British Bake Off contestant because she was 'thin'. The chef sparked anger when he wrote on Twitter, mistakenly referring to Ruby Tandoh as the show’s winner on the night of the final. He tweeted: 'The Great British Bake Off. Not much skills, female tears and a winner so thin who makes me doubt of her love for great cooking, baking.' But Tandoh hit back, writing: '@raymond-blanc ‘female tears’?! and what has anyone’s size got to do with it? 'I don’t care if you’re a patisserie king - don’t be an idiot.' Blanc later apologised, tweeting co-host Paul Hollywood: 'Apologies if I upset people this morning. I would like to congratulate you on a show. Best Rb xx' Figures in recent years have shown that British women are now officially the most overweight in Europe. A quarter are obese – so fat it threatens their health – according to alarming figures. But it is not just British women - men are doing almost as badly, with more than one in five classed as obese. Experts are especially concerned by the young age at which so many women here are developing serious weight problems. Fifteen per cent of women in Germany are obese, while they are slimmer still in France (12.7 per cent) and Italy (9.3 per cent). Only . the U.S. and Ireland, which are not included in the Eurostat league . table, have higher obesity rates in the developed world. Neville Rigby, director of policy and public affairs at the International Obesity Forum, said the British led the field in obesity. But he added that in almost all developed countries two-thirds of adults are overweight or obese. ‘Levels of fatness are increasing all the time,’ he said. ‘They go from overweight to obesity and affect more than 60 per cent of adults in most countries'. Butter:  Catherine Collins, Principal Dietician At St George's, London would disagree with Raymond Blan's advice about cooking with butter. She says: 'Butter is rich in saturated fat and this is a major health concern. It is our high saturated-fat intake that helps make cardiovascular disease our most common cause of death, claiming 193,000 lives a year. Saturated fat increases your risk of heart disease by increasing blood cholesterol levels, particularly the 'bad' LDL cholesterol. 'Men should consume no more than 30g of saturated fat a day, and women no more than 24g to protect our heart health, and I believe we should try to stick to this. 'Two teaspoons (10g) of butter provide more than 5g of saturated fat. Swapping to a polyunsaturated or olive-oil-based spread reduces that amount to a mere 1.5g. So choosing between butter or a spread can greatly influence your saturated-fat intake.' Eating late at night:  The TV chef says snacking late at night can contribute to weight gain - and he is correct. Scientists warned last year found that eating while we stay up to browse the internet or watch a late film is likely to be contributing to rising obesity levels. The research came after tests on mice. One group were allowed to eat only during an eight-hour period, while a second group could graze on what they wanted all day and night. US researchers found that even though the two groups were eating about the same amount of calories, those who ate at set times during the day did not become obese. They suggest that those who ate when they wanted to gained weight because they disrupted their body clock – and they believe the same principle may apply to humans. Drinking alcohol: Raymond Blanc says drinking six glasses of wine at night can led to weight gain. Official guidelines state women should not regularly drink more than 2-3 units a day - that’s no more than a standard 175ml glass of wine (ABV 13%). The average glass of wine has 140 calories. Bacon and eggs for breakfast every day:  The Michelin-starred chef says women should not eat bacon and eggs every morning, but a high-fat breakfast of bacon and eggs may be the healthiest start to the day, a study at the University of Alabama at Birmingham study. 'The first meal you have appears to program your metabolism for the rest of the day,'said study senior author Martin Young, Ph.D., associate professor of medicine in the UAB Division of Cardiovascular Disease. This study suggests that if you ate a carbohydrate-rich breakfast it would promote carbohydrate utilization throughout the rest of the day, whereas, if you have a fat-rich breakfast, you have metabolic plasticity to transfer your energy utilization between carbohydrate and fat.'","'One glass of wine a day is better than six,' advises Michellin-starrred chef .

"The remains of a 2,000-year-old Native American village unearthed by archaeologists may be one of the most 'significant' prehistoric discoveries ever made in America. The Tequesta Indian site was first discovered back in 2005, when developers began excavation at what had been a parking lot. Since then they have uncovered eight circles of holes in the limestone bedrock where supports for huts may once have stood. Site of historical importance: Archaeologists have discovered eight large uniformly carved circle holes in limestone in downtown Miami, which are believed to be the foundation holes for Tequesta Indians dwellings dating as far back as 2,000 years . Archaeologist Robert Carr said: 'What’s unusual and unique about the site is that it’s this huge chunk of land where a major part of this ancient Tequesta village site is preserved. 'It’s one of the earliest urban town plans in eastern North America. You can actually see this extraordinary configuration of these buildings and structures.’ But the discovery of the village, situated where downtown Miami meets Biscayne Bay, has thrown a wrench into a multibillion-dollar development project by the Miami-based MDM Development Group. The ancient site sits in the heart of Miami's latest real estate boom surrounded by luxury condo towers with names like Icon and Epic. Across the street is a luxury JW Marriott Marquis hotel, where professional basketball players stay when in town to play the Miami Heat, as well as some of Miami's newest high-end restaurants, where celebrities are spotted nightly. Archaeologists believe the sit may be one of the earliest urban towns ever discovered in North America . 'Birthplace of Miami: The remains of the Royal Palm Hotel, one of the first hotels to ever be built in the area in 1897, has also been discovered on the site . MDM's plans for the site of the newly . discovered Tequesta circles include a movie theater, restaurants and a . 34-story hotel covering an entire city block, including the . archaeological site. The tower is part of the four-phase Met Miami project, which includes the already completed JW Marriott, an office building anchored by Wells Fargo and a 447-unit condo tower overlooking Biscayne Bay. But this discovery may put a stop to the plans as the city of Miami is under pressure to revisit permits issued to the developer in hopes changing the design to preserve the ancient village. Over the past nine years archaeologists have uncovered thousands of artifacts - as well as human bones - that show the Tequestas conducted trade with other parts of North America and the Caribbean. Preservationists claim there is growing support for the site to be saved and turned into an exhibit . The MDM Development Group plans to build movie theaters, restaurants, and a 34-story story on the site - but archaeological discoveries in the area may prevent it from going ahead . 'Accounts by Spanish (explorers) describe huts, a heathen, savage people. The big surprise is we're . finding a very sophisticated people living in one location for a fairly . long period of time,' Carr said. Archaeologists also found the foundation . of the Royal Palm Hotel at the site, built in 1897 by industrialist . Henry Flagler, who is widely credited with establishing Miami. Badly . damaged in the hurricane of 1926, the Royal Palm was demolished in 1930. The Tequesta tribe lived near Biscayne Bay, in the area now known as Miami, and they also occupied the Florida Keys. It is believed the Tequesta tribe arrived in the Biscayne Bay area, now known as Miami, before the beginning of the Current Era. The Tequesta situated their towns and camps at the mouths of rivers and streams, on inlets from the Atlantic Ocean to inland waters, and on barrier islands and keys. They are also believed to have occupied Florida Keys. Like the other tribes in Florida, the Tequesta were hunters and gatherers. They relied mainly on fish, shellfish, nuts, and berries for food. During the 1500s, Europeans began arriving in Florida. A map produced by the Dutch cartographer Hessel Gerritsz in 1630 labeled the Florida peninsula as 'Tegesta' after the tribe. European estimations of the population of the Tequesta varied between 800 and 10,000 but the tribe had disappeared by the time Britain took control of Florida from the Spanish in 1763. Preservationists say there is strong and . growing support for measures to save and create a major exhibit around . at least some of this new archaeological site. The . city's Historic and Environmental Preservation Board is expected to . discuss the proposed development at a meeting this week, and a vote . could be held later this month. 'It’s extremely important. If they gave it a name, it’s the birthplace of Miami,' said city preservation board member Gerald Marston. The developers have proposed carving out a slab of the limestone holding one or two of the larger circles on the site and displaying it once the building is complete. The Historic and Environmental Preservation Board could recommend that the city take back the property. In a statement, the developer said that would be a mistake. 'The cost to us of a full or partial taking of this property is far greater than the public would ever be willing to spend,' MDM said. 'Imposing such a staggering burden on a single company is neither lawful nor acceptable,' it added. A similar circle of holes drilled into . the rock, called the Miami Circle, was uncovered nearby in 1998 and is . thought to have once been a ceremonial Tequesta meeting place for the . native American tribe. That discovery led to a developer being forced to . sell the land back to the city. The site is now a city park. Miami's Historic and Environmental Preservation Board could hold a vote on the future of the site later this month .","Ancient Tequesta Indian village is believed to be at least 2,000-years-old .

"The Speaker of the Commons John Bercow is to be a prosecution witness during the sex trial of his former deputy, Nigel Evans. The Mail can reveal that Mr Bercow is on a list of at least ten MPs who will be called to give evidence for the Crown when Evans stands trial next month, accused of nine sex attacks on seven men. Among the other high-profile politicians who has been asked to testify during the prosecution is the Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin – a former Government Chief Whip. Speaker of the House of Commons John Bercow (left) will give evidence at the trial of former Deputy Speaker Nigel Evans (right) who faces nine charges against seven men, including one of rape . Outspoken Tory backbench MP Sarah Wollaston has also been asked to be a prosecution witness. Downing Street officials are expected to follow events at the trial very closely with the appearance of Mr Bercow, whose wife Sally is no stranger to publicity, certain to hit the headlines. According to Whitehall sources, Mr Bercow has been asked to give evidence in person at Preston Crown Court, rather than by video link, for what promises to be an extraordinary courtroom spectacle. A day after Evans was first charged with a series of sex attacks, Mr Bercow told MPs he was ‘warmly grateful’ to the politician for his three years’ service as a deputy, adding he had been ‘highly competent, fair and good-humoured’. Evans, the former deputy speaker of the House of Commons, denies all the offences he is accused of. The 56-year-old openly gay politician, formerly the Conservative MP for the Ribble Valley, Lancashire, and now serving as an independent, faces nine charges including one of rape. He entered formal not guilty pleas to all the charges during a 17-minute pre-trial hearing at Preston Crown Court last month and is due to go on trial at the same court complex on March 10. He stood in the glass-panelled dock, hands clasped in front of him, as the indictment was read to him. After hearing each of them, he said: 'Not guilty'. Tory MP Sarah Wollaston and Patrick McLoughlin - the Transport Secretary - will also give evidence . Evans had previously faced eight charges. But at the hearing last month, an additional charge was added to the indictment. Mark Heywood, QC, prosecuting, explained that the additional count had been introduced 'because some of the alleged sexual activity is said to taken place before the alleged rape and some after the alleged rape'. Evans, who was granted a continuation of his bail, denies two counts of indecent assault, six of sexual assault and one of rape. The rape and two of the sexual assaults relate to a single complainant. All the charges cover the period from 2002 to April 1 last year. The politician, of Pendleton, near Clitheroe, Lancs, resigned as deputy speaker after being charged on September 10. He quoted Winston Churchill during an extraordinary Commons speech several hours later. In a carefully-phrased personal statement, which lasted several minutes, the former Vice chairman of the . Conservative Party explained why he had stepped down as a deputy Commons speaker in the wake of the charges brought against him. The parliamentarians make up three names on a list of at least ten MPs who will be asked to speak during the trial at Preston Crown Court (pictured) which starts next month . He said: 'Winston Churchill said when you are going through hell, keep going. Sage advice. And so I will see this through to the end with the support of the people that mean so much to me.' The MP said his decision to step aside as a Deputy Speaker in the wake of the charges had been the 'most painful thing I have endured in my life'. He also revealed he had resigned the Tory whip and will stand as an independent MP for his Ribble Valley constituency in Lancashire until after ‘the conclusion of events’. Evans was one of three deputy speakers elected in a secret ballot of MPs in 2010. Later that year he came out as gay, saying he was ‘tired of living a lie’. He said that since he was first arrested over the sex allegations in May last year, he had received ‘so many hugs, prayers and good wishes’. ‘I was told I would soon see who my real friends are and that has been true,’ he added. ‘But the truth is there have been so many of them - so thank you to my dearest loyal friends, including loyal members of my staff at Westminster and the Ribble Valley. ‘And to you, my colleagues, on all sides of the House who have spoken with me, looked after me and just shown loving attention. Party divisions disappear in times like this and they have, thank you. ‘Rose Hudson-Wilkin, the Speaker’s chaplain, and Andrew Tremlett, the canon of Westminster Abbey, have given me superb spiritual guidance which has given me the one thing everyone in this world needs, alongside air, water and food: that is hope.’ Conservative MP Nadine Dorries placed a hand on Evans’s shoulder as he sat down after his statement to a hushed Commons.","Speaker of the House of Commons named as witness in case .

"First picture: PC Toby rowland on duty in Downing Street . The Plebgate row exploded again . yesterday when a former policeman insisted one of his   colleagues was . called a ‘f****** pleb’ by  Andrew Mitchell. Ian . Richardson, 50, was one of four officers on duty at the gates of . Downing Street when Mr Mitchell had the notorious run-in which cost him . his job as Chief Whip. The . constable retired from the Met a month later but broke his silence . yesterday to back the version of events given by PC Toby Rowland. Mr Richardson said Mr Mitchell was . ‘officious and rude’ to his colleague but added that the Police . Federation had hijacked the affair for its own ends. He . was ‘sad’ the Tory MP lost his Cabinet job over a ‘quirky incident that . should have blown over’. The former PC, who served for 30 years, . claimed that Downing Street officers were ‘betrayed’ by their Met . bosses. The latest twist in . the saga came as the first picture emerged of PC Rowland on duty in . Downing Street since the scandal broke in September 2012. It . was taken at the rear entrance last month as the  popular officer, who . was not disciplined or charged over the affair, searched a car. Mr . Mitchell was accused of abusing PC Rowland, 43, after officers refused . to let him cycle through the main gates of Downing Street and asked him . to use a side gate. In a . newspaper interview, Mr Richardson condemned the Police Federation for . whipping up the case against Mr Mitchell, whom he felt was treated ‘like . tethered prey’ as he was forced to resign. He . also said the officers at the gate were undermined by colleagues in the . Diplomatic Protection Group, who leaked the log of the incident, and by . PC Keith Wallis. He was jailed last week for 12 months for lying about . witnessing the incident. A police officer who witnessed the notorious Plebgate affair in Downing Street has accused the Police Federation of hijacking the incident for its own political ends. Mr Richardson denied any of the four policemen at the gate were involved in any sort of conspiracy against Mr Mitchell. He . also accused Met chiefs of failing officers by focusing on who leaked . the story instead of clarifying the incident and investigating what . happened. The former . constable was the first person to speak to  PC Rowland after the . incident although he did not actually hear the exchange, he has given three witness statements to Operation Alice, the inquiry into the affair. Mr . Richardson said that PC Rowland immediately recounted what was . allegedly said and that he had warned Mr Mitchell that the MP could be . arrested. The senior Tory . has conceded swearing in the presence of officers but vehemently denies . using the other words attributed to him. He maintains he was stitched up . by police, whom he claims lied in logs. Giving . support to PC Rowland, Mr Richardson told The Times: ‘Not for one . second did I think “he’s making this up”. He repeated to us those exact . phrases that were to become the focus of their exchange: the swearing, . the insults and the threat that we “hadn’t heard the last of this”.’ Mr . Richardson said that when Police Federation officials began to condemn . Mr Mitchell, he pleaded with senior officers to put the record straight. But he claims he was told his views were ‘of no interest to anyone’. Mr Richardson, 50, said he believed that Mr Mitchell did call the officers 'f****** plebs', as was claimed in the police log, but did not deserve to lose his job over the affair. Friends . of Mr Mitchell rallied to his defence. Former shadow home secretary . David Davis said it was clear that Mr Richardson was unable to . substantiate PC Rowland’s account. He said: ‘The gaping hole in PC Rowland’s evidence is it’s impossible to have a 40-word conversation in six seconds.’ Another . ally said: ‘The critical point is that he admits he didn’t hear what . was said. To call this account “the truth” is completely misleading.’ Mr . Richardson’s claims will stoke up pressure on the Police Federation, . whose structure, finances and running will be debated by MPs today. This week, it emerged that whistleblower Fiona McElroy was sacked after challenging rampant spending at the organisation. The former senior Whitehall civil servant is said to have asked ‘difficult questions’. Mr Mitchell and Mr Richardson both declined to comment further yesterday. An earlier version of this article's headline has been amended to further clarify that the PC in question did not overhear Mr Mitchell's conversation.","Ian Richardson retired from the Met .

"A Manhattan judge criticized Philip Seymour Hoffman's alleged drug dealer for claiming he had a heroin addiction in court on Friday after telling the post he was sober in an interview with The New York Post days earlier. Manhattan Supreme Court Justice Edward McLaughlin presented Robert Vineberg's interview to the court room during his bail hearing and he wasn't thrilled with Vineberg's contradicting stories. 'Some of the statements made on Mr. Vineberg’s behalf are inconsistent,'said the judge. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Hopeless addict? Robert Vineberg's defense team claim the 300 bags of heroin found in his apartment were for personal use . Phillip Seymour Hoffman was discovered dead in his Greenwich Village apartment with a needle sticking out of his arm earlier this month . 'He claims he is clean, you claim he is in the throes of a decade or more long addiction,' said McLaughlin to Vineberg's defense lawyer Ed Kratt. The defense claims that the 300 glasslines of heroin found at the jazz musician's apt were for personal use and that he didn't sell any drugs to Hoffman. The New York Post reports that the judge called Vineberg's amount of drugs 'off the charts' and valued the stash at $3,000. Vineberg denied selling the 73 bags of heroin to the actor. The troubled actor was discovered dead in his Greenwich Village apt with a needle sticking out of his arm. McLaughlin's bail is set at $200,000 over $40,000 cash which is expected to be set by bail bondsman Ira Judelson. Musician Robert Vineberg was regarded by friends who attended the court on Friday as 'talented' and 'generous' Vineberg told The New York Post in his controversial jail interview that Hoffman was a 'hardcore addict' but that he himself was almost clean. 'He was using needles,' he said of the famous actor. The Jazz musician has also been linked to other celebrity users such as Amy Winehouse. Cops raided Vineberg's apartment at 302 Mott street after a confidential witness said that they'd seen Hoffman at the residence. Vineberg told the post that he 'could have helped' the actor whom he'd known for about a year. Friends of the musician who'd once toured with Wyclef Jean, came to the court to show their support. Saxophonist Duke Guillaume who knew Vineberg more than 20 years said 'It was a shock to everyone...It's not the Robert we know.'","'He claims he is clean, you claim he is .

"A pregnant teenager whose boyfriend was jailed for beating her wants his mother to adopt their unborn baby girl to stop social services taking it away. Amy Dixon, 19, has already had her son put up for adoption by her local council and she fears she won't be able to keep her new daughter either. Her partner Scott Webb, 23, is currently in prison for beating her up after they had a row about her ex-boyfriend. As the young couple are in an abusive relationship it is expected that social services in Barrow, Cumbria, will take away Amy's second child when it is born next month. Unborn baby: Amy Dixon, 19, (right) wants her boyfriend's mother Wendy Webb (left) to adopt her second child because she fears that it will be adopted . Unborn baby: Amy Dixon, 19, has decided to call her new baby daughter Trinity when she is born next month . Webb was jailed for 18 weeks by . magistrates in Furness last month after admitting assaulting his . heavily-pregnant girlfriend and being in possession of cannabis. During . their row, he accused Amy of cheating on him before dragging . her into the house as she tried to escape from him. The . court issued the young thug with a restraining order to stop him . contacting her - but despite the order they have vowed to . continue with their relationship. Amy, who suffered cuts to her arms during the attack, wants Webb to tackle his anger management problems, the court was told. She has asked for her partner's mother, Wendy Webb, 43, to be given permission to look after her two-year-old son and unborn daughter who will be called Trinity. The young woman said she is prepared for the courts to issue an injunction blocking her from seeing either of the youngsters. She said she would rather the children were brought up by a blood relative than adopted by strangers. However, social services at Cumbria County Council have ruled out her proposal. Grandmother-of-two Miss Webb said she is fighting for custody of her two-year-old grandson and also wants to look after her unborn granddaughter. Her grandson is set to be adopted, but Miss Webb said she cannot appeal because she cannot afford the £5,000 legal fees. She claimed that she has been 'treated unfairly' because her son is a criminal.

'My grandson was taken into care because of the arguing between Amy and my son. We did ask for help when I went on holiday and I knew Amy was depressed but nothing was done. 'We had just returned when Amy rang me up totally distraught saying that social services were taking him. 'That was July 1 last year and he was put into foster care. From February 21 he will be able to be adopted if a family becomes available. I want to keep on fighting this but I just don't have the money. I am willing to move to Scotland to protect my grandchildren and I can't understand why they won't let me. 'If it's too late for my grandson I want to fight for my granddaughter.

'We would rather she was placed with me and we can then work at keeping the family unit together if that's what it takes, or I can bring her up. 'Amy knows she has to distance herself from my son. He was her first love and it will be hard but she has to do it for the children. 'If I have my grandchildren here both of them have said they will stay away and are willing to have injunctions put on them. If they came near the house I would call the police. The only contact they would have would be through a contact centre.' The family say social services intervened because of concerns the couple's abusive relationship was having an adverse effect on the child. They plan to attend counselling when Miss Dixon's partner is released from jail. However, as they will remain a couple it is likely their latest couple will be taken into care as well. Miss Dixon said: 'I think it's all wrong. If I can't have my children I want Wendy to bring them up. It's heartbreaking losing your children but if they go to Wendy they will be staying with family.' A Cumbria County Council spokesman said they were unable to discuss the case. 'With safety of children being paramount, the adoption process involves a range of procedures and guidelines that have to be followed to deliver the best outcome for the child,' he said.

"A trade ban on lacy lingerie has left Russian consumers and their neighbours with their knickers in a twist. The ban will outlaw any underwear containing less than six per cent cotton from being imported, made, or sold in Russia, Belarus and Kazakhstan. And it has struck a chord in societies where La Perla and Victoria's Secret are panty paradises compared to Soviet-era cotton underwear, which was often about as flattering and shapely as drapery. Anger: Women during a protest against the ban of lace underwear  in Almaty, Kazakhstan . On Sunday, 30 women protesters in . Kazakhstan were arrested and thrown into police vans while wearing lace . underwear on their heads and shouting 'Freedom to panties!' The ban in those three countries was first outlined in 2010 by the Eurasian Economic Commission, which regulates the customs union, and it won't go into effect until July 1. But a consumer outcry against it already is reaching a fever pitch. Photographs comparing sexy modern underwear to outdated, Soviet goods began spreading on Facebook and Twitter on Sunday, as women and men alike railed against the prospective changes. 'As a rule, lacy underwear ... is literally snatched off the shelves,' said Alisa Sapardiyeva, the manager of a lingerie store in Moscow, DD-Shop, as she flicked through her colorful wares. 'If you take that away again, the buyer is going to be the one who suffers the most.' The Russians' love of sexy lingerie was clearly demonstrated by members of the country's Olympic team, who posed for photographs in skimpy underwear. According to the Russian Textile Businesses Union, more than $4 billion worth of underwear is sold in Russia annually, and 80 per cent of the goods sold are foreign made. Analysts have estimated that 90 per cent of products would disappear from shelves, if the ban goes into effect this summer as planned. In the blood: Freestyle skier Ekaterina Stolyarova, 25, from Tomsk in . Siberia, comes from a family famous in the sport. Her father Andrey . Stolyarov is a merited freestyle coach, and her mother Marina a coach . and international referee . Curling hearts: Ekaterina Galkina, 25, from Moscow, was European champion in 2006 and Russia champion in 2005-2006 . Racy: Lace underwear inside a shop in Moscow, Russia . The Eurasian Economic Commission declined to comment Monday, saying it was preparing to issue a statement about the underwear ban. While consumer outrage may force customs union officials to compromise, many see the underwear ban as yet another example of the misguided economic policies that have become a trademark of many post-Soviet countries. Sunday's panty protest in Kazakhstan followed a larger demonstration the day before against a 19 per cent devaluation of the country's currency, the tenge. Other people laughed off the panty ban, seeing it as yet another attempt to add regulations and controls to an already byzantine bureaucracy in the three countries. 'I think (the girls)... will still have the opportunity to wear it (synthetic underwear) whether you can buy it in Russia or not,' said 22-year-old Muscovite Trifon Gadzhikasimov, noting that most of his friends travel abroad regularly. 'I think this is just another silly law that shows the ineffectiveness of our government.'

But as property prices rise across the country, a buyer has snapped up a tiny home which has its only toilet outside for nearly double the guide price. Graham Porter, 53, spent £15,000 on the one-up, one-down terraced home in the Welsh valleys - and is now planning to spend another £20,000 doing it up. Potential? Graham Porter, 53, bought this one-up, one-down terraced property in south Wales for £15,000. Although there is no indoor toilet, there is a satellite dish . The 100-year-old cottage, in the former mining town of Brynmawr, near Newport, was advertised as Britain’s cheapest property. With the average home in London now costing in the region of £400,000, Mr Porter bought the home for the price of a small car. He renovates properties and said he believes he has got a bargain - even though he will have to spend more than a penny knocking down the outhouse and installing an indoor bathroom. 'It may be run down but I’m going to turn it into a little gem. I will have to invest up to £20,000 doing the place up and bringing the toilet inside,' he said. Room with a phew! The outdoor toilet which is the only bathroom the  in the property in the former mining town of Brynmawr, near Newport . Doer-upper: Mr Porter said he plans to spend around £20,000 renovating the terraced home which he described as a 'bargain' Rundown: The property was dubbed the cheapest in Britain when it went up for auction with a guide price of £8,000 - however it sold for almost double . 'Then it will be a perfect, nice little home.' Graham and his wife Lena, from Stratford-Upon-Avon, have bought other run down houses to do them up but they think their latest buy is the best bargain yet. Auctioneer Paul Fosh said: 'Even at a smidge over £15,000 you are talking about buying a house for the price of small car. 'And when you compare it to property prices in London and the rest of the country - this is where the value is.' Rustic charm: The old and steep staircase in the property (left) with the view through to the utility area (right) The property last changed hands for £16,500 last August, but it was put back on the market. Across the country average house prices have surged by £14,000, or 8.8 per cent in a single year, rising at their fastest pace since 2010 the latest house price index has revealed. The Nationwide announced this week that house prices have been rising for 13 consecutive months, the longest unbroken run of monthly increase since the financial crisis began in 2007. Last year we featured a two-bed home in Burnley, Lancashire that went under the hammer for just £1,000. That property was so delapidated that it would have taken thousands of pounds to make it liveable, and it is not believed to have sold. Many parts of the country are currently experiencing a housing boom, but in some areas it is possible to purchase a home for less than the cost of a small car .

"A man who urinated on a war memorial honouring 700 servicemen who died in action has been fined just £100. David Skinner, 47, was photographed relieving himself against the structure in Margate, Kent, which honours soldiers killed in the First and Second World Wars. Skinner was fined £100 and ordered to pay a £20 victim surcharge when he appeared before Medway magistrates' court yesterday. Caught in the act: David Skinner, 47, was photographed urinating on the war memorial in Margate, Kent . He admitted outraging the public decency on Tuesday last week when he appeared before the panel. One of the names inscribed into the part of the memorial that the man urinated on is Marine Engineering Mechanic Alistair R. Leighton who died aged 19 during the Falklands war when HMS Ardent sank in 1982 after being bombed by the Argentinians' A-4 Skyhawk aircraft. A number of civilians who died in the local area during World War II are also named on the memorial. The court case happened as the country prepares to mark 100 years since the start of World War I later this year. Pamela Pople, chair of the Margate Civic Society said: 'We are quite appalled really - it’s just lack of respect. People laid down their lives and served their country – we are disappointed and disgusted.' ‘I think the public opinion would be very strong on this and people would be equally appalled. I was sent this photo, but I haven’t yet heard about the identity of this person. A Royal British Legion spokesman said: 'The Legion is saddened to hear of this senseless incident. War memorial: Skinner, 47, urinated on this section of war memorial in Margate, Kent, in February . Honoured: The war memorial in Trinity Square in Margate, Kent, which David Skinner urinated on . 'War memorials and graves honour the . memory of the British Armed Forces who have made the ultimate sacrifice . and those who defend the freedom we enjoy.' Colonel Tim Collins, a former officer from the Royal Irish Regiment, said: 'The value and respect for our nation's servicemen has diminished. Unfortunately you can't legislate for idiots.' Student Philip Laing, 19, avoided a jail sentence in 2009 after urinating on a war memorial during a mass student bar crawl. District Judge Anthony Browne, sitting at Sheffield Magistrates' Court sentenced him to 250 hours' community service. Daniel . Orrell, 24, was given a £250 fine in Bolton, Lancashire, and sold . poppies to show his remorese after being caught committing the same . offence. And Wendy Lewis, 32, from Blackpool, who urinated on the centopath was given a 15-week suspended jail sentence. Victim: Marine Engineering Mechanic Alistair Leighton is remembered on the memorial.

"She was rock star Michael Hutchence's first love, and in some ways his last. For seven years, they made a striking pair with their good looks, enigmatic brown eyes and flowing dark hair, and even after their split Hutchence and Michele Bennett remained his closest confidante as he went on to date some of the world's most beautiful and successful women. It was Bennett who the tragic INXS frontman called in a final, desperate plea for help from his best friend before his tragic demise in a Sydney hotel room. Scroll down for video . First love: Michael Hutchence and Michele Bennett (pictured on Valentine's Day 1985), who was his first serious girlfriend, became his closest confidante and the one he called with a final plea for help on the morning of his tragic death in a Sydney hotel room . Friends to the end: Michele Bennett (left) went on to become a successfuil film producer, but was always there for Michael Hutchence until his untimely death. She was played by Jane Harber (right) in the Australian telemovie INXS: Never Tear Us Apart which aired earlier this month . She rushed to her old boyfriend's aid after his last dark hours in which he struggled with his 'demons' and the fact he would not be seeing his only child, daughter Tiger Lily, for Christmas. But she was too late. She could not get inside the hotel room door, from which Hutchence was hanging from the door handle on the other side by a belt, already dead. The dramatic circumstances of the morning of November 22, 1997, when Bennett frantically knocked on the singer's door at the Ritx Carlton Hotel and called out repeatedly, but in vain, were later tendered in evidence to the coroner's inquest into his death. Now an internationally renowned feature film and music video producer, Michele Bennett is beautiful, successful and now has children of her own. But it is her life with Hutchence which has come under the spotlight, following her portrayal by actress Jane Harber in the two-part telemovie, INXS: Never Tear Us Apart. Harber described Bennett as 'a bit of a touchstone' in Michael Hutchence's life. 'Michele was Michael’s first love and somebody who played in his life for the next 20 years and was the last person he called before he passed away. 'They met at a gig  . . . kind of before he found his groove. 'He was just starting out and she obviously loved his music having been to a couple of his gigs. They fell in love quickly, as you do when you’re a teenager.' Michael's women: Hutchence had a series of high-profile girlfriends including pop idol Kylie Minogue (left) and the model Helena Christenson (right), whose exotic looks mirrored those of Ms Bennett . The relationship began around the time INXS had released its self-titled debut album. Bennett had embarked on a career as a producer, first of music videos. She produced the documentary Lovetown for the Irish band, U2, and in 1991 formed her own production company, Cherub Pictures. After meeting Hutchence, she made the INXS television documentary, Welcome to Wherever you Are, and went on to produce for Prince, Silverchair, Foofighters and other Australian and overseas artists. Bennett and Hutchence lasted as a couple until the late 1980s, by which time Hutchence had starred in the film, Dogs in Space, and the band had launched Kick, which won them international fame and success. Yates gave birth to Huthence's only child, Heavenly Hiraani Tiger Lily in July 1996. The rock star was biding his time between the UK, Hong Kong and Australia. The following January, Bennett arranged a birthday party for Hutchence in Sydney. Torn apart: a custody battle over the three older daughters she had with Irish rock legend Bob Geldof prevented Paula Yates (pictured above holding youngest daughter, Tiger Lily, with Michael Hutchence) from copming to Austrlia for Christmas 1997, and may have triggered the suicide of Michael Hutchence in a Sydney hotel room . On the night of his death, Hutchence was in Sydney preparing for a concert tour to mark INXS's 20th anniversary, and was hoping for Yates and Tiger Lily to join him for Christmas. The agreement was contingent on whether Yates could bring to Australia her three daughters with Geldof. He was exhausted by press coverage of his and Yates' relationship and the custody battle ensuing between her and Geldof over their daughters and the proposed Australian trip. Following concert rehearsals with INXS band members on Friday, November, 21, he dined with his father, Kell, and then returned to the Ritz Carlton and continued drinking. Australian actress, Kym Wilson, with whom he had once enjoyed a brief fling and her boyfriend paid him a visit, then he was on his own.  Hutchence apparently engaged in a bitter conversation with Geldof on the phone, after he had spoken with Yates who informed him told him the custody case had been adjourned, so she would not be coming to Australia with the children. At around 9.35 on the Saturday morning, he left a phone message for Michele Bennett, in which she would later say he sounded 'drunk'. At 9.54 he rang Bennett again. This time she answered. He cried down the phone, and she told him she would come straight away. The moment they met: Georgina Haig plays Paula Yates and Luke Arnold is Hutchence, pictured recreating the moment the pair met on British TV personality Yates' show, The Big Breakfast . But when Bennett finally knocked on the door, there was no answer. She tried ringing him, to no avail. Asssuming he was alright, and may simply have gone to sleep, she letf a note with reception and returned home. On November 27, 1997, Michael Hutchence's coffin was carried out of St Andrew's Cathedral by his band members and his younger brother Rhett,, as Never Tear Us Apart played in the background. Bennett told the MailOnline she never spoke about Hutchence. 'I don't like to talk about my relationship with Michael,' she said. Cherub Films, which produced the 2000 box office success, Chopper, a feature film about Melbourne criminal Chopper Read, last year made the surfing feature, Drift. The company's latest film is Mule, about a first time drug importer. Bennett also made the 2004 music documentary, Leonard Cohen: I'm Your Man.","Michele Bennett was tragic Michael Hutchence's first love .

"The father of the child who was ripped from her murdered mother’s womb and then kidnapped has today broken his five-year his silence after the killer was convicted of the grisly crime that shocked a nation. Speaking exclusively to MailOnline, Roberto Rodriguez, 29, whose estranged partner, Darlene Haynes was eight months pregnant when she was horrifically murdered, revealed that he hasn't told the four-year-old about her mother and fears she might blame herself. Mr Rodriguez said: ‘My daughter doesn’t know what happened to her mother. She’s too young to understand right now. If I told her how she had been . born what would she think? Scroll down for video . Terrible truth: Rodriguez told MailOnline: 'My daughter doesn’t know what happened to her mother. She’s too young to understand right now. If I told her how she had been . born what would she think?' Killer: Julie Corey, 39, pictured today, was sentenced to life for the brutal murder of her friend Darlene, then 23, whose body was found on 27 July 2009 stashed in a small closet of the Worcester, Massachusetts home the friends had shared . ‘She might blame herself. She might think that it was her fault her mother died.’ Rodriguez, who was accused of assaulting Darlene in the weeks before the murder went on to defend himself after he was accused in court of taking part in the gruesome crime and was questioned twice by detectives. He said: ‘We’ve waited five years for this, five years for justice. I’ve . had my name dragged through the mud. 'I’ll always be known as some . scumbag but I don’t care now, I don’t care about my name I’m just happy . this is over and that the person who did this has got what they . deserve.' Julie Corey, 39, was convicted of the brutal murder of her friend Darlene, then 23, whose body was found on 27 July 2009 stashed in a small closet of the Worcester, Massachusetts home the friends had shared. She was sentenced to life in prison today while Haynes's father sat in court holding his daughter's ashes and her other daughter, now aged nine, read a heartbreaking statement to the court. Haynes had been beaten around the head and strangled with an electric cord from a lamp. Corey, who had herself miscarried three months earlier, then cut the unborn child from her friend’s womb. Grisly: Haynes (pictured with another of her children) was beaten around the head . and strangled with an electric cord. Corey, who had herself . miscarried 3 months earlier, then cut the fetus from her . friend’s womb . Quiz: Rodriguez was questioned by police and treated as a suspect at first in the case because of his troubled relationship with Darlene Haynes . Fred Haynes, father of Darlene, breaks down during the sentencing of Corey in Worcester, Mass., Superior Court today . District Attorney Joseph Early Jr described the case as ‘the most horrific case this office has ever seen in terms of facts.’ Haynes, he said, was ‘killed for her baby.’ Corey tried to pass the child off as her own, to her boyfriend Alex Dion, 31. The couple were found following a tip off two days after Haynes's body was found, 130 miles away in a homeless shelter in Plymouth, New Hampshire. Mr Rodriguez was granted full custody of the child who now lives with him and his wife Ana. He married Ana Cruz on 17 August 2009 having applied for the marriage license at Worcester City Hall on the very day that Haynes’s mutilated body was discovered after neighbors complained to their landlord about the smell. Haynes knew both Corey and Dion through her relationship with Rodriguez. In closing arguments defense attorney Louis Aloise offered a theory that Haynes was actually killed by Rodriguez who then removed the 4lb infant from her mother’s womb and gave her to Corey. Speaking of Rodriguez Mr Aloise alleged: ‘He had had it with Darlene Haynes.’ Mr Rodriguez was questioned twice by detectives investigating the case in 2009. Sick: Corey tried to pass the child off as her . own, to her boyfriend Alex Dion, 31 (all three pictured above). The couple were found following a . tip off two days after Haynes's body was found, 130 miles away . ‘I don’t owe it to nobody to try to clear my name in public. It doesn’t bother me what people think. ‘I . have a lovely family and I’m just trying to raise my daughter the best I . can. She’s affected by what happened – she is not the same as other . four-year-olds.’ Mr Rodriguez declined to elaborate on the extent of the physical legacy of his daughter’s violent birth. The prosecutor described that violence as an act of  ‘extreme atrocity and cruelty.’ As . far as shocked neighbors who had known both women were concerned there . had been no reason to suspect that Corey and Haynes were anything other . than two good friends sharing the excitement of the imminent births of . their children. Corey told friends she was expecting a daughter too and that she planned to call her Ailda. On . the day of the murder Corey told friends she was giving Haynes a ride . to a local store. She then called her boyfriend Dion and told him her . waters had broken and that she had gone into labor. The . next morning she presented the premature infant as her own. But the . umbilical cord raised the suspicion of several witnesses as it had . clearly not been cut by a doctor and was tied with a bow. When . the full horror of the crime emerged with the discovery of Haynes’s . body, police immediately focused on her estranged boyfriend, Mr . Rodriguez as a prime suspect. Suspicions: Corey presented the premature infant as her own they day after the birth. But the . umbilical cord raised the suspicion of several witnesses as it had . clearly not been cut by a doctor and was tied with a bow . The couple’s relationship had been marred by violence and difficulty. Hayne’s own family history was fractured and troubled. Her mother left her in the care of her grandmother, Joanne, when she was just six years old. Speaking to MailOnline this week Joanne admitted that she had never met Mr Rodriguez. She said that in latter years, the granddaughter she has raised as her own had ‘come and gone’ from their lives, sometimes disappearing for months on end. She said she had seen her great-grandchild – whom Haynes told friends she planned to name Sheila – only once when she was brought round by an official from the Department of Children and Families. In the weeks before her murder, Haynes had reported Mr Rodriguez to police for an assault. She told social worker Jessica Bader, who had had various dealings with Haynes, that Mr Rodriguez had thrown his heavily pregnant girlfriend into a glass table and ripped the phone from the wall to prevent her from calling for help. Death scene: The apartment building at 95 Southgate St in Worcester, MA where Darlene was killed. She shared it with Corey, who had suffered a miscarriage some months earlier . Caught: Corey is led away days after her friend's body was discovered on July 29, 2009 and her plot revealed . Mr Rodriguez said: ‘I know what some people think of me. But I don’t care anymore and I don’t have to defend myself. ‘The killer has got what they deserve this is justice. Some people need their 15 minutes of fame. I don’t need that. I don’t want it.’ ‘I want my family to be respected and for us to start a fresh chapter in our lives. I want this verdict to be the beginning of that. ‘My daughter didn’t ask for this but she’ll have to live with it. We will tell her in time. ‘But right now I’m done with this. I’m just done. We want to move on that people let us do that.’ Meanwhile, in an emotional hearing in court today, the judge read a statement from Haynes's nine-year-old daughter. It read: 'Julie, it was mean to kill my mother. I think it was very bad that you did that.'","Roberto Rodriguez, 29, has kept silent on horror death of Darlene Haynes for five years .

"A pensioner whose wife died from cancer after he booked £1,200 flights for them to go on holiday was refused a refund by EasyJet - until they performed a 'U-turn'.

"Fascinating images have emerged showing the intricate tunnels through which the world's Most Wanted Drug Lord Joaquin 'El Chapo' Guzman escaped last week only to be nabbed days later at a beachside resort. As Mexican marines forced their way into his main hideout in Culiacan just days ago, Guzman, whose nickname means 'Shorty,' slipped out of the home through a secret door beneath a bathtub. He then climbed down a corrugated steel ladder into a network of tunnels and sewer canals that connect to at least seven other houses in Culiacan, officials said. Scroll down for video . Elaborate tunnels: Guzman escaped firstly through an open steel reinforced door leading to a series of interconnected tunnels in the city's drainage system in the city of Culiacan. The above picture shows one of about seven of these doors . Caught: Just days after infamous Guzman escaped through the tunnels, pictured, linking his Culiacan homes, he was finally accosted at a beach side condo . Got him: Joaquin 'El Chapo' Guzman, pictured, was arrested Saturday but days earlier he evaded authorities by escaping through the tunnels . The photographs show the houses that . appear unremarkable from the outside, but at each residence, the Mexican . military found the same thing: steel reinforced doors and an escape . hatch below the bathtubs. Each of the trapdoors led to a series of dank, smelly interconnected tunnels in the city's drainage system. An Associated Press reporter who walked through one of the tunnels had to dismount into a canal and stoop to enter the drain pipe, which was filled with water and mud and smelled of sewage. About 2300 feet in, a trap door was open, revealing a newly constructed tunnel. Large and lined with wood panels like a cabin, the passage had lighting and air conditioning. At the end of the tunnel was a blue ladder attached to the wall that led to another of the houses Mexican authorities say Guzman used as a hideout. Working on the information gleaned . through wiretaps and from Guzman's bodyguards who were arrested in a . series of raids from February 13, marines swarmed the house of Guzman's . ex-wife. But they struggled to batter down the steel-reinforced door, which gave the cartel boss the time he needed to flee. Once law enforcement were inside, it was too late. Guzman was gone. However, U.S. intelligence was good. Officials knew that he had been spending time at the beachside resort of . Mazatlan, and they even knew where he liked to stay while there. Way out: The drug lord went to great lengths to ensure he could escape, and the tunnels worked - at first . Intricate: The tunnels in the city's drainage system link seven homes, including this one . Back door: Officials arrested one of Guzman's top aides a day after he fled and the aide told investigators that he picked up Guzman from a drainage pipe and helped him flee. This photo shows another home linked by tunnels . As he traveled south to Mazatlan, leaving behind grenades, rifles, ballistic vests and armored cars, because he didn't have time to bring them, hot on his heels was a team of U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration agents. The DEA officers set up a base of operations with Mexican marines in the city, according to a U.S. law-enforcement officials. Early on Saturday morning, Guzman's . reign came to an end without a shot fired. Marines closed the beachside . road in front of the Miramar condominiums, a 10-story, pearl-colored . building with white balconies overlooking the Pacific and a small pool . in front. Wouldn't know: At each residence, including that pictured, the Mexican military found the same thing: steel reinforced doors and an escape hatch below the bathtubs. Each of the trapdoors led to a series of dank, smelly interconnected tunnels in the city's drainage system . Drug lord: Joaquin 'El Chapa' Guzman is led into a military helicopter following his arrest early Saturday morning . Raid: He was finally arrested during a raid Saturday at his condo, pictured, in Mazatlan, with his young wife . Smashing down the door of the condo, they seized the country's most-wanted man at 6:40 a.m. without a shot being fired from either side. 'He didn't put up any resistance,' Mike Vigil, a retired senior DEA official briefed on the arrest told The Washington Post. 'He was physically tired from the stress of being hunted.' The 56-year-old was marched outside in front of scores of hungry media and taken by helicopter to a maximum-security prison in Almoloya de Juarez, outside Mexico City. It's unclear yet whether he will be tried in the U.S. or Mexico.","As Mexican marines forced their way into his main hideout in Culiacan just days ago, Guzman slipped out of through a secret door beneath a bathtub .

"TV regulator Ofcom has said it will investigate Channel 4 series Benefits Street to see whether it broke broadcasting guidelines following nearly 1,800 complaints. The documentary series sparked hundreds of complaints after featuring a thief showing how to shoplift. Other residents were revealed to be benefit cheats while a 15-year-old child bride was also featured on the show filmed in James Turner Street, Birmingham. Ofcom will examine whether the programme may have caused offence by being misleading or unfair, and whether enough was done to protect under-18s in the show, as well as the way it depicted possible crimes. Complaints: The five-part series Benefits Street attracted around 1,800 complaints to Ofcom - but was a huge ratings success for Channel 4 . Shoplifting: Danny Smith was filmed explaining how to dodge shop security and take the tags off clothes without damaging them during the first episode of Benefits Street . Benefit fraud: Mark and Becky, who live on James Turner Street, told programme makers they had their benefits stopped because of fraud . Child bride: Romanian husband Stefan Stana was filmed in episode two admitting he had married his wife, thought to be called Madalina Balasa, when she was 15 . The documentary series was supposed to portray the daily lives of people living in the road - many of whom are living off handouts. The watchdog was deluged with calls, letters and emails from viewers of the five-part documentary series. However, Ofcom said they would not look into the complaints until the end of the run, which finished last week. In the first episode, prolific shoplifter Danny Smith was shown explaining how to dodge security alarms and remove security tags from designer clothes without causing damage. Young couple Mark and Becky who live on the street told the film-makers they had all their benefits stopped because of fraudulent claims.

Only a few months later,  the . teenager, thought to be called Madalina Balasa,  gave birth to a baby . girl in a Birmingham hospital. The series generated around 960 complaints to Ofcom and another 800 to Channel 4. Benefits Street is the channel’s biggest ratings hit since its coverage of the Paralympics in 2012. Channel 4 and programme makers Love Productions claim the street is typical of hundreds of UK communities struggling to cope with economic and social decline. But some critics labelled it ‘poverty porn’ and said it is paints a false picture of life in modern Britain. Others praised it for exposing the truth of benefits fraud but said it failed to condemn crime and also exploits children, exposing them to bullying and victimisations. Some residents said the show - which shows children swearing and misbehaving - has left youngsters to ashamed and embarrassed to go to school. An Ofcom spokeswoman said: 'Following the conclusion of Benefits Street, Ofcom can confirm that it has launched an investigation into the series.' A spokesman for Channel 4 said: 'We are confident there has been no breach of the Ofcom code and will be providing a detailed and robust response to the investigation.'","Shoplifter explained how to remove security tags from stolen clothes .

Emotional: Kate and Gerry McCann give a press conference about their daughter following her disappearance . Scene: Madeleine went missing from the Ocean Club (pictured) as her parents dined at a nearby restaurant . He added that further letters of request would be sent to Portugal on a 'routine' basis as the probe gathers pace. Meanwhile, Detective Chief Inspector Andy Redwood, who is leading the hunt for Madeleine, has travelled to Portugal this week to meet senior officers in the Algarve. Last month, three prime suspects in Madeleine's disappearance were identified by Scotland Yard officers. Analysis of mobile phone data suggested a burglary gang was operating very near to where she vanished in Portugal in May 2007. Meeting: Detective Chief Inspector Andy Redwood (pictured), who is leading the hunt for Madeleine, has travelled to Portugal this week to meet senior officers in the Algarve . The three men made an unusually high number of calls to each other in the hours after Madeleine was reported missing from her holiday flat. Police are believed to be closing in on the thieves, including at least one Portuguese man, who had already carried out one raid in the resort of Praia da Luz, according to the Daily Express. However, the Met Police has refused to comment on the reports  - with Mr Hewitt claiming no requests for interviews or arrests have been made so far. Madeleine, who was then nearly four, disappeared from her family's holiday apartment in Praia da Luz in the Algarve on May 3, 2007, as her parents dined at a nearby restaurant with friends. British detectives launched a fresh investigation into the youngster's disappearance in July last year - two years into a review of the case - and made renewed appeals on television in the UK, the Netherlands and Germany. After shelving their inquiry into Madeleine's disappearance in 2008, Portuguese authorities said last October that a review had uncovered enough new information to justify reopening it. Today, Scotland Yard stressed that the third international letter of request is a routine part of the inquiry - and would not reveal what it said. Letters of request are typically used to ask the Portuguese police to carry out certain pieces of work on the British force's behalf. A spokesman for Madeleine's parents, Kate and Gerry McCann, told the newspaper that the latest request for help was 'a significant development' in the case.","Deputy Assistant .

"A highly-sexualised music video of an 11-year-old girl dancing in skimpy clothing and taking part in a mock execution has provoked a furious response from parents with some campaigners calling for the music director to be 'banned from working with children.' The video, which has been released on YouTube, features the American singer and actress Alison Gold whose parents are funding her already controversial music career. Titled Shush Up, the clip appears to . cover every topic which is inappropriate for a pre-pubescent girl including . underage sexuality, crime, bondage, childbirth, strip club style . dancing, sexy nurses, police arrest, incarceration and death by . execution. A highly-sexualised music video of an 11-year-old girl dancing in skimpy clothing and taking part in a mock execution has been branded the 'the creepiest video of all time' The video, which has been released on YouTube, features the American singer and actress Alison Gold whose parents are funding her music career . The music video, which was posted online this week, sees Gold leap about in a series of shiny two piece outfits, wearing heavy make-up and batting outsized eyelashes. It was produced by Patrice Wilson, CEO of Ark Music, who also put together the notorious viral hit Friday, by teen singer Rebecca Black - she eventually left school due to bullying. Within hours of the video's release a petition was set up on change.org demanding that Mr Wilson 'stay away from little girls'. One outrage voter wrote on the petition: 'As a father of an 11 year old girl, this is absolutely disgusting,' while another said: 'This man is a disgusting exploiter of young girls.' Vivienne Pattison, director of pressure group Mediawatch-UK said: 'She is a bit of a victim here - she is not old enough to have made an informed decision. Since the video premiered, a petition has been set up on change.org demanding that Mr Wilson 'stay away from little girls'. Left Alison Gold in a normal shot and right her make-up in the controversial video . The video appears to cover every topic which is inappropriate for a pre-pubescent girl including underage sexuality, crime, bondage, childbirth, strip club style dancing, sexy nurses, police arrest, incarceration and death by execution . 'It is the same old thing that . children are being taught - their values lie in their sexuality and if . you want to have value in our society you have to look this way, behave . this way. Ms Pattinson explained that even if the video was deleted as many campaigners are calling for,  it may be too late: . 'The point is its out there and it exists in the digital sphere and that's it - it is stored somewhere for the future. 'As much as I wish they didn't exist it's very hard to get them off the internet - a digital footprint is hard to erase.' The YouTube comment section under the video has also been inundated with outraged viewers and had over a 1,000 dislikes. One user wrote: 'She's so young. This is bordering on child pornography, ' while another wrote: 'What kind of parents allow this?' The video begins with Alison Gold . apparently robbing a jewellery store, after which she is held up by . gun-toting police, handcuffed and taken off to hospital where she gives . birth to a doll-baby and is looked after by nurses who carry . outsized syringes. In between scenes, females dressed like strippers do lots of dancing in the corridor of a prison or police cell. Producer of the Alison Gold music video, Ark Music CEO Patrice Wilson, who makes a cameo as a prisoner visited by Gold, defended himself sgainst heavy criticism, saying it was 'art' Alison . goes to a club, where lots of young people, who are nevertheless at . least twice her age, are dancing and stroking each other. She is then featured in a orange prison jumpsuit sitting in an electric chair watched by weeping relatives. A prison official asks, 'Any last words?' and she replies, 'Gold is the new black'. A switch is flipped, and then she appears to lurch in death throes as the cap on the electric chair crackles and glows. But Wilson, who has a cameo in the clip, playing the orange-suited prisoner Gold visits in a police lock-up has defended the video saying it was 'art'. 'To everyone concerned about the music video — Shush Up — it’s pure art, and it’s no different than a Willow Smith video or the 10-year-old dancer, Kaycee Rice,' Wilson told website Moshnews. 'It’s no different from watching Dance Moms, dancing with their kids or Toddlers and Tiaras. This video is simply art and in my opinion, has a lot of creative elements to it.' Unsavory: Alison Gold is pictured singing in the video to the Ark Music-produced Chinese Food which has now gone viral . He said the the young singers' family had asked for an 'edgier' video than her last offering. 'It was a song I wrote in December last year while I was in Ireland. Alison and her family wanted something more different and edgier. 'We were going to do a remake of a Bobby Brown song, however we decided to go with a more powerful dance song. Then I decided to write a video story that had a powerful meaning to it. It was a fun shoot and took about one full month to film.' Not much is known about Alison Gold -  her Twitter states 'Alison Gold is an 11 year old American singer, actress and dancer. She was born on May 9, 2002 in Fairfax, VA. She got discovered by Patrice Wilson in 2012.' Last year, Alison stirred up controversy . with the video release of a song called Chinese Food,  supposedly the . young singer's ode to the joys of Oriental cuisine.","Alison Gold released the 'sexualised' pop video this week on YouTube .

"'TV star': White Dee is taking her children on holiday for the rest of the week after being signed up by an agent dubbed the 'Brummie Simon Cowell' Benefits Street 'star' White Dee has been signed up by an agent and has been inundated with bra modelling and television offers - although she is still living off handouts. The single mother-of-two says she is unable to work because she is 'depressed' - but that is not stopping her sizing up a string of lucrative offers. Her new agent Barry Tomes - dubbed the 'Brummie Simon Cowell' - said: 'She has had loads of offers and can't quite get her head round the figures involved. 'But that's TV - she's got the x-factor, innit. 'She is TV gold and we will make her a lot of money.' She is going on holiday for the rest of the week to somewhere within Britain with her two children Caitlin, 16, and Gerrard, seven, who are on their half term holiday. Despite being signed off work sick, White Dee has made two live television appearances this week and also written an article for The Spectator magazine. Tory MP Philip Davies yesterday branded the 42-year-old who lives off £200 a week in handouts 'bone idle' and said that jobless single mother has no interest in getting a job. Speaking from her council house in James Turner Street, Birmingham, White Dee - whose real name is Deirdre Kelly - said the pressure of being a celebrity has made her more 'depressed'. The unemployed mother said: 'It has been such a hectic time, it has been crazy. I have had offers from all over the world but I am still just Dee, mum to Gerrard and Caitlin. 'Someone has asked if I will be a rapper, I think that is the one I was shocked by the most. 'I . think it came from a band in London. My street cred is going through . the roof now. I will be rapping on an LP next. Don't get me wrong I rap . at home. 'Me and the little fella make up raps - so bring it on. You will be watching me and Eminem battle it out for number one. 'I guess I have got the dilemma of being an MP or a rapper now - maybe even a rapping MP. I will be getting down with the kids.' Her new agent Mr Tomes claims to have offices in Los Angeles and France - but was today seen getting into a battered old silver Ford Mondeo. Fans: Eager tourists have begun making pilgrimages to James Turner Street . Pose: Fans pose for a picture outside White Dee's home in Winson Green, Birmingham, today . Warning: White Dee has left a message on the window of her home in James Turner Street . He said the media should just refer to White Dee as 'Dee' from now on - and said she would be coming off benefits shortly. 'The first thing to do is sort her benefits out. If I can get just one person off handouts that would be great,' he said. Agent: Barry Tomes who today said that the Benefits Street star is 'TV gold and we will make her a lot of money' 'She says she can't work at the moment but she wants to. Dee is going away for a few days now with her children who are on half term - somewhere within the UK. 'Then we are going to discuss her offers with her. We have literally been inundated - every television show you can imagine wants her, there are perfume offers, clothing and bra companies. 'Universities want her to come and speak, she has had offers to do topless photo shoots and she can launch a music career.' Michelle Mone's upmarket lingerie firm Ultimo denied claims they wanted White Dee to model for them. Dee's agent Barry runs the Tomes . Media Group which has run marketing campaigns for the likes of Gotham . Records, Promobeats and Ripperstone Films. He . has been working in the music industry for nearly 40 years after he . started out in the 1970s as a Tour Manager for 1960s star Lulu. He . then went on to run his own successful music agency representing . British pop band Right Said Fred - who had a 1991 number one hit in the . US with 'I'm Too Sexy'. He also boats an impressive client list including Alvin Stardust, Slade, Tony Christie and Shakin' Stevens. White . Dee said: 'Barry is my guardian angel. He came into my life on Monday . when I was being harassed by the media, it went mental. 'He . has just given me some breathing space because I have never dealt with . it before and he is now a great friend. We speak every day. 'I guess for the future watch this space, I will just take each day as it comes.' She added that she has become such a celebrity that she is unable to walk down the street without being harassed. 'I . really have had my personal life invaded, I can't walk down the street . or walk into a supermarket without people coming up to me,' she said. Agent: White Dee - who has brought in the man dubbed the 'Brummie Simon Cowell' to be her agent - is seen getting into an old Fiat Punto with the wing mirror falling off the door . 'Television star': White Dee's agent said today 'she's got the x-factor innit' - as he boasted that she will make a lot of money . Benefits Street 'star' White Dee has signed up for her own Twitter account - after becoming sick of people impersonating her. Explaining her recent decision to set up her @therealdeekelly Twitter account, she said: 'I can just about send a text message but I have had to go on Twitter because I have got too many people pretending to be me, basically being horrible to me. 'I don't really personally care what people think of me - all I care about is that I am loved by my friends and by my family. 'Too many people are too quick to judge.' The unemployed 42-year-old, who has also been mocked on fake Facebook accounts, joked: 'Why do they want to impersonate me for God's sake - I wouldn't want to impersonate myself!' 'I really can't believe it or get to grips with it. But if someone says I can't do it, it is like a red rag to a bull I want to prove I can do it and that I am not common. 'The thing with being an MP is I am an everyday person who knows what it is like so I think that would be good. I would focus on the children of today. 'All the attention has made my depression worse though because I can't plan ahead so I let people down. I can't cope with the pressure. 'The depression started when my mum died a couple of years ago. She had been ill for quite some time but we all thought she would live for ever. 'She seemed to deteriorate quickly. I just can't really talk about it to be honest. 'I just have to take each day as it comes. I think there is enough help out there for depression and grief but it needs advertising. 'So at the moment I need to be on benefits until I feel better and have got my head around everything. Nobody wants to be on benefits but I need to be. Tweets: Now Benefits Street 'star' White Dee has set up her own Twitter account . Television appearance: White Dee has made TV appearances but says she was not paid . 'I have had offers from all over, from being a topless model, a full time agony aunt to a rapper. Obviously some are ridiculous and some are more serious. 'But my kids come before any money, it is about their future. I guess all these offers could make millions. 'I am still doing my everyday life. I will never swan off and leave my kids. 'James Turner Street is my home and my family and I will never leave it, no matter about the attention. 'Obviously some days I have bad days and I don't feel well so with all the people coming to my door I have had to put a sign up saying I am ill and to respect my wishes. Controversy: Critics have questioned whether White Dee is really unable to work. However, mental health charities have said that depression is not always obvious . 'People are good though and they respect it. 'People come to the door - just normal people wanting to meet another normal person. They want photographs with me which I can't understand. 'They want my autograph as well but I will never do that, it is ridiculous. I guess the show could be my ticket off benefits but I am not up to full time work at the moment. 'I have never classed myself as a celebrity - I am who I am and I won't be changing.' The Benefits Street single mother said she has had three marriage proposals since appearing on television. She said: 'I have had three marriage proposals since the show. I want them to take me out for dinner first though. 'I have had boyfriends but never in the house. I don't think it is fair on the kids to have a boyfriend around.'","White Dee's new agent Barry Tomes said: 'She's got the x-factor, innit'

"A woman whose ‘controlling’ ex-husband spanked her with a plimsoll as punishment for an affair says she hopes her case will help other domestic violence victims to come forward. Graham Jones, 45, admitted hitting his primary school teacher wife Sarah on the bottom as punishment after learning of the relationship. After he was sentenced to eight months, suspended for two years, yesterday she said: ‘Domestic abuse goes on in hundreds of houses. Attack: Sarah Jones, 48, who was spanked by her husband Graham, 45, (right) after he found out about her affair. A judge heard today that the couple are now divorcing . It is a very isolating and lonely thing. It is very difficult to get out of once you are in it. ‘If just one other person is able to go to the police because of this case it will be a good thing.’ Before . the assault in April last year, Jones had shown his 48-year-old wife . two pie charts and a bar chart detailing how her affair had hurt him. He took her into their cellar where he spanked her bare bottom four times with one of  their son’s gym plimsolls. He bent her over the tumble dryer – which was on to drown out the noise of her crying. She . escaped to the kitchen but he followed, saying she must have eight . spanks – one for every day he had known about the affair to ‘equal out’ his pain. He pulled her pyjamas down again and gave her four further spanks with a spatula. Axed teacher: Graham Jones was sacked as a headteacher after being caught having an affair, viewing porn on a school laptop and sending bullying e-mails to staff . When police interviewed Jones after his wife complained the following day, he claimed she had consented to being hit. He . said the couple had engaged in adventurous sexual behaviour before and . that she had texted him two days earlier suggesting she wanted to be . spanked. But he pleaded guilty to assault last month at Mold Crown Court in North Wales. Last . night, Mrs Jones said her ex-husband, a former headteacher, had ‘made . up’ that she had suggested spanking in a text. ‘It was him who suggested . it, not me.’ But . outside court, Jones claimed: ‘Only 32 hours beforehand I received a . text from her telling me she had been naughty, deserved to be punished . and she consented to spanking as she has done over the years.’ Lewis was jailed for nine years after he admitted sexual assault by penetration and physical assault on the woman at Mold Crown Court (pictured) The . couple had initially had a successful marriage, but it ran into . problems after Jones was forced to leave his job when he was caught . having an affair, viewing porn on a school laptop and sending bullying . emails to staff. He . resigned as head of Trelogan Primary School, in Flintshire, and was . later suspended from working as a teacher for four months. Jones found out about his wife’s affair when she accidentally sent him a text intended for her lover. Sentencing, . Judge Peter Hayward said he did not ignore that the spanking was the . sort of behaviour they had practised in the past. But the incident in question had occurred without her consent, he said. Jones, . from, Wrexham, was also ordered to attend a domestic violence course . and made the subject of a two-year restraining order.","Graham Jones 'wanted to punish his wife Sarah for betraying him'

"Social media giant Facebook was forced to issue an apology today after its new £10billion acquisition, WhatsApp, went down for nearly three hours. The team behind the instant messaging app, which was snapped up by Facebook on Thursday, revealed the fault was caused by 'server issues'. The popular application's chat conversations - used by more than 450 million people across the world each month - showed a loading asterisk and alert, 'Connecting...' while the problems persisted. Facebook was forced to issue an apology to the 450million global monthly users of WhatsApp after the instant messaging service suffered 'server issues' WhatsApp used its @wa-status account to tweet at 8:16pm: 'Sorry we currently experiencing server issues. We hope to be back up and recovered shortly.' At 10.48pm it announced the problems had been fixed, tweeting: 'WhatsApp service has been restored. We are so sorry for the downtime...' Some users complained about the problems, while others joked that the WhatsApp team had gone on holiday following their multi-billion dollar deal with Facebook. Olympic medal-winning diver Tom Daley asked his 2.62 million Twitter followers: 'Anyone else's WhatsApp stopped working?' Software engineer Chris Sedlmayr (@catchamonkey) tweeted: 'Anything that can ""go down"" shouldn't be relied on. Plenty of decentralised ways to message, they can't go down as such.' Mathew Ingram (@mathewi) said: 'WhatsApp undergoes some downtime, as founders are too busy counting out their Facebook billions one bill at a time.' Facebook announced on Thursday that its deal with WhatsApp comprised four billion US dollars (£2.4 billion) in cash and 12 billion US dollars (£7.18 billion) worth of Facebook shares. The agreement also provides for an additional three billion US dollars (£1.8 billion) in restricted stock units to be granted to WhatsApp's founders and employees to be paid in four years. Around 70 per cent of WhatsApp's monthly 450 million users use the application every day, Facebook said. The problems came just days after Facebook announced it had bought WhatsApp for 19 billion dollars (£9.6million) in cash and stocks . Mark Zuckerberg, founder and chief executive of Facebook, said: 'WhatsApp is on a path to connect one billion people. The services that reach that milestone are all incredibly valuable.' Jan Koum, co-founder and chief executive of WhatsApp, said: 'WhatsApp's extremely high user engagement and rapid growth are driven by the simple, powerful and instantaneous messaging capabilities we provide. 'We're excited and honoured to partner with Mark and Facebook as we continue to bring our product to more people around the world.' The WhatsApp brand is to be maintained, and its headquarters will remain in Mountain View, California. Mr Koum will join Facebook's board of directors, and WhatsApp's core messaging product and Facebook's existing Messenger app will continue to operate as stand alone applications. The new move from Facebook comes after it recently reported record revenues of 2.5 billion dollars (£1.5 billion) from 750 million daily users. The end of quarter results, published at the end of last month, showed a revenue rise of one billion dollars (£0.6bn) on the same period last year. A total of 757 million people used the world's biggest social media platform every day between October and December, up from 618 million the same time in 2012. In 2012, Facebook bought photo sharing social media site Instagram for one billion US dollars (£600 million).","Instant messaging app went offline for nearly three hours .

"A Christian ministry's long-stalled plans to build Noah's Ark in the hills of Kentucky have been revived. Creation Museum founder Ken Ham announced Thursday that a municipal bond offering has raised enough money to begin construction on the Ark Encounter project, estimated to cost about $73 million. Groundbreaking is planned for May and the ark is expected to be finished by the summer of 2016. Ham said a high-profile evolution debate he had with 'Science Guy' Bill Nye on February 4 helped boost support for the project. Creationist: Ken Ham, founder of the nonprofit ministry Answers in Genesis, poses with one of his favorite animatronic dinosaurs during a tour of the Creation Museum in Petersburg . Nye said he was 'heartbroken and sickened for the Commonwealth of Kentucky' after learning that the project would move forward. He said the ark would eventually draw more attention to the beliefs of Ham's ministry, which preaches that the Bible's creation story is a true account, and as a result, 'voters and taxpayers in Kentucky will eventually see that this is not in their best interest.' Ham's Answers in Genesis ministry and the Creation Museum enjoyed an avalanche of news media attention during the debate, which focused on science and the Bible's explanations of the origins of the universe. Answers in Genesis unveiled the proposal in 2010 for a $150 million theme park that would include the ark. But private donations to the project did not keep pace with the construction timeline, forcing its backers to delay the ark's construction and divide the park development into phases. The bonds were offered last year by the city of Williamstown, site of the planned ark about 40 miles south of Cincinnati. Message: Ken Ham's ministry pushes a literal interpretation of the Bible's creation story . Debate: Creation Museum head Ken Ham (right)  speaks during a debate on evolution with TV's 'Science Guy' Bill Nye, at the Creation Museum in Petersburg, Kentucky . Ham said the bond issue faced many . obstacles, including what he called misleading news media reports and . attempts by opponents to disrupt the bond offering. Ham . would not disclose the total amount of bond funds raised because of . underwriter restrictions. But a December bond document describing the . project listed the amount at $62 million. Mark Looy, a vice president . with Answers in Genesis, said the figure is less than $62 million, and . that the minimum funding requirement was achieved. Nye . brushed off a question about whether he might be criticized for taking . part in a debate that boosted fundraising for the ark. New exhibit: People enter and exit the new Creation Museum in Petersburg, where an ark will soon be built . 'Me? I've always been criticized,' he said. The bonds are to be repaid through revenue from the park, and the city is not liable for the money, according to bond documents. The . wooden ark would have old-world details, such as wooden pegs instead of . nails, straight-sawed timbers and plenty of animals - some alive, some . robotic. The Creation Museum . opened in 2007 and has been criticized by scientists as an affront to . evolution science. Ham said Thursday that 2 million visitors have . entered the museum since it opened.","The Creation Museum in Kentucky will begin construction of a Noah's Ark exhibit .

"Miami-Dade County prosecutors have released 10 hours of jail surveillance footage which shows Justin Bieber after his drunk driving arrest in January. In one clip, Bieber wavers as he tries to walk heel to toe, then  stumbles slightly as he turns and appears to have his arms out for balance. And at another point, the bored pop star starts doing push-ups in his cell. The new footage was released just a day after police in Atlanta seized marijuana in an SUV at his house. Scroll down for video . After the arrest: Justin Bieber is pictured in surveillance footage following his arrest last month for drunk driving . Wavering: In the few moments showing Bieber, he walks a line as part of a sobriety test, but seems unbalanced . Facing the charges: A court date for the DUI case is set for March 3 . High: Lab results later found Xanax and marijuana in Bieber's system at the time of his arrest . Bored Bieber? Once by himself in a cell, the bored singer started doing push-ups to pass the time . The arrest video was sought by The Associated Press and other media organizations under Florida's public records law. Attorneys for the 19-year-old singer persuaded a judge to withhold four clips depicting Bieber urinating in a cup for a drug test. According to his lawyers, the video shows Beiber in 'various states of undress which show personal parts'. Innocent: The Canadian pop star has pleaded not guilty to charges of DUI, resisting arrest and having an invalid license . Happy-go-lucky: Bieber was in a surprisingly good mood when he got his mugshot taken following the arrest . Fast and furious: The singer, right, was caught drag-racing through a residential area in his yellow Lamborghini . A source who viewed the video told TMZ: 'Justin is seen several times stumbling around while he was taking his tests. As if he had a problem with his balance ... [the video] also shows Justin taking his various tests and eventually taking a piss. 'The stumbling and going to the bathroom is obviously reason enough for his attorneys to request it be sealed ... If I was trying to paint a picture that my client was innocent ... I wouldn’t want a video of him stumbling around and looking out of it to go public either. The police previously released footage taken after the arrest at the beginning of February, which shows the singer being patted down by officers. Leaning on a table as the police officer gets to work at the task in hand, the Baby hitmaker seemed to be taking his time as he meandered around the area. Complying with orders: Putting on a typically confident display, the 19-year-old singer can be seen strutting around as he follows the officer's orders . Wearing a dark hoodie, baggy black shorts and red trainers, the teen heartthrob is told to remove his shoes as the search takes place. Although the police officer in question seems to be paying close attention to searching Bieber, they found nothing on him after the frisk took place. Later tests revealed his blood alcohol level was below the limit for drivers, but at the age of 19, the young star is still two years underage. Marijuana and Xanax were also found in his system. Bieber has pleaded not guilty to driving under the influence, resisting arrest and invalid-license charges following his January 23 arrest. A trial date has been set for March 3. Meanwhile, Bieber is juggling his many other run-ins with the law. The singer could now be charged with felony vandalism after allegedly pelting his neighbor's property with eggs last month. Police arrive to raid Justin Bieber's Calabasas mansion after Los Angeles law enforcement executed a felony search warrant . The Los Angeles County Sheriff's . Department has sent the case to the district attorney, with officers . strongly recommending prosecution on a more serious felony charge after . an estimated $20,000 in damages was caused. It comes hot on the heels of his party pal Lil Za being charged with three felonies in connection to a raid on Justin's $6million mansion last week. The L.A. County D.A. reportedly charged the rapper with two counts of felony possession of a controlled substance, and another relating to breaking a jail telephone. Police made the charges after they had initially been called to Justin's house following the egg pelting incident. If found guilty he could face up to nine years in prison. Bieber has also been accused of abusing a flight attendant on a private jet until she was forced to hide in the cockpit. Flying high: Bieber and his father allegedly smoked weed on a private plane they took to the Super Bowl . The troubled teen singer and his entourage were said to have smoked so much marijuana on the flight between Canada and New Jersey that the pilots were forced to wear oxygen masks. Bieber his father Jeremy, 38, and ten friends travelled on the leased jet to Teterboro airport ahead of the Super Bowl on Sunday and were allegedly so verbally abusive towards the female flight attendant that she refuses to work for him again. Despite several warnings, the singer and his father Jeremy would not stop verbally abusing the flight attendant, and she eventually hid in the cockpit with the pilots to avoid Bieber and his entourage. In addition to his pending criminal case in Florida, Bieber has another case pending in his native Canada. Growing violent: Bieber is also facing charges in Canada for assaulting a limo driver in an argument over volume . He turned himself into Toronto authorities earlier this month after being charged with assault on a limo driver. TMZ reported that the fight began when Bieber asked for the music to be turned up. The driver obliged, but not as much as Bieber was hoping, so he apparently stuck his hand through the partition to do it himself. The driver swatted his hand away and then it allegedly erupted into a full-on smack fest as Bieber hit the driver in the head multiple times. While Justin has grown increasingly close to his father in the wake of his legal woes, Patti Mallette - who raised the star as a single mother - has admitted she has little control over her son's behaviour. She told Access Hollywood Live: 'I've just gotta let go a little and let him make some of his own decisions. He's growing up. He's 19. He's not my baby. Of course I pray for him and encourage him.'","The video shows Bieber taking a sobriety test following his January 23 arrest for drunk driving .

"A one-of-a-kind First World War fighter plane brought back to life a century after a painstaking reconstruction is up and running in time for its centenary. The Eastchurch Kitten - of which only three prototypes were built - was created as a 'high altitude' fighter to tackle the threat posed by the Zeppelin Airships. The aircraft was designed to be launched from platforms on battleships, cruisers and even torpedo boats. Ready for take off: The Eastchurch Kitten - a First World War prototype plane - will take to the skies again this weekend after being rebuilt by a team of 60 volunteers at the Yorkshire Air Museum . Ready to go: The plane was fired up for the first time today and taken out of the hangar before it flies again this weekend 100 years after the outbreak of the First World War . Gunner: Aircraft engineer Brian Watmouth points the firearm on the front of the plane. It was designed to shoot down Zeppelin Airships . Now the replica has been made by an army of 60 volunteers who worked from faded plans and two photographs. Built with an original wooden frame covered in linen, and using a mixture of specifically-made and re-used materials, the aircraft has been brought back to life at the Yorkshire Air Museum. And today the engine was turned on for the first time as the plane took a turn at Elvington Air Field, North Yorkshire. Ian Reed, manager of the Yorkshire Air Museum, said: 'It went really well. We rolled it out of the hangar and then the engine coughed into life. 'It's been four years of hard work by our volunteers, a long struggle in the workshop. Obviously we were working from old plans, and a lot of the parts have been tricky, we've had to have things specially made and other bits re-used from existing items. Rebuilt: The replica First World War Eastchurch Kitten which has been brought back to life a century after the prototype was made . Flying again: With an original wooden frame covered in linen, and using a mixture of specifically-made and re-used materials, the aircraft has been brought back to life at the Yorkshire Air Museum . 'But it's been worth it, to see the plane running was wonderful. Worth all the hard work. 'I'm especially glad we got it up and running in time for the 100th anniversary of World War I particularly now that the public are starting to appreciate how brave the men were 100 years ago.' He added that the plane was designed in the earliest days of aviation - more than a decade before Charles Lindbergh became the first man to cross the Atlantic in 1927. Mr Reed added: 'The aircrafts were only a decade old, they were still being invented as people were risking their lives and going up in them. 'Over 9,500 pilots were killed in World War I, and it's only right that we should be remembering them as brave and courageous - so I'm glad we've been able to show the Kitten this year.' The original design only made allowance for a 45 horsepower engine. The framework of the remade one-seater aircraft was crafted in the 1980s, but after the wooden skeleton was completed, work halted. Back to life: Volunteers Brian Watmough (left) and Grant Sparks (right) pose with a replica of the Eastchurch Kitten prototype. The aircraft has been built using an original wooden frame and the engine of a Citroen 2CV . Framework: Around 60 volunteers helped to restore the plane to its former glory at the Yorkshire Air Museum, working from only two photographs and faded plans. Above, the reproduction's original wooden framework . Powering up: Mr Sparks works on the plane's 500cc twin-opposed engine, featuring twin-opposed cylinders . Armed: Mr Watmough poses with the aircraft's Lewis gun, which was mounted on to the aircraft's top wing . Weights . Take-off weight - 266kg . Empty weight - 154kg . Dimensions . Wingspan - 19ft 12in . Length - 16ft 7in . Height - 5ft 2in . Wing area - 106.02 sq ft . Performance . Maximum speed - 94mph . It was taken up again four years ago by volunteers at the museum, working from the faded A3 plan and two photographs. It was constructed with specifically made materials such as the engine cowlings, and reused materials, such as the twin-opposed engine, sourced from a Citroen 2CV unit with similar twin opposed cylinders, stripped down to make it light and take unnecessary parts such as the cooling fans and starter motor. The propeller was acquired from one of the museum's local flying clubs. Instruments inside the cockpit came from the national collection archives. And the seating and padding around the controls have all been made with leather. A gun, which fits on top of the aircraft, was also made to measure. Plans: One of the original pictures of the 1917 Eastchurch Kitten that the team of volunteers were working from . Mr Reed said: 'It was to be a disposable, one-operation aircraft, to simply go up, intercept and shoot down the airship, then ditch in the sea. 'When you work on it, you think this must have been quite a frightening prospect, somebody had to get into this tiny aircraft and get up to ten or 15,000 feet with such a small engine, shoot at the huge airship, then crash into the sea and get out as soon as they could. 'But there were people willing to do it, some very gutsy people.' In total, the aircraft cost around £10,000 to restore. The prototype made its first flight on September 1, 1917 but further alterations were needed - and by the time it was finally airworthy, the threat from airships had receded. Prototype: The Eastchurch Kitten, featuring a 45 horsepower engine, made its first flight in September 1917 . Fighter plane: It was designed as a 'high altitude' fighter to tackle the threat posed by the Zeppelin Airships. However, the one-seater aircraft was eventually deemed too fragile and underpowered to enter production .

"A Florida gun show was cancelled after organizers publicly announced Trayvon Martin killer George Zimmerman would be a guest at the event - but Zimmerman will still make a public appearance. ‘The New Orlando Gun Show,’ scheduled for this weekend at Orlando’s Majestic Events Center, was cancelled Thursday despite more than 100 vendors threatening to take the owners to court if the show did not go on. Organizer Mike Piwowarski, who also owns a local gun store, told ClickOrlando that the show was cancelled because of the announced Zimmerman appearance, and Zimmerman posted emails to his Twitter account backing up that claim. The guest of honor: George Zimmerman, pictured with Mike Piwowarski and two other individuals, caused a gun show to be cancelled after he was named the 'featured guest' ‘We've had discussions with The Majestic and they decided to cancel the event because George Zimmerman was making an appearance,’ said Piwowarski. When contacted by MailOnline, Piwowarski clarified that Zimmerman was to be a paying vendor who wanted to attend for a meet and greet - he would not have charged for any autographs. Zimmerman's intent was to be able to attend an event where he would be more free to be himself, where there would be less negativity than he has encountered in other settings, according to Piwowarski. When asked if organizers had considered possible backlash to Zimmerman's attendance, Piwowarski replied 'I’m not sure that we were gauging reaction at all.. it was someone who was legally . able to have a table.' Not allowed: Majestic's owners said in an email posted online by Zimmerman that the gun aficionado is not allowed on their property . Piwowarski was notified of the event's cancellation via email, but the Majestic's owners are not returning any of his messages. 'it was very detrimental to Majestic's image as a local business for Arms Room to post on Twitter saying that George Zimmerman would be a guest of honor without confirming that with Majestic and without getting prior approval from Majestic management,' general manager Vikash Mahadeowrite in an email provided to MailOnline. Piwowarski was also quick to point out that, per the terms of their contract with the Majestic's owners, they were not required to clear any vendors with management ahead of time. He also refuted claims the announcement was posted on Twitter and said the backlash was generated by Majestic management's reaction, not by the Arms Room post on Facebook. A picture posted to the Facebook page for The Arms Room, Piwowarski’s gun shop, shows Zimmerman recently visiting the store with the caption ‘we had a friend stop by recently.’ Comments on the picture ranged from surprise to outrage, and that is what led Majestic’s owners to call off the whole thing, according to the station. ‘The event center asked us to do a few things when they found out Mr. Zimmerman was present; pull down posts, pull down announcement that he was going to be there.,’ Piwowarski recalled during a ClickOrlando interview. ‘We did all of that when they asked us to do it,’ Piwowarski continued. ‘They rescheduled the event. Then they later went on to cancel it again, after we complied with all of their requests.’ The organizers and more than 100 gun vendors had a year-long contract with the Majestic and plan to go to court if the show does not go on as scheduled, Piwowarski told the station. The show will not go on: The gun show's organizers have confirmed the show has been cancelled and have plans to take the Majestic's owners to court . The show’s cancellation will cost the vendors a combined $100,000, Piwowarski claims, and organizers plan to move forward with a lawsuit to recoup that money. 'The attorneys are down at the courthouse right now,' he said while speaking to MailOnline. ‘Mr Zimmerman will not be permitted on Majestic’s property for the gun show,’ manager Vikash Mahadeo wrote in an email posted online by Zimmerman. Zimmerman also tweeted ‘another company bowing to threats of being labeled racist’ in response to the show’s cancellation. Messages left with Majestic’s owner by MailOnline seeking further comment have not yet been returned. The quarterly gun shows will need to find a new home, Piwowarski explained, and Zimmerman is free to attend and will make an appearance Saturday morning at 10.00am at a mini event at the store featuring a few of the other vendors slated to attend the bigger show. 'If Mr Z desires to be there, and . he can legally be there…we don’t do any discrimination.’","'The New Orlando Gun Show' was cancelled after organizers announced George Zimmerman would be in attendance .

"Ann Saville's partner was told that she had died suddenly - only to discover she was still alive . The family of a cancer patient was told in a phone call by hospital staff she had died suddenly – only to discover she was still alive after rushing to her bedside. Astonishingly, Ann Saville’s partner realised she was still breathing when he held her hand to say a final goodbye. ‘She was still warm and I could feel she was pulsing,’ said John Harrison. ‘I said to the nurses: “She’s still alive!” and they said: “She’s not, it’s this involuntary reaction”.’ After eventually realising their mistake, nurses summoned a doctor but Mr Harrison claims they waited more than an hour for her to arrive. In a further twist, it is now feared leukaemia patient Ms Saville, 71, may have suffered brain damage during the episode. Last night, she remained critically ill. ‘I cannot believe the course of events,’ said Mr Harrison, a photographer. ‘They’re professionals – they’re supposed to know what they’re doing.’ The blunder at St James’s Hospital, Leeds, is the latest in a series of scandals to hit the NHS in recent months. In November, The Mail on Sunday unearthed a catalogue of hospital mortuary mix-ups in which dead bodies were abandoned for days. Ms Saville, from Pudsey, Leeds, was diagnosed with leukaemia in December and initially had a ten-day course of chemotherapy. On February 21, she rang Mr Harrison, her partner of more than 30 years, to say doctors had told her she would be home in five days. ‘She was doing brilliantly and there were no problems,’ he said.But at 5.30 the following morning, he was called by a nurse. ‘She said Ann had been found slumped over the bed. She said she was not breathing, there was no pulse, and there were no signs of life. That’s what the nurse said – verbatim. Then she said, “Don’t jump in your car and rush down here, because there’s nothing we can do.”’ He was told a resuscitation team had worked on Ms Saville for half an hour before stopping. After putting the phone down, Mr Harrison called Ann’s family to break the news, including her brother Philip. Philip Plant, 64, added: ‘I phoned the hospital and asked if it was OK to come up. But the nurse said: “I’m sorry love, she just passed away a few minutes ago.” John Harrison says when he arrived at the hospital: ‘I told the nurses, “I want to say goodbye to her.” The nurses showed me in and said, “Ignore the fact she looks as if she is breathing, it’s an involuntary reaction. She is dead; there’s nothing we can do.” ‘I got hold of her hand and I knew straight away that she was still alive.’ When Mr Harrison swore at the nurses, saying it was clear she was alive, he was told he was being ‘emotional’. But he responded: ‘She is still alive. I want you to do something, and I want you to do it now!’ Finally, a nurse checked and found a pulse. Mr Harrison is Ms Saville's partner of more than 30 years . Mr Harrison claimed: ‘Then they tried to tell me she was dead and she had come back to life. But I’m absolutely positive that they were wrong, and that she was alive all along.’ He continued: ‘She did not look dead at all to me. She looked like she was suffering. Her breath was staccato, she wasn’t breathing easily, she was laid out on her back gasping for life. If I had not been there, I am sure she would have died. ‘I told one of the doctors: “You were going to take her down to the morgue and put her in the fridge, weren’t you?”’ Mr Harrison claimed from the time he told nurses she was still alive, at about 6.30am, it took an hour for them to summon a registrar. ‘She confirmed Ann was still alive,’ he said. Mr Harrison said he had ‘no idea why it took so long’ to raise a doctor, adding: ‘Nobody’s telling me anything. They keep saying: “We are really sorry that this has happened.” But nobody will actually say why it happened, or even what happened.’ Mr Harrison, 58, said he wanted an external investigation as he did not trust the hospital to launch its own inquiry. Ms Saville, who has two teenaged grandchildren, is currently unresponsive, said her partner, but her eyes are open. ‘She has no reaction when people walk into the room,’ he said. Error: Nurses at St James's Hospital, Leeds, eventually realised their mistake and summoned a doctor . Ms Saville was diagnosed with leukaemia in December and initially had a ten-day course of chemotherapy . After the incident, doctors told him they did not believe she would last more than 72 hours – but that was two weeks ago. Mr Harrison said he was told the resuscitation team had worked on her for about half an hour prior to the nurse calling him. ‘They said her brain was starved of oxygen for so long, that she would be brain damaged.’ He thought the staff’s belief she was dead may have meant she suffered additional brain damage – a claim the hospital trust declined to comment on last night. Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust said it was investigating. Dr David Jackson, clinical director, said: ‘We acknowledge this is a very troubling time for Ms Saville’s family and can fully understand why they are finding it difficult to deal with this tragic turn of events. ‘Our clinical team, including our matron and consultants, are reviewing Ms Saville and meeting with the family on a regular basis. This is a very complex and unusual circumstance and we have set up an investigation to look at the detail of the situation. ‘In the meantime we will continue to do our best to support the family and to provide answers as and when they become available.’","Ann Saville's partner, John Harrison, realised she was still breathing when he held her hand to say a final goodbye .

"A Florida mother was arrested after being filmed beating a 12-year-old girl in front of a crowd of students at her daughter’s school. Irisdaly Rios, 35, fought Ashley Perez Tuesday outside Hialeah Middle School, after the two argued over the mother’s belief the young girl bullies her daughter. The altercation was caught on a cell phone camera by student Damian Portal and put online by his mother – it resulted in Rios being arrested and charged with simple battery. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . At odds: Irisdaly Rios, 35, faces assault and battery charges after being filmed Tuesday beating up 12-year-old Ashley Perez in front of a Florida middle school . Battered: The young girl's neck was scratched and she claims a tooth was broken in the melee . The video shows the woman pointing to her car, where her daughter is believed to have been sitting, and shouting at Perez. The young girl shouts back, and then backs away from Rios before the irate mother loses her cool. ‘She got out of the car and saying . she was going to hit or or whatever,’ Portal told CBS Miami of Rios. ‘She started holding and touching her and then she backed away, she . approached her and started swinging.’ Rios lunges forward, swinging at Perez, a loud smack is heard as the two women struggle, and the crowd keeps egging them on while shouting ‘child abuse’ and that Rios will be arrested. An unidentified woman breaks the pair up before Rios goes back for more, this time punching the girl in the mouth. The two are then broken up again as Perez is seen calling the police while Rios tries to fight through others to knock the phone out of the girl’s hand and the crowd further taunts her. Heated conversation: Ashley Perez initially walked up to Irisdaly Rios' car thinking she could patch things up, but things quickly escalated . The windup: Rios is seen pushing the girl away before winding up to hit her . ‘It was crazy,’ said Portal. Rios claimed to NBC Miami that Perez ‘bullies my daughter every day.’ The young girl admitted to disagreements with Rios’ daughter, but says she only approached the car because she wanted to make things right. ‘She got aggressive, and I think she felt her daughter was in danger,’ the 12-year-old told NBC Miami. That's why I walked to the car, because usually, if it was another mother, she'll be like, 'Oh, what's happening to my daughter. Let's fix this up.’ The young girl showed the station the scratch marks on her neck and said she has a broken tooth from being punched. Fight: Rios hits Perez as the crowd cheers the young girl on, calling for her to fight back . The end?: This unidentified woman breaks the fight up, but Rios hasn't had enough . Round two: Rios goes after Perez again, this time a loud smack draws calls of 'child abuse' from the crowd . Not so fast: Rios tries to make a getaway while Perez calls the police as witnesses shout the woman will be arrested . ‘I've got scratches on my back, my tooth is broken, and my head started hurting a lot,’ she added. Multiple witnesses told police Rios was the primary aggressor, according to CBS Miami. The video backs their claims. Portal’s mother Marianne Daly uploaded the video to Facebook after she saw it because ‘everyone has to know what’s happening in school. ‘We can’t project violence,’ she told NBC Miami. ‘They have enough violence in video games, TV shows.  They don’t need that.’ Rios quickly posted her $1,500 bail and will see Perez again in court on a date to be determined.","Irisdaly Rios, 35, was filmed Tuesday beating up 12-year-old Ashley Perez outside a Florida middle school .

"A southern Indiana woman who prosecutors say gunned down a Kentucky man during a sexual role-playing game has been sentenced to 45 years in prison. Lisa Shuler, 32, of New Albany, apologized during a hearing Wednesday in a Floyd County courtroom for shooting and killing 49-year-old Charles Pierce of Louisville, last fall. Shuler said she brought shame to her own family and hurt Pierce’s family. Femme fatale: Lisa Shuler (left), 32, was sentenced to 45 years after pleading guilty to the May 2013 murder of Charles Pierce, 49 (right), during a sexual encounter . Act of contrition: Shuler apologized in court for the pain she caused to the victim's family and to her own loved ones . ‘I know I can’t take away their hurt or pain,’ she said during a brief statement. She pleaded guilty to murder in January. Shuler allegedly first told 911 dispatchers that Pierce was a home intruder. Later, however, she told investigators that she and Pierce had been involved in a kinky role play after they found 200 deleted texts on her phone. She also tried to delete texts from Pierce's phone when she called 911. According to an affidavit, Shuler finished performing a sex act and then pulled a gun from a holster on her belt and fired the weapon until it was empty. Investigators found the man, pants down, had been shot multiple times with a .45-caliber handgun at close range. He was rushed to a hospital, but died a short time later. Chief Deputy Prosecutor Steven Owen said Shuler feared Pierce intended to pass photos of them having sex on to her estranged husband and that the killing was premeditated. Owen read a statement by Pierce’s mother, Mildred Pierce, during the hearing, as the elderly woman was too overcome with emotion to speak, the News and Tribune. Bloody scene: Officers who responded to Shuler's home on Wabash Avenue on the night of May 6, 2013, found Pierce lying on the ground riddled with bullets . Sex, lies and photos: Shuler admitted that she murdered Pierce because he had photos from their previous sexual encounter, which she feared would fall into the hands of her estranged husband, Brandon (right) ‘I lost my youngest son,’ the mother of three said in the statement. ‘The hole that has been left cannot ever be filled. ‘He was always coming over and I still expect to hear the back door open and to hear him holler, “Mom.” He lived next door to me. Every time I go out on the deck, there’s his house.’ Shuler’s grandmother, Iretta Michael, said the murder should never have taken place. ‘If it hadn’t been for drugs, alcohol and perverse sex, neither one of them would be lost,’ she said. She added that the 32-year-old woman was raised by a loving family in a Christian home, 'but chose to go the other way.' ‘She is going to pay 45 years, and we have lost her,’ Michael told the station WLKY. Appearing in court Wednesday dressed in a green striped jumpsuit with her hands shackled, Shuler took the microphone to address the relatives of the victim. ‘I apologize to the family,’ Shuler said. ‘I know I can’t take away their hurt or pain.' Happier times: Lisa (second left) and Brandon (far right), both raised in devout Christina families, were married for 10 years . Charles Pierce’s grief-stricken mother, who suffers from breast cancer, spoke after the sentencing, saying that Shuler's apology did not ring true, and that only a life term in prison would have satisfied her. What started out as a sexual escapade ended in Charles Pierce's death on the night of May 6, 2013. According to his mother, the 49-year-old told her that he was going out and planned to visit her later that night of the following morning. He never made it back. Police say Pierce drove to Shuler's home on Wabash Avenue, where the two engaged in 'rape fantasy' role play. According to the affidavit, Shuler began to perform a sex act on him, and once she was done, she pulled a .45 caliber handgun and fire on her sex partner until the clip was empty. The woman then called 911 to report that she shot a man who had tried to break into her home. Officers who arrived on the scene found Pierce lying on the floor riddled with bullets. His pants and underwear were pulled down to his knees. Mother's heartbreak: Mildred Pierce, pictured left in court this week and right shortly after her son's murder, said that she was not satisfied with the 45-year sentence . During questioning, Shuler changed her home invasion story, admitting that she shot Pierce because he was in possession of photos depicting their previous sexual encounter, which the married woman feared would fall into the hands of her husband of 10 years, Brandon. According to her Facebook page, Shuler worked at a medical office. Her estranged husband owns a guitar shop. Her final post appeared on her account on the morning of the murder. In the message, Shuler uploaded a picture of a man at prayer and quoted Isaiah 12:2: 'Surely God is my salvation; I will trust and not be afraid. The LORD, the LORD, is my strength and my song; he has become my salvation.'","Lisa Shuler, 32, admitted to police she emptied her .45-caliber handgun into the body of Charles Pierce, 49, after performing a sex act on him May 2013 .

Details are revealed in a new ‘LifeLines report published on the road safety website comparethemarkings.com . The report says repainting road markings on major A roads, could cut road deaths by up to a third. In Scotland some 43 per cent of markings need immediate replacement or need to be scheduled for replacement. The standard of markings is ‘of significant concern’ and in places ‘inadequate,’ says the report. In Wales 63per cent of markings on motorways and 48 per cent on dual-carriageways need replacing immediately or need to be scheduled for replacement. Only 1 in 100 (1per cent) make the ‘excellent’ grade. Mr Lee said: ‘Despite continuing to give assurances of their commitment to road safety, those responsible for the upkeep of our roads continue to neglect the most cost-effective safety device available to road engineers, the white line. The M25 on an unusually quite day. The white lines on the stretch of road near the Dartford Tunnel need to repainted (file picture) ‘It is shameful that half of the markings on roads in England are so worn out that they need to be replaced. These markings have already been paid for because we, as taxpayers, are paying to have the roads maintained properly, including the markings, and this is just not happening. The robust evidence in our survey and in this report proves this to be the case.’ A914 Newport on Tay-Balmullo                   84% . A92 Kirkaldy-Dunfermline                           68% .

Mr Lee said: ‘The humble white line can save lives and it is therefore important that they are maintained to a sufficient standard that they do their job properly.  If a line is so worn that it cannot be seen, it may as well not be there.’ He added: ‘If I went to the supermarket, bought a bag of apples, got them home and found that half of them were rotten, I am sure that every right-thinking person would agree that I should get my money back. ‘With that in mind, what should our reaction be when we discover that half of road markings across all type of roads, whilst not rotten, are such a state that they are in need of immediate replacement or should be scheduled now for replacement?’","Just one in six road markings on motorways in England has been deemed 'excellent'

"A car mechanic has been revealed as the mystery winner of last week’s £108million EuroMillions jackpot. The identity of the man, who is also an amateur racing driver, is expected to be unveiled today. The massive win on Friday gives him Britain’s fourth biggest National Lottery scoop – and catapults him straight into the world of the mega-wealthy. Scroll down for video . The identity of the man who won £108million on EuroMillions will be revealed tomorrow. So far, all that is known about the winner is that he is a mechanic and racing driver from Surrey . The lucky winner's wealth now exceeds that of musicians Robbie Williams, left, and George Michael, right, who both have reported fortunes of £105million . The winner, from Coulsdon, Surrey, is taking home £107,932,603.20, making him the 745th wealthiest person in the UK. It . also means he is worth more than celebrities such as George Michael . and  Robbie Williams (who both have £105million) and David Bowie . (£100million), according to the latest Sunday Times Rich List. Coulsdon was abuzz with speculation about his identity last night. One local mechanic said: ‘I wish it was me. We’re all desperate to know who it is – that’s a life-changing amount of money.’ Affordable: The mystery man could soon be behind the wheel of a a Lamborghini Veneno, one of the world's most expensive cars - a snip a just £2.4 million . Peter . Davy, steward at the Victoria working men’s club in Coulsdon, said: . ‘We’re calling every mechanic we know. We’re desperate to know who it . is. If he’s got any sense, he’ll be long gone, booking a flight to the . Bahamas by now.’ The winner . used numbers 6, 24, 25, 27 and 30 and lucky stars 5 and 9 to become the . first Briton to win the EuroMillions jackpot this year. All . he has to do now is decide how to spend his new-found wealth. It would . enable him to buy the 1,100-acre Greek island of Omfori, which is on the . market for just over £41million, as well as a Lamborghini Veneno, one . of the world’s most expensive cars at £2.4million – and still have . £64million left over. However, . if he wants to blow nearly all his money in one go, he could buy one of . the world’s most exclusive homes – a 21-bedroom house in London’s . Mayfair, which would set him back £90million. He joins an elite club of British Lottery winners who have each banked more than £100million. Top of the rich list are Colin and Chris Weir, from Largs in Ayrshire, who won £161million on EuroMillions in July 2011. But . winning more than £148million in August 2012 created difficulties for . Adrian and Gillian Bayford, from Haverhill in Suffolk. They split up . months later. The third biggest British winner scooped £113million in October 2010, but decided not to go public. The winning ticket-holder of last night's EuroMillions has shot to sixth place on the National Lottery Rich List. So far, nobody has come forward to claim the bumper prize, Camelot said. Here are the official top 10 biggest winners since the lottery began: . 1. Colin and Chris Weir: £161,653,000The . husband and wife, from Largs in Ayrshire, said they were 'tickled pink' after becoming Europe's biggest lottery winners in July 2011. Married . for 30 years and with two children, the life-changing £161 million . prize catapulted them into the Sunday Times Rich List above Beatle Ringo . Starr and Sir Tom Jones. Psychiatric . nurse Mrs Weir, 55, and Mr Weir, 64, who worked as a TV cameraman and . studio manager for 23 years, have reportedly bought a fleet of cars for . friends since their win as well as a mansion. 2. Adrian and Gillian Bayford: £148,656,000Children's . nurse Gillian, 40, and record seller Adrian, 41, from Haverhill, . Suffolk, said they planned to fork out on luxury holidays and cars when . they won in August last year. Adrian . joked to his wife that he had not bought any tickets, before she told . him to be quiet as she was trying to get their children to sleep as he . celebrated the win. The couple have since separated. 3. Anonymous: £113,019,926One British ticket scooped the massive prize in October 2010 but decided not to go public. 4. Anonymous: £107,900,000 .

Self-confessed white van man Nigel Page, 43, scooped a cool £56 million in February 2010. The . skydiving enthusiast, who lived in a three-bedroom semi near . Cirencester, Wiltshire, married his girlfriend Justine, 42, and moved . into a mansion in the Cotswolds. It . was reported that he paid ex-wife Wendy, 43, £2million after she made a . legal claim for £8million. The pair had separated 10 years before his . bumper win. 9. Anonymous: £46,432,285 . One British ticket scooped the massive prize in February last year but decided not to go public. 10. Les and Sam Scadding: £45,570,835Unemployed . mechanic Les Scadding, 58, and his wife Samantha Peachey-Scadding, 38, . from Caerleon, South Wales, bought one of two winning tickets which . shared a £90million jackpot in November 2009. Grandfather . Mr Scadding was £68 overdrawn on his bank account on the day he bought . his lucky ticket and had also beaten testicular cancer. The other £45million-winning EuroMillions ticket was bought by a syndicate of seven office workers based in Merseyside. The winners - dubbed the Magnificent Seven - were employed by Hewlett Packard to carry out IT work at a BT office in Liverpool. John . Walsh, 57, James Bennett, 28, Sean Connor, 32, Alex Parry, 19, Emma . Cartwright, 23, Ceri Scullion, 35, and Donna Rhodes, 39, each banked . £6.5million. Sunseeker superyacht . If a life on the ocean waves appeals then yesterday's winner should get hold of the latest Sunseeker catalogue. The Dorset company's brand new 155 model would be a ideal choice but at a cool £32million it would take a large chunk out of their new found fortune. Boasting five bedrooms, enabling then to host up to 10 guests at once, the four-deck yacht also has space for 11 members of staff. Other perks include a nightclub, day room, 'beach club' and a panoramic viewing platform - which could allow guests a perfect view of the Monaco Grand Prix if Mr Jordan decides to attend the society event. The yacht is 155ft long and weighs a total of 200 tonnes, with a maximum speed of 22 knots (25mph), and can travel 4,000 nautical miles in a single journey. Filling up the boat's 60,000-litre engine with diesel will cost £30,000 every time. Rolls Royce Phantom . Lottery winners and Rolls Royce are the perfect match and a top of the range Phantom model is easily within budget at £300,000. The Phantom is a classic choice for the super rich, and they are all assembled by hand at the Rolls-Royce factory in Goodwood, West Sussex. A-list celebrities David Beckham, Simon Cowell, Jennifer Lopez, Sylvester Stallone and Eddie Murphy have all been spotted riding in the car. It is also a favourite of the royal family and heads of state worldwide – an earlier version of the Phantom was presented to the Queen as a gift on her Silver Jubilee. However, to get the full experience they would need to add a chauffeur. Private Island . Flashy cars, superyachts and private jets are all very well, but to really join ranks of the super rich you'll need a private Island. And they could do a lot worse than the stunning Greek Island of Omfori. The uninhabited island located in the Ionian Sea covers some 4 500 000 sq metres (1112 acres) and is currently up for sale for £40million. Widely considered one of the most beautiful islands in the region, it features a beautiful beach surrounded by tranquil turquoise waters. Private jet . First class just doesn't cut the mustard when you've got £100 million burning a hole in your pocket so a private jet is really the only way to fly. Learjet are the market leaders and we think their 60xr model would be the sensible choice. With a range of 2,405 nautical miles it shoud be easily capable of taking then and three passengers wherever they want to go. The cabin is decked out with leather and walnut veneer and it's easily within budget at £8million. A flat at One Hyde Park . It is the most expensive block of flats in the world with entry level apartments starting at £5million and the penthouse going for eyewatering £65million. Buyers will join a roll call of billionaire residents, including developer Christian Candy, who owns two properties at One Hyde Park. The property tycoon, who built the apartments with his brother Nick, owns two separate flats worth £31m and £26.2m on the 10th floor.Two other apartments were sold for a combined £136 million to Ukrainian mining tycoon Rinat Akhmetov, who is thought to be investing a further £50 million to knock the properties together and refit them. - Do you know the EuroMillions winner?

"A Breaking Bad fanatic has shown his support for the hit TV show by getting its main characters tattooed on his arm. James Allan, 26, spent more than £2,000 having the hyper-realistic tribute done over a 40-hour period at a tattoo studio in Stirling, Scotland.

Mr Allan, an electrician, said he was delighted with the high-quality tribute to the U.S. drama, which has captivated fans across the world since its launch in 2008. 'The realism of it is crazy. I like tattoos and I've been looking to get a sleeve for a while, but I wasn't sure what at first,' he said. 'The . tattoo includes the most important elements from the show. There are . four colour portraits that are connected with further details. A long wait: Mr Allan is pictured getting the tattoo done over a 40-hour period at a studio in Stirling, Scotland .

Difference: Mr Allan had the tattoo printed on his arm to cover up a tribal tattoo (left) he previously had done . Mr Allan said he had decided to get the unusual artwork done after his tattoo artist friend, Chris Meighan, 34, appealed for a live canvas on Facebook. He chose to get it printed on his right arm to cover up a tribal tattoo he had previously had done without having to undergo laser surgery. Hyper-realistic tattoos are inkings that are designed to look as realistic as possible. They may feature skilled drawings of people and objects, or employ special techniques, such as shading or 3D effects. Popular hyper-realistic images include those of bullet wounds, insects crawling on the skin and the body's interior. Chris Meighan, owner of Studio 52 tattoo parlour in Stirling, said such tattoos were becoming increasingly popular in Britain. 'Colour realism portraits are big in the U.S., but a lot of people now want them in the UK as well,' he said. 'It is exactly like traditional tattooing, but a lot is more possible now. People can have whatever they want.' 'I already had a tattoo on my arm. It was a tribal that I got at a house party when I was 17 from my pal's dad,' he said. 'At . the time it was macho with the big tribal thing, but I started to hate . it. When you see a tribal it makes you think, ""how many people have . actually been in a tribe?"" 'I . had been to a few tattooists around Scotland and asked them if they . could cover it up, because I really didn't want to get laser surgery. 'Chris . was confident enough in his ability that he would be able to cover it up. Now it is hardly even there. You can't even see the old tattoo anymore.' Breaking .

"They were voted the biggest fashion faux pas of last year, but 'meggings' - that's male leggings - could become a male wardrobe staple this season. Two British designers have unveiled a range of meggings, which they hope will enable men to 'both look great and feel comfortable in leggings.' Luke Shipley and Tom Hunt established sTitch Leggings in 2012 after they were forced to wear 'ill-fitting female leggings' to a themed party. New trend? Meggings, male leggings made from lycra, could become a seasonal staple thanks to two designers who are trying to make them mainstream . This embarrassing fashion faux pas inspired the duo to join forces with friend Joe Hollingworth and set about designing a legging range just for men. Priced at £25, sTitch leggings are inspired by celebrities such as Russel Brand and Justin Bieber, who both favour meggings. They come in an array of colourful designs such as rainbow-coloured diamonds and hot pink - and even come complete with back pockets for your valuables. Stylish?

Vibrant designs: Priced at £25, sTitch leggings are available in an array of fun designs and even come complete with a back pocket to store your valuables . Writing on their website, the team say: 'We envision a day where men can wear what they want as opposed to what they should, to achieve this, we will strive to design and produce garments that liberate the modern man from conventional male fashion. 'We grew up wearing, doing and saying what we wanted. We believe this is how life should be lived. 'We have therefore made it our goal to expand this way of life and have built sTitch Leggings as a vehicle to do so.' Speaking to the Express, they added: 'Meggings are the natural evolution from the skinny jean and the once widespread baggy jean. Celebrity inspiration: Fans of the . tight-fitting apparel include Russell Brand (left) and Justin Bieber . (right), who inspired the range . 'Everyone knows leggings are an incredibly comfortable and stylish garment - why should women have all the fun? 'From Henry VIII to David Bowie, style icons through the centuries have accepted them as an essential garment in their wardrobe.

"A teenager claims to be so terrified of most food that she refuses to eat anything apart from tinned spaghetti. College student Leah Frost, from Leeds, has shunned most other foods since she was a child, despite the best efforts of her mother, Yvonne. She has tried everything to persuade her 17-year-old daughter to have a varied diet, including therapy, but nothing has worked. Leah Frost only eats tinned spaghetti, white bread, cheese, chips and sponge cake due to food phobia that has made her scared to try other foods . College student Leah Frost, from Leeds, has shunned most other foods since she was a child, despite the best efforts of her mother, Yvonne . The only other foods Leah has been persuaded to add to her limited menu are chips, bread, cheese and sponge cake. Even the food Leah eats must be specific brands and varieties. The . tinned spaghetti must be Heinz, the bread must be Warburton's and it . must be Lancashire cheese from the supermarket Morrisons. Yet despite her poor high fat, sugar and carbohydrate laden diet Leah remains a svelte size eight . Yet despite her poor high fat, sugar and carbohydrate laden diet Leah remains a svelte size eight. She said: 'If someone puts something down in front of me and I know it isn't right it makes me feel anxious and scared to eat it. 'Even with the food I do eat it has to be right. Like with chips - I can't just eat any chips. 'It puts me in some difficult situations when I'm out with my friends because a lot of them don't know how bad my phobia is.' Ms Frost thinks Leah's phobia stems from when she was a baby and she tried to breast feed despite not producing any milk. As a result Leah's weight fell for five weeks before her mother was told she should be bottle-feeding her baby. She said: 'I felt responsible for starving my baby, so then I just let her eat what she want. 'I was told by doctors that if I just put food in front of her eventually she would be hungry enough to eat it, but having starved my daughter once I didn't want to do it again. 'We've tried everything - I've even sent her to have cognitive behavioural therapy, but after having it for a year the only progress she had made was to try a slice of raw carrot and she still didn't like it.' Leah said: 'I was a bridesmaid at my auntie's wedding and she knows about my food phobia so she had a chat with the caterers to arrange for me to have a cheese sandwich. 'But when it came out I took one look at it and knew I couldn't eat it. 'It was on what most people would probably consider really nice bread with seeds, and the cheese was thick. They'd even put a little flag in the top. 'I had to slip it over to my mum when nobody was looking.' Leah's mother and boyfriend will offer to take food for her if they can see she is uncomfortable. But the unhealthy diet is already having a detrimental effect on her health. She feels tired all the time and her iron count is low.

'She complains of feeling tired all the time and she has regular blood tests that always come back with some sort of deficiency. 'We got through phases where we will try really hard to get her to eat more normal food, and then we go back to square one when we realise that she's never going to change.' Sarah Hanratty, an expert nutritionist, said: 'This diet is lacking in key micronutrients and is high in refined carbohydrate. 'Over the longer-term a diet like this can lead to insulin resistance possibly resulting in diabetes and obesity.'

"Green spender: People spend £30,000 a year on their garden, a third of which goes on planets . Homeowners spend £30,000 on their garden over a lifetime, a study has found. Researchers found the typical green-fingered adult will spend a third of the amount on plants alone. The rest of cost includes keeping the lawn, flowerbeds, shrubs and trees in tip-top condition, as well as forking out for garden buildings, ornaments and patios. The survey by online garden centre, GardeningExpress.co.uk, asked 540 gardeners about their spending habits. They found gardeners spend £9,500 during the course of their life on plants alone. This included buying seeds, bulbs, bedding plants, shrubs, trees, grass seed, turf and vegetable plants. The second highest expenditure was on hard landscaping at £9,000, with homeowners changing their patio or deck six times over the course of their gardening lifetime. Garden furniture, including tables, chairs and outdoor lighting accounted for £3,600 of the total amount. Those questioned said they needed something decent to sit on or relax in to enjoy their garden which explained why furniture was updated or replaced around eight times. This was closely followed by essential tools like spades, forks, rakes, shears and secateurs which totalled just under £3,500. Gardeners admitted to spending over £1,800 on their sheds and greenhouses claiming they replaced their shed four times and even their greenhouse twice. The cost of garden electrics, including a lawnmower, strimmer, hedge trimmer and garden vacuum, came in at £1,320 with the remaining spend, £720, being used on the barbecues gardeners purchased for the summer months. One male gardener, who was involved in the research, said: ‘I spend hours in the garden but had no idea quite how much it was costing me. About £3,500 is spent on essential tools like spades, forks, rakes, shears and secateurs . ‘For that I could buy myself a decent car or give my daughter a deposit for her house. I see my garden as an investment – if it looks good then it adds value to my property which has to be a good thing.’ A female respondent added: ‘Plants are my biggest weakness. Even if I just pop to the garden centre for a browse around, I end up leaving with a car full. Many I don’t really need – my garden is full up already, but I always manage to find a space to plant it in, even if it means digging up something else and giving that to a neighbour.’ Another added: ‘I never scrimp when it comes to garden furniture. It has to look good and it has to be comfortable. My husband loves pottering around in the garden. I like to use the garden for relaxing – a sun lounger on the deck with a glass of wine beside me and a good book is my perfect summers day. ‘ . The second highest expenditure is on hard-surfacing with adults changing their patios six times . Chris Bonnett from GardeningExpress.co.uk said: ‘I would imagine very few gardeners would expect their garden to be costing them £30,000. ‘Many of the tools and electricals can last for years. It’s only plants that you need to buy every year so it’s very easy to lose track of how much you are actually shelling out.’ A study last year found those who spend their free time pruning the roses or pottering in the vegetable patch are trimmer than their non-gardening neighbours. Women were a dress size smaller, while men who went to an allotment could expect to be around a stone lighter. Previous studies have credited gardening with a host of benefits, from raising zest for life to boosting happiness.","A third of the expense is spent on plants alone, researchers found .

"Home-owners in one of Britain’s busiest commuter towns were today celebrating the extension of the £14.8billion Crossrail scheme to include Reading. From 2019, the cross-London fast-train service will also include the busy Berkshire commuter  town – giving a fast track for workers in the City,  the Government announced. As well as benefiting commuters, the improved travel links are also likely to push up house prices in the Reading and Twyford area. The £14bn Crossrail scheme will extend as far as Reading to the west of London, it has been announced today. Pictured is the new extended route . There had been intense speculation that the line could be extended further west from Maidenhead  - given a major refurbishment of reading station - although until today there had been no firm decision on this. Crossrail stretches from Berkshire in the west to as far east as Shenfield in Essex and also takes in spurs to Heathrow Airport in west London and to Abbey Wood in south east London. Transport Minister Stephen Hammond said that, once Crossrail services began across the whole line in 2019, passengers travelling to London from Reading and other Thames Valley stations would be able to reach more destinations across London without the need to change at Paddington. Once operational, Crossrail services are expected to serve Maidenhead on a four-trains-per-hour basis as originally planned, with two of these services continuing to Reading via Twyford. In addition, the planned future Great Western franchise service pattern from Reading to London will not change. Twice hourly, semi-fast services and existing fast mainline services will continue, calling at the same stations as today. Mr Hammond said the Reading extension will also generate some cost savings from reduced infrastructure enhancements at Maidenhead and Slough, and only minor works will be required at Twyford and Reading to accommodate Crossrail services. A computer generated image of a Crossrail train. It is thought the move will boost property prices in the Ready and Twyford area . Reading town centre - which is now to be included in the Crossrail project. The route will now run from Reading through to Shenfield, Essex . Rail minister Mr Hammond said the extension of Crossrail to Reading was ‘further proof of our commitment to deliver a transport network fit for the 21st century.’ He said: ‘It will improve connectivity and deliver greater choice and convenience for passengers travelling into London. It will also make better use of the already congested Great Western Main Line.’ He said this would free up capacity for potential direct services from Reading to Heathrow as part of the western access scheme. The minister said he had also asked Network Rail to look at the cost benefit analysis of ‘increasing the number of faster trains between Reading and Paddington.’ Mike Brown , managing director of London Underground and London Rail, said:  ‘Extending Crossrail to Reading will provide passengers with more journey options and will create better connections and direct services between Reading, Twyford and destinations across London without the need to interchange at Paddington.’ Trains will be introduced to run Crossrail services as follows: . Ministers said Crossrail will boost . London’s rail capacity by 10per cent by connecting Reading and Heathrow . in the west with Shenfield and Abbey Wood in the east. Up to 24 trains . an hour will run between Paddington and Whitechapel during peak times. A Transport department spokesman said: ’It is estimated that Crossrail will generate at least 75,000 business opportunities and support the equivalent of 55,000 full-time jobs around the UK. Three out of 5 businesses currently winning work on the project are based outside London.’ London mayor  Boris Johnson said: ‘I am thrilled that the people of Reading and Twyford will be able to take advantage of Crossrail, putting them on the doorstep of London's main employment centres by directly linking them to the City and West End in world-class style.’ Shadow transport secretary Mary Creagh MP said: ‘Labour in government safeguarded the potential Crossrail route from Maidenhead to Reading, so we welcome the decision to extend Crossrail to Reading. ‘This is good news for commuters struggling with a cost-of-living crisis and will make the most of Labour's investment in Reading station, which should help the Thames Valley economy to grow faster.’ Reading East Conservative MP Rob Wilson, although welcoming the extension, said: ‘This can only be seen as stage one in the process of delivering Crossrail for Reading. This first phase will not reap the full benefits that Crossrail can and should bring to benefit people and businesses in Reading and the wider region. ‘Because there will be so many stops between here and London, journey times to London will be no faster than they are now.’","£14.7bn Crossrail scheme will be extended to include commuter town of Reading, Berkshire .

"'Unduly lenient': Suleman Maknojioa was given a 40-week suspended sentence after his defence argued that his wife couldn't speak English . The suspended sentence handed to a Koran teacher who sexually abused an 11-year-old girl will be reviewed by the Attorney General after protests from Muslim women's groups. Suleman Maknojioa from Blackburn was given a 40-week suspended sentence for abusing the girl, after his defence argued that his wife couldn't speak English and the household was dependent on him. But that decision will now be looked at again after dozens of people complained to the Attorney General's office. The Crown Prosecution Service could then send the case to the court of appeal to be reconsidered. The abuse took place over a nine-month period when Maknojioa, a respected Islamic scholar, was giving the victim and her two brothers Koran lessons at their home three times a week. Preston Crown Court heard that Maknojia repeatedly rubbed the girl's legs and reached under her headscarf to touch her chest as she recited the holy book. Her ordeal only came to light when her brothers, aged seven and 13, were overheard talking about it by their horrified mother who contacted the police. On the day he was arrested he was due to teach 30 children at a mosque near his home in Blackburn. He was subsequently found guilty of five counts of sexually touching a child and sentenced to 20 weeks jail. But a judge chose to suspend the sentence for two years after the court heard his family were dependent on him and he is ill with kidney problems. After the sentence was handed down on Monday friend of the victim's family immediately dubbed is a 'total disgrace’. ‘What type of message does this send out to paedophiles? He should be behind bars for this type of abuse. We are all horrified,' said the friend, who asked not to be named. Now a spokesman for the Attorney General's office has said that following an outpouring of complaints about Maknojia's sentence officials would look again at the decision. 'We received around 50 requests to review the sentence of Suleman Maknojioa,' the spokesman said. 'The CPS will look at the case and sentencing remarks of the judge and decide if it should be referred to the court of appeal.' Pervert:  Preston Crown Court heard that Maknojia over a nine-month period repeatedly rubbed an 11-year-old girl's legs and reached under her headscarf to touch her chest as he taught her and her brothers the Koran . The protests were spearheaded by the Muslim Women's Network UK who wrote a letter to the Attorney General expressing their outrage at the decision and calling for it to be reviewed. Shaista Gohir, chairman of the network, said she welcomed the decision. She said: 'Such unduly lenient sentences damage the public confidence. Victims of sexual abuse within the Muslim community find it very difficult to speak out, especially if the perpetrator is a religious teacher as they are held in such high esteem. 'What we often find what happens is that there is a tendency to blame the victim. This was the case in Blackburn and his lenient sentence fed into that. 'There needs to be stiffer sentences in cases of sexual abuse to send out a message that abuse will not be tolerated. 'Often the community can be part of the problem because we prioritise the honour of the community over the welfare of the victim. 'We need to be the first to speak out.'","Suleman Maknojioa was spared jail after court heard his family relied on him .

"A pensioner says he is a prisoner in his own home after a busy bus stop was placed at the end of his drive. Retired caretaker Ivor Souter, 66, came home one day to find the yellow bus stop markings outside his bungalow. Mr Souter, of Sheffield, South Yorkshire, says local services now regularly pull up in front of his driveway - every three minutes. Retired caretaker Ivor Souter came home from a hospital visit to find the entrance to his home had been turned into a bus stop . The markings take in the entire entrance to Mr Souter's bungalow, making him a prisoner in his own home . It also means the passenger pick-up point now sits squarely at front of Mr Souter's home. He said he was stunned to discover his local council had extended an existing bus stop to outside his drive. Mr Souter said: 'I go to the hospital, I come back, and they've done it. It's absolutely barmy. 'I've no idea why they've done it. There was no consultation. I can't get in and out of my drive. 'They've extended the bus stop right past my dropped kerb.

'We aim to strike a balance between making sure people can access safer, better buses with keeping all residents happy.' A spokesman for Sheffield's Passenger Transport Executive, the body responsible for maintaining bus stops in the city, said: 'There have been improvements to the bus stop but that has only been a tactile pavement for visually impaired passengers.

"Prince Charles has demanded urgent action to stop the annual ‘barbaric slaughter’ of half a million migrating songbirds at a British Army base in Cyprus. The creatures, familiar to millions of British gardens, often suffer for hours after being illegally snared in nets or on glue-coated sticks, before being killed and served up as a delicacy in Greek restaurants for £65 a plate. In a private letter seen by The Mail on Sunday, the Prince has taken the highly unusual step of writing to the most senior Army commander in Cyprus, as well as to the island’s president, condemning the ‘industrial scale killing’. Charles claims that it is big business, run by ‘serious organised criminals’. Prince Charles has demanded urgent action to stop the annual 'barbaric slaughter' of half a million migrating songbirds at a British Army base in Cyprus. The Prince has written to the most senior Army commander in Cyprus, as well as to the island's president, condemning the'industrial scale killing' The killing fields are centred on the British Sovereign Base Area (SBA) of Dhekelia, on Cyprus¿s southern coast, close to the tourist hot-spot of Ayia Napa. British soldiers train on firing ranges there before serving in Afghanistan . The killing fields are centred on the British Sovereign Base Area (SBA) of Dhekelia, on Cyprus’s southern coast, close to the tourist hot-spot of Ayia Napa. British soldiers train on firing ranges there before serving in Afghanistan. Trappers place their lures at night. Early the next morning, they return for their grisly harvest, ripping the terrified birds from the fine-mesh ‘mist’ nets or glue-covered branches, often leaving the entangled feet behind, then killing them with a cocktail stick or a penknife to the throat. Many will be used in the dish Ambelopoulia, in which the boiled or fried birds are eaten whole, save for the beak. Cypriots regards the meal as ‘natural viagra’. Trapping takes place during the autumn and spring migrations, and the illicit and sickening trade is worth £12  million a year. In his letter, Prince Charles writes: ‘Disturbingly, autumn mist-netting levels are now much higher on this British soil than in the Republic of Cyprus, with mist netting in the SBAs estimated to have increased 180 per cent since 2002.’ The trapping, made illegal in 1974, is sophisticated and large-scale. On land within the 50 square mile Dhekelia enclave, tenant farmers have planted acre upon acre of non-native acacia bushes to attract the passing birds as they look for insects. Birds like this Golden Oriole and many others familiar to millions of British gardens, often suffer for hours after being illegally snared in nets or on glue-coated sticks, before being killed and served up as a delicacy in Greek restaurants for £65 a plate . Trappers routinely lay their lures at night, returning the next morning for their grisly harvest, ripping the terrified birds from the fine nets or glue-covered branches, killing them with a cocktail stick through the neck or with a small penknife . In addition, loudspeakers are set up, powered by car batteries, broadcasting the mating call of the blackcap – the main target of the trappers – as a lure for the birds. The glue sticks, coated with a tacky lime solution, are placed in the tree branches, and vertical mist nets erected between the rows of acacia bushes which entangle not just the blackcaps, but all flying creatures, from robins to song thrushes and even small owls and other birds of prey. Charles calls for the acacia groves and their irrigation system to be ripped out. His letter to Major-General Richard Cripwell, Commander of British Forces in Cyprus, and copied to President Nicos Anastasiades, begins: ‘I am writing with regard to the industrial-scale killing of songbirds which is currently occurring on the Cyprus Sovereign Base Area of Dhekelia. ‘In particular, to ask you to have the infrastructure which permits this illegal slaughter (planted avenues of invasive acacia) to be removed from the MoD-administered land there by the start of the autumn migration period in September. ‘This would not only at a stroke save hundreds of thousands of birds being killed illegally on British soil, but would also prevent significant profits from flowing into the pockets of the serious organised criminals who control this barbaric practice.’ He says the bird haul includes ‘many species which are much-loved by the British public, such as robins, song thrushes and barn owls’. Martin Hellicar, Cyprus representative of Birdlife International, said: ‘An Army training ground has been turned over to wildlife crime. Can you  imagine that happening in Wiltshire?’ Conservationists say bird trapping has changed in the past 20 years from a small-scale activity intended to put food on the family table into a major criminal enterprise. A blackcap (warbler) caught on a limestick. The use of sticky latex 'birdlime', often obtained from a local tree, is used in many parts of the world to trap small birds. Prince Charles has allegedly claimed the practise in Cyprus and Greece is big business run by 'serious organised criminals' About 30 trappers, some of whom operate on Dhekelia, are believed to dominate the trade. Mafia figures with links to prostitution, drugs and gambling are suspected to be among their number. The effect on European bird populations is devastating. Favourite garden birds migrating between Britain and their African wintering quarters are among the estimated 1.5 million birds slaughtered  on Cyprus every year. Birdwatch International estimates that about 500,000 are killed on British bases. Royal Society for the Protection of Birds spokesman Grahame Madge welcomed the Prince’s intervention. He said: ‘It’s a staggering level of slaughter and we hope that it will provide a catalyst for change.’ According to RSPB figures, several species have drastically declined in the UK in the past two decades, and while the society did not claim illegal hunting was driving the decline, they cited it as an ‘additional pressure’. More than 150 different species have been recorded as killed in the nets, including globally endangered birds such as red-backed shrikes, barn owls and rollers. Viktoras Papadopoulos, spokesman for the Cyprus president, told The Mail on Sunday: ‘The president told Prince Charles we do everything we can within the law to enforce the law on trapping. We have the same concerns. He is respected in Cyprus and this will have an effect.’ Prince Charles has demanded urgent action to stop the 'barbaric slaughter' of millions of migrating songbirds . Arrested trappers are given fines of a few hundred euros, although one man was recently jailed for two months. Critics say the treatment of trappers fails to deter . Last week The Mail on Sunday went out on patrol with SBA police officers hunting the trappers. None were caught, but a net with dead birds was found, along with dozens of metal support poles and a loudspeaker wired to a car battery. SBA police Divisional Commander James Guy, a 66-year-old ex-Strathclyde officer, pointed out that restaurants in Cyprus are rarely prosecuted for serving bird dishes. ‘There are politicians who appear to have a very sympathetic attitude towards trappers,’ he said. One Cypriot political figure made light of the controversy, saying: ‘The birds are a delicacy. Catching them is traditional and you are hypocritical. It wasn’t long ago when English aristocrats used to hunt and kill foxes, and you can’t even eat them.’ Extracts from the Prince of Wales’s letter were obtained by The Mail on Sunday but Clarence House refused to comment on its contents. The Prince writes frequently to Government Ministers and his  letters have been at the centre of a controversial legal action. They have so far remained secret as the Attorney General Dominic Grieve has blocked a Freedom of Information request for disclosure of the letters. Earlier this month the veto was ruled unlawful by judges, but the letters remain under wraps awaiting an appeal to the Supreme Court.","Prince Charles has written to the most senior Army commander in Cyprus condemning the 'industrial scale killing' of migrating songbirds .

"Ben Cowburn made a least 43 attempts to take his own life after he was persuaded to do 'sexual things' with a gay TV star, an inquest heard . A gay TV comedian has hired expensive lawyers to keep his name secret after an inquest heard claims that he ‘groomed’ a teenager for sex just months before the youth killed himself. The comic was referred to only as ‘Mr X’ at the hearing into the death of Ben Cowburn, 18, which concluded yesterday with a jury returning an open verdict. Speculation over who the star is is rife on the internet, but in an effort to stop his identity becoming known he has instructed one of Britain’s top libel law firms, whose partners charge around £500 an hour for their services. His solicitors have threatened to take legal action against any newspaper that unmasks him, warning that he ‘will not hesitate to sue’. Ben’s family are understood to be upset that they were not consulted about the coroner’s decision to keep the comedian’s name secret through an informal agreement with the lawyers involved in the inquest. His mother Sharon, 52, said they had been ‘failed by the inquest process’ and suffered a ‘tragic injustice’ after an agonising wait of more than 1,000 days for the hearing to be held. The comedian is alleged to have given the teenager expensive gifts and taken him to drug-fuelled parties, leaving him feeling ‘dirty and used’. Ben met the celebrity after he moved away from his home in Cornwall, to study in London at the Fashion Retail Academy, founded by Topshop tycoon Sir Philip Green. The eight-day inquest heard allegations that the comedian climbed into bed beside Ben after a late-night party featuring drugs and alcohol, later engaging him in a sex act. At another gathering the teenager was allegedly persuaded to strip by a group of men and groped before another guest intervened and told them to stop. His twin sister Sophia, 21, said in a statement to the hearing: ‘We had concerns about him being groomed by Mr X.’ Ben was admitted to the Longreach mental health unit near Redruth, Cornwall, in October 2010 after several apparent suicide attempts. Two-and-a-half months later he was found dead in the early hours of the morning in the bathroom of his room at the hospital next to a plastic bag. Painful: Ben's mother Sharon spoke after the inquest and called her son's death a 'tragic injustice' The . teenager’s family hit out at staff at the NHS unit yesterday for . failing to act when he disclosed that he had been sexually abused while . he was studying in London. The inquest highlighted ‘shortcomings’ in . Ben’s care that contributed to him being able to kill himself, . including poor communication and the fact that nurses were stationed a . long way from his room. Speaking outside the hearing in Truro, Mrs . Cowburn condemned  failings in both the NHS’s treatment of her son and . the inquest process. Tears: Ben's sister Laura wept as their mother expressed how they felt the teenager had been badly let down . Flanked by her husband Steve, 51, and three . daughters, Sophia, Amber, 20, and Laura, 25, she said: ‘After an . agonising wait of over 1,000 days, this inquest has been bitterly . disappointing… . ‘Ben’s nursing care has been referred to as . inadequate, sub-standard and with systemic failures.  Most notably Ben . disclosed sexual abuse he had experienced in London to four members of . staff and no safeguarding alert was ever made by any one of those . staff.’ Ben, who reportedly attempted suicide 47 times, told police . that a TV celebrity had ‘done sexual things to him’, the inquest heard. The . teenager claimed that the celebrity, who was a fixture on TV and in . magazines, had bought him gifts and taken him to ‘nice places’, and sang . a rap song in which he said he had been ‘infiltrated’ by him. Ben said . he had not been raped or sexually assaulted, but added he agreed to the . sex acts ‘as he felt pressured to do the things’. Police investigated . the allegations that the teenager was sexually assaulted while living . in London but detectives decided there was ‘no conclusive evidence’. The . TV comedian has not been questioned, cautioned or arrested by police, . and was not asked to give evidence to the inquest. He refused to comment . last night. Dr Ellen Wilkinson, medical director of the Cornwall . Partnership NHS Foundation Trust, said: ‘The inquest was very thorough . and every aspect of Ben’s life has been examined including, quite . properly, the very short time he was a patient under our care.’ Ben's parents Steve and Sharon Cowburn arrive at the inquest in Truro, Cornwall. Ben made several suicide attempts after falling out with the star and was admitted to a mental health hospital, his inquest heard . Mother: Sharon Cowburn, mother of Ben Cowburn, speaks outside of the Epiphany House in Truro, Cornwall, after the result of her son's inquest was announced . After the inquest, the teenager's mother, Sharon Cowburn, read a statement on behalf of her family, including husband Steve and daughters Amber, Sophia and Laura. 'Today marks the end of a torturous eight days investigating the death of our dear son Ben,' Mrs Cowburn said. 'Three years ago our entire family was devastated by the tragic and untimely loss of Ben, who in his 18 years had achieved more success, style and popularity than many. 'After an agonising wait of over 1,000 days this inquest has been bitterly disappointing, from several key members of Ben's care team who were not available for inquest and to the frustrating regularity with which NHS staff were unable to recall key events. 'Ben's nursing care has been referred to as 'inadequate', 'sub-standard' and with 'systemic failures'. 'Most notably Ben disclosed sexual abuse which he had experienced in London to four members of staff and no safeguarding alert was ever made by those four members of staff. 'What we truly, truly hope is that the trust have made the changes that they have outlined. 'It should not have cost my son's life. It's far too a higher price to pay for the NHS to address these fundamental issues. 'We remain convinced that Ben was in an inappropriate environment and staff didn't understand his individual needs as an 18-year-old boy. 'As a family this will be forever in our hearts but we have made efforts to channel our energy into positive action by setting up the Invictus Trust and we are campaigning to set up a young people's mental health unit. 'We would like to extend our thanks to the local police who have treated Ben with care and support, to the local press who have consistently publicised the work of our charity, and to the jury who have considered and questioned during this complex case. 'Ben put his faith in the system so that he could recover and be safe. However, he didn't recover and he was not safe. 'We feel that Ben was thoroughly failed by the NHS foundation trust and our family has subsequently been failed by the inquest process.'

"The mother of one of the girls involved in a drinking game that left a nine-year-old in hospital has blamed Facebook for the shocking incident. She said the three girls, aged eight, nine and 11, stole drinks from her cabinet after watching videos of so-called Neknominate stunts  on Facebook. They then went to a shed where Rhiannon Scully downed a dangerous mix of vodka, whisky and orange juice. Nine-year-old Rhiannon Scully lies in a hospital bed after having her stomach pumped to clear it off a dangerous cocktail of vodka, whisky and orange juice which she had downed in a reckless Neknomination stunt . The woman, who is the mother of the 11-year-old girl and gave her name only as Mrs Leader, called for Facebook to ban videos of Neknominations. Three people have died taking part in the drinking craze. ‘The NekNomination videos should be banned to protect the children,' she said. ‘It is not appropriate for Facebook to have these videos on the site when children can access them, especially if people have died as a result. I think it is ridiculous. ‘In reality children as young as eight are on Facebook and they can see these videos which inspire them. Facebook should stop allowing them from being shared. As a parent it does worry us that they can see these things so easily. ‘While I try and monitor my daughter’s Facebook I can only delete things my daughter writes, not what she sees.’ She said she allowed her daughter on Facebook, where users should be at least 13, to keep in touch with friends after moving to County Durham from Portsmouth. Mrs Leader said she was at work when police called to say a girl had been taken to hospital after drinking. Rhiannon had to have her stomach pumped as a result. Her mother, Michelle, 32, found her daughter riding home ‘all over the place’ with ‘eyes rolling into the back of her head’ on her electric scooter and still in her school uniform. Mrs Scully, who then phoned an ambulance, claimed her daughter had been dared to down the drink after the girls had been watching NekNomination videos on Facebook. She said the act was filmed on a mobile phone and deleted soon after – but the families of the other two girls involved claimed they had no knowledge of this. Police confirmed they questioned both Rhiannon’s family and her friends’ families about the incident but decided no action was required. Mrs Leader, who has three children, two aged 17 and 14, said: ‘I had a phone call at work from the police saying my daughter and two friends were drinking and as a result one was sent to hospital. ‘They said it could be due to a NekNomination and asked if I knew what one was. ‘No one was in at the time, I was at work, and I was told the three girls had come into the house and taken a bottle of vodka from a globe in the house that opens. Rhiannon's mother, Michelle, 32, found her riding home 'all over the place' on her electric scooter, with 'eyes rolling into the back of her head' ‘They had been playing at one of the girls’ houses down the road and then came to house. They took three plastic tumblers into the garden shed and that is apparently when Rhiannon drank the mixture. ‘The other two didn’t want to drink it, my daughter has never drank in her life.’ She said she had been left totally ‘shocked’ by the incident as herself and her husband, a coach driver, rarely drank. She said: ‘I’m not a drinker myself, and as for my daughter, she’s a normal 11-year-old girl, she hasn’t touched the stuff. She’s a good girl who comes home from school and does her homework or plays round at her friends’ houses. She is a normal 11-year-old girl. ‘We told her how terrible it was what happened and she knows it is wrong to drink and we were really worried. ‘She has Facebook and I go through it to check it as I’m aware how young she is. We moved from Portsmouth and she wanted to be in contact with her friends on Facebook while we were here. ‘In theory she shouldn’t be on it but all her friends are and if she wasn’t she would be looking at her sister's.’ Her grandmother, Diane Leader, 60, called for Facebook to stop fuelling the NekNominate craze – a drinking game in which people post videos of themselves on the site drinking dangerous and bizarre concoctions of alcohol then dare their friends to outdo them. She said: ‘It is absolutely shocking. I don’t agree with the craze or Facebook allowing them to be posted at all. It should be banned, it worries me that children younger than nine can be on there looking at these things. ‘They start playing games that mum and dad might play on the internet and then they just have to glance at something on Facebook and they get these ideas.’ Chief Supt Ivan Wood, in charge of neighbourhood policing across the entire Durham Police force area, said: ‘This case brings into sharp focus the rise of the influence of the Internet and the emergence of NekNominate in particular. ‘There is no control over the social media and the young people who get access to it even when they should not. ‘They see older teenagers doing it, and now even young children are doing it, they just copy their behaviour. There is so much risk around it, and I think this is what happened here.’ A Facebook spokesman said: 'Facebook's rules are clear, you have to be 13 to use our service. 'We ask that people follow our rules and provide simple reporting links all over Facebook so that people can report things to us, including under 13s. Once underage profiles are reported to us, they are quickly removed.'","'I can't monitor what my daughter sees on Facebook,' complains mother .

"A TV show about the excavation of Second World War graves has been cancelled after a barrage of criticism about its approach from archaeologists, one of whom labelled it a ‘disgrace’. Nazi War Diggers was due to air on May 13, but National Geographic Channel said it has removed it from its schedules ‘indefinitely’ while it reviews how the programme was made. Episodes of programme would have seen two . metal-detecting specialists, a Polish relic hunter and an American . military antiquities dealer 'hunt down stories of war and uncover . relics' from 'remote forests and fields of Eastern Europe'. Controversial: The show features four war diggers excavating Second World War relics in East Europe . But archaeologists were inflamed after a . gruesome preview video appeared on the channel’s website, which showed . the presenters extracting various body parts from a muddy grave in . Latvia. At one point, the men mistake a leg bone for an arm bone after . wrenching it from the ground. Dr Tony Pollard, the Director of the Centre for Battlefield Archaeology at Glasgow University, labelled the show a ‘disgrace’. He said: ‘I’m appalled that a major broadcaster has sunk to the levels of exploitation television. I’ve been at the forefront of battlefield archaeology for fifteen years, and I have spent much time getting the subject taken seriously. Anger: Archaeologists were inflamed after a gruesome preview video appeared on the channel¿s website, which showed the presenters extracting various body parts from a muddy grave in Latvia . 'This just looks like they’ve gone around digging up bodies, because TV likes a dead body.’ Dr Pollard regarded the way in which the programme’s presenters handled human remains as being particularly insensitive. He added: ‘This shows no evidence of even the most basic archaeological principles - this is treasure hunting not archaeology. 'I have seen human remains brandished like trophies before but in dodgy youtube videos. The fact that this comes from a commissioned TV series is quite beyond belief. ‘The trailer on the internet was absolutely shocking, and very damaging for National Geographic.’ Dozens of archaeologists have left comments on the National Geographic website, lambasting the channel for what they see as a grotesquely insensitive intrusion into a gravesite. Barrage: Dozens of archaeologists left comments on the National Geographic website criticising the show . ‘You are sensationalizing and promoting the looting of archaeological sites and the disrespect of human remains,’ wrote Shannon Boomgarden of the Natural History Museum of Utah. ‘You should be ashamed to profit off these destructive activities disguised as “science”.’ Dr Sam Hardy of University College, London, who specialises in research into the illegal antiquities trade, is incensed at what he has seen. ‘Based on the preview video, the Nazi War Diggers didn’t record their finds properly,’ he said. ‘They didn’t take out the material carefully. To me, it looks untrained and unsupervised. If I tried to excavate a skeleton like that on a dig I would have been stopped and thrown off the site. It’s slapdash and it destroys evidence.’ Scrapped: National Geographic Channel said it will pull Nazi War Diggers from its schedule indefinitely . At first National Geographic tried to defend the programme saying ‘the series operates in direct conjunction with organizations officially licensed to excavate battlefields’. But now it’s pulled the plug, saying in a statement: ‘National Geographic Channels International, in consultation with colleagues at the National Geographic Society, announced today that it will pull the series Nazi War Diggers from its schedule indefinitely while questions raised in recent days regarding allegations about the program can be properly reviewed. ‘While we support the goal of the series, which is to tell the stories of long lost and forgotten soldiers, those left behind and still unaccounted for, and illuminate history working in concert with local governments and authorities, we also take seriously the questions that have been asked.’ The programme had been commissioned by the satellite channel from the same company that made Sex Box - the controversial feature aired on Channel 4 in October where couples had sex in a sound-proofed box before being interviewed about the experience in front of an audience.","Nazi War Diggers was due to air on National Geographic on May 13 .

"Police missed their chance to stop the teenage couple suspected of shooting dead a Florida police officer as Brandon Goode and Alexandria Hollinghurst dramatically escaped arrest just 24 hours before their bloody end, MailOnline can reveal. British born Alex, 17 and her 18-year-old boyfriend Goode sped recklessly from a Walgreen parking lot in Kissimmee, Florida, nearly plowing into Corporal Edward Martinez who had approached their vehicle with his gun drawn. In a police report, seen by MailOnline, Corp Martinez recounted the dramatic episode that took place the morning before the teenagers gunned down the next cop they encountered. Scroll down for video . 'Suicide': Police approached Brandon Goode, left, and his . girlfriend, Alex . Hollinghurst, right, after they identified the car they were driving. However, the teen couple sped away - almost hitting an officer who had drawn his gun . Tragedy: Alex Hollinghurst died early Saturday - but police could have had an opportunity to stop her and Goode when they encountered them at a Walgreens pharmacy in Florida 24-hours before they allegedly died . Officer Robert German was gunned down in Windermere, Florida on Saturday evening– just one hour’s drive from the site in Kissimmee where the couple came close to capture. At 10.02am on Friday 21 March Officer Martinez spotted the couple’s car in the pharmacy parking lot. Polk County police had issued an alert deeming Goode and Hollinghurst ‘missing endangered,’ following the discovery of suicide notes left they had written. Gunned down: Officer Robert German called for backup and was found fatally injured in the road . According to Officer Martinez: ‘I was on duty driving a marked police car…I was wearing a police uniform complete with all insignia and a badge identifying me as a police officer. It was a bright, sunny day and there was no confusing I was a police officer.’ He approached the car with his service weapon ‘drawn low and ready.’ Goode initially told the officer that he and Alex were ‘in town trying to sell jewelry for much needed cash’ before admitting his true identity and that he was from Davenport. Corp Martinez motioned to his partner, waiting in their car, and beckoned him to come and take Hollinghurst out of the car while he moved round to apprehend Goode. But he stated, ‘Goode reached for the ignition started the vehicle and placed it in drive. ‘I was standing just to the rear of the driver side door,’ he wrote. ‘And began to reach for Goode before he could place the vehicle in drive but realized I still had my department issued firearm in my hand.’ In a moment that could have changed the course of events which have left three people dead, Martinez recorded: ‘I jumped back as the vehicle lurched forward nearly striking me.’ Goode then drove ‘eratically’ out of the parking lot, swerving violently before righting the car and speeding off. Roped off: Officers cordoned off the area where the shootings are said to have taken place . Scene: A medical examiner's van can be seen in the neighborhood following the shootings on Saturday . Scene: A body is taken away in a medical examiner's van following the shootings on Saturday . In the police report later filed Goode and Hollinghurst are charged with resisting arrest without violence and Goode with reckless driving. This comes as it was announced that the British teenager suspected of shooting dead a Florida police officer had recently been thrown out of her home by her parents after rows over her boyfriend and her arrest on drug offenses. Alexandria Hollinghurst and her boyfriend Brandon Goode gunned down a police officer in a wealthy suburb of Orlando on Saturday before apparently taking their own lives. Authorities said the teenagers had both left behind suicide notes. The tragedy came after Hollinghurst, who was born in the north of England, moved in with Goode after her parents Matthew and Debra objected to his 'druggie' lifestyle. Police records also reveal he had threatened his mother with an axe when he was just 16. Last month, she was arrested with him after they were found to be in possession of marijuana but as she is a juvenile, details of her court appearance are not for public record. Her name was redacted from the arrest report, but a police source confirmed she was the 17-year-old girl who was arrested with Goode on February 24th was Hollinghurst. Mystery: Police say they found a male and female, both white and in their early 20s, dead in brush on the property of this home - they are believed to have committed suicide . It was this incident that led to Hollinghurst moving out of her parent's home in Davenport, Florida. 'Matthew and Debra tried to stop Alex from seeing this guy and they just kept on rowing,' said a friend. 'The arrest last month was the final straw for them, and she moved out after rowing all the time. She was coming home at all hours.' Friends of Hollinghurst said her parents, who emigrated from Manchester in 2011, disapproved of Goode who was previously arrested for aggravated assault when he threatened his mum with an axe. In the 2012 incident, he had painted his face black, covered the windows of his home, armed himself with an axe and when his mother returned home, he demanded she accept his father's divorce settlement, the Orlando Sentinel reported. 'Alex had moved into Brandon's home because her parents threw her out,' said a friend who attended the same high school as the teenagers. They did not like Brandon because he was involved in drugs and made no secret that he liked to smoke weed.' Neighbors of Goode, who lived with his divorced mum Connie, confirmed that they often saw blonde Alex at the home. 'She was here all the time, and a cute girl,' said neighbor George Koop. 'They would go out together in his car, often coming back late at night.' Devastated: Hollinghurst's younger sister's Facebook profile is filled with images of the two girls smiling and making silly faces . Cut short: Hollinghurst had a seemingly bright future, she graduated high school an entire year early . On Monday, it emerged that the teenagers had been reported as being 'missing endangered' after two separate notes were found by their families. As police only recovered one weapon it would seem the teenagers took it in turns to shoot themselves as part of a suicide pact. Their bodies were found 100 yards from where officer Robert German was gunned down. They apparently shot him after he stopped them during a routine foot patrol through the neighborhood. A police spokesman for the Orange County Sheriff's Office said: 'The OSCO has been given suicide notes written by both individuals. The contents of those notes will not be revealed at this time, as the investigation is active and open. 'During the course of this homicide investigation, the OSCO investigations learned from Polk County authorities, that the suspects were considered missing endangered due to the suicidal notes. 'That information was entered by Polk County into the system.' Popular: Hollinghurst's Facebook is also chock full of pictures of her with friends . The discovery of the notes led to speculation that the pair had been considering 'suicide by cop' and set out to provoke the officer into opening fire on them. It is not known why they shot German before he had a chance to use his service revolver or why they did not wait for other officers to arrive before taking their own lives. German had called for back-up telling his radio dispatchers to say he was stopping the pair for suspicious activity. But when a patrol car arrived they found German shot in the head. The officers then heard two gunshots and the bodies of Goode and Hollinghurst were found in bushes about 100 yards away. The slain officer was wearing a body camera at the time and the footage will be reviewed as part of the investigation into the incident. Hollinghurst originally came from Oldham in Greater Manchester, England and her family had emigrated to the U.S. about six years ago. Former neighbors have spoken of their shock.

"Rants about the Sandy Hook shooting and feelings of anger after a recent robbery and tour of duty in Iraq were posted on Facebook by Fort Hood gunman Ivan Lopez. Details of his social media accounts were revealed as investigators try to piece together what caused the 34-year-old Iraq War veteran to shot dead three soldiers on the Texas army base on Wednesday. The Iraq War veteran was being evaluated for post-traumatic stress disorder, and his posts appear to show he was struggling to deal with his feelings of anger and anxiety. Scroll down for video . Gunman: Army Spc. Ivan Lopez killed three people and wounded 16 others in a shooting at Fort Hood on Wednesday before killing himself. It followed a verbal altercation at a personnel office . It is not yet clear what drove Lopez to kill three people and injure 16 others before taking his own life this week, but he had a history of depression. Posts about his feelings were made on a Facebook account that a family member has confirmed did belong to the gunman. In one, written last month around the time he bought the pistol used in the attack, he said he was 'Full of hate' after being robbed. The post, seen by CNN, stated: 'My spiritual peace has just gone. Full of . hate. Now I think I'll be damned.' In another post he ranted about Sandy Hook gunman Adam Lanza, condemning the 20-year-old who killed 20 children and six teachers, for wanting a 'minute of fame as a villain'. He added: 'It is stupid to me that anyone can . have easy access to a powerful weapon without being mentally evaluated. This makes the government indirect accomplice.' Another post on his Facebook revealed feelings of fear from his time in Iraq, where he claimed to have seen 'the most brutal explosion'. It read: 'Hours of agony waiting for an attack by the insurgency but . we were able to exit Fallujah all alive. I was in vehicle #6.The worst . was that #5 was a diesel truck, the perfect target. And I was only . thinking about getting back with my family.' Protection: Sgt 1st Class Daniel Michael Ferguson was killed as he tried to barricade a door to protect others . Loss: Sgt Timothy Wayne Owens, left, and Staff Sgt Carlos Alberto Lazaney Rodriguez died in the attack . Lieutenant General Mark Milley however said Lopez did not experience direct combat during his time in Iraq. 'We have not discovered any specific traumatic event, wounds . received in action, contact with the enemy or anything else specific . that he may have been exposed to while deployed,' he told CNN. Chris Grey, spokesman for the army's investigation, has not yet commented on the Facebook posts. He said: 'Given that the alleged shooter is . deceased, the possibility does exist that we may never know exactly why . the alleged shooter did what he did.' Lopez was said to have possibly been upset about attempts to get leave from his job, and he was seen having an argument with three soldiers shortly before the attack. The gunman's father, who is also called Ivan Lopez, described his son on Friday as a 'calm family man' and said he may have been affected by the death of his mother at the end of last year. 'My son could not have been in his right mind. He was not like this,' he said. 'Motive': Theodis Westbrook said his son, who was shot, said Lopez had tried to pick up a leave form but was told to return another time. He left, grabbed and gun and then opened fire in the office . Recovering: His son Jonathan Westbrook was shot four times in Wednesday's deadly incident . The father of Army Sgt. Jonathan . Westbrook, who works in the personnel office at the base and who was hit . by four bullets, said that the violent rampage was sparked by a verbal . altercation in the office. He said his son said that the gunman had gone to collect a leave form . but was told to return the next day. He then left, returned with a gun . and opened fire, Theodis Westbrook told WLBT. 'The . first guy he shot right in front of my son was killed, and then he . turned the gun towards Jonathan, aimed it and fired,' he said. 'I don’t . know how many times he fired, but he hit my son four times.' The . military has released few details about what motivated the shooting . rampage, but at a press conference on Friday, the Fort Hood commander . said they believe an argument was a 'direct precipitating factor' before . the shooting. The three . people killed in a shooting rampage were all male soldiers in their 30s. A memorial is being held for the murdered and injured soldiers next . Wednesday. Among . the victims was Army Sergeant Timothy Owens, 37, a recently married . native of Effingham, Illinois, who was shot in the chest at close range, . his mother-in-law told the Chicago Sun-Times. Gunned down: U.S. Army Sgt. Tim Owens, left, from Effingham, Illinois was shot dead in the rampage on Wednesday. 38-year-old Carlos Lazaney, right, from Aguadilla, Puerto Rico was also killed . Life cut short: Sgt. First Class Danny Ferguson, pictured right with his fiancée, had just returned from Afghanistan when 34-year-old Ivan Lopez opened fire on Wednesday, killing him . The 37-year-old, who joined the Army in 2004 and served in Iraq and Kuwait, had been awarded three Commendation Medals, four Army Achievement Medals, a Combat Action Badge, and Global War on Terrorism Medal, among others. Sgt First Class Danny Ferguson, 39, from Florida, had just returned from . Afghanistan and died while trying to barricade a door to keep the . shooter away, his fiancée and fellow soldier Kristen Haley told Tampa . broadcaster WTSP-TV. She was nearby when the shooting started. 'He . held that door shut because it wouldn't lock. It seems the doors would . be bullet proof, but apparently they're not,' Haley told News 10. 'If he . wasn't the one standing there holding those doors closed, that shooter . would have been able to get through and shoot everyone else.' As well as serving in Afghanistan, Sgt Ferguson had three tours in Kuwait and one in Iraq, and had been awarded several medals, including a Bronze Star, a Kosovo Campaign Medal with Bronze Service Star, and Afghanistan Campaign Medal with campaign star, and an Iraq Campaign Medal with campaign star. The third fatality was Staff Sgt Carlos Lazaney, of Aguadilla, Puerto Rico. The 38-year-old had served two tours in Iraq and one in Kuwait, and had been awarded four Commendation Medals, three Army Achievement Medals, the Iraq Campaign Medal with Two Stars, among others. Recovering: One of the wounded was identified as Maj. Patrick Miller, pictured, a 32-year-old Iraq War veteran from western New York, the state's Governor Andrew Cuomo said Thursday . There was a strong possibility a . verbal altercation with another soldier or soldiers preceded the . shooting, Lieutenant General Mark Milley told reporters on Thursday, . adding there was no indication that he targeted specific people. The Lopez family, who live in Guayanilla, Puerto Rico, said in a statement they were 'dismayed' by the tragic events. 'This is a very painful situation,' the father of Ivan Lopez said in the statement. 'I ask for prayers for the affected families.' The rampage is the third shooting at a military base in the United States in about six months that, along with a series of shootings in public places, such as schools and malls, has intensified a national debate over gun violence. Remembered: Crosses representing the victims of the shooting at Fort Hood military base are displayed outside Central Christian Church in Killeen, Texas on Thursday . It has also raised questions about . security at U.S. military installations, such as Fort Hood, home to some . 45,000 soldiers and airmen assigned to the 335-square-mile . (870-square-km) base, along with thousands of civilian employees. 'Obviously we have a gap. Anytime we . lose an individual, something's gone wrong,' U.S. Defense Secretary . Chuck Hagel told reporters in Hawaii on Thursday. Military officials have so far ruled out terrorism as the reason for the attack. Lopez had been treated for depression and anxiety. He was being evaluated to see if he suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder, or PTSD, military officials said. The shooting sent shockwaves through the Central Texas community in Killeen, where the base is located, that is still reeling from a 2009 attack in which a former Army psychiatrist, Major Nidal Hasan, shot dead 13 people and wounded 32 others. Shooter: Ivan Lopez, seen in this undated photo, has been identified as the soldier who opened fire on Fort Hood army base on Wednesday killing three and injuring 16 others before turning the gun on himself . Lopez, originally from Puerto Rico, had . recently bought the gun he used, a Smith & Wesson .45-caliber . pistol, at Guns Galore, the same store in Killeen where Hasan purchased . the weapon he used in his shooting spree. All of the wounded shooting victims were showing signs of improvement, Scott & White Memorial Hospital in Temple said. Five soldiers are still in hospital. 'The three patients previously listed in critical condition have been upgraded to fair condition and are expected to remain in the hospital for the next several days,' it said in a statement on Friday. Five patients have been discharged, with one patient staying on through Friday for tests. See below for video .

"More disturbing details have emerged telling of former dictator Muammar Gaddafi’s iron-fisted rule over Libya. The despot kept the severed head of one of his enemies in a freezer for 25 years and built a secret sex dungeon on the campus of a college specifically to rape coeds, according to a new documentary on his brutal regime. He also stored the bodies of other rivals he had killed and would visit them occasionally at a walk-in freezer. The sex chamber was built on the campus of Tripoli University. Dictator: Former Libyan leader Col. Muammar Gaddafi gestures as he enters the U.N. headquarters in 2009 for the United Nations General Assembly . The barbaric horrors are revealed in British filmmaker Christopher Olgiati’s new documentary called ‘Mad Dog: Inside the Secret World of Muammar Gaddafi.’ The film includes an interview with a renegade CIA operative Frank Terpil who ran a ‘murder for hire’ team used by Ghaddafi. The dictator dubbed it ‘Murder Incorporated.’ Terpil says in the film he was given $1m to kill one of the dictator's rivals and deliver his head back to Libya. Terpil claims Ghaddafi, who was killed by rebels two years ago after his regime was overthrown, kept the head in a freezer along with the bodies of other victims he had murdered. ‘I was in Geneva… [a Ghadaffi relative] opened up a letter of credit for a million dollars for [the target's] demise, on the caveat that his head be delivered back in a cooler to Libya so Gaddafi could actually look at the results of the work,’ he says in the biopic, according to the Post. Safer now: Libyan students at the University of Tripoli, formerly Al-Fateh University, gather for an open day at the Engineering Department on October 9, 2011 -- the school not long ago housed a rape dungeon run by Gaddafi, according to a new documentary . Terpil fled to Cuba after being sentenced to 53 years in prison for illegal arms deals, according to the New York Post. A separate source claims the depraved dictator would often visit the frozen bodies of his enemies, sometimes as much as 25 years later.’ The documentary team also found evidence of the depraved dictator's secret sex den at Tripoli University he had built to rape students after giving speeches on the campus. ‘The untouched room contains a bed, Jacuzzi and area where the women were checked for STDs, with surgical instruments, rubber masks and anaesthesia,’ Olgiati told the Post. ‘[Gaddafi] was utterly charming, utterly ruthless and stupendously rich,’ Olgiati continued. ‘He was driven solely by his lust for power.’ ‘Mad Dog’ will air Friday on Showtime.","Gaddafi ordered the hit men to decapitate one of his victims to prove he was killed .

While the would-be criminal did not get away with the jewellery, he did break the fragile gold chain in his attempt before fleeing across the road into oncoming traffic. Scroll down for video . An attempted mugging was caught on camera after a thief tried to steal this woman's necklace during an interview about high crime rate in the area . The woman, whose name is not given, was being interviewed at the time by RJTV . The interviewer, working for RJTV, attempts to chase the failed thief down, but the petty criminal is too fast for him. Rio is a city known worldwide for its high crime rate, especially in the nearly-1,000 favelas outside the main city where gang and drug-related crime is rife. In August alone last year there were 406 killings in the city and surrounding state, an increase of 40 per cent on the year before. There were also 629 robberies on public transport just in August , while muggings soared by nearly 40 per cent as well. While she is speaking a hand reaches in and tries to grab the gold necklace but only succeeds in breaking it . The interviewer gives chase, but the petty criminal is too fast and escapes by running into oncoming traffic . The video will serve as yet another warning to any football fans travelling to the city this summer for the World Cup to be on their guard. Recently armed soldiers backed up by helicopters and armoured vehicles stormed one of Brazil's largest favelas, Complexo da Mare, in what was thought to be an attempted clean-up ahead of the sporting competition. Roughly 1,400 soldiers and police officers patrolled the streets in a show of force last month in an attempt to bring gang violence in the impoverished area down.","Woman being interviewed in Brazilian city of Rio de Janeiro .

"Liz Hurley has become embroiled in fresh controversy over her range of children’s bikinis – with critics branding them unsuitable for young girls. The actress was bombarded with angry comments after she used Twitter to advertise her controversial collection, which includes skimpy designs aimed at under-eights. The model, who was accused of sexualising young girls after initially unveiling the skimpy, two-piece designs two years ago, faced a backlash from her followers who insisted ‘kids should look like kids’. Liz Hurley has become embroiled in fresh controversy over her range of children's bikinis - with critics branding them unsuitable for young girls . The 49-year-old used her personal Twitter account to ask her 450,000 followers: ‘Going somewhere hot at Easter? Check out our Swim Collection.’ She then added: ‘Our Kids collection is divine too.’ Miss Hurley then added a picture of the kids bikinis on display in Harrods, before uploading a link to her website where the items are sold. However, one follower, Lee-Anne Compton wrote back: ‘I’m all for kids looking fab, but looking like kids and safe in the sun.’ EM Grant then posted the message: ‘KIDS? Leopard Print bikinis on KIDS!?’ Julia Hall then wrote in disbelief: ‘What ages are the kids!?’ The model, who was accused of sexualising young girls after initially unveiling the skimpy, two-piece designs two years ago, faced a backlash from her followers who insisted 'kids should look like kids' The actress’s website features several children wearing the skimpy designs while striking poses more suitable for adult models. It includes items for the under eights, such as an animal-print ‘Mini Cha Cha Bikini’ which costs £32.90 and is modelled by a blonde child with both hands placed precociously on her hips. Another design, called the ‘Collette Bikini’ is advertised in the 8-13 age range, and is described as being ‘great for girls who want to look grown up’. Campaigners have previously hit out at Miss Hurley’s bikini collection, calling them ‘disturbing’. Dr Katherine Rake, chief executive of the Family and Parenting Institute charity, said the designs put pressure on parents by attracting young girls to the notion of growing up too fast. She says: ‘Parents have been telling us for a long time that they want their children to be able to enjoy childhood. We’d like young girls to be encouraged to emulate Olympic stars like Ellie Simmonds and Rebecca Adlington when in the swimming pool - not models in leopard print.’ In a report in 2011, Reg Bailey, chief executive of the Mothers’ Union, set out a series of guidelines to be met in order to prevent the sexualisation of young children. One of the recommendations was for ‘retailers to offer more age-appropriate clothes for children and sign up to a code of practice which checks and challenges the design, buying display and marketing of clothes, products and services for children’. A spokesman for Miss Hurley has previously defended the designs saying they are hugely popular with parents and children. It was last year that Gwyneth Paltrow was also accused of sexualising children after endorsing a range of bikinis for girls as young as four, and which she was selling through her lifestyle website, GOOP. The website says the design is perfect for little girls who want to match their mothers, as the top is an exact copy of the adult version - also sold on the website.","Two years after she was accused of sexualising children with designs .

"It was the difference between life and horrific certain death - a decision to use urine from latrine bucket as part of an escape plan, which helped save Leo Bretholz’s life. Bretholz was one of many on a guarded train packed with Jews, which left Paris and for Auschwitz on November 5, 1943. With the latrine overflowing and located in the middle of the floor on the railway cattle wagon headed for the death camp in Nazi occupied Poland, Bretholz used its contents to help him jump from the train, the Independent reported. He was one of at least 764 people who escaped the Holocaust by leaping from trains, a surprising  figure drawn from new research. Jews wearing the star emblem, arrive in Auschwitz, in German-occupied Poland in June 1944 . A freight car, used used to transport Jews, gypsies and other political prisoners to concentration camps, where many were killed . Bretholz, then 21, and friend Manfred Silberstein tried desperately for hours to force apart iron bars a small window in the side of the wagon in the hope they would pass out of them. Despite their best efforts using pullovers as ropes, the bars refused to give. Another person on the train proposed they soak the makeshift ropes in urine, as it could strengthen their grip on the bars. Desperate to escape, Bretholz said he put aside feelings of sickness and nausea in the next steps he took. 'I bent down and soaked my pullover in urine. There were bits of excrement floating in it. I felt humiliated. It was the most disgusting thing I had ever done,' he said. With the fellow passanger's advice working, Bretholz and his friend successfully pulled the bars far enough apart for them to squeeze their way out. But their battle for survival was far from over once they were on the outside the edge of the wagon, with the two young men trying to avoid the guards' searchlights. It was not until the train passed a corner that the pair used a concave shadow to hide them as they jumped. Getting a second chance at life, the two miraculously survived the escape and risky jump, with  Bretholz spending the rest of World War II evading the Nazis. Escape: Leo Bretholz, who died last week at 93 . Aged 93, Bretholz died in the US a week ago, coinciding with new historical research published in Germany. The work tells the unheard stories of about those who cheated death by jumping from Nazi trains leaving from France, Belgium and Holland for death camps. Historian Tanja von Fransecky spent four years interviewing people and researching archives in Europe and Israel for her study Jewish Escapes from Deportation Trains. She said was shocked at the number who survived the Holocaust by jumping trains. 'I was amazed that this happened at all. I had always assumed that the wagons were stuffed full prior to departure and simply opened on arrival and that not much could happen in between,' she said. During her research, the author found this was not the case, with desperate attempts by passengers trying to break free from the Nazi trains with the aid of smuggled tools in some cases, or by people improvising, such as  Bretholz with the urine-drenched pullovers. But would-be escapees often faced anger from fellow passengers, who feared for their own lives if others successfully got away. Their concerns were on the back of threats that everyone would be shot if someone escape and fears over who would care for children, the old and the sick. This placed the escapees in a deep moral dilemma, torn between leaving someone behind and fighting to live, Dr von Fransecky said. For this reason, the author said many survivors kept silent in the years following the war, including Simon Gronowski, 82, kept quite about his jump to freedom for almost 60 years. At just 11 years old, Gronowski was held in a Nazi transit camp near Antwerp, Belgium. With his father escaping the Gestapo, Nazi Germany's feared secret police force, the young boy hoped to rejoin his dad. Prisoners arriving at the Auschwitz concentration camp in 1945. In the background chimneys of the crematory can be seen, used to burn the bodies of the murdered prisoners. It is believed 2.5 and 4 million people, mostly Jews, were killed here by the Nazi regime until the end of World War II in 1945 . Death camp: The snow-covered train tracks lead to the gas chambers of the Auschwitz concentration camp. The Nazi's had the concentration camp established in 1940 and enlarged to an extermination camp in 1941 . After hearing about people leaping off trains, he used his bunk bed in the Nazi camp to practice jumping in preparation for his own escape. In March 1943, Gronowski and his mother were among those packed onto a cattle wagon with Auschwitz awaiting them at the end of their journey. Getting his chance to beat death, the young boy was encouraged by  a group of resistance fighter's raid, which freed 17 Jews from the train. A group of men in Gronowski’s wagon were able to force open the door, but with the train building speed, the young boy paused while hesitating. Taking the jump off the train, his mother’s last words to him were that the train was going too fast. While he survived, his mother was murder in Auschwitz shortly after. Willy Berler was 25 when he was imprisoned aboard an Auschwitz transport travelling through Belgium - but he did not jump. Part of a group of six young male prisoners, they broke open a cattle wagon window, which enabled them to escape one by one. Watching anxiously as the person before him climbed through the window, Berler was next, but as he pulled himself through, was confronted with a 'horrible sight'. 'The boy was caught between two wagons and his head had been crushed between the buffers like a melon.' Berler said in hindsight, if he knew what awaited him in Auschwitz, he would have jumped, but unlike thousands of others, he survived the camp. Simon Gronowski lost his sister in Auschwitz and only resolved his traumatic experiences in 2002, when he had a reunion with the armed guard who forced him and his family on to the death camp train in 1943. In the meeting, the guard begged him for forgiveness, with the two men weeping as they fell into each others’ arms. 'My life has been full of miracles,' Mr Gronowski now likes to say. Red Cross workers care for 2,500 Jewish slave laborers who were being transported by train to camps behind Nazi lines when freed by rapidly advancing US Ninth Army infantrymen. Many prisoners died during the rail ride from malnutrition and lack of medical attention .","Around 764 Jews jumped from Nazi trains, according to new research .

"A road safety row has erupted as the Government prepares to turn the M25 hard shoulder into the country’s first controversial permanent traffic lane from next week. The Highways Agency says the big switch-on will ease congestion on Britain’s busiest motorway – the M25. But motoring groups say it will put motorists at ‘added risk’. They say the distances between new safety ‘refuges’ are too far apart and there are too few overhead gantries for variable signs. The new lane system is an attempt to push the roads into a more hi-tech world, with changeable signs and 'refuge points' instead of hard shoulders . Lanes will be controlled  by cameras, variable signs and sensors in a bid to ease the gridlock – and the idea is to be rolled out to other motorways across the UK. Inevitably, a new generation of hi-tech speed cameras – understood to be capable of capturing speeding cars across multiple lanes -  will police the variable speed limits. But the AA voiced ‘significant road safety reservations’  and caution fearing that permanent removal of the hard shoulder could increase road safety risks because breakdowns and other emergencies will have to take place in a live traffic lane. It said the space between refuges – every 1.5 miles – was too great and should be around every 800 yards. And RAC technical director David Bizley said: ‘We have raised concerns with the Highways Agency about the added risk arising from increased distance between emergency refuge areas, and we are disappointed so far at the absence of action to address them."" The sombre caution is in sharp contrast to the upbeat message from the Government’s Highways Agency crowing that the switch means the M25 will become ‘the smartest’ motorway in the country. Around 20 miles (32km) of the M25 will feature this hard-shoulder running, which has been trialled, but only at certain times, on various motorways, starting with a section of the M42 in the West Midlands in 2006. Until now the lanes have had a hard shoulder to allow for traffic to flow even if there is an accident, or for people to take refuge when their car breaks down, but now they are being abolished . From Monday, the hard shoulder between junctions 23 and 25 on the M25 in Hertfordshire will be available for use by vehicles. Then next month the hard shoulder will be available for traffic between junctions 5 and 6/7 of the motorway on the Kent/Surrey border. Highways Agency senior project manager John Martin said: ‘Around £1.7billion is being invested into roads in south east England by 2021 with 145 new lane miles (233km) of capacity added. ‘Soon the smart motorway will be complete and we are now asking drivers to get smart and find out more about how to use it, the types of signs and signals they will see and what to do in the event of a breakdown.’ He added: ’This really is the start of a new age on England’s motorways.’ But AA roads policy head Paul Watters said: ‘England’s first ‘all-lane running’ motorway with no hard shoulder  should be treated with caution by drivers. This is the first time the hard-shoulder has been ditched completely. ‘It marks a significant shift in UK motorway policy: rather than conventional widening, ‘making best use’ now uses existing carriageway with technology controlling traffic. The AA has said the new road rules should be treated with caution by drivers, as they could pose unseen risks . 'It is much cheaper but can hopefully safely provide the desperately needed extra capacity to reduce chronic congestion.’ Mr Watters noted: ‘Whilst we welcome the congestion-busting aspects of the scheme the AA has significant reservations. 'Permanent hard shoulder removal means that breakdowns and other emergencies could take place in a live traffic lane rather than the hard shoulder.’ Mr Watters said: ‘New 'smart' motorways depend on drivers complying with the rules of the road and safety advice. Safety also depends on a rapid response to incidents on the part of the road operator and technology.’ Speed limits on the new ‘smart’ section of the M25 will be policed by new  ‘stealth’ motorway cameras which can photograph cars across four separate  lanes. The new Hadecs 3 cameras – which are almost indistinguishable from conventional CCTV cameras. They will be mounted on gantries and on poles by the side of the road. But unlike most speed cameras, they will  be painted a dull grey rather than bright yellow – a move forced on ministers who insisted such cameras were ‘safety’ not revenue-raising, following an angry backlash from drivers. And there will be no tell-tale calibration road-markings. There will however be signs warning of cameras in operation. The cameras are also to be used on other of Britain’s busiest motorways including stretches of the M1, M6 and M25. The Highways Agency insisted they will be ‘visible’ but confirmed: ‘They will not be painted yellow.’ He  accepted that the Highways Agency has ‘gone to great lengths to minimise risk and build-in safety’ but  said it had also ‘cut back too hard’ on the technology used in the M42 pilot scheme.He said: ‘For example, on M25 there will be far fewer gantries and the emergency refuge area spacing is too great at 1.5 miles (2.5 kilometres). Mr Watters said: ‘A third more road space on one of the UK’s busiest sections of motorway will ease the daily stress of hundreds of thousands of drivers. However, they will have to come to terms with there being no hard shoulder and a need to follow strictly speed and lane instructions.’In an AA-Populus poll some 63per cent  of the 21,510 respondents agreed they would be more nervous driving on a motorway with no hard shoulder. And nearly 9 out of ten (87per cent) also agreed that having hard shoulders are what make motorways safe. By contrast nearly eight out of ten (77per cent) disagreed that because modern cars are more reliable hard shoulders are not needed.Big jams and gridlock on the M25 have caused it to be nicknamed  ‘Europe’s biggest car-park’,Mr Watters said: ‘At least the drivers trapped by regular chronic congestion on the M25 may breathe a sigh of relief but those unfortunate enough to be stopped in lane one may take a sharp intake of breath on occasions.’ ‘Motorways are our safest roads and that is how we want it to stay.’","Highways agency preparing to turn M25 into first 'permanent traffic lane'

"THEY last saw each other when he was just seven years' old. So Ed Miliband and his long lost aunt Sarah Ben Zvi had plenty to catch up on. The Labour leader and his wife Justine met her and other relatives for a traditional Friday night meal at a kibbutz near Tel Aviv last night. It was an emotional reunion for the Labour leader and the aunt he had not seen since he was seven years old . Mr Miliband and his wife Justine met with relatives for a traditional Friday night meal . Mrs Ben Zvi, left, is a cousin of the Labour leader's mother, Marion, and grew up with her in Poland before the Nazi invasion . Mrs Ben Zvi, 84, grew up with the Labour leader's mother Marion, her first cousin, in the town of Czestochowa in Poland. However, when the Nazis invaded in September 1939, life - until then comfortable - was turned upside down. German troops commandeered Marion's parents' steel factory which employed dozens of people, and torched Jewish schools and synagogues, before deportations began in 1942. Mr Miliband's mother, sister and grandmother fled, and sheltered by nuns in a convent - at a location she has never revealed - escaped persecution, at great personal risk to their protectors. Sarah and her mother were among those who were deported, when the Nazis, in September 1942, murdered around 2,000 Jews on the spot and sent another 40,000 to concentration camps. Sarah, only a teenager, survived. After the war the family were briefly reunited at the kibutz Mr Miliband visited last night. They then separated again, with Mr Miliband's mother heading to London in 1947, thanks to a charitable organisation, and eventually attended the London School of Economics, where she met his father Ralph. Mr Miliband's father had fled Nazi-occupied Belgium and served in the Royal Navy during the war. Sarah and her family stayed in Israel, which the Labour leader is visiting on a three-day tour. This included a visit on Thursday to the Yad Vashem Holocaust Memorial in Jerusalem - where he was presented with new research about Marion's father, believed to have died at Auschwitz. He is one of more than 60 members of Mr Miliband's family believed to have been killed in the Holocaust. Mr Miliband sees Israel as having a special place in his heritage due to the sanctuary it has given his family . The Leader of the Opposition looked through old family photo albums as he reunited with long-lost relatives . Mr Miliband's three-day trip around Israel is meant to be a mixture of personal and political occasions . When the Second World War broke out, Mr Miliband's father, Ralph, and grandfather, Sam, made their way to England. However, his grandmother Renee remained in Brussels to look after her young daughter, Nan. Renee eventually fled the city in 1942, after a gruelling interrogation by the Gestapo on the whereabouts of her husband and son. She was taken in by a family friends Maurice and Louisa Vos and she stayed on their farm for the rest of the war. After the war the family split up with some members, including Mr Miliband's mother, heading to London, while the rest settled in Israel. Sixty members of Mr Miliband's family were killed during the Holocaust and he yesterday visited the Yad Vashem Museum, which remembers those who lost their lives in the atrocity .

Darren has denied any knowledge of his wife's claim that she strangled or suffocated six of the babies soon after birth. The 39-year old-Huntsman, who has three daughters aged from 13to 21, said the seventh was stillborn. Pleasant Grove Police chief Michael Smith told Mail Online West had voluntarily submitted to a DNA test. He refused to speculate on the sex of the seven victims and said test results should be back in the next couple of days. He said: 'Mr West has been fully cooperative . He has had a DNA test which will help in determining the paternity of the seven babies. We are just waiting on the results from the medical examiner.'

'There is nothing to suggest they were involved,' said Smith. Hunstsman was arrested on Saturday at the home she shared with her boyfriend Jimmy Brady. Neighbours at the mobile home where they had lived for the past 18 months said Hunstsman had a miscarriage last year. Josh Flower, who lives next door to Huntsman, said she always seemed to adore children. 'She would always offer her services to babysit. She really did like being around children and had such a good way with them,' said Flowers. 'That is what makes this so hard to understand. 'How can someone who says she loves looking after children be the same person who then apparently suffocates seven of her own babies. 'It just does not make any sense.'

He said Jimmy Brady was attending his mother's funeral and returned home to find their home in the West Valley City area of Salt Lake City surrounded by police. 'It was just unreal. They said they were here to look for more evidence, I guess to see if any babies were buried here,' said Flowers. 'They were here a few hours and then left without finding anything.'

"One of the UK's top competitive growers says he and his rivals are installing lasers and expensive alarm systems to ward off potential saboteurs . Growers of giant vegetables have been known to sleep by their vegetables to protect their prized assets from saboteurs. But it seems some of the UK’s top competitive gardeners are now finding increasingly high-tech ways to guard their humongous produce. One of the UK’s top competitive growers says he and his rivals are installing lasers and expensive alarm systems to ward off potential saboteurs. Kevin Fortey, who runs the Giant Veg website, said he has set up infrared lights in his poly-tunnel and greenhouse which are linked to an alarm in his house. The gardener from Cwmbran in South Wales said his rivals – including Ian Neale, who produced the worlds-largest swede – have also set up alarm systems. With prizes of up to £1000, competition particularly heats up before the UK National Giant Vegetable Championships at the Malvern Autumn Show in September. Last summer, BBC documentary ‘Allotment Wars’ revealed plot owners’ prized vegetables were being snatched and their sheds ransacked by rivals. Mr Fortey joked that they may have got the idea from Wallace and Gromit: Curse of the Were-Rabbit, where the animated characters set up an alarm system to protect their giant marrows from a giant rabbit. He told Waitrose Weekend: ‘If someone’s got something big growing for a show there’s competitive rivalry. ‘I think there is always the fear that something might happen. It’s in the back of your mind.’ In America, competition is so fierce that many growers sleep by their pumpkins in order to protect rivals from sabotage. In America, competition is so fierce that many growers sleep by their pumpkins in order to protect rivals from sabotage . Yesterday, he added : ‘Over the last couple of years, more and more people have been setting up alarm systems. It’s often so they can protect their expensive Keder greenhouses. ‘We have seen poly-tunnels being slashed – though we don’t know if it’s competitiors or just mindless thugs.’ Sharon Gilbert, communications manager at the Malvern Autumn Show, said she wouldn’t be surprised in the slightest if competitors were resorting to alarm systems. She said: ‘There is a lot of competition among growers - they are very, very serious with what they do. They keep their growing secrets close to their chests.’ Mr Fortrey, who entered a 12 stone 3lb marrow at the 2010 competition, is entering in to 20 of the 24 classes this year.","Kevin Fortey has infrared lights in his poly-tunneland greenhouse .

"Terrible loss; Olivia Glennie, 15, hanged herself in September 2013. She is pictured here on a trip to Las Vegas the summer before she died . A schoolgirl hanged herself because she could not cope with the ‘21st-century pressures’ caused by social media and mobile phones, her father said yesterday. The family of 15-year-old Olivia Glennie had no idea anything was wrong before her death. He father Alex said the pressures of 24-hour communication by text, Facebook and the internet mean teenagers are faced with ‘too much, too young’, and parents need to be more aware of the danger signs. Olivia was found hanging from a tree in September by a dog walker. She was given resuscitation treatment and taken to hospital but died five days later. Talented and popular, Olivia was outwardly happy but was hiding insecurities about her boyfriend, her friends and her looks, an inquest heard. Her family said they were unaware of this as she ‘had everything to live for’ and had enjoyed her sister’s wedding just days before. Mr Glennie, 51, a contracts manager from Huddersfield, told the Daily Mail: ‘I can’t say what was going through her mind, I don’t think anybody in this world can. ‘Maybe people need to be more aware of the signs with teenagers in this day and age. With the internet and mobile phones and Facebook, I think they are getting too much, too young. It’s a cultural change. ‘Children are growing up so quickly. They have a lot of pressures, these 21st-century pressures.’ He said his daughter, who was 6ft 1in, could have been a model but was insecure about her teenage acne. ‘She would say to me, “Dad, I’ve got too many spots”,’ he said. ‘I have photographs of her with no makeup on and she still looks beautiful.’ A statement from Olivia’s mother, Diane, 49, was read to the inquest in Huddersfield. She said: ‘To be told that our beautiful daughter would not pull through brought unimaginable pain, all our hopes and dreams for her were shattered.‘ . She must have been in a really dark place at that time. This is something, as a mother, I wish I could have helped her with.’ The 15-year-old was hiding insecurities about her boyfriend, her friends and her looks. Her father said parents need to be more aware of 'the signs with teenagers in this day and age' The outwardly happy 15-year-old was found hanged from a tree in woods by a dog walker in Huddersfield, West Yorkshire, in September last year, just days after attending her sister Lucy's wedding - Wakefield Coroner's Court heard . Family said Olivia 'had everything to live for' and that she hoped to become a teacher after university . The . inquest heard from Olivia’s friends that she was upset about splitting . from her on-off boyfriend and had fallen out with a close friend. One . friend was aware she had been self-harming by cutting her hip, but her . parents did not know. Friends had been supportive and did not suspect . she was suicidal. Olivia had taken her French and history GCSEs early and was expecting A* and A grades in a further ten subjects. She had hoped to go to university and become a teacher. Her organs were donated, as she had requested, and her family recently received a letter saying she had helped save the lives of three people: a 14-year-old girl, a woman in her 20s and a man in his 30s whose successful kidney transplant has enabled him to take his first holiday abroad. Mr Glennie said: ‘She will be living on in somebody else. That is comforting to know.’ Assistant coroner Mary Burke said Olivia ‘had everyday issues that you would expect with a teen growing up’. She added: ‘She was a 15-year-old girl with a complex range of ever-increasing pressures and stresses which face adolescents in their daily lives.’ Recording a narrative verdict, she said she had doubts Olivia intended to take her own life and it was possible she believed she would be found before her actions proved fatal.

The chances of finding the wreckage of the Boeing 777 in an area 1500 miles north west of Perth depend on the underwater drone Bluefin-21, which was today being prepared for its third launch after two earlier search operations deep in the Ocean found nothing of any significance. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . The Bluefin-21 autonomous underwater vehicle, pictured being moved into position for deployment on Monday, has been forced back to the surface for a third time . The Joint Agency Co-ordination Centre (JACC) today announced the drone had been forced to resurface to rectify a technical issue . The device was loaded back onto the deck of the Australian vessel Ocean Shield, where its data was downloaded before it was put back to work again . Mr Abbott told the Wall Street Journal that if the drone fails to locate wreckage, believed by analysts to be lying some three to four miles down on the Ocean floor, a rethink on the search operation would have to be made. He remained confident, however, that the search was being conducted in the right area, based on electronic signals, possibly from the Malaysian Airlines' plane's black boxes - messages from the deep picked up by a 'ping' detecting device being towed behind the Australian ship Ocean Shield, . But while Mr Abbott held out what appeared to be diminishing hope, the use of Bluefin-21 has been criticised by the man who has been at the forefront of the search for the wreckage of the plane flown by aviation pioneer Amelia Earhart in 1937. Mr Richard Gillespie, Founder of the International Group for Historical Aircraft Recovery, said that on one of his many trips to the Pacific Ocean searching for the wreckage of the Earhart plane he had employed the use of Bluefin-21 - and found it lacking. 'I can tell you, it didn't work for us,' he told CNN. 'We were very hopeful the Bluefin-21 would be the answer, the way to search for the very hard to find wreckage. 'What we found was that the Bluefin-21 couldn't perform reliably, . 'We had extremely frustrating aborted missions, just as we have seen in the Indian Ocean.' During this week's searches, Bluefin has had to be brought back to the surface early in each of its first two dives. On the first occasion its safety programme kicked in when it reached a depth of about 3,000 miles and it came back to the surface. When it was deployed a second time, it had to be brought back up to repair 'technical issues' before it was put back Into the water. On each of the two dives it has found nothing that gives searchers any hope of locating the plane's wreckage. The introduction of the Bluefin marks a methodical, slower paced new phase of the search, now in its 40th day and described by the search coordinator, retired Air Chief Marshal Angus Houston, as the most expensive in aviation history . A Royal New Zealand Air Force P3 Orion takes off from RAAF Pearce Airbase in Bullsbrook, on Wednesday to assist with the international search effort for missing MH370 . The drone was forced to end its first deployment early on Monday after it exceeded its 4.5 km (14,750 feet) depth limit in the remote stretch of ocean where search authorities believe the jetliner crashed after its disappearance on March 8 with 239 people on board. The introduction of the Bluefin marks a methodical, slower paced new phase of the search, now in its 40th day and described by the search coordinator, retired Air Chief Marshal Angus Houston, as the most expensive in aviation history. U.S. Naval personnel have said the drone could take up to two months to scour a 600 sq km area where the plane is believed to have sunk.

"On September 15 next year, Britain will witness an extraordinary sight. High in the heavens, the Moon will turn an eerie blood-red —  filling the night sky with fiery radiance, as if Mars, the planet of war, has suddenly burst from its natural orbit and arrived on our doorstep. This spectacular vision will be the culmination of a rare — and, in the eyes of some, deeply ominous — astrological event, which began this week. On Tuesday, millions of people across America and much of the rest of the Western hemisphere saw exactly such a blood-red moon glowing above their heads for around an hour-and-a-half. That same moon will return over Earth three times in the next 17 months, making its final dramatic appearance over Britain. Scroll down for video . On September 15 next year Britain will witness a blood-red moon filling the sky. It will be the culmination of a rare astrological event that started this week when America and much of the Western hemisphere witnessed the phenomenon . Astronomers call this run of red moons a ‘tetrad’ but some doom-mongers have a different name for it: the End of the World. They insist that between the first and last eclipse, the world will be plunged into a cataclysmic downward spiral predicted by the Bible. This decline presages Armageddon, the arrival of the Anti-Christ and the Second  Coming of Christ. Forget rising sea levels, the Mayan calendar and Nostradamus — this is the big one. ‘There will be signs in the Sun, Moon, and stars… now when these things begin to happen, look up and lift up your heads, because your redemption draws near.’ So said Jesus in Luke’s gospel. In times gone by, people were understandably terrified of these ‘blood moons’. Our  ancestors greeted these infrequent and inexplicable arrivals in the night sky as harbingers of disaster or great change. As superstition gave way to greater scientific understanding in the 15th century, scientists discovered the Earth orbits the Sun, and the Moon spins around the Earth. A blood moon, they came to realise, occurs when the Sun, Earth and Moon align, and the Moon slips into the Earth’s shadow. It doesn’t darken completely because some sunlight still reaches it after passing through the Earth’s atmosphere. But the light — and therefore the Moon — takes on a reddish hue. However, there are still many who have looked upon this week’s moon with apprehension. For Tuesday’s was a very special one. It was the first of four consecutive total lunar eclipses, with no partial eclipses in between. The moon glows a red hue during the total lunar eclipse on Tuesday over Milwaukee. It was the first of four total lunar eclipses that will take place this year and next . Rational-minded astronomers will point out that while such tetrads are rare, they are not unheard of. And they have never yet heralded the end of days. Indeed, there have been 62 since the First Century AD. Ah, counter the prophets of doom, but this one is different. This particular tetrad coincides with two of Judaism’s holiest days. And the Jews, the Holy Land and God’s Chosen People, inevitably figure large in the Biblical predictions of the Apocalypse. This week’s eclipse coincided with Passover, the most important festival in the Jewish calendar, as will the third eclipse, which falls on April 4 next year. The second and fourth eclipses, on October 8 this year and September 15 next year, both fall on Sukkot, or the Feast of Tabernacles. So these eclipses are deemed to be especially significant. But there’s still more, say advocates of what has been dubbed the Blood Moon Prophecy. According to a clutch of number-crunching American pastors, each of the last three occasions when tetrads have fallen over Passover and Sukkot coincided with traumatic events for the Jews. A tetrad in 1493-1494 came just after the 1492 expulsion of the Jews from Spain, while a 1949-1950 tetrad followed just after the establishment of the state of Israel and the first Arab-Israeli War. As for the most recent tetrad, in 1967-1968, it started just before the Six-Day War, when Israel was once again threatened by its enemies. Astronomers call this run of lunar eclipses a 'tetrad' but some doom-mongers have a different name for the event (pictured in the skies over the Bryce Canyon in Utah on Tuesday) - the end of the world . The Bible’s Book of Revelations, which tells how the world will end, makes clear the Second Coming will be preceded by Jerusalem being surrounded by armies. The resulting strife, plague and pestilence, during which God will judge non-believers, will last seven years before Christ returns to Earth. With Syria aflame, Egypt in turmoil, Russia throwing its weight around and the Iranians threatening Israel, you don’t need to be a wild-eyed conspiracy theorist (though it helps) to see signs of impending destruction. The tetrad isn’t just a sign of things to come, says Texan pastor John Hagee, a popular U.S. ‘televangelist’ who’s made a fortune from predicting Armageddon. He claims the four blood moons are messages from God projected on to the heavens. ‘The question,’ he asks, ‘is are we listening?’ He and another pastor, Mark Biltz, of Washington state, are ‘Blood Moon Prophets’. They first stumbled on the theory in 2008 after matching NASA eclipse records with moments in Jewish history. They can quote Bible-verse after verse about how the ‘End Times’  will be presaged by a bloody or darkened moon. They argue that the very first chapter of the Bible, Genesis, makes clear that God wanted to communicate with Man through Nature, creating the Sun, Moon and stars to provide ‘signs’. The Old Testament’s Book of Joel speaks of how ‘the sun shall be turned into darkness, and the moon into blood, before the great and the terrible day of the Lord comes’. This week's eclipse coincided with Passover, the most important festival in the Jewish calender, as will the third which falls on April4 next year. The second and fourth eclipses on October 8 this year and September 15 next year both fall on Sukkot, or the Feast of Taberbnacles, so they are deemed especially significant . The Book of Revelations also talks of how, just before the Day of Judgment, ‘the whole moon turned blood red’. In a prophecy that is repeated again and again, Isaiah speaks of the Second Coming: ‘The Sun will be dark when it rises and the Moon will not shed its light.’ Pastor Biltz says he has sold more than 70,000 copies of his new book, Blood Moons: Decoding the Imminent Heavenly Signs, in just four weeks. But that’s nothing compared with his prophet-of-doom rival, Mr Hagee, whose Four Blood Moons: Something Is About To Change was one of America’s best-selling books for several weeks when it came out last year. Mr Biltz initially claimed the tetrad’s final eclipse of September next year would coincide with the Second Coming. But that ignored the golden rule of successful apocalypse prediction — if you don’t want to look silly, don’t tie yourself down to dates. He is now wisely hedging his bets. ‘I’m not saying whether it is or  isn’t going to be the Second Coming in a year and a half. I don’t have the word “stupid” written on my head,’ he told me. ‘But we are living in the Last Days. I believe the Second Coming is approaching.’ Pastor John Hagee believes the same. Tuesday marked the dawn of a ‘hugely significant event’ for the world, he said. ‘God is shouting to us: “Something big is about to happen!”’ Centuries ago, people would bang on pots and pans during a red eclipse, trying to scare away the monster that was eating the moon. What are the fearful doing now? According to a number of American pastors, each of the last three occasions when tetrads have fallen over Passover and Sukkot, it has coincided with traumatic events for the Jews.The most recent tetrad in 1967-1968 started just before the Six Day War when Israel was once again threatened by its enemies . America is rife with ‘Doomsday Preppers’, an estimated three million people who are stockpiling food and weapons — some even digging bunkers — in preparation for what they see as the imminent collapse of the U.S. Some believe Barack Obama’s administration will cause this nightmare scenario but just as many believe in an Apocalypse as predicted in the Bible and set into motion by this week’s blood moon. Of course, those who fervently believe in this particular doomsday theoretically have nothing to be scared about. They are the God-fearing folks who’ll be taken up to Heaven. It’s the rest of the world that has to worry. Pastor Biltz insists nobody in his 800-strong congregation is fretting about the approaching storm: ‘When there’s a Second Coming and they’re righteous, they have nothing to fear.’ However many Christians, even in America’s fundamentalist Bible Belt, have no time for the prophecy. Mark Hitchcock, a preacher and biblical prophecy expert, has written his own book telling the faithful not to worry about blood moons. ‘I know people who are very  concerned over this blood moon prophecy,’ he says. ‘These sorts of theories are gaining traction because people are fearful. ‘With Syria, Ukraine and Iran, as well as mounting social and economic problems, a lot of people are ready to believe that everything is spinning out of control and coming to an end.’ There is, he insists, no need to panic. Let’s hope he’s right!","On Tuesday millions in America saw a total lunar eclipse in the skies .

"With as many as nine different bins and boxes, it is no wonder some of us find recycling fairly confusing. But now councils have found a way of shaming those who sort their waste incorrectly – attaching red tags to the offending containers. In a pilot scheme, those who put, for example, a margarine pot in a bin meant for plastic bottles, will find that instead of emptying it, waste collectors will attach a red label saying ‘wrong stuff, wrong bin’. Confusing: Residents who do not recycle correctly will not have the offending waste collected (file photo) Binmen will also be issued with green ‘right stuff, right bin’ tags for containers that are correctly filled. Yoghurt pots, plastic food trays and carrier bags are among the items most often placed in the wrong bin. One area adopting the scheme is Bolton. Councillor Elaine Sherrington, the Labour authority's cabinet member for waste, recycling and housing, said: 'A large number of people in the borough already work hard at recycling most of their waste. 'However, some people still struggle to identify the correct items for each bin and this could be for a number of reasons. 'It is always good to try new ideas to raise the level of recycling, which in turn saves the town money. I hope people will get involved with this new initiative which should make a difference.' Bin collection: Residents in Halliwell already have to sort their waste into four wheelie bins (file photo) Residents already have to sort their waste into four wheelie bins, and under the pilot scheme - operating in the Halliwell area - if they dispose of an item in the wrong one, it will be left unemptied. The Right Stuff, Right Bin campaign is being introduced into other areas of Greater Manchester, all chosen for their poor recycling record, and is intended as a short-term measure in conjunction with an information campaign. An initial pilot in nearby Rochdale increased recycling by 56 per cent and reduced cross-contamination by 61 per cent. The scheme is funded by Recycle for Greater Manchester which said the region's 42 per cent recycling rate cost residents £25million a year which would be better spent on schools and community projects. Last week it emerged that Gwynedd council in North Wales is proposing to cut its rubbish collection to once every three weeks, to the fury of some residents.","Scheme piloted in parts of Greater Manchester with poor recycling rates .

"Tragic loss: Henry Miller died aged only 19 . A British teenager who died after taking a hallucinogenic drug in a tribal ritual during a gap year in Colombia was encouraged to try it by his hostel. Henry Miller, 19, from Bristol, took Yage – which induces vivid hallucinations – while taking part in a tribal ritual in remote rainforest. His body was later found dumped on a dirt track. His grieving family said the teenager, who was due to go to university in September, suffered a reaction to the plant infusion after the hostel he was staying at recommended the drink. The Casa del Rio hostel in Mocoa in the Putumayo region promoted the drug on the ‘things to do’ section of its website. Yage is said to create hallucinations more extreme than those caused by LSD, ketamine or magic mushrooms. The website entry read: ‘Experience Yage, Indian tradition taking a medicinal plant which purifies and can make you hallucinate’. However, yesterday the reference was deleted from the hostel’s website. Owner Felipe Geomare told The Mail on Sunday Henry checked out of the hostel before he died. Mr Geomare said: ‘I have nothing to do with the ritual or the indigenous community in which it’s taken. Many tourists want to become part of the ritual and ask to take Yage and so I help them organise it but it’s not my fault.’ Henry’s parents Elizabeth and David, both 52, paid tribute to their ‘adventurous, polite and very much loved’ son in a statement yesterday. Colombian police are now investigating the death, and the people who supplied the drug.","Henry Miller, 19, died after taking Yage while in Columbia .

"With questions still unanswered whether missing MH370 was sabotaged, Special Branch police in Kuala Lumpur today began a sabotage inquiry into a drama involving another Malaysian Airlines jet. Police Chief Halid Abu Bakar confirmed that an investigation had begun into whether flight MH192, which had to turn back to Kuala Lumpur while flying to India, had been interfered with before take off. The Boeing 737-800 aircraft, with 166 people on board, landed safely in Kuala Lumpur after a tyre burst and the right hand landing gear malfunctioned. Fears: Police have confirmed they are investigating whether flight MH192, which had to turn back to Kuala Lumpur while flying to India, was interfered with before take off . Relief: After the incident Malaysia's Acting Transport Minister Hishammuddin Hussein posted this picture on Twitter as he met the passengers off the plane, adding: 'Their faces says it all (sic)... Thank God they are safe' Safe: Passengers of flight MH192 were relieved to step off the aircraft after an emergency landing . As passengers praised the pilot for . the safe landing, Acting Transport Minister Hishammuddin Hussein . demanded that the police begin an investigation into the incident. Inspector . General of Police Mr Bakar then announced that a thorough investigation . would be carried out to establish if there were 'elements of sabotage' involved in the emergency. Mr . Hishammuddin, who has been a central figure in the investigation into . the disappearance of MH730, has given Malaysian Airlines just two days . to furnish the Malaysian cabinet with a preliminary report into the . incident. After the incident he posted a picture on Twitter as he met . the passengers off the plane and reflected: 'Their faces says it all . (sic)... Thank God they are safe'. The aircraft had to conduct a turn-around during a routine 90-minute flight to Bangalore and make an emergency landing back at Kuala Lumpur airport three hours after take-off. The Minister said the airline did not have a reason to be unable to provide an early report into the incident. Route: Flight MH192 suffered a serious landing gear malfunction shortly after taking off in Kuala Lumpur on a routine 90 minute journey to Bangalore in India . Malaysian Minister of Transportation Hishammuddin Hussein (2nd L) talks with passengers after the flight suffered a landing gear malfunction . Problems: The Boeing 737 was forced to make the emergency landing after reporting a landing gear failure shortly after take-off . The Department of Civil Aviation has also been asked to provide cabinet with a report as soon as possible, said the Minister. 'Such . incidents should not have happened,' said Mr Hishammuddin, despite the . aircraft, piloted by Captain Nor Adam Azmi Abdul Razak and co-pilot . Prakash Kumar, landing safely. 'This . is why I have asked the DCA and the police Special Branch to conduct a . review on the national carrier's standard operating procedures . concerning their flights.' Despite . his apparent deep concerns, he praised the pilots and cabin crew for . showing 'outstanding leadership' in handling the ordeal. 'I . am very proud of the pilots and crew members who kept the passengers . informed and calm until the aircraft landed without incident,' he said. Mr Hishammuddin Hussein answers questions after the Malaysia Airlines scare . Passengers on the flight also praised the pilot for doing a 'good job' in landing the plane safely. Several said they knew there was something wrong with the plane after a bumpy take-off . But . the Minister said he did not discount the possibility of sabotage . following incidents that have struck the national carrier in recent . weeks. He . was referring to two emergency landings of other Malaysian Airlines . planes - one in Hong Kong and the other in Kathmandu - and the . prevailing mystery of MH370. Passengers on the flight also praised the pilot for doing a 'good job' in landing the plane safely. Several . said they knew there was something wrong with the plane after a . particularly bumpy take-off, although the cabin crew were able to keep . everybody calm. Marta . Alonso, a Spanish citizen travelling to Bangalore to star a new hob as a . telecommunications engineer, said she knew something was not right as . soon as the plane took off. 'It . was bumpy and shaky. Not long after that the pilot announced we needed . to make an emergency landing. It was frightening,' she said. Australian . national Maslahuddin Khan, 40, also praised the pilot: 'There was . turbulence during the departure but the landing procedure was handled . well. We panicked at first but all remained calm.' The . malfunction came nearly two months after Maylasia Airlines lost flight . MH370, which mysteriously vanished en route to Beijing. Hunt: The disappearance last month of Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 has prompted a multinational search effort, which is now focused on the Indian Ocean . 'New plans': Over the weekend Malaysia's defence minister gave a deadline of today before a new approach would need to be taken in the ongoing search for MH370 . The . Boeing 777 has still yet to be found, despite weeks of extensive . searches in the southern Indian Ocean where it was ruled to have . crashed, killing all 239 people on board. Aircraft . and ships continued to search the Indian Ocean north west of Perth . today, while the Bluefin-21 underwater search vehicle scoured the ocean . bed. But, as in previous days, searchers have failed to find any clue to the whereabouts of the aircraft. Over . the weekend Malaysia's defence minister gave a deadline of today before . new plans would need to be made regarding the ongoing search for MH370. On Saturday Mr Hishammuddin . Hussein, who is also the country's Acting Transport Minister, said it . was his understanding 'that the search effort is entering a critical . stage in the next 48 hours'. 'Whatever happens in that period, we will then regroup and discuss our next move.' Mr . Hisammuddin was speaking in Kuala Lumpur as the underwater drone . Bluefin-21 was sent on its seventh mission 1500 miles north west of . Perth, Western Australia, to search for any sign of the wreckage of the . Boeing 777 aircraft. The . Minister's reference to just 48 hours revealed less optimism than . comments by Australia's Prime Minister, Tony Abbott, who had forecast . that the search would continue at least until the end of this week.","Plane suffered landing gear malfunction after taking off in Kuala Lumpur .

Among them veteran soldier Lance-Corporal Jones, wet Private Godfrey, doom-mongering Private Frazer and the young, deemed infirm Private Pike. The TV series, which was first broadcast in 1968 and ran until 1977, pulled in 18million viewers at its peak – and two million still tune in to watch repeats. Jimmy Perry, 90, who came up with the idea for the show and wrote it with David Croft, will be a producer on the film. The film script has been written by Hamish McColl, who wrote the hit British films Jonny English Reborn and Mr Bean’s Holiday. Director Oliver Parker, who made the two St Trinian’s movies, has also been lined up for the project. The main producer Damian Jones, whose credits include The Iron Lady and The History Boys, says it was Dad’s Army’s ‘universal appeal’ that had attracted him. Writer: Jimmy Perry, 90, who came up with the idea for the show and wrote it with David Croft, will be a producer on the film . The longevity of the programme’s success has been attributed to the superb cast of supporting characters along with their catchphrases that have stood the test of time. Jones, who was played by Clive Dunn, had regular lines such as ‘Don’t panic’ and ‘They don’t like it up ’em’, which have become synonymous with the show. Stuart Wright, chairman of the Dad’s Army museum in Thetford, Norfolk, where the series was filmed, said tours of the town still attracted several thousand visitors a year. Mr Wright added: ‘David Croft used to point out the jokes were 30 years out of date when the series went out so they have certainly stood the test of time.’ A number of the actors from the original series had experienced war. Arnold Ridley, who played Godfrey, had been wounded on the Somme in World War One. Dunn had spent four years as a German prisoner of war, during the 1940s. The young Private Pike was based on Perry’s experiences as a young member of the Home Guard. The character of the Scotsman Private Frazer was based partly on that of John  Laurie, the actor who played him. He once complained: ‘I have played every major Shakespeare role … And I end up becoming famous for this c**p.’","Dad's Army being made into feature film nearly 50 years after first aired .

"Crystal meth made in laboratories in North Korea is flooding the world's drugs market, with shipments ferried through China to distribute across the globe. In the U.S. police officers have intercepted batches of the highly addictive drug, that were bound for New York after being produced in Kim Jong-un's Communist state. Analysis of the highly potent drugs - which come in the form of ice-like crystals which are smoked, to provide a powerful and near-immediate hit - showed they were up to 99 per cent pure.

North Korea is said to be in the grip of a crystal meth epidemic with the drug being produced on an industrial scale by corrupt officials in collusion with criminal gangs and the number of addicts spiralling. Use . of meth is reportedly so common in the shadowy communist state that . offering some to house guests has been described as the equivalent of . making them a cup of tea. In some parts of North Korea up to 50 . per cent of the population are reported to be hooked. Parents even offer . it to children to help them concentrate on their studies. As . one of the few commodities easily available, it is used for everything . from treating colds to curbing hunger pangs during times of food . shortages.

In an interview with the LA Times . earlier this year one North Korean, Lee Saera, 43, of Hoeryong described . how prevalent the drug has become. She said: 'If you go to somebody's . house it is a polite way to greet somebody by offering them a sniff. It . is like drinking coffee when you're sleepy, but ice is so much better.' Such is the explosion in the drug's popularity that a new word ‘munlan’ has sprung up to describe meth addicts. Experts say the .

Then . it was exported, mostly to China, with reports of North Korean . diplomats being sent abroad with their bags stuffed full with meth. Studies from the US and China found soaring levels of crystal meth addiction in border regions with North Korea. As . state-controlled production was curbed in the late 2000s the trade went . underground with meth 'cook' criminals setting up small 'kitchen laboratories'. The Sun reported that in 2012, police officers in the U.S. intercepted 30kg of the drug - with 99 per cent purity - that was destined for the streets of New York.

"Former Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius maneuvered one of America's richest liberal philanthropies into contributing $13 million to Enroll America, a group founded by a former Obama White House staffer to drive up insurance enrollment numbers under the Affordable Care Act. A report issued Monday by the Government Accountability Office shows what Republican members of Congress ave anticipated learning since 2013: that Sebelius called a total of five organizations a year ago and urged them to help Enroll America reach its goals. One call went to the CEO of the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, which made $3 million and $10 grants to the group after hearing her request. That amount was a dramatic increase from the $150,000 it had contributed the previous year. The foundation, known for bankrolling gun-control, diet-control, anti-alcohol and anti-tobacco campaigns, improbably insists that that the decision to award the money was 'not made in response to the Secretary's call.' Kathleen Ssbelius (L) stood alongside a smirking Barack Obama on April 11 as her successor Sylvia Burwell (R) was presented to the public. Sebelius allegedly pressured corporations and one philanthropy into donating to a pro-Obamacare group founded by a former White House aide . Enroll America president Anne Filipic (C, in yellow, shown at a 2013 'Get Covered' event) was the White House's deputy chief of public engagement, and the Democratic National Committee's deputy executive director, before leading the Obamacare cheerleading group . Dr. Risa Lavizzo-Mourey, president and CEO of the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, made $13 million in commitments to Enroll America after a phone call from Kathleen Sebelius . Sebelius also asked the tax-preparation giant H&R Block for funds, but that company decided against giving. Three more calls from Sebelius went to Kaiser Permanente, Ascension Health and Johnson & Johnson – all companies HHS regulates. The independent GAO report concluded that Sebelius sought 'nonfinancial support' from them for Enroll America, 'such as technical assistance.' Texas Sen. John Cornyn told MailOnline that 'Kathleen Sebelius' shake-down of the very health companies her department regulates is a gross abuse of government power.' 'After putting taxpayers on the hook for billions of dollars in Obamacare spending,' said the hard-charging Republican, 'a full investigation is needed to account for all the money wasted and the need to fundraise from the health industry.' Others in the GOP had equally harsh words. 'I have said all along that Obamacare is a complete disaster,' Arizona Republican Rep. Paul Gosar told MailOnline. 'Now we learn it’s so bad that Secretary Sebelius attempted to solicit donations from an industry that her department is supposed to regulate in order to persuade folks to sign up.' Gosar pointed to Obamacare alternatives like the American Health Care Reform Act, a GOP-sponsored alternative plan that he called 'patient-centered' and 'market-based.' 'The evidence couldn’t be more clear that Obamacare just doesn’t work,' he said. Tennessee GOP Sen. Lamar Alexander's office was more biting, with spokesman Jim Jeffires writing that his boss 'hopes that the next Secretary of HHS will not ask the entities she regulates to support the president’s allies.' Sebelius is on her way out after a lackluster Obamacare program launch and a series of missteps that included meltdowns in front of congressional committees. Her successor, current White House budget chief Sylvia Mathews Burwell, is expected to be confirmed in May. But Sebelius has clung to the assertion that she has always had the legal authority to ask for donations to outside groups that support President Obama's agenda. 'Obamacare is a complete disaster,' said Arizona GOP Rep. Paul Gosar, complaining that Sebelius had to 'solicit donations from an industry that her department is supposed to regulate in order to persuade folks to sign up' Enroll America? Obamacare hit the March 31 finish line with a contested bit of good news, but spent most of its first six months in the Internet's version of after-school detention . Sebelius' tenure at HHS was marked by flailing performances before Congress and a tendency to underperform in her role as Obamacare's quarterback. HHS's Office of General Counsel told Sebelius in February 2013, GAO wrote, that she was permitted to 'encourage members of the public to support certain organizations assisting Americans to enroll' in Obamacare coverage. The written legal advice, which stopped short of saying she had the authority to pressure corporations or private foundations, came after her call with the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation. Snark: A spokesman wrote thatTennessee GOP Sen. Lamar Alexander 'hopes that the next Secretary of HHS will not ask the entities she regulates to support the president¿s allies' Sebelius dismissed the idea last year that she was shaking down organizations to help a politically favored nonprofit. 'If they felt pressure, they misunderstood,' she told a House Committee on Education & The Workforce hearing in June 2013, according to the Post. 'I can't answer what they felt.' She also insisted that she 'could legally solicit funds from anybody regulated by our office,' but claimed – in contradiction to Monday's report – that 'I chose not to do that.' In 2013 HHS officials told Congress that Sebelius was the only federal government employee to solicit money for Enroll America. But according to Monday's GAO report, White House Deputy Assistant for Health Policy Jeanne Lambrew teed up the conversation for Sebelius with a Robert Wood Johnson Foundation employee in 2012. GAO reported that the foundation said Lambrew 'estimated that Enroll America or other similar national enrollment organizations would likely need about $30 million to finance a national outreach effort' for Obamacare enrollment. 'RWJF told us that the official also indicated a hope that RWJF would provide a significant financial contribution to support such efforts,' but did not name a specific price tag. Months later, with the Obama administration's permission, the foundation's CEO announced the $10 million grant to Enroll America during a White House meeting of liberal foundation executives.' The Robert Wood Johnson Foundation also committed more than $834,000 in 2010 and 2011 to create Enroll America, which spun off from the progressive Families USA Foundation. In 2012 White House Office of Public Engagement deputy director Anne Filipic left the administration to become Enroll America's president. She was previously the deputy executive director at the Democratic National Committee. It's this sort of revolving-door politics, practiced on both sides of the aisle, that has Republican lawmakers steamed. 'The conflict of interest is hard to avoid,' said Texas Rep. Kevin Brady, addressing Sebelius' approach of companies she was in charge of regulating. 'Our . government and government officials should be held to a higher standard than . this, and the American people deserve better.'","Outgoing health secretary insists she was legally authorized to ask businesses she regulated for help with funding for Enroll America .

"The first new ‘baby’ Land Rover Discovery has been spotted on British Roads – under heavy disguise. The camouflaged car was spotted in Coventry where Jaguar Land Rover has its world-leading Whitley design and engineering centre. The new Discovery is the latest model announced by prolific Jaguar Land Rover, which is experiencing its greatest ever period. What is believed to be the new'baby' Land Rover Discovery has been spotted in Coventry before it is on sale. But the new car has been covered in an eye-catching pattern, to stop petrolheads spotting the new design . Spot that: Side view of what is believed to be the first new 'baby' Land Rover Discovery . The spotted car was camouflaged, but there were clear signs that it is a prototype of the new Discovery family, which was unveiled at the New . York International Motor Show earlier this month. The new Discovery Sport will be the . first in a brand new ‘Discovery family’ of upmarket 4X4s. They will go on . sale in showroom next year priced at between £25,000 and £45,000. Land Rover, which describes the new off-roader as a ‘premium compact sports utility vehicle’, says the model will be more ‘versatile’ than the long-running Freelander, which comes to the end of the road after nearly 15 years. There is speculation that it will include seven seats, just as the existing larger Discovery model already features. Jaguar Land Rover is experiencing one of its best periods, with sales and profits booming, thanks to models such as the Range Rover Evoque and the stunning Jaguar F-Type. Last year, MailOnline revealed how teenager Rob Barker spotted the new Jaguar F-Type Coupe six . months before it went on sale. The camouflaged model was spotted in Coventry earlier today . Coventry . The . £80,000 sought-after sports car was seen by the 18-year-old in a . supermarket car park in Leamington Spa, which is around ten miles from . the company's headquarters in Gaydon, Warwickshire. In . July MailOnline also reported how the brand new Rolls Royce Wraith was . spotted in the street as one of the engineers tested it on the road . before it went on sale. The pictures emerged before it had even made its public debut at the Goodwood Festival of Speed in West Sussex. In November, MailOnline revealed how teenager Rob Parker spotted the Jaguar F-Type coupe in a supermarket car park six months before it went on sale . The car, which made its debut at the Los Angeles motor show, was spotted in Leamington Spa, around ten miles from Gaydon, Warwickshire, where the headquarters for Jaguar Land Rover is based . The latest launch from the company will see the Land Rover range split into three distinct groups – luxurious Range Rover, versatile Discovery and . down-to-earth Defender. Range Rover will spread from the largest version to the compact Evoque. Go-anywhere Defenders could range from big and beefy to a small, fun, open-topped beach-buggy style versions. Land Rover design director and chief creative officer Gerry McGovern announced at New York Show:  ‘I am proud to confirm the nameplate that will make Discovery a family of vehicles for the first time. It will be called Discovery Sport and will go on sale in 2015. ‘This will be the most versatile and capable sports utility vehicle in its segment and is the first expression of the Discovery Vision Concept unveiled here in New York.’ He added: ’This car encapsulates our vision for a Discovery family. Rather than produce one car that fits all, we wanted to do a family that can broaden our reach – just as the Evoque did with Range Rover.’ Last week, Land Rover unveiled its new Discovery Concept, above, which can be driven 'at very low speed' using a smart phone, tablet or the car's removable console . Mr McGovern said the SUV market will be more than 20 million cars a year by 2020 and that the biggest sector will be leisure SUVs. He said: ’We’ve produced a very dramatic, distinctive silhouette that’s very premium, but with a visual robustness. ‘The car hides its size well. As with the Range rover, we’ve used visual trickery, with lamps that wrap around to make the car look compact and a higher butt to make it look athletic.’ A Land Rover spokesman said: ’This demonstrates Land Rover’s design vision for a future family of premium sports utility vehicles built on  our key principles of emotive design, unrivalled capability and ultimate versatility.' The company is also investing billions in research and development and the hard work is paying off. Last year it delivered 425,000 vehicles, an increase of 19 per cent. One unique feature of the prototype 'Discovery Vision' will be a remote-control drive, which allows anyone to drive the vehicle while not actually seated inside it . The flash car will also feature laser positioning sensors, gesture-controlled systems and an 'invisible' bonnet that allows the driver to 'see through' the car to the ground beneath . Land Rover used the prototype . ‘Discovery Vision’ in New York to showcase its cutting-edge James Bond . style technology which boasts a range of gadgets, including a remote . control drive. The company said the car could be driven at a 'very low speed' without anyone in . the driver's seat, either using a smart phone, console or the car's own . removable console. It also includes ‘see-through’ technology that gives drivers the sense of  Superman-style ‘x-ray eyes’ to look beyond the metal at what danger lurk beneath their vehicles. That system combines cameras in the grille and jet-fighter-style head-up display technology on the windscreen to create the appearance of a  ‘transparent’ bonnet. A Land Rover spokesman said: ‘The technology provides full visibility of what is underneath and in front of the car, with total clarity of otherwise hidden obstacles. ‘It enables a driver climbing a steep incline or manoeuvring in a confined space to see an augmented reality view capturing not only the terrain in front of the car but also the angle and position of the front wheels. ‘It breaks new ground in visual driver assistance. And it shows how advanced technology will take Land Rover’s unrivalled capability to the next level.’","The first new 'baby' Land Rover Discovery spotted in Coventry .

This map, created by the United States Geological Survey (USGS), shows the areas of the mainland where those roads are most densely populated and also those area where they are a lot more scarce. Roads were the backbone of America’s great growth and expansion during the 20th century, helping transport raw materials, processed goods and people across vast distances of the 48 states that make up the continental United States. The yellow areas of . This map was created by the United States Geological Survey, the yellow areas show the parts of the country where roads are most densely populated, while green shows the areas with fewest access . According to the USGS, documented roads and their rights-of-way now occupy approximately one percent of the land area of the U.S., roughly the size of South Carolina. This map, which was compiled by the USGS in 2005, splits the mainland into 1km squared cells and then colors each cell depending on the distance to the nearest road. The conterminous 48 states are comprised of some 7.5 million cells. Those areas of highest road density are colored yellow and on the map typically represent the country’s larger urban centers, although some yellow areas are also around energy extraction activities such as the oil and gas fields of West Texas and the Texas Panhandle. Areas of moderately high road density are colored blue and these are typically areas where terrain and vegetation made it possible to built roads and  there was also a motivation - farming - for making land accessible. Hit the freeway: Roads were the backbone of America’s great growth and expansion during the 20th century, helping transport raw materials, processed goods and people across vast distances of the 48 states that make up the continental United States . Blue areas occur in all states and are particularly prominent across the Great Plains, in the Central and Imperial Valleys of California and to the west of the Cascade Mountains in the Pacific Northwest. The Atlantic Seaboard, outside of cities, is also shaded this color. Low road density area are shaded turquoise such as the valleys and ridges of the Appalachian Mountains. Other areas with few roads are the arid lands of the West, from the sand hills of Nebraska to the deserts of Arizona, New Mexico, Nevada and southeastern California. With agricultural productivity low there was also little motivation for building a dense network of roads. Green represents areas remote from roads such as the Rocky Mountains, Sierra Nevada, the swamps of southern Florida and Louisiana and areas with extreme climates such as northern Maine and Minnesota. 'Roads are the circulatory system of our culture.

"Tragic: Part of the large apartment complex from which the five-year-old fell in Jakarta, Indonesia . A five-year-old boy fell to his death from his 19th-floor bedroom window after he was refused permission to watch the latest Spider-Man movie, according to reports. Naming him only as Valentino, police in Indonesia said the boy locked himself in his room at an apartment complex in the capital Jakarta after an argument with his mother. Officers said they were investigating the possibility the tragic youngster may have mimicked his screen hero or, despite his tender age, taken his own life. However, the fall could also have been no more than a tragic accident. According to Indonesian media the boy was in the bath on Thursday when he asked his mother, a 23-year-old woman named as Eva, if he could see the latest superhero film. The Amazing Spider-Man 2 was released in Indonesia on Wednesday and has been a smash hit, scoring the country's highest opening day box office figures of all time. But the boy's mother said he could not go because his one-year-old brother Vincencius was ill and she wanted to visit the toddler at her mother's house, kompas.com reported. 'This made Valentino very upset,' senior police commander Suyudi told the website. 'He wanted to see the movie. 'After his request was declined, Valentino then rushed to his room and locked it from the inside.' The police chief continued: 'She went down to the second floor to ask for help from a caretaker, but while talking to him she heard a commotion outside.' The child's body was found on the fibreglass roof of the food court in the apartment complex, according to reports. The noise heard by his mother was people rushing to try and help him after he fell. He was taken to the nearby Pluit Hospital in north Jakarta, but was pronounced dead on arrival.

Initially police said they were investigating the possibility that the boy had taken his own life. The window in the apartment was easily accessible from his bed. However, police have also said he was a 'hyperactive' child who enjoyed imitating his screen heroes. 'He liked to imitate films like Iron Man and Captain America after every watch,' the head of the criminal investigation unit told Kompas on Friday. The fall could also have simply been an accident, investigators said. The tragic case recalls the death of six-year-old Kevin Morais, who was climbing along the window ledge in his bedroom on the third floor of his home in London when he lost his grip and fell. His mother, nurse Maria Morais, heard the fall and found her ‘naughty little boy’ lying in a pool of blood. She called an ambulance but the child was unresponsive. He was said to have believed he was 'invincible' like his hero, Spider-Man.

"It must be one of the most bizarre acts of ‘charity’ ever performed. The tour manager of boyband One Direction has visited two British drugs smugglers in a Peru jail – to give them Easter eggs and a KFC. Paul Higgins went to see cocaine mules Melissa Reid and Michaella McCollum Connolly – nicknamed the Peru Two – when One Direction went to Lima for a concert. Impromptu visit: Paul Higgins (right), manager of One Direction, discussed 'fame' with Michaella McCollum Connelly (left, background) and Melissa Reid .

As well as giving chocolate eggs and takeaway meals to the 20-year-olds, Higgins handed out free tickets for the concert to the children of families visiting the prison. The Irishman also talked to the women about dealing with the pressures of ‘fame’. Last night a source close to the band said: ‘Paul does a lot of work for charity that you just don’t hear about. ‘He was in Peru with One Direction and during his downtime he decided that the Christian thing to do would be to visit an Irish person [McCollum Connolly is from Belfast] who was in prison. The Irishman brought the 20-year-olds chocolate eggs and KFC, and handed free tickets to prisoners' children .

'He does not know her [Michaella] or the family and he did not tell any of One Direction that he was going. ‘He was just trying to do a good deed as he felt that there wouldn’t be many visitors coming from Ireland to see them. 'He is not there to judge them for what they did nor does he condone anything they have done.’ They are on a tour of Latin America. Here, some of the members are pictured in Santiago, Chile . Billy Reid, father of Melissa, who is from Lenzie, near Glasgow, said last night: ‘It’s great of him to do that and take time out of his busy schedule to visit them. I’m sure Melissa and Michaella would have been thrilled. ‘I think it will have helped the girls to hear about how One Direction cope with fame because since everything has happened they’ve been pushed into the spotlight… but obviously for different reasons.’ The women were each jailed for six years and eight months in December after trying to smuggle £1.5 million worth of cocaine out of Peru in their suitcases.","Paul Higgins visited Lima jail during boyband's tour of Latin America .

"Thousands of Eastern Europeans are making little or no income tax contributions despite working full-time, a report claims today. The UK’s generous tax credits system means thousands of migrants without partners or children, who earn the minimum wage, pay just £1-a-week net income tax, including National Insurance. If they have a non-working partner and children, it costs the taxpayer money to support them, according to Migration Watch. The UK's tax credits system means thousands of migrants without partners or . children, who earn the minimum wage, pay just £1-a-week net income tax, . including National Insurance . A singe earner couple with two children receives nearly £90 a week more in benefits than they pay in tax. With two children, the cost rises to £295. For three children it is £400, four children £500 and five children £600 per week. The think-tank’s analysis said a couple where both partners work on minimum wage would pay in a total £28 net. But if they have two children they could receive a net benefit of £380 a week. The group added that the calculations do not include indirect taxes such as VAT nor do they include health, education and social services. There are also major costs in later life, for pensions and health, to which the low-paid will make no significant contribution. These could amount to £120,000 for a single pensioner and £160,000 for a couple. Sir Andrew Green said the taxpayer was 'subsidising' the wages of many low paid migrants from the ex-Eastern Bloc, who have had access to the UK jobs market since 2004. Pictured are Polish economic migrants leaving for Britain that year . According to official figures, around 25 per cent of Poles and other Eastern Europeans are earning the minimum wage or less. Only 4.5 per cent pay the higher 40p rate of tax, compared to 15 per cent of the UK population as a whole. The tax credit system, largely engineered by Gordon Brown, tops up the wages of the lower paid. It benefits British workers in the exact same way as people from overseas. But Migration Watch said that the figures blew a hole in claims that mass migration is good for the economy because of the taxes paid by foreign workers. Chairman Sir Andrew Green said the taxpayer was ‘subsidising’ the wages of many low paid migrants from the ex-Eastern Bloc, who have had unrestricted access to the UK’s jobs market since 2004. He added: ‘No wonder then that employers are in favour of them and that so many people find the UK such an attractive destination. Migration Watch said the figures blew a hole in claims that mass migration is good for the economy because of the taxes paid by foreign workers . ‘We constantly hear that immigrants work hard and pay their taxes. ‘There is no doubt that many of these people do work hard but it is a fact that those on the minimum wage pay virtually no direct taxes and, if in a couple, they can receive significant sums in tax credits and other benefits. ‘Recent claims that EU migrants make a “very sizeable” contribution to the Exchequer have simply not taken into account that the low incomes of so many mean that they receive much more in means-tested benefits than they pay in tax.’ Last month, Migration watch predicted immigration from the EU will add an annual 130,000 to the UK’s population - equivalent of a new city the size of Manchester to the UK’s population every four years. The total include 50,000 Romanians and Bulgarians and 40,000 people from Poland and the seven other Eastern European nations which joined the EU in 2004. A single worker on the minimum wage in the UK would be able to earn four and a half times that which they could earn in Romania . The remainder are expected to come from the so-called ‘old’ EU - including large numbers from Greece, Spain and Italy fleeing the eurozone disaster. The campaign group said one of the major pull-factors to the UK was the generous system of in-work benefits, such as tax credits. Sir Andrew said ministers should consider denying migrants access to in-work benefits and tax credits for the first five years they are here. Under the current regime, a single worker on the minimum wage in the UK would be able to earn four and a half times that which they could earn in Romania. For a family, this rises to nine times. Any attempt to treat EU migrants differently to British citizens, who receive the same level of tax credits and other benefits, would spark a huge row with Brussels. The European Commission is already dragging Westminster to court over the so-called ‘right to reside’ test. Earlier this month, statisticians admitted a “substantial” number of Eastern European migrants arriving in Britain in the last decade were not counted. Net migration in the UK between 2001 and 2011 was 346,000 higher than previously thought as a result of 'inadequate sampling' of arrivals into the country, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said. An earlier version of this article reported claims from Migration Watch that 150,000 Eastern European migrants with no partners or children who are earning the minimum wage paid just £1 a week in net tax, including National Insurance. In fact, other statistics in the report show that, of this number, childless couples will in fact pay more. All of the workers contribute to the Exchequer through VAT and other indirect taxes. We have now amended the article accordingly.","Migration Watch says if migrants have a non-working partner and child it costs the taxpayer money to support them .
Around 25 per cent of Poles and Eastern Europeans earn minimum wage .
Only 4.5 per cent pay 40p tax rate, compared with 15 per cent of population ."
"Both teenage girls who were filmed brawling in a now-infamous 'shovel fight' video have been arrested and charged with disorderly conduct. Emily Olinger and Miranda Fugate, both 14 years old, were fighting over a boy in Olinger's yard in Miami County, Ohio, when Olinger threw a shovel at Fugate, which it her in the head and knocked her to the ground. The entire incident was filmed by a friend and uploaded online. The video became an online sensation - gaining hundreds of thousands of views on social media.

Arrested: Police have arrested Emily Olinger, the girl who threw the shovel (left), and Miranda Fugate, the girl who got hit with the shovel, for disorderly conduct . 'If you start hitting people in the head with a shovel, it can lead to death,' Major Steve Lord of the Miami County Sheriff's Office told WHIO-TV. Notably, Olinger - who admitted to WHIO that she threw the shovel - faces the same charges as Fugate. The girls told the TV station that the fight had been brewing for a long time - and that it was over a boy. Olinger said she felt justified in throwing the shovel. ''I told her to leave again, and she refused, so then the first thing I saw was my shovel. I picked it up and then she said, ""OK, OK"" and by the time she said she was done, I already hit her with it,' the teen told WHIO. 'I've been bullied ever since I was in the fourth grade, and that's why I hit her with the shovel because I'm tired of it.'

The video quickly spread through all channels of social media, which Fugate stepping forward to identify herself as 'Shovel Girl' As the video quickly spread online, with some dubbing it 'the best fight ever', an obviously-fake news story that Fugate had died as a result of the hit proliferated just as fast. 'Miranda Fugate died of serious head injuries after being hit with a shovel in the head by an old friend of hers named Emily Powers,' the story, which first appeared on curious website Huzlers, said. 'At first, It only seemed like a minor head injury as Miranda also temporarily lost one ear's hearing. 'Suddenly, while watching Mean Girls at home that same day, Miranda collapsed and died instantly. 'Doctors are saying she died of severe head trauma.' Fugate soon took to Twitter to announce she was alive and well, posting: 'I'M THE GIRL that got hit in the head with the shovel lol ... ya'll made me famous for getting hurt LMAO.' Online murmurings said the scuffle started 'over a boy'.

'I think I just broke my hand with your face, dude,' Fugate says at one point. 'I got a hard a-- head,' Powers replies. 'I can tell,' Fugate hits back. After the fiery red-head gets knocked down, she scurries away to a nearby bush with her friends, saying she can't hear out of one ear. 'I beat her a-- though, so it's OK,' Fugate says, with the video cutting shortly after. Earlier: The girls square up toward the start of their multiple-round fight .

"Officers investigating the disappearance of Madeleine McCann are hunting a British paedophile who was in Portugal when a series of sex attacks linked to the case took place, it has been reported. Roderick Robinson, 77, was arrested at a campsite in the Algarve in 2010 and extradited to Australia - where he was wanted for the 1998 rape of an eight-year-old. He escaped to the Far East following another conviction in the UK in 2012. Now it is believed that police think he may have evidence about a suspected paedophile ring that operated in the region where the three-year-old went missing in 2007. Briton Roderick Robinson when he was arrested in Pattaya, Thailand. Police reportedly want to speak to him in relation to a suspected paedophile gang in the Algarve which could be related to the disappearance of Madeleine McCann . Missing: Madeleine McCann went missing in 2007, during a family holiday in Portugal. Police reportedly want to talk to a paedophile who may be connected to a suspected paedophile ring in the region she disappeared . The British citizen was arrested at an Olhao campsite, where he had been staying for two months. He had spent the last decade on the run. At the time of the arrest, the Portuguese police said they had no evidence suggesting that the man had committed any crimes in Portugal but investigated his time in the Algarve and the reasons that brought him to the region. 'Roderick Robinson is a ­notorious and dangerous sex offender. He has shown a pattern of disturbing behaviour ­wherever he has travelled,' a source told the Sunday Mirror. 'He may have vital information which could shed light on the mystery surrounding the disappearance of Madeleine McCann. 'He is wanted on an international arrest warrant after failing to notify British police of his whereabouts and it is vital he is found without delay.' Scene: Madeleine went missing from a holiday apartment at the Ocean Club resort (pictured) in Praia da Luz as her parents dined at a nearby tapas restaurant. She had been left in the apartment with her twin siblings . Possible sighting: A street in the Praia Da Luz resort where an Irish holiday maker and his wife claim they saw a mystery person with a child at about the same time as Madeleine McCann disappeared in May 2007 . Robinson received six months in prison after accepting a plea deal for indecently assaulting the child in Australia and fled to Thailand after he was released, but Thai authorities deported him back to the UK when they found out about his past. He settled in Brighton, East Sussex, but, despite being made to sign the Sex Offenders Register, was convicted of molesting two girls, five and seven in 2012. He received a year-long sentence but it was suspended for two years. He changed his name and fled to the Far East soon after. A Scotland Yard spokesman said they do not comment on ongoing investigations. Madeleine, then aged three, went missing on May 3, 2007, from a holiday apartment in Praia da Luz, Portugal, as her parents Kate and Gerry dined at a nearby tapas restaurant. The toddler, who lived in Rothley with her family, had been left in the rented apartment at the seaside Ocean Club resort, along with her siblings, twins Sean and Amelie. The toddler, who lived in Rothley with her family, had been left in the rented apartment at the seaside Ocean Club resort . Last month Scotland Yard announced that a paedophile suspected of abducting Madeleine McCann had been linked with attacks on another five British girls. They include a ten-year-old who was sexually assaulted in Praia da Luz two years before three-year-old Madeleine vanished from the resort in the Algarve, British police revealed yesterday. The attack took place in the ‘heart of the resort’ in 2005 but the victim, now thought to be 19, did not tell her parents at the time. She only came forward following an appeal by Scotland Yard last month about a lone sex offender already thought to have targeted 12 British families holidaying in the region between 2004 and 2010. Their apartments were broken into and five young girls were assaulted in their beds by a predator who police believe may be a local binman described as ‘smelly and pot-bellied’. Since the appeal six other British families have come forward to report that their children aged six to 12 fell victim to the offender over the same period. Five of those children – including the ten-year-old molested in Praia da Luz – were sexually assaulted and there was one ‘near miss’ when the intruder was disturbed in neighbouring resorts. Police have received 500 calls about the mystery man said to have ‘a vile interest in young, white, female children’. Meanwhile, the parents . of missing Madeleine McCann thanked the public for their unwavering . support yesterday as they marked the seventh anniversary of their daughter's . disappearance. Kate . and Gerry McCann were joined by around 100 well-wishers, friends and . relatives at a prayer service in the centre of Rothley, Leicestershire. The . open-air service, conducted beside Rothley's War Memorial, saw candles . lit for all the children around the world who have been taken away from . their parents against their will. Speech: During the ceremony, Mrs McCann gave a reading adapted from the words of a song. 'Here we are again, and more significantly, here you are again,' she said. 'Having your support has made a huge difference' Prayer: The service, conducted beside Rothley's War Memorial, saw candles lit for all the children around the world who have been taken away from their parents against their will. Above, tributes to the missing children . Speaking . earlier this week, Mrs McCann revealed that she privately returns to . the Portuguese resort where her daughter disappeared to 'walk those . streets' and 'look for answers'. She told . the BBC that she returns quietly to Praia da Luz at least once or twice a . year to feel close to her eldest daughter, who would now be 10 years . old. Mrs . McCann's comments came as she backed a revamped alert system, known as . Child Rescue Alerts, which is triggered when missing children are . kidnapped or their lives are at risk. 'When a child is abducted, families are devastated and entire communities are torn apart,' she said. 'The agony of not knowing where your child is is almost impossible to imagine.' She urged members of the public to sign up for system, which will be overhauled later this month.

"Kelly Hofer has been a photographer since age 11 - a remarkable fact considering his craft is considered sinful in the remote Hutterite colony where he grew up in Manitoba, Canada. 'I think it’s based off the bible verse ""thou shalt make no graven image."" But I personally think they've taken it out of context.' Mr Hofer told MailOnline. 'I was always told it’s sinful. And it’s frowned upon as well.' Mr Hofer was forced to leave his family and his people two years ago at age 19 to pursue his love of photography, but before he left he captures some of the first intimate images inside a conservative Christian sect that is closed off from the outside world. His pictures of the Green Acres Colony are a loving depiction of life in a small community that is struggling to embrace new technology while sticking to the traditional religious principles of leading a simple, communal life. Scroll down for video . A simple life: Kelly Hofer spent nearly all his life documenting life inside the Hutterite commune where he grew up - a place where photography is considered a sin . Outcast: Far from being welcomed, Hofer found that many of his friends and neighbors - especially the older members of his community - were not pleased to be the subject of photographs . Tender: Hofer's images show the gentle, caring nature of his Hutterite community . The Hutterites are a people in transition. They believe in living a simple, peaceful communal life - but are adopting some modern technology, as well . Hofer's images offer an intimacy of daily life in a Hutterite commune that has never been seen before - because he was one of them . Hofer says his Hutterite commune was the best place to grow up. 'It's a carefree childhood - running in the woods, swimming in rivers. It's irreplaceable,' he told MailOnline . The Hutterites, like other Anabaptist like the Amish and Mennonites, form tight-knit communities that are largely based on farming. Unlike they Amish, many Hutterites embrace technology - if only in a limited capacity. Every home is wired with the internet - but mostly to allow children to connect with Hutterite schoolteachers in other communes hundreds of miles away. Cameras are allowed, but only to document progress on work or building construction. Mr Hofer is entirely self-taught. He fell in love with the craft when he picked up a point-and-shoot camera that his father, the school principal in his community of 110 people, had taken home. 'Being the only Hutterite photographer at the time, no one else in the colony knew anything about photography,' he said. And the community was anything but encouraging. Hofer started taking pictures and age 11 and is entirely self-taught. There were not even books about photography in his school library . Cameras are allowed - but only to document work progress like new construction. Taking pictures of people is frowned upon - and even considered sinful . Hofer said he mainly only had problems with members of the older generation of his community. Younger Hutterites didn't object to his photography nearly as much . Hofer's work focuses on the innocence of the close-knit community. Many of his images are of children and teenages . Farm life still plays a huge role in the Hutterite community - with children and teenagers pitching in to learn the importance of hard work . Often when he began photographing his subjects - friends, neighbors and family members - they threatened to tell the minister and have his camera taken away. At one point, his camera was briefly confiscated. When he first posted his pictures online, he was called in front of the council of elders and forced to delete the images off his Flickr account in front of them. But he kept shooting, anyway, because he felt people outside of his commune needed to understand his community. Some 45,000 Hutterites live in North America - the vaster majority in western Canada and the northern Great Plains if the U.S. 'The reason why I kept doping it is they constantly had the idea that the outsiders didn't understand how Hutterites work. It's to educate the outside world. Hutterties aren’t black ad white they aren’t like the Amish,' Mr Hofer said. 'I'm still trying to educate people. You see Hutterites everywhere but nobody knows Hutterites. Most of the conversations because people want to know about Hutterites.' Hofer's subjects were all his friends, family and neighbors - his commune only has a population of 110 . Farm life: Growing food for the commune is one of the primary activities of the Hutterites in the warm months . Hofer now lives 700 miles from home in Calgary, where he is pursuing his career as a photographer - something that would have been impossible on his Hutterite commune . Hofer described his images as 'warm' and maintains a high degree of love for his community, despite having to leave . There are some 45,000 Hutterites living in North America - most of them in western Canada and the northern Great Plains of the United states . Hofer said he wanted to show the outside world what living in a Hutterite commune was like - in an attempt to help people understand his people . Beauty: Hofer, who has chosen to live in the modern world, still regards the simple beauty of Hutterite life with respect . Hofer is making a new life for himself as a photographer and working to navigate his new life in the modern world .","Kelly Hofer grew up in a Hutterite commune in rural Manitoba, Canada, and began taking pictures at age 11 .

"A teenager who took a photo of a Michael Jackson impersonator was stunned - after spotting a picture of what looks like Michael Jackson's ghost in the background. Reece Savva, 14, from Bromley, Kent, took three snaps of the Jackson tribute act as he waited in line for a signature. But when he got home and looked at the pictures he noticed what appears - sort of, if you squint - to be the ghost of the late entertainer hovering above his impersonator's head in one of the frames. The return of the king: This picture appears to show the ghostly visage of Michael Jackson (top right) checking out what his impersonator is writing . Uncanny: These photos shows the... striking... similarity between the face of the ghost and the singer . Reece went to the Churchill Theatre with his family to watch a Michael Jackson live tribute show. He said: 'It was so eerie. There was nothing there at all when I was waiting in line. 'I have no idea what happened on that one picture, but it’s terrifying. It was like something out of Thriller. 'It’s like he just popped his head in to see what was going on and then left. I never used to believe in ghosts, but now I’m not so sure.' His mother Angela, 54, added: 'The image is so clear. I was there and I can adamantly say that there were no mirrors, no trickery, nothing like that at all.

'Sometimes you can see these things in photos, it is an image of something but you are almost willing it to be something else. 'But you look at that and it is clearly a face and it does look like Michael Jackson. And the fact it was a Michael Jackson event and there he was makes it all the more eerie. 'Although, I think if he did come back from the dead, he probably wouldn’t go to watch an impersonator.'

"More than 64,000 operations in NHS hospitals in England were cancelled last year - the highest figure for a decade. New figures show that 64,192 planned operations were scrapped at the last minute in 2013/14 - none of them for clinical reasons. The next highest annual total of cancelled procedures was 68,569 in 2004/05. Andy Burnham has accused David Cameron of being 'shockingly complacent' about the NHS . Other figures from NHS England show that the NHS missed the four hour waiting time target for A&E units. Waiting times were worst in major A&E wards where just 92.2 per cent of patients were seen within four hours. Data for all emergency departments, including minor injuries units and urgent care centres, shows they also narrowly failed to meet the 95 per cent target, with 94.9 per cent seen in four hours. Andy Burnham MP, Labour’s Shadow Health Secretary, said ‘David Cameron was boasting about the performance of the NHS this week, but these figures show he is shockingly complacent and completely out of touch with what is happening on the frontline. There were 64,192 planned operations cancelled in 2013/14 none of them for clinical reasons . ‘It’s getting harder to see a GP, tens of thousands of operations have been cancelled and we’ve just had the worst year in A&E for a decade with almost a million patients waiting longer than four hours. ‘There’s only one person to blame for the crisis in our NHS and that’s David Cameron.

"[headerlinks . He is under pressure to hand back his OBE and faces repaying a  fortune to the taxman. But Gary Barlow can at least contemplate his misfortune in comfort – as he owns a portfolio of luxury homes worth at least £20million. The Take That star, his manager Jonathan Wild and bandmates Howard Donald and Mark Owen were found last week to have poured £66million into a massive tax avoidance scheme. In the Commons today, Prime Minister David Cameron condemned tax avoidance schemes and in a reference to the Take That hit said he want the 'money back for good'. Scroll down for video .

However, an analysis of Barlow’s property dealings reveals the 43-year-old has plenty to fall back on. In 1995, as Take That were achieving international stardom, he bought Delamere Manor Estate in Cheshire for £1million. He went on to more than quadruple his money when it sold for £4.7million in 2005. New owners Alan Murtagh and Michelle Stubbs later revealed that Barlow whisked them away to watch Take That perform in concert in Dublin with exclusive backstage passes when they were considering buying the huge estate. Barlow moved his family into a luxury Georgian townhouse in Kensington, West London. It was sold to an investment banker with ties to an exclusive interior decorating firm for £6.85million in 2010.

More well-known stars have been dragged into the row over the Icebreaker tax avoidance scheme. Sports stars, businessmen and celebrities were among 1,000 people to invest in the £36million scheme. They include Olympic hurdler Colin Jackson and ex-England football manager Terry Venables, The Times reported. Last . week, a judge ruled Icebreaker Management – which styled itself as a . music industry investment scheme – was a tax shelter that helped Gary .

Supermodel Kate Moss and TV presenter Jeremy Clarkson have homes close to the village, which is in David Cameron’s constituency. The Prime Minister and Barlow struck up a friendship after the singer joined him on the campaign trail for the 2010 General Election. Mr Cameron was challenged about his links with Barlow during Prime Minister's Questions. He said: 'I couldn’t have been clearer that I condemn all of these aggressive tax avoidance schemes, and more than just condemning them, this Government has taken action - legislative action - to say to people, to coin a phrase, ""We want your money back for good"".'

"The planned documentary by the Oprah Winfrey Network on Michael Sam, the NFL's first openly gay player, has been postponed. Erik Logan, president of the network, said Friday that the postponement was made after meetings with the St. Louis Rams. 'After careful consideration and discussion with the St. Louis Rams, ""The Untitled Michael Sam Project"" has been postponed, allowing Michael the best opportunity to achieve his dream of making the team,' Logan said in a statement. Scroll down for video . In training: St Louis Rams rookie defensive Michael Sam during the NFL rookie camp Friday . From the football field to Hollywood: Michael Sam, the first openly-gay man to be drafted into the NFL, will be the star of his own reality TV show, Oprah Winfrey announced Wednesday . Cameras are rolling: The show has reportedly already started filming and crews were in the room when Sam got the call that he had been drafted and kissed his boyfriend in celebration . From the people that brought you 'Lindsay': The documentary series is being filmed by the same crew that followed Lindsay Lohan for her OWN reality show . The first openly gay football player to be selected in the draft was to be the focus of a new multi-part documentary series to air on Oprah's OWN network, produced by the same crew that filmed Lindsay Lohan's reality show. 'We are honored that Michael is trusting us with his private journey in this moment that has not only made history but will shape it forever,' Oprah Winfrey said in a statement. 'It's clear that we, along with the world, recognize the important opportunity that Michael now has in this moment. We will continue to support him in his journey to earn a spot playing for the Rams.' As a seventh-round draft pick, Sam will face hefty challenges just to make the Rams. Being the subject of a TV documentary could have been a major distraction for the defensive end from Missouri. Spotlight: Sam and his boyfriend Vito Cammisano celebrated his drafting in Las Vegas this weekend. He has since flown to St Louis to begin training. It's unclear how much access the crews will be granted by the NFL or Rams . Hard road ahead: During his time at the University of Missouri, Sam was named SEC Defensive Player of the Year, but will likely have to train for a different position if he wants to make the Rams 53-man roster . 'This (postponement) will allow for . Michael to have a total focus on football, and will ensure no . distractions to his teammates,' added Sam's agent, Cameron Weiss. 'Everybody involved remains committed to this project and understands . its historical importance as well as its positive message.' The . announcement that Sam was to participate in the show was somewhat . surprising to some, since Sam said at a press conference that he just . wants to focus on training. When asked what it felt like to the the first openly gay draftee, Sam said simply: 'I guess it's great.' 'I'm determined to be great so I'm going to train hard and try and make the team,' he added. Shooting . had reportedly already begun on the project, but it's uncertain how . much access the NFL and Rams would grant production crews now that Sam . is in training. Sam was . named SEC Defensive Player of the Year during his time at the University . of Missouri, but is considered too small to be a defensive end in the . league at six-foot-two and 261 pounds.

Mr Huxley, who ran his own pontoon building business, had spent his last day at an engagement party and was seen at his local hotel, the Oaks, around 1.30am. Detectives later studied security footage of a street near his flat and found footage of him at an intersection in conversation with man wearing chef's trousers. A month later, detectives arrested Kelsall and charged him with murder. they later added two more charges of possessing child abuse images on his laptop computer.

"Four Britons are feared dead after the yacht they were sailing from the Caribbean back to the UK capsized in the Atlantic Ocean. The crew of the 40ft yacht were returning from one of the world’s most prestigious regattas when they went missing in treacherous conditions. They were last heard from on Friday morning, when water had started to leak into the boat in 20ft stormy seas. After a two-day search operation, rescuers yesterday gave up hope of finding them. Andrew Bridge, 21, James Male, 23, Steve Warren, 52, and Paul Goslin, 56, had been sailing the Cheeki Rafiki, a Beneteau performance racer yacht, back from the Antigua Sailing Week regatta. Skipper Andrew Bridge, 21, from Farnham, Surrey, is one of the four . sailors who are missing at sea after their yacht Cheeki Rafiki is . believed to have capsized . Crew members Paul Goslin, 56, left, and Steve Warren, 52, right, both from Somerset, were sailing back to the UK on the 40ft yacht after spending about ten days at Antigua Sailing Week, one of the world's top regattas . James Male, 23, from Southampton, was another sailor on board the yacht, which lost contact with charter firm Stormforce Coaching on Friday morning . Last night the men were described as ‘very experienced offshore yachtsmen’ and friends and family were understood to be ‘devastated’ the search for them had been called off so soon. The yacht ran into difficulties some 620 miles east of Cape Cod in Massachusetts last Thursday. Contact was lost in the early hours of Friday morning after the crew radioed they they were taking on water and were diverting to the Azores. US and Canadian aircraft and merchant vessels searched throughout Friday and Saturday but the operation was called off yesterday. On Saturday a container ship discovered an overturned hull that matched the description of the Cheeki Rafiki but there was no sign of the crew, so the vessel was not inspected. The four men were sailing the Cheeki Rafiki back to the UK for Southampton-based yacht training and charter company Stormforce Coaching. The US Coastguard were contacted by the yacht’s managers in Falmouth, Cornwall, on Friday. Two personal locator beacons registered to the yacht had been activated, but they have since stopped transmitting signals. A coastguard spokesman said: ‘We searched with multiple assets over 4,000 square miles for pings from the vessel’s personal locator beacons. After receiving no more transmissions we believe that we would have found them by now if we were going to find them. ‘These beacons are small devices and the ones being used have a very short battery life.’ US and Canadian aircraft and merchant vessels looked for the crew throughout Friday and Saturday but later called off the search. Stormforce director Doug Innes said he was 'devastated' the search had been stopped . Weather conditions in the area were described as treacherous, with winds in excess of 50 knots, waves of 15 to 20ft and visibility reduced to under a mile. Mr Bridge, who is from Farnham in Surrey, was being paid by Stormforce to captain the yacht. His aunt Georgina told Sky News: ‘Obviously the family are really concerned that the search has been suspended and we are really hoping that it will be resumed. ‘We are holding out great hope that Andrew and the guys on board Cheeki Rafiki will be found. We are hopeful they were able to launch a liferaft, so we would really like the search to be resumed.’ Miss Bridge explained that all four men were ‘very experienced sailors’, adding: ‘Andrew has been sailing since he was a small child. ‘He is a very experienced captain and has sailed Cheeki Rafiki a great deal. Sailing is his passion and we just want him home.’ Treacherous: Search teams battled 'treacherous' conditions - including winds in excess of 50 knots and 15 to 20 ft waves -  to search for the missing yacht, pictured . 'Mr Goslin, from West Camel, Mr Warren, from Bridgwater, both in Somerset, and Mr Male, of Southampton, were described as ‘very experienced offshore yachtsmen’. Stormforce director Doug Innes said: ‘We are devastated the search has now been called off so soon. ‘Our thoughts are with the four yachtsmen and their families and we hope and pray for them all.’ US coastguard Robert Simpson said the search had been hampered by storms in the Atlantic. Too late: A spokesman for the US coastguard said he believes the search teams would have found the sailors by now if they were going to find them at all . ‘The conditions are very bad and getting . worse,’ he said. ‘The search area is too vast to continue. The case is . not yet closed, but there are no plans to resume the search. We had . hoped we would find them. Sadly, that has not happened.’ Craig Burton, from the Royal Yachting Association, said the crew was ‘very, very experienced’. He said: ‘The skipper, Andy, has done numerous ocean crossings, he’s a very experienced guy.’ Yachting experts expressed concern that the hull of the yacht had been found but not inspected. Andrew . Pindar, of the GAC Pindar racing team, said: ‘The fear with yachts . upside down is that people could be trapped inside them.’","The crew of the Cheeki Rafiki were returning from Antigua Sailing Week .

He received 1.5 million Chinese Yuan (£142,000) in compensation from the Chinese government after spending nearly two decades in prison for a crime he did not commit . On that night his room-mate at a hostel for farm workers in Baotou, Li Yanming, raped and killed a girl he had brought back to their room. At first, . Li threatened to kill Mr Wang if he reported the crime to police, and when . he refused he knelt down and cried to beg Wang to keep it secret - to . which Mr Wang agreed. But his friend disposed of the body and then fled, leaving Mr Wang in the frame for the crime. Mr Wang was sentenced to jail for rape and murder, narrowly escaping a death sentence in November 1996.

He spent his time in a brutal prison where he ate bad food, did forced labour and expected to die behind bars, never seeing his family again . He spent his time in a brutal prison where he ate bad food, did forced labour and expected to die behind bars, never seeing his family again in Baotou city in north China's Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. He never stopped pleading his innocence but said: 'I resigned myself to prison life. I resigned myself to dying in jail.'

"Music teacher Helen Smith, 42, is accused of setting up fake piano exams at her home in Stadbroke, Sheffield . A music teacher arranged for students to take sham piano exams in front of a phoney  official, a court heard. Helen Smith held the examinations at her home and five pupils paid their fees and took the tests believing them to be genuine. They were told later they had passed with either a merit or distinction, it was alleged. But some became suspicious when certificates failed to arrive and the examining board told them there was no record of any test being carried out. The combined cost of all the exam fees and additional lessons was around £1,600, Sheffield Magistrates’ Court was told. Smith, 42, denied six counts of fraud by abuse of position and one of fraud by false representation between February 2012 and March this year. Two adults and three teenagers had to play their test pieces before an unknown woman enlisted by Smith who claimed to be approved by the Associated Board of the Royal Schools of Music, it was alleged. Prosecutor David Godfrey said: ‘The defendant arranged for a fake examiner to attend and took considerable efforts to give it the appearance of an official examination.’ Student Andrea Jackson said she was elated when told by her teacher shortly after the Grade 5 exam on December 15, 2012, that she had passed with a distinction. When no certificate arrived she called the ABRSM, which had no record of an exam on that day. ‘I was very upset,’ Miss Jackson said. ‘I felt the rug had been pulled from under my feet.’ Sheffield Magistrates' Court was told the combined cost of all the exam fees and additional piano lessons was around £1,600 . When she raised the matter with Smith she was told she had broken data protection laws by asking the ABRSM for information. The court heard the board sent a cheque for £264.90 to Smith for cancelled exams which was cashed in July 2012. It included a full refund for an exam due to have been taken by Miss Jackson. Lynne Butler, of the ABRSM, said Smith told the board the reason for Miss Jackson cancelling was that her father had died, which turned out to be false. Sharon Copley, the mother of a teenage pupil, was told to attend Smith’s house in Sheffield for a Grade 5 piano exam instead of another official exam they had booked. Mrs Copley said her daughter was devastated to discover the exam was not genuine. She said: ‘To be told by somebody you trusted that you have passed with a distinction and to then find out the person she looked up to hadn’t told the truth, she felt humiliated and let down. It knocked her for six.’ Smith claimed she had arranged the exams in good faith with the ABRSM and blamed an administrative error for the lack of accurate records. She said she thought the woman was an official examiner. ‘I feel very hurt and betrayed and let down by the board’s inaccuracies or whatever has happened,’ she told the court. ‘I did my job as a music teacher to make sure they took their exams.’ The court heard that Smith, who represented herself, had previously been banned from teaching in schools for two years by the  General Teaching Council after claiming sick pay while being  on holiday. Judgement was reserved to a later date. Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","Helen Smith, 42, from Sheffield, accused of hosting fake exams for students .

"A 38-year-old man killed in an execution style shooting in Melbourne knew he was in danger in the week leading up to his murder, neighbours say. The father of three was shot at point-blank range in the chest at around 11pm on Saturday as he was at the house with other business associates. The man, whose first name is Adrian and who is believed to be of Maltese origin, installed security cameras in the home he shared in the northern Melbourne suburb of Epping where his wife and three young children lived nine days before the shooting. Death threats: the 38-year-old man shot dead at point blank range at the home he shared with his young family in Melbourne had hidden inside the house earlier in the day when a knocked banged on his door brandishing a piece of wood and issuing death threats . Just hours before the shooting, he hid inside the house with others as a man banged on his door with a piece of wood threatening to kill him . 'I saw a man holding a bat or plank of wood, screaming ""someone is going to die"",' one neighbour told the Herald Sun. Another told the MailOnline the man was calling out the man's name. 'Obviously Adrian didn't come out and he didn't ring police,' the neighbour said. 'I believe he was expecting trouble. He'd been living in the neighbourhood with his wife and kids for so long and then suddenly he put in CCTV.' Following the threats, the man called friends or associates over to the house where they remained until the shooting. Six shots were fired into a vehicle and the house from at least two different firearms. Neighbour Debbie Tuckerman, who is a registered nurse, said after the second shot rang out she phoned police who arrived within seven minutes. 'It was quite scary,' Mrs Tuckerman said, 'there were these guys pleading for help, saying 'we don't know what to do, please help"", but I didn't know whether the shooter was still around.' Mrs Tuckerman waited until she saw the first police car arrived and a woman police officer step out. 'I told her, ""I'm a nurse"" and I went in.' She ran to the home to find the man lying in a pool of blood and his wife beside him. 'She was screaming, ""he is going to die"",' Ms Tuckerman said. 'Adrian had bullet wounds to the right of his chest and there was a lot of blood. I applied CPR, but I couldn't find a pulse.' Police found a second man with non-life threatening leg injuries. It is believed five men fled on foot after the shooting. Neighbours described the house as very busy, with a lot of 'comings and goings'.","Man, 38, killed in execution style shooting in Melbourne suburb .

"Fear of dementia is causing hundreds of thousands of sufferers to delay seeking treatment for the illness. A survey has found that more than half of patients admit putting off seeing a doctor for at least six months after noticing symptoms. Fifty-two per cent of the estimated 800,000 people suffering from the condition in the UK are yet to receive a diagnosis, according to the Alzheimer’s Society. Amanda Holden is supporting the Dementia Friends campaign to help highlight that people with the condition can still live fulfilling and rewarding lives . Research involving 1,043 patients showed 41 per cent said they had kept concerns about dementia bottled up – mainly because they feared upsetting family or they did not want to face the reality of the condition. The high numbers who are failing to talk about the condition has added to these difficulties, the charity said. The study for the Alzheimer’s Society, conducted online, showed 54 per cent had waited for six months or more after first noticing symptoms of dementia in themselves or someone close to them before seeking professional help. Jeremy Hughes, chief executive of the Alzheimer’s Society, said: ‘One in three people over the age of 65 will develop dementia, so it is worrying that so many people would feel reluctant to seek help about it. ‘The Dementia Friends programme has put dementia back in the spotlight but the fact remains that thousands of people remain in denial about the condition. Talking about dementia can be difficult and we all bury our heads in the sand from time to time. Health Secretary, Jeremy Hunt, pictured, has described dementia as a 'one of the most significant healthcare issues we face in the country' 'But the sooner you know what you are dealing with, the sooner you can feel in control again and get on with your life.’ The findings have been released in Dementia Awareness Week. A separate YouGov poll of 2,358 adults found dementia is the condition people are most reluctant to seek help for, compared with other health issues including serious heart and digestive problems. Fifty-seven per cent of adults who have had a health problem in the past year have put off seeking help about it, nearly half of them because they thought they would be ‘making a fuss’. Twenty-three per cent of those who had put off seeking help said it was because they feared it was a serious health problem, such as dementia. Jeremy Hunt, the Health Secretary, told the Telegraph: ‘Dementia is a growing, global challenge and one of the most significant healthcare issues we face in the country. ‘The Government is determined to tackle this head on, but we also need as a whole society to respond to the disease.’ A host of celebrities – including Amanda Holden, Chris Martin, Lily Allen and Alesha Dixon – are starring in an advert aimed at encouraging people to join the ‘Dementia Friends’ campaign. Also involved is author Sir Terry Pratchett, who suffers from Alzheimer’s disease himself.","More than half of 800,000 dementia sufferers yet to receive a diagnosis .
