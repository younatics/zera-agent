"They are considered the world's greatest natural and man-made wonders attracting millions of awe-inspired tourists from around the world every year. But many discerning members of TripAdvisor were less than impressed, giving Christ the Redeemer, the Grand Canyon, Niagara Falls and many other sites one-star reviews. One said the statue in Rio de Janeiro was 'just a pillar' and described it as 'a pathetic and shoddy piece of concrete'. In a review warning people not to bother with the Grand Canyon, it is described as an 'overblown sandy ditch' by a disgruntled visitor who wished he'd 'stayed in my hotel room and watched a DVD instead'. Scroll down for video . Grand Canyon: The natural wonder of the world in Arizona did not impress everyone, receiving a number of one-star reviews including one which called it an 'overblown sandy ditch' and saying 'nature is c***' Christ the Redeemer: This Rio attraction was called 'over-rated' and just a 'concrete pillar' in one-star reviews . The beautiful Niagara Falls - on the border of the United States and Canada - was branded a 'dump' and the 'pits' ruined by 'litter louts'. One said: 'Niagara falls is boring and quite possibly the most boring thing you could do. Also it's so expensive you should take that money and stay at a Ritz-Carlton for the night. And don't take the boat. It lasts for 10 minutes and you wait for 3 hours'. Another said: 'Niagara is the pits everywhere I looked litter over flowing from buckets .People were just dropping stuff everywhere'. Across North America in San Francisco, there are several complaints about the city's famous Golden Gate Bridge. One couple were 'unhappy' saying that its 'colour was not as advertised' and another reviewer called it 'pointless visiting' say that people should 'buy a postcard instead'. Tourists were also disappointed with the Great Sphinx at Giza in Egypt, with several complaining it was 'tiny' and one upset holidaymaker saying it was 'covered in litter and next to McDonalds'. The Sphinx and the Pyramids: Tourists called the Sphinx 'tiny' and surrounded by 'scum of the earth'. Visitors to the Pyramids said it was just camels and Brits in leggings . Another one-star review said it was 'surrounded' by 'scum of the earth who will steal from you and harass you from the moment you arrive until all you want to do is leave'. Meanwhile one reviewer criticised the nearby Pyramids of Giza, calling his experience 'horrendous'. He wrote: 'The pyramids are nice to look at and are definitely something to see, however that is if you can see past the dying/dead horses and dogs, and people harassing you for money on camels, coupled with overweight brits wearing see through leggings.' Britain's Stonehenge was called 'just a bunch of stones in a field' that keeps visitors interested for 'a second or two'. One visitor to Hadrian's Wall asked: 'Where's the wall?' and said anyone thinking of going shouldn't bother and head to Italy instead for 'better ruins, better weather and better food'. Another said people would have 'more fun at a funeral' than at Hadrian's Wall. Big Ben did not fare any better in the scathing reviews with some observant reviewers calling it 'just a big clock.' Eiffel Tower: The Paris landmark was written off as an 'ugly waste of time' set in one of the world's dirtiest cities . One reviewer wrote: 'Its just a big clock and the whole experience left me unsettled' while a reviewer gave it a one-star review because  he 'couldn't see Big Ben anywhere'. Another British attraction slapped with a one star rating is the Angel of the North in Gateshead which was dubbed as 'RUSTY JUNK' and an 'horrendous item' that 'looks like an aeroplane that has been upended and planted cockpit first'. The British Museum, home to the Elgin Marbles and the Rosetta Stone, was also dealt a blow with visitors scoring it one star and branding it 'coma inducing'. A London reviewer said: 'I'm really sorry, but I just don't see the lure to this museum. My son and I really tried to like the exhibits but it was just so so boring.' While another reviewer complained there wasn't much British about it and said: 'Sorry, but it would be empty without the Greeks and Egyptians.' Niagara Falls: The great North American waterfall was branded a 'dump' and the 'pits' ruined by 'litter louts' surrounded by 'rip-off' shops . Golden Gate Bridge: Unimpressed visitors to San Francisco said it was the wrong colour while another said it was just foggy and people should just buy a postcard instead . The royal residence of Buckingham Palace was slammed by one reviewer as a 'quintessential tourist trap'. The Colosseum in Rome earned a one star rating due to one visitor considering it 'nothing special'. A Liverpool reviewer warned tourists off visiting the Eiffel Tower in Paris saying 'don't go'. While a Newcastle reviewer said: 'The Eiffel tower is an ugly tower made popular by contemporary media, it is nothing really, but a waste of time to visit.' Hadrian's Wall: One visitor said it is 'more fun at a funeral' and 'full of weirdos' and another asked: 'Where's the wall?' Stonehenge: The ancient stones in rural Britain are just 'big bits of stone in a big field' and another said they would 'do anything' to get the time spent there back . The Sistine Chapel has not escaped its share of bad reviews with one man saying he was 'pushed through like cattle by security who bellow out 'silenzio' and 'sssh' and patrol for those taking photos! Horrible.' Whereas another reviewer told his fellow tourists 'don't go inside' the Taj Mahal. Another reviewer warned tourists to avoid Times Square 'like the plague' and called it 'an incredible assault on your senses.'","TripAdvisor users rip in to some of world's best loved tourist attractions .

"Technology teacher: Michael Rankin, 54, allegedly made outrageous remarks to schoolchildren . A teacher who allegedly told a pupil 'I s****** your mum' is facing a ban from the classroom. Michael Rankin, 54, is also accused of telling the pupil: ‘Every time I s*** your mum she makes me a sandwich, that’s why I’m fat.’ The former technology teacher at Ardrossan Academy in North Ayrshire faces allegations that he made outrageous remarks to children. Mr Rankin is said to have told another pupil: ‘I need to put my glasses on, I can’t see because of too much w****** - is that why you wear glasses? Is that what happened to you?’ Other claims include referring to a child as ‘Shrek’ after the ogre in the films, and asking another ‘How many pies you had today?’. Mr Rankin is due to appear at a disciplinary hearing before the General Teaching Council for Scotland next week. At an earlier hearing, a lawyer for Mr Rankin said he did not accept all of the allegations against him but did not intend to contest them. According to the charges, which relate to the period from August 2012 to June 2013, Mr Rankin and a class watched the 2002 film Bend it like Beckham in which a car is shown bouncing up and down. The teacher is said to have told a pupil: ‘That’s me and your mum in the back.’ School: Mr Rankin worked at Ardrossan Academy (pictured) in North Ayrshire. He allegedly told a pupil: 'You can give this present of a mirror to you mum but I already gave her a present last night' The same pupil accused him of saying: ‘You can give this present of a mirror to you mum but I already gave her a present last night.’ He allegedly shouted insults at various pupils - as young as 13 - including ‘You wee b******’, ‘Shut up you wee a*******’ and ‘You’re f****** worthless’. He is accused of referring to pupils from another school as ‘idiots’ and ‘Cumnock mongos’ during a football match against Cumnock Academy 30 miles away - and telling pupils not to tell anyone because the team would be disbanded and that they ‘would not be believed’. A North Ayrshire Council spokesman said: ‘This person is a former employee whose employment was terminated in October 2013. ‘As the individual is no longer an employee of the council it would be inappropriate to comment further.’","Michael Rankin, 54, worked at Ardrossan Academy in North Ayrshire .

"A grand mansion linked to Henry VIII has been turned into a block of luxury flats fit for a king - and for under £200,000 each. Preston Hall, a magnificent 55,000 sq.ft. Grade II listed mansion near Aylesford, Kent, was once the country residence of the Culpeper family, ancestors of Queen Catherine Howard, the fifth wife of King Henry VIII.

However, Catherine had an affair with her distant cousin Sir Thomas Culpeper - a courtier to the King - and they were both beheaded for treason. Ownership of the hall passed through relatives of the Culpeper family until it was purchased in 1848 by Edward Ladd Betts, a railroad baron.

"Carmen Dell'Orefice, dubbed the world's oldest working supermodel, graces the cover of New You's upcoming issue, and she looks as breathtaking as ever. The 83-year-old New York-born beauty - who first covered Vogue when she was 15 and has enjoyed an illustrious career ever since - spoke frankly about everything from maintaining her model figure through seven decades in the industry, to 'preparing' for death, and still enjoying sex in her 80s. 'Of course I still have a sex life, why would I give that up?' she insists. 'Do I love to breathe? If you have a Rolls Royce and it is up on wheels, you go in with the key and every now and then turn on the motor to make sure the motor is running. So when you want to drive the car, it is all oiled and ready.' Scroll down for video . Perfect poise: Carmen Dell'Orefice, dubbed the world's oldest working supermodel, graces the cover of New You's upcoming issue, and the 83-year-old looks as breathtaking as ever . Carmen, who was born in New York to parents of Italian and Hungarian descent, has been married three times and engaged once more but doesn't mention any names in reference to her current love life. In a 2011 interview with The Telegraph, however, she said: 'There's always a boyfriend. Whatever else I have to give up on, I won't give up on love.' Asked by New You how Carmen keeps her proverbial Rolls Royce 'oiled', the stunning model responds: 'I know how to pleasure myself. 'I can go for a low romantic love, and that’s fine but I am conditioned to the whole meal.' On sex: 'If you have a Rolls Royce... you go in with the key and every now and then turn on the motor to make sure the motor is running. So when you want to drive the car, it is all oiled and ready,' she says . Speaking about why so many people 'give up' on sex later on in life, Carmen states: 'Because they never entered sex from the right doorway. 'We are told by our parents, ""don’t do that"" or ""that’s bad"" and then there is religion and the doctors who say ""oh you are over sex."" 'No - you are just under-satisfied. It should be like breathing - so natural.' Carmen also spoke to the publication about maintaining her model figure over the 70 years she has been working. 'I eat to my appetite and don’t count calories,' she says. 'I want to enjoy food passionately. I could have gotten into trouble with food in my lifetime because I love to eat but I was given a free pass because I metabolize food well.' Woman of mystery: Carmen has been married three times and engaged once more but doesn't mention any names in reference to her current love life . She does open up about her one guilty pleasure, however, admitting: 'I’ve had my issues with ice cream when I was younger. Friends will open my freezer today and say, “My God, who eats all this ice-cream?” 'It stays frozen just in case. That is my money in the bank. It gives me a feeling of security. One would think clothes would do it for me - but no, it’s ice cream.' As for the healthier end of the food spectrum, Carmen has her tricks. 'If you don’t like watery spinach learn to braise it yourself or eat it raw,' she advises. 'That is the creativity of living.' Long career: Carmen, pictured in 1955 at the age of 23 in the aisle of an airplane, says, 'when I die, it's going to be my way' On a more serious note, Carmen spoke to the publication about 'preparing for death', having just lost two friends which whom she enjoyed '60 or 70-year-long' friendships - one being model agent Eileen Ford. '[They] prepared me for dying because they knew how to live their lives,' she says. 'Most people don’t know how to live their life so they don’t know how to die. They are startled or confused by it but it is part of living. That’s why I always say, when I die it’s going to be my way.' Asked her views on the models of today, Carmen describes them as 'essentially bodies-for-hire'. She elaborated, saying: 'Short of having to go to bed with everyone, it is tough work. 'The smartest, with a good education and some good moral support from family and mentors, will not fall into booby-traps. 'They will save their money and use it and the experience as stepping stones to a more permanent career. I’m just an outsider observing but this is my impression.'

"In the aftermath of the fiery New York train crossing wreck last week, witnesses described the bravery of one unidentified man who held open the doors for passengers to flee while his own hands were on fire. They said that despite his hair and hands being ablaze the man buttressed the exit as the carriage burned inside and that when he could stand the pain no more he jumped down and shoved his hands into the snow to extinguish them. That man, Patrick Izzo, 29, is now recovering in Westchester Medical Center from second-degree burns to his hands and also injuries to his face and leg from the crash which killed six and injured 15. Scroll down for video . Hero: Patrick Izzo is pictured here by his sister as he sits up in bed and chows down on a well deserved meal of burgers, fries and a cheese board . His sister, Sally Izzo, told KHOU that her family keep telling the business entrepreneur that he is a hero, but that he modestly denies this. 'He says he did what his instincts told him to do,' said Sally. 'He's doing well. He's definitely in a lot of pain.' Pictured, sitting up in bed and indulging in his favorites of burger and fries and a cheese plate, Patrick is facing more treatment for his burns. He described to his sister the terrifying instant when the Metro-North train struck the SUV of a New York mother-of-three, who had become stuck between a railroad crossing on February 3. Proud sister: Sally Izzo, a producer on The Blaze (left with 30 Rock actress Jane Krakowski) has said she has tried to insist on calling her brother (right) a hero, but that he refuses . Sally said that her brother 'felt a big jolt' when the train hit the car and the impact was so strong he feared the train was going to derail. Acting instinctively, Patrick stood in the aisle to prepare himself but the train ignited when the third rail ripped through the car. Patrick said that in that moment he fell and then stood to find his hands, hair and his shirt were ablaze. Sally Izzo said that her brother knew he had to get off the train and with his hands burning he cracked open the emergency box with his elbow and opened the latch to get the exit doors open. He then held it open for survivors to jump out. 'He always pays attention to where the emergency boxes are,' said Sally. 'He's just one of those people.' His bravery did not end there. Once he had put his hands out he tried to shout up to other passengers on boards the train, but he couldn't do much more because of his wounds. Investigation begins: An NTSB worker on Thursday examined the burned-out shell of the Metro-North train which was involved in Tuesday's crash in Valhalla, New York . Recovery: Workers prepare for a crane to lift the crushed SUV from the front of a Metro-North commuter train last week . 'He said people had severed limbs,' said Sally Izzo. 'It was a disaster.' And yesterday, the medical examiner in New York announced that all six people killed in the railroad crossing collision died from blunt force trauma and burns. A brief statement released by Westchester County did not specify the cause of death for any of the victims. It also did not specify whether the blunt-force injuries were caused by the impact inside the train on the tracks or by the pieces of third rail that speared into both vehicles during the February 3 accident. The collision killed five men on a Metro-North evening commuter train and a mother-of-three, Ellen Brody, 49, whose Mercedes SUV was hit by the train at a grade crossing in Valhalla. In this aerial photo, personnel from various agencies work the scene of a deadly SUV and commuter train accident in Valhalla, around 30 miles from New York City . Morgan Stanley employee Aditya Tomar, 41, banker Eric Vandercar, 53, Met museum art curator Walter Liedtke, 69, research scientist Robert Dirks, 36, and Joseph B. Nadol, 42, of Ossining were also killed in the crash . A fire erupted, apparently fueled by the SUV's gasoline, and 12 sections of the railroad's electrified rail pierced the SUV and the train car. The findings were based on autopsies conducted by the office of the county medical examiner, Dr. Kunjlata Ashar, the county said. The statement said Ashar's final report and conclusions will not be completed until the National Transportation Safety Board finishes its investigation several months from now.","Patrick Izzo, 29, acted instinctively during fatal train wreck on February 3 .

"As many as 15,000 fraudulent votes helped Lutfur Rahman win re-election in Tower Hamlets last year, it was claimed in court today. The independent mayor of the east London borough faces allegations of 'electoral fraud' at the High Court, where his accusers today claimed forgery and bullying helped him at the polls. Local activist Andy Erlam, one of a group of four voters taking action against Mr Rahman, claimed police stood by as voters faced intimation in at least 40 polling stations in the borough. 'Electoral fraud': Andy Erlam, left, is leading a group of four voters taking action against Tower Hamlets Mayor Lutfur Rahman, right, alleging as many as 15,000 fraudulent votes helped his reelection last year . The group wants election commissioner Richard Mawrey - who is sitting as a judge at an Election Court trial in London - to declare the result of the May 2014 election void and order a re-run. Mr Rahman denies wrongdoing. Statistics showed that nearly 240,000 people live in the Tower Hamlets borough and the mayoral election had around 180,000 registered electors, Mr Erlam told the court. He said his 'guesstimate' was that a total of 10,000 to 15,000 votes in the combined 2014 local council and mayor elections in Tower Hamlets had been forged or affected by intimidation. He told Mr Mawrey he thought there had been 'intimidation of voters' at more than 40 polling stations. He said there was evidence that police at many, if not most, of those polling stations had either 'refused' to intervene or taken 'exceptionally ineffective measures' to stop intimidation. Previously a Labour Commons candidate in Cheltenham, Gloucestershire, and Bexleyheath, south-east London, Mr Erlam stood for election to Tower Hamlets council on an anti-corruption ticket. Scenes inside the counting hall after votes were cast had been 'absolutely astonishing', Mr Erlam told Mr Mawrey. There were close to 1,000 people in the hall, the vast majority of whom wore the rosettes of Mr Rahman's Tower Hamlets First party, Mr Erlam said. He said he did not know Mr Rahman and his decision to launch legal action was not personal. He also said there were witnesses with 'important evidence' who were frightened of coming forward. 'It’s not a personal vendetta against Lutfur Rahman,' Mr Erlam told the judge. 'It’s about democracy. It is to be defended and fought for and it should not be taken for granted.' Challenge: Mr Erlam's group wants election commissioner Richard Mawrey - who is sitting as a judge at an Election Court trial in London - to declare the result of the May 2014 election void and order a re-run . The group of four voters have mounted a challenge under the provisions the Representation Of The People Act. Lawyers for the group have made a series of allegations, including 'personation' in postal voting and at polling stations, and ballot paper tampering. Mr Rahman says there is 'little if any' evidence of wrongdoing against him. His lawyers have described the group of four’s claims as invention, exaggeration and 'in some cases downright deliberately false allegations'. The hearing continues.","Local activist Andy Erlam claims police stood by as voters were bullied .

"Secret Service Deputy Director Alvin 'A.T.' Smith resigned Monday but has landed an equally cushy job that the Homeland Security Department won't name or explain . What new job in the Homeland Security Department is the ousted No. 2 official at the Secret Service doing? Nobody's saying. Alvin 'A.T.' Smith, who ran day-to-day operations at the Secret Service during its most embarrassing scandals, resigned under pressure as deputy director earlier this week. In what appears to be a highly unorthodox employment shuffle, Smith – who earned as much as $183,000 a year – was permitted to take an unspecified job inside the highly regarded Homeland Security Investigations unit in U.S. Immigrations and Customs Enforcement. Both agencies are part of the Homeland Security Department. But no one will disclose Smith's new job title, his responsibilities or how much public salary he's earning. It's a mystery whether Smith is investigating cases, shuffling paperwork behind a desk or supervising agents. Smith was among the last senior Secret Service official left unscathed after a shakeup that started with the forced resignation of then-Director Julia Pierson. Four other senior leaders, including the man in charge of protection operations, were ousted last month. Amid the upheaval, the chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, Utah Republican Rep. Jason Chaffetz, and others have criticized Smith, saying he was at the center of bad decisions made in a sequence of Secret Service scandals. But until Monday, when the Secret Service announced his departure in a three-paragraph statement, Smith's job seemed safe. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEOS . EMBARRASSING: The Secret Service has weathered a series of security lapses in the past year, including a crazed fence jumper who entered the White House with a knife and a gunman who struck the White House with a rifle; in that case the agency didn't know his shot had hit its mark for four days . OPEN-DOOR POLICY: Omar Gonzalez, 42, scaled the White House's 7-foot fence in September 2014, ran across the White House lawn and entered the building through an open door . The Homeland Security Department won't provide details about his new job. Smith spent 29 years with the Secret Service, including a stint as the head of the agency's investigations division and is nearing retirement. Federal law enforcement officers are forced off the job at 57. Smith did not respond to messages from The Associated Press emailed to him and left with the public affairs office of his new agency. A senior executive with the government, Smith could have been fired for misconduct or poor performance. Unlike lower level government employees, very few rules protect a high-level job, said Carol Bonosaro of the nonprofit Senior Executives Association, a professional group that advocates for top-level government workers. Secret Service Acting Director Joseph Clancy could have transferred Smith within the agency or fired him outright, but Clancy wouldn't have authority to transfer him to another agency within the Homeland Security Department, Bonosaro said. The transfer would have involved approval from top officials within the department, run by Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson. Johnson last year pledged that 'ethics in government, setting the example and remaining above reproach are essential elements of good leadership.' Johnson has not commented on Smith's departure. LAST LINE OF DEFENSE: The Secret Service is a living, breathing cordon of security around the President of the United States, the Vice President, and other constitutional officers of government . The timing of Smith's departure was curious. He was expected to testify Thursday, alongside Clancy, during a congressional hearing of the House Oversight Committee. Smith and Clancy now aren't testifying, although Clancy is expected to appear at a hearing later. Chaffetz and the committee's top Democrat, Elijah Cummings of Maryland, said Monday they commended the Secret Service for its recent job changes, including transferring Smith. The committee is expected to hear from four former officials who concluded that poor training and management contributed to last year's security missteps, including an incident in which a Texas man armed with a knife scaled a White House fence and ran deep into the executive mansion before being caught. Smith was in charge of day-to-day operations at the time, and during an earlier instance when President Barack Obama was allowed to ride in an elevator with an armed security contractor who had not been properly vetted by the agency. He was new to the job as deputy director when a group of agents were caught up in a prostitution scandal in advance of Obama's arrival at a South American summit in April 2012. Smith isn't the first embattled Homeland Security Department official to quietly transfer amid concerns about his performance. In December 2013, then-acting Inspector General Charles Edwards took another job in the department days before he was scheduled to testify before a Senate subcommittee investigating allegations of wrongdoing within his office. About five months later, Johnson suspended Edwards within hours of the publication of that subcommittee's report that concluded that Edwards was too cozy with senior department officials. Edwards, who was also a senior executive in the department, remains on paid leave.","Alvin 'A.T.' Smith ran day-to-day operations at the Secret Service while it was dragged through scandal after scandal .
He resigned this week but landed a job at DHS with an investigative unit inside Immigration and Customs Enforcement .
The Obama administration won't say what Smith's new title is or what his duties will be, but his transfer instead of dismissal would have been approved at the highest levels .

"A former bank worker is facing jail for helping steal £123,000 from a customer - despite her claims she was forced into the plot by conmen who threatened to publish naked pictures of her online. Anisyah Ali, who worked at Halifax's North Finchley branch, passed confidential details to her then-fiance Salim Hussain and others, who looted customer Julian Masters' bank account. She claimed she only agreed to aid with the scam after fraudsters threatened to publish compromising photos of her on the internet. Both Ali, 25,  and Salim, 29,  are tonight facing prison sentences after they were convicted of fraud. Former bank adviser Anisyah Ali was found guilty of fraud for aiding a plot to spirit £123,000 out of a customer's account. She insisted she was forced to help fraudsters, who threatened to publish photos of her . The Old Bailey heard Ali abused her position as a personal banker to order a new debit card and PIN number for an account, which was then used by criminals. The new card was used to buy  cars and gold jewellery and withdraw cash, the court was told. The card was blocked in 2012 because of the unusual spending pattern on the account. But information gleaned from the account allowed the fraudsters to phone the bank to remove a block, prosecutors said. By the time the customer spotted the fraud, purchases totaling £123,000 had already been approved. The bank declined another £114,000. Receipts for cash payments totalling more than £1,500 were later found in Ali's bag while receipts for gold jewellery were found in her Southall home, which she then shared with Hussain. Ali's now ex-husband, Salim Hussain, was also found guilty of fraud by false representation for his role in the scam . Other successful transactions included the purchase of two cars, for £7,950 and £6,900. Prosecutor, David Hughes said: '[Ali] was a pivotal figure. The fraud could not have been carried out without the involvement of Ms Ali. 'She used and abused her position to access the account, obtain the necessary information to change the account owner's address to another one connected to the fraudsters and enabled the obtaining of the debit card used to carry out fraudulent transactions in a variety of locations on many occasions.' Ali said she was forced to take part in the fraud by conmen who threatened to publish photos of her online. She wept as she told how her friends and family had deserted her after the naked 'sexts', which she had sent to a previous lover and had already ended up on a Danish porn website and fake Facebook profile. She said: 'It is a very, very difficult subject. When he told me it was going to happen for a second time it made me even more scared because it would have involved Salim’s family and we would not be able to get married. 'They would have thought very bad of me. For me to know he could have been taken away from me at any point because of that, it frightened me, it scared me, and to know that he could have been hurt at the same time.' Salim claimed he and his now ex-wife Ali were subjected to a campaign of harassment by Alexander Saeed, who earlier admitted fraud. He said he did not benefit from the scam and only did as he was told because he was scared of Saeed. 'I was never, ever in possession of the card. I didn't have any of the card details,' he told the jury; 'I didn't know what transactions were taking place at any time.' Ali, of Norwood, south London, was convicted of one count of fraud by false representation and one count of fraud by abuse of position. Salim, of Southall, west London, was found guilty of a single count of fraud by false representation. The Old Bailey heard the couple could now face jail when they are sentenced later this year . Judge Michael Shorrock QC warned both they face immediate jail terms when they are sentenced alongside Alexander Saeed in April. Detective Constable Aine Matthews, the officer leading the investigation, said after the convictions: 'Rather than safeguarding the interests of her customers, Ali did the exact opposite and betrayed the position of trust she held within the bank. 'Today's convictions send out a clear message to those facing the same temptation – commit these crimes and you will be brought to justice.' Another man, Zain Hussain, of Hounslow, west London, was found not guilty of fraud.","Worker helped change account details so fraudsters could plunder cash .

"The grandmother who helped organize a staged kidnapping of her 6-year-old grandson to teach him a lesson about stranger danger appeared in court on Tuesday as she was charged for the traumatic four-hour experience. Rose Brewer is sharing the same lawyer as the man who lured her unnamed grandson after school one day, 23-year-old Nathan Firoved, and both entered not guilty pleas. The boy's mother, 25-year-old Elizabeth Hupp, and aunt, 38-year-old Denise Kroutil, will enter their pleas at their next February 26 court date, according to St Louis Today. Rose Brewer (left) pleaded not guilty on Tuesday to charges she kidnapped her 6-year-old grandson to toughen him up. She shares a lawyer with family friend Nathan Firoved (right) who also entered a not guilty plea . The boy's mother, grandmother, aunt and her co-worker Firoved are accused of terrorizing a 6-year-old boy in an attempt to toughen him up because he was too nice to strangers. The incident took place last week in Troy, Missouri, where Lincoln County sheriff’s deputies say the child was lured into a pickup truck by Firoved while he was walking home from school. Once inside the truck, Firoved told him he would never ‘see his mommy again’, and he would be ‘nailed to the wall of a shed’ Fox 2 reported. The crying child was then shown a gun and threats were made to hurt him if he did not stop crying. The boy’s hands and feet were then bound with plastic bags and he was blindfolded with a jacket. The boy's mother Elizabeth Hupp (left) and aunt Denise Kroutil (right) are also facing charges but have not yet entered pleas . Firoved drove the boy around for a while to disorient him and then took the terrified child unknowingly to his home. The ordeal did not end there. His aunt then removed the boy’s pants, told him he could be sold into sex slavery and shouted at him for not resisting either her or Firoved. He was then left in the basement for some time before being untied. Family members then lectured him about stranger danger. The whole ordeal went on for four hours. The boy told school officials about the incident soon afterwards, and they called the local division of Family Services. Firoved works with Kroutil and told deputies that he was asked to kidnap the boy to ‘scare’ him because he was ‘too nice’ to people. The suspects have told investigators that they were trying to teach the boy a lesson. They were reportedly unrepentant and felt they did nothing wrong. All four suspects are being held at Lincoln County Jail on $250,000 cash only bonds and are facing charges including felony kidnapping and abuse and neglect of a child. The boy has been placed into protective custody.","The six-year-old was lured into a pickup truck by family friend Nathan Firoved as he walked home from school .

"John McAfee has settled down in Lexington, Tennessee with his wife and plans to stay there, confessing: 'I'm tired of running.' The millionaire software tycoon, who made his fortune in cyber security, fled his home in Belize in 2012 after he was named as a 'person of interest' in the murder of his neighbor. He moved to Portland, Oregon and then to Montreal after he was evicted. Now he and his wife Janice are living in plain sight in Lexington - even though he believes he's still a wanted man. 'I've been on the move for two years because the government of Belize is trying to silence me,' he told USA Today. 'I speak out against the government. I have a great deal of information that implicates the government in very heinous crimes and gross corruption.' Staying put: John McAfee, pictured before leaving Belize, is now living in Lexington, Tennessee after two years of being on the run from assassins from Belize, he said. He is now prepared to stand up for himself, he said . New life: He is living in Tennessee with his wife Janice (pictured together), whom he married in 2013 . He would not provide any further details. McAfee, 69, explained that he spent most of last year running from assassins sent from Belize, where he was named in the shooting death of Gregory Faull, 52, in November 2012. McAfee fled the country, saying he feared the crime would give Belize authorities an excuse to finally hold him because he had repeatedly accused them of corruption. Since then, he has moved 'from town to town, from hotel to hotel', he told USA Today. 'I'm finally tired of it, I'm settling down and I'm defending my home,' he said.' I'm tired of running. I've gone from being frightened to mostly angry.' Still - he's prepared for if authorities turn up at his door. He says it's just a matter of time. 'I'm fully prepared for the eventuality that there will be an attempted raid on my residence or my car or my person at some place or at some time,' he said. 'At some point you have to stand up and defend your position, your home, your family - and that's what I'm doing.' He claimed that his car had recently been shot at, but that the vehicle has been fitted with a heavy-duty crash guard in case he is ever cornered and needs to force his way through vehicles. He added, 'I am constantly armed, I am an excellent shot' - explaining that he has won numerous shooting contests. Mystery: He was named as a person of interest in the murder of his neighbor, Greg Faull (pictured), in 2012. McAfee claims authorities  wanted to hold him because he had accused them of corruption . Authorities in Lexington and the mayor have welcomed him and his tech acumen with open arms, he said. He now lives there with his wife Janice, whom he married in 2013. He works as a security expert for Fox News via Skype and occasionally appears at hacker conferences, where his security is tight. He also oversees and mentors around 10 start-ups, while also developing his own security products, USA Today reported. According to reports, his fortune, which was totaled more than $100million, has dwindled down to a few million dollars - possibly less - but he would not comment on this. Faull, who lived next to McAfee, was found dead in his home in November 2012. He had previously filed a complaint against McAfee's 'dangerous' dogs and in the days before his death, McAfee had found a couple of his dogs poisoned. After his death, McAfee said they had only ever exchanged a handful of words and that he had never thought Faull was behind the dog poisonings. He also offered a $25,000 reward for information leading to the arrest of Faull's killer - but this didn't convince Faull's family, who have sued McAfee, claiming he killed the man or ordered his death.","The software tycoon, 69, has now settled in plain sight in Lexington with his wife Janice - even though he believes he's still a wanted man .

"Record numbers of illegal migrants are being stopped at UK borders, it was revealed last night. Senior officials said 36,000 unlawful stowaways had been discovered since last April. Sir Charles Montgomery, the director general of the Border Force, said 30,000 were found by British officers at Calais, while 6,000 were detained on UK soil. In 2013-14, the number caught was half that, at 18,000, he said. Scroll down for video . Illegal migrants chase a truck to try to board it in Calais: Senior officials said 36,000 unlawful stowaways had been discovered since last April, double the number detected the previous year . Campaigners said the number who actually reached Britain was likely to be far higher, possibly in the hundreds of thousands. Sir Charles told the Home Affairs Select Committee it was not possible to stop all illegal migration. He said: ‘I cannot look this committee in the eye and say I can operate 100 per cent control so 100 per cent of clandestines will not get across the border.’ He confirmed that not a single person arriving by train or coach – some ten million – is so far counted in and out, or checked against criminal watchlists. MPs on the committee warned holidaymakers could face huge queues at Eurotunnel and ferry ports when checks on passengers leaving Britain start on April 8. Border chiefs have already pushed back the start date for the checks by one week to avoid introducing the new system over the busy Easter weekend. Checks will involve operators recording passport information on all travellers and passing the details on to the Home Office, which will use the details to identify immigration offenders. However, Sir Charles told MPs coach parties of children under 16 would be excluded to reduce delays. He added: ‘The coach sector is the most difficult of all logistically and that has been the focus of trials and testing. We still have to refine the process to ensure it works as smoothly as possible. I’m confident we will have a solution come the live date.’ Calais is under pressure from more than 2,500 immigrants, many fleeing disasters in Africa and the Middle East. Often they are determined to reach the UK, attracted by work, free health care and generous benefits. Many are ‘prepared to die’ to reach Britain, believing it to be like the mythical lost city of gold, El Dorado, according to Calais mayor Natacha Bouchart. On October, a 16-year-old Ethiopian girl was killed when she was knocked down as she crossed the Channel Tunnel approach road. Humanitarian assistance: Migrants receive hot food from the association 'La Vie Active' in Calais, at the site where a new day center was opened able to accommodate more then 1,500 migrants a day . Sniffer dogs, carbon dioxide detectors, heartbeat monitors and scanners are all used to find stowaways. Britain has also given £12million to the French to improve security measures, including a 9ft-high fence – dubbed the ‘ring of steel – which was used to protect world leaders attending the Nato summit in Wales in September. But transport firms said that rather than deporting any captured stowaways back to their home countries, France is simply releasing them to have another go at breaching Britain’s borders. Meanwhile, the Home Office announced a new independent immigration inspector to replace John Vine, who stepped down in December in ‘frustration’ at ministers’ attempts to ‘manipulate’ his reports about border chaos. His successor is David Bolt, a former MI5 officer who also worked for the defunct Serious Organised Crime Agency. Mr Bolt has been appointed to the £130,000-a-year job on a fixed term two-year contract, one year shorter than his predecessor. He is currently chief executive of the International Federation of Spirits Producers, which combats international trade in counterfeit spirits. Britain has also signed up to a new European database designed to stop foreign killers, terrorists and paedophiles entering the UK. In a bid to tighten up Britain’s borders, the Government has finally negotiated access to the Second Generation Schengen Information System, known as ‘SIS II’, which has details of 250,000 wanted or missing people. The system, used by 28 countries, will issue alerts about the most dangerous on-the-run criminals as well as suspected jihadists returning from Syria and Iraq, missing people and stolen goods.","Numbers of migrants detected at the border has doubled in a year .

"Despite the push for magazines to drop photoshop and stop airbrushing the photographs of women that fill their pages, more than half of women are editing their own images before putting them online. According to new research by beautyheaven.com.au , over two thirds of Australian women believe it's wrong for magazines to edit photos before they go to print.However 57 per cent of these ladies also admitted to altering their own pictures before posting them on various social media sites. Scroll down for video . New research from beautyheaven.com.au has revealed more than half of women edit their social media photos before posting them online. Pictured is Carli from beautyheaven before (left) and after (right) using photo-editing app ModiFace Photo Editor . Australian TV presenter Laura Csortan has previously been accused of altering her Instagram photos . Further to this almost two thirds of women surveyed force friends to show them photos for approval before they're posted online, and 60 per cent untag themselves from images they aren't happy with. Editing images before posting them on social media has become somewhat of a trend with celebrities, with everyone from Beyonce and Kim Kardashian to Aussie TV presenter Laura Csortan accused of altering their pictures. Most Australian women are taking three or more selfies to make sure they've got the perfect angle before sharing it with others, while just over ten per cent snap more than ten pictures to ensure they've got the best shot. 'It seems there are double standards when it comes to photo editing,' Carli Alman, Editor of beautyheaven said of the research. 'Aussie women want it to stop in magazines but many are editing their own pics. Despite editing their own images, over two thirds of Australian women say they are against magazines photoshopping pictures . Editing images before posting them on social media has become somewhat of a trend with celebrities . 'They've seen celebs like Beyoncé and Miranda Kerr looking perfect in their social media snaps, knowing many of these images have been edited and now there is a copycat effect.' Carli added. With the rise of apps such as the ModiFace Photo Editor, Photowonder and Perfect365, photo editing is becoming more and more common, as these are all accessible on a smart phone. In line with Beyonce apparently editing her thighs in a number of her Instagram pictures, thighs are one of the body parts Australian women want to change most. Stomachs and skin are also among the most commonly edited features, while one in five women just want to look slimmer all over. Meantime 18 per cent of the ladies surveyed admitted that the profile picture on their social media page is so heavily edited it's a not a realistic representation of them. Kris Jenner has also been accused of editing images: on the left is a photo posted by Gordon Ramsay, while the right image was later posted by Kris . Clinical Physcologist Dr Vivienne Lewis said body image dissatisfaction is 'becoming more and more of a problem for women' Dr Vivienne Lewis, a Clinical Pyshcologist at University of Canberra, who specialises in body image issues, said body image dissatisfaction is 'becoming more and more of a problem for women'. 'The thing is they're constantly having to meet unrealistic standers of beauty,' Dr Lewis told Daily Mail Australia. She said there is pressure to be slim, with clear skin, have a perfect facial structure, and just be traditionally beautiful, and social media can exacerbate this pressure. 'Women in particular who are very concerned about their bodies can spend hours editing photos,' Dr Lewis revealed. 'Social media is certainly putting us under more and more pressure to look our very best, and that often falls in line with the sort of ideals we see elsewhere.' Dr Lewis said social media can exacerbate the desire to be traditionally beautiful . 'It's all about celebrating body diversity and embracing your own uniqueness' Dr Lewis said . The body image expert added that because there is access to photo editing apps, there is an expectation to use them. But she said women need to embrace the way they - and those around them - look. 'It's the judgement of others that women get concerned about and comparisons to other women. 'It's all about celebrating body diversity and embracing your own uniqueness. The more and more people who are able to accept others for what they look like.. the more likely we are to do it to ourselves', Dr Lewis said. Carli from beautyheaven echoed these sentiments, saying: 'It’s normal to want to look good in pictures but it’s important we are having fun with our social media images and not taking it too far.' 'Look to beauty products to enhance things like your skin and fun poses to make you look slimmer before you turn to major editing tools. 'And remember it’s you who your social media friends want to see!' she added.","66 per cent of Australian women disagree with magazines editing photos .

"Mother-of-three Milli Hill, 40, has shared her views on paternity leave in an online column . A mother-of-three has claimed that fathers are as 'useful as t*ts on a bull' following the arrival of a baby because newborns 'don't want dad'. Milli Hill, 40, from Somerset, has stirred up controversy with her comments - written in a column for Best Daily - in response to the news Labour plan to extend paternity leave to four weeks. She writes: 'This time of nurturing a tiny life is mainly (not 'just', but 'mainly'), for mums, and dads who have visions of bonding in this time are likely to end up feeling disappointed, left out and about as useful as t*ts on a bull.' She added: 'Whilst a woman can perform brain surgery or lead a multi-national, I'm afraid to break it to you that there is something a man can't do – and that's be a mother. 'As I discovered when I realised that my breast-pump was the worst twenty quid I ever spent: no matter what technology you employ or how good your intent, to a baby this is meaningless. 'A small breastfed baby doesn't want a plastic teat and quite often, they don't want dad either. They just want you. 'More time for dads in the early weeks will be largely wasted, because, no matter what breast-pump manufacturers or Westminster policy makers might try to tell you, the so-called ""Paternity Month"" is actually a ""Babymoon"", an epic and life-changing love-in, and it belongs uniquely to mother and child.' Milli's comments sparked a furious reaction on Twitter as parents responded to her views. BeautifulBairns tweeted that Milli was 'utterly wrong' and Phyllida Warmington pointed out: 'I do think a dads presence in the early days in invaluable for practical/emotional support for the mother.' Parenting blogger Tom Briggs, pictured, thinks fathers can play an important role in their child's first days . Katherine Woodbury tweeted: 'My husband and I would have done ANYTHING for more time together. Not all births/PN are straightforward.' Jonathan, 39, a father-of-two, from Hertfordshire, said he was outraged by Milli's comments. He told MailOnline: 'She's made me angry as she generalises and assumes the early days of having a baby are the same for all parents. In fact, childbirth and the days that follow are a unique experience and different for everyone.' Jonathan said that Milli fails to consider how mothers may need the support of their partner if they are recovering from a caesarean section, have other children to attend to, or are simply overwhelmed by becoming a new mother. His own wife had C-sections to deliver both their children and he said she needed him more than ever afterwards. He said she would have struggled if he had not been able to take an extra week holiday following his two-week paternity leave. Fathers argued that they can still bond with their babies with skin-on-skin contact (photo posed by models) Milli's article prompted reaction on social media including this tweet from Katherine Woodbury, left, who said mothers need their partner if a birth was not straightforward, and 'King Of Dads said they were irked, right . He said: 'Particularly after our second child was born, I was needed at home to help look after our two-year-old. 'I wanted to be there to get to know my children and to support my wife, even if that just meant making her a cup of tea.' He added he could bond with his newborns by skin-on-skin contact even if he couldn't feed them. Parenting blogger Tom Briggs, who runs the website diaryofthedad.co.uk, agrees. He said: 'I'd say that it's essential that dads are around from birth - although there are things that we obviously can't do, such as breastfeeding, there's lots that we can do to support our partners and, just as importantly, bond with our children. 'If you take into consideration the fact that we're already at a disadvantage due to biological reasons, it's even more important that we're about in the first few weeks to bond with them and I don't think she has considered dads' feelings. 'The first few weeks of being a parent is certainly not something that's exclusive to mother and child. Parenting is a shared privilege and responsibility from the word go.' Speaking to MailOnline today, Milli said she was sorry if her article had offended parents. She said: 'I'm aware that the article has sparked controversy and I am extremely sorry if I have offended fathers - this was not my intention. 'I do wish I had written more about the importance of fathers but the focus of my article was motherhood and the point I wished to make was that, in particular in the early weeks, there is a mother-baby relationship underway which is very intense and special. Milli believes the most important person to a newborn is their mother and the 'babymoon' belongs uniquely to them, meaning fathers can feel left out (file photo) 'Fathers can of course - and do - support mums by taking care of the house, shopping etc and this is fantastic. But the fundamental bonding time that is taking place is largely between mum and baby and I don't think we should be afraid of saying this. 'I think that it would be great if dads could have more flexible time off after birth - I understand in Australia for example they can take the paternity leave at any time in the first year which makes a lot more sense. 'I'm just not convinced that, if we are saying that dads can only have four weeks off, that weeks two to four are the best time for them to take this leave.' Acknowledging Jonathan's point that mothers may need extra support after a caesarean birth or if they are struggling with post natal depression, or feeling overwhelmed, she said: 'Mothers are still going to struggle if dad has four weeks off and then returns to work. 'What is needed for these women - and ALL women - is better support: better preparation for motherhood, better birth experiences, better follow-up from midwives (and this means more midwives) and better support networks around them.' Fathers are especially needed when a couple has more than one child following a new arrival (file photo) Milli wrote her thought-provoking piece in response to Labour leader Ed Miliband's announcement that his party would increase paternity pay to £260-a-week, the equivalent of the minimum wage, so more working fathers can afford to take time off. The father-of-two believes more dads want to play a hands-on role in childcare but are 'frustrated by out-dated laws and entitlements'. Jonathan admits he would have been unlikely to take four weeks paternity leave had it been available when his children were born because it would have meant they had less money coming in. But he thinks it's important fathers have the option. 'The choice should be there. Fathers spending more time with their children can only be a good thing,' he said. 'Many fathers won't take a month off because of finances and the pressure from colleagues to return to work. We need a cultural change so a father taking a month off after his child is born isn't unusual.'","Milli Hill, 40, sparked controversy with her comments in Best magazine .

"A Boston woman has launched a new healthy chocolate company which specializes in healthy, vegan treats, which are targeted at women suffering from pre-menstrual sugar cravings. Tania Green, the creator of the gluten-free, all-natural, vegan PMS Bites, has turned to crowdsourcing website Kickstarter in order to fund her new food-focused venture - and has already managed to raise more than $5,000 in just ten hours. 'We have all been there: boobs swell, stomach bloats, feelings hurt, friends and significant others become annoying, work becomes overwhelming, and the only relief seems to be a pound of chocolate and a good cry,' she said on the site. Scroll down for video . Entrepreneurial talent: Tania Green, from Boston, came up with the idea for PMS Bites after struggling with her own PMS-related sugar cravings . Healthy treats: The chocolate bites contain only all-natural ingredients and are gluten-free . 'Pre-menstrual Syndrome (PMS) is a real problem—and it bites. Eighty to ninety percent of women suffer from PMS, and thirty to forty percent find symptoms debilitating enough to interfere with their everyday lives.' After struggling through years of unwanted PMS-related symptoms herself, including violent mood swings, fatigue, bloating and persistent food cravings, Tania decided to take matters into her own hands and implement a number of lifestyle changes which she hoped would help her to conquer the impact of her monthly cycle. 'I asked myself how I could fix this huge problem in my life,' she explained in her PMS Bites video ad. 'I exercised more, even when I didn't feel like it, I would eat healthier, drink way less caffeine and get a ton of sleep. 'All of those things worked, but cravings sucked the most. I would reach for cookies, brownies, and, while it satisfied me in the moment, later on I would feel guilty and my energy would drop.' Combat your cravings: Each of the chocolate-based bites has its own clever name, including Plain Crazy (pictured) which is Tania's original creation . Something exotic: Coco-Nutty is a chocolate bite which has been dusted with 'fluffy coconut' That's nutty! All Kinds of Nuts features chocolate, oats and pecans . With a lack of readily available healthy treats in her cupboards, the entrepreneur decided to concoct the ideal antidote to her seemingly endless food cravings herself, focusing on healthy, natural ingredients which would create a delicious delicacy - without the added sugar and calories. 'I went into my kitchen one day and threw a bunch of stuff into a bowl,' she added. 'Dates, cocoa powder, oats; I wanted it to be as healthy as possible. 'I started to experiment, and after a lot of trial and error - I mean a lot of hours in the kitchen - I bit into this thing and thought, ""my god, finally, a treat that I can crave, enjoy, and feel no regrets"".' And in addition to the more basic ingredients, which also include pecans and coconut, Tania also created her own special blend of herbs, which she believes will help women to combat any other unwelcome symptoms of PMS. Bad times: Tania explained that, in the lead up to her monthly cycle, she often found herself lusting after fatty foods, such as pizza and ice cream . Dr Jekyll? During the rest of the month, Tania is focused and together (L), however while she is on her period (R), things are very different . All-natural: Tania's PMS Bites use completely natural ingredients, providing a healthy option for anyone who suffers from sugar cravings . 'The bites also contain dandelion root, Siberian ginseng, and chamomile,' the product description explains. 'Studies have shown these ingredients may be good for bloating, every day stress, and irritability.' Tania's PMS Bites are currently available in three flavors, all of which have been given a suitably hormonal moniker. Plain Crazy is the original Bite and is described as being 'crafted with premium fair-trade cocoa powder and hearty oats', while Coco-Nutty comes complete with a 'generous sprinkling on fluffy coconut' and All Kinds of Nuts - unsurprisingly - have been rolled in pecans. Thus far, Tania's Kickstarter campaign has raised just under $5,400 in less than 12 hours - nearly $400 above her initial fundraising target. Her aim is to have an official PMS Bites kitchen up and running by March, with the first batch of orders - which can be made as monthly subscriptions timed to arrive at the perfect moment - due to be shipped in April.","Tania Green, from Boston, started a Kickstarter campaign on Wednesday morning to help her fund the launch of her PMS Bites .

"David Cameron complained that Ed Miliband was 'personally horrid' to him when they clashed during Prime Minister's Questions, MailOnline has learned. The Labour leader tore into the PM at lunchtime, accusing him of being 'dodgy' and 'rotten' in one of the most aggressive clashes for months. As Mr Cameron left the Chamber he complained to Tory ministers about the onslaught, claiming Mr Miliband had hit out 'because he was losing'. Scroll down for video . Labour leader Ed Miliband tore into David Cameron in the Commons over tax avoidance, accusing him being 'rotten' in one of the most aggressive clashes for months . Prime Minister's Questions was dominated by angry exchanges over party donors and allegations of the wealthy using Swiss bank accounts with HSBC. Former Conservative Party Treasurer Stanley Fink and German-born car manufacturing heir Georg von Opel, who has donated six-figure sums to the Tories, are among a host of individuals who legally held accounts in Switzerland with HSBC's private bank, according to a leaked tax disc. However, there is no suggestion of any wrongdoing. Labour have also raised questions about why Mr Cameron hired former HSBC boss Stephen Green as a trade minister and Tory peer. Mr Miliband turned his fire on the PM, claiming Tory donors hoarded money in Switzerland. The Labour leader said his rival was 'bang to rights', adding: 'He can't get away from it – he's a dodgy Prime Minister, surrounded by dodgy donors.' He later blasted:  'There is something rotten at the heart of the Tory Party and it's you.' Mr Cameron claimed that Labour had taken donations from people involved in the HSBC scandal. But Mr Miliband responded: 'None of these people had given a penny on my watch and you are up to your neck in this.' Leaving the Commons chamber after PMQs, Mr Cameron was overheard claiming Mr Miliband lashed out because he was losing . The session continued for around 15 minutes, with backbench MPs putting questions to the PM, before the two men went their separate ways. However, Mr Cameron remained furious and was heard claiming the Labour leader has lashed out with increasingly aggressive attacks because he was not winning the battle. It is understood Mr Cameron was overheard telling Conservative ministers as he left the Chamber: 'Ed was personally horrid to me because he was losing.' Downing Street declined to comment on the remarks but senior Tories questioned what had happened to Labour promises to end so-called Punch and Judy politics. A Conservative source said: 'We have heard all the stuff from Labour about how they want to change the tone and nature of PMQs but it does't seem to translate into the actual Wednesday lunchtime exchanges.' But the complaints attracted little sympathy. Labour MP Diane Abbott tweeted: 'So David Cameron complains Ed Mili was 'horrid' to him. Prime Minister, the last 5 years have been SO HORRID for so many across this country.' Mr Cameron's unhappiness at the abuse from Mr Miliband comes after he branded the Labour leader a 'complete waste of space' in December and a 'complete shambles' last month. Labour MP Diane Abbott mocked Mr Cameron for complaining about having a tough time in the Commons . Commons Speaker John Bercow had to intervene several times to call for calm as the exchanges became more fractious. In one exchange Mr Miliband said: 'You took the money, you gave a job to the head of HSBC and you let the tax avoiders get away with it. 'There's something rotten at the heart of the Conservative Party and it's you.' But Mr Cameron insisted 'no-one had done more' than the current government to crack down on tax avoidance. He told the Labour leader: 'I will tell you about the difference between you and me. When people donate to the Conservative Party they don't pick the candidates, they don't choose the policies, they don't elect the leader. 'When the trade unions fund the Labour Party they pay for the candidates, they pay for the policies, and the only reason you are sitting there is because a bunch of trade union leaders decided you were more left wing than your brother.' Furious MPs have accused Britain’s tax authorities of 'failing' the public by letting thousands of people stash their cash in Swiss bank accounts. The Chair of the House of Commons Public Accounts Committee Margaret Hodge said she was furious at the 'pathetic' response to leaked HSBC files which showed thousands of British-linked individuals held bank accounts in Switzerland. It came after revelations HM Revenue and Customs received a list of 6,800 HSBC customers with Swiss bank accounts five years ago – but had only managed to prosecute one person, despite £135million in owed tax being recovered. Margaret Hodge said she was furious at the 'pathetic' response to leaked HSBC files showing thousands of British-linked individuals held bank accounts in Switzerland . Mrs Hodge said HMRC had failed to serve British taxpayers' interests in their response to the leak in 2010. She laid the blame at the door of the tax authorities for failing to act on the leaked list of Swiss bank account owners. She said the activities related to the Geneva branch of HSBC's Swiss subsidiary were 'pretty outrageous'. She told HMRC chief Lin Homer that taxmen should have spoken to whistleblower Herve Falciani, who initially obtained the list while employed as an IT worker in 2007. HMRC chief Lin Homer defended her record prosecuting tax dodgers . Ms Homer insisted that HMRC staff had been 'diligent' in their approach to the files, and said their record of securing one conviction and £135 million in unpaid tax, fines and interest compared well with other countries. But Ms Hodge told her that the French tax authorities had recouped £200 million from 3,000 names and the Spanish £180 million from 2,900. And she told the HMRC chief: 'It's pretty outrageous what was going on. 'It's the first time in many of these leaks that there are really strong allegations not of egregious tax avoidance, but of tax evasion, and that is incredibly serious. 'For you to sit there and say, as you are doing, that ‘We couldn't get the money in in the same way as the French and Spanish did’ and ‘We didn't litigate because we wanted to get the money in’ and yet you did worse on the money - it leaves me believing that you are not serving the British taxpayer.' Responding to Ms Hodge's comments, Ms Homer insisted: ‘That is absolutely not the case.’ Some 300 staff, led by three directors, had been sifting through the data supplied by French authorities in 2010 and had traced 3,200 individuals, including 150 ‘most serious’ cases which could be considered for criminal prosecution, 500 which were ‘more serious’ but not likely to meet the criminal threshold and 400-500 which could be pursued for disclosure and settlement. Ms Homer, who was appointed to lead HMRC in 2012, said she believed the authority would have told Government ministers about the data within months of receiving it. ‘We are confident we will have told ministers that we were about to receive a big tranche of operational information,’ she said. ‘We will have told people, including ministers, I suspect some time in the next few months.’ HMRC had previously told the committee that it hoped to bring about 15 cases to prosecution, but in the event three were passed on to the Crown Prosecution Service, which decided to take just one to court.","EXCLUSIVE: Cameron overheard complaining as he left the Commons .

"A proud grandfather has shared his granddaughter's incredible progress after undergoing surgery for her cleft palate. Eighteen-month-old Lexi Grace was born in June 2013 with a severe cleft palate and lip. Her grandfather wrote that, although she suffered from discomfort and struggled with feeding, Lexi Grace was still 'a happy baby'. A proud grandfather (pictured) has shared 18-month-old Lexi Grace's incredible progress after undergoing surgery for her severe cleft palate and lip . Cleft lip and palate are caused by abnormal facial development that occurs while the child is still a fetus. The upper lip and roof of the mouth are incompletely formed, causing the gap. It is one of the most common birth defects affecting children in North America, according to the American Society of Plastic Surgeons (ASPS). After reaching 10 pounds, Lexi Grace underwent a series of four surgeries to begin the process of having the cleft and lip repaired. Her grandfather wrote that, although she suffered from discomfort and struggled with feeding, Lexi Grace was still 'a happy baby' According to 'poppy', as his granddaughter now calls him, the baby had to have 'wires and gears' inserted into her mouth that would begin to mechanically pull the palate together. She would have to wear them for months at a time. Slowly Lexi Grace's appearance began to change, her grandfather wrote on online image community imgur. Then, finally, came time to suture the two sides of the gap together. Cleft lip and palate are caused by abnormal facial development that occurs when the child is still a fetus (pictured is Lexi Grace's ultrasound). The upper lip and roof of the mouth are incompletely formed . This would require surgery inside the baby's 'mouth, on the lip and in her nose'. According to ASPS, the cleft is closed by using tissues and muscles to rebuild the roof of the mouth. This is achieved by creating incisions that create flaps of tissue that are then stitched together and effectively close the cleft. Lexi Grace's surgery was done by Larry A. Sargent, a plastic surgeon in Chattanooga, Tennessee. The happy grandfather says that, six months after the surgery, Lexi Grace has healed tremendously. The baby then underwent surgery inside her 'mouth, on the lip and in her nose' to suture the two sides of the gap together. This is done by using tissues and muscles to rebuild the roof of the mouth . 'You can't even tell there was a problem to begin with,' he wrote. But the recovery is not over yet. After all of Lexi Grace's upper baby teeth will need to be pulled after they grow in so that her 'upper gum line can be put in place', her grandfather wrote. And she is currently having an especially hard time with teething. But the pictures don't lie. Lexi Grace is all smiles. Her grandfather thanked the imgur community, who he has shared Lexi Grace's story with since her birth. Lexi Grace's recovery is not over yet.

"Laid out in the hot sun after being killed and then dumped in a rubbish pile, these are the stray dogs of Karachi which have been rounded up and culled. The Pakistani city began a mass cull of the stray dogs after authorities became alarmed about their increasing numbers. Municipal workers were seen laying out out the bodies of the dead animals on the road after they were killed. Municipal workers in the Pakistani city of Karachi lay out the bodies of the stray dogs that have been culled as part of a new campaign . City officials became concerned about the number of stray dogs in Karachi and say they were prompted to take action . They were then thrown and dumped into a truck ready for them to be taken away and be disposed of. It comes after they were rounded up and exterminated after being classed as strays after being found wandering the streets. The increasing number of unwanted dogs in Karachi prompted the city officials to act and they decided to launch the culling campaign. The campaign follows a similar scheme in Lahore, where stray dogs are culled in order to keep citizens safe from dog biting incidents. Pakistan is one of several that is still to eliminate rabies, meaning a bite from an infected dog could be deadly . Pakistan is one of several countries that is still to eliminate rabies, meaning that receiving a bite from an infected dog could be deadly. The disease affects the central nervous system of most warm-blooded animals. According to the World Health Organisation few activities are underway to try to eliminate the infection in Pakistan, meaning people are at risk from rabid dogs. They add that culling alone will not eliminate the threat of rabies as there is no evidence to suggest it reduces the spread of the disease. Last year, officials in Russia came under fire after it was reported that the city of Sochi had hired a private company to kill as many stray dogs as possible before the Winter Olympics. After being killed, the dogs are then loaded and piled on the back of a truck ready for their bodies to be disposed of . The campaign follows a similar scheme in Lahore, where stray dogs are culled in order to keep citizens safe from dog biting incidents . A company was said to have been tasked with using poison and traps to cull the dogs before tourists and competitors descended for the Games' opening ceremony. Russia’s stray dog problem appears to stem from decades of animals being dumped on the streets when their owners realise they can no longer afford to keep them. These dogs then breed among themselves, giving rise to a population of animals that have never been properly domesticated.","Pakistani city of Karachi became alarmed by the number of stray dogs .

"Immigration Minister Peter Dutton has paid more than $2.3 million for a luxurious beach-front apartment on Queensland's so-called 'Millionaires Row'. The one-time Health Minister joins 11-time surfing legend Kelly Slater and five-time Moto GP world champion Mick Doohan as residents of the much-sought after address. According to OzPropertyData, the stamp duty alone on Mr Dutton's new digs on Jefferson Lane, is more than $120,000. The $2.3m Palm Beach property is a two-storey, four bedroom apartment with walk-on access to the beach . Happy days. Peter Dutton is congratulated by Governor-General Peter Cosgrove as he is sworn in as Immigration Minister. Mr Dutton is also celebrating the purchase of a $2.3m property on Queensland's 'Millionaires Row' A report in the Gold Coast Bulletin states the secret purchase was the third-highest on the strip in the past year. Mr Dutton snapped it up on December 15, just one week after Slater paid $2.15 million for his luxury apartment. 'We sold that property, we won't comment on buyers,' said McGrath Broadbeach's James Ledgerwood. 'Not only does it have ocean views but views all the way down the coastline,' said McGrath Broadbeach's James Ledgerwood . Peter Dutton (right) pictured on the front-bench with Prime Minister Tony Abbott and Treasurer Joe Hockey . Mr Dutton's new southern Queensland abode boasts two levels and four bedrooms plus four car spaces . 'What I can say is that's an exceptional property, a north facing corner position, not just does it have the views to the ocean, views also all the way up the coastline.' A nearby 5-bedroom Jefferson Lane property sold for $2.8 million just five months before their respective purchases. Peter Dutton, 44, was elected as Federal Member for Dickson in Queensland in November 2001. He held the Health and Sport portfolio for just over a year, overseeing the push for the $7 Medicare co-payment before the former police officer was made Immigration Minister in last December's Cabinet reshuffle by Prime Minister Tony Abbott. McGrath Broadbeach’s James Ledgerwood oversaw the sale of Mr Dutton’s new home. The Jefferson Lane property opens up onto a small backyard and then onto the golden sands of Palm Beach . Among his neighbours on 'Millionaires Row' will be Kelly Slater, 11-time world surfing champion, and Queensland's own superstar, 5-time MotoGP champion, Mick Doohan . The apartment has all the mod-cons and was the third highest price in the so-called 'Millionaires Row' in the past year . 'That area is very popular, it's a southern strip where some very wealthy owners are now based after deciding to call it home, it's very close to the lifestyle of Burleigh and Coolangatta,' Mr Ledgerwood said. 'The southern end of the coast has developed a great culture. 'Beach front sales are always a combination of those residing for the long term and others securing a holiday home. 'You know that the prices pre-GFC were actually higher than they are now, but at the same time we've past the bottom now and prices are again on the increase, they are purchasing them from a long-term investment view.'","New Immigration Minister Peter Dutton has paid $2.3 million for the Palm Beach property .

"A prominent US think tank has published a piece arguing that Tony Abbott is the most incompetent leader of an industrialised democracy and has 'proven so incapable' that he has to go.

It argues that in his two years as prime minister, Mr Abbott has proven 'shockingly incompetent', which explains why other Liberal party members may now scheme to unseat him. Scroll down for video . A leading United States think tank has published a piece arguing that Tony Abbott is the most incompetent leader of an industrialised democracy and has 'proven so incapable' that he has to go . 'Abbott has proven so incapable of clear policy thinking, so unwilling to consult with even his own ministers and advisers, and so poor at communicating that he has to go,' CFR senior fellow Joshua Kurlantzick wrote. 'Abbott's policies have been all over the map, and the lack of coherence has often made the prime minister seem ill-informed and incapable of understanding complex policy issues. 'In press conferences, Abbott has offered mixed public messages about some of the health care reforms that were at the center of his agenda, and sometimes has seemed unsure himself of what health legislation has actually been passed on his watch.' CFR is a respected Washington DC-based think-tank that is generally considered not to be aligned with either conservative or liberal politics. Mr Kurlantzick is listed as an expert on South East Asia, China, public diplomacy and democratisation in the developing world. He  also referenced recent government funding cuts to the ABC as a sign of Mr Abbott's 'incompetence'. The piece was published on the Council on Foreign Relations website and argues that Tony Abbott (pictured with wife Margie) has proven so 'shockingly incompetent' that he deserves to go . Author Joshua Kurlantzick, a US specialist in south-east Asian politics, argued Tony Abbott had poor policy thinking and a lack of communication . 'He also has seemed unsure of what he promised in the past regarding Australia's major public broadcaster – he promised not to touch it – before he went ahead and made cuts to it,' he wrote. The piece suggested Mr Abbott appeared to have one of the worst senses of public relations of any prime minister in recent Australian history. Mr Kurlantzick argued Mr Abbott's 'coarse rhetoric' had embarrassed Australia at major economic summits and he looked 'completely baffled' on climate changes issues at the G20 summit in Brisbane last year. The prime minister's recent decision to hand Prince Philip an Australian knighthood was described by Mr Kurlantzick as a 'bizarre choice'. 'I take no position on whether a left or right coalition can govern Australia better – whether Australia needs a revolt from within the ruling coalition or a national election victory by the left,' he wrote. 'But a country that for decades has punched above its weight on nearly every international issue surely can do much better for a Prime Minister than Tony Abbott.'

"The 13-year-old girl who took the Little League World Series by storm probably had what it takes to go all the way to the finals. The Chicago team that kicked Mo'ne Davis' Philadelphia crew out of the U.S. championship was stripped of their national title today after it was revealed they broke the rules and poached players from neighboring communities. The historic all-black Jackie Robinson West team beat Davis' Philadelphia team in the semi finals of the U.S. championship. If Davis' team won, they would have gone on to challenge a team from Nevada. Scroll down for video . Little League International has stripped Jackie Robinson West of their national title after an investigation revealed that some of the players did not live in the right district to play for the team. Members of the team pictured above with President Obama and First Lady Michelle on November 6, 2014 . Pitcher Mo'ne Davis' (pictured) team from Philadelphia lost out to Jackie Robinson West in the semi-finals of the U.S. championship . In a stunning Wednesday announcement that came months after Jackie Robinson West captured the attention of the country and the hearts of its hometown, the baseball organization said it also found that after the boundaries were changed, league officials went to surrounding leagues to convince them to go along with what they'd done. 'This is a heartbreaking decision,' Stephen D. Keener, the Little League International president and CEO, said in a statement. 'As painful as it is, we feel it is a necessary decision to maintain the integrity of the Little League program. No team can be allowed to attempt to strengthen its team by putting players on their roster that live outside their boundaries.' The team's manager, Darold Butler, has been suspended from Little League activities, according to the statement. The investigation began when a suburban coach alleged the team had violated rules by poaching top players from nearby suburbs. The story, which was first reported by DNAinfo.com, appeared to end in December when the national organization said it had uncovered no violations. But in February, the organization revealed that it had reopened the investigation after receiving new information. League officials did not immediately return calls for comment. Throughout the investigation, the team has maintained that no cheating occurred. The revelation was made after a suburban coach alleged that the team violated the rules by poaching players from nearby communities.

Runner-up Las Vegas team Mountain Ridge Little League suggested that because of allegations, the Chicago team should be stripped of its 2014 title. Mountain Ridge President Kristi Black said that the team's U.S. title 'has an asterisk on it like the one on Barry Bonds' home run record', according to DNAinfo. She added that the Las Vegas team 'rightfully deserves to be recognized as the legitimate team that went the farthest'. Jackie Robinson West captured the attention of the country last summer for becoming the first team composed entirely of black players to win the U.S. championship. The team beat Las Vegas in the U.S. Championship, 7-5, to advance to the World Series where they faced Seoul, South Korea. The Nevada team had beaten Jackie Robinson West earlier in the tournament, 13-2. Despite their loss to a South Korean team in the World Series, the little leagues still earned a trip to the White House to meet President Barack Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama, according to Washington Post. Runner-up Las Vegas team Mountain Ridge Little League (pictured) suggested that because of allegations, the Chicago team should be stripped of its 2014 title . But since the games ended, groups from neighboring areas, as well as Mountain Ridge Little League, accused the team's officials of poaching standout players from other districts. Allegations have been made that Jackie Robinson West officials created a roster filled with all-star ringers, including players from the suburbs, and secretly expanded league boundaries in a move that helped the team win the title, according to DNAinfo. New evidence was revealed last week when Little League officials met in Chicago, said DNAinfo. In 2013, Chicago's District 4 league, which included Jackie Robinson West, agreed on 'clearly defined' boundaries. Jackie Robinson West's 2014 boundaries, however, allegedly infringed on the territory of other leagues that was protected under Little League International agreements. After winning the U.S. Championship, the team made a failed attempt to ask sister leagues to change boundaries without Little League International's permission, according to DNAinfo. Per the organization's rules, boundary changes must be approved by district league presidents before they are submitted to the international organization. Jackie Robinson West's neighboring districts claim that the team expanded their league's boundaries to take over sections of three sister leagues to pick up star players.","Some players on Jackie Robinson West lived outside the team's district, and should not have been eligible to play .

And perhaps Hilary Mantel drew inspiration from her own volatile childhood, with the author revealing the unconventional nature of her parents' relationship and the impact it had on her. The Wolf Hall author, 62, has told of how her mother moved her lover into the family home with Hilary, seven, and her two younger brothers, but how her father did not move out for another four years. Scroll down for video . Wolf Hall author Hilary Mantel has told how the unconventional nature of her parents' relationship had a lasting impact . She also spoke candidly about their feelings towards each other, claiming her mother turned her against her father, so when he did leave, Hilary, then 11, never saw him again. Appearing on a television chat show, she revealed how her life has been shaped by her battle with a severe form of endometriosis, which has left her unable to have children. A guest on Skavlan last week, which broadcasts in Norway and Sweden, she told viewers: 'We had an odd family. When I was seven my mother moved her lover into the house and my father stayed. It was very strange because it was a small house but they managed to live on separate circuits. 'They stayed in this situation for four years. We lived in a small village with everyone gossiping about them and as soon as I put my foot outdoors everyone was asking me what was happening like 'Who sleeps where?' 'I did not know why they were asking this question so I learnt to shut down and not to give anything away. I did not lie on their behalf I just stayed silent really. The Booker Prize-winning novelist is currently having her work adapted for television in BBC2's Wolf Hall (pictured) 'My real father became more and more like a ghost in our lives until he faded away entirely. At the time I had no idea he had gone. My mother for her own reasons had turned me against him and I believed he did not want any contact but now you see I don't know whether that was true.' She has previously explored the complex relationship of her mother Margaret, father Henry Thompson and step-father Jack Mantel, in her memoir, Giving Up the Ghost, published in 2003. An adaptation of Dame Hilary Mantel's Man Booker Prize winning novel Wolf Hall is currently on BBC2. The fourth episode of the six-part series will be shown tonight. Being interviewed on Skavlan, she revealed how she hoped the book would reconnect her with her real father. She said: 'When I wrote my first memoir I hoped it would bring the real information to me and it did because I found out what had happened for the rest of his life. I found he married again, a widow, and he had six children, five of them were girls. 'The eldest daughter was the same age as me. She knew I existed but I did not know she did. By that time my father had died. She helped fill in some of the missing years and she gave me back very few of his possessions and his little travelling chess set which was the object in the whole world that I associated with him. It is quite damaged, battered by the years but inside were the chess men as they always were.' Ms Mantel also opened up about her struggle with her medical condition endometriosis and her inability to have children . She also opened up about how she has struggled with her health since she was a teenager and how, for years, was left without a diagnosis. Miss Mantel, who is married to Gerald McEwen, suffers from a condition called endometriosis, which causes tissue that behaves like the lining of the womb to be found outside the womb. It symptoms include chronic pain and fertility problems. She said: 'I have been ill a lot in my life. When I was 19 I realised there was something physically wrong and the doctors were very unhelpful. And basically they told me it was all in my mind and that I did not have a disease but there was. 'When I was 27 I was discovered to have a gynaecological condition which affects young women which is quite common. But by the time the disease had been given a name a great deal of damage had been done to my body. It is something I have had to live with lifelong and it is only in the last few years that I have recovered my life. 'It did influence the course of my life. I probably would not have been a writer if it had not been for this. When I was 22 I thought I must have a career and I started writing seriously but being in chronic pain does not make you saintly. 'It makes you shut down and you only have a little bit of energy so you have to ration it and you work twice as hard as other people to prove you are good to other people. Your life becomes just ambition and you don't have any fun but I have had more fun in the last year than I have had in my life.'","Wolf Hall author Hilary Mantel revealed the impact of her volatile childhood .

"Plans to force high school girls in Indonesia to pass virginity tests in order to be allowed to graduate were met with fierce criticism by campaign groups and Muslim leaders. The district council in Jember in East Java province was said to be drafting 'good conduct' regulations that would have forced girls at high schools to prove they had not had sex before they graduated. However the proposals were met with fierce criticism from campaigners and Muslim leaders who said they discriminated against  girls, and the plans were eventually dropped. Proposals to make girls from Indonesian high schools have a virginity test to prove they have not had sex before they are allowed to graduate have been met with criticism by human rights campaigners (file picture) Indonesia, home to the world's largest Muslim population, places a high value on virginity. Last year Indonesian officials admitted doing virginity tests on women seeking to join the police or military even though the practice has no scientific validity, according to the World Health Authority. The proposals to introduce virginity tests in Jember have now been dropped, but local lawmakers defended the plans and said they hoped they would be extended across the area - home to 2.3million people. 'If they're not virgins any more, don't let them pass,' local lawmaker Mufti Ali was quoted as telling . news site Berita.Jatim.com. 'We can't test the boys ... but at least with the . regulation, girls will be afraid. The boys will be prevented . from the act because girls will become unwilling.' Indonesia's top Muslim clerics opposed the proposal, saying . it discriminated against female students and was contrary to . Islamic teachings. Jember's council deputy speaker Ayub . Junaidi apologised and dropped the proposals amid widespread public condemnation of the plan. 'On behalf of the Jember Consultative Council we'd like to . apologise to the public, especially to all women and girls . across Indonesia,' he told local news site Kompas.com. The proposals were quietly abandoned in Jember, East Java province, after widespread public criticism . Campaign group Human Rights Watch welcomed the decision to halt the proposals but spokesman Andreas Harsono said it was . alarming that the test was still used by the police and . military. The group has called for an end to tolerance of the tests in the country. Mr Harsono added: 'It should be stopped ... it is degrading. It isdiscriminatory. It is cruel.' Indonesia's police force came under fire three months ago . for admitting it administered virginity tests for female police . applicants to see if their hymen was intact. A police spokesman . said the tests were part of a routine health check but there was . no requirement for women to be virgins and no discrimination. In December Home Affairs Minister Tjahjo Kumolo announced aspiring civil servants and public administrators will no longer be required to undergo the test, but the police force refused to withdraw it. The practice, which is supposed to determine if the candidate's hymen is intact, has been widely discredited as unscientific and degrading. Previous attempts to introduce virginity tests for female . students, in South Sumatra in 2013 and in West Java in 2007, . also backfired.","District council in East Java proposed virginity tests for high school girls .

"A retired soldier who sued Burger King after he found two needles in his sandwich has reached an out of court settlement with the fast food chain. Clark Bartholomew, a retired Army sergeant, claimed one needle pierced his tongue after biting into a Triple Stacker and the other lodged in his small intestine, requiring hospital treatment. Despite the settlement a trial is still set to go ahead against the U.S. Army and Air Force Exchange, which operates the franchise on Schofield Barracks, Honolulu, where the burger was bought in 2010. The exact terms of the settlement reached this week were confidential, but Bartholomew's lawyer, Paul Saccoccio, said it involves releasing Burger King Corp, and the food service company that provided the meat, from the lawsuit. FILE - In this 2009 file photo provided by Tanya Bartholomew, her husband, former army soldier, Clark Bartholomew, carries their son Aric at Fort Drum, N.Y. A settlement has been reached in Bartholomew¿s lawsuit over needles in a Burger King sandwich purchased at a Hawaii Army base . 'We're confident in our case against the Burger King at Schofield,' Saccoccio said. 'We're just trying to focus the issues and we move forward. We did it for judicial economy.' There have been several settlement attempts since the lawsuit was filed. When Bartholomew failed to attend one of the settlement conferences, a judge ordered him to pay nearly $8,500 in sanctions. Government attorneys have said previously that the case should be dismissed because Bartholomew was injured during the course of his military service. A judge refused to throw out the case. Attorneys representing the defendants didn't immediately respond to requests for comment. Bartholomew now lives in Chantilly, Virginia. He and his family will have to return to Hawaii for the trial in federal court in Honolulu. Bartholomew bought the offending Triple Stacker from a Burger King franchise at Schofield Barracks, Honolulu . A witness list filed by his attorneys indicates doctors and other medical professionals who treated Bartholomew are expected to testify. Bartholomew is expected to testify about what he suffered, including the nine days it took for one needle to move through his body.","Clark Bartholomew sued Burger King after finding two needles in burger .

"They look like something from a science fiction film in the Seventies, but these unusual 'sea suites' could be the holiday accommodation of the future. A designer has come up with a concept for egg-like villas which can be used as houseboats, floating lodges and beach houses plopped right on the sand. The 'mini island' concept from Henry Ward was shortlisted in the International Yacht and Aviation Design Awards 2014 and now the designs could become a reality. But even the most basic two-bedroom model with cost from £750,000 ($115,000). Scroll down for video . Henry Ward has put forward plans for mobile pods - houses on the sea that can cater for large groups and families . The Sea Suite series was shortlisted in the International Yacht and Aviation Design Awards 2014 . Even the guest bathroom offers a hot tub, and the decor and design is of a high standard . The floating lodge, with dimensions of 160ft long, by 40ft and 26ft, is enough to recreate a two-bedroom living space with panoramic windows, decking and its own balcony terrace with ocean views. There is even the chance to customise the design with plunge pools and Jacuzzis on the terrace, log fires in the lounge and even skylights for stargazing at night. And if you want to add in an undersea room, you'll need to shell out another £98,000 ($150,000). The luxury space is envisaged as the perfect pod escape on the banks of a river or shores of a lake, or could be bought up as part of a cluster hotel/studio development. Taking the concept a step further, the design team alongside BMT Asia Pacific 'cracked the egg' to create a two-storey version of the original pod, complete with terracotta roof and a deck that encircles the whole design. The loft-style houseboat has stepped mezzanine levels leading up to a master bedroom and even more expansive windows to take in the surrounding views. And each pod can house a private rear terrace, reached from the lounge, study, kitchen, 'snug' and dining areas alongside the bedrooms. The lodge offers luxury accommodation that is sure to appeal to those who love to spend days out at sea . The luxury space is envisaged as easily at home along lake or river side, or a part of a cluster hotel/studio development . The high levels of roof insulation, moderation of temperature from its water setting and potential addition of solar panels to the expansive roof creates a sustainable unit for all climates . Additional cabins provide significant accommodation for families and guests, while a secluded roof deck allows sunbathing or stargazing alike. Ward, 25, said: 'This form maximises internal volume for surface area and creates a series of attractive shapes and spaces, but is also readily transportable to almost any site accessible by sea. 'We've just scraped the surface of the design flexibility available, from individual houseboat and lakeland lodge to resort cabin, marina office, beach house, and even art galleries and other novel commercial spaces.' As well as the standard facilities of a normal home, there are added luxuries like a hot tub, circular balcony as well as panoramic viewing . Ward's designs offer a modern and luxury floating space that bring a real feeling of being at one with the ocean, while being safe . You could get used to a view like this on waking every morning in the floating houseboat designed by Henry Ward and partners . Richard Colwill, managing director of BMT Asia Pacific who co-designed the pods added: 'In the same way that an egg provides a flexible base for many recipes, we see countless opportunities in the development of this design for private or commercial use. 'The familiar, yet innovate form could be readily deployed along river and coastal sites, and a beach house variant has even been developed. 'We look forward to working with individuals and companies on the deployment of our firsts units, and are sure that the variety of applications ultimately created will significantly expand upon our preliminary designs.' A mobile home with a difference! This woulnd't be a bad spot to pitch up and soak in some rays in your beach pod . The designs follow plans to develop a roll-out mini-island that offers your very own personal paradise. Measuring some 33ft by 26ft when deployed, Ward's 'Recreational Island' is a folding, floating platform, which can be stored in the tender bay of a large yacht and opened out when needed.

"Are you reading this on your phone? It could well be giving you 'tech neck' - creases developed from constant tablet use. A reported rise in the number of women undergoing non-surgical facial rejuvenation treatments - like energy assisted skin tightening and neck Botox - is apparently down to a new phenomenon called ‘phone face'. Aesthetic practitioners believe that the nation’s love of their smart phones is behind the sharp increase in women opting for facial rejuvenation treatments, as patients flock to correct the damage caused by looking down at their devices - often for hours at a time. Scroll down for video . Sarah Weiss, 39, (left, before, and, right, after her procedure) felt she looked old beyond her years due to using dating apps like Tinder regularly. She opted for a non-surgical facial rejuvenation treatment to beat her so-called 'tech neck' Constant texting, flirting on Tinder, checking Facebook and even playing popular games like Candy Crush have all been attributed to the rise in women seeking rejuvenation treatments to improve the look of their lower face and neck. 'We’re inundated with patients turning to non-invasive treatments like Botox and Exilis skin tightening in the hope of correcting the effects of ""phone face"" or mobile overuse,' explains Dr Lamia Eltohamy, a facial rejuvenation expert from Cavendish Clinic & Medispa in London. 'Every week we are visited by patients hoping to erase the neck creases they’ve developed as a result of spending so much time on device like iPhones and Kindles. She continued: 'Many of them blame dating apps like Tinder, which some love-struck clients have told us they spend hours a day on. 'Our patients know where the lines have come from, but would rather seek treatment than give up using their technology.' Mary Jenson, 59, believes that she developed tech neck after regularly using FaceTime to speak to her daughter (Pictured: left, before and right, after) Experts in the beauty industry claim that Botox  smooths out horizontal lines on the neck. When injected into the platysma muscles - the strip of muscles that stand out from the neck when you grimace - it releases the tension and improves how the neck looks; both vertically and along the horizontal lines. Exilis, meanwhile, is a handheld device, which beauticians say boosts and stimulates collagen production - helping skin look more plump and fresh for up to 24 months. It also promises to tighten the skin, making it appear more firm. Two women underwent the 30-minute £300 Exilis skin tightening treatment to beat their neck creases. Exilis is a handheld device, which claims to boost and stimulate collagen production and plump the neck area . Apparently painless, the radiofrequency energy penetrates the skin and promises to offer an instant effect, although the full results can take several weeks to appear. Speaking about the reason why she opted for it, Mary Jenson, 59, from London, explained: 'Just because I’m a bit older people, assume I don’t use technology or have a device like an iPhone, but that’s not the case. 'I actually chose to have skin tightening around my jawline after seeing myself on FaceTime, a mobile app used like Skype to video chat. 'I use it to talk to my daughter now she has moved abroad, but I was horrified when I saw myself on my iPhone. 'Since getting the device, I spend a lot of time texting my family and using social media to stay in touch with them so when I visited the clinic they weren’t surprised by my neck lines and creased skin around and under my jaw. 'I had four sessions on my lower face to improve the firmness of the skin and it has improved my self-esteem a lot.' The second lady, Sarah Weiss, 39, from Essex, felt she looked old beyond her years. She said: 'I decided to try it because I felt like I looked older than I was. 'I’m always on my phone - especially dating websites like Tinder and Plenty Of Fish as I’m currently single - and I work in an office as a typist, so I look down a lot. 'Having this facial rejuvenation treatment has reduced the ""waddle"" I had around my neck and reduced the crows feet around my eyes caused by squinting at my phone or screen.' The clinic believes the rise shows that patients would rather adapt with their technology than lose it altogether. Dr Eltohamy concluded: 'We have patients coming to us now from all over the UK in search of the best treatments for natural looking answers to 21st century problems. 'The days of wind tunnel-esque facelifts to lift the skin on the face are long gone and we’ve entered into an age where looking youthful is more desirable than younger.'","Handheld devices blamed for sharp rise in radiofrequency neck lifts .

"This is the incredible moment a snowmobiler in the back country in Wyoming was buried under an avalanche he triggered - and was saved by his quick-thinking friends. The video - taken from a helmet cam by Mike Salmon, shows the snowmobiler speeding up a steep mountainside covered with virgin snow. Then, in an instant, the disaster strikes. Almost in slow motion, a wide swath of snow breaks loose from the mountain and begins to crash down the side, swallowing the rider under a massive wall. This is the moment that an avalanche caught a snowmobile rider who was climbing a mountainside on virgin snow in the back country of Wyoming . In an instant, the snomobiler was swallowed in a wall of white as the avalanche came crashing down the mountainside . Mr Salmon uploaded the harrowing footage to YouTube, where it has already been viewed by nearly 55,000 people. He writes that the avalanche occurred last Friday outside Afton, Wyoming - near the Idaho border. As the avalanche tumbled down the mountain, Mr Salmon and the other snowmobilers quickly realized that it could bury them, as well - despite them taking up a post several hundred yards away. They quickly drove away from the avalanche until the snow came to a rest. Then within seconds, they spotted their friend's snowmobile, which was on its side with a ski sticking out of the snow. Just a few feet away, the was the rider - who had miraculously come to a rest with his helmet sticking out. As his friends work to dig him out, it's clear he's shaken up but uninjured. Mr Salmon writes that the rider was wearing an airbag device - which inflates and helps keep avalanche victims at the top of the pile - but he was jostled before he could pull the rip cord and inflate it. When the rider's friends realized that the avalanche was coming for them, too, they quickly sped off away from the mountain . Quick-thinking: The rider's friends quickly spotted a helmet poking out of the snow and worked to uncover him . The man was badly shaken, but not injured by the harrowing experience .","The incredible footage was filmed in Afton, Wyoming .

While Star Wars costumes were welcomed, Darth Vader was banned because no black was allowed. The former housekeeper at the University Hospital of Wales, who leaves behind his four daughters - Lisa, Louise, Leanne and Cerianne – had requested that anyone who attended his funeral embraced his two passions – Star Wars and Liverpool FC. His widow Marilyn, 54, said: 'He was mad on Star Wars. We went to see the first film in 1977 and ever since then he was fixated with it. 'We used to go to shows and he had a signed photograph of bounty hunter Boba Fett on the wall. He had Star Wars lightsabers, figurines, cookie jars, the lot.

"A man and woman in Florida are lucky to be alive after they fell asleep in a dumpster while intoxicated and had to be rescued after it was later emptied into a garbage truck. Hillsborough County Sheriff's officials say the couple had been sleeping in a dumpster outside a Wawa gas station near Tampa early on Wednesday. When the dumpster was emptied into the back of a Progressive Waste Solutions garbage truck, they started screaming and banging on the sides of the truck. Florida couple Donald Jordan, 37, and Lisa Spirella, 49, are lucky to be alive after they fell asleep in a dumpster while intoxicated . The couple awoke and started to scream when the dumpster was emptied into the back of a Progressive Waste Solutions garbage truck (stock photo) 'I was picking up some containers,' driver Radmas Valasquez told cops, reports The Smoking Gun. 'I got two people, I don’t know how they got in the back of the truck. But they stuck in the truck.' Valasquez said he was due to compact the trash when he heard the screams from inside the truck. 'I almost killed both of them,' he said. Rescue crews had to be called about 5 a.m. after the driver was unable to remove 37-year-old Donald L. Jordan and 49-year-old Lisa Spirella from the truck. Police believe the couple - who are from KIssimmee, some 75 miles away - got highly intoxicated while visiting the nearby Seminole Hard Rock & Casino and decided to take a nap in the dumpster. They were taken to Tampa General Hospital after complaining of back pain. 'It was originally believed that they were homeless, but it seems they were just really intoxicated after hanging out at the casino,' said a HCSO spokesperson.

"A grandfather-of-three has been awarded £5,000 compensation after being assaulted and falsely charged by police under a 168-year-old law. Eddie Blakeway, 49, was falsely imprisoned while he attended Halesowen police station in the West Midlands to complete a form to report how his son had been the victim of a hit-and-run. Following a disagreement about identity documentation required to go with the form, the part-time lorry driver was wrestled to the floor, handcuffed and locked in a cell for more than nine hours. Scroll down for video . Caught on CCTV: Eddie Blakeway, 49, was falsely imprisoned while he attended Halesowen police station in the West Midlands to complete a form on behalf of his son, who had been the victim of a hit-and-run incident . Taken down: Following a disagreement about documentation to be included with the form, the part-time lorry driver was wrestled to the floor, handcuffed and locked in a cell for more than nine hours . Mr Blakeway - who suffers from back pain following an accident at work - was then charged with being violent in a police station contrary to section 29 of the Town and Police Clauses Act (1847). He pleaded not guilty at court and prosecutors dropped the case at his trial in March 2010. He then pursued a compensation claim against West Midlands Police and settled out of court in December. The grandfather said trouble began in October 2009 after he gave the form to the duty officer, who refused to take it and said his son's ID documents were required - which he did not have on him. Mr Blakeway, who then asked to talk to the inspector in charge, added: 'When the inspector arrived, he said I was being aggressive and asked me ""to get out of his station"".

Mr Blakeway, who is also a father-of-two, instructed police claims solicitor Iain Gould to pursue his compensation bid for false imprisonment and assault by the officers in Birmingham County Court. Mr Gould said: ‘My client merely complained about poor service. His reward was an unprovoked and painful arrest; detention in a cold, stark cell; and the stress of a criminal prosecution. Process: Mr Blakeway agreed to £5,000 out of court 'rather than trouble the jury any longer', his solicitor said . West Midlands Police spokesman said the jury 'found, as a matter of fact, that Mr Blakeway had not been told that he was under arrest and, therefore, as a matter of law, his arrest and all that followed was unlawful' ‘Mr Blakeway took the case to trial to clear his good name, especially in front of his wife who stood by him throughout. He agreed only £5,000 out of court rather than trouble the jury any longer.’ A West Midlands Police spokesman said: ‘The jury found, as a matter of fact, that Mr Blakeway had not been told that he was under arrest and, therefore, as a matter of law, his arrest and all that followed was unlawful. 'In those circumstances, it followed that any touching of Mr Blakeway by an officer amounted to an assault. 'In addition, the jury found that the inspector had not taken hold of Mr Blakeway’s left wrist and that Mr Blakeway walked to the custody suite. Mr Blakeway’s allegations of intentional assault and malicious prosecution were not found to be proven.’ She added: ‘There was an internal investigation into the actions of the sergeant regarding Mr Blakeway, but no action was taken against him as the complaint was not upheld.

"A rail union boss was thrown off a live radio programme after making an offensive rant at the show’s presenter. Steve Hedley, assistant general secretary of the RMT, repeatedly asked Nick Ferrari: ‘Have you stopped beating your wife?’ The LBC radio host had been quizzing Mr Hedley about a Tube strike in support of a driver sacked for failing two alcohol breath tests. The exchange began when Mr Ferrari asked: ‘Why are you supporting a drunk driver?’ On-air row: Broadcaster Nick Ferrari was forced to cut off union leader Steve Hedley today after he ranted about a Tube strike and asked the LBC presenter: 'Have you stopped beating your wife?' As Mr Ferrari pressed for an answer, an increasingly irate Mr Hedley replied with the wife-beating remark. When Mr Ferrari protested that he was a divorced man, Mr Hedley asked if he’d stopped beating his ex-wife. The mock question about domestic violence is often used to flag up a question that condemns the person who answers it no matter what reply is given. Mr Hedley said he was making a point about being asked for a straight yes or no answer in a complex situation. There is no suggestion that Mr Ferrari ever beat his wife. Mr Hedley was speaking in support of Alex McGuigan who allegedly failed the breath tests before starting work on the Northern Line. ‘He wasn’t drinking at work and he wasn’t drunk,’ he said, insisting that the driver’s diabetes could have led to a false reading. But when the union chief kept asking the same question about wife-beating, Mr Ferrari took him off air. Mr Ferrari calmly told him: ‘Goodbye Mr Hedley. I just find that offensive. You had really interesting points to make there. ‘Clearly you are unhappy with the test. Clearly, it may have been poorly administered. Your colleague, I think, appears to have diabetes. If he does and that’s why he failed his test, I will be there to support him.’ But he added: ‘Your vile and abusive stance means I never wish to speak to you again. You have diminished the case of your colleague immeasurably.’ Mr Hedley, from East Ham, east London, is one of the union movement’s most controversial characters and has caused offence with Facebook posts. One, which emerged during his failed attempt to succeed Bob Crow as RMT chief, showed him in a Soviet-style military hat with an assault rifle in his hand. His Facebook page contains status updates glorifying Tube strikes, with one post reading: ‘It’s taken me three hours to drive eight miles: mission accomplished, gridlock achieved, victory to the RMT.’ Mick Cash won the race to lead the RMT in the election for general secretary last autumn. Announcing the strike action in London on Tuesday he said: ‘Our members have voted for industrial action and the union will now consult extensively with our representatives before deciding on our next moves in this dispute.’ London Underground had urged union members to vote against strikes. Spokesman Nigel Holness said: ‘Strike threats will not alter our commitment to safety, nor will they make us consider reinstating a driver who failed two alcohol breath tests. Gun-toting militant: RMT assistant general secretary, Steve Hedley, was a contender for the union leadership but lost to Mick Cash . ‘We operate a zero tolerance approach towards the consumption of alcohol in order to keep customers and staff safe. You wouldn’t let someone who had been drinking alcohol drive your family in a car, and we don’t let people who have been drinking alcohol drive people’s families in Tube trains.’ Mr Ferrari told the Daily Mail last night he was considering legal action. However, he added: ‘I would have to balance the fact that I would ultimately be taking money from a union that staffs a vital public service industry.’ Mr Hedley said that Mr Guigan has diabetes, which produced a 'false result', but when asked if the driver had failed an alcohol test he became irate. London Underground said that the tests take this into account. He kept asking Mr Ferrari, a divorcee who has never attacked his ex-wife: 'Have you stopped beating your wife?' - a well known loaded question used in debates about presumed guilt. The interview then descended into chaos before the union boss was cut-off. Mr Ferrari said: 'Goodbye Mr Hedley. I just find that offensive. I have tried time and time again. I have to take it that your colleague failed. 'You had really interesting points to make there. Clearly you are unhappy with the test. Clearly, it may have been poorly administered. Your colleague, I think, appears to have diabetes. If he is that and that's why he failed his test, I will be there to support him.' Messages: Mr Hedley praised 'comrades' and celebrated disruption after a precious Tube strike . Controversial: The left-winger says that Labour is no longer the true workers' party in another message . He added: 'But your vile and abusive stance means I never wish to speak to you again. And in my eyes, you have diminished the case of your colleague immeasurably. 'As an assistant general secretary, you need some form of media training. Goodbye.' Mr Hedley is one of the trade union movement's most controversial characters, causing a offence with a series of Facebook posts. One showed him in a Soviet-style miltary hat and an assault rifle in his hand and emerged as he ran to replace Bob Crow. His Facebook page is filled with status updates glorifying Tube strikes, with one post reading: 'It's taken me three hours to drive eight miles: mission accomplished, gridlock achieved, victory to the RMT.' Another post exhorts his 2,000-plus friends not to cross the picket line in a Tube strike, saying: 'If you are on our side then respect our picket lines, if you are on the Government's side you will cross the pickets and be remembered as the 21st century UDM scabs and class traitors. 'Support yourself by supporting the RMT strike.  DON'T CROSS PICKET LINES.' And yet another post, which he later took down, read: 'With three different strikes announced today, I think I'll enjoy the Easter weekend.' Friends: Mr Hendley salutes with his comrade Bob Crow, who died suddenly last year . Further posts glorify striking RMT members, while another attacked 'Dave' [sic] Miliband, saying: 'Wake up and smell the coffee, the Labour Party is well and truly over.  Vote TUSC and build a workers' party.' Millions of commuters face potential travel chaos after Tube drivers voted to strike in support of a colleague who was sacked after being found over the drink drive limit twice. Members of the Rail, Maritime and Transport union (RMT) last night voted by 299 votes to 221 to strike in support of an unnamed driver who failed two random breathalyser tests befopre going on duty. Although it is unclear when the strike will take place, it is likely to cause major disruption for many of London Underground’s four million daily commuters. The union argued that the type of breathalyser used did not account for people with diabetes. But London Underground (LU) said the breath tests were not affected by the condition. And in another post, later taken down, Mr Hedley, who is from East Ham, in east London, wrote: 'I've had to move down the carriage to escape a load of middle-class prats and their mockney accents. 'Posh people really shouldn't deliberately drop their H's in an attempt to pretend they are something they clearly are not.' After the former Israeli leader Ariel Sharon died, Mr Hedley wrote: 'Thatcher will have company in hell tonight as another war criminal snuffs it'. Meanwhile photographs on his Facebook page support the image of him as a hard-left politician. One picture shows him and Mr Crow grinning at the camera, with Mr Hedley raising his clenched fist in the universal symbol of industrial workers, while another shows him smirking in front of the Kremlin. Mick Cash eventually won the race to lead the RMT after the election last autumn.","Steve Hedley insulted Nick Ferrari in LBC interview about Tube strike .

"Want to smell like Cheryl? Now you can, as the popstar and X Factor judge releases the latest scent from her sweet-smelling collection. Mrs Fernandez-Versini, 31, saw sales of her debut scent, StormFlower, break records when she released it last year and now the star has unveiled an Eau de Toilette, too. Speaking about the £27 spritz, Cheryl said: 'For my next fragrance I wanted to introduce a twist on my original scent but to maintain its simplicity and beauty. Cheryl Fernandez-Versini  has unveiled an Eau de Toilette as part of her StormFlower fragrance range and looks flawless in the promotional beauty campaign . The star, who sat front row at the couture shows in Paris recently, has clearly taken note. She continued: 'I love the spring 2015 seasonal colour trends and these inspired me in the creation of my first Eau de Toilette, a perfect addition to my StormFlower range.' Her second offering is described as a light, feminine fragrance with fresh citrus top notes mixed with a hint of juicy lemon and sweet bergamot. Expect floral notes of rose and peony, complemented by base notes of musk and sandalwood. Cheryl's debut scent, right, broke records and now she is hoping for similar success with her new fragrance . Charitable Cheryl, who has long used her status for good, has also pledged to donate £100,000 from proceeds to Cheryl's Trust, which works with The Prince's Trust to improve the lives of young people in England. After previously fronting The Cheryl Cole Foundation, which had a similar manifesto, this is a new endeavour for the singer, who was inspired by her own success and the knowledge she was lucky to be given life-changing opportunities. The charity's website reads: 'Cheryl set up her charitable trust to significantly enhance the support available to young people, inspired by the knowledge of how lucky she was to be given the opportunities she had to succeed.' Cheryl has also pledged to donate £100,000 from proceeds to Cheryl's Trust, which works with The Prince's Trust to improve the lives of young people in England . Turning her words into action, Cheryl teamed up with youth charity, The Prince’s Trust, which was set up by Prince Charles, to help fund a new state-of-the-art centre in Newcastle, which supports disadvantaged young people in the North East. Cheryl has committed to raise £2m to help get the centre up and running. When opened, it will support almost 4,000 vulnerable young people in the North East each year to turn their lives around. Cheryl aims to help the region’s most at-risk young people, including those facing drug and alcohol abuse, homelessness, mental health problems and those leaving care. Cheryl had previously set up The Cheryl Cole Foundation, in line with The Prince's Trust - she has long been a staunch supporter of Prince Charles' youth charity . Speaking at the launch in January, she said: 'My life could have turned out very differently… I know how lucky I am. That's why I am raising money to open the new centre in Newcastle. 'I want to give back and help young people who feel like they'll never achieve anything reach their dreams and live a happy life.' Busy Cheryl recently released stills from her new video, Only Human, which has been described by many as 'the best ballad' that the former Girls Aloud star has ever recorded. Cheryl herself described it as her 'personal favourite so far' to be taken from her current album of the same name, and the song drops on 22nd March. Cheryl Fernandez Versini looked bang on-trend as she arrived for Ralph & Russo's  Haute Couture show in Paris at the end of last month .","Cheryl, 31, has added a £27 Eau de Toilette to her fragrance brand .

"Pulitzer Prize-winning photographer Vincent Laforet ascended 10,800 feet in a helicopter to capture these breathtaking images high above Sin City. The project, entitled AIR: Sin City 10.8K is a follow up to the series, which he released in January, that showed New York City's lights from the sky. According to Laforet, the attraction for people to see such aerial shots stems from the fact that these types of photographs allow them to see something they 'haven't really seen before.' Scroll down for video . Pulitzer Prize-winning photographer, Vincent Laforet, recently ascended 10,800 feet to shoot the Las Vegas skyline from the air . Sitting in a helicopter, with his feet dangling out the open door, Laforet snapped stunning photographs of the Strip from above . The project, entitled AIR: Sin City 10.8K is a follow-up to his New York City photo series, which showed the Big Apple from staggering heights . In fact, Laforet believes that 'no photographer has ever shot a city from this height at night.' Speaking to Mashable, he said: 'From that high, this one little strip of like, Eiffel Towers, it looks like a Monopoly board.' 'It looks like a toy set. It's a little strip of like, 20 or 40 hotels, you know? It's a joke. 'When you're flying up there, you're flying into space, there is nothing, its pure black. And there's this one, shining expanse of a grid. Its the closest thing I've ever seen to an actual computer chip.' Because Las Vegas is surrounded by desert, with obviously have no lights, it looks as though the city is its 'very own planet' from above . Similar to how a large expanse of ocean looks from the air, the photographs abruptly turn to black when the desert comes into view . Laforet compares the multi-coloured city lights, which appear as though they are part of a grid, to that of a computer chip . Laforet says that the tiny little Eiffel Towers, hotels, and ferris wheels remind him of a Monopoly board when shot from such high elevation . Laforet was also sure to capture a variety of behind the scenes photographs, such as this one, as he sits at the edge of the aircraft . The entire ascent took about 45 minutes to reach the high altitude and Laforet travelled with his assistant and, of course, a qualified pilot . Next up for Laforet? He hopes to continue his series of cities from above and photograph Rio de Janeiro, Hong Kong and London in the future . Aside from the high-altitude shots, Laforet has also included several behind the scenes images, chronicling his journey. The entire ascent took about 45 minutes and once the aircraft reached almost 11,000 feet, Laforet opened the door of the helicopter to hang his legs out while snapping away. And there's no stopping Laforet. For his next photo series, he hopes to shoot in cities such as Rio de Janeiro, Hong Kong and London, to name a few. He also plans to announce when he will be travelling to new places to encourage other people to contribute their own aerial photos, adding a collaborative element to the project.","Pulitzer Prize-winning photographer Vincent Laforet took to the skies at night to capture these breathtaking shots .

"Former Noiseworks frontman Jon Stevens, 53, is accused of assaulting Jodhi Meares, 43, at their home in Sydney's exclusive Point Piper on Monday night. Police confirmed that officers arrested a man in his 50s at a Wolseley Road property  in the early hours of the morning before charging him with assault. The New Zealand-born star was released on bail and is reportedly set to appear in Waverley Local Court relating to the incident on Thursday. Scroll down for video . Fashion designer Jodhi Meares was allegedly assaulted by her fiancee Jon Stevens at her home on Monday . Police confirmed that officers arrested a man in his 50s at a Wolseley Road property in the early hours of the morning before charging him with assault. Pictured: Meares' home in Point Piper . Stevens will appear in court on Thursday after police issued an Apprehended Violence Order (AVO) on behalf of Meares. Just last week the couple put on a united front at the David Jones Autumn/Winter fashion launch . Just last Wednesday the pair presented a united front at a David Jones fashion event in Sydney. According to reports from Channel Nine, the incident allegedly occurred after the former wife of James Packer discovered text messages on Jon's phone. Jodhi is believed to have sustained minor injuries on her wrist. The Sydney Morning Herald reported the police were called to the couples' home after the fight and immediately issued an interim AVO, forbidding the Jezebal hitmaker from going near Jodhi for 28 days. The former INXS rocker was arrested and charged with assault. It is believed the AVO could be dropped. The rocker had been due to play several gigs this week, including Rooty Hill RSL on Friday night and Revesby Workers Club on Saturday night, but the shows have now been cancelled, with concert-goers offered refunds. Only last week Jon and Jodhi seemed to be very much together, with the musician lashing out at detractors online, in defence of his fiancee Jodhi in some fiery posts on Facebook. Meares' last social media post (pictured), uploaded onto her Instagram page on Tuesday night, was a motivational logo . Last week the couple were in the audience of the David Jones Autumn/Winter launch. It was Meares' first public appearance since the drink driving scandal (pictured) that plagued the latter half of her 2014 . Happier times: Meares' Instagram page is full of pictures and selfies of Stevens, including this one from a week ago, captioned: 'My Johnny- playing me a new song he's been working on. Oh to be that talented' Last week the 43-year-old was spotted wearing both an engagement and wedding ring while out in Rose Bay . It is yet another public drama Jodhi Meares will feel she could do without after her drink driving crash in June 2014. The fashion designer appeared in court in August, but escaped with just a 12-month driving ban and a fine for $1,100, despite recording a blood alcohol level of 0.181 and rolling her Range Rover. Her lawyer said the former model weighed about 48.5 kilograms and had drunk 'about four and three-quarter' glasses of red wine over four and a half hours and eaten just a small piece of lamb. At the time, her solicitor Chris Murphy said Meares had been 'haunted' by her marriage to Packer, which lasted from 1999 until they separated in 2002. 'She was married for just over two years [to James Packer] and that haunts everything that's said  about it [the marriage],' he said. 'She's not a celebrity, she's not a movie star. She was raised by a single mother. They moved apartments every four months. There were four children, she went to three different high schools. 'She had the good fortune to make money in modelling, and in the late 90s, she created the label Tiger Lily, and married Jamie Packer.' Pictured together in mid January: The incident allegedly occurred after the former wife of James Packer discovered text messages on Jon's phone. Jodhi is believed to have sustained minor injuries on her wrist . Jon recently showed support for his fiancee by slamming users on Facebook who took the opportunity to criticise Jodhi for her recent car accident . On the Upside: When some commenters confused Jodhi as Jon's daughter, he replied that his fiancee was flattered by the mistake . Just last week, an account in the name of Jon Stevens didn't take well to some people on social media criticising Johdi for the drink driving incident. One user commented: 'Hope she doesn't get p***** & stack her 4wd afterwards.' Stevens hit back, writing: 'Hope you don't choke on your own vomit.' He wasn't finished there, the rant posted in the early hours of Thursday continuing: . 'Your poor taste just shows what a pathetic person you must be ... as with everyone makes mistakes and nobody got hurt in Jodhi's accident thank god ... and she completely put her hand up and took full responsibility for her actions which I reckon you don’t know how to do that coz you must be perfect? But I doubt it very much as clearly you are a very boring person that has never made a mistake in your life...' The user  replied: 'No I'm not perfect Jon but I have lost a family member through the actions of a drink driver.' Message of support: Jon posted this photo of he and Jodhi to Facebook last week after her brand The Upside featured in the David Jones Autumn/Winter fashion parade . Stevens was due to play several gigs this week but the shows have now been cancelled with concert-goers offered refunds . After crashing her car in June and recording a blood alcohol level of more than three times the legal limit, the star was fined $1,100 and banned from driving for a year .

"This is the moment a man accused of murdering Etan Patz mimed choking the life out of the six-year-old boy in a video-taped confession to cops. Pedro Hernandez wrapped his hands round his own neck and mimed squeezing in the footage, shown today to jurors who will decide whether Hernandez murdered the child in 1979. Hernandez, 54, was in the courtroom and watched the tape, in which he say he 'just couldn't let go' of the boy's neck. Scroll down for video . Acting out: A jury saw this footage of murder suspect Pedro Hernandez acting out how he allegedly killed Etan Patz in 1979 . Fiction? Hernandez's lawyer says that the taped confession is not what happened - and that Hernandez made it up because he is mentally ill . He went on to explain how he shoved Etan's body in a trash bag and dumped it on a Manhattan sidewalk after the killing. However, according to his attorney, the confession is a fiction, which Hernandez only told police because he is mentally ill. In the video he said: 'I was nervous. My legs were jumping. I wanted to let go, but I just couldn't let go. I felt like something just took over me.' 'I don't know what to say. Something just took over me, and I was just choking him.' Hernandez was a teenage stock clerk at a convenience store a few blocks from where Etan was last seen on his way to school on May 25, 1979. It was Etan's first time walking to school alone. 'I don't know why I came up to him,' Hernandez says on the tape, calmly. 'I just approached to him, and I asked him: ''You want a soda?'' Pedro Hernandez, pictured in 2012, was seen confessing to the murder of Etan Patz (right) in a videotaped confession show to the jury in court on Tuesday . 'He didn't say nothing to me, even when I was choking him. He didn't kick. He didn't do nothing. He just kind of stood there, and I just felt bad what I did.' The boy went limp, but was still alive when he disposed of the body, he said. 'He was still gasping,' Hernandez said on the videotape. The next day, he returned to the alley to look for the body but it was gone. 'I was going to throw it away in the garbage if it was still there,' Hernandez said during the taped confession. Hernandez said had never met Etan or his family before the killing. The interview took place from 2.15am until 7.15am on Thursday morning, May 24, 2012. That was about a month after authorities began a highly-publicized excavation of the basement of a Soho building in an effort to crack the cold case. Etan's father, Stanley Patz and sister Shirea sat in court as the jury was transfixed by the videotaped confession, which the defense said was coerced by police from a mentally ill man who suffers from hallucinations. Stanley Patz, the father of Etan Patz, pictured on Tuesday entering the murder trial of Pedro Hernandez at Manhattan Supreme Court in New York. Jurors were shown the videotaped confession of the man accused of killing his six-year-old son today . On the videotape, an investigator asked Hernandez what happened after he left Patz. 'I just feel like nothing, like nothing happened, like I didn't do nothing wrong,' Hernandez said. 'I know that I did something wrong, but it didn't bother me that much. I just kept working.' On the videotape, he described three previous confessions to the killing, including one to his first wife, who he told: 'I killed someone and it was a child.' Hernandez also said he confessed to a lifelong friend and a New Jersey church group. 'We were holding hands, praying,' he said on the videotape. 'I told everybody that I killed somebody.' Hernandez has pleaded not guilty to killing Etan, whose body has never been found. Stanley Patz, pictured with his daughter Shira Patz at court in New York City on Tuesday. Miss Patz has maintained absolute privacy since her brother's disappearance in 1979, to the extent that it is not known why she is in a wheelchair . The six-year-old's disappearance prompted an international search and spurred major changes in how law enforcement nationwide handle missing children reports. He was one of the first missing children whose picture appeared on a milk carton. In the tape, Hernandez also spoke about being diagnosed with bipolar disorder and taking medication for pain from an on-the-job injury from working at a dress factory in New Jersey. The confession was played in September during a hearing on whether it could be used at trial. Some personal details about Hernandez's life were removed after his attorney objected. The clip shown Tuesday is one of three confession videos made after Hernandez was arrested following a tip in May 2012. The other videos were expected to be played.

"It has faced its fair share of criticism but the second series of Broadchurch finally seems to have broken through to audiences. After five weeks in which ratings plummeted by 2.5million, Monday’s episode appears to have turned a corner, attracting 5.8million viewers, one million more than the previous instalment. Although the ITV drama has been accused of taking liberties with its depiction of police investigations and court proceedings, fans appear to have embraced the chaos, prompting the spike in ratings. Broadchurch, starring David Tennant and Olivia Colman, seems to have turned a corner in the ratings . However, it is still not being given an easy ride, with viewers questioning the accuracy of how it portrayed the medical condition of one of its main characters. With David Tennant’s downtrodden police detective going into hospital to have a pacemaker fitted, it was meant to be a dramatic highlight in the middle of the series. And with the character updating his will, warning his former wife he might die and even experiencing an eerie dream sequence while under the knife, the sense of jeopardy was markedly ramped up. But audiences did not have quite the reaction that would have been hoped for, pointing out medical inaccuracies and claiming that the procedure is not as dangerous as viewers were led to believe. One wrote: ‘Wife been yelling at the TV. Oi, Broadchurch you don’t have a general anaesthetic for a pacemaker fitting. Wife does it for a living.’ And another pointed out: ‘Oh Broadchurch, having a pacemaker put in is NOT that big a deal. My 80 year old mom was a better patient than you, Hardy.’ A third placed it in a long line of criticisms that has seen the programme’s second series rounded on by lawyers, who have taken issue with the portrayal of court proceedings. Law-student Rachel Constable tweeted: ‘Oh dear. I have a horrible feeling that pacemaker patients are about to be misrepresented as much as the legal system is!’ Despite these concerns, the episode was the most watched since the second series began last month. Monday’s episode marked a significant jump after what had been a steady period of decline throughout the hit show’s second run. There are risks associated with having a pacemaker fitted, including infections and blood clots. However, while it can be used to treat serious conditions, the procedure itself is seen as relatively safe, with some patients even allowed home on the same day as their surgery.","After five weeks in which ratings fell by 2.5million, Monday’s episode of the second series attracted one million more than the previous instalment .

"An Only Fools And Horses fan spent 40 hours and £700 getting a huge tattoo of the show inked across his body, only for Hooky Street to be misspelt. Police officer Sam Hall, 29, from Eltham, south east London, had the black and white design featuring the cast of the BBC comedy show etched onto his right ribcage over the course of two years.

"A multimillionaire investment banker who chose to expose details about the sordid affair that ended his marriage in a bid to avoid paying a $1.3 million debt now stands accused of stealing from his children's trust fund. Manhattan-based Hugh Levey, 65, 'has perpetrated frauds upon various individuals and entities — the most spectacular and malicious of which was on his own wife, Wendy Levey, and even his children,' claims his ex in a new lawsuit. 'His pillaging was so extreme that he even depleted his children's trust funds', according to the filing in Manhattan Supreme Court. Spurned wife: Wendy Levey has accused her banker husband Hugh of withdrawing more than $130,000 from his children's trust funds plus raiding $10 million from her own personal family trusts . Submitted records show that Hugh withdrew more than $130,000 from the trusts between 2001 and 2003, reports the New York Post. He is also accused of raiding $10 million from his ex-wife's own personal family trusts. Last month a Manhattan Supreme Court judge ruled that Hugh must pay up the $1.3 million he owes to a Virginia investment firm called Pensmore after he lost the money in a bad investment. Hugh had engaged in a drawn-out court battle to avoid paying during which he willingly made public documents about his 12-year affair with business partner and TV talking head Claire Gruppo. However, instead of stumping up the cash, he used documents about his highly confidential net-worth statement, which was part of his divorce from his wife of 40 years Wendy Levy. The paperwork showed that while Levey, who has a Harvard MBA, is cash poor, with $500 in a checking account, $200 cash on hand and no savings, he was worth $29 million. Affair: Documents about Hugh Levey's 12-year affair with business partner and TV talking head Claire Gruppo, pictured, were made public last month . His funds are invested in a $15 million Fifth Avenue apartment, a $5 million Greenwich home and millions in various trusts and personal items. Yet the millionaire 'deliberately keeps himself cash poor in order to avoid judgments, a trick he learned in a personal bankruptcy in the 1990s,' the Pensmore suit said. Meanwhile, despite being the co-founder of Gruppo, Levey & Co. he relies on his mistress, Gruppo, 61, to give him spending money. Pensmore is now suing Levey to force the sale of $2 million in antiques, art and jewelry listed on his net worth statement to pay off the debt. Wendy is trying to block the move, saying the personal property Hugh was ordered to auction off is her jewelry, art and antiques.","Wendy Levey has accused her banker husband Hugh of withdrawing more than $130,000 from his children's trust funds .

"Charles Baker was arrested on Tuesday in Memphis, Tennessee on rape charges . An accused rapist, who allegedly sexually assaulted a woman at gunpoint, has finally been arrested after a backlogged rape kit was tested. Charles Baker, 44, was charged with aggravated rape on Tuesday in Memphis, Tennessee - 15 years to the day that the attack took place. Baker was believed to have abducted a woman at gunpoint in 2000 in downtown Memphis and raped her. The victim consented to a rape kit 15 years ago but the evidence wasn't sent to the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation until July 2012. A positive DNA match was discovered in January 2015. According to Fox, the alleged rapist was the latest in a string of suspects caught from a backlog of 12,000 untested rape kits. Testing on the kits began in 2013 but the Memphis Police Department has struggled to get funding to process all of them. The rape kit which allegedly holds Baker's DNA was sent to the Tennessee Bureau of Investigations a year before the backlog began to be cleared. It is unclear why police wanted to test that kit in 2012. Calls to the Memphis Police Department went unanswered today. Baker is due in court on Wednesday morning.

This isn't the first time Mr Ansel has joined forces with Ferrero, the manufacturer of Nutella. In 2014, hundreds of people lined up at Madison Square Park for a tasting of Mr Ansel's Nutella Cronut holes, which he created for the 50th anniversary of the hazelnut spread. 'Last year we celebrated our 50th anniversary and were humbled by the way our fans showed their passion and love for the Nutella brand,' said the Senior Brand Manager for Nutella at Ferrero USA, Inc. 'This year we looked for another way to celebrate with them, and since Nutella makes pancakes extra special, we found International Pancake Tuesday to be the perfect opportunity to do so.'","Dominique Ansel's Nutella Pancake Cone will be available for one day only at New York City's Grand Central Station .
The treats will be handed out to the first 1,000 customers at the February 17 event .
Mr Ansel said the taste of Nutella brings him 'right back to his childhood'"
"She's famous for her love of sport but the Duchess of Cornwall got a little more than she bargained for during a visit to the 4 Rifles at their Wiltshire barracks. Camilla, who was resplendent in a bespoke dark green wool coat, was being shown around the training gym when she was invited to join some of the soldiers in their boxing ring. Gamely, the Duchess, 67, climbed into the ring where she joked with soldiers before banging fists with one of the men. Limbering up: The Duchess of Cornwall hopped into the boxing ring with members of the 4 Rifles . Speedy exit: Camilla got into the boxing ring, spent a few minutes chatting, and then got out again (right) Back to safety! Smiling slightly, the Duchess clambers back out of the ring . She had been watching the men sparring and later met a group of boxers who had travelled to Colchester the previous night to take on fighters from the Parachute Regiment. Unfortunately for the Duchess, who sources describe as being 'passionate' and 'caring greatly' about the 4 Rifles, only one boxer, Rifleman Jack Brown, managed to win his bout. It was all so very different from the formalities that marked the beginning of the visit, which saw the Duchess, who is the battalion's Royal Colonel, greeted with a traditional bugle fanfare. She then inspected the soldiers who had lined up to wait for her to arrive before being shown into the training gym. Afterwards, the Duchess was given a tour of the battalion's formidable looking arsenal of armoured vehicles, including one of the controversial Jackal 2 cars. Nice work: On her way out, she gave one of the boxers a friendly punch on the glove . Meeting: The Duchess also met some of the boxers who had taken on men from the Paras the previous night . Not so good: Unfortunately, only one of the boxers from 4 Rifles managed to win his bout with the Paras . Nice work: One who did was Rifleman Jack Brown (not pictured) - much to Camilla's delight . In 2009, faults in the original Jackal caused a furore, leading to it being dubbed 'a mobile coffin' when it was discovered that the weak chassis made it vulnerable to improvised explosive devices. The new model, in which Camilla, along with Captain Louis Rountree, sat, is, according to the Ministry of Defence, considerably better protected and carries heavy and grenade machine guns. Camilla was also shown - and hopped into - a Warrior armoured vehicle, which resembles a tank and is armed with cannons as well as machine guns. Today's visit will be the Duchess' last to the troops' Bulford barracks, with the regiment set to be relocated to the Aldershot Barracks in Hampshire this summer. The imminent move proved a popular topic of conversation when the Duchess was taken to meet some of the soldier's wives and girlfriends, as well as some of the children. Formal welcome: Camilla's visit began with a bugle welcome outside the Ward Barracks . Inspection: The Duchess then inspected the men who had lined up to wait for her arrival . Formidable: The Duchess joined Captain Louis Roundtree and took a seat in an armoured Jackal 2 vehicle . Training: Captain Rountree is in charge of training and appeared to be intent on giving Camilla the basics . Arsenal: She and Captain Rountree then got inside a huge Warrior armoured vehicle . Camilla, a grandmother of six, including Prince George, looked particularly taken with some of the younger children and at one point crouched down so one of the little girls could show off her doll. The Duchess was also on the receiving end of a bunch of flowers, which were presented by Nancy Boswell, daughter of commanding officer, Lieutenant Colonel Carl Boswell. Today's visit comes in the middle of a busy period for the Duchess who is currently without husband Prince Charles, who is touring the Middle East. Tomorrow will see her visit a school, while Friday and much of next week will also see her back on her travels within the UK. Kind-hearted: The Duchess crouched down so a little girl could show off her doll while meeting families . At ease: The Duchess, a grandmother of six, including Prince George, looked at ease with the babies . Hello there: She even stopped to tickle one little boy's foot - much to his mother's delight .

"She held out valiantly for four years but this is Enid Jones’s beloved terraced home being flattened to make way for a superstore. And her heartbreak has been compounded after it was suggested yesterday that she could have lost her home for nothing because Tesco might never build the store. The 59-year-old grandmother of two became the unlikely heroine in a battle against the multi-million-pound supermarket chain. Scroll down for video . Destroyed: Enid Jones's house, which she lived in for a decade, is demolished to make way for a Tesco superstore and car park that might not ever be built . Distraught: Mrs Jones pictured along her street in Aberystwth, Wales, before the demolition started. Her sister, Bethan, said she did not watch her house being destroyed, and may never go to the site again . Finished: A digger rests on the rubble of Mrs Jones's former home as the last pieces of the roof are torn down to make way for a multi-storey shopping complex . She made a stand against plans to turn her street in Aberystwyth, west Wales, into a multi-storey ‘shopping park’. Mrs Jones flatly refused to budge from the three-bedroom home she described as ‘her castle’, resisting developers’ generous offers and hiring a lawyer to fight her case. Having persuaded all of Mrs Jones’s 11 neighbours to sell their homes, the developers eventually applied for a compulsory purchase order from Ceredigion Council. The order was granted and last Friday a wrecking ball flattened her home in Glyndwr Road to make way for a 25,000sq ft Tesco, a 36,000sq ft Marks & Spencer and a 550-space car park. Fight: After a four-year legal battle with Tesco, in which all 11 of her neighbours sold up, Mrs Jones was forced out using a compulsory purchase order (pictured, Mrs Jones after a hearing to discuss the sale) Coming down: Despite the demolition being forced through, Tesco has recently declared it is scrapping 49 new projects amid financial woes. It is not known if this is among them . Sad: Mrs Jones, 59, who has been left living with her elderly mother while she seeks compensation from the council, is said to be 'devastated' at the loss of her home . The retired receptionist, who had been there for ten years, is said to be ‘devastated’. She is living with her elderly mother while she seeks compensation from the council. Her sister, Bethan said: ‘She was very low on the day that they demolished her house. She didn’t go down to see them doing it and don’t think she will ever go back.’ But some locals have cast doubt on whether the scheme will go-ahead citing Tesco’s financial troubles. In January this year the chain announced plans to axe 43 stores across the UK and shelve 49 new projects in an attempt to turn around its fortunes. Aberystwyth town councillor Mair Benjamin said: ‘There is a real chance this complex might not go ahead. Before: This is what the road in Aberystwyth, mid-Wales, looked like before the bulldozers rolled in . After: An artist's impression of what the site will look like after construction is complete, if it ever happens . Denial: Tesco denied the building work would be cancelled, saying the store was set to open its doors in summer next year, with a Marks and Spencer following in December 2016 . 'Tesco have already halted a number of projects and we have been watching their share price and it isn’t looking good. It would be disgraceful if all this has happened for nothing.’ But developer Chalverton, which has spearheaded the scheme, denied any plans to shelve it, saying that everyone involved was ‘100 per cent committed’. It said the Tesco store will open its doors in summer next year with Marks & Spencer following in December 2016. Tesco said: ‘We still want to build the store and we know many local people are looking forward to it opening.’ Marks & Spencer said: ‘We plan to open a store in the development next year.’","Enid Jones had lived in terraced home in Aberyswth, Wales, for a decade .

"Turnout in Scotland’s independence referendum is expected to be very high, but surely not as big as CNN was predicting on Thursday night. In a news report on the network’s evening broadcast, a graphic appeared on screen which showed that Scotland has given the independence referendum 110 percent. According to the graphic, 58 percent of Scots had said ‘yes,’ and 52 percent voted ‘no,’ which adds up to 110 percent of the country's populace. Scroll down for video . In a news report on CNN’s evening broadcast, a graphic appeared on screen which showed that Scotland has given the independence referendum 110 percent . Later, the network realized their error and switched to a more accurate graphic which showed 52 percent voting ‘no’ and 48 percent voting ‘yes’. The St. Andrew's Bar in New York City was filled to capacity on Thursday night as anxious Scots from all over the city awaited the final results of the referendum. After the polls closed late on Thursday, turnout in the referendum was expected to be extremely high – although not quite as high as CNN’s projections. The first numbers released early in the early hours of Friday morning in Scotland were turnout totals for two regions - 84 percent and 89 percent - suggesting that the number of voters could hit a record high. Later, the network realized their error and switched to a more accurate graphic which showed 52 percent voting ‘no’ and 48 percent voting ‘yes’ Eager voters had lined up outside some polling stations even before they opened on Thursday. More than 4.2 million people had registered to vote - 97 percent of those eligible - including residents as young as 16. For some, it was a day they had dreamed of for decades. For others, the time had finally come to make up their minds about the future - both for themselves and for the United Kingdom. 'Fifty years I fought for this,' said 83-year-old Isabelle Smith, a Yes supporter in Edinburgh's maritime district of Newhaven, a former fishing port. 'And we are going to win. I can feel it in my bones.' The question on the ballot could not be simpler: 'Should Scotland be an independent country?' Yet it has divided Scots during months of campaigning, generating an unprecedented volume and intensity of public debate and participation. The Yes side, in particular, has energized young people and previously disillusioned working-class voters. St. Andrew's Bar was filled to capacity as anxious Scots from all over Manhattan awaited the final results of the referendum to decide if Scotland should stay with Great Britain or become an independent nation . Polls suggest the result was too close to call. A final Ipsos MORI poll released on Thursday put support for the No side at 53 percent and Yes at 47 percent. The phone survey of 991 people has a margin of error of plus or minus three percentage points. Many questions - the currency an independent Scotland would use, its status within the 28-nation European Union and NATO, the fate of Britain's nuclear-armed submarines, based at a Scottish port - remain uncertain or disputed after months of campaigning. One thing was known: A Yes vote would trigger 18 months of negotiations between Scottish leaders and London-based politicians on how the two countries would separate their institutions before Scotland's planned Independence Day on March 24, 2016. For Smith, who went to the polling station decked out in a blue-and-white pro-independence shirt and rosette, statehood for Scotland was a dream nurtured during three decades living in the U.S. with her late husband. 'The one thing America has that the Scots don't have is confidence,' said Smith, who returned to Scotland years ago. 'But they're getting it, they're walking tall.' Cheers: After polls closed, some No campaigners said they were confident they had swayed enough undecided voters to stave off independence . After polls closed, some No campaigners said they were confident they had swayed enough undecided voters to stave off independence. They may have been helped by a last-minute offer from Britain's main political parties for more powers for Scotland if they reject secession. Yes campaigners insisted Scots would not allow a return to the status quo, even if the independence bid failed. 'Whatever happens, Scotland is going to be different,' said Luke Campbell, a member of the Radical Independence Movement. 'People aren't going to go back to their sofas after this.' After weeks in which the British media talked of little else, the television airwaves were almost a referendum-free zone Thursday due to electoral rules. On the streets, it was a different story, with rival Yes and No billboards and campaigners outside many polling places. At one Edinburgh polling station, Thomas Roberts said he had voted Yes because he felt optimistic about Scotland's future as an independent country. He was looking forward to learning the outcome from the warm confines of a pub. 'Why not roll the dice for once?' he asked. 'I'm going to sit with a beer in my hand watching the results coming in.' Pro-independence forces got a last-minute boost Thursday from tennis star Andy Murray, who signaled his support of the Yes campaign in a tweet to his 2.7 million followers . But some No supporters said the pro-independence campaign had fueled bad feeling among neighbors. 'The country is divided with a hatchet. It's so awful - and it was completely unnecessary,' said Fiona Mitchell, distributing No leaflets outside a polling station. If the Yes side prevails, First Minister Alex Salmond will have realized a long-held dream of leading his country to independence from an alliance with England that was formed in 1707. 'This is our opportunity of a lifetime and we must seize it with both hands,' Salmond said in his final pre-vote speech. Pro-independence forces got a last-minute boost Thursday from tennis star Andy Murray, who signaled his support of the Yes campaign in a tweet to his 2.7 million followers. Anti-independence leaders, including former Prime Minister Gordon Brown, himself a Scot, have implored Scots not to break their links with the rest of the United Kingdom and have stressed the economic uncertainties that independence would bring. Yes campaigners insist Scots will not allow a return to the status quo, even if their independence bid fails . There have been fierce disputes over whether an independent Scotland could use the pound and several companies have said they would move their headquarters from Scotland to England if the Yes vote prevails. Many Yes supporters were heading to symbolic spots like Calton Hill overlooking Edinburgh - hoping the sun would rise Friday on a new dawn of independence and not just a hangover. But financial consultant Michael MacPhee, a No voter, said he would observe the returns coming in 'with anxiety.' Scottish independence is 'the daftest idea I've ever heard,' he said.","CNN featured a graphic on screen on Thursday night which showed that 110 percent of the country's population had been polled .

"With Valentine's Day just around the corner one adventurous couple are raising the stakes when it comes to extravagant romantic gestures by continuing their never-ending honeymoon - which has seen them visit 24 countries so far. Jeff and Jennifer Salvage, from Medford, New Jersey, have combined their passion for travelling with their passion for romance by capturing hundreds of pictures of Jennifer in her wedding dress in various exotic locations. The intrepid couple have now clocked up more than 200,000 miles, with Jennifer, 43, playing the brushing bride over and over again while being photographed by her husband for 205 shoots in 24 countries on six continents. Scroll down for video . Jennifer Salvage, a  school guidance counsellor, gets close to a resident at Tiger Kingdom in Chiang Mai, Thailand . A serene shot from the couple's trip to Cambodia sees Jennifer with hands in prayer sitting in a moss-covered ruin . Jennifer eve goes scuba diving in the dress, swimming among vibrant coral in the world famous Great Barrier Reef in Australia . The pair began their unusual adventure after they got married more than six years ago, in 2008. And since first hitting the headlines two years ago, they show no signs of slowing down - recently ticking another five countries off their hit list: Australia, Jordan, Thailand, Cambodia and Singapore. New footage and pictures show Jennifer snorkelling in the Great Barrier Reef, riding a camel in Jordan, visiting a floating market in Thailand and swimming in the Dead Sea - all while wearing the same white wedding dress. The picture perfect bride is also captured playing with tigers at Tiger Kingdom in Phuket, braving a jungle swing in Cairns and visiting the incredible Supertree Grove in Singapore. A smiling Jennifer, wears her dress to go hiking and is captured perching on a rock on a sunny day in the Dana Reserve in Jordan .

The blushing bride relaxes, floating in the Jordanian Dead Sea while catching up on local news . Jennifer has no qualms letting a komodo dragon sit on her wedding dress in Australia . Jeff, 47, a professional photographer, said: 'The gown has shown astounding durability, travelling in a backpack, slogging through mud and snow, swimming underwater, flying in a harness, and, of course, enduring many trips to the cleaners. 'People often ask what our dry cleaning bill must be like, but because the dress is made with stretch lace over jersey it has unbelievable durability, we just take it to our $1.99 dry cleaner after each trip. 'We thought for sure the dress would have been destroyed in Jordan. It was subjected to the extremes of the desert heat, a pop-up sand storm and the corrosive waters of the Dead Sea. However, after a quick trip to the dry cleaners it was ready for more. 'People sometimes assume that we have an unlimited travel budget but we don't. Instead we travel through very cost effective means. 'Sometimes we combine trips with charity work and we have also collected hundreds of thousands of frequent flyer miles from cycling through credit card offers. 'We're more comfortable in a quaint youth hostel than a posh five star hotel and we always make our money stretch.' When they're not travelling the pair also work in schools - Jennifer as a guidance counsellor and Jeff as a computer-science professor - which means both have long summer holidays for country-hopping.

The couple pictured on a Motorcycle Tour in Ayers Rock in Australia, with Jennifer on the back of a bike wearing her dress with flip flops . After originally tying the knot on Easter Island, Chile, in 2008, the pair decided to relive their wedding in as many different locations as possible - creating a truly inspiring series of pictures dubbed One Dress. One Woman. One World which was published as a coffee table book in 2010. Jennifer's bridal gown was designed to be carried in a backpack  to suit their nuptials in the remote location of Easter Island  but the dress would be stuffed into a rucksack on hundreds of occasions after that. On their website, Jennifer explains that their adventure began when she was looking for a wedding gown to wear to the ceremony they had planned on the edge of a volcano on the South Pacific island. Since the dress would need to be 'flown over 7,000 miles, driven across an isolated island, and hand-carried up a sacred volcano crater,' Jennifer wanted one that 'could be stuffed in a backpack'. She ultimately chose a strapless Destinations by Maggie Sottero gown with white lace overlay. On  Easter Island, Jeff set about trying to capture Jennifer in her dress in the best light, an endeavor that continued on into their honeymoon in the Alps and China. Since then, the couple have embarked on photoshoots in 24 countries: Chile, Switzerland, China, the U.S., Egypt, New Zealand, Hungary, France, Italy, Vatican, Peru, Iceland, Norway, Jamaica, the Bahamas, Grand Cayman, Honduras, Greece and Russia - and now also Jordan, Singapore, Thailand, Cambodia and Australia. According to the website: 'Jennifer and her dress have travelled across the world in search of adventure, beauty, an excuse to never end her honeymoon with Jeff.' The couple say the wedding dress photos have been a fun addition to their travels as well as a way for them to commemorate their most special day. Their most recent adventures are documented in photo book called When it Clicks which is accompanied by Jennifer's memoir entitled When it Clicks - One Woman's Journey from Solo Hiker to Model Wife. Petra lights up at night thanks to hundreds of candles. Jennifer is pictured sitting and appreciating the scene's calm beauty . The unique Floating Market in Thailand is captured from a bird's eye view, with Jennifer pictured in a boat buying goods . Jeff added: 'As long as it is still fun and is bringing us together as a couple, we'll keep travelling and photographing Jennifer in the dress. 'Of course the project will evolve over time. A recent shoot ended with Jennifer fracturing her ribs, so perhaps it's time to limit the daredevil shots. 'But we're already planning our next big adventure - a summer trip to Austria, Slovenia, Croatia, and Spain. 'We didn't intend to do this. We got married in the world's most remotely inhabited place - Easter Island. The bottom line was we wanted to find the most romantic place in the world. 'I wanted iconic wedding pictures and on the day the lighting wasn't perfect so I took some more of Jen the next day, during sunrise and sunset.

'Then in the summer months that followed we went hiking in the Alps and then to China and took a few more pictures of Jen in her dress. We just thought to ourselves we should take another wedding dress picture here and there. 'We travelled through some really remote parts of China and at first people thought they had stumbled upon a wedding, then they realised it was something much cooler. 'I decided at that point to take my passion and make it our project. They're going to be great to look back on, the photos are the memories.'

"Strutting along a hospital corridor, naked from the waist up, a jealous husband heads for the intensive care ward where his wife works. Moments after this image was captured on CCTV, drug addict Royston Jones launched a savage attack on nurse Claire Jones in front of seven critically-ill patients she was treating. The jobless thug, convinced she was having an affair, repeatedly shouted ‘die’ as he tried to strangle her. He also claimed he was carrying a grenade. Caught: CCTV footage released today by police (above) shows Royston Jones, naked from the waist-up, making his way into the hospital where he attacked wife Claire in front of seven patients she was treating . Chilling: The 39-year-old was seen wandering the halls of the Nevill Hall Hospital in Abergavenny, south Wales, before entering the ward where his wife worked. Jones shouted 'die' while strangling her . Dangerous: Jones is seen entering one of the rooms in the hospital before the vicious attack . He was described to the court as being a 'jealous, possessive and aggressive man' Her colleagues heroically managed to stop the attack, though the nurse was left unconscious. One of them hit Jones, 39, with a chair while a consultant anaesthetist was kneed in the face in the fight to rescue the nurse. Prosecutor Michael Jones told Newport Crown Court: ‘He was a jealous, possessive and aggressive man who was convinced his estranged wife was in another relationship.’ Jones arrived at Nevill Hall hospital in Abergavenny, South Wales, where he knocked his 9 stone wife to the floor and was lying on top of her. Jealous: Jones, right, was found guilty of attempted murder at Newport Crown Court today. He had become convinced his wife Claire, left outside court last week, was having an affair . Saved: An unconscious Mrs Jones was only saved after her 'heroic' colleagues at Nevill Hall Hospital in Abergavenny, south Wales, hit him with a chair and managed to drag him off . Mr Jones said: ‘He had his hands around her throat and there’s no doubt he was trying to kill her. 'Were it not for the heroic intervention of staff at that hospital, he would undoubtedly have succeeded.’ Mrs Jones was dragged into another room by staff but her husband came after her and put her in a headlock. She then blacked out. The mother of three, who had separated from Jones, said: ‘He was like a man possessed. All he said to me was “You’ve done it now.” And I said: “What have I done?”.’ She was taken to the A&E unit where she was treated for a swollen neck and throat, elbow and back injuries. She later told police that she was not in a relationship when she was attacked. Hospital porters managed to restrain Jones before police arrived to handcuff him. He told officers: ‘I’ll do two years for this. The court better not let me out or I’ll finish the job.’ Jones, of Brynmawr, Gwent, had a history of drug abuse – and had taken drugs that day. He was convicted of attempted murder and remanded in custody. He will be sentenced on February 20.","Rhyston Jones, naked from waist up, was captured on hospital cameras .

"Thefts involving . smartphones have declined dramatically in three major cities . since manufacturers began implementing 'kill switches' that . allow the phones to be turned off remotely if they are stolen, . authorities said on Tuesday. The number of stolen iPhones dropped by 40 percent in San . Francisco and 25 percent in New York in the 12 months after . Apple added a kill switch to its devices in September 2013. In London, smartphone theft dropped by half, according to an . announcement by officials in the three cities. So far, Apple, Samsung and Google have implemented kill switches on their smartphones, and Microsoft is expected torelease an operating system for its Windows phones that has onethis year, the three officials said in their news release. Versions of the emergency feature are included on iPhone and Samsung handsets. A 'soft' kill switch, such as those currently offered, allow a person to block a thief from accessing their phone. This lets them disable their handset, add extra layers of security, and protect their personal data on it. Microsoft and Google will both add the feature to their next software update. Current services rely on a signal to be activated, which can be blocked if a thief turns off a phone or puts it in airplane mode straight away. 'We have made real progress in tackling the smartphone theft . epidemic that was affecting many major cities just two years . ago,' said London Mayor Boris Johnson. Johnson, San Francisco District Attorney George Gascon and . New York state Attorney General Eric Schneiderman were among . numerous officials arguing for new laws mandating the kill . switches. In California, where a law mandating kill switches has yet . to go into effect, smartphone theft is dropping because some . manufacturers have already started installing the software-based . switches on the devices they sell, Gascon said. 'The wireless industry continues to roll out sophisticated . new features, but preventing their own customers from being the . target of a violent crime is the coolest technology they can . bring to market,' Gascon said. California's law, one of the nation's strongest, received . wide support from California prosecutors and law enforcement . agencies that hoped it could help reduce smartphone thefts. According to the National Consumers League, handheld devices . were stolen from 1.6 million Americans in 2012. In California, . smartphone theft accounts for more than half of all crimes in . San Francisco, Oakland and other cities. Other states experiencing a rash of smartphone thefts have . considered similar measures, and Minnesota passed a . theft-prevention law last year. So far, Apple, Samsung and Google have implemented kill . switches on their smartphones, and Microsoft is expected to . release an operating system for its Windows phones that has one . this year, the three officials said in their news release. 'Kill Switch': As part of an update to the operating system and the 'Find My Phone' application, iPhone users will be able to deactivate their devices online . But some of the smartphone systems require consumers to opt . in, meaning not all will be protected when their phones are . operating in the default mode. Gascon, Johnson and Schneiderman called on all manufacturers . to make the technology active as a default position, as Apple . has done with its iPhones.

"A Queensland teenager who stands accused of stabbing a classmate said that he was attempting to scare him into ending his bullying behaviour. The 16-year-old said he wanted to 'jab' the other boy, and has pleaded guilty to unlawfully wounding, but maintains he is not guilty to the charge of attempted murder or wounding in an attempt to maim or disfigure. The boy, who cannot be named, was 14 when he stabbed his fellow year ten student with a kitchen knife at a Brisbane school in August 2013. A Queensland teenager who stands accused of stabbing a classmate said that he was attempting to scare him into ending his bullying behaviour . The teenager said that he had been inspired by computer games when he devised a plan to scare the other student, who was not seriously injured in the attack. The 16-year-old alleged that the boy had repeatedly bullied him, and he decided to bring the knife to school hidden in his blazer, and brandish it at the classmate. During the course of the day, the boy pushed the 16-year-old's head, causing him to change his mind. 'I started thinking, maybe if I jab him with it then he'll get really afraid and definitely not do that stuff any more,' the teenager told the Brisbane Supreme Court. The boy, who cannot be named, brought his classmate to the school auditorium where he stabbed him in side of the neck. 'The original plan was to quickly just nick him with it and ... say to him, like, ""This is what's going to happen to you except worse if you keep on bullying people"", the boy said in the witness stand. The teenager faced Brisbane Supreme Court on Wednesday accused of attempted murder . The boy brought his classmate to the school auditorium where he stabbed him in side of the neck. Despite 'freaking out', the 16-year-old said that he thought 'I have to go through with this. He's not going to change ... and so I went through with it.' The accused said he panicked and raced off when the victim made a gargling sound, thinking he had caused serious injury. He dialled triple-zero and said, 'I think I just killed someone.' The court has previously heard the wound was more than 5cm deep, and that the teenager decided to stab his classmate in the neck because it had fat and 'nothing important'. The accused agreed he had earlier told a friend he was going to kill the victim, but said had not meant it and was just 'venting anger'. The judge-only trial continues.

"Former Cleveland police chief Sean Price was being sued to £500,000 the force claimed he was wrongly paid - he will now repay just £23,000 . A police force which was suing its former chief constable for £500,000 has settled out of court for less than 5% of the figure, it has emerged. Cleveland Police were trying to claw back salary and bonuses it believed Sean Price was wrongly paid across a number of years before he was sacked for gross misconduct in 2012. The civil case was due to be heard next month but Police and Crime Commissioner (PCC) Barry Coppinger has now said Mr Price's offer of £23,000 has been accepted. The force has already spent about £30,000 on external barristers' fees - £7,000 more than what Mr Price will pay. Mr Price was the first chief constable in 35 years to be sacked after an inquiry found he lied about his role in the recruitment of the former police authority chairman's daughter. The settlement in the case was due to mounting legal costs during a time of budget pressures and Mr Price's ability to pay any more, Mr Coppinger said. In a document on the PCC's website, he wrote that the case against Mr Price was based on the legal argument that the payments were originally made 'by mistake of law'. He accepted the £23,000 offer was a 'modest proportion' of what had been hoped for, but said it was made in good faith, with reference to Mr Price's ability to pay. Mr Price, a father of two, has allowed the force to see financial documents, the PCC said. Mr Coppinger said: 'I concluded that I faced a choice either to accept the sum which Mr Price had demonstrated he could afford or proceed to court, risking an estimated overall six-figure sum in court costs which was unlikely to be realistically recoverable.' He added that other PCCs and forces had considered similar civil claims before deciding not to proceed. Mr Coppinger said the payments Mr Price received were investigated under the wide-ranging Operation Sacristy inquiry into alleged corruption, but did not result in criminal charges. He said: 'Although ending the claim will mean that the court will not have the opportunity to address the legal questions, taking all of the considerations in the round I have determined that it would be appropriate to conclude the matter on the basis of the payment of the sum offered.' Mr Price became the first chief constable in 35 years to be sacked after an inquiry found he lied about his role in the recruitment of the former police authority chairman's daughter . Mr Price said in a statement: 'This was a difficult decision for me as I had a strong case that the payments were lawful and should not be repaid 10 years later. 'However, the case has cost me several thousand pounds already and the public a great deal more. The only people benefiting have been lawyers. 'I made the decision that the best course of action was to settle now to prevent the costs escalating further. 'Notwithstanding our differences, I would like to pass my best to all at Cleveland Police in dealing with the financial challenges facing the force in the future.' A civil court hearing had been told Mr Price received a £50,000 retention package and an £24,000 bonus for cutting crime during his time as chief constable. When he took the top job in 2003, his salary of £125,000 included a £32,000 car allowance, £4,000 a year towards private school fees fir his son and £1,000 towards private health insurance. By the time he was suspended in 2011, his total pay was £200,000. The current Police and Crime Commissioner for Cleveland  said the decision was taken after considering how much Mr Price could afford to pay and the legal costs of contesting the case . Ron Hogg will not face prosecution over bonus payments paid while he was at Cleveland Police . A police and crime commissioner has been told he will not be prosecuted over bonuses and a car he received when he was a senior officer at a neighbouring force. Ron Hogg, Durham police and crime commissioner, was subject of an Independent Police Complaints Commission investigation into his time at Cleveland Police where he was deputy chief constable. Last week the IPCC said it was passing on its findings to the Crown Prosecution Service, which considered whether a charge of misconduct in a public office was appropriate. The CPS has announced there was 'insufficient evidence to show any crime has been committed'. Mr Hogg was deputy chief at Cleveland when he retired in 2008 and had received two bonus payments, the CPS said. There was no evidence he had asked for them, but he was recommended for them by the then chief constable Sean Price who assessed his performance as very good. Mr Hogg, who was elected to the post of PCC in 2012 after a long career in policing, said: 'This matter should never have been referred to the Crown Prosecution Service. 'I am pleased at the announcement but disappointed it should have got this far. I am not surprised that I have been completely exonerated, there was no case to answer. 'The IPCC should not have been spending valuable taxpayers resources on something like this.'","Sean Price was sacked by Cleveland Police in 2012 for gross misconduct .

"Patricia Arquette has spoken out in support of Bruce Jenner following reports that he is transitioning from male to female. The Oscar nominated actress, 46, appeared on The Meredith Vieira Show on Wednesday, where she stood up for the former Olympian, and spoke about her transgender sister Alexis. 'I feel like Alexis, my sister, has taught me so much about love and acceptance,' Patricia said. 'It’s a very difficult thing to be transgender, especially 20 years ago when Alexis started ... You have to be so brave to live this truth of who you are. Scroll down for video . Full support: Patricia Arquette stood up for Bruce Jenner on The Meredith Vieira Show on Wednesday . 'If Ms. Jenner is transitioning, I give all my support to her and love and appreciate everything she has given to America and her bravery, because she is fighting a fight for a lot of kids that are being kicked out of their own homes—society turns their back on these kids. It’s really brutal.' Patricia recalled the conversation she had with her sister Alexis - who is just 15 months younger than her - when she revealed she was transitioning. 'I didn't exactly understand it,' the Boyhood star admitted. 'But our father had died, our mother had died. I’d lost two people I loved. Close bond: The actress spoke about her sister Alexis, who is transgender and has 'taught me so much' Not ready to address the reports: Bruce, pictured in October, has not yet confirmed that he is transitioning from male to female . 'And we all come into this life in a different package – a baby package. We get older, we become an old person package. If you’re male or female, at the end I didn't care. I had people I loved who died. 'I said, ""I don’t care what package you’re comfortable in, I love and accept you. I am glad you are here on earth. I want to be with you, spend time with you."" It doesn't matter.' Patricia went on to slam publications giving Bruce negative press amid reports he has decided to live as a female. 'These newspapers, these magazines, that are being so disrespectful. They should be ashamed,' she said. 'Because they really are on the unforgivable side of history and what they are doing is pathetic and immature and repulsive.' 'I love  and accept you': Patricia recalled what she said to her younger sibling when Alexis told her she was transitioning . Speaking up: The 46-year-old explained that more has to be done to support transgender people who are 'diminished in society' Famous family: Patricia (far right) and Alexis (C) are seen in April 2014 with their fellow actor siblings, (L-R) David, Rosanna and Richmond . Patricia added: 'So many young people commit suicide, don’t have acceptance. They’re diminished in society. They’re not allowed to work counters at stores, people make fun of them, snicker at them, attack them.' Bruce is yet to confirm that he is transitioning from male to female, although it is claimed he will do an exclusive interview with Diane Sawyer, and that he will document the process with a TV series. The Keeping Up With The Kardashians star, 65, was involved in a four-car pile-up on Saturday on Pacific Coast Highway, which left one woman dead. Patricia and Alexis also count actors Rosanna, David and Richmond as their siblings. Alexis' transition was documented in the movie Alexis Arquette: She's My Brother, which premiered in 2007 at the Tribeca Film Festival. Their father Lewis, who died in 2001, was also an actor, while their mother Mardi, who died in 1997, was an actress, poet, therapist and teacher.

"Every parent thinks of their own offspring as a little angel. But for Matt and Stephanie Brown the comparison is closer than most. Their two-year-old son Oliver was born with a rare skin condition that makes him look like he has feathered wings across his upper back. The unusual mark runs half way down his spine from his hairline and across his shoulder blades. But it must be checked by doctors at least every three months, his wings may turn lethal. Scroll down for video . Little angel: Two-year-old Oliver Brown, from Fenstanton in Cambridgeshire, who was born with a large birthmark on his back on the top of his back that looks like a pair of angel's wings . Mixed blessing: The unusual mark runs half way down Oliver's spine from his hairline and across his shoulder blades. But it must be checked by doctors at least every three months, his wings may turn lethal . Baby love: Oliver with his mother, Stephanie. His parents have been told he will live a full and healthy life unless the condition spreads to his brain or spine. He also faces an increased risk of aggressive skin cancer . Oliver was at birth diagnosed with Congenital Melanocytic Naevi (CMN) - oversized moles or birthmarks which affect just one person in every hundred. Despite the diagnosis Oliver is likely to live a full and healthy life, but he must be careful: children with particularly large marks are at increased risk of the most aggressive forms of skin cancer. Because of that, he has to wear a sunsuit and prescription sunscreen to protect him from the sun's UV rays. There is also a risk of the condition spreading to the brain or spine, where the lesions and moles could cripple his nervous system. Mrs Brown, 34, from Fenstanton, Cambridgeshire, told Mason's News Service: '[Oliver] is one of the fortunate ones. Some children are riddled with moles and even get them on their eyelids. 'He actually has his on the top half of his back so it looks like wings. There can be lots of questions because it comes up to the nape of his neck and so is visible. 'As he gets older we would hope he can accept himself for who he is. We have all got these bits of ourselves that we do not like and we have to accept them. 'He is wonderful the way he is and I'm sure in the dark times he will realise this. 'He is lucky in the sense he is such a cutie pop, everyone seems to think so, and I think people will overlook his condition.' New baby: Oliver pictured at birth, when he was first diagnosed with Congenital Melanocytic Naevi (CMN) - oversized moles or birthmarks which affect just one person in every hundred . Marks: The latest research has found the cause of 80 per cent of CMN cases is a mutated gene which develops as the baby is in the womb, said Lucy Hardwidge of the Caring Matters Now help group . Precious: Babies and children with CMN have regular MRI scans to check the spread of the condition . Oliver attends Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge every three months for a check-up. Doctors examine the moles to see if any are turning cancerous and Oliver is given MRI scans to see if he has developed any tumours on his brain or spine. Lucy Hardwidge of the Caring Matters Now help group, said: 'Children with CMN have to be very careful. 'There is an increased risk of cancer so factor 50 sun cream is a must and we now have UV protection clothing which can be used. 'But it's also important to let them have their childhood and the kids still need vitamin D. 'Sometimes the birthmarks can break down and crack so they have to have cream to help them. 'In some cases it turns into CMN syndrome which sees pigmentation on the brain and spine which can cause fits and stop development and can be fatal when tumours develop. 'In children with CMN the cancer is 10 times more aggressive and it's untreatable once it reaches the brain. 'Our latest research has found the cause of 80 per cent of CMN cases and it's caused by a mutated gene which develops as the baby is in the womb. 'This is why it's so important to give babies MRI scans at birth and regularly to keep an eye on it in case it spreads.' Charity work: Oliver with his seven-year-old brother Josh and other pupils at Fen Drayton Primary School, which is helping to raise money for Caring Matters Now by staging a 10km fun run . Ms Hardwidge said likening children's birthmarks to shapes lets them know they are special. 'When children have interesting shaped birthmarks it's a great way of telling them them about the condition and letting them know they are special,' she said. 'Oliver's mum does it by telling him he has angel wings. 'My own daughter has one on her leg shaped like a paw print and that was a great way of telling her about it.' Oliver's seven year-old brother Josh's school, Fen Drayton Primary, is holding a 10k fun run to raise money for Caring Matters. Oliver was diagnosed with Congenital Melanocytic Naevi (CMN) - moles or birthmarks which are present at birth and usually oversized. CMN stands for: . Though CMN means birthmark or mole at birth, around 1 per cent of CMN appear after birth, usually in the first year of life. The condition affects 1 per cent of people and having it means there is a risk that lesions and moles can also grow on the brain. This is called CMN syndrome, which can cause fits and stop development. If tumours develop, it can be fatal. Children with particularly large marks are at increased risk of being diagnosed with malignant melanoma, the most lethal form of skin cancer. As a result, they must wear factor 50 sun cream and wear clothing with UV protection, if possible. 'In children with CMN the cancer is 10 times more aggressive and it's untreatable once it reaches the brain,’ said Lucy Hardwidge of the Caring Matters Now help group. Research has shown the majority of CMN cases are caused by a mutated gene. 'Therefore why it's so important to give babies MRI scans at birth and regularly to keep an eye on it in case it spreads,’ said Ms Hardwidge.

"A glitch on the United Airlines website saw travellers offered return, first class flights from London to Newark for just $74 (£49). The round-trip first class tickets from Heathrow to Newark, just outside of New York City, were snatched up by lucky holidaymakers for just 491 Danish krone due to an apparent error on the site. By registering as a customer in Denmark, holidaymakers could snap up the deal, which would normally set them back $5,618 (£3,690) and $6,778 (£4,452). For a brief period of time on February 11, round-trip, first class fares from London to Newark were available on United.com for just £49 . It is unclear how the deal happened and it appears United has since made changes to prevent anyone else from purchasing the cheap tickets. One customer who snapped up the bargain fare said she simply logged on to United.com and changed her country status to Denmark. She then chose her dates and made sure to select business class or first class from the drop down menu, for example March 19 to March 25. Then, using a credit card without a foreign transaction fee, the purchase was completed and a confirmation email sent, although the customer did say she left her country as 'Denmark' when filling out her postal address. The unbelievable fare totalled 491 Danish krone, which comes to £49 or approximately US$74 . Despite the low costs, two customers reported 'miscellaneous' charges when they came to play, adding up to $326 (£214) to the price of the ticket. It is not known what these costs represent, but both customers said they were happy to pay as the price still worked out much cheaper than a full price first class ticket. MailOnline Travel attempted to secure the same deal at approximately 16:20 GMT, but found that selecting Denmark from the country drop down menu was no longer an option. A second customer secured first class transatlantic flights for a total of 1,356DKK - around $206 or £135 . The country option was then turned back to United Kingdom. It is as yet unclear how many people snapped up the flights during the time of the glitch and whether the airline will honour the bookings. According to a statement provided to MailOnline Travel: 'United has temporarily suspended sales from its Denmark website because a third-party software provider applied an incorrect exchange rate and was misquoting the airline’s properly filed fares. 'This error in the application of the exchange rate primarily impacted individuals who live outside of Denmark and who were not traveling to or from Denmark but were attempting to book tickets using United’s Denmark site.'","Earlier this afternoon, United.com glitch offered hugely discounted fares .

"The child safety watchdog failed to expose the sexual exploitation of thousands of children and young people in Rotherham because its inspectors never bothered to look for it, senior officials admitted yesterday. Inspectors working for the OFSTED regulator were instructed that they should watch out for sex abuse happening inside the children's homes and foster homes where children in council care were living. But their rules said nothing about looking out for the exploitation of children who were collected from houses, institutions and schools by taxi drivers and assaulted and raped away from their homes by determined gangs of abusers. Not one of the officials and inspectors who missed the country's biggest child abuse scandal has been sacked from OFSTED, former executives of the organisation told MPs. Admission: OFSTED's former chiefs said the child safety watchdog failed to expose the sexual exploitation of thousands of children and young people in Rotherham because its inspectors never looked for it . The guidelines that steered OFSTED's inspectors away from the ruthless exploitation of up to 2,000 children and girls by organised Pakistani gangs in the Yorkshire town were revealed to MPs of the Commons Communities and Local Government Committee by two of its former chiefs. Clive Betts, the Labour MP who chairs the committee, said: 'The public thinks OFSTED ticks boxes. It doesn't get in to what is really happening in an authority.' The regulator's former Deputy Chief Inspector John Goldup made the admission and apologised for the watchdog's failures a week after the devastating report on the Rotherham scandal by Government adviser Louise Casey. She found the town's council obscured and suppressed evidence of large-scale sex exploitation, trafficking and rape over a 16-year period, partly because councillors and staff feared being accused of racism. While the gangs were grooming and violently attacking the town's children by the hundred, OFSTED repeatedly rated the councils' social work record as 'adequate' and published a report which said the way it cared for children was improving. Mr Goldup told MPs that the 'framework' within which inspectors examined the council's work was not designed to deal with child sexual exploitation, which he defined as exploitation outside a home. 'The framework focussed on child sex abuse, which mainly happens in children's homes,' he said. 'That framework, I would now look back and and say, was very strongly focussed on effective outcomes on abuse and neglect on children in the home. Why did it not have a focus on child sexual exploitation? I have reflected on that as you can imagine.' The framework was known as Safeguarding Looked After Children, or SLAC for short, Mr Goldup said. One MP commented: 'Slack may be the appropriate word.' Mr Goldup added: 'I think that our understanding of child sexual exploitation - and I'm not just talking about Ofsted but a national understanding - up to that time was that it was an evil that had surfaced in a small number of very specific places and very specific circumstances. Accountable: Not one of the officials and inspectors who missed the country's biggest child abuse scandal has been sacked from OFSTED, former executives of the organisation told MPs . 'We didn't understand the scale and prevalence and scope of child sexual exploitation until 2012. I don't think we understood that it almost certainly affects thousands of children all around the country and it could be happening in any local authority. 'By the end of 2012 we were inspecting for child sexual exploitation in a very different way. We needed to improve. We needed to learn. We didn't get it right at the time we inspected Rotherham.' However Michael Hart, OFSTED director of children in 2007 and 2008, told the MPs that inspectors did know about child sexual exploitation outside the home. 'This wasn't a new concept,' he said. 'Of course it was known about.' He said OFSTED had referred to child sexual exploitation in Rotherham in a report published as early as 2006. Mr Goldup said: 'I don't think inspection is perfect. I don't think inspection can ever be perfect.' He added that he agreed with OFSTED's chief Sir Michael Wilshaw 'that we didn't get it right with child sexual exploitation in Rotherham. He apologised for that and I apologise for that. 'The inspection frameworks at the time didn't have the focus on child sexual exploitation that they would and should have had if we had known and understood then what we know and understand now. 'It is clear from reading back over the inspection reports that we didn't appreciate the scale of the child sexual exploitation issue in Rotherham and we didn't scrutinise sufficiently the effectiveness with which it was being responded to.' Mr Goldup and Mr Hart both told MPs that they had sacked no-one at OFSTED over the failure. They said if inspectors were found to have failed in their job, inspection reports could be rewritten and republished. But the public would not be told about lapses by inspectors.","Former OFSTED executives admitted to failing to expose sexual exploitation .

"Alex Rodriguez is returning to baseball later this month following a year-long suspension for using performance-enhancing drugs - but, first hes' got some apologizing to do. The tainted slugger privately met with Yankees team officials on Tuesday to ask for forgiveness for dragging the team through the mug - both with his use of banned substances and his scorched earth defense as he fought Major League Baseball's suspension. Next stop on his apology tour: a public mea culpa in front of the media, the New York Post reports. Scroll down for video . Coming back: Alex Rodriguez, seen here in his last game on September 25, 2013, is returning to the Yankees after a season-long ban for using performance-enhancing drugs . Rodriguez reportedly announced his intention to make a public apology in the news media before he starts to play again. Team officials reportedly asked Rodriguez to go in front of cameras before February 20 - the first day of spring training. 'Today we held a meeting at Yankee Stadium between (Yankees principal owner) Hal Steinbrenner, (president) Randy Levine, (general manager) Brian Cashman, (assistant general manager) Jean Afterman, Alex Rodriguez and (Rodriguez's attorney) Jim Sharp,' the team said in statement. 'Alex initiated the meeting and apologized to the organization for his actions over the past several years.' He previously met with new MLB Commissioner Rob Manfred to offer an apology to officials there, as well. Rodriguez was suspended for 162 games - the entire 2014 season - after Major League Baseball found his name on the client list for Biogenesis - a South Florida anti-aging clinic that was peddling PEDs to professional athletes. A-Rod met with co-owner Hal Steinbrenner (left), team president Randy Levine (center) and general manager Brian Cashman (right) in the Bronx this week . He was initially given a 211-game suspension by MLB Commissioner Bud Selig, though an arbitrator reduced the sentence. Rodriguez's last game was September 25, 2013 at Yankee Stadium. However, as he appealed the suspension, he waged a brutal legal campaign against major league baseball, but also the Yankees - claiming the team had tried to sabotage his health to get out of paying his lucrative contract. He also emphatically denied that he ever used performance enhancing drugs. Now, though, 39-year-old Rodriguez is back. He still has three more seasons left on his contract and about $61million the Yankees owe him, so the team and the former All-Star need to make amends. Also at issue is the $6million bonus that Rodriguez is owed if he hit six more home runs to tie Willie Mays at No. 4 on the all-time home run list. The Post reports that the Yankees are fighting that clause of Rodriguez's contract on the grounds that his PED suspension means the team cannot market the milestone as had been agreed.","Alex Rodriguez returns to baseball this season after serving a 162-game suspension for using banned substances .

"House Speaker John Boehner lashed out at Democrats in the U.S. Senate on Wednesday, shouting that they should 'get off their a**' and fund the Department of Homeland Security. He blasted liberals in the upper house of Congress for blocking a series of votes because of provisions that would kill President Obama's sweeping immigration policy overhaul. Boehner even mocked them by bringing up a pamphlet sold in the congressional gift shop describing how a bill becomes a law. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . UP IN THEIR FACE: Republican Speaker of the House from Ohio John Boehner told reporters on Wednesday that Senate Democrats need to 'get off their a**' and support a GOP-backed Homeland Security funding bill . DOWN, NOT OUT: Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid (center) is holding his caucus together in a bid to block a DHS funding pacjage that would prohibit the White House from mainstreaming millions of illegal immigrants . The House of Representatives has passed a funding bill that kills the White House's plan to mainstream 5 million or more illegal immigrants through granting residency cards and work permits. The president announced in November that he planned to guarantee those who came to the country illegally . 'The House did its job. We won the fight to fund the Department of Homeland Security and to stop the president's unconstitutional actions,' Boehner told reporters during a weekly press briefing. 'Now it's time for the Senate to do their work. You know, in the gift shop out here they've got these little booklets on how a bill becomes a law. Right?' 'The House has done its job. Now why don't you go ask the Senate Democrats when they're going to get off their ass and do something – other than to vote ""no""?' 'The issue here is not Senate Republicans,' he said. 'The issue here is Senate Democrats.' It's not clear how the impasse will be resolved since Republicans in both chambers insist they have no plans for further action. The likeliest outcome may be another short-term extension of current funding levels for the Department of Homeland Security, something agency leaders say would jeopardize their ability to make needed changes at the Secret Service, Border Patrol and other agencies. The issue has emerged with Republicans in their second month of full congressional control after four years of holding the majority in the House but not the Senate. House Republicans have been frustrated to discover that because of Senate rules giving significant rights to the minority party, little has changed and they still can't get their bills through the Senate. Boehner's comments seemed highly unlikely to change Senate Democrats' behavior. On Tuesday, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell declared the Senate 'stuck' on the issue and said the next move was in the House's court. Boehner rejected that, insisting Senate Democrats, led by Minority Leader Harry Reid of Nevada, are at fault. The White House on Wednesday called Republicans' behavior 'irresponsible' and accused them of playing politics with national security. 'I do think that it raises questions about whether or not Republicans are prepared to assume the responsibility the American people have given then to run the United State Congress,' the president's spokesman told reporters. Pointing out that the Constitution gives Congress the power of the purse, White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said, 'This is a matter that the president cant solve for them.' 'They are the ones that have to make the funding decisions,' he said. 'And I don't think there's anybody who thinks its a good idea, Democrat or Republican, for us to not fund the Department of Homeland Security, particularly at this time when our homeland faces some pretty serious threats.' 'So it is time for Republicans to set aside politics, to focus on their core responsibility to fund the Department of Homeland Security,' Earnest said. If they do that, he said, they will find a Democratic president who will work with them to 'ensure that our Department of Homeland Security has the resources necessary to protect the American people.' Boehner's comments Wednesday underscored a worsening stalemate on Capitol Hill with funding for the Homeland Security Department set to expire Feb. 27 .","House Republicans have passed a Homeland Security funding bill that guts Obama's ability to mainstream millions of illegal immigrants .

Hollywood agent Jessica Marie Steindorff, 29, had last lost her license in 2013 for failure to appear and had not yet won it back when she was rear-ended by 69-year-old Kim Howe. Howe was previously revealed to have been herself driving without a license when she crashed into Steindorff and was in turn rear-ended by Bruce Jenner before a Hummer smashed into her car, leading to the millionaire widow's death. Driving on a suspended license: Hollywood agent Jessica Marie Steindorff, whose clients include Alessandra Ambrosio, was the driver in the head car in the deadly Saturday pileup involving Bruce Jenner . Neither should have been driving: Steindorff was hit from behind by the crash's sole fatality Kim Howe--who was, herself, driving with an expired license . According to the New York Daily News, Steindorff--whose clients include Victoria's Secret model Alessandra Ambrosio--also had her licensed suspended in 2012 for an 'unsatisfied judgment.' Steindorff, who has reportedly been cooperative with investigators, told police she'd stopped at behind a line of cars that were sitting at a red when she was rear-ended. While this cannot be confirmed, police say her story meshes with the traffic tendencies at the Malibu light. 'There were many theories, including the possibility she may have been trying to make a U-turn to get a parking spot, but we have no independent witnesses who've come forward with that information,' law enforcement close to the case told the Daily News. However, Steindorff's attorney came to her defense late Tuesday, telling the Daily News: . The black 2010 Prius that led the 4-car pileup in Malibu on Saturday involving Bruce Jenner that left Kim Howe, 69, dead . Horrific: A sombre-looking Bruce Jenner surveys the crash scene on Saturday, including the mangled Lexus sedan that Kim Howe was driving when she was killed . Smash: Howe was driving this white Lexus sedan, right, when it was pushed into oncoming traffic, causing the fatal collision . 'The story that she was making an illegal u-turn is 100 percent false. She was meeting with a client in Zuma. She has the text messages that prove it,' said attorney Roger Simon, referring to the area west of Malibu. 'She met with detectives today. Nothing looks to be criminal,' Simon said. 'She was a victim.' Detectives in Malibu continue to work on an investigation into the fatal wreck, with which Jenner is said to be cooperating completely. The former Olympian took the $14,000 compact car out for a spin today after a weekend under the public glare for his driving as police investigate whether the reality star was texting while driving at the time of the deadly crash . Trading down: Bruce Jenner swapped his $76,000 Cadillac Escalade and his $185,000 Porche for a $14,000 compact Ford Fiesta on Monday . Coffee run: It appears that Jenner is trying to keep a lower profile following the crash in Saturday, which left a 69-year-old woman dead and made headlines the world over . He took, and passed, a sobriety test immediately after the crash, and also gave officers a blood sample at a nearby hospital. Victim: Kim Howe, 69, died in the crash in Malibu, California on Saturday . Since the crash, Jenner has been seen on the roads again. Monday morning he made a Starbucks run in an inconspicuous Ford Fiesta. The former Olympian took the $14,000 compact car out for a spin today after a weekend under the public glare for his driving. Detectives in Malibu have opened a vehicular homicide investigation in the crash Saturday afternoon on the Pacific Coast Highway, CNN reports. If any of the drivers in the crash if found criminally negligent, felony charges could be filed - which carry a sentence of up to six years in prison. On Monday, detectives said they are planning to ask Jenner to turn over his cell phone records to show whether he was texting while driving at the time of the crash - an activity that could net a vehicular manslaughter charge under California law, the Los Angeles Times reports. The Keeping Up With the Kardashians reality star has vehemently denied he was texting and driving and said he would gladly offer up his cell phone records to move it. At the time he was driving a $76,000 Escalade ESV, which was hauling a dune buggy. Jenner, who is in the midst of transitioning from a man to a woman, told police that he was taking a 'very low dosage of hormones that his doctor had prescribed,' a family source told Radar Online. The very next day, he was spotted out in his Porsche 911 GT3 RS - a 500hp supercar that costs about $185,000. Pictures from the outing published by the New York Post show Jenner speeding. He was driving at least 56mph in a 50mph zone, according to a digital speed limit sign on the road. It is unknown why Jenner opted to dramatically downgrade his set of wheels.","Jessica Stendorff, 29, who counts Victoria's Secret model Alessandra Ambrosio among her clients, was driving on a suspended license .

"The man who invented the lithium battery - which now powers almost every portable device on the planet - claims he may have another world-changing invention up his sleeve. Professor John Goodenough first demonstrated that lithium cobalt oxide could be used to create a rechargable battery capable of storing energy in 1979 at Oxford University. Now, aged 92 and at the University of Texas at Austin, he is working on a new type of 'super battery' that could change the way we use electricity. Professor John Goodenough (pictured above left) has received honors including the National Medal of Technology and Innovation from Barack Obama, for his role in the invention of the lithium ion battery . He claims the development would solve the problem of storing excess electricity produced by wind turbines in heavy winds and also mean solar power could be stored. It may also allow electric cars to have ranges that can surpass those powered by traditional fossil fuels. An Israeli company says it has developed technology that can charge a mobile phone in a few seconds and an electric car in minutes. Using nano-technology to synthesize artificial molecules, Tel Aviv-based StoreDot says it has developed a battery that can store a much higher charge more quickly, in effect acting like a super-dense sponge to soak up power and retain it. The company earlier this year unveiled a slim line version of its battery that can absorb and deliver a half a day's power for a smartphone in just 60 seconds. They hope to improve this so the FlashBattery can hold a full days charge in just 30 seconds. The innovation is based around the creation of 'nanodots', which StoreDot describes as bio-organic peptide molecules. Nanodots alter the way a battery behaves to allow the rapid absorption and, critically, the retention of power. The ever-growing power demands of smartphones could also be met, meaning they could last for days on a single charge rather than a few hours. Speaking in an interview with Quartz, Professor Goodenough said: 'I want to solve the problem before I throw my chips in. 'I'm only 92. I still have time to go.' Professor Goodenough, and his team of engineers, is attempting to crack one of the toughest problems in battery science. Currently, lithium ion batteries use a metal compound as the positive electrode from which ions flow to a negative electrode made from carbon. Professor Goodenough instead wants to use pure lithium or sodium metal as the negative electrode. This would, in theory, allow batteries to store 60 per cent more energy than current lithium ion batteries. That would also mean electric cars - which currently have a maximum range of up to 265 miles on a single charge - could make much longer journeys before needing to be recharged. It could also allow new ways to economically store power produced by renewable energy. Currently, sources such as wind turbines must be 'switched off' during periods of low demand as the energy they produce cannot be stored. Electric cars like the G Wiz above have a limited range compared to other cars due to the batteries they carry . However, using lithium or sodium metal in batteries has proven difficult in the past - these metals are incredibly unstable and catch fire explosively when exposed to water. Professor Goodenough claims he is on the path towards solving this problem. Most attempts to improve the performance of batteries have been incremental by tweaking their design to improve charging time and storage. Mobile phones could last for days and even weeks with new battery technology that can hold more power . Electric car pioneers such as Tesla have managed to make improvements and can now achieve a range of around 312 miles from its largest batteries. But these are not cheap- costing around $100,000. Other electric cars, like Nissan's Leaf, are more affordable but only have ranges of around 120 miles. Professor Goodenough said that while tinkering with the design of current batteries will bring about some improvements, he believes using all metal electrodes could transform the technology. He said: 'You need something that will give you a little bit of a step, not an increment.' Professor Goodenough was part of the team that first proved that rechargeable batteries could be created using lithium cobalt oxide and lithium metal as the two electrodes. The lithium ion battery has allowed electronic devices to become progressively smaller and more portable . In 1991 Sony combined the lithium cobalt oxide cathode with a carbon anode to produce the first commercial rechargable battery. The technology has since allowed laptop computers and mobile phones to become smaller and more powerful. Professor Goodenough's breakthrough has won him many acolades and regular nominations for a Nobel Prize. Professor Goodenough wants to create batteries that contain pure metal anodes made from lithium (above) He claims scientists like himself have three decades to crack the problem of new super batteries if they want to avoid the impending shortages with fossil fuel energy resources. He said: 'We’re going to have wars on wars fighting over the last reserves of this, that or the other and we’re going to have global warming beyond anything we can bear. 'There are a lot of people working, and none of them is stupid. I don’t say I’m the only one who can solve the problem.'","Professor John Goodenough is attempting to create a new type of battery .

"For thrifty suitors who believe it is the thought – not the expense – that matters, it could be a godsend. With Valentine's Day looming, a supermarket price war has broken out over the traditional favourite statement of love: a dozen red roses. Instead of the £70 that it could easily cost for a hand-tied bouquet of top-quality long-stemmed Grand Prix red roses, a chap can nip to Lidl and snap up a bunch for just £3. That offer even undercuts its rival Aldi, which is charging £5 for its cheapest bunch. Major supermarkets are preparing for Valentine's day by offering roses for as little as £3 . Lidl is offering a bunch of dozen red roses for £3, left, while budget German rival Aldi has a £5 bunch, right . Tesco, Asda and Morrisons have also slashed the price of their cheapest red roses to £5 for 12, while Sainsbury's has a dozen Fairtrade red roses for £7. Lidl's £3 bouquet consists of 12 Sweetheart red roses, which have smaller blooms. Aldi is also offering a dozen 'Luxury Freedom Roses' for £15 and a dozen 'Premium Naomi Roses' for £20. Tesco is selling its premium bunch at £10, a luxury bouquet at £15 and its Finest red roses at £30. Prices at Marks & Spencer range from £12 for a dozen red Kenyan roses to £40 for its 'Freedom' variety. Of course, that works for lovers who can deliver their flowers to the lady of their desire in person. Those having blooms delivered via Interflora could pay anything from £44.99 to £139.99. Bargain: Lidl is offering roses for £3 . Most of the red roses sold around Valentine's Day are imported from Africa. There are many varieties, from cheaper blooms with small tight heads to Red Desire, which have long stems and luxuriant deep red blooms. A Lidl spokesman said: 'The Sweetheart roses come from both Uganda and Zimbabwe. The head is about 2cm and they would be classed as short stem at around 35-40cm. 'We're able to offer an unbeatable price because we have a long-standing relationship with the supplier and are buying in generous volumes.' But the price war is bad news for the nation's independent florists, who cannot possibly compete. A spokesman for the British Florist Association said: 'Independent florists are finding it harder and harder to survive.' They warned that 8,000 florists shops could disappear in the face of competition from supermarkets. For men agonising over whether to go for the cut-price or the extravagant, a survey commissioned by Morrisons has troubling news. While 85 per cent of bunches bought on Valentine's Day are red roses, 46 per cent of women say they are a lazy choice... and would rather receive a more imaginative variety of flower. Tesco are also offering 12 roses for £5, along with Morrisons and Asda. Sainsbury's cheapest bunch is £7 . At the more luxury end of the market, Marks & Spencer offer between £12 for a dozen red Kenyan roses to £40 for its 'Freedom' variety .","Lidl is offering 12 'Sweetheart' red roses with smaller blooms for just £3 .

"A thief was caught on CCTV as he stole a charity collection tin full of cash while collecting a parcel from his local food bank. David Hindmarch was filmed as he took the money from a community cafe in Hartlepool, County Durham, where he was picking up a free box of food donated by volunteers. The 36-year-old was arrested after charity workers spotted him on security footage sliding the tin into his coat. He was given a suspended jail sentence last week after he pleaded guilty to the theft. Scroll down for video . Caught: David Hindmarch was caught on CCTV as he took the collection tin (circled) from the counter of the Hartlepool community cafe. He was caught after charity workers spotted him on the security footage . Target: Cafe One77, where the money was stolen. He took around £70 that was being collected for Hartlepool Families First, a charity that supports vulnerable families and young people, according to charity bosses . The CCTV footage shows Hindmarch, from Hartlepool, dressed in a hooded jumper and hat, approaching the counter and looking around the cafe before sliding the tin inside his coat. He took around £70 that was being collected for Hartlepool Families First, a charity that supports vulnerable families and young people, according to charity bosses. Volunteers from the organisation spotted the tin was missing and spotted Hindmarch stealing the collection tin after looking at the security footage. Officers tracked him down and he was given an eight-week jail term, suspended for 12 months, at Hartlepool Magistrates' Court last Wednesday. Speaking after the court case, family charity manager Paul Thompson slammed the thief and said his actions were 'a real kick in the teeth'. He said: 'There was a strong sense of anger within the team. We rely on donations from members of the public and for someone to take some of those donations is just awful. Shifty: Dressed in a hooded jumper and hat, Hindmarch approaches the counter in the community cafe . Swiped: The 36-year-old looks around the cafe after sliding the charity collection tin inside his jacket . 'This particular can had mainly been filled by elderly people who come in for a free lunch group that we've been running. 'They struggle financially but always want to make a contribution and to say thank you. 'It's just a real kick in the teeth and the lowest form of theft.' Staff said Hindmarch went into Cafe One77 in Hartlepool to collect a parcel from charity group Paradox, who were handing out food on January 31. The cafe is also used by Hartlepool Families First, which helps residents living in disadvantaged areas - including children and young people with disabilities. Nervous: He appears to knock over a cup on his way out. Hindmarch was collecting a food parcel at the time . Getaway: The thief, who was handed a suspended sentence for the crime, is seen leaving the scene . CCTV shows Hindmarsh check nobody was looking before pocketing donations made to the charity by users. Mr Thompson added: 'We looked back through the CCTV and caught this nice fellow helping himself to the charity collection tin. 'We're going to have to anchor the tin to the counter now, so it will have to be unlocked before it can be removed. 'It's sad when you have to do that because chains kind of send out a bad feeling - but that's what we're going to have to do now.' Hindmarch pleaded guilty to the theft, was given an eight-week jail term suspended for 12 months, ordered to pay £50 compensation, £85 court costs and an £80 victim surcharge.","David Hindmarch stole £70 donated to charity helping vulnerable families .

"A rare gray wolf killed by a hunter in Utah last December was the same one spotted near the Grand Canyon months earlier, DNA testing has confirmed. The three-year-old female - named Echo in a nationwide student contest - was the first of her species to be seen in the area since at least 1945. She had wandered more than 500 miles in her lifetime in a bid to find a mate and was seen roaming near the Grand Canyon's North Rim and nearby forest in October and November. The hunter responsible for Echo's death, who has not been named, said he mistook the wolf for a coyote. Sad story: A rare gray wolf killed by a hunter in Utah last December was the same one spotted near the Grand Canyon months earlier, DNA testing has confirmed -  she was named Echo (pictured above) He gunned her down near Beaver, Utah, roughly 150 miles north of where she had last been seen in Arizona . According to the Utah Division of Wildlife Resources, the hunter immediately contacted officials when he realized his mistake. Wolves in Utah are protected under the U.S. Endangered Species Act, which bans killing of imperiled animals without a special permit, but coyotes in the state are allowed to be shot on sight. Wolves and coyotes often have similar coloring, but wolves are usually twice as large as coyotes, said Kim Hersey, mammal conservation coordinator with Utah Division of Wildlife Resources. Wolves also have longer legs, bigger feet and rounder ears and snouts, she said. Geneticists at the University of Idaho did  tests comparing DNA taken from the shot wolf with scat samples taken from the animal seen near the Grand Canyon last fall. The results were apparently conclusive that it was the same wolf. Wandering lone wolf: The three-year-old female's epic journey from the Rockies to the Grand Canyon sadly came to an end last December when she was shot dead by a hunter in Utah . Analysis of the animal's scat while it was in Arizona in October showed it had traveled hundreds of miles from the Northern Rockies in Wyoming . Echo was the first gray wolf seen in the Grand Canyon since the 1940s, when the last wolf there was killed as part of an extensive eradication campaign. She had worn a radio collar since January 2014, allowing experts to track her movements. Wildlife advocates said the death was shameful, whether or not the wolf was Echo. 'It's very sad either way,' said Michael Robinson, conservation advocate with the Center for Biological Diversity. The organisation has documented 11 cases since 1981 where hunters told wildlife officials they had shot a wolf thinking it was a coyote. The investigation regarding Echo's death remains ongoing and could take weeks or months to complete. It's not clear yet what penalties the hunter could face for killing the animal.","The three-year-old female - named Echo in a nationwide student contest - was the first of her species to be seen in the area since at least 1945 .

"The wife of a man who allegedly killed three Muslim students execution-style has insisted that it was not due to their religion - but his victims' families have called on the police to investigate it as a hate crime. Karen Hicks struggled to contain her emotions as she spoke at a press conference a day after Craig Hicks, 46, allegedly shot dead the trio near the University of North Carolina campus in Chapel Hill. After the deaths of Deah Shaddy Barakat, 23, his wife Yusor Mohammad, 21, and her sister Razan Mohammad Abu-Salha, 19, it emerged that Hicks had shared numerous anti-religious posts online - but his wife insisted that he did not target the family because of their beliefs. 'I can say with my absolute belief that this incident had nothing to do with religion or these victims' faith,' his wife insisted on Wednesday afternoon. 'But in fact was related to long-standing parking disputes that my husband had with the neighbors.' Scroll down for video . Defense: Karen Hicks, who is married to suspected killer Craig Hicks, insisted on Wednesday that he was not motivated by race or religion when he allegedly shot three Muslims on Tuesday afternoon . Sadness: The family of victim Deah Shaddy Barakat spoke at a press conference at Swift Creek Community Center on Wednesday afternoon to call for police to investigate the killings as a hate crime . Mourning: The victim's mother, Leila Barakat, closes her eyes as her daughter speaks on Wednesday . She added that 'like everyone else, I was just completely shocked that this had happened', especially because her husband of seven years often 'championed' rights of others. 'He just believed... everyone is equal,' she said. 'It doesn't matter what you look like or who you are, that's one thing I do know about him.' Mrs Hicks' attorney said that the case highlights the need for mental health support - but refused to say whether Craig Hicks had any mental illness. But in their own press conference held later on Wednesday, the family of Barakat called on the police to investigate the death as a hate crime. His sister Suzanna Barakat said she cried tears of joy at her brother's wedding - little more than a month ago - but today she is crying 'tears of unimaginable pain'. The three victims were gunned down at their quiet condominium complex in Chapel Hill around 5pm. Hicks turned himself in to authorities and is being held without bond. On Wednesday morning, he kept his head down as he appeared in an orange jumpsuit at the Durham County Detention Center. On Wednesday, Durham District Attorney Roger Echols said: 'All motives will be under investigation.' In court: Craig Hicks, 46, is pictured as he enters the courtroom for his first appearance at the Durham County Detention Center on Wednesday, a day after he allegedly shot the three young students to death . Gunned down: (From left) Deah Shaddy Barakat, 23, his wife Yusor Mohammad, 21, and her sister Razan Mohammad Abu-Salha, 19, were all shot dead near the University of North Carolina on Tuesday . Loved: Flowers are placed outside UNC's School of Dentistry in recognition of the victims on Wednesday . Moved: Schoolmates mourn at a makeshift memorial for the three students who were killed on Tuesday . There have been questions over whether his anti-religious stance - which he freely shared on social media - had been a factor in the murders. Before Mrs Hicks spoke, the father of the two female victims, Dr. Mohammad Abu-Salha, said he believed the trio were targeted because of their religion and culture. 'It was execution style, a bullet in every head,' Abu-Salha told the News Observer. 'This was not a dispute over a parking space, this was a hate crime. 'This man had picked on my daughter and her husband a couple of times before, and he talked with them with his gun in his belt. And they were uncomfortable with him, but they did not know he would go this far.' On Facebook, Hicks shared a number of anti-religion posts, describing himself as a supporter of 'Atheists for Equality'. A banner about 'anti-theism' is prominent on his page. Hicks posted a photo from United Atheists of America on February 8, which has the title 'why radical Christians and radical Muslims are so opposed to each others' influence when they agree about so many ideological issues'. Together: Craig and Karen Hicks have been married for seven years and he is a graduate student, she said . Most of the pictures he has posted in recent months criticize a number of religions, including Christianity. Other recent pictures he has published include one of a loaded revolver. In one post allegedly written by Hicks and shared by CNN, he wrote: 'When it comes to insults, your religion started this, not me. If your religion kept its big mouth shut, so would I.' Craig Hicks has been charged with murdering the three Muslim students after handing himself in . He was a full-time student due to graduate in May from paralegal program at Durham Tech, Karen Hicks added. Records show she works for UNC Hospital. Police were called to Summerwalk Circle after shots were heard at about 5.10pm on Tuesday. When they arrived they found three people dead. They had been shot in the head, CNN reported. According to their Facebook pages, Mr Barakat had married his wife just over a month ago and was a second year student at the dental school at the University of North Carolina. The last picture on his Facebook page, posted on January 29, said he helped provide free dental supplies to 75 homeless people in downtown Durham. The couple had organised an online fundraiser to get dental care to refugees from Syria, raising around $15,000 - but after news of their deaths, the total reached more than $23,000 . Mr Barakat was due to travel to Turkey in the summer to treat children who have become refugees following the civil war. Last month, he tweeted: 'It's so freaking sad to hear people saying we should 'kill Jews' or 'Kill Palestinians'. As if that's going to solve anything SMH [shaking my head].' His sister-in-law Razan Mohammad Abu-Salha had been studying for a degree at North Carolina State University in Architecture and Environmental Design. After their deaths, Barakat's brother Farris paid tribute to the trio on Facebook as he struggled to comprehend the killings. The students were shot dead near the quiet area of Finley Forest complex, near Summerwalk Circle . People claiming to be relatives gathered at the scene on Tuesday evening asking who the victims were . Tribute: Flowers have been placed outside the apartment building where the  couple and sister were shot . 'It doesn't make sense,' he wrote, 'and for that I rely on the Most Wise. It hurts and for that I know that God will not burden me more than I can handle. 'I know my brother, his wife, and his sister in law are together as ultimate winners. This life was only ever a test and they have passed with flying colors... 'I haven't even begun to fully comprehend what has happened. But I know for sure those three together have done so much we are all proud of. No reason to stop being proud now.' He added: 'We live as Muslims to die as Muslims. May Allah enter them to the highest of paradise.' Following news of the deaths a hashtag #MuslimLivesMatter started trending on Twitter. Burcu Bozcurt wrote: 'Hate will not prevail. Three beautiful souls taken, but examples of their love & impact on others abounds. #MuslimLivesMatter #chapelhill' And MohaNNad said: 'Remember them like this. Deah and Yusor had names, dreams and families. #MuslimLivesMatter.' The couple are only thought to have been married for just a month and were fundraising for Syrian refugees . Heartbreaking: Yusor shared this beautiful photo, left, showing her dancing with her father at their wedding, right. On Wednesday, he said that he believes the trio were shot due to their religion and culture . Well-known atheist Richard Dawkins also condemned the killings on Twitter. He said: 'How could any decent person NOT condemn the vile murder of three young US Muslims in Chapel Hill?' People called for action to be taken with some speculating that the attack could have been religiously motivated. A Facebook tribute page has been set up for the victims, called 'Our Three Winners'. It says: 'Deah Barakat, Yusor Abu-Salha and Razan Abu-Salha have returned to their Lord. They have set an example in life and in death.' It noted that funeral arrangements will be announced after they receive news from the medical examiner, who will carry out an investigation and release the bodies. The shooting took place in the Finley Forest complex - a typically quiet area home to students. Bethany Boring encountered police cars, crime scene tape and people upset in the street when she went to walk her dog. She told WRAL: 'It's a very quiet community. It's a lot of graduate and professional students. You know, professional's families.' Armed: Two weeks ago he shared this image of his 'loaded 38 revolver, its holster and five extra rounds' People living near Summerwalk Circle said the area was usually very quiet with little or no crime reported . Daniel Waggoner who lives in the area added: 'I'm up late. I come home late and it's always quiet when I get here,' he said. 'So I mean yeah, it's surprising.' A campus crime alert from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill was sent to students. The complex is located near campus. About two hours after the shooting a group of young people arrived at the scene and sat on the pavement, apparently waiting for news of the names of the people who had been killed. Police later turned away people in tears, claiming to be relatives. The Chapel Hill Police Department said in a statement there was 'reason to believe that there is no ongoing threat to the public'. The school added in a statement: 'We are sensitive to the impact an incident of this nature has on campus and in the community. 'We understand you want to know the facts as quickly as possible. At the same time, we must respect the job our Chapel Hill police have as they investigate this crime.'","Karen Hicks gave a teary press conference on Wednesday - a day after her husband 'shot three students over a parking dispute' in Chapel Hill .

"David Cameron was accused of being 'up to his neck' in the Swiss bank account row today, after revelations that a string of Tory donors hoarded money in the country. Former Conservative Party Treasurer Stanley Fink and  German-born car manufacturing heir Georg von Opel, who has donated six-figure sums to the Tories, are among a host of individuals who legally held accounts in Switzerland with HSBC's private bank, according to a leaked tax disc. In a fiery Commons debate, the Prime Minister insisted 'no-one had done more' than the current government to crack down on tax avoidance. Scroll down for video . David Cameron insisted 'no-one had done more' than the current government to crack down on tax avoidance . But Mr Miliband said the PM was 'bang to rights', adding: 'He can't get away from it – he's a dodgy Prime Minister, surrounded by dodgy donors.' It came before tax officials at HMRC were hauled before a Commons committee this afternoon over its 'pathetic' failure to tackle tax avoidance. Chief executive Lin Homer was accused of letting people 'get away with it', by Public Accounts Committee chair Margaret Hodge. Mrs Hodge said: 'You are not serving the British taxpayer.' But Mrs Homer responded: 'That is absolutely not the case.' HMRC bosses knew about the HSBC tax scandal eight months before the bank's chairman was appointed as a Government minister. The agency received a copy of the list of clients with millions stashed away in Switzerland before Lord Green of Hurstpierpoint was brought in to government in January 2011. Labour said it 'beggared belief' that HMRC would not have reported to the Chancellor about problems at the bank when it began investigating the individuals concerned for tax evasion. Ed Miliband accused the Prime Minister of being 'up to his neck' in the Swiss bank account row . Today's debate, during Prime Minister's Questions, became so heated the Commons Speaker John Bercow was forced to intervene . Peers named in the HSBC files include Lord Sterling of Plaistow, the P&O shipping and ports entrepreneur who was ennobled by Margaret Thatcher, and Lord Fink, who was a party treasurer under David Cameron and has given £3m to the Conservatives. MP for Richmond Park, Zac Goldsmith, alongside his financier brother Ben Goldsmith, also held accounts with HSBC's private Swiss bank, according to the Guardian. But Mr Goldsmith issued a statement saying: 'I have never had a Swiss bank account, and do not control any Swiss bank accounts. 'I have never sought or been given tax minimisation advice by HSBC, directly or indirectly. The media commentary around this is therefore wrong.' The Conservatives have raised over £5m from HSBC clients recorded with Swiss accounts, while Labour has also benefited from cash and gifts in kind worth over £500,000, as well as a loan for £2m. Labour donors who held Swiss accounts with HSBC include the steel magnate Swraj Paul and restaurant owner and clothing entrepreneur Richard Caring, who at various times is recorded to have donated to both Labour and the Conservatives. HMRC was asked to vet Lord Green before his appointment, but only about his personal tax arrangements. That was despite a formal investigation by HMRC into the HSBC accounts from at least as early as October 2011. But Downing Street insisted ministers knew nothing about the client list when Mr Cameron made Stephen Green a Tory peer and then trade minister. The revelation that thousands of 'black' accounts were used to stash millions and avoid tax has caused outrage. Bank records were stolen by a whistleblower in 2007, but did not reach Britain until 2010 after a deal between HMRC and the French authorities. Officials say part of the deal was that the taxman could not pass on the details – but they have since been leaked. Since then only one person has been prosecuted despite £135million being recovered. Speaking in Prime Minister's Questions today, Mr Miliband accused the Prime Minister of being too close to wealthy donors with overseas accounts. He said: 'Let's take Stanley Fink, who gave £3million to the Conservative Party. He actually appointed him as Treasurer of the Tory Party and gave him a peerage for good measure. 'Can he explain what steps he's going to take about the tax avoidance activities of Lord Fink.' Mr Cameron said: 'When people donate to the Conservative Party they don't pick the candidates, they don't choose the policies and they don't elect the leader. 'When the trade unions donate they pay for the candidates, they pay for the policies and the only reason he is sitting there is because a bunch of trade union leaders decided he was more left-wing than his brother.' Questions: Lord Green (left) was a Tory trade minister and Dave Hartnett (right) was then HMRC's head of tax . But Mr Miliband said: 'He didn't just take the money. He appointed the man who was head of HSBC as a minister. It was in the public domain September 2010 that HSBC was enabling tax avoidance on an industrial scale – are we seriously expected to believe that when he made Stephen Green a minister four months later he had no idea about these revelations.' He dismissed the claims as 'fiction' and said he had clamped down on tax avoidance. He said: 'Those two in the Treasury were the friends of the tax dodger. We're the friends of the hard-working taxpayer.' Mr Miliband responded: 'He's bang to rights, just like his donors.' The billionaire paedophile friend of Prince Andrew was among HSBC offshore investors named in the leaked account files. The data links Jeffrey Epstein to several private accounts in Geneva, including one in his own name which held £2.3million. Epstein, above right, who was jailed for 13 months in 2008 for soliciting sex with underage girls, was last month accused of employing teenage 'sex slave' Virginia Roberts, who claimed he made her sleep with Prince Andrew when she was 17. Buckingham Palace has denied the Duke of York had 'any form of sexual contact or relationship with Virginia Roberts' and Epstein has called her claims 'outlandish and offensive'. The disgraced hedge fund manager is one of seven clients of HSBC's private banking arm in Geneva known to have donated to the charitable foundation run by former US president Bill Clinton and his wife Hillary. Miss Roberts, now 31 and a mother of three, has said she met Mr Clinton twice but was never 'lent out' to him. She claimed Epstein told her: 'He owes me some favours.' Epstein gave $25,000 (£16,400) to the foundation in July 2006, the year after he was arrested following a complaint he abused a 14-year-old, the Guardian reported. Another HSBC Geneva client, restaurateur Richard Caring, transferred $1million to the foundation, seemingly in return for Mr Clinton's attendance at a charity ball in 2005. It is not illegal to hold a Swiss bank account and there is no evidence any of the donors used accounts to avoid tax. The foundation keeps a public database of donors and says all donations are vetted carefully. Furious MPs have accused HMRC of 'failing' the public by letting wealthy tax avoiders 'get away with' stashing their cash in Swiss bank accounts. The Chair of the House of Commons Public Accounts Committee Margaret Hodge said she was furious at the 'pathetic' response to leaked HSBC files showing thousands of British-based individuals held bank accounts in Switzerland. She said the tax authorities had failed to serve British taxpayers' interests in their response to the leak in 2010. Chair of the House of Commons Public Accounts Committee Margaret Hodge said she was furious at the 'pathetic' response to leaked HSBC files . HMRC permanent secretary Lin Homer insisted that HMRC staff had been 'diligent' in their approach to the files . HM Revenue and Customs has only secured one prosecution from a list of 6,800 UK-related accounts provided  by French authorities five years ago. Ms Hodge said it appeared that activities related to the Geneva branch of HSBC's Swiss subsidiary were 'pretty outrageous' and told HMRC permanent secretary Lin Homer that taxmen should have spoken to whistleblower Herve Falciani, who initially obtained the list while employed as an IT worker in 2007. Ms Homer insisted that HMRC staff had been 'diligent' in their approach to the files, and said their record of securing one conviction and £135 million in unpaid tax, fines and interest compared well with other countries. But Ms Hodge told her that the French tax authorities had recouped £200 million from 3,000 names and the Spanish £180 million from 2,900. And she told the HMRC chief: 'It's pretty outrageous what was going on. 'It's the first time in many of these leaks that there are really strong allegations not of egregious tax avoidance, but of tax evasion, and that is incredibly serious. 'For you to sit there and say, as you are doing, that ""We couldn't get the money in in the same way as the French and Spanish did"" and ""We didn't litigate because we wanted to get the money in"" and yet you did worse on the money - it leaves me believing that you are not serving the British taxpayer.'","Former Tory treasurer Stanley Fink  named on Swiss bank account list .

"The Duchess of Cambridge chatted about Prince George, the new royal baby and did a turn on a ukulele during a private visit to a children's hospice yesterday. She was visiting the Bethlem and Maudsley Hospital School in south London and followed up the engagement, which was not publicised in advance, with a reception  this morning. The reception, which was also a private engagement, was to discuss the Royal Foundation's support for hospices offering palliative care for young children. Scroll down for video . Having fun: Kate, who visited a school yesterday, with a little boy during a visit to the Scouts in January . Kate has long been a supporter of children's wellbeing initiatives and is patron of East Anglia Children's Hospices (EACH).

The Duchess, who is around six and a half months pregnant, has been working in private since returning from a two week break in Mustique with Prince George, the Duke of Cambridge and her family on Friday. First on her agenda was the visit to Bethlem and Maudsley School which educates children with long term illnesses who are being treated at the nearby Bethlem Royal and Maudsley Hospitals. Speaking after the visit, headteacher Dr John Ivens revealed that, along with managing to keep up during a ukulele lesson, the Duchess proved herself a good listener. 'One of the boys managed to teach the Duchess a couple of chords on the ukulele,' revealed Dr Ivens. 'She kept up with them.' Touched: The Duchess was left noticeably tearful by Leigh Smith's story, told during a visit to EACH . Back in London: The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge flew home to the UK last Friday .

Jokingly, he quipped: 'There’s a career there.' 'The Duchess is very good at listening to what people are saying to her, especially children, and responding in a thoughtful way,' added Dr Ivens. 'Clearly it was very important for her to understand how young people get to a situation that they need to be an in-patient at such a young age. 'It was clear that her intention in coming was to find out more about this area. She talked a little bit about that with the children and about what George likes. It was lovely.' Dr Ivens, an educational psychologist, is also involved with another of the Duchess' charities, children's mental health organisation, Place2Be. Although not part of the group who attended a reception at Kensington Palace in November, Dr Ivens did speak at a Place2Be conference, which the Duchess attended, in June. Welfare: A day earlier, she had visited another child welfare charity, The Art Room . Mental health: In November, Kate hosted a reception for children's mental welbeing charity, Place2Be . Proficient: The Duchess proved herself adept at playing the ukulele during yesterday's visit . While today's visit was noticeably light on the ukuleles, the reception saw the Duchess speak to some of the people involved with the Royal Foundation's child wellbeing programme. The Foundation, which is a vehicle for the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and Prince Harry's philanthropic work, holds regular catch-up meetings between the royals and charity representatives to catch up .

It will be her first public engagement since January 19th, when she carried out a series of visits in London and revealed that while she doesn't know the sex of her baby, she can feel it kicking while  on official royal duties. Big plans: She will visit Sir Ben Ainslie  tomorrow, seen here at the launch of the UK bid for the America's Cup .

"These are the dramatic scenes as a Greek search and rescue helicopter winched 22 crew members from a Cypriot cargo vessel which ran aground earlier today. The Goodfaith cargo ship was sailing empty from Elefsina, near Athens, to Odessa in the Ukraine. It is understood the cargo vessel lost power and was driven ashore by strong winds onto the island of Andros. Scroll down for video . A Greek military helicopter, circled swooped low over the deck of the stricken Goodfaith cargo vessel which ran aground on the northern part of Andros Island, Greece earlier today with 22 crew aboard when the vessel lost power and pushed onto the rocks by strong winds . The Goodfaith, pictured, was on its way to Odessa, Ukraine when it got into difficulty in the early hours of this morning in the Aegean Sea . Greek authorities confirmed that all of the 22 crew aboard the vessel, pictured,  have been rescued after this morning's dramatic incident . Crew issued a distress signal in the early hours of the morning after being unable to prevent the cargo vessel drift towards the rocky shoreline. The Goodfaith is understood to have traveled from Istanbul in Turkey before unloading in Elefsina. Three tugs have reached the 16,000 tonne vessel in a bid to prevent it from being damaged further. The vessel, which has run aground in the Aegean Sea, was built in 1994. It is understood the captain reported that his vessel was taking on water. This latest maritime accident comes as the captain of the Costa Concordia, branded Captain Coward, was found guilty of manslaughter after his ship ran aground of the Italian island of Gigilo in 2012 claiming 32 lives. Francesco Schettino, dubbed 'Captain Coward' after he fled the ship before the 4,200 passengers were safely ashore, was handed the sentence this evening in Grosseto, Tuscany. The 54-year-old was given ten years for manslaughter, five for causing a shipwreck, one for abandoning ship, and a further month for giving false information to port authorities. His lawyers had launched a last-minute appeal yesterday attempting to blame the rest of the crew for the accident, but their attempts failed. But despite the guilty verdict today, Schettino remains a free man and still has the right to two legal appeals which can take years to process, meaning he may never see the inside of a cell.

"Since many hotel rooms sit empty during the day, it simply makes economical sense for them to be rented by the hour to weary travellers. While there is still a bit of a social stigma attached to booking rooms for a very short-term stay, there's now a startup, called HotelsByDay, looking to change all that. According to the app, such booking schedules will likely appeal to business travellers looking to take a nap or work between meetings, while families may simply want a quiet place to wait for a flight with their kids. Despite the stigma attached to booking hotel rooms during the day, HotelsByDay is aiming to change this . But will the public embrace it? Speaking to Mashable, HotelsByDay co-founder, Yannis Moati, said: 'We think there is a stigma in the industry and we've structured the whole company around moving away from this. 'We don't sell hourly rates,' he clarified. The new app allows weary travellers the ability to check in to a hotel for a block of time during the day . The app's co-founder explains that such an option is great for holidaying families en route to the airport . Instead, the app allows you to book a hotel for a block of hours, usually beginning in the morning and running through the afternoon or early evening. Moati also points out that the rates are about 40 per cent less than a normal rate on the room. 'We don't sell nights, so the conversion is actually [booking] commission free,' Moati explained. 'We're the only sharing economy tool that drives business back to hotels.' Such a feature would also benefit weary business travellers who are only in town for several hours . Not only that but the sleek and stylish app is actually extremely easy to use. Just type in your location and filter hotels by area, check-in times and dates. You can also search for specific amenities and price points, provided you live in - or are visiting - New York City, Chicago, Philadelphia, or Washington. The company does plan to expand to Los Angeles, Boston and Atlanta, among other top US destinations, soon. The app is currently available for free download on Google Play and in the App Store.","Hotel rooms often sit empty during the day and this app aims to fill them .

"Marilyn Brown, 78, has been jailed for stealing £55,000 from her best friend of almost 70 years . A heartless pensioner has been jailed for stealing £55,000 from her widowed best friend of almost 70 years. Callous Marilyn Brown, 78, spent years systematically defrauding pal Frances Tarne out of her inheritance following the death of her husband. Despite being best friends since childhood cruel Brown took total control of her finances and sent her just £75-a-fortnight to live. Trusting Frances, also 78, was left living in near poverty in Brighton while greedy Brown splashed her money on herself and her home in Christchurch, Dorset. The alarm was raised when friends visited widowed Frances and found her living in squalor in June 2011 despite being left a tidy sum by her husband. Mean Brown had left her with so little money she could not afford a headstone for her husband's grave. She also cancelled her TV licence and cable TV package and took away her car. Brown pleaded guilty to theft on the day of her planned trial in November and last Thursday was jailed for 18 months at Hove Crown Court. Judge Shani Barnes said: 'Your old friend who you had known since childhood lost her husband and something in you went seriously wrong. 'Whether it was jealousy, whether it was greed or something else, you systematically stole from her all that she had. 'You removed her dignity, her confidence and everything she believed to be true. You took away her health, her money, her pension, her trust. 'If you were 20 years younger, you would be going to prison for three years, no question.' Detective Constable Tracey Dixon said: 'I remain astounded that the victim's all but lifelong friend could be so callous and so cruel. 'She didn't even order or pay for a headstone for her deceased husband's grave. 'I am very pleased with the sentence that Marilyn Brown has received.'

"A student dressed up as a slave, with blood marks on his back as if he has been whipped, for Throwback Thursday in Loudoun County . Parents have spoken of their horror after a student dressed up a slave, daubing red stains on his back to look like he had been whipped for Throwback Thursday. The African American student had donned the costume for the tradition, which allows students to dress up in vintage outfits, at Loudoun County's Heritage High School in Leesburg. But parents were angry that he had been allowed to wear the slave costume for the whole day, NBC reported. A mother, who did not want to be identified, told the broadcaster: 'I was livid. I couldn't believe what I was hearing in 2015. Are you kidding me?' As well as blood daubed on the back of a white shirt the student's costume included a message that said 'Property of Heritage High School.' He also carried a bag of cotton wool balls that he dropped throughout the campus. The woman added: 'What if someone came dressed as the Holocaust or the Klan? Is that then considered inappropriate? Where is the line? You are dealing with teenagers.' Wayde Byard, spokesman for the school, claims the student was told his costume was 'tasteless' and 'really pushing the boundaries.' He said the teenager was told if someone complained he would need to remove the outfit and he was not allowed to take part in the competition. But he said they decided the costume did not break the dress code and he was allowed to exercise his right to free speech. 'There is a very fine line here between free speech and good taste. As we know, free speech is not always tasteful speech.' He also admitted had the student been white they may have been ordered to remove the costume because it could have created racial tensions. On a twitter feed that appears to belong to the student who wore the controversial costume, he said: 'This story made me look so bad, this isn't what I meant by this.'  Earlier, as news broke of the reaction to the outfit, he said: 'This is bad, very bad.' Loudoun County Heritage School said the costume was 'tasteless' but allowed the student to wear it . In another post the teenager said: 'Yeah I just got grounded for all this.' The outfit provoked different comments on Twitter, with many of the teenager's friends praising him and other members of the public supporting free expression. Matthew wrote: 'it's a great costume! I would have done the same thing. It's a free expression. It would be a great costume for Halloween.' Others supported the right to free speech, but some said it violated boundaries and needed a response from the school.","Parent complained after student at daughter's school dressed as a slave .

"Two lucky divers have escaped an up-close encounter with a four-metre shark, spotting the mammoth creature swimming next to their boat just as they were preparing to enter the water. Dustin Blesse and Adrian Blundell were on a boat in Newcastle Harbour, in NSW, when the shark swam up to their three-metre vessel on Tuesday. Footage of the encounter shows the shark pausing slightly as it approaches the boat, and then swimming underneath and emerging on the other side. Scroll down for video . Dustin Blesse and Adrian Blundell were on a boat when the four-metre shark swam up to their vessel . Mr Besse, 31, is heard to exclaim loudly, 'Holy s***!', as he captures the enormous shark approaching the boat. His diving partner, Mr Blundell, is shown to be in full diving gear, including a wetsuit and mask. Mr Besse askes him, 'You want to get in?', to which Mr Blundell shakes his head emphatically. Mr Besse, an experienced diver, said that the pair took off their diving equipment and waited before heading back in. 'We saw it again and didn't see it and we waited about two hours and I ended up going in and finished the job off,' Mr Besse told The Sydney Morning Herald. Footage of the encounter shows the shark pausing slightly as it approaches the boat, and then swimming underneath and emerging on the other side . Mr Blundell, is shown to be in full diving gear, including a wetsuit and mask . Mr Besse askes him, 'You want to get in?', to which Mr Blundell shakes his head emphatically . The men both work for diving company Harbourworks, and are used to the fact that sharks are often in the water. 'It is not as if they are just there today, they are always there. We do a lot of work in the harbour where there is zero visibility - if you can see your hand, it is a very good day,' Mr Besse said. Divers from the Harbourworks company had discussed the fact of sharks on Tuesday said owner and operations manager Dave Purser. The talk came after Japanese national Tadashi Nakahara, 41, was killed in a tragic shark attack at popular surfing spot Shelly Beach on New South Wales' north coast on Monday. The surfboard technician, was reportedly sitting on his board just 10 metres from shore near four other surfers  when the shark - believed to be a four-metre great white - attacked. Authorities resumed their search for the shark using helicopters, rescue boats and jet skis on Tuesday as beaches between South Ballina and Lennox Head remain closed and lifeguards are patrolling to ensure swimmers stay out of the water. 41-year-old Japanese national Tadashi Nakahara (pictured left) died after being attacked by a shark in Ballina . It has now emerged footage of the incident, which happened just before 8am local time, was captured by Coastalwatch's surf cam . Speaking to Daily Mail Australia just after the incident happened, a worker from the Australian Hotel in Ballina said the man worked at Websters Surfboards on the outskirts of the city and was an avid surfer. The victim lost both his legs and the other surfers brought him to shore where they tried to tend to his injuries and administered CPR, but he lost too much blood and was pronounced dead at the scene. Ballina Mayor David Wright said a shark expert from the Department of Primary Industries was heading to Ballina to investigate. The surfers who were with Mr Nakahara described the shark as being three to four metres long, Cr Wright told ABC Radio. 'It came up behind and took his board and his legs and that's a horrible thing to happen,' he said. Cr Wright said the water was warm and a lot of fish were feeding close to the surface which can attract sharks. 'The fish are travelling through and the predators ... come in and try and get it - there were lots of dolphins there yesterday going through, seven or eight, attacking the fish too,' he said. Cr Wright believes the chances of finding the shark were quite remote. Mr Nakahara was from Japan but had been living in the area for a number of years. He has been formally identified and police are working with the Japanese consulate to inform his family of his death. Local residents lay flowers at the beach where the Japanese surfer was killed by a shark. Authorities closed the beach, near Ballina in northern NSW . Authorities are searching for the shark - believed to be a four-metre great white - using helicopters, rescue boats and jet skis . On Monday, Detective Inspector Cameron Lindsay said a witness had been filming the beach at the time but said the footage appeared to have been taken after the attack. 'At this stage we don’t believe we have video of the actual attack,' Det Insp Lindsay said. 'What it appears to capture is a large amount of blood in the water.' Friends of the man told local cafe owner, Karen, the shark came out from nowhere. 'It just came up between a bunch of surfers,' she told AAP on Monday. 'They weren't even that far out. 'He lost both his legs.' The victim's friends were shaken up and looked 'white as a ghost' as they carried their mate's board away from the beach, the local said. Authorities kept swimmers and surfers out of the water after today's fatal attack by a shark, which severed both of the man's legs . On the day of the incident, Cr Wright said authorities believed it could be the same shark that attacked a surfer at nearby Seven Mile Beach on Sunday. 'Now the sharks had two bites, if it's the same one, we certainly have to keep our eyes on it,' he said. Cr Wright said surf life saving helicopters, jet skis and boats were now searching for the great white. 'It's a pretty big shark so it's most likely gone,' he said. Paramedics at Shelly Beach attempted to revive the man following the attack just before 10am on Monday but he was pronounced dead at the scene . Three other surfers pulled the victim out of the water following the attack just before 10am on Monday and said the shark was about four metres long, the Ballina Shire Advocate reported. 'The people who pulled him out weren't all that old so we're trying to get some counselling for them,' Cr Wright said. NSW Life Saving Manager Andy Kent said lifeguards had been stationed at all beaches in the Ballina Shire to keep the public informed and out of the water. 'This is obviously a very serious incident and we would ask that the public follow the directions of emergency service workers and lifeguards by remaining clear of the water,' Mr Kent said. 'Our thoughts go out to the man's family and friends, who are dealing with this tragedy.' The man's death brings the number of shark attacks to six in the past year and four in the past five months in Australia. There have been 174 fatal shark attacks in the past 100 years and 809 attacks reported. The beach will stay closed until authorities decide it is safe for swimmers to return to the water . Father-of-one Jabez Reitman suffered back lacerations and received stitches at Gold Coast University Hospital . This comes a day after a surfer was injured in a shark attack at nearby Seven Mile Beach when he mistook the creature for a dolphin. Father-of-one Jabez Reitman, 35, suffered back lacerations and was rushed to Gold Coast University Hospital from Seven Mile Beach in Broken Head, south of Byron Bay on New South Wales' north coast. Mr Reitman claims the shark was two to three metres long. The Byron Bay man says he panicked when he realised he was hurt as he had been completely unaware a shark was nearby, according to Seven News. 'I just freaked out you know, I thought it was a dolphin at first, until it (his back) started stinging,' he told Seven. 'I didn't realise that there are some pretty bad lacerations.' The keen swimmer says he is not deterred by the suspected shark attack and is keenly awaiting his return to the water. The Byron Bay man says he panicked when he realised he was hurt as he had been completely unaware a shark was nearby. At first, he mistook the creature for a dolphin .

"One of the three pilots on board a helicopter Brian Williams falsely claimed to have been travelling on when it was gunned down Iraq has given his version of the three days he spent with the millionaire NBC news anchor. Williams, anchor and Managing Editor of the flagship Nightly News show, had been under fire for 11 days after being called out on the overblown story by indignant veterans of the 2003 invasion. Bosses at the network finally suspended Williams without pay for six months acted after deciding his own decision to remove himself from anchoring for 'several days' over the 'completely inappropriate' claim was not enough. Now Army pilot and father of four Allan Kelly, 44, has revealed what really happened on board the Chinook aircraft, saying the aircraft did not come under fire at any time during the completely routine mission and that he and Williams passed the time complaining about their cars. Scroll down for videos . Truth: Pilot Allan Kelly, 44, (pictured) has revealed what really happened in Iraq, saying the Chinook did not come under fire at any time during the mission and that he and Williams passed the time talking about cars . Suspended: Brian Williams's pay has been stopped for six months during the suspension. The decision was announced by the British president of NBC News, Deborah Turness, right . Kelly said he is reluctant to join those lambasting Williams for his version of events, but told Minnesota's StarTribune that he just wants the truth to be revealed. 'Whatever Brian Williams may or may not be guilty of or what he may or may not have said, that's a reflection on him. It doesn't have anything to do with me... I did my job, and part of my job was to take Brian Williams and his crew on a mission,' he told the newspaper. Williams' story of being on board a Chinook helicopter during the 2003 Iraq invasion has reportedly changed over the years, but on January 30 he repeated the often-told version about the aircraft being hit by gun and rocket fire and being forced to make an emergency landing. The pilot, Williams claimed, was later given a Purple Heart - a medal awarded by the U.S. military for those injured or killed while serving. Kelly says that at no point did the helicopter take fire and said he was not awarded a Purple Heart. Instead he says that during the mission a call came over the radio saying a Chinook helicopter that left the base in Kuwait 30 minutes before Kelly's aircraft had been hit by bullets and a rocket-propelled grenade, and that the pilot of that helicopter had landed the aircraft safely. News of that attack had forced Kelly and another Chinook pilot to turn their aircraft around in the middle of a sandstorm, which took between 15 minutes and half an hour, but he said nobody was hurt - even though the fear of attack and the reduced visibility made it a 'pretty big emotional event'. Boots on the ground: Williams, pictured above covering Iraq, was pulled up by veterans on an overblown story of being aboard a helicopter hit by an RPG - which it emerged he was not on at all . In danger? Williams also gave a contentious account of his time covering Israel's war with Hezbollah - once claiming there was rocket fire 'just underneath' the helicopter (above) he was riding in - a detail that was notably absent from his reporting at the time . For the bulk of the mission, Kelly said, Williams and his two NBC colleagues sat around the army's desert camp chatting among themselves and with soldiers. 'We were sitting around talking about cars and I was complaining about the poor service I got at a Saturn dealership,' Kelly said. Williams commented about the poor service he got at a Mercedes-Benz dealership,' he added. 'I realized we're from two different worlds. He's a millionaire and I'm just a grunt,' Kelly said. 'We're not from the same neighborhood.' After retelling his Iraq story on January 30, Wiliams was called out on the tall tale by veterans who objected to his glory-grabbing. Williams issued an on-air apology - and said he had been in a 'following' helicopter. This detail too came under scrutiny, and it emerged his chopper had been part of a different mission and was around half an hour behind, as Kelly has now confirmed. Stand-in: Lester Holt, right, will fill the Nightly News anchor's chair while Williams is suspended . In a note sent to NBC staff, Deborah Turness, the president of NBC's news division, described his puffed-up retellings of events from 2003 as 'wrong and completely inappropriate'. In the mean time Lester Holt, who has already covered two broadcasts for Williams, will sit in the Nightly News anchor's chair. The scandal began on January 30, when Williams repeated an often-told anecdote about being on board a Chinook helicopter during the 2003 Iraq invasion. He said that he was on board a chopper which got hit by a rocket-propelled grenade and was forced to land. In fact, he was on a completely different helicopter. After being called out on the tall tale by veterans who objected to his glory-grabbing, Williams issued an on-air apology - and said he had been in a 'following' helicopter. This detail too came under scrutiny, and it emerged his chopper had been part of a different mission and was around half an hour behind. Dead body? Another Williams anecdote - of seeing a dead body float down a street in New Orleans's French Quarter during Hurricane Katrina, has now also been called into question . His plight worsened after other grand, personal stories - from Hurricane Katrina, Israel's 2006 war with Hezbollah, and even a childhood tale of being mugged - were also called into question. In her note, Turness wrote: 'We have decided today to suspend Brian Williams as Managing Editor and Anchor of NBC Nightly News for six months. 'The suspension will be without pay and is effective immediately.' 'While on Nightly News on Friday, January 30, 2015, Brian misrepresented events which occurred while he was covering the Iraq War in 2003. 'It then became clear that on other occasions Brian had done the same while telling that story in other venues. This was wrong and completely inappropriate for someone in Brian's position. 'In addition, we have concerns about comments that occurred outside NBC News while Brian was talking about his experiences in the field. Currently off the air after he admitted to lying about being hit by enemy fire in Iraq, a number of Williams' other seemingly outlandish claims are currently coming under increased scrutiny . Red Bank, New Jersey, 1970s . In a 2011 interview, Brian Williams recalled his time as a teenage volunteer firefighter during which he saved a puppy. However in a 2005 Esquire interview, Williams had claimed to save not one but two puppies. In the same Esquire interview Williams also revealed that he had been mugged at gunpoint while selling Christmas trees in the sleepy New Jersey town in which he grew up. A number of locals have questioned the credibility of his claim that someone 'stuck a .38-caliber in my face'. Iraq War, 2003 . Over the years Williams has told multiple versions of a story about being in an Army Chinook helicopter during the Iraq War in 2003. Last month he claimed his helicopter was hit by ground fire, an allegation he was later forced to admit was false after an outcry from soldiers who were present. Williams issued an on-air apology and wrote on Facebook: 'Nobody's trying to steal anyone's valor.' Hurricane Katrina, 2005 . Williams has told several stories about his experiences reporting from New Orleans. He has claimed to have seen a dead body float past the window of his hotel in the city's French Quarter – even though the area wasn't flooded. The accuracy of other Katrina claims, including that he caught dysentery drinking the flood waters and that his hotel was 'overrun' with gangs, have been called into question by others who were on the ground during the disaster. Israel, 2006 . In a 2007 interview with Fairfield University Student Television, Williams recalled 'Katyusha rockets passing just underneath the helicopter I was riding in' during a trip to Israel. In fact he was nowhere near enemy fire and in a broadcast segment filmed that day he described rocket fire 'six miles away'. Boston, 2006 . A Navy vet accused Williams of lying to skip an event honoring members of the Armed Forces so that he could appear on Saturday Night Live. On the day of the Congressional Medal of Honor Society event the NBC News anchor told organizers that a 'pressing engagement' meant he wouldn't be able speak at the dinner, but later that evening he appeared in a walk-on role on SNL's Weekend Update.","Alan Kelly was one of three pilots on board Chinook aircraft with Williams .

"Samsung's next generation Galaxy handset is set to come in two versions - one with  a curved screen that covers both its sides. Both phones will have all-metal bodies and 5.1inch screens, it has been claimed. 'Samsung Electronics Co. plans to release two new versions of its top-tier Galaxy smartphone next month, including a model with a display covering three sides, according to people with direct knowledge of the matter,' Bloomberg said. Scroll down for video . A Samsung Galaxy Note E, the first to use Samsung's curved screen. It is claimed the Galaxy S6 could come in a special edition with both sides featuring the technology. Previous leaks from BGR say the SM-G925F, the codename believed to be assigned to the Galaxy S6, will feature a Quad HD (2560 x 1440 resolution) 5.5inch display. It will also have an octa-core processor, Mali-T768 graphics processing unit, and a 16-megapixel rear-facing camera. The handset is expected to be unveiled at Mobile World Congress, a trade show in Barcelona, which takes place from 2-5 March. The  'special edition' version will have the curved technology, according to Sammobile. The Korean giant believes its curved technology could give it an edge over arch rival Apple. The handset is expected to be unveiled at Mobile World Congress, a trade show in Barcelona, which takes place from 2-5 March. 'Today, we can confirm that Samsung is indeed developing a Galaxy S6 with two-edge displays, one on each side, reports our source,' said the Sammobile site. The curved screen has already been used  in Samsung's Note Edge. However, S6 Edge will have the ability to work in a left or right handed mode . 'You will have an option to choose favourite contacts and an ability to assign specific colours to them,' explained Sammobile. 'So, calls and notifications from important people will show the designated color lighting on the edge area.' Samsung surprised audiences at the Berlin-based trade show IFA in September when it unveiled its curved device. The screen was described by Samsung's David Park at the event as working like a 'ticker', with notifications and news scrolling along it. The Galaxy Note Edge's unique curved touchscreen provides quick access to frequently used apps and alerts. The curved screen displays notifications at the top and bottom, while viewing a video without disruption, for example. These images, which appear to have been taken in a toilet, show a rounded edge and antenna bars almost identical to Apple's iPhone 6 in the 'standard' version of the handset . Because the curved edge remains visible even if a flip-book style protective cover is used, it is easier to keep up-to-date with incoming calls and messages. Previous leaks from BGR say the SM-G925F — the codename believed to be assigned to the Galaxy S6 — will feature a Quad HD (2560 x 1440 resolution) display, octa-core processor, Mali-T768 graphics processing unit, and a 16-megapixel rear-facing camera. Earlier this month, in the face of stiff competition, and following a consecutive drop in profits, Samsung announced plans to curb the number of phones it makes each year. Instead of releasing handset after handset and saturating the market with Samsung devices, the firm has decided it needs to concentrate on making fewer handsets, better. The South Korean manufacturer is also expected to ramp up production of its remaining models so they can be sold more cheaply. Apple's On 1 March, Samsung and HTC are separately hosting events in Barcelona, to kick off this year's Mobile World Congress (MWC). HTC is expected to unveil its HTC One M9, while Samsung will likely use its event to announce the Samsung Galaxy S6. Samsung's invite hints at a curved device (pictured) Despite a drop in profits, Samsung has retained its leading position in the global smartphone market during the last quarter. But, it was the only top five manufacturer to record a sales decline. Apple, Xiaomi, Lenovo and LG all posted more than 15 per cent growth in their smartphone shipments, according to market research firm IDC. Samsung's shipments fell 8 per cent to 78.1 million smartphones in the third quarter, and its market share eroded to 24 per cent from 33 per cent this time last year. Samsung's rise to the world's top smartphone maker was helped by its partnership with Google's Android operating system. But other Android handset makers are matching Samsung in terms of performance, features and design. Shares of Samsung Electronics did rise 4 per cent, however, in Seoul. Although the earnings were weak, they were better than some forecasts. Plus Samsung said it is expecting a strong fourth quarter in the run up to Christmas. The strategy was unveiled during a presentation in New York by Samsung's head of investor relations, Robert Yi. He said the company would reduce the number of smartphone models in 2015 by between a quarter and a third. Last month, for the third consecutive quarter, Samsung's profits took a hit. The smartphone maker reported its lowest quarterly earnings in three years, after profits plummeted by 60 per cent compared to the same time last year. Compared to a record-high of £6 billion ($9.5 billion) in 2013, the company achieved £2.5 billion ($3.8 billion) profits for July to September. These figures were in line with what Samsung predicted earlier in October, and the firm blamed the drop on weak sales of its new Galaxy model. The South Korean electronics giant became the biggest smartphone brand thanks to the popularity of earlier Galaxy models. But the larger screen on Apple's new iPhone 6 has been linked with luring customers away from the larger Galaxy range. While in China, local brands are making inroads into Samsung's business. In response to the dramatic drop, Samsung also vowed to revamp its smartphone range to win back customers. Executives at the South Korean firm said it would overhaul its lower-tier line-up to boost price competitiveness, and use higher-quality components to set its devices apart. 'The mid-to-low end market is growing rapidly, and we plan to respond actively in order to capitalise on that growth,' said Samsung Senior Vice President Kim Hyun-joon during a conference call with analysts. In a rare acknowledgement, Mr Yi added that Samsung had lagged behind changing market conditions. Analysts claim the bigger iPhones released last month (shown) will likely take away customers who favoured Samsung Galaxy's larger screens. In emerging markets, such as India and China, Samsung's smartphone sales have been overtaken by local rivals . The company's response 'was not quick enough,' said Mr Yi. The earnings were below the median of analysts' expectations of £3 billion ($4.9 billion), according to FactSet, a financial data provider. The decline in Galaxy sales has also hurt demand for Samsung components such as an advanced display called OLED. 'The operating margin declined due to increased marketing expenditure and lowered average selling price,' Samsung said. The company said it 'cautiously expects increased shipments of new smartphones and strong seasonal demand for TV products'. The latest profit drop comes despite the launch of the Samsung Galaxy S5 (pictured) earlier this year, which was received by mostly rave reviews. The Galaxy S5 handpicked features from its competitors and put them all into a single handset, with some calling it a 'superphone' In emerging markets, such as India and China, Samsung's smartphone sales were overtaken by local rivals. 'Rather than seeking stability, Samsung should seek to distinguish [its phones] with Galaxy's design policies,' Lee Seung-woo, an analyst at IBK Securities said. The company moved the launch of the Galaxy Note 4, a large smartphone with a stylus, to late September from October after Apple unveiled the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus. It also began sales of the Galaxy Note 4 in China last month, getting an early start in the world's most populous country before Apple.","The handset set to have a 5.1inch screen and mental body .

"A Florida man who allegedly kidnapped a businessman in Thailand and tried to collect a $2 million ransom has been denied bail while he fights extradition. Shawn Abraham Shaw was arrested in Palm Beach in November after Thai authorities accused him of drugging, kidnapping and threatening to kill the man during a 2013 trip to Phuket. But Shaw claims he is being framed by the alleged victim - a Las Vegas businessman who travels to Thailand for work - because he wants to steal one of his ideas. A US federal judge deemed the 43-year-old a flight risk and refused to release him from jail ahead of the extradition hearing next month, according to the Sun Sentinel . Judge William Matthewman  said the Thai authorities appear to have conducted an independent investigation and have sufficient evidence to file criminal charges, the newspaper reported. If extradited Shaw's attorney has said he could face life behind bars or even death if he is convicted or the plot. 'Plot': Shawn Abraham Shaw, 43, traveled to the Thai island of Phuket, pictured, in December 2013, where he drugged, kidnapped and then extorted millions from a friend, officials said. He has denied the claims . The extradition hearing is scheduled for March 3 in the federal court in West Palm Beach. The judge said he would reconsider the Thai authorities  evidence then, the Sun Sentinel reported. The two men got to know each other while working out in the same gym when Shaw lived in Las Vegas, his attorney said, the Palm Beach Post reported. Years later, Shaw came up with an idea to recover millions in uncashed gambling chips that people take home with them from trips to Las Vegas. He then traveled to Thailand to see if the other man, identified only as AMA in court records, wanted to join him in his venture, he said. His fiance, Dawn Pasqualucci, joined him on the trip and they stayed at the man's house before leaving on good terms in December 2013, they said. But a month later, when negotiations for the business venture fell through, AMA went to authorities and told them Shaw had kidnapped him, Shaw's attorney Michael Cohen told a judge at an earlier hearing. 'The so-called extortion never took place,' the attorney insisted. But Thai officials and the alleged victim tell a very different story. They said that one night, Shaw and AMA were out drinking when AMA started to feel dizzy and passed out. A barman told officials that he Shaw assist or carry AMA outside of the bar. They got into a car, where Shaw allegedly restrained the man with plastic zip ties around his wrists, ankles and neck before taking him to a building and holding him overnight. He allegedly threatened to kill the man unless he handed over $3 million. They negotiated the amount down to $2 million, which was paid to Shaw when he returned to the U.S. Shaw's new defense lawyer, Jason Kreiss, claimed at another previous hearing that emails from the time show that his client's activities involved a legitimate business deal, the Sun Sentinel reported. Arrest: He was arrested at his girlfriend' home on this beach-front street in Palm Beach in November and has been held in custody ever since. He now faces extradition to Thailand to answer to the charges . The alleged victim did not report the incident to authorities until several weeks after Shaw had left the country, claiming he feared for his life and worried he would hurt his family. Pasqualucci, 45, testified that she believed the alleged victim was a pedophile who frequented transgender bars in Thailand and that he had dished out threats of his own. She said he had threatened to have them killed if they revealed that Shaw had seen something on the victim's computer that indicated, 'He likes little boys', the Sun Sentinel reported. Shaw is a Guyana-born U.S. citizen who has lived in the states for about 35 years. Federal prosecutor Aurora Fagan told the court last month that the Thai authorities should be the ones decided whose story is the true one. 'We're dealing with international law and international relations,' she said. 'They (Thai authorities) should not have to litigate their case here in American courts.'","Shawn Abraham Shaw accused of kidnapping a businessman in Thailand .

"HMRC bosses knew about the HSBC tax scandal eight months before the bank's chairman was appointed as a Government minister, it emerged last night. The agency received a copy of the list of clients with millions stashed away in Switzerland before Lord Green of Hurstpierpoint was brought in to government in January 2011. Labour said it 'beggared belief' that HMRC would not have reported to the Chancellor about problems at the bank when it began investigating the individuals concerned for tax evasion. Questions: Lord Green (left) was a Tory trade minister and Dave Hartnett (right) was then HMRC's head of tax . Today, HMRC will be grilled over its treatment of tax avoiders. Chief executive Lin Homer and top officials Edward Troup and Jim Harra will meet the Commons public accounts committee. HMRC was asked to vet Lord Green before his appointment, but only about his personal tax arrangements. That was despite a formal investigation by HMRC into the HSBC accounts from at least as early as October 2011. But Downing Street insisted ministers knew nothing about the client list when David Cameron made Stephen Green a Tory peer and then trade minister. Shadow chancellor Ed Balls told the BBC the Government was 'in an utter state of confusion' over the issue. Accusations: Ed Balls said it 'beggars belief' that HMRC would not have informed the Chancellor in 2011 . He said: 'Something on this scale and of this seriousness, in my experience of many years in the Treasury, it beggars belief that HMRC would not have told the Chancellor of this systemic problem. It's also staggering that Lord Green could be appointed to government . . . without apparently anybody discussing whether or not that was appropriate, given these ongoing allegations.' Mr Cameron has said Lord Green was an 'excellent' trade minister, and ministers insist there is no evidence he was involved in any tax evasion. The billionaire paedophile friend of Prince Andrew was among HSBC offshore investors named in the leaked account files. The data links Jeffrey Epstein to several private accounts in Geneva, including one in his own name which held £2.3million. Epstein, above right, who was jailed for 13 months in 2008 for soliciting sex with underage girls, was last month accused of employing teenage ‘sex slave’ Virginia Roberts, who claimed he made her sleep with Prince Andrew when she was 17. Buckingham Palace has denied the Duke of York had ‘any form of sexual contact or relationship with Virginia Roberts’ and Epstein has called her claims ‘outlandish and offensive’. The disgraced hedge fund manager is one of seven clients of HSBC’s private banking arm in Geneva known to have donated to the charitable foundation run by former US president Bill Clinton and his wife Hillary. Miss Roberts, now 31 and a mother of three, has said she met Mr Clinton twice but was never ‘lent out’ to him. She claimed Epstein told her: ‘He owes me some favours.’ Epstein gave $25,000 (£16,400) to the foundation in July 2006, the year after he was arrested following a complaint he abused a 14-year-old, the Guardian reported. Another HSBC Geneva client, restaurateur Richard Caring, transferred $1million to the foundation, seemingly in return for Mr Clinton’s attendance at a charity ball in 2005. It is not illegal to hold a Swiss bank account and there is no evidence any of the donors used accounts to avoid tax. The foundation keeps a public database of donors and says all donations are vetted carefully. Sajid Javid told Channel 4 News there was 'no evidence of any conspiracy'. The culture secretary insisted that HMRC is 'independent of day-to-day government'. But the revelation that thousands of 'black' accounts were used to stash millions and avoid tax has caused outrage. Bank records were stolen by a whistleblower in 2007, but did not reach Britain until 2010 after a deal between HMRC and the French authorities. Officials say part of the deal was that the taxman could not pass on the details. Since then only one person has been prosecuted despite £135million being recovered. The Guardian reported Dave Hartnett, HMRC's then head of tax, as saying that the taxman was required to 'provide an indication of reputational risk for appointments of peers in relation to their tax compliance history only'. In a letter to George Osborne yesterday, Labour frontbencher Shabana Mahmood wrote that, if ministers knew about the claims, 'failure to ask probing questions would have to be seen as wilfully negligent. As chairman of the bank, Mr Green would either have been aware of malpractice or, if not, surely questions would arise as to why not.' Yesterday Downing Street initially said that neither Lord Green, who stepped down as a minister in 2013, nor any other member of the Government, had 'any knowledge that HSBC may have been involved in wrongdoing' until it was reported in newspapers and by the BBC in recent days. But the comments were at odds with claims by Treasury minister David Gauke, who told the Commons on Monday that information about HSBC had been 'in the public domain since 2007'. Downing Street later said it had 'no record' that HMRC told ministers about apparent HSBC involvement in 'wrong-doing relating to its Swiss banking arm'. Martin Wheatley, chief executive of the City watchdog, the Financial Conduct Authority, told the Treasury select committee that HMRC had not passed on details of the allegations before they appeared in the media. HMRC chief executive Mrs Homer said the data was given to the tax authority under conditions which stopped it from sharing the information.","HMRC given dossier before former HSBC chief Stephen Green brought in .

"Photographs of women working under a strict regime in a hijab factory feared to be run by terror group Isis have emerged on a new blog post. The images show women decked in black from head to toe tailoring and stitching hijabs, while children play around them. Under the title 'The name of God and merciful', the blog was posted by the ‘Information Office of the Mandate of Nineveh’ - the same organisation which distributed pictures of public executions carried out by the militant organisation. Scroll down for video . Worker: A woman is covered from head to toe in black as she stitches hijabs in the factory . Innocent: Two young children smile for the camera as they try on hijabs and abayas within the factory. Normally in Islam only women who have reached puberty are expected to cover their bodies . It is understood that the factory is based in the Nineveh Province in northern Iraq, which has been subject to attacks from the terrorist group ISIS. Captions in the pictures, written in Arabic, describe the 'shaping and tailoring of Islamic veils in one of the Islamic State factories'. Later, they describe 'Preparing Islamic veils for distribution to Muslims'. Package: The unidentifiable women put the hijabs in plastic bags ready for distribution. Under Sharia law women must wear a hijab, niqab, a cloak and gloves to cover every part of their body . Inside: A montage of images from inside a hijab factory, believed to be run by terror group Isis . Since it was uploaded on January 30, the latest blog has attracted more than 10,000 hits worldwide and been shared on social media sites. The workers are pictured at work stations using black cloth to stitching together hijabs, the Islamic dress for women which covers the head and chest to protect their modesty. The garments are stacked high on tables and wrapped in plastic bags, ready for distribution, . In one of the pictures, a young boy can be seen excitedly shouting as the women around him continue to work. Play: A young boy gestures excitedly while rows of women stitch the hijabs, to be handed out to others to cover their heads and chests . Work: Women and their children form a queue as two men hand them bags . Piled high: A picture of the black garments in bag outside the factory were posted on the website . In separate images, the women are seen queuing outside the doors of the warehouse with children, as men hand them more black clothing. In Arabic, a title at the top of the webpage reads: ‘Illustrated report on sewing and distribution of legitimate veil on Muslim women’. As Isis has taken over swathes of territory across Iraq and Syria it has imposed Sharia law on citizens, which insists women must be fully clothed wearing hijabs, a niqab to cover their faces, gloves and an abaya, or cloak. The precise location of the factory is not known, but Nineveh was an ancient Mesopotamian city whose ruins now lie across the northern Iraqi city of Mosul. Pile: Hijabs are stacked outside the building for women to distribute . Hijabs: The clothing is designed to protect the modesty of women, but is viewed by critics as a method of control . The city is now controlled by Isis after the group attacked stormed through in June 2014, as part of their campaign to create a new Islamic State. An earlier post by the Information Office of the Mandate of Nineveh showed photographs of a series of public executions by Isis terrorists. They included men accused of being gay being thrown off high towers, a woman accused of adultery being stoned to death and others being crucified after being sentenced for ‘banditry’. The International Business Times reported in January how Isis militants were believed to have executed five men, because their wives were not wearing hijabs properly.

"Astronomers have witnessed the creation of a multiple star system for the first time, which may one day resemble the solar system of Luke Skywalker's home planet, Tatooine, in the film Star Wars. Incredible images taken from a series of telescopes on Earth show clouds of gas in the process of developing into stars. The pictures are providing new insight into how systems with more than one star, and even our own solar system, are formed. Astronomers have witnessed the creation of a multiple star system for the first time. This close-up image, taken using a series of telescopes on Earth, focuses on the region forming the stars . A team of international scientists, including researchers from The University of Manchester and Liverpool John Moores University (LJMU), looked at a cloud of gas approximately 800 light-years from Earth. They focused on a core of gas that contains one young protostar and three dense pockets of matter that they say will collapse into stars over the next 40,000 years. Of the eventual four stars, the astronomers predict that three may become a stable triple-star system, according to the study published in the journal Nature. The amazing images show clouds of gas in the process of developing into stars. This is a large scale Herschel image of the dust in the region in blue, with the dense gas low-resolution image in green, and the dense gas high-resolution image displaying filaments in red . Seeing a multiple star system in its early stages of formation has been a longstanding challenge. Astronomers used a combination of the Very Large Array (VLA) and the Green Bank Telescope (GBT) to make it possible, at last, to look at such a young system. They also used the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope (JCMT), in Hawaii, to study a dense core of gas called Barnard 5 (B5) in a region where young stars are forming in the constellation Perseus. ‘These kind of multi-star systems are quite common in the universe,’ said Professor Gary Fuller, of the Jodrell Bank Centre for Astrophysics at The University of Manchester. 'Think of Tatooine in Star Wars, where there are two 'suns' in the sky. That isn’t too far away from something that could be a real formation. ‘In fact nearly half of all stars are in this type of system.’ He explained that seeing a multiple star system in its early stages of formation has been a longstanding challenge, but the combination of the Very Large Array (VLA) and the Green Bank Telescope (GBT) has made it possible at last to look at such a young system. Dr Richard Parker, of the Astrophysics Research Institute at LJMU, performed the stability analysis calculations on the system. He said: ‘Observing the formation and subsequent destruction of these systems will ultimately help us to understand whether our own sun was once part of such a system and if it was, what happened to its stellar siblings.’ Of the eventual four stars, the astronomers predict that three may become a stable triple-star system. An artist's  impression on the left shows  the star and three dense gas condensations system, while the right panel shows the system after the stars are formed out of the condensations. The scientists used the VLA and GBT, along with the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope (JCMT) in Hawaii, to study a dense core of gas called Barnard 5 (B5) in a region where young stars are forming in the constellation Perseus. This object was known to contain one young forming star. When the research team used the VLA to map radio emission from ammonia molecules, they discovered that filaments of gas in B5 are fragmenting, and the fragments are beginning to contract to form additional stars - ultimately becoming a multiple-star system. Project leader Jaime Pineda, of the Institute for Astronomy, ETH Zurich, in Switzerland, said: ‘We know that these stars eventually will form a multi-star system because our observations show that these gas condensations are gravitationally bound. ‘This is the first time we've been able to show that such a young system is gravitationally bound. ‘This provides fantastic evidence that fragmentation of gas filaments is a process that can produce multiple-star systems.’ ‘Multi-star systems are quite common in the universe,’ said Professor Gary Fuller, of the Jodrell Bank Centre for Astrophysics at The University of Manchester. 'Think of Tatooine in Star Wars, where there are two “suns” in the sky [pictured]. That isn’t too far away from something that could be a real formation' The pictures are providing new insight into how systems with more than one star, and even our own solar system, are formed. A simulation of the creation of the multi-star system is shown . Astronomers have previously said that mechanisms responsible for creating multiple star systems, include fragmentation of the main gas core of the star, fragmentation within a disk of material orbiting a young star and gravitational capture by one star of another. ‘We've now convincingly added fragmentation of gas filaments to this list,’ Dr Pineda added. The condensations in B5 that will produce stars now range from one-tenth to more than one-third the mass of our sun, the scientists said. Their separations will range from 3,000 to 11,000 times the Earth-sun distance. The astronomers analysed the dynamics of the gas condensations and predict that when they form into stars, they will form a stable system of an inner binary. They predict that the other two stars will be ejected from the system.","Astronomers captured creation of a multiple star system for the first time .

"If you've ever bitten into deep fried ice cream, you might have experienced a taste and texture that was out of this world - in more ways than one. That's because, according to Nasa, the structure of Comet 67P - which Esa's Rosetta spacecraft is currently orbiting - resembles the popular dessert. In an experiment, they found that while the exterior of a comet is encased in a hard, outer crust, the interior would mostly be fluffy ice. Nasa scientists in California say comets are like deep fried ice cream. The analogy was made after an experiment on Earth called Himalaya looked at how comets evolve over time. It suggests they have a hard exterior but a soft and fluffy interior. Shown is a mosaic of comet 67P taken by Rosetta on 3 February 2015 . 'A comet is like deep fried ice cream,' said Dr Murthy Gudipati of Nasa's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, corresponding author of a recent study appearing in the Journal of Physical Chemistry. 'The crust is made of crystalline ice, while the interior is colder and more porous. 'The organics are like a final layer of chocolate on top.' Esa's Rosetta spacecraft launched on 2 March 2004 aboard an Ariane 5 rocket, on a mission to visit comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko. It took more than ten years to reach the comet, and on the way it flew past Mars and two asteroids. On 6 August 2014 it entered orbit around the comet, beginning a series of complex manoeuvres to get the best views possible. On 12 November 2014 Rosetta successfully released a smaller vehicle it had carried called Philae. This small probe bounced twice on the surface before coming to rest. Although Philae's landing did not go as planned, it was still able to complete more than 90 per cent of the science it was intended to do before its main batteries died, sending the probe to sleep. The location of the lander is currently unknown. It is thought to be in partial shadow near a cliff but, as the comet approaches the sun, the additional light may charge its solar panels enough for the lander to wake up. Rosetta, meanwhile, is continuing its mission around the comet. 67P is approaching the sun and, by August this year, it is thought its activity will have dramatically increased. This will release much more ice, vapour and other materials from the surface - and Rosetta will be there to watch it all happen. To come to the conclusion, astronomers used an icebox-like instrument nicknamed Himalaya. They showed that fluffy ice on the surface of a comet would crystallise and harden as the comet heads towards the sun and warms up. While researchers had already known that comets had soft interiors and hard crusts, based on data from Rosetta, their exact composition and how they formed had remained unclear. In this study, the researchers used labs on Earth to model how a comet's crust crystallised. The experiments began with amorphous, or porous, ice - the proposed composition of the coldest comets and icy moons. In this state, water vapour molecules are flash-frozen at extremely cold temperatures of around 30 Kelvin (-243°C or -405°F). This preserves disorderly states in the comet, so water molecules are mixed with other molecules, like organics, and remain frozen. According to Dr Gudipati, amorphous ice is like cotton candy - light and fluffy, and filled with pockets of space. The researchers then used the Himalaya cryostat instrument to slowly warm their amorphous ice mixtures from 30 Kelvin to 150 Kelvin. This mimicked the conditions a comet would experience as it journeys towards the sun. The ice was also infused with a type of organics, called polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, or PAHs, which are common in space, to mimic the composition of the comet. To come to the conclusion that comets are like deep fried ice cream (stock image left), astronomers used an icebox-like instrument nicknamed Himalaya (right). They showed that fluffy ice on the surface of a comet would crystallise and harden as the comet heads towards the sun and warms up . While researchers had already known that comets had soft interiors and hard crusts, based on data from Rosetta, their exact composition and how they formed had remained unclear. Shown is a mosaic of comet 67P taken by Rosetta on 31 January 2015, with jets of vapour being expelled from the surface . How did water come to exist on our planet? Most scientists are of the opinion that it didn't begin here on Earth, instead being transported from elsewhere in the solar system, but whether it came from an asteroid or a comet was a mystery. That was one of the key questions Esa was hoping the Rosetta mission would solve when it arrived at comet 67P in August, and it mayn now have an answer. Using the Rosetta Orbiter Spectrometer for Ion and Neutral Analysis - or Rosina - the spacecraft 'sniffed' the comet's atmosphere as it remained in orbit and analysed its composition. It found that water in the comet's atmosphere had a different ratio of deuterium-to-hydrogen than water on Earth. The results were seemingly confirmed by the Philae lander on the surface. However, some scientists have pointed out that not all comets are the same - and others may match the water on Earth. The debate over whether asteroids or comets brought water to Earth - or even both - looks set to continue for the foreseeable future. The results came as a surprise. 'The PAHs stuck together and were expelled from the ice host as it crystallised,' said Dr Antti Lignell of Caltech. 'This may be the first observation of molecules clustering together due to a phase transition of ice, and this certainly has many important consequences for the chemistry and physics of ice.' With PAHs kicked out of the ice mixtures, the water molecules had room to link up and form the more tightly packed structures of crystalline ice. 'What we saw in the lab - a crystalline comet crust with organics on top - matches what has been suggested from observations in space,' said Dr Gudipati. 'Deep fried ice cream is really the perfect analogy, because the interior of the comets should still be very cold and contain the more porous, amorphous ice.' The composition of comets is important to understanding how they might have delivered water and organics to the young, hot Earth. New results from the Rosetta mission show that asteroids may have been the primary carriers of life's ingredients; however, the debate is ongoing and comets may have played a role. For Dr Gudipati, comets are capsules containing clues not only to our planet's history but to the birth of our entire solar system. 'It's beautiful to think about how far we have come in our understanding of comets. Future missions designed to bring cold samples of comets back to Earth could allow us to fully unravel their secrets,' he said.","Nasa scientists in California say comets are like deep fried ice cream .

"A 33-year-old beautician from Essex knows a thing or two about regret after having 'Mummy' tattooed in large letters on her neck to impress her friends. Mother-of-two Angela got the inking as a teenager because the boys and girls she was hanging around with at the time all had tattoos on their necks. When Angela's mother found out about her plans, she banned her from the tattoo parlour, but the rebellious teen went away anyway... but chose the word 'Mummy' as a sweetener. Angela, 33, from Essex, had 'Mummy' tattooed on her neck as a teen and now regrets it as she looks like a bad mother . Almost instantly, she heavily regretted her decision, and now five years on she is desperate to get the permanent design removed. She told Channel 4 show Bodyshockers: 'Within hours I regretted it. I tried to convince myself that I wanted to keep it but I knew straight away it had to go. 'I was rebellious as a teenager, I was hanging around with people at the time who had neck tattoos so I thought they were ok. 'My mum said at the time said I couldn't get one so I had the word 'mummy' etched on so she then she couldn't tell me off.' Angela with her mother, who advised against getting the tattoo . Since getting the tattoo, Angela has had two children, which has only furthered her desire to get the inking removed. She said: 'At school, I try to cover it up but I don't feel like I don't look like a responsible parent. 'I have actually avoided going into the school playground before because my hair is up . 'I feel like I look like my children's teenage sister who is still trying to rebel in life.' Despite the enormous embarrassment that having the tattoo causes Angela, she has been reluctant to undergo the laser treatment that would help to get rid of it. But the sharp pain from the lasers isn't preventing her - it is the fact that she can't have continue to use sunbeds while she has treatment. She said: 'I know it sounds stupid, but the fact that I can't have a sunbed is a big thing to me. 'I'm going to be stressed and upset about that because I'm going out and I have no tan. 'You can't even use fake tan - what am I going to do? It's bad.' Angela getting the tattoo removed . After giving her dilemma some serious consideration, Angela decides to go through with the treatments and ditch her sunbeds. The cameras follow her as she visits a salon for the first of her treatments. After the session has finished, she tells the TV producers: 'That's really painful, it's like someone is hitting you with a flame that is electrocuting you at the same time.

"Alberto Nisman (pictured) was discovered dead in his own apartment in January - a day before he was due to testify about his claims . An Argentine prosecutor's mysterious death days after he made criminal charges against President Cristina Fernandez is part of an attempt to unseat her and bring neoliberals back to power, a senior government official has claimed. Gustavo Lopez, an undersecretary in the presidency, said Alberto Nisman's death last month was part of a coup. He wrote in a statement: 'We are facing an attempted coup d'etat, that aims to get rid of the president, to end this political project that has been governing since 2003 and to restore the neoliberal conservative forces that governed for decades to reap their own benefits.' Lopez said the government of Fernandez and her late husband and predecessor Nestor Kirchner had confronted many sinister forces during their years in power such as the 'international economic interests that live from usury, weapons trafficking and money laundering.' He said: 'Now they have come to get their revenge. They cannot stand the Front for Victory (ruling coalition) winning another presidential period and if they need to provoke a political death to achieve this, they will do it.' Nisman had accused President Cristina Fernandez of covering up Iran's alleged role in the 1994 bombing of a Jewish centre in Buenos Aires that left 85 dead. His body was discovered in an apartment - a day before he was due to testify about his claim that Fernandez sought to whitewash his findings that Iran was behind the attack on the centre, run by the Argentine Israelite Mutual Association. This week, Argentine investigators revealed they had found a second person's DNA in the apartment where Nisman was found dead. Following the find, Judge Fabiana Palmaghini is calling in a person who visited Nisman the day before his body was found. The judge's office does not name the witness, but Nisman's aide Diego Lagomarsino has acknowledged visiting him on January 17. Investigators say they don't yet know if Nisman committed suicide or was killed. Last week, it was reported that investigators are trying to track down former intelligence chief Antonio Stiusso in connection with Nisman's death, but are unsure if he is even in the country. 'He was not at any of the properties registered as his own,' Oscar Parrilli, head of the Intelligence Secretariat (SI), told . reporters. Iran has vigorously denied involvement in the bombing and . Fernandez has dismissed Nisman's findings as absurd. She said . Nisman was duped by rogue agents involved in a power struggle . and killed when he was no longer of value to them. One of those spies was Stiusso, Fernandez's government has . said. Fired during a December shake-up of the SI, Stiusso had . helped Nisman with his investigation of the bombing. 'I have no doubts that Stiusso is behind all this, after the . decision of (President Fernandez) to fire him from the SIDE,' Anibal Fernandez, the president's chief of staff, said on . Twitter on Tuesday, referring to the top spy agency by its . former name. Alberto Nisman had accused President Cristina Fernandez (pictured) of covering up Iran's alleged role in the 1994 bombing of a Jewish centre in Buenes Aires that left 85 dead . Officials in Argentina were unable to locate ex-counter intelligence boss Antonio Stiusso (pictured) at three different addresses held in his name - and are unsure if he is even in the country . Thee 1994 bombing of a Buenes Aires Jewish centre, run by the Argentine Israelite Mutual Association,  left 85 dead . Parrilli said secrecy laws would be lifted so thatinvestigators could grill Stiusso fully about the mysteriousevents leading up to Nisman's death. He said the presidentwanted 'the whole truth to be known.' Stiusso's spy career spanned four decades. He was one of the . most feared men in the intelligence agency, which played an . important role in the military government's 'dirty war' against . suspected Marxist rebels, union leaders and other leftists in . the 1970s. Since democracy was restored in 1983, successive governments . are widely believed to have continued to use the agency to snoop . on opponents. Stiusso, whose name is often spelled Stiuso in . Argentina, is believed to have been at the heart of its . wiretapping operations. '(Stiusso) is a key man given his ties to Alberto Nisman,' Gerardo Young, author of a book titled 'The Secret Argentina' on . the intelligence community, told television channel TN. 'He knew . perfectly what Nisman had been working on and surely knew of his . state of mind.' It remains unclear whether Nisman killed himself or was . murdered. No arrests have been made since Fernandez's remark two weeks . ago that renegade spies were behind the prosecutor's death. The scandal has dented the government's credibility ahead of . October's presidential election, polls show. Fernandez is barred . from running for a third term.","Official claims Alberto Nisman's death part of 'coup d'etat'

Originally from Tuscany, the black leafy veg is now grown in the UK too and farmers are calling for a name change to 'Black Kale' to help bump up its popularity to superfood superhero. It tastes a little sweeter but is still a good source of lutein, vitamins K, A and C as well as significant amounts of manganese, copper, fibre, calcium, iron and the B vitamins. Kale website Discover Kale (yes, this exists, and it's actually pretty good, um, if you're a kale fan) explains: . 'Cavolo nero is a close cousin to kale, which means it has the same nutritional profile and like its British counterpart, it is really versatile, easy to use and great value. From the research it seems though that the Italian name is sending the wrong message to our customers, who are confused as to what exactly cavolo nero is and are perhaps failing to appreciate that it is now grown in the UK. By renaming cavolo nero black kale, we are making it really clear that it shares the benefits of kale and we hope that this will encourage consumers to try this brilliant home-grown brassica.' OK then... time to stick it in a smoothie: . Prep time: 5 minutes . Serves 1 . Place all the ingredients in a blender or food processor and blitz until smooth. Or for a creamier drink try replacing the pineapple with banana and add some mint.","Cavolo nero was originally grown in Tuscany but has made its way here .

"For decades Waldo has eluded millions of children in the classic book series - and he’s likely frustrated a number of adults too. To make finding the bespectacled character easier, a Michigan-based computer scientist has devised a strategy using machine learning and algorithms. By plotting Waldo’s location across the series, Randal Olson created the path needed to travel around a typical page and find Waldo in the quickest way possible each time. Mr Olson used an algorithm to approximate the ‘optimal search path’ (pictured). He then divided the path into four sections, the first part is shown in blue, the second is orange, the third is green and the final section is shown in red. This path represents one of the shortest possible paths to follow on the page to find Waldo . The method built on a previous strategy by Ben Blatt from Slate magazine in November 2013. During this research, Mr Blatt plotted Waldo’s 68 locations across seven books. Mr Olson took these plots to create a so-called kernel density estimation. This established the probability of Waldo being found in certain parts of a page. From this, Mr Olson discovered that Waldo is rarely located in the top left-hand corner, or along the edges, to account for the box that typically described the setting and for printing inconsistencies. Waldo was also never found on the bottom of the right-hand page. Next, Mr Olson used what is known as the ‘travelling salesman problem’ to check every possible Wally location in the shortest time possible, with the least repetition. By following this method, Mr Olson was able to ‘zoom through most illustrations’ (example pictured) in less than 10 seconds. He also discovered that on at least four occasions, book one in particular had instances or ‘outliers’ in which the strategy didn't work . ‘In computer terms, that means we’re making a list of all 68 points that Waldo could be at, then sorting them based on the order that we’re going to visit them,’ explained Mr Olson on his blog. ‘Those 68 points can be arranged in ~2.48 x 1096 possible ways. To provide some context, that’s more possible arrangements than the number of atoms in the universe.’ Due to the complexity of the task, Mr Olson used machine learning to approximate the ‘optimal search path’ based on an algorithm. To make finding Waldo - known as Wally in the UK - easier, a  computer scientist plotted all of the character's 68 locations across seven of the classic books (pictured). The method built on a previous strategy created by Ben Blatt from Slate magazine in November 2013 .

Randal Olson used an algorithm to plot the shortest path required to find Waldo. But, Mr Olson acknowledged that humans are unable to remember a path as easily as a computer and revealed tips to make the process easier. Waldo is rarely located in the top left-hand corner, or along the edges, for example. He is also rarely found on the bottom of the right-hand page. Start on the bottom half of the left-hand page.If Waldo isn’t on the bottom half of the left page, 'then he’s probably not on the left page at all'. The upper quarter of the right page is the next best place to look and Mr Olson said 'Waldo seems to prefer to hide on the upper quarter of the right page.' Next check the bottom right half of the right page. Mr Olson added Waldo has an aversion to the bottom left half of the right page and searchers shouldn't bother looking there until they're exhausted the other hot spots. He ran this algorithm for five minutes and created a solution that divided the path into four sections: the first part is shown in blue, the second is orange, the third is green and the final section is shown in red. ‘This path represents one of the shortest possible paths to follow on the page to find Waldo,’ continued Mr Olson. ‘So if we followed this path exactly, we’d most likely find Waldo much faster than someone following a more basic technique.’ But, Mr Olson acknowledged that humans are unable to remember a path as easily as a computer and revealed tips to make the process easier.

"A father who bit into his McDonald's burger to find it was completely raw has vowed to never return to the chain. Byron Thomas, from Northampton,  ordered the quarter pounder with cheese meal for £4.69 on Monday evening, and took it back to his car. But when the 28-year-old eagerly tucked into his dinner, he noticed a strange taste after he had his first bite. Scroll down for video . Byron Thomas from Weston Favell, Northamptonshire, with a raw quarter pounder that he bought from McDonalds . He said he was sickened when he saw that apart from the light brown top layer, the rest of the meal was red raw. The father-of-two went back in to the branch at the Weston Favell Shopping Centre in Northampton to complain - but said the manager only offered to cook him another burger. He then claims he was up from 4am on Tuesday being sick. Mr Thomas, who lives with his partner Gail Mooney, 36, vowed never to eat there again. He fumed: 'I was getting a bit of tea with my stepdaughter and I was in the car when I bit into it and thought it looked strange. 'Then I looked down and the outside was light brown but the rest of it inside was pure raw.

The father-of-two went back in to the branch at the Weston Favell Shopping Centre in Northampton to complain - but said the manager only offered to cook him another burger . 'I spat out what was in my mouth straight away, it was absolutely disgusting. 'I was up being sick at 4am the next morning and I am still being ill on and off now. 'I have Ulcerative Colitis so it doesn't help my stomach when I am eating completely raw meat. 'We only pop to McDonald's for a treat every now and then but there is no way me or any of my friends or family will ever be going there again.' Byron, who works as a health and safety trainer on the railways, refused to give the raw burger back to the manager at the McDonald's branch. He is now planning on contacting his local environmental health officer to make an official complaint. Mr Thomas, who has two sons Kenzie, three, and Kyson, six, and two stepdaughters Katie, 13, and Karley, 16, has also contacted McDonalds' head office. Mr Thomas claims he was up all night being sick after eating the burger. Mr Thomas, who lives with his partner Gail Mooney, 36, vowed never to eat at McDonald's again . He added: 'I went straight back in there but the manager didn't look too bothered. 'He just said 'sorry I'll cook you another burger'. 'But I refused to eat that and refused to give him the raw burger because he wanted to take it away. 'There were about 10 customers in the queue who just walked out when I showed them how disgusting it was. 'They couldn't give me a refund because they had already messed up my order three times and given me my money back for that. A McDonald's spokesman said: 'Food safety is our highest priority. We place great emphasis on quality control and follow rigorous standards in order to avoid any imperfections in our food. 'We are disappointed to hear of this experience and as soon as we were made aware of the incident, we launched a full investigation. We will be in touch with Mr Thomas once this is complete.' It is not the first time the fast-food chain has served less than savoury meals to customers. Sue Bennett, 43, of Rotherham, choked in disgust as she took the top of the bun off the burger to remove the gherkins - only to discover one of the meat patties was pink and uncooked so she took it to the manageress, who tested it with a temperature probe. It gave a reading of 39 degrees C - nearly half the minimum temperature for cooking the burger. And Gizela Tahuri, a diner at a restaurant in Brisbane, Australia, was horrified to discover that her chicken McWrap was full of completely raw meat.","Byron Thomas ordered a quarter pounder with cheese meal for £4.69 .

"It is a controversial illness that many believe to be a malady of the mind. But chronic fatigue syndrome is a 'real and serious disease' that needs proper diagnosis, doctors have said. As a result, the condition needs a new name - and there should be a straightforward way to diagnose it, they added. The comments came from the Institute of Medicine, a prestigious government advisory group in the U.S. Scroll down for video . Chronic fatigue isn't all in the mind, a panel of leading US medical experts has declared. It has now set out five main symptoms as simple criteria for doctors to use in making a diagnosis . The federal government asked the independent organisation to investigate the state of chronic fatigue diagnosis after it was flooded with stories by patients who were misdiagnosed or even dismissed by sceptical doctors. Yesterday, the IOM panel sought to redefine chronic fatigue syndrome, setting five main symptoms as simple criteria for doctors to use in making a diagnosis. Experts also called for a new name for the condition, because many patients feel the term 'chronic fatigue' belittles their suffering. Instead, they argue it should be called Systemic Exertion Intolerance Disease, or SEID, to reflect that symptoms worsen after exertion. Chronic fatigue syndrome is also know as ME. Chronic fatigue syndrome is also know as ME. The condition affects between one and four million people in the US and millions more worldwide - and the combination of symptoms can devastate a patient's life for decades. Jose Montoya, a professor of medicine at Stanford University and a leading expert in CFS, has previously described the condition as 'one of the greatest scientific and medical challenges of our time'. He said: 'Its symptoms often include not only overwhelming fatigue but also: . Joint and muscle pain . Incapacitating headaches . Food intolerance . Sore throat/enlarged lymph nodes . Gastrointestinal problems . Abnormal blood-pressure and heart-rate events . Hypersensitivity to light, noise or other sensations . The condition affects between one and four million in the US and millions more worldwide - and the combination of symptoms can devastate a patient's life for decades. Its hallmark is persistent and profound fatigue where, on a bad day, a simple activity like grocery shopping can put someone to bed. It is often accompanied by memory problems or other symptoms. These include joint and muscle pain, incapacitating headaches, food intolerance, a sore throat or enlarged lymph nodes and sensitivity to light. However there is no specific treatment and the IOM found less than a third of medical schools teach about the disease. 'Chronic fatigue is not a figment of patients' imagination,' said Dr Ellen Wright Clayton of Vanderbilt University's Center for Biomedical Ethics and Society, who chaired the IOM panel. 'These patients have real symptoms. They deserve real care. 'It is not appropriate to dismiss these patients by saying, ""I am chronically fatigued, too"".' She added: 'People shouldn't wander around in the wilderness for years trying to get a diagnosis.' The hallmark of the condition is where fatigue is persistent and profound fatigue where, on a bad day, a simple activity like grocery shopping can put someone to bed . Under the new proposals from the IOM, diagnosing chronic fatigue would require three core symptoms: . These are: . * Fatigue and a reduction in activity that lasts for more than six months . * Fatigue that gets worse after exertion . * Sleep that is unrefreshing despite exhaustion . Patients must also have at least one other symptom of the following: . * Cognitive impairment, sometimes described as 'brain fog' * What's called orthostatic intolerance - meaning symptoms improve when lying down and patients find it hard to stay upright for long. Dr Lucinda Bateman, of the Fatigue Consultation Clinic in Salt Lake City, said: 'We are hoping that these diagnostic criteria provide a very clear path,' she said. 'It's a fresh start.' There are ways to treat some of the symptoms, if doctors make a diagnosis, said added. To spread the word, committee members are writing about the diagnostic criteria in several medical journals, and the institute's web site, www.iom.edu, will eventually post a guide for doctors. Patients have long sought a change to a name they say belittles their suffering. Some groups already had begun using another term -  myalgic encephalomyelitis, or ME. The new report rejected that option, saying not all patients have the muscle pain and brain or spinal cord inflammation that medical jargon reflects. 'This is a defining moment for the disease,' said Carol Head of the Solve ME/CFS Initiative, the largest advocacy organisation for the condition in the US. Beyond improving diagnosis, the government-funded report should spur more research to understand and treat the disease, she said. It's too soon to know if the new name will catch on, but including the word 'disease' instead of 'syndrome' is an improvement, Head added. 'Having called this serious disease by an inappropriate and frankly insulting name is one of the factors that kept doctors, friends, family members, even employers from affording it the seriousness it deserves,' she said. The recommendations mark 'a critical step toward assisting medical providers in making a diagnosis for those with this serious and debilitating illness,' said Dr Nancy Lee, of the HHS Office on Women's Health. She added the government would review the recommendations. Last year Stanford University researchers revealed the brains of those diagnosed with chronic fatigue syndrome are distinctly different to those of healthy people. First, an MRI scan showed that overall white matter content of CFS patients' brains was reduced compared to that of healthy participants' brains. The term 'white matter' denotes the long, cable-like nerve tracts carrying signals and information through dispersed concentrations of 'grey matter' - which specialise in processing information. The researchers said while the first finding wasn't entirely unexpected, the second was. Using advanced imaging techniques, they identified a consistent abnormality in a particular part of a nerve tract in the right hemisphere of CFS patients' brains. The tract, which connects the frontal lobe with the temporal lobe, assumed an abnormal appearance in CFS patients. Furthermore, the study identified a strong link between the degree of abnormality in the patient's tract and the severity of their CFS. The third finding highlighted a thickening of the grey matter in the frontal lobe and temporal lobe in CFS patients, compared with the control group .","Comments came from US government advisory group Institute of Medicine .

"The family of an airman who crashed during World War Two finally found the site where he met his death, only to discover it is to be cleared and turned into a housing estate without allowing experts to search for bodies or the wreckage of the plane. Flight engineer Ronald Barton, 34, and his seven comrades were flying their final mission over Germany in 1944 when they crashed while on their way home. The precise location of the crash site near the town of Cloppenburg, in northern Germany was lost after the war and was only found recently after a lengthy search by Mr Barton's surviving relatives and by making contact with people who lived nearby as children. Debbie Bartlett (left) searched with her sister Julie Barton to track down the exact crash site where their grandfather died after his Lancaster bomber crashed during World War Two. The sisters found the site by speaking to people who lived nearby, such as Herr Heuerman (right) and left roses for the airmen who died . However, when Mr Barton's family finally located the field farmer's field in the village of Staatsforten, near Varrelbusch, they found parts of the land had already been cleared to make way for a housing estate. They met people who had lived near to the crash site who remain convinced that bodies and discarded parts of the plane are still in the ground. The land is due to be dug up with mechanical diggers next Monday - without allowing archaeologists the opportunity to search for bodies and parts of the wreckage. Julie Barton, 52, and her younger sister Debbie Bartlett, 48, spent more than 18 months tirelessly tracking down the precise site where their grandfather died. Flight engineer Ronald Barton perished in the crash . The Royal Australian Air Force helped the sisters track down the site, along with aviation archaeologists who spoke to people who had lived in the area at the time of the crash. The sisters visited the field last week, laying eight roses for the airmen who died there. They also met people who had seen the burning wreckage of the Lancaster bomber set fire to their neighbouring farm when they were children. The bodies of two Bomber Command airmen were recovered from the plane by German soldiers after the crash but the six others who perished are still believed to be in the ground, along with the wreckage. Ms Barton said: 'The eye witnesses we met are convinced there are still people in the ground and lots of the plane. 'The German authorities have an ordnance team going in to check there are no unexploded bombs in the ground and then they are sending in bulldozers to tear up the ground. 'We are very anxious to trace family members of the rest of the crew so that we can urge the Germans to treat the site with sensitivity and ensure that it is examined carefully for any remains of the lost crew members including our grandfather. 'We have had limited help or encouragement from the British authorities, and we feel time is running out to ensure that the excavation is carefully undertaken and that local archaeologists are fully involved.' The sisters said they wanted any remains to receive a fitting burial and any parts of the plane found to be displayed in a museum. Their grandfather left behind a 10-year-old son when he died. The crash site in a remote field in Germany has already started to be cleared to make way for housing . The site of the accident is pictured just days after the crash, but details of its location was soon lost . Days after the accident people are pictured searching the wreckage after eight airmen died in the crash . On October 6, 1944, Lancaster PD214 set off from RAF Metheringham in Lincolnshire on what was meant to be the crew's last operational mission - a bombing raid on the German industrial city of Bremen. But the plane lost contact with the base and it was eventually recorded as missing. The International Red Cross reported that the plane had crashed and that the Germans had recovered two bodies. In 1946 an RAF investigation team exhumed the two bodies and identified them as Australian Trainee Pilot Flight Lieutenant John Colclough Barlow, 35, and Rear Gunner Sergeant Ronald James Paul, 20. Debbie Bartlett (left) met eyewitness Heinz Heuermann (second left) and Herr Broening (second right), whose mother identified the crew to investigators in 1946, along with Julie Barton (right) at the crater in Germany . The crash site today looks very different from when the plane crashed and exploded during World War Two . They are both buried in Becklingen War Cemetery. The other six men who were on board that night were all listed as having 'no known grave' and are remembered at the RAF memorial in Runnymede. Ms Barton, from Beddau, South Wales, said: 'It was their 30th and final bombing mission as a crew. As far as we know they dropped their bombs and were on their way home when they crashed. 'Eye witnesses at the crash site said they could hear the bombing from their farm 40 miles away and then it went quiet. 'Then they heard this odd engine noise and in the pitch black a bomber suddenly dropped out of nowhere and exploded - creating four large burning craters. Ronald Barton (top right) left a 10-year-old son behind after he died and was listed missing after the crash . A telegram sent in 1944 informs Mrs Barton that her husband was missing in action after the final mission . Mr Barton's wife was sent a letter in 1945 telling her that her husband was still being classified as 'missing' 'Children nearby came and played on the site in the days after. 'They found an embroidered handkerchief with Barlow stitched on it and a flying boot with my grandfather's name on it.' Pilot Flt Lt Douglas Stewart, 29; Navigator Flt Sgt George Bowering Kirby, 22; Wireless Operator Gordon Stuart Grogan; Canadian Bomb Aimer Pilot Officer Clyde James Royal, 31; and Mid Upper Gunner Flt. Sgt James Anthony Fell, 21, were the missing men. The sisters said they had been able to track down the site thanks to the help of the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF). Some parts of the plane were recovered from the crash site, but residents believe there is more to be found . Trainee Pilot Flight Lieutenant John Colclough Barlow, 35, and Rear Gunner Sergeant Ronald James Paul, 20, were recovered by the Germans after they died and were buried in Becklingen War Cemetery . Mr Barton and his colleagues were remembered on a war memorial in Swansea after the plane crash . She said: 'An RAF investigation team went to village in 1946 and were shown where the two recovered bodies were buried and identified them a crew members. 'There were eight men aboard that night because they had an Australian trainee pilot with them. 'Luckily, because there was an Australian aboard we could get lots of information from the RAAF about the crash report which the RAF wouldn't give us because of data sensitivity about other crew members. 'But even with the crash report we lacked an exact position for the crash.'","Ronald Barton was one of eight airmen who died in a crash during WWII .

"Free wi-fi access will be available to rail passengers across England and Wales within two years, David Cameron announced yesterday. He said it was 'vital' that commuters could work online while travelling after warnings that too many operators are 'stuck in the analogue age'. A major extension of on-board wireless internet connections is set to be rolled out to most lines by 2017. Whitehall will release £50million towards the cost of the project – with the money coming from the huge fine paid by rail bosses for delays to services. Prime Minister David Cameron, working on a train last week, said it was 'vital' for people to be able to get online while travelling . The cash will benefit travellers with operators that offer either no or limited wi-fi including Thameslink, Southern and Great Northern, Southeastern, Chiltern and Arriva Trains Wales. Firms that do offer wi-fi but charge for it will have to set out how they would provide the service for free when they renew franchises – a move that could save commuters up to £360 a year. Rail minister Claire Perry said yesterday: 'Free wi-fi is a priority for many as being able to keep up with work, connect with friends or even check the latest journey information online helps make rail travel more productive.' Mr Cameron announced the proposals after being asked by MP Maria Miller at Prime Minister's Questions what he would do for commuters 'increasingly frustrated that our trains are stuck in the analogue age' with internet access 'difficult and very limited'. The Prime Minister said: 'It is vital for businesses and for individuals to be able to access wi-fi, do their work and make other contacts while they are on trains. 'I am pleased to announce plans that will see the rollout of free Wi-Fi on trains across the UK from 2017.' He said: 'The Government will invest nearly £50 million to ensure that rail passengers are better connected. 'Passengers that make over 500 million journeys every year with the four rail operators, TSGN, Southeastern, Chiltern, Arriva Trains Wales, will all benefit from this investment.' Chiltern trains are among those set to benefit from the investment announced today . Mr Cameron made the announcement in response to a question from former culture secretary Maria Miller, who said passengers were 'increasingly frustrated our trains are stuck in the analogue age'. Of the operators that provide the service, East Coast trains offers 15 minutes for free, and then charges £4.95 an hour or £9.95 for 24 hours. East Midlands Trains charges £4 a journey or £300 a year for regular commuters. Virgin Trains charges £4 an hour, or up to £30 a month – equal to £360 for a year. Under the new plans, the 20 per cent of services with wi-fi will rise to about 70 per cent by 2017. The cost will come from the £53.1million fine that the Office for Rail Regulation ordered Network Rail to pay last year for missing punctuality targets. Cash will go towards the track-side cables and transmitters needed to provide wi-fi. David Sidebottom, of the watchdog Passenger Focus, said: 'Passengers expect to be able to use free and reliable wi-fi... and they have told us that this is a top priority for improving their journey.' The Department for Transport said: 'Where there is no new franchise agreement due in the next two years, almost £50million of funding will be released from the Department for Transport to ensure Wi-Fi is available on selected services from 2017'. It added: 'Some operators have already installed equipment to provide improved mobile coverage on-board their trains, or are in the process of doing so. 'By targeting the investment at franchises that would otherwise have no immediate plans to introduce Wi-Fi, the government is ensuring that as many passengers as possible benefit.' Travellers on Thameslink, Southern and Great Northern, Southeastern, Chiltern and Arriva Trains Wales services should be able to access free wi-fi from 2017 . The £47.8million funding is money that Network Rail has been required to return to the government for missing punctuality targets set by the watchdog Office of Rail Regulation. It is the first time such money has been reinvested into improvements targeted at passengers, said the Department for Transport. But Manuel Cortes, leader of the TSSA rail union questioned why taxpayers' cash was being used to fund the wi-fi: 'You don't get the taxpayer funding free wi-fi in Starbucks or Costa Coffee. The rail companies should be paying for it out of their profits.' He added; At least passengers will be able to surf the net to find out why the train they are on is running late or overcrowded' Of the £53.1 million total penalty against Network Rail, some £5.3 million has been allocated to the Scottish Government, in line with the proportion of the penalty paid by Network Rail for late trains running in Scotland. Chief Secretary to the Treasury Danny Alexander said: 'As someone who regularly travels from the North of Scotland around the country, I appreciate the value of fast, cheap internet connections on trains for both leisure and business travellers. ' A spokesman for the Rail Delivery Group, which represents Network Rail and train operators, said: 'It is good news that even more rail passengers will be able to benefit from Wi-Fi on their train. 'Rail plays a crucial role in keeping people connected to friends, family and jobs and the wider rollout of Wi-Fi on the rail network will mean people can make even better use of their time on the train.'","Prime Minister announces £50million plan to invest in web access on trains .

"A rare signed photograph of Queen Victoria, a menu from the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge;s wedding breakfast and two cheques written by the Queen Mother are to go under the hammer. The items are part of an extraordinary collection of royal memorabilia spanning almost 200 years, all of which will go on sale next week. Historic letters and telegrams written and received by British royals, including the Queen, sepia photographs and elaborate menus from lavish royal dinners are also set to be auctioned off. Scroll down for video . Touching: This 1948 photo of the Queen and Prince Philip with Prince Charles was sent to the royal midwife . The collection, which also includes never-before-seen items belonging to the Duke and Duchess of Windsor, was amassed by Devonshire royal 'ephemera expert', Jim Hanson. 'Jim Hanson was an extraordinary collector,' explains auctioneer James Grinter, who will sell the collection at Reeman Dansie’s Royal memorabilia sale in Colchester on February 17th. 'He started from an early age collecting cheese labels, before moving on to marbles which he traded in the school playground. 'After giving up farming in Devon in the late 1970s he concentrated on travelling the world, trading and exhibiting stamps, and then turned his attention to royal memorabilia in his later years, before his death.' Although many of Mr Hanson's items are royal menus, it is the collection of telegrams that is likely to attract the most interest. One of the most touching is from a well-wisher to Sister Helen Rowe, the midwife who helped deliver all four of Her Majesty's children. Rare: A signed photo of Queen Victoria (left) and a picture of four-year-old Charles and two-year-old Anne . Delight: This telegram expressed delight at the news an heir, Prince Charles, had been born . Victoria at home: This photo, taken in the last years of her life, shows Queen Victoria with her pet dog . Record: This photo of the Queen Mother at her coronation accompanies letters to her dressmaker . An original Post Office telegram addressed to 'Sister Helen Rowe, Buckingham Palace, London' on November 14, 1948, the day Prince Charles was born, reads: 'Grand news. Please convey loyal congratulations. Billy.' It was accompanied by a photograph of the proud Queen and Prince Philip taken exactly a month later cradling the new-born heir to the throne at Buckingham Palace following his christening. Another lot likely to attract significant interest is a rare black and white portrait photograph of a relaxed Princess Diana, signed ‘Diana 1993’. Presented in a silver arched top presentation frame engraved with her crowned ‘D’ cipher, it is estimated to sell for between £3,000 and £3,500. There are also two handwritten letters Diana sent to her friend John Gairdner, a London Fashion Week producer, thanking him for sending her 'gorgeous flowers' to Highgrove and Kensington Palace on her birthdays in 1988 and 1990. The pair became friends after the fashion entrepreneur,  a director for designer shoemaker Charles Jourdan in the 1980s, styled himself Diana’s 'royal footman' after sending her a wedding trousseau of shoes. Also included in the auction is an original Order of Service, photos, invitations and menus for the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge’s wedding ceremony at Westminster Abbey in 2011. The wedding breakfast menu reveals their guests sat down to an elaborate starter of marinated South Uist salmon, Lyme Bay crab and wild Hebridean langoustines, served with a 2009 Meursault. For the main course, they were served Saddle of North Highland Mey select organic lamb, with Highgrove Spring vegetables, English asparagus, Jersey Royal potatoes and Sauce Windsor, accompanied by a 2004 Pomerol. And they finished with a trio of Berkshire honey ice cream, sherry trifle and chocolate parfait, washed down with Laurent Perrier Rose champagne and followed by coffee or fresh mint tea. Rare: These letters, written in the third person, contain instructions from the Queen Mother to her dressmaker . Tasty: An order of service for the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge's wedding and a menu for the breakfast . Rarer still is a signed photograph of Queen Victoria, showing her  with her sons and three future kings, King Edward VII, King George V, and King Edward VIII. An extremely rare menu from the dinner King Edward VIII held the night before he announced his abdication is also due to go under the hammer. Edward convened the crucial dinner at his Fort Belvedere home in Windsor Great Park for his closest royal advisers and Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin as he wrestled with his decision to abdicate in order to marry American divorcee Wallis Simpson. The menu, which bears the King’s ER cipher and is dated 8.12.1936, reveals they dined on Creme d’Epinards, Mousse de Sole Victoria, Filet de Boeuf and Souffle Alexander as they discussed the looming constitutional crisis. 'It is extraordinary to find a menu from such a crucial moment in the history of the British monarchy has survived - and in such excellent condition,' comments Grinter. A colour photograph of the Duke and Duchess of Windsor with four of their beloved pug dogs in the garden of their French country home is also included in the auction, as are photographs of the couple at their Paris town house in the Bois de Boulogne. Out and about: Queen Victoria with Princess Beatrice (left) and Prince George of Cambridge (right) in 1890 . Fascinating: The royal trio were at the Royal Military Exhibition on the 4th July 1890 . Handwritten: This photo of Diana accompanies letters she sent to her friend, fashion producer John Gairdner . One silver-edged menu bearing the Duke’s cipher from their Bois de Boulogne residence and dated October 20, 1957, shows they dined on Mousse de Gaumon Fumee, followed by a Mixed Grill and Coeur a la Creme. A gold-edged menu card bearing a gold crown cipher dated 21.10.1965 reveals the Windsors’ guests enjoyed Carre d’Agneau Rotir with puréed haricots verts followed by a selection of cheeses. Another lot reveals how the King conducted his secret affair with his previous married mistress, Freda Dudley Ward in 1919, as the 24-year-old Edward, Prince of Wales. The future couple met in a doorway in London’s Mayfair in 1918 as they sheltered from a Zeppelin raid. Socialite Mrs Dudley Ward, 23, had already been married for five years and had two daughters by a husband 16 years her senior, but that didn’t stop Edward from showering her with letters and gifts. One of the former is included in the auction and takes the form of a handwritten pencil note, dispatched to Mrs Dudley Ward on 28th May 1919. It is addressed to 'My very own darling precious little Fredie' and signs off with Edward's pet name, 'Your very own devoted and adoring little David.' Intriguing: A party invitation sent to Mr and Mrs Simpson by Edward VIII months before his abdication . Scandalous: This photo of the Duke and Duchess of Windsor is also part of the collection going on sale . The relationship with Mrs Dudley Ward continued for over a decade, eventually ending in 1934 when the future Duke of Windsor met Wallis Simpson. In another rare lot, there are two original cheques personally signed by the Queen Elizabeth, the Queen Mother and drawn on Messrs Drummond bank, which also held the accounts of King George III, Disraeli, Gainsborough and Isambard Kingdom Brunel. Both cheques are signed Elizabeth R. One for £495.75p is dated 1974 and is made out to the royal milliner Rudolf Ltd. The other, for £250 and dated 1978, is made out to Lady Katharine Seymour, the Queen Mother’s lady-in-waiting. Signing up: The Queen Mother wrote this cheque to cover a £495.75 bill from her milliner, Rudolf LTD . Elaborate: Ornately decorated invitations from more recent Palace receptions are also to be sold off . Pretty: A menu for a meal served during the 60th anniversary Philharmonia gala concert in 2005 . There is also a handwritten letter from the Queen Mother to dressmaker Madame Elizabeth Handley Seymour in 1937 describing her preferred design for her gown for King George VI’s Coronation after King Edward VIII’s abdication. Writing in the third person, she noted: 'The Queen is writing a line to Madame Handley Seymour to tell her that the dress for the Coronation (according to precedent) ought to be beautifully embroidered by some school of needlework. So that the Queen thinks that the Royal School of Needlework ought to do the embroidery ... ' 'It is very rare to find such a remarkable royal collection as this,' adds Grinter. 'It spans 200 years from Queen Victoria, through King Edward VII, King George V, the Duke and Duchess of Windsor, King George VI and the Queen Mother and our current Queen. 'The breadth, quality and condition of the individual items is amazing.'","The collection goes under the hammer in Colchester next week .

"A mother and her boyfriend have been indicted in the murder of her five-year-old daughter who was beaten to death just weeks after child services dropped its investigation into the family. Amanda Hendrickson, 33, and Roderick Buckner, 35, were indicted in Monroe County, Georgia on Tuesday for murder and aggravated battery in the death of Heaven Woods, WSBTV reported. Heaven was found unresponsive at Buckner's Forsyth home on May 20 and was pronounced dead in hospital. An autopsy showed that she had died of blunt force trauma to the abdomen. It also revealed evidence of other injuries, some old and some new - and after her death, it emerged that a teacher and family members had allegedly witnessed her being mistreated by her mother. Scroll down for video . Charged: Amanda Hendrickson and her boyfriend Roderick Buckner have been indicted for murder in the death of her five-year-old daughter, who died last year after blunt force trauma to her abdomen . Victim: Heaven Woods, pictured, was found unresponsive at Buckner's home last May and later died . Just three weeks before she died, one of Heaven's teachers reported seeing Hendrickson kicking the little girl hard in the back and contacted the Division of Family and Children Services. The agency launched an investigation but Hendrickson, Heaven and a family friend denied the little girl had been kicked and said she had bruises from falling. The teacher was never interviewed. The DFCS dropped the investigation - even though it was the ninth complaint they had had about the family since 2009, according to the case summary obtained by The Atlanta Journal Constitution. On one occasion, Hendrickson told the girl's grandmother that she had a bump on her head because she had fallen into a coffee table. When Heaven had bruises in the shape of a handprint on her neck, the mother claimed it was because the girl was autistic and would sometimes hurt herself. The property manager of their home in Rome also reported seeing the mother drag the girl around on a harness 'like a dog'. 'History of abuse': Heaven (left) was found to have new and old injuries on her body when she died, and it emerged that child services had been called nine times about her mother, who gave birth while in jail last year . Heartbroken: Hendrickson's mother Lisa Coursey said last year that both should face the death penalty if the accusations against them were true. She said she saw signs of abuse but bought her daughter's excuses . Relatives also reported seeing Hendrickson lift the girl off the ground by her hair and said Heaven had a black eye around Christmas. 'How do you get bruises to go away?' Hendrickson wrote on Facebook on the morning of Heaven's death. Ashley Coursey, Hendrickson's half-sister, told The AJC last year: 'I wish I would have stepped up and done something.' After the girl's death, her maternal grandmother, Lisa Coursey, added to WSBTV: 'I want the death penalty on both of them. If she did that to my granddaughter, she needs to rot.' It also emerged that Heaven's father Antony Woods had petitioned for primary custody of Heaven in 2012, adding that her visits with her mother should be limited because of violence towards the child. But Hendrickson responded that Woods was the violent one. Scene: The girl was unresponsive when emergency responders arrived at this home in Forsyth, Georgia . He continued his fight to see his daughter and petitioned the court in October 2013 and January 2014. The caseworker and their supervisor were removed from duties interacting with families while an investigation into their conduct was carried out. Hendrickson was taken into custody last year and, while in jail, she gave birth to another daughter, who has now been placed into state custody. She was initially charged with felony child cruelty but extra charges were expected to be brought. They will be arraigned on April 16, according to WSBTV.","Amanda Hendrickson and Roderick Buckner have been indicted for murder and aggravated battery in the death of her daughter, according to reports .

"Comedian Peter Kay has jokingly quipped that actor Ted Robbins is ‘off his head on morphine’ after telling of his relief after his colleague’s recovery.

He suffered twelve broken ribs and a cracked sternum as medics desperately battled to save his life. Mr Robbins, 59, will not now need open-heart surgery as originally feared and may leave hospital after a ‘routine’ procedure next week. In an interview, Mr Kay said how he and cast members of Phoenix Night Live were delighted by their close friend's speedy recovery. But he joked: 'We just re-calibrated as they say, moved things around, changed that bit and carried on. 'I’ve spoken to him and he’s making jokes same as ever - he’s off his head on morphine.' Ted’s sister Kate revealed her brother suffered rheumatic fever as a child, which affected a heart valve.

Mr Robbins' sister Kate described the moment her brother collapsed: 'We were all hysterically laughing and jumping up and down when he came on in the second half - his daughter Molly, his wife and his son Jack. 'Then he just dropped like a stone and we just said ""that's not in the act"". We ran and had to barge past, but security wouldn't let us on stage. 'Thank God there was a heart surgeon in the audience and a paramedic who just got there and saved his life. It was a surreal nightmare. But luckily he's doing great. 'What's been overwhelming has been the thousands and thousands of good wishes from everyone. 'There has been so many comedians saying such great things about him. 'Ted is known as ""the comedian's comedian"". He's known for his wit - but more so probably for his caring of other human beings.'

The Countess of Wessex took part in a fracture and plastering workshop with local school children . The mother-of-two made a conscious effort to chat to each and every child at the workshop . Sophie, who has two youngsters herself, seemed to be enjoying her day out assisting the children . Sophie recently celebrated her 50th birthday and last night attended an event thrown for her and her husband, Prince Edward, at Buckingham Palace . Sophie looked fresh-faced despite attending an event last night held by the Queen in Buckingham Palace. Her majesty was hosting a bash in honour of the Earl and Countess of Wessex, who both recently turned 50, and the work they do to support a wide range of charities. 375 guests attended the event from organisations including the National Youth Theatre, The Commonwealth Games Federation, The London College of Fashion, The Craft Guild of Chefs, The British Paralympic Association, MENCAP, the Shooting Star Chase children’s hospice and the Northern Ballet. The Queen hosted a party in honour of the Earl and Countess of Wessex and work they do to support a wide range of charities at Buckingham Palace this evening, which was attended by 375 guests. Before the event started, the Duke of York posted a picture of his mother, brother and sister-in-law in the Queen's private apartments on to Facebook . The Queen spent some quiet moments with close family members in her private apartments before they headed out to meet the guests. Her second eldest son Prince Andrew, 54, captured the moment on his mobile phone and uploaded the photo to his Facebook page. The Duke of York captioned it: 'A family photo before we join the guests at my brother and sister-in-law's joint 50th Birthday Reception at Buckingham Palace, to recognise the important work with their many organisations - AY.'

Dame Esther, 74, who was present because of her work with ChildLine and the NSPCC, even delayed her first meeting with her newborn grandchild to be there. She said: 'My second grandson was born at 7.30am and the reason that I am not at his bedside is because I am here. 'My son (Dr Joshua Wilcox, the baby's father) has forgiven me. 'I was able to say to Edward that the name of my grandson is Edward. But unlike His Royal Highness, he will be known as Teddy. 'He was a bounding 9lb 1oz and at dawn I get on the train to go to Torquay to admire him.' Sophie and the Queen share a joke while they wait for their guests to arrive . Dame Esther, who has attended the palace on numerous occasions through her charity work, described the value of royal support to a charity as 'almost unquantifiable'. She said: 'When people work every minute of every day with a commitment to a particular cause - admittedly they do it because they are dedicated. 'But to be able to shake hands with a member of the royal family is in a way the nation saying thank you.' The guest list at the event reflected Edward's interest in the arts and sport, his military appointments and his links with the Duke of Edinburgh's Award and International Award Foundation. It also marked Sophie's work with charities that help families, young people and children tackling avoidable blindness. Staff, volunteers and charity representatives were also present from The Duke of Edinburgh's International Award, Girlguiding, England Hockey, International Agency for the Prevention of Blindness and the Association of Show and Agricultural Organisations.

Quartz commissioned the two studies to see how people perceive the concept of the web. The findings go some way to confirm habits that were first reported by LIRNEasia in 2012. Helani Galpaya at the think tank spotted a pattern of negative answers to questions about the web during qualitative interviews. This suggested those asked weren’t web users, but the same people also admitted to using Facebook on their mobile. LIRNEasia said at the time: ‘It seemed that in [the minds of users], the internet did not exist; only Facebook.’ During these interviews, in Myanmar, Indonesia, Philippines and Thailand more people said they were Facebook users than internet users.

"A newly erected aluminium sculpture  has sparked public uprising after locals have claimed it looks like a penis. Transit Cloud, which is composed in part by four  mesh cloud forms, was constructed 8m above New Lynn train station in Auckland last Friday. The Auckland sculptor stands by the controversial artwork, claiming all art should provoke a reaction, reports New Zealand Herald. Transit Cloud, which was constructed 8m above New Lynn train station in Auckland last Friday . The Auckland-Council commissioned artwork cost about AU$190,000, as part of a bid to reinvigorate the quiet and traditionally working class suburb. But locals have taken jabs at the artwork, claiming it is inappropriate for such a prominent location. In a video with 3 News, a trio of giggling teenagers say: 'it looks like a giant private part.' 'I was surprised that it was erected,' says another local. 'Maybe the angle could be slightly shifted to change the visual concept?' A local man who told 3 News he was taken aback when the sculpture was erected . Locals have taken jabs at the AU$190,000 artwork, claiming it is inappropriate and it resembles a 'giant private part' Joy Dale, of Mt Roskill, said: 'It's certainly not a cloud. It looks like a penis.' She said the sculpture was a waste of taxpayers' money and the council should have spent the money on better security in the area. Sculptor Gregor Kregar said it was never intended to be a phallic image,  rather that it is intended to be a reference to the cloudsand raindrops. 'Art is out there to stir reaction,' Kregar told the Herald. He said he was surprised by the public response to the artwork, which he believes is 'fun and joyful.' Kregar has claimed the next development of the artwork-a 50 meter string of neon lights set to be ignited at night-will transform the appearance of the sculpture and alter public perceptions for the better. Daily Mail Australia has contacted Mr Kregar for comment.","Transit Cloud was erected 8m above New Lynn train station in Auckland .

"Cradling their newborns with their faces filled with love, these pictures capture heartbroken parents' final moments with their babies. The images were taken by the organisation Now I Lay Me Down To Sleep, who say they create the treasured memories by sending photographers to meet devastated parents and their terminally ill babies in hospital. The service has boomed in popularity since launching in the USA ten years ago and boasts 1,650 volunteers in 40 countries across the globe, who offer their services via the organisation's website. These images capture heartbroken parents' final moments with their dying children, like baby Logan Bostrom. Now I Lay Me Down To Sleep  creates the  memories by sending photographers to meet emotional parents and their terminally ill babies in hospital . Describing their mission on their website, the organisation writes: 'Our mission is to introduce remembrance photography to parents suffering the loss of a baby with a free gift of professional portraiture.' The organisation trains, educates and organises for professional  photographers to provide what they describe as 'beautiful heirloom portraits' to families facing the untimely death of an infant. 'We believe these images serve as an important step in the family’s healing process by honoring the child’s legacy,' they say. The organisation was founded by Cheryl Haggard, who had to make the excruciating decision to take her newborn son, Maddux Achilles Haggard, off life support in 2005. Maddux was born with a condition called myotubular myopathy, which prevented him from breathing, swallowing or moving on his own. Before doing so, they called photographer Sandy Puc to take pictures of them cradling their son, including some when he had been taken off life support, when, they say, 'he was free from the tubes and the wires that had sustained him'.

The organisation trains, educates, and organises for professional quality photographers to provide what they describe as 'beautiful heirloom portraits' to families who face the untimely death of their newborn, such as baby Hannah Grace Meyer . The nonprofit organisation is named after the children's bedtime prayer and captured baby Hannah Grace Meyer in her mother's arms . Cheryl said: 'That night was the worst night of my life. But when I look at the images, I am not reminded of my worst night. I’m reminded of the beauty and blessings he brought.' She realised that those tender photographs documented Maddux's 'eternal connnection' with his parents and inspired her to launch a non-profit organisation to give other grieving parents the same experience. Named after the children's bedtime prayer, Now I Lay Me Down To Sleep provides families of babies who are stillborn or extremely ill newborns with free professional portraits. They said about the service: 'Photographs are one of the most precious and tangible mementos that a parent can have, showing the love and bond that was given and shared with their baby. 'These portraits will last for generations, and will honor and remember a tiny life that is forever loved and cherished.' In one testimonial on their website, a couple explained how their final family portrait helped them grieve. 'On Saturday March 17, 2012 around 10:45 am, we said hello and good-bye to our beloved son.

The legislation will allow prostitution in the EUR business district south of the city with the aim of reducing the number of streets currently being used for the purpose. Pope Francis has called trafficking in Rome a 'shameful plague' St. Peter's Square, Vatican City . Prostitution is legal in Italy, and women plying their trade are a common sight in certain areas of Rome and other cities, but residents have long complained about the visibility of the sex trade. The proposal will mean that an estimated 70,000 to 100,000 women selling sex to around 2.5 million customers will be working in a safer environment, officials say. The council believes that by creating an official red-light district in what is a largely non-residential area, there will be less chance of trafficking, described by Pope Francis recently as a ‘shameful plague’. Residents of Rome have long been campaigning for a solution to reduce the visibility of the trade on certain streets, and it is believed the move could help shield children and families from the sex trade. Prositution is currently conducted on more than 20 streets in the EUR district of Rome . A prostitute walks in an alley of the Esposizione Universale Roma district . The plans include proposals to provide ‘psychological support and health care’ to prostitutes on the designated streets, and clients of prostitutes who work on non-designated streets risk fines of 500 euros (£370). Unsurprisingly, the proposal has been criticised by some Church figures, with the weekly magazine of the Conference of Italian Bishops, Avvenire calling it ‘shameful’. One councillor went as far as to suggest that the idea will create prostitution 'ghettos'. Giovanni Ramonda of the Pope XXIII Community was reported by English-language paper The Local as saying that with the legislation, Rome would be in effect introducing ‘tolerance zones for the slavery of women.’ The paper carried out a survey which found that nine million Italian men – more than one in three of the population – had used a prostitute at least once. If the experiment proves successful, the council may establish up to three separate red light zones within the district. Last week Pope Francis called for more help for ‘the men, women and children enslaved, exploited, abused as instruments of work or pleasure and often tortured and mutilated’. He urged governments to act decisively to remove the ‘shameful plague’ of trafficking which he called unworthy of a civilized society.","Red-light district approved by Mayor of Rome Ignazio Marino .

"A court in Germany has ruled that it is not a sackable offence for a man to grope a woman's breast in the workplace after a mechanic who fondled a cleaner won a legal ruling. Judges of the Federal Labour Court sitting in Erfurt said that the car mechanic who groped the 26-year-old while saying 'these look like fun' should not have been dismissed. They ruled that a single instance of groping was tolerable but said that serial fondling should result in the sack. The Federal Labour Court sitting in Erfurt, pictured, made the ruling saying that a single instance of groping was 'tolerable' The mechanic said he didn't know what came over him and paid the woman some compensation but said he was upset to be fired. He was sacked in 2012 over the incident and appealed the decision through various courts before it ended up at the Erfurt courthouse this week. Judges heard that the man had a 'moment of madness' when he caressed the breasts of the cleaning lady. The court was told he made comments about her, and then grabbed hold of her, when he encountered her in the bathroom at the garage where he worked near Erfurt. She immediately pushed him away and complained to his boss. In a conversation with his employer, he admitted the incident and stated that he had 'forgotten for a second' who he was. He apologised to the woman, paid her some money and promised it would not happen again - but he was still sacked for sexual harassment in the workplace. After hearing of the circumstances of the case, the apologies of the man and the fact that he was 'sincerely sorry' the court released a statement about their findings. The ruling was made after hearing the case of a mechanic who groped the breasts of a cleaning lady at a garage where he worked (stock picture) It said: 'Sexual harassment in the workplace must not lead to the immediate termination of the offender. 'If unethical approaches actually entail a dismissal, it should depend always on the circumstances of the case.' The Labour Court said a 'cease and desist' letter should have sufficed, and that firing the man, aged 37, who had worked at the firm for 16 years, was a step too far. The garage has been ordered to reinstate him but has said it may appeal the verdict. The ruling comes after another case dealt with by the court last year when they upheld the sacking of a furniture store employee who liked to continually pat the behinds of female staff members.","Judges made ruling on case of mechanic who groped cleaner in workplace .

The judge ruled that both women can stay in court to watch proceedings after testifying. The judge also said he would allow prosecutors to take photos of Routh's tattoos. All eyes were on Routh Tuesday as he entered the courtroom in Erath County for a pretrial proceeding looking markedly different from his 2013 booking photo. Instead of a mop of shaggy hair and patchy beard covering his gaunt face, Routh appeared clean-shaven, sporting with close-cropped hair and a pair of dark-rimmed glasses. With his bulkier frame filling out his black suit and pressed light-blue button-down shirt, the 27-year-old murder suspect looked nearly unrecognizable when compared to his arrest photos taken in February 2013. Routh, a former Marine, is charged with capital murder in the deaths of 38-year-old Chris Kyle and Kyle's friend, 35-year-old Chad Littlefield.

"Kasia Rivera, 37, (pictured in 2012) from New Jersey, is facing new charges of illegally injecting silicone into a woman's buttocks and breasts . A bogus cosmetic surgeon, who allegedly fatally injected a man with silicone during a penis enlargement procedure, is facing new charges. Kasia Rivera, 37, from East Orange, New Jersey, had been due in court on February 27 on charges of reckless manslaughter and the unauthorized practice of medicine relating to the death of 22-year-old Justin Street in 2011. However new charges were brought against Rivera on Tuesday after she allegedly illegally injected a woman with silicone. Rivera, who had been out on bail on the manslaughter charge, was take into custody on Tuesday after the judge raised her bond to $200,000, NJ.com reported. If she is released at a later date, Judge Ronald Wigler told her: 'You are not to commit any new crimes whatsoever. You are not to inject anybody with any kind of needle.' The bogus surgeon was arrested in December 2011 following the death of Mr Street who attended a 'pumping party' at her East Orange home. It has been alleged that Rivera injected silicone into the 22-year-old's penis. Mr Street suffered a clot to the lungs owing to a a silicone embolism and authorities believe Rivera administered similar black market injections to other unsuspecting customers. The 22-year-old's death, the day after he received the injection, was ruled a homicide following an investigation. In the new case, Rivera has been charged with the unauthorized practice of medicine after she allegedly injected silicone into a woman's buttocks and breasts at least four times. Rivera, 37, appeared on Wednesday (pictured)  in a Newark courtroom with her attorney, Olubukola Adetula, and Essex County Assistant Prosecutor William Neafsey . The illegal injections came to light after a 17-year-old girl was hospitalized due to a silicone injection. Another woman, 35-year-old Alexis Patterson, is accused of injecting the teenager and has been held on aggravated assault and the unauthorized practice of medicine charges on $100,000 bail. Separately Rivera was charged in December with giving false information to a police officer and possessing a stun gun. Justin Street, 22, died after receiving an illegal silicone injection in a penis enlargement procedure in 2011 . According to nj,com, Essex County Assistant Prosecutor William Neafsey said on Tuesday: 'She's continuing to do these acts.' Silicon injections are used to enlarge body parts such as the buttocks or breasts. The only cosmetic use for non-encapsulated medical silicone approved by the FDA is Botox, for injection around the eyes. However black-market illegal use by untrained practitioners continues as a quick-fix budget alternative to cosmetic surgery. Doctors have said the slow economy has also fueled the trade in illegal silicone injections. In some cases, silicone can migrate through the bloodstream, resulting in a potentially fatal clot in the heart, brain or lungs. The silicone can also migrate through tissue leaving disfigured lumps. There is also no guarantee of medical-grade silicon at so-called 'pumping parties' cosmetic events held in homes, offices and even motel rooms. Industrial-grade silicone purchased at hardware stores is sometimes used as are toxic substitutes such as castor oil, mineral oil and petroleum jelly.","Kasia Rivera, 37, from New Jersey, due in court on February 27 on charges of reckless manslaughter relating to  death of Justin Street, 22, in 2011 .

"Classified ads: John Linder claims his wife Sharon had multiple lesbian relationships after advertising her services as a prostitute on ads site Gumtree . A solicitor is fighting to divorce his wife by claiming she advertised herself online as a ‘lesbian prostitute’. John Lindner, 63, told a court his wife Sharon had had ‘multiple lesbian relationships for money and kind’. He named 13 women with whom he claimed the mother of his two children had liaisons. Mr Lindner is trying to divorce her on grounds of alleged ‘unreasonable behaviour’, but she denies his accusations and has branded him a violent bully. The solicitor previously brought a sheaf of adverts to court, which he claimed his wife, 37, had posted on websites including Gumtree and Yahoo. He claimed she ‘had a string of lesbian lovers’ and ‘offered herself to other women, sometimes on a commercial basis’, the Court of Appeal heard. His ex-wife, who has reverted to her maiden name of Rawlins, argued he had been ‘controlling and violent’. In 2013 a family judge found Mr Lindner had broken her leg with a metal toilet roll holder, the court heard. He was convicted of assault and harassment, but the assault conviction was overturned on appeal. Yesterday Lady Justice Black branded the claims ‘a distraction’ from the divorce and urged the pair to bury the hatchet. The couple, from Bromley, south-east London, who married in 2005, have been at each other’s throats since their separation in 2012. Delays: Yesterday Lady Justice Black branded the couple's conflicting claims ‘a distraction’ from the divorce and urged the pair to bury the hatchet and finally end their marriage . At an earlier hearing, a judge warned: ‘Precious family resources are being spent on this contested divorce and one can only guess at the effect on the children of the relentless litigation between their parents.’ But both have continued to accuse the other of unreasonable behaviour, Lady Justice Black told the court in London. It heard Mr Lindner tried but failed to make Gumtree and Yahoo disclose details of any advertisements his wife had placed. He also demanded to see a police statement by a woman he claims had a relationship with his wife – Pauline Southerland, who had made a complaint of criminal damage to her Sky satellite dish. Miss Rawlins insisted she and the woman ‘are not and never have been lovers’. But a previous hearing heard that Miss Southerland said in a police statement ‘she is seeing the wife and that they are in a relationship’. Mr Lindner was appealing against a refusal to disclose that statement, but the judge dismissed it, saying: ‘More than two years have elapsed since [Mr Lindner and Miss Rawlins] separated. They could now be divorced … without the need to engage in hurtful, time-consuming and distracting litigation over how they behaved.’ It paves the way for a final divorce hearing, when a judge will decide whether either party behaved unreasonably.","John Lindner accused his wife Sharon of 'multiple lesbian relationships'

"Like so many 20-somethings, low funds forced Brett Pechey to come home from southeast Asia. Unlike many 20-somethings, police officers and about 25 charges were waiting for him when he got there. One of Queensland's most wanted bikies, Pechey was taken into custody after touching down at Brisbane International Airport about lunch time on Wednesday. The 26-year-old spent more than a year living in Thailand - first Bangkok, then Phuket - after fleeing Australia after a violent bikie brawl at Broadbeach in 2013. The alleged one-time boss of the West End Bandidos had been living off profits from a clothing business and funds channelled via friends and family in Australia. He allegedly begged his grandmother for $25,000, a request which was ignored on instruction from 'fed up' family members, reported The Courier-Mail. Scroll down for video . One of Queensland's most wanted bikies, Brett Pechey was taken into custody after touching down at Brisbane International Airport . The 26-year-old spent more than a year living in Thailand - first Bangkok, then Phuket - after fleeing Australia after a violent bikie brawl at Broadbeach in 2013 . But when both of those sources dried up, he decided to come back. The heavily-tattooed offender will now face a host of charges including extortion, threatening violence and stalking. Detective Inspector Brendan Smith said police had been pursuing extradition options when negotiations with Pechey led to him boarding a plane and handing himself over voluntarily. While detectives are still investigating Pechey's links to Sydney's Brothers 4 Life gang, Det Insp Smith said he seemed chastened by his time on the run. Video footage (pictured) showed Pechey to be one of the 'more significant players' in the Broadbeach incident, Det Insp Smith said . Pechey is shown standing up to police during the 2013 Broadbeach brawl. He fled Australia soon after . 'He certainly hasn't got the bravado that they would normally have,' he said. 'He appears resigned to the fact things have changed.' Video footage showed Pechey to be one of the 'more significant players' in the Broadbeach incident, Det Insp Smith said. The other charges he's facing relate to a number of dawn raids conducted by police last March across Brisbane, Gold Coast and Logan. The raids netted nine patched Bandidos members and led to members of the West End and Centro chapters being charged with extortion offences. Police claim they'd used standover tactics to intimidate victims, some cornered at gyms, into handing over money and property. One victim even required facial reconstruction surgery after suffering a broken nose, fractured eye socket and chipped teeth, while another was allegedly threatened with a hand gun and a baseball bat. Det Insp Smith said a number of criminal motorcycle gang members remain living overseas but are not currently wanted by police. 'Realistically, I hope they never come back,' he said. Pechey is expected to appear in Brisbane Magistrates Court on Thursday. The other charges he's facing relate to a number of dawn raids conducted by police last March across Brisbane, Gold Coast and Logan .

"An army of airborne drones could soon be used to bring mobile phone signal and wireless internet access to the remotest parts of the UK. Britain’s biggest mobile phone group EE has begun working on the technology, which it hopes to deploy by the end of the decade. Using unmanned drones to broadcast phone signal to rural communities is cheaper than erecting traditional masts, it says. EE has revealed its manifesto to improve network coverage in the UK as part of its Signalling the Future manifesto. They want more than 99 per cnet of the country to have 4G by 2017. By the same year 90 per cent of the UK will also have access to double-speed 4G, accomplished using unmanned drones and balloons . The devices, called Air Masts, are still at an early stage of development. But early plans indicate they will be able to fly 0.6 miles (1km) into the air in order to pick up signal from masts up to 12 miles (20km) away. EE has announced that it plans to spend £1.5 billion ($2.3 billion) upgrading its 4G network across the UK. By 2017 the company wants to ensure that its services are extended, especially rural areas, with the goal of giving more than 99 per cent of the country access to 4G. To do so, they will use tethered-balloons and drones to reach remote areas, such as setting up temporary 4G areas at music festivals. Their ‘Signalling the Future’ manifesto is designed to tackle the UK’s changing digital infrastructure needs. This will include a Rural Investment programme to vastly improve voice and data services for the UK’s countryside areas. And they plan to supply more than 90 per cent of the population with access to double-speed 4G by the same year, capable of speeds of up to 60Mbps. And so-called 4G+, faster than regular 4G, will be rolled out to the 20 biggest UK cities by 2017, with speeds of 150Mbps. They will then beam this signal into the area below it, allowing villages below to make mobile phone calls and access the internet. This avoids the need to expensive cables in the ground and base stations. The drones would work in pairs in order to ensure that one was always airborne. Each one can hover in one spot for hours, but when it lands to recharge, the other would take its place. It is likely they would be forced to land during periods of bad weather, meaning that communities would be without access in storms. But EE thinks this would be more efficient, as it would not be forced to send teams to repair masts damaged by weather. ‘In the UK, there are still many places where you can’t make a phone call,’ said chief executive Olaf Swantee said. ‘We want to solve that.’ He said the company’s aim with the project was to ‘radically improve mobile coverage, this time with a strong focus on rural parts of the UK’. It comes as part of the company’s pledge to spend £1.5 billion ($2.3 billion) over the next three years to expand its network. This will allow it to offer superfast 4G internet speeds to 90 per cent of the country. The devices, called Air Masts, are still at an early stage of development. But early plans indicate they will be able to fly 1km into the air in order to pick up signal from masts up to 20km away. They will then beam this signal into the area below it, allowing villages below to access the internet (stock image of drone shown) As part of its  £1.5 billion ($2.3 billion) plans to upgrade its 4G network across the UK, by 2017 the company wants to ensure that its services are extended, especially to rural areas, with the goal of giving more than 99 per cent of the country access to 4G (stock image shown) Under its plans, which are still in an early stage of development, the company wants to use flying drones in areas it would be too expensive or too difficult to lay cables. While companies such as Facebook and Google are developing balloons to broadcast internet to remote parts of the world, EE’s scheme would be the first time unmanned drones will be used to provide mobile signal. As well as rural areas, the company could use the drones to provide mobile access for areas that host short-term events, such as music festivals or sporting events. It is also exploring the possibility of using weather-style balloons as well as drones to provide mobile signal. EE is currently in the process of being bought by BT in a £12.5 billion ($19 billion) deal. But the company insists that it will continue to develop the technology after the takeover is complete.","EE has revealed its manifesto to improve network coverage in the UK .

"Presidential favorite Hillary Rodham Clinton on Wednesday met the man who appears to be angling for his own role on the political world stage - London Mayor Boris Johnson. The former Secretary of State and Johnson, who is seen by some as a future leader of the Conservative Party and potential British Prime Minister, shook hands for the cameras at her New York office. There was no mention of gaffe-prone Johnson's 2007 remarks where he referred to Mrs Clinton as a 'sadistic nurse in a mental hospital' in a newspaper column. Scroll down for video . London Mayor Boris Johnson and former US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton shared a laugh in New York on Wednesday ahead of a discussion about Russia and the threat of ISIS . Making friends: Mayor of London Boris Johnson meets presidential frontrunner Hillary Clinton at her office in New York on Wednesday . Clinton asked the London mayor, who holds dual citizenship of the UK and U.S. Clinton and Johnson laughed and joked as they posed for photographers ahead of a 50-minute meeting to discuss terrorism issues facing the UK and U.S. along with the war in Syria and Iraq against ISIS. It was Clinton's turn to mock the mayor's political ambitions today as she asked whether U.S.-born Mr Johnson had set his sights on the White House. She said: 'Is he announcing for president? Which one do you think he'll be, Democrat or Republican?' The jibe came amid criticism of Johnson's 'promotional tour' of the U.S., that some suggest he is using it to boost his chances of being the next Conservative leader - and then potentially British Prime Minister. In a 2007 column in The Daily Telegraph, Johnson tore into then-presidential hopeful Clinton. He wrote that he disliked 'an all-round purse-lipped political correctness' but did grudgingly endorse the then New York senator. Johnson was on the charm offensive this week, telling The Evening Standard that Clinton was 'an extraordinary politician'. Johnson was in New York on the fourth day of a six-day trip - his third long-haul mission in the last three months, having already visited Iraq and Far East. It is his second trip to the U.S. in three months. Johnson, who has dual U.S. and UK nationality as he was born in New York, began his visit with a speech in Boston on how innovation can help the poor. Following the meeting, Johnson tweeted: 'Just met w/@HillaryClinton for talks on security, the threat of ISIL returnees & the synergy between London & NYC.' Mr Johnson also met with former New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg, as well as the British stars of Broadway and New York fashion week.

"It brought satire to a generation by sending up Margaret Thatcher, John Major and the Royal Family - now Spitting Image is to turn its guns on a new batch of politicians and celebrities. The cast and crew of the show which drew huge audiences in the 1980s and 1990s are being reunited to lampoon figures including Russell Brand, Vladimir Putin and Boris Johnson. Promising a 'biting look at the world of politics and celebrity', ITV's six-part series, called Newzoids, will include impressions by Jon Culshaw, who worked on Spitting Image, as well as the voice of Debra Stephenson. Scroll down for video . Those to be lampooned in the new show include, from left: Beyonce, Boris Johnson, Vladimir Putin, Nigel Farage, Russell Brand and Andy Murray . The original Spitting Image sent up a succession of political figures, including Prime Ministers Margaret Thatcher, who was portrayed wearing a man's suit, and John Major, whose puppet was painted grey . Among the targets for its satire are David Cameron and Nick Clegg, who will be portrayed appearing on the Jeremy Kyle show, Boris Johnson, Nigel Farage and Andy Murray. Other famous faces that will be lampooned include Geordie duo Ant and Dec, Harry Styles and Simon Cowell. The show is co-produced by Citrus Television, which was set up by another Spitting Image veteran Giles Pilbrow. Pilbrow, who has also worked on animation 2DTV and CBBC's Horrible Histories, has said the new programme's aim is to 'amuse people' rather than 'bring down the government'. Spitting Image ran for more than a decade and its puppet parodies and near-the-knuckle humour made it one of the most-watched shows of the 1980s and 1990s. 1 - The singles chart position the latex puppets held for three weeks in 1986 with The Chicken Song, a spoof of Black Lace’s Agadoo. 3 - People were needed to work each of the original puppets because they were so cumbersome. 40 - Puppets in all – including pop stars Mick Jagger, Paul McCartney and Bob Dylan – were made for the first series. 131 - Episodes of the show were made over 18 series. 350 - Puppets which were auctioned for £370,000 at Sotheby’s in 1999, including Sid James, which fetched £1,900. Between 1984 and 1996 a regular audience of 15 million tuned in to watch the mockery of politicians, pop stars, sports personalities, religious figures and world leaders. The show won ten BAFTAs and two Emmys. The show made the careers of people like Harry Enfield, Steve Coogan and Jan Ravens, who provided the voices, and Ian Hislop, Richard Curtis and Ben Elton, who wrote scripts. Many puppets were auctioned. One Thatcher puppet sold for £10,200 and Cherie and Tony Blair went for £12,000. Newzoids will cost much less than the £250,000 each half-hour Spitting Image episode cost to produce, with advances in digital manipulation allowing lower-tech puppets to be used. Speaking about the new show, ITV's director of entertainment Elaine Bedell said: 'ITV has a rich history of playing popular satirical comedy in peaktime on its main channel, and it seemed a good time to revive it this year. 'We are pleased to be adding to our growing comedy portfolio with this funny and biting look at the world of politics and celebrity.' The new six-part show will appear on TV screens in the spring. The team behind the new show includes Jon Culshaw - who worked on the original Spitting Image - and former Coronation Street actress Debra Stephenson, who both appeared  on The Impressions Show (pictured) In its 12 years on our screens, Spitting Image mocked politicians from Westminster and around world, the Royals, sport stars, musicians and TV presenters. Its most famous puppet was perhaps that of Margaret Thatcher, who wore a man’s suit in the show and treated her Cabinet with contempt. One of the shows most famous moments was when, with the then-Tory cabinet around the dinner table, a waitress asked: ‘What about the vegetables?’ The model of Mrs Thatcher replies: 'Oh, they'll have the same as me.' The Queen was often depicted wearing a head scarf and studying the horse racing pages of newspapers . Thatcher's successor, John Major, came in for equally merciless treatment, with his puppet painted grey to reflect his perceived dull personality. In a further mocking of the Tory leader's perceived lack of charisma, some of the most famous scenes to feature him showed him and his wife, Norma, eating peas. Major would occasionally say: 'Nice peas, dear.' The Royal Family were not spared the Spitting Image treatment. The Queen was habitually portrayed with a headscarf and CND badge and the Queen Mother carried a copy of the Racing Post and spoke with a Birmingham accent. One of the most famous sketches to feature the Royals appeared after Prince William was born, when the Queen broke a bottle of champagne over his head to 'Christen him'. International leaders also featured in the show; Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev’s distinctive birthmark on his head was shaped into a hammer and sickle while US President Ronald Reagan was shown in bed with two red call buttons at his side, one marked 'Nurse', the other 'Nuke'. The puppet of Tony Blair became famous for its huge smile. The models of him and his wife, Cherie, sold for £12,000 at auction in 1999 . Labour's Roy Hattersley (left) was shown spraying everyone with spit as he lisped and Norman Tebbit (right) was portrayed as Mrs Thatcher's tough leather-jacketed enforcer .","Cast and crew responsible for Spitting Image have reunited for new project .

"Another act in a legal drama featuring a mobster and a violin played out Wednesday when a prison chaplain told a Chicago courtroom minutes before the start of his trial that he was guilty of trying to help an imprisoned mob hit man recover a hidden Stradivarius. Eugene Klein, a Roman Catholic priest, was accused of plotting with Chicago Outfit enforcer Frank Calabrese Sr. to recover a rare, 250-year-old violin that Calabrese hid years earlier in his Wisconsin home, to keep authorities from selling it. They believed it was worth as much as $26 million. Calabrese has killed 13 people. Guilty: Former prison chaplain Eugene Klein pleaded guilty Wednesday to conspiring to recover what he believed to be a Stradivarius violin hidden by the late Chicago mob boss Frank Calabrese Sr . Court: Klein, who wore a Roman collar during the appearance on Wednesday, tried to help Calabrese recover what they believed was a 250-year-old Stradivarius violin hidden by Calabrese years earlier . Klein, 66, of Mesa, Arizona, wore a clerical collar and gripped a cane as he walked into the hearing, where half a dozen witnesses sat on a back bench ready to testify in the long-planned trial. But the clergyman surprised the courtroom by saying he wanted to forgo the trial and plead guilty. Several minutes later, he did just that. He answered calmly when U.S. District Judge John Darrah asked him if he did what prosecutors accused him of doing. Killer: Chicago mobster Frank Calabrese Sr. ran loansharking and illegal gambling operations . He leaned forward and responded, 'I'm guilty of the offense.' The offense is the stuff of Hollywood films. Prosecutors say the plot was hatched in 2011 when Klein was administering communion to Calabrese at a prison in Springfield, Missouri. Calabrese was sentenced to life in 2009 for 13 murders, including strangling some victims with a rope then slashing their throats to ensure they were dead. He was also ordered to pay $4.4 million in restitution. He died in a federal prison in North Carolina in December 2012, aged 75. After Calabrese's imprisonment, federal authorities continued to search for his assets. Prosecutors say the longtime Chicago Outfit enforcer wanted to ensure that agents could never get hold of the violin that once belonged to entertainer Liberace, saying he'd rather the priest profited from its sale. Prison authorities kept Calabrese in strict isolation after he was accused of threatening a prosecutor during his trial in the same Chicago courthouse, allegedly mouthing to the government attorney: 'You are a ... dead man.' According to prosecutors, Klein broke prison rules by accepting a note Calabrese passed a note to him — wrapped in religious materials — through the food slot of his cell. It directed Klein to look in a second-floor bedroom, behind a pull-out door and against a wall in the home in Williams Bay, Wisconsin. 'That is where the violin is,' the note said. Potential goldmine: A Stradivarius violin like the rare model mobster Frank Calabrese Sr. claimed to have stashed away . Prosecutors say Klein even called a real estate agent selling the Wisconsin home, posing as a potential buyer. The plan was for another unnamed conspirator to distract the agent during a tour of the home while Klein and another person retrieved the violin. A federal search in 2010 did turn up a million dollars in cash, diamonds and other valuables in a wall behind a family portrait in Calabrese's Chicago-area Oak Brook home. But despite searches at the Wisconsin home, no violin was found. Klein pleaded guilty to conspiring to defraud the United States. Klein, who has been free on bond, will be sentenced June 23; he faces a maximum five years behind bars. Plot: Prosecutors say the plan was hatched in 2011 when Klein was administering communion to Calabrese at a prison in Springfield, Missouri . In the Oak Brook search, prosecutors found a certificate indicating the violin may have been a much less valuable one made in 1764 by Giuseppe Artalli, and not by the renowned Antonius Stradivarius. Asked Wednesday outside the court what motivated him to help the notorious hit man, Klein declined to speak. His attorney, Thomas Durkin, said his client made 'an error in judgment,' though he added Klein is partly being made to pay for his good work providing spiritual guidance to convicts, like Calabrese. 'This,' Durkin said about Klein's prosecution, 'ranks right up there with no good deed goes unpunished.'

"A giant dog named Joker and a small pony called Tigger have become the best of friends thanks to the fact they are almost identical. The pair's friendship blossomed when their owner Ronnie Jones introduced them at her stables in Summercourt, Cornwall. Three-year-old Joker, a Harlequin Great Dane, has distinctive black and white markings which are very similar to the coat of Tigger - a miniature spotted stallion. Scroll down for video . Three-year-old Joker, a Harlequin Great Dane (left), and 15-year-old miniature spotted stallion Tigger (right) became best friends after being introduced by owner Ronnie Jones (centre) at her stables in Cornwall . The pair share similar black and white markings and since Tigger (left) is just 34 inches tall, the two animals measure up at about the same height. They are said to be inseparable and get taken on walks together . And since 15-year-old Tigger is just 34 inches tall, the two animals measure up at about the same height. Owner Ms Jones, 63, often takes them for walks together, putting them both on dog leads and parading them through her village. She said: 'It is such a pleasure for me to have two animals that get on so well - they're the best of friends - even if we do get some funny looks.' Despite the age gap, the pair have been inseparable since Ms Jones got Joker as a puppy. On walks, Joker sidles up to Tigger and the pair settle next to one another at Ms Jones's stable when she goes to muck out. When Ms Jones take Tigger to horse shows all over the country, Joker goes along for the ride and watches patiently from the sidelines.

'But when they are out together they tend to get a lot of double takes. 'We regularly get people pulling out their camera phones to snap the phenomena of a horse and pony the same size strolling through the village. 'We once even have a lady pull up in her car at red lights, wind down her window to take a picture and then cause a traffic jam behind her because the lights had changed!

"The United States is preparing to withdraw nearly all of its troops fighting the Ebola outbreak in West Africa, the White House said on Tuesday, as the global health crisis recedes amid a sharp decline in Ebola cases. Of the 2,800 troops the U.S. deployed, just 100 will remain in West Africa after April 30, officials said. About 1,500 of those troops have already returned home. Those staying in West Africa will work with Liberia's military, regional partners and U.S. civilians to continue fighting Ebola. Of the 2,800 troops the U.S. deployed, just 100 will remain in West Africa after April 30, officials said. About 1,500 of those troops have already returned home . ‘Just 10 months since the first U.S. government personnel deployed, we have delivered extraordinary results,’ said U.S. Agency for International Development Administrator Rajiv Shah, adding that Ebola cases were down 80 percent and that in hard-hit Liberia, new cases have dwindled to just one or two per day. President Barack Obama was to announce the withdrawal and outline the next steps the U.S. plans to take on Ebola at an event on Wednesday at the White House. The move comes as Ron Klain, who led Obama's Ebola response and was informally dubbed the ‘Ebola czar,’ wraps up his work. The White House said Klain debriefed Obama as the Ebola response enters a new phase. The Pentagon said all returning troops will undergo ‘established controlled monitoring procedures’ to ensure they have not contracted Ebola. While careful not to declare the crisis over, the White House touted declining Ebola cases as a sign that U.S. and global efforts had paid off. Officials said the U.S. helped build 15 Ebola treatment units, trained more than 1,500 health workers and coaxed the world community into contributing more than $2 billion to Ebola efforts. President Obama is preparing to withdraw nearly all of its troops fighting the Ebola outbreak in West Africa, as the global health crisis recedes amid a sharp decline in Ebola cases . The worst Ebola outbreak in world history has killed almost 9,000 people, and the World Health Organization has warned it will be challenging to bring cases to zero. The outbreak is expected to cost the three most-affected countries - Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea - at least $1.6 billion in lost economic growth. Obama faced intense initial criticism over his administration's Ebola response, particularly after health workers contracted the virus at a Texas hospital while treating a patient that had been infected in Africa. The U.S. tightened policies at home and dedicated a surge in resources to West Africa to address the epidemic. There has been a sharp decline in Ebola cases in recent months to just 150 a week down from more than 1,000 new cases per week in October .","Of the 2,800 troops the U.S. deployed, just 100 will remain in West Africa after April 30 .

"They say imitation is the most sincere form of flattery, but for Kari Anderson, 42, it could have been deadly. The former model from Lytham St Annes, Lancashire, was almost left paralysed after a jealous neighbour laid a tripwire outside her door, sending her hurtling down two flights of stairs. The trap was the climax to a bizarre sequence of events, which included Kari's next door neighbour Janet Pearson changing her appearance and dress style to seemingly look like her. Kari Anderson, 42, from Lancashire, suffered a string of bizarre incidents with jealous neighbour Janet Pearson, that culminated in Janet leaving a tripwire at the top of the stairs. The trap sent Kari hurtling down two flights and left her with serious bruising and a brokwn . Then in January 2014, Kari tripped over the wire as she walked out of her apartment, suffering severe injuries to her face, wrist, neck and back. Her neighbour Janet was convicted last month of setting the tripwire and will be sentenced on February 5. Kari also describes how Pearson would sit at an upstairs window - overlooking the driveway - and watch Kari as she went about her daily affairs. Kari, a 42 year old law graduate and former model, said: 'At first I was quite flattered that she wanted to look like me, but then it became creepy. 'It was unnerving. I started to worry that she was jealous of me - or even infatuated in some way. 'But I could never have foreseen what she did next. Kari Anderson now runs a property business but used to work as a model . 'What upsets me most is that she was inside her flat as I went bumping down the stairs; she must have heard me screaming for help, and yet she ignored me. 'I could have died that day.' Kari, who runs a property business, bought her luxury penthouse next door to Pearson's one-bedroom flat in upmarket Lytham St Annes, Lancashire, 15 years ago. She began living there herself two years ago, along with her 25-year-old son, Stephen. Kari said: 'When I had first met Janet she seemed nice, there was no problem. But after I moved in there, she had just split with her long-term partner and was really quite upset. 'She then had a knee operation, and she piled on weight, going from a size 12 to a size 20. 'Maybe she felt like life was going against her, because she seemed quite bitter. Janet Pearson, who has been convicted of assault causing actual bodily harm against Kari . 'Whenever I came home from holiday she would say: ""It's all right for some."" 'I got the impression she was jealous. 'But I have worked very hard for what I have. Janet has never had a job as long as I've known her. She had no reason to resent me at all.' A few months on, Kari noticed that Janet was beginning to change her hair and dress style. She said: 'Janet had brown hair but she had it coloured blonde, like mine. Then, she got hair extensions, so that it was the same length as mine. 'I always wear leggings and the same make of boots - and Janet started to do the same, which was completely different to her usual style. 'At first, I suppose I felt a bit flattered, though I couldn't see why she would want to copy me. But then, it began to freak me out. 'One day I bumped into her and she was wearing the exact same shade of orange lipstick which I wear every day. It was creepy. 'I began to wonder whether she was obsessed with me in some way. It was like the film Single White Female.' To add to Kari's concerns, Janet would spend most of her time sitting at a window which overlooked their shared driveway. Kari sa: 'At first, I'd spot her and wave. I didn't think anything of it. But then, I noticed that whatever time I came home, Janet was there. 'Sometimes, I'd come home from work at 1am or 2am - and she was watching me. 'As I was unlocking my front door, she would come out. If I had been somewhere nice, perhaps on holiday, she'd make a nasty comment as if she was jealous.' Kari also noticed that large amounts of her mail were going missing, including bank statements and business letters, from the shared letterbox in the apartment complex. She sa: 'At first I blamed my son, thinking he was losing it. I went to the sorting office and complained to them. I even called the police. 'I had no proof where the mail had gone. 'The police said the easiest thing would be to get my own locked letter box, and after that, the problem was solved.' In October 2013, Kari paid a tradesman £800 to build a large storage cupboard outside her apartment. But when she came to use it, shortly afterwards, she found it full of Janet's belongings. Kari says: 'I couldn't believe it. The cupboard was full of unopened disability aids, which Janet had been given by social services, but didn't use.' The wire at the top of the stairs that caused Kari to fall. She took the picture with her mobile phone after dragging herself back up . The point at the top of the stairs where the wire was placed . She continued: 'I asked her politely to take them out but she refused. I told her that if she didn't move them, I would. We didn't have a huge argument but we certainly exchanged words.' Kari says: 'Looking back, the tension was building. She watched me and my son enjoy a family Christmas and then we went on holiday. 'For some twisted reason, I think she resented me.' Days later, in January 2014, Janet set the tripwire which was to bring the whole saga to a horrific end. Kari says: 'I often get up early for work and on this particular day, I was ready to leave at 5am, with my overnight bag in one hand and a bin-bag in the other. Kari Anderson is still reeling from the tripwire attack as she left her flat early one morning . 'The stairway in the hall was unusually dark as we were waiting for an electrician to fix the lights.' As Kari reached the top stair, she felt something sharp on her shin and she hurtled headlong down two flights of stairs. She says: 'Instinctively, I put my hands out and my face smashed against the wall as my wrist was bent backwards. 'I landed upside down, and the pain was horrendous. I was convinced I had broken my neck. 'My brother broke his neck as a teenager, and all I could think of was that the same had happened to me, and of how my poor mum would cope. 'I could taste blood. It was running down my face and in my hair. 'I was screaming for help and sobbing loudly, but nobody came. I was so disorientated, I couldn't even remember whether my son had come home the night before or if he was at his girlfriend's.' Realising that help might be hours away, Kari dragged herself back up the stairs, in excruciating pain, and found her mobile phone - smashed but still working - along the way. It was then, with the light of the phone, that she saw the tripwire. She says: 'I was anxious to see what had caused my fall. I thought maybe a banister had fallen out or a carpet rod had come loose. 'But then I saw the wire, wrapped several times around the banister to make it absolutely tight - and the other end disappeared inside Janet's flat. In horror, Kari went back inside her own apartment, where her screams awoke her son. Kari likened her situation with her next door neighbour to the film Single White Female, starring Jennifer Jason Leigh and Bridge Fonda (pictured). In the movie, a woman tries to find fulfillment by trying become her successful roommate . She says: 'When my son realised what had happened he rushed down and took photos of the tripwire. 'But in-between then - and the sound of the sirens approaching - the tripwire was removed.' Kari was taken to hospital with injuries to her face, neck, back and wrist. Pearson was arrested but denied the offence. She was bailed and allowed to return to her flat, next door to Kari. Kari says: 'There was no remorse at all. If anything, as she saw me struggling with my injuries, she looked rather smug.' Janet Pearson appeared before Preston Crown Court in December 2014 and was convicted of assault causing actual bodily harm. She is awaiting sentence. Kari says: 'I am still suffering the effects of what she did. I have terrible headaches and have damage to the upper part of my spine. 'My right wrist is also badly injured, which means I've had to give up painting; a hobby I used to love.' After the incicent, Kari was taken to hospital with injuries to her face, neck, back and wrist . She continued: 'I ask myself constantly why she would do such a wicked thing. We'd had a couple of minor disagreements, but there was nothing to suggest this. 'She must have heard me as I fell down the stairs - I bumped along her lounge wall. 'She must have heard me screaming and pleading for help, yet she did nothing. 'I could drive myself mad with trying to understand what happened but I'm a survivor and a fighter, and I will bounce back from this. 'Janet has slowed me down, but she won't beat me. I only hope the courts give her the punishment she truly deserves.'","Kari Anderson, 42, suffered string of bizarre incidents with her neighbour .

"A Pennsylvania pain management doctor is accused of getting a dozen of his female patients hooked on strong narcotics and then using their addictions to sexually assault them. Jay J. Cho, 71, was arrested on Tuesday with charges including rape and aggravated indecent assault. Cho, who had offices in both Cumberland and Franklin, is accused of drugging women for as long as five years. Perverted desires: Jay J. Cho, 71, is accused of getting the women addicted to strong narcotics before threatening to stop filling their prescriptions unless they gave in to his sexual demands . The New York Daily News reports that Cho allegedly gave women large quantities of painkillers such as Oxycodone until they became addicted. He is accused of baiting women for sexual favors with refill prescriptions. 'The vast majority of the patients were afraid that he would not see them as patients anymore if they rejected his sexual advances,' Upper Allen Township said in a release. 'The manner in which Cho interacted with these patients was clearly outside the normal doctor and patient relationship.' Upper Allen Township Police Chief James Adams further criticized Cho for 'creating addicts and/ or advantage of people with addictions for his own personal and perverted desires.' Hampden Township Police Chief Steven R. Junkin called Cho a predator who did more harm to patients than good. 'A doctor who peddles drugs to addicts and then uses the control of the drugs to profit and further victimize the patient, transitions from practitioner to predator,' he said. 'There is no room in society for these predators and today, with endless hours, exhausting interviews, old fashioned hard work and interagency cooperation; we've hopefully removed this predator's ability to ruin more lives.' Years of abuse: Jay J. Cho, 71, pictured a few decades earlier, is believed to have gotten at least 12 patients addicted to strong narcotics in order to fulfill his own twisted desires . The affidavit of probable cause contains numerous and repeated examples of Cho sexually assaulting patients, giving them large amounts of serious controlled substances outside the bounds of accepted pain management practice, meeting with female patients with no staff member in the room and repeatedly contacting female patients outside of the times for their visits, said the police report. The report said that three of the patients told police that the assaults occurred when the doctor knew they were under extreme stress in their personal lives. The patients stated that they were afraid of being cut off from the drugs to which they were addicted. In 2010 a patient filed a police report saying that she had been assaulted by Cho but she never made an official complaint. In May 2014, another female patient accused him of assault and that’s when police launched another investigation. One patient review on Vitals.com accused Cho of over prescribing drugs. 'His staff are very immature, not helpful at all! The doctor is very hard to understand. All he is interested in his prescribing pills. This is not true pain management. Stay away! ' wrote an anonymous reviewer. He apparently has 43 years of experience and has been named as a top doctor in Pennsylvania, according to Vitals.com. Medical records for many of the victims were obtained and reviewed by an independent medical expert in Anesthesiology and Pain Management. The report states that the amount of opiates prescribed to each patient far exceeded the established standards of care and the that care provided by Dr. Cho fell well below national standards of care. Cho turned himself into police on Tuesday following a warrant for his arrest for rape, aggravated assault, drug delivery by practitioner, criminal use of a communication facility, indecent assault, possession of a controlled substance and harassment. Cho is being held on $375,000 bail.","Dr. Jay J. Cho, 71, was arrested on Tuesday with charges including rape and aggravated indecent assault against 12 women .
Cho allegedly gave women large quantities of painkillers such as Oxycodone until they became addicted so he could sexually assault them .
Police Chief James Adams further criticized Cho for treating patients for the advantage 'of his own personal and perverted desires'
The patients stated that they were afraid of being cut off from the drugs to which they were addicted ."
"Bloody and bawling, they emerge from the womb to take a first, momentous breath. These intensely intimate photographs capture birth in its raw glory as each baby is delivered by caesarean section, lifted from its mother and held to the light. Taken by French photographer Christian Berthelot,each frame is shot within the child's first 20 seconds of life. The 38-year-old from Brittany, France, started project just six months after his own son was born. A new exhibition in Paris features a series of pictures of babies just seconds after they are born by caesarean section. Pictured is Mael - born December 13, 2013 at 4:52 p.m.2kg 800 - 18 seconds of life . Liza - born February 26, 2013 at 8:45 am3kg 200 - 3 seconds of life . Dr. Jean-François Morienval, an obstetrician in the hospital where his son was born, asked Christian if he would be interested in taking a series of portraits on the profession of midwifery. After a long discussion, the pair decided that the best solution would be for Christian to join the doctors and nurses in the theatre while the child was being born through c-section. The planning needed to undertake the project then took six months, with Christian needing training to work in a surgical  environment, requests for permission to take photographs in the clinic and requests for permission to take photographs of the mothers. He also needed prepare mentally for what he was going to be seeing. Christian said of the first time he was in surgery to take the photos: 'I thought back to the birth of my son. The whole team was there and attentive. 'The doctor watched me from the corner of his eye, to see how I would react if I was going to faint or run away. And I did not even know how I felt. 'So I hid behind my camera and I did my job.' Louann - born April 12, 2013 at 8:40 am3kg 574 - 14 seconds life . Romane - born May 20, 2014 at 10:512kg 935 - 8 seconds of life . Christian continued: 'Everything went very quickly. It was a big slap in my face. I made photographs throughout the duration of the surgery. 'When everything was over and everything was fine, I went home. I drank coffee and waited several days. 'I knew I was not going to look at the world the same way.' After taking the five pictures that the doctor asked for over a period of weeks, Christian realised that the photographs they had worked on together provided a unique way of looking at birth. Since then, he has gone on to photograph more than 40 different babies in the first few seconds outside the womb, which is now being shown at an exhibition in Paris called the CESAR series. He said: 'My perspective on the birth has changed. I discovered the dangers of birth. 'It is for this reason that I have decided to show the beginnings of a new human being, during the first seconds of his life. I am interested in those first seconds only. 'And what continues to amaze me is that it never stops. With each passing moment, a child is born, from all over the world, all the time, births never stop. Lize - born December 24, 2013 at 8:49 am3kg 574 - 9 seconds of life . Kevin - born December 27, 2013 at 10:36 am4kg 366 - 13 seconds of life . Leanne - born April 8, 2014 at 8:31 am1kg 745 - 13 seconds of life . Christian acknowledges that some people might find these pictures difficult to look at, but he says that he sees beauty when he looks at the images. He said: 'I know there are people who react very badly, who find it disgusting, they tell me that I do not have the right to show the children in the bloodstream, some even told me that it is not real, it is not true. 'This is absurd, children are not born in cabbages or roses. 'And there are those who are fascinated, I give them the opportunity to observe in detail the violence of birth. 'But there are also people like my wife, who encouraged me to do this work, because c is beautiful birth.' CESAR is being be shown in France during the Festival Circulations' Festival Circulation Exhibition from January 24 to March 8, 2015 at Centquatre, 5 Rue Curial, Paris. www.festival-circulations.com .","Photographer Christian Berthelot captures babies born by C-section .

"Two new immigrants have arrived in the United States for every new job created nationwide, during the years stretching from 2000 and 2014, according to government statistics. The pressures on America's labor market could be extreme in coming years as wave after wave of immigrants – both legal and illegal – crowd into the U.S. and compete for increasingly scarce paying positions. The Center for Immigration Studies, a center-right group that opposes expanding opportunities for illegal immigrants, compiled numbers that show the massive disparity between an influx of human capital and the employment opportunities availabe to them. About 18 million people moved to the United States from other countries between 2000 and 2014. But only 9.3 million new jobs were created during that same period. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEOS . President Barack Obama met in the Oval Office of the White House on February 4 with illegal immigrants wh owere brought to the US as children; his 'Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals' (DACA) program, implemented without Congress, allows them to stay and receive work permits without fear of deportation . Protesters gathered last June near the Mexican Consulate in Austin, Texas represent a growing number of Americans who believe immigration overload is costing native-born Americans jobs . The total number of new immigrants since 2000 (2nd bar) and the net gain in working-age Americans who are in the country legally (4th bar) together dwarf the number of new jobs (1st bar) Adding greater concern for Americans who are looking for work, the pool of eligible workers who were born in the U.S. is also expanding at a record pace. The native-born population age 16 and older grew by 25.2 million in the same 15 years. 'There is no labor shortage,' CIS research director Dr. Steven Camorata writes in a brief report issued Wednesday. 'Despite this, Congress is considering proposals to increase legal immigration even further. ... Congress's disregard for the absorption capacity of the U.S. labor market has profound consequences for American workers.' Republicans on Capitol Hill are already brandishing the report as new firepower in this week's slugfest over President Barack Obama's plan to mainstream millions of illegal immigrants and give them work permits. The White House's plan is Exhibit A in a contentious squabble over funding for the Department of Homeland Security, which oversees U.S. immigration. 'The president's policies are systematically displacing Americans from the workforce,' Stephen Miller, spokesman for Sen. Jeff Sessions on the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Immigration, told Daily Mail Online. JOBS AMERICANS WON'T DO? Missing in the Center for Immigration Studies report is a sense of what kind of jobs new immigrants – including illegals – are taking in the US . Illegal immigrant entries in the US have trended up since the beginning of the century, adding millions more to their numbers since 2000 . IMPACT: SInce 2006 the percentage of immigrants in the US who have jobs has been larger than the same percentage of native-born Americans . 'A record influx of low-paid labor is holding pay down and making jobs harder to come by,' he added. 'Real weekly earnings are lower now than they were in 1979. The American wage-earner is on the losing end of a policy designed by and for the special interests.' Sessions chairs the subcommittee and has emerged as one of the Senate's leading immigration hawks. 'We must be taking steps to curb the flow of unskilled labor,' Sessions said on Tuesday. 'and help families already living here – whether past immigrants or U.S.-born – find good jobs, good schools, and thriving communities.' Varying estimates from the government's Bureau of Labor Statistics, the U.S. Census Bureau and the Pew Research Center indicate that of the 18 million immigrants who entered the U.S. between 2000 and 2014, between 4.5 million and 6.0 million did so illegally. One result, CIS said Wednesday, is that 'the number of working-age natives not in the labor force (neither working nor looking for work) increased by 13 million.'","US created 9.3 million new jobs since 2000 .
But 18 million immigrants came to the US in those years .
Native-born American population of working age grew by 25.2 million .
The result is a low labor-participation rate, a job shortage, and grist for the mill of Republicans who are trying to stop illegal immigration ."
"Today show host Karl Stefanovic has admitted to smacking his children as he weighed in on a fiery debate on discipline after a mother was charged over slapping her four-year-old son in the face. Police charged the 34-year-old woman with assault on January 9 after a member of the public reported seeing the alleged incident at a shopping centre in Perth. The woman's husband and father of the boy said it happened after the child went into a meltdown and she was forced to discipline him for biting into an apple they hadn't paid for. Scroll down for video . Today show host Karl Stefanovic has admitted to smacking his children as he weighed in on a fiery debate on discipline after a mother was charged over slapping her four-year-old son in the face . The incident caused a heated debate on Nine's Today show on Wednesday with Karl Stefanovic, Mornings host David Campbell and newsreader Sylvia Jeffreys passionately arguing their points. When pressed during the Grill segment, Stefanovic admitted to smacking his children in the past as a form of discipline. 'I have. I was smacked as a kid,' he said. But Campbell argued the 'violence' needed to stop. 'I'm huge compared to (my son), I'm not going to hit my children. They're too small and too fragile,' he said. 'I don't like it. I'm one of on those parents that thinks the cycle needs to break.' Police charged a 34-year-old woman with assault on January 9 after a member of the public reported seeing her allegedly slap her child in the face at a shopping centre in Perth (file photo) While Sylvia Jeffreys admitted her opinion on smacking was still forming because she didn't have any children of her own, she said she was sympathetic to the situation the mother had found herself in. 'Every parent has certain moments in life where everything falls apart and that's the only option you can take at that moment,' she said. 'I'd like to think that eventually I won't (smack my children), but I just don't know what circumstances I will find myself in. 'I was smacked as a child and I can certainly say without question that I don't lean towards violent tendencies as an adult, I don't believe that violence is an answer for anything.' The incident caused a heated debate on Nine's Today show on Wednesday with Karl Stefanovic, Mornings host David Campbell (left) and newsreader Sylvia Jeffreys (right) passionately arguing their points . While Sylvia Jeffreys admitted her opinion on smacking was still forming because she didn't have any children of her own, she said she was sympathetic to the situation the Perth mother had found herself in . The incident in Perth was sparked when the four-year-old boy took a bite out of an apple in the supermarket and put it back. The mother then paid for the apple but wouldn't give it back to her son. He then supposedly had a temper tantrum and the mother smacked him. 'My wife does have arthritis, so her discipline below the head has been laughed at in the past... She's slapped my son to the side of the face, which is probably uncalled for, but it was done,' the boy's father told 6PR radio on Monday. 'He was rebelling a bit so she's clipped him on the side of the face, not necessarily aiming for that.' The man said officers stopped his wife in the car park to inspect their three children and later arrested her at the family home, taking her away in a police van. Sylvia admitted that she was smacked as a child, but in no way had it given her violent tendencies as an adult . When pressed during the Grill segment on Wednesday morning, Stefanovic admitted to smacking his children as a form of discipline . CCTV footage from the shopping centre has been handed to police as they continue to investigate. The father of the boy has slammed police for terrifying his children. He said there was no history of abuse against the children and their son was not injured. 'They were all bruise free, not a mark on them,' he said. 'They were mortified at the fact that their mum was in trouble, who was also broken down in tears.' The mother is due to appear in court on March 12. It comes after a Queensland political candidate was forced to withdraw from the state election after CCTV footage emerged of him smacking his child across the head in a busy cafe. Independent candidate Jason Deller was caught on camera pouring a jug of cold water over his baby son before slapping another child in the head at Buddina last month.

"The Irish word for film, scannán, seems innocuous enough to Gaeilgeoirs. But a group of YouTube users has been using it as a secret phrase to hide pornography on the site and circumvent a ban on explicit material. The issue was highlighted after an Irish media student searched for 'scannán' and the plural 'scannáin' only to find pornographic footage featuring Asian women. The Irish word for film, scannán, seems innocuous enough to Gaeilgeoirs. But a group of YouTube users has been using it as a secret phrase to hide pornography on the site and circumvent a ban on explicit material . The films, disguised using various Irish language titles, were uploaded by four different accounts which were all registered in October. Connemara-based Maitíú Ó Coimín, a journalist with the Irish language website Tuairisc, first reported the issue after his flatmate found the material. 'My flatmate is a media student in Galway who was looking up [the Irish word for film] on YouTube for a project,' Mr Coimín told the BBC. The issue was highlighted after an Irish media student searched for 'scannán' and the plural 'scannáin' only to find pornographic footage featuring Asian women. YouTube has since removed the videos . Watching porn on laptops replaced the magazine, and now it seems mobiles are set to replace viewing adult sites on desktops. Last year, the number of people accessing porn on smartphones rose by 12 per cent. Android users, in particular, viewed the most pornographic videos last year, accounting for almost half of mobile users - an increase of 11 per cent. The figures come from Pornhub Insight’s 2014 Year in Review report. The site saw 78.9 billion video views over the past 12 months, up from 63.2 billion in 2013. Phones equated for 45 per cent of these views, the desktop was on 44 per cent, with tablets on 11 per cent. This is a 20 per cent increase for tablets. 'I looked a bit further into it, and there were about 15 to 20 films of a questionable nature.' Mr Coimín added that the accounts were probably not owned by Irish speakers – or Gaeilgeoirs - as the phrasing in the description suggests an online translation tool was used. Instead, the four channel appear to originate from Russia, Italy, the U.S. and Japan. Mr Ó Coimín believes many other languages are being used like this to get around YouTube's policies. 'Our team was quick to take action,' a YouTube spokesperson said. 'YouTube's community guidelines clearly state that sexually explicit content is not allowed on our site. 'We remove videos and channels that violate our policies when flagged for our attention. 'YouTube staff review flagged videos 24 hours a day, seven days a week, to determine whether they violate our community guidelines.'","Scannán, the Irish word for film, and its plural, 'scannáin' were used .

'Grant always wanted to join the Army but that didn't work out because he's injured his breastbone. So he started doing some work for Help for Heroes every Wednesday at the surf lodge.

"With rival Mitt Romney officially out of the 2016 presidential race, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush is now poised to clean up on the cash front and will host tonight a $100,000 a plate fundraiser for his political action committee. Officially launched last Thursday, Bush's Right to Rise super PAC will hold a cash-gathering event tonight for the creme de la creme of New York that has even Wall Street Republicans blushing at the price of admission, according to Politico. Tonight's fundraiser will be hosted at the Park Avenue home of billionaire Henry Kravis, a private equity mogul, and wife Marie-Josée. Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush is pictured here on Tuesday at the Keeping the Promise: A Florida Education Summit, sponsored by Bush's Foundation for Florida's Future, at the Florida State University Alumni Center in Tallahassee. The Republican presidential frontrunner is cleaning up cash this week even as his campaign makes embarassing missteps . Kravis is among the richest 100 Americans, and, along with George Roberts, a fellow founding partner of private equity firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co, he is one of the GOP's top financiers. A longtime supporter of the Bush family, Kravis supported the the presidential campaigns of both Jeb's father, George W., and brother, George H.W. He and Roberts are separately listed as having given at least $100,000 to the Republican Party the year that George H.W. was elected to the Oval Office. Known to be a backer of gay marriage, he is now emptying his pockets for Bush the younger, who ruffled conservatives' feathers last month when he released a statement saying Americans must 'show respect' for same-sex couples 'making lifetime commitments to each other who are seeking greater legal protections.' A spokesperson for Bush wouldn't confirm the per person cost of tonight's bonanza to Politico, but the publication says it was confirmed by two other sources. A Wall Street executive who was invited told the publication, 'I shook my head when I heard the number.' Still the only major Republican to have stated his intentions to explore a presidential bid, Bush has an early fundraising lead over a dozen possible Republican opponents. His early frontrunner status hasn't been all rainbows and sunshine, however. Already this week an aide had to resign a day after his new position with Bush's PAC as chief technology adviser was revealed after Buzzfeed caught him deleting years old tweets that were defamatory to women. The same day Bush came under scrutiny for accidentally allowing the personal information, including Social Security numbers, of people who emailed him while he was governor of Florida to be included in a massive release of his correspondence from that time.","A Wall Street executive who was invited: 'I shook my head when I heard the number.'

"A Florida man who allegedly beat to death his girlfriend's son after the child made a mess in his pants has been arrested and charged with premeditated murder. Corey Gordon, 28, was found by Broward Sheriff's Office SWAT unit in Fort Lauderdale on Tuesday, a day after three-year-old Khyese Anthony Coach was taken to hospital by his mother. The little boy was already dead. The mom, Chantel Haye, 20, told The Orlando Sun-Sentinel that she had left Khyese with Gordon while she started a new job. Premeditated murder: Corey Gordon, 28, has been charged with the murder of his girlfriend's three-year-old son, who is believed to have been beaten to death . Killed: Little Khyese had just celebrated his third birthday on Saturday. He died on Monday . Haye and Gordon had been dating for one year. Gordon picked up Haye and her son around 5:30 am from the apartment they share with Haye's mother, sister and nephew. Gordon dropped Haye at work and then took the child to his home in North Lauderdale, which he shares with his sister. During her morning break, Haye called Gordon, who was furious that Khyese's soiled diaper had leaked on his sister's furniture. The two did not talk again until 3:45 pm, when Gordon picked her up from work. 'There were tears in his eyes,' Haye told The Sun-Sentinel. Haye asked Gordon what was wrong but he didn't answer her, so she got into the car. Khyese was on the backseat and Haye initially thought he was sleeping. 'But when I looked more closely at him I saw bruises on his face, his temples, his nose,' Haye said. 'I kept saying, 'What happened to his face?'' Gordon told her the boy was sleeping and had thrown up, and that he thought the boy was sick, Haye said. She got into the backseat to check on him, and realized Kyese was not buckled in and was cold. Murdered: Khyese's mother said her son had marks all over his body and was cold . 'His arm was stiff — it was so unreal,' she said. 'I thought it would break.' Panicking, Haye told Gordon they needed to go to hospital, but Gordon was driving slowly and wouldn't go any faster. Haye said Gordon told her that he he was 'going to jail'. When they finally got to Broward Health Coral Springs, Haye ran inside with Khyese, but Gordon drove away. Nurses saw the toddler and called a code blue, signifying cardiac arrest, Haye said. A short time later a doctor came to tell Haye that Khyese was dead and had been for at least three hours. 'I was in denial,' Haye said. 'I didn't know he was fully gone.' Gordon was booked into Broward's Main Jail around 2 am Wednesday on a charge of premeditated murder.","Corey Gordon, 28, was charged with premeditated murder on Tuesday .

"How was Valentine's Day for you last year? Did you both snuggle up at the end of the evening, luxuriating in each other's arms, whispering sweet nothings? Or did it end in a huge, stonking row with both of you on your sides, staring stonily at opposite walls? Valentine's day is one of the two days in the year that couples argue the most, this is because we are often left disappointed, here Tracey Cox explains why he's not living up to your expectations . If it's the latter, you're not alone. Valentine's Day and New Year's Eve are the two nights of the year couples are most likely to argue. Why? Expectations are high - and men and women's idea of romance are streets apart. Make this Valentine's run smoother by seeing things from a different perspective... 1. HE DIDN'T SEND FLOWERS TO WORK . Why is it infinitely better for a huge, expensive bunch of flowers to arrive at the office rather than be delivered in person by him? The show off factor, of course. Everyone wants to look like the most adored person in the office and what if everyone except you got sent flowers? Good reasons why he didn't: . From being low on funds to feeling intimidated by the way you look there are plenty of reasons why he isn't conforming to your idea of the perfect Valentine's date . 2. HE DIDN'T BOOK THE RIGHT RESTAURANT . There are three Valentines' choices that go down well. Dinner in your 'special' restaurant - where you met or he proposed or something else significantly romantic happened. Dinner in the hottest place in town (so you can boast the next day) or dinner somewhere expensive. His 'Let's give V-Day the finger and head to the local pizza joint!' suggestion does not go down well. Good reasons why he didn't: . Tracey says that it's important to bear in mind that his definition of romance isn't necessarily yours . 3. HE DIDN'T TELL YOU HOW FAB YOU LOOKED . Your hair's blow-dry glossy, you spent two week's salary on your dress, your shoes are so high, your little toe's already throbbing - and all he says after a quick once-over is 'Hi! Happy Valentine's Day.' Would it kill him to say 'You look better than Rosie Huntington-Whiteley - on a good day'? Good reasons why he didn't: . 4. THE PRESENT DIDN'T COST ENOUGH . 'It's the thought that counts' might apply when it's your five-year-old niece lovingly pressing an old sweet wrapper into your hand for Christmas. But a hell of a lot of women think the more money he spends, the more he loves them. Good reasons why he didn't spend up big: . 5. HE WASN'T AFFECTIONATE ENOUGH . You're smack bang in the middle of a packed restaurant, surrounded by tons of couples who are all over each other. He's not even holding your hand across the table or playing footsie. Why he isn't: . 6. HE DIDN'T SAY ROMANTIC THINGS . On every other day of the year, he's always coming out with the cutest, nicest comments about how much he adores you. On the day when he's supposed to, nada. One strained 'I love you' and that was that. Why he didn't: . 7. HE DIDN'T PROPOSE . You're checking your Champagne glass, digging around in the chocolate fondant with your spoon, eyeing off his jacket pocket to see if it's bulging. Where is he hiding that damn ring? Why he didn't: . It really doesn't mean he doesn't love you, if he doesn't make a fuss on Valentine's Day. Some guys are just conscientious objectors to the concept and, let's be honest here, it takes little effort to call and order a bunch of red roses. There are infinitely better ways to express love and his definition of romance isn't necessarily yours. One of my all time favourite research statistics is the study where men in long-term relationships were asked to do something romantic for their wives. Forty percent washed her car! I rest my case. For inspired Valentine's Day ideas on what to buy, see Tracey's gift guide suggestions for him and her.","Valentine's Day is one of the two nights a year couples argue the most .
This is because we have massive expectations and are left disappointed .
Tracey Cox explains exactly why he might make mistakes this Saturday .
Because you work with women who date bankers and if he can't compete, he figures you'd prefer his more modest bunch handed over privately.
Because he baulked at paying a delivery fee that's tripled for one day of year.
Because it seemed more practical to give them to you himself, since he was seeing you that night.
Because it's excruciating to have to sit there and look loving and say all the right things in a restaurant he feels comfortable in, let alone one where he's terrified he'll pick up the wrong fork.
He can't afford it.
He figured cooking a meal for you himself was more special.
You seriously do give Rosie a run for her money and he's suddenly paranoid he's not good-looking enough for you.
He clocked you've gone to a lot of effort to look good and worried the present isn't right/expensive enough/you're upset because he didn't send flowers to work.
He actually prefers you in your old skinny jeans and a T-shirt. You don't seem like you 'all done up'.
He can't afford it and can't justify hiking up the credit card even higher when he's likely to need it for important things. Like rent.
He secretly suspects you're a gold digger and wants to test whether you're with him for his money by not being extravagant.
He didn't have a clue what to buy so procrastinated - and ended up in Paperchase half an hour before you were due to meet.
He's inwardly cringing at how forced everyone else looks.
He feels that if he follows suit, he'll look forced. Or clichéd. Or just plain stupid. Besides he can feel you turning into Ms Frosty Pops and he's scared he'll be rebuffed and look even more idiotic.
He feels so self-conscious in this environment, he's scared he'll laugh.
See above. Surrounded by all the cheesy hearts and pink balloons and red roses, he's already suffocating in sentiment.
He thinks anything he says will seem disingenuous - that he's only saying it because he's supposed to.
He resents being told to do something romantic on a certain day of the year just because society dictates it.
He didn't think you'd want to share your anniversary with millions of other couples.
He's planning on doing it somewhere private and more meaningful than in front of a room full of strangers.
You've only been dating two months."
"Afsana Kayum, 22, allegedly filled out an 'Islamic Marriage Form' in a section of a terrorist magazine in the hope that she could find a 'Jihad' husband . A young Muslim woman hoped to find a husband through an Al Qaeda propaganda magazine which she kept on a USB stick on top of her parents' wardrobe, a court heard. Afsana Kayum, 22, allegedly filled out an 'Islamic Marriage Form' included in one of the issues of Inspire magazine and said 'he must be determined to do Jihad'. Snaresbrook Crown Court heard a stash of 10 copies of the terrorist magazine were found when police raided her parents' home in Plaistow, east London, in September 2013. Prosecutor Steven Gray said Kayum was first visited by police five months earlier in an attempt to prevent her being radicalised. He told jurors: ‘On 29 May 2013 officers from the Channel team of the Counter Terrorism command attended Miss Kayum’s family home - that team is part of a programme to target people who may be vulnerable to radicalisation.’ Kayum refused to speak with the officers until she had sought legal advice, and refused to speak to them again when they returned in July the same year. Mr Gray said: ‘They were there to offer help, if indeed she wanted it, to stop her going down the wrong path and she was provided with a telephone number to contact the police. ‘The officers explained to Miss Kayum’s mother in front of Miss Kayum, that they were concerned she held extreme views, but she would not discuss the matter at that stage.’ Officers from the unit returned again in September to execute a search warrant on the property, seizing Kayum’s phone, her letters and also the family’s shared laptop. Just before leaving, officers discovered a USB stick on top of the wardrobe in Kayum’s parent’s room with the help of an extendable mirror. Mr Gray said: ‘Some of the items that were seized were examined by experts and were found to contain extreme ideological material that justifies, glorifies and indeed encourages terrorist activity.’ The USB stick contained a number of Kayum’s YouTube videos, as well as all 10 issues of the Yemen-based propaganda magazine including its special edition ‘The Lone Mujahid Pocketbook’. Mr Gray said: ‘The magazine has articles containing realistic and practical considerations for any aspiring terrorist, and it’s the contents of these magazine that this charge focuses on.’ Among them was the marriage form, in which she allegedly wrote: 'I like to keep up to date with current affairs and what's happening to Muslims around the world, and I like to write letters to Muslim prisoners.' In a section titled 'Things I am not willing to compromise on' she wrote: 'He must be determined to do Jihad and encourage me to do the same'. 'He must carry out all obligatory acts in Islam which includes Jihad, which needs to be done,' she added. Kayum also listed 'establishing institutions to teach the ignorant' as one of her goals for her and her future husband. She had included a telephone number for her father in case anyone was interested in her as a wife. Mr Gray said: 'This document, which appears to have been completed by the defendant, undoubtedly assists us with who was using this USB stick.' She appeared at Snaresbrook Crown Court today where she denied possessing 10 copies of Inspire magazine and extremist YouTube videos . Some of the files on the USB stick were stored onto Kayum's mobile phone, and she had also accessed the files via the family laptop under her own user name, the court heard. She had carried out searches for terms including 'sanctity' and 'endurance exercises', it is said. The court heard Inspire magazine explains how anyone can become a terrorist, saying, ‘All that is needed is the willingness to give one’s life for Allah.’ One of the issues contained an article called ‘The Ultimate Mowing Machine’ and gave step-by-step instructions on how a pickup truck could be fitted with blades to mow down closely packed pedestrians. It said: ‘The blades don’t need to be very sharp because with the speed of impact even the blunt end would cut through bone very easily.’ It recommends finding a tightly packed crowd in a confined space for maximum effect, adding ‘If you have access to firearms carry them with you so you can finish your work if your vehicle is grounded.’ The article tells the reader to consider acts of terrorism a ‘one-way street’ because it would be too difficult to get away undetected. An extract read to the jury said: ‘You keep on fighting until you achieve martyrdom - you start the day in this world and by the end of it you are with Allah.’ The magazines also had detailed instructions on how to use and maintain and AK47 machine gun, recipes for home-made bombs and how to use a programme called ‘Fileshredder’ to avoid being caught by police. It also explains how would-be terrorists could attempt to blow up a building by filing it with gas or attacking its gravity centres and load-bearing walls. Mr Gray said: ‘The defendant’s possession of this material is not likely to be in dispute, but it’s the reason for the possession of this material that may well be in dispute.’ The prosecution claims Kayum had also been exchanging text messages with Ruksana Begum, 23, who was jailed in December 2012 for possession of two copies of Inspire magazine. Mr Gray said: 'This messages are significant because it shows Miss Kayum was aware of the risks she exposed herself to if she was caught in possession of this material.' She also allegedly sent a text message to 100 recipients imploring them to 'Write a letter or a message to our Muslim brothers [in jail] even if it's just a few meaningful lines.' Kayum later sent a follow-up text message complaining that only two people had responded to her appeal for letters, the court heard. She appeared in the dock in a bright pink floral headscarf and black jacket, and took notes throughout the prosecution’s opening speech. Kayum denies one count of possession of a record containing information contrary to the Terrorism Act. The trial continues.

"Two more police forces have been caught asking British newsagents which sold copies of satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo for details of the customers who bought it. Officers from Wales and Cheshire police have approached shopkeepers and demanded personal information on readers of the magazine, according to reports. It comes after police in Wiltshire caused outrage by demanding similar details be handed over in the wake of the Paris attacks. It appears that The Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO) was handed a list of Charlie Hebdo's UK stockists  by John Menzies, one of the the magazine's UK distributors. ACPO then alerted forces who had shops selling Charlie Hebdo in their area, saying that officers should be aware that the magazine was on sale. According to an ACPO spokesman, the alert suggested that police may wish to visit the shops involved, but only if there were signs of rising tensions. A Wiltshire Police officer visited  a small newsagents and post office in Wiltshire and requested the personal details of all subscribers to the Charlie Hebdo magazine (pictured), which was the subject of a terrorist attack. Now it has emerged that officers in Wales and Cheshire have also approached shopkeepers . The ACPO advice did not recommend visiting each shop, and did not mention taking down the details of customers who had bought the publication, according to the spokesman. It would appear that the three forces concerned either misunderstood the advice, or acted on their own impulse when they decided to ask for information on customers. John Menzies initially denied leaking information to the police, but since ACPO issued a statement to the contrary, they have refused to comment. Smiths News, another Charlie Hebdo distributor, has also refused to comment. The move has been branded 'entirely unacceptable' by privacy campaigners. An ACPO spokesman said: 'John Menzies, as the distributor for Charlie Hebdo within the UK, provided the police service, through the National Counter-Terrorism Policing HQ, with a list of outlets which were stocking the edition of Charlie Hebdo released following the Paris atrocities. 'This was done so that local officers could be aware of any potential tensions on their beat arising from the sales of the magazine, given the situation following the killings. 'At no point was any guidance given from a national level to forces asking them to act on the information passed over by John Menzies, and no national advice was given to forces that they should visit stockists or ask them for further information. 'Some newsagents may have been visited by officers seeking to provide reassurance to business owners but decisions on doing so will have been made at a local level. 'The police service’s duty in this matter is to protect the communities it serves and defuse tensions where they exist.' Paul Merrett, 57, owner of a newsagent in Presteigne, Wales, said a detective and a police community support officer arrived at his shop and started to question his wife about the people who bought them. He said: 'They wanted to know where we had got them from, and did we know who we had sold them to. Wiltshire Police has since apologised for the incident and said the officer's motivation was 'purely around enhancing public safety'. The force said that information obtained during the visit had been 'disposed of' '[My wife] said she wasn't prepared to give any names. She thought we were in trouble for selling them originally, but they said we weren't, and they just wanted to know who bought them. 'We didn't give them any details. It was all very strange. There were a couple of customers in here at the time, so it soon got around town.' A Dyfed-Powys police spokesman said: 'As part of ongoing community engagement and following recent terrorism incidents globally Dyfed Powys Police have been undertaking an assessment of community tensions across the force area. 'As part of this assessment it was decided that it would be prudent to visit newsagents who maybe distributing the Charlie Hebdo magazine to offer proportionate advice and reassurance due to the heightened publicity surrounding the publication. 'It was not the intention to gather any personal information of those who purchased the magazine and we can confirm no purchaser details were asked for or recorded.Dyfed Powys Police can confirm the visits were only made to enhance public safety and to provide community reassurance.' The Guardian reports that in Warrington, Cheshire, a police officer also called a newsagent that had sold the copy, and asked for information on the customer. But Cheshire police denied this was the case. A spokesman said: 'Officers were asked to call into local newsagents in their area to provide visible reassurance around the time of publication and were not asked under any circumstances to make enquiries as to who was purchasing or preordering the Charlie Hebdo magazine. 'Each area endeavored to visit as many newsagents as possible however we cannot provide an exact figure.' Anne Keat, 77, was among those who ordered a copy of the publication  and said she was 'baffled' by police wanting the names of those who bought it . Emma Carr, director of Big Brother Watch, said: 'The Charlie Hebdo attack brought millions of people worldwide together to condemn those who seek to silence free speech through threats of intimidation and violence. 'This move by the police is entirely unacceptable. This sort of investigation would be understandable if a crime was being committed, but the fact is that they have requested information about people who have purchased a perfectly legal publication. 'It is far from clear why the police thought it was acceptable to request this information or what it is that they actually intend to do with it. Considering the comments made in the aftermath of the attacks in Paris by world leaders, that free speech should be celebrated and encouraged, the moves by the police in the UK completely undermine that.' Wiltshire officers asked at least three newsagents for people's details. The force apologised after admitting that an officer had taken down the names of four people in the town of Corsham who bought the magazine featuring a cartoon of the Prophet Mohammed on the front. Earlier this week David Jones, 63, was told by his local shop in Beddau, Pontypridd, that an officer had asked for his name after he bought a copy for his 21-year-old son, who studied French at university. He said: 'I am astounded that this intrusion has occurred and wonder what right the police have to check up on what I and others are reading. 'Surely their time would be better spent hunting deranged people who want to behead citizens on our streets.' He said his newsagent told him that anther stockist in a nearby town had also been asked about Charlie Hebdo customers. 'I cannot fathom out what link they think exists between a local person in a small town in South Wales, a satirical French magazine and some terrorists,' he said. 'Trust in the police is low and this type of official or unofficial snooping on private individuals will not improve the situation. They are acting like the Stasi.' Grandmother Ann Keat, 77, was also told by her newsagent in Corsham that police had asked for her name, and the names of others who had ordered Charlie Hebdo. The retired nurse said: 'I was cross – what's wrong with me wanting to buy it? It's an intrusion, and in terms of free speech it's worrying really.' Hundreds of Britons queued for a copy of the £3.50 souvenir edition of the magazine, published following last month's attack by Islamic extremists on its offices which left 12 people dead. Emma Carr, director of Big Brother Watch, said: 'The Charlie Hebdo attack brought millions of people worldwide together to condemn those who seek to silence free speech. Twelve people were killed when gunmen (pictured) stormed the office of Charlie Hebdo in Paris on January 7 . The Paris massacre led to an outpouring of support around the world, including the 'Je Suis Charlie' message . 'It is therefore alarming that overzealous police officers are attempting to find out who has bought a perfectly legal publication. We have to hope that these are isolated cases.' Shami Chakrabarti, director of human rights organisation Liberty, said the officers 'may have had good intentions, but the road to oppression is paved that way'. Wiltshire Police said it had carried out an 'assessment of community tensions' after the Paris attacks. As part of this, officers were asked to be 'mindful' of newsagents that were stocking the magazine. A spokesman said: 'A police officer visited a local shop and post office in Corsham to make an assessment of community tensions ... during this conversation the officer requested information about subscribers to the Charlie Hebdo magazine. 'Wiltshire Police would like to apologise to the members of public who may be affected. [This information] has been permanently and securely disposed of.' A spokesman for South Wales Police said they were 'not currently aware of anything regarding the incident'.","Wiltshire Police requested details of people who bought Charlie Hebdo .

"Whenever an endangered animal dies at the San Diego Zoo, researchers race out, regardless of the hour, to remove its sperm or eggs, maybe a bit of ear or eyeball, and carefully freeze the cells in liquid nitrogen. Today, the survival of the northern white rhinoceros and dozens of other species could hinge on the collection amassed over nearly 40 years that has become the largest gene bank of its kind: The Frozen Zoo. The icy vials may someday even be used in experiments to resurrect recently extinct animals, like the Hawaiian Po'ouli bird. The stainless steel tanks hold the genetic material of more than 10,000 individual animals from more than 1,000 species and subspecies. Scroll down for video . Futuristic: Barbara Durant, director of reproductive physiology at the San Diego Zoo Institute for Conservation Research, a.k.a. the Frozen Zoo, takes a peek at her stock . On a mission: Durant stands by a nitrogen-cooled stainless steel vat holding hundreds of vials of animal cells - The vats hold the genetic material of more than 10,000 animals from more than 1,000 species . The Frozen Zoo's work has taken on renewed urgency since the San Diego Safari Park lost 42-year-old Angalifu to cancer in December, leaving only five northern white rhinos left in the world - and all unable to reproduce. Scientists are racing against the clock to find the best way to utilize the bank's frozen sperm to produce another one before the northern white goes extinct, which could happen within a decade. Critics question whether it's worth spending millions of dollars on species that are down to so few. The bank is valued as a genetic archive that has helped advance artificial insemination, in vitro fertilization, cloning and stem cell technology. But debate is stirring over how far such research should go. 'The frozen zoo is basically re-arranging the deck chairs on the Titanic,' said Paul Ehrlich, a senior fellow at the Stanford Woods Institute for the Environment at Stanford University. He noted the world needs to address the problem's root causes, such as population growth and climate change. Process: Durant submerges a tray holding vials of cells into liquid nitrogen - The bank is valued as a genetic archive that has helped advance artificial insemination, in vitro fertilization, cloning and stem cell technology . Preservation: A small vial containing frozen animal cells is shown to the camera . 'Screwing around with science to save a white rhino might be fun and I would like to see it preserved and am all for biodiversity, but it's so far down the list of things we should be doing first,' he said. With species going extinct at a faster rate, zoos are taking on greater conservation roles and facing deciding which animals are worth focusing efforts on saving. Some may be extinct by the time another one is reproduced and possibly never live in the wild. The northern white's natural habitat is in war-torn countries like Sudan and Congo, which have been unable to stop poachers. The horn is coveted in Asia as an aphrodisiac, creating a market that threatens all rhino species. There's also the hurdle of producing enough offspring to avoid inbreeding. 'We can do all kinds of razzle dazzle things but it's one thing to make another animal or two or three, but it's quite another to make a sustainable population from a genetic standpoint,' said George Seidel, a Colorado State University professor who has written about resurrecting the woolly mammoth. The challenges, however, are not insurmountable for critically endangered species or possibly recently extinct species, said Barbara Durrant, director of reproductive physiology at The San Diego Zoo Institute for Conservation Research, which houses the Frozen Zoo. 'We're not so much interested in bringing back dinosaurs or mammoths,' she said. 'There's really no place for them now.' The Frozen Zoo holds the cell cultures from 12 northern white rhinos - more than the living population: . 'There have been other species that have come back from numbers that small so we think there is good reason we can do this with the northern white rhino,' she said. Sperm from the Frozen Zoo has been used in artificial insemination to reproduce endangered animals from the giant panda to the Chinese monal pheasant. Its frozen cells also were used to clone two endangered types of cattle. On the brink of extinction: The northern white's natural habitat is in war-torn countries like Sudan and Congo, which have been unable to stop poachers . In high demand: The rhino's horn is also coveted in Asia as an aphrodisiac (above, the only northern white left in the United States, 40-year-old Nola at the San Diego Zoo) The gaur lived only a few days while the banteng survived for seven years before being put down after breaking a leg. Both animals, however, had genetic defects. The northern white rhino and the drill monkey were the first endangered animals to have their cells transformed into stem cells and stored at the Frozen Zoo. Theoretically stem cells can produce any body tissue. That means thawed stem cells from a male rhino could produce both sperm and egg in the lab, but the method has been done only once - in a mouse. Artificial insemination has seen success in producing other rhino species. Northern white rhino semen could be used to impregnate the closely related southern white to make a hybrid. Scientists are also looking at in vitro fertilization but that technique has never been done on any rhino species. On a recent day, the only northern white left in the United States, 40-year-old Nola, munched on apples at the San Diego Safari Park. When she dies, there is talk of placing her in the Smithsonian so future generations can see a northern white rhino.","Whenever an endangered animal dies at the San Diego Zoo, researchers race out to remove its sperm or eggs .

"In their fresh-faced modelling heyday they were a familiar pairing on the party circuit. And more than two decades later, Claudia Schiffer and Helena Christensen appear to have barely aged at all. The original supermodels looked as super as ever at Monday's New York premiere of Kingsman: The Secret Service, which was directed by Miss Schiffer's husband Matthew Vaughn. Scroll down for video . Claudia Schiffer and Helena Christensen in their fresh-faced modelling heyday when they were among the 1990s supermodel elite . German-born Miss Schiffer, 44, now a mother of three, was there to support her British film director husband Matthew Vaughn. She showed off the slender physique she has managed to maintain in a leopard print mini dress. Miss Christensen, 46, who was raised in Denmark strutted her way into the star-studded bash, showing off her impressive model figure in a plunging black jumpsuit and gold shoes. The 1990s was the decade of the supermodel and both Miss Schiffer and Miss Christensen were among an elite eight who commanded the catwalk and magazine covers. Both women still dabble in modelling, but also devote much of their time to their families. The pair remain friends to this day and still as stunning as ever on a red carpet appearance for the premiere of the Kingsman . The pair were joined on the red carpet by a host of stars on the red carpet including Anna Wintour, Brooke Shields and Olivia Palmero. While the prmeiere attracted A listers in the dozens, one person who wasn't at the premiere however was Helena's Interpol frontman boyfriend Paul Banks. However, the couple have been together since 2008 and their romance is believed to be stronger than ever. Miss Schiffer has been married to Vaughn since 2002 and revealed last year she received an indecent proposal of £1million from an Arab prince at the height of her modelling career. She told Jonathan Ross: 'The strangest one was an Arab prince. He asked if he could hire me for a dinner for a million pounds. I declined, and some other supermodel took it. 'It's not all about money. I just want to be able to walk down the street and be proud of what I do.' Miss Schiffer and her husband have three children, while Miss Christensen – who is in a long-term relationship with rock musician Paul Banks – has a teenage son. The glamorous pair, here pictured at a David Copperfield Gala in Paris in 2004, have stayed friends for over two decades .","Claudia Schiffer and Helena Christensen were big on the 1990s party scene .

"Carl Singleton pictured with his girlfriend Ashley Agumbi, who he is accused of murdering by flushing her diabetic medicine down the toilet . A British man accused of murdering the girlfriend he met on Facebook by flushing her diabetic medicine down the toilet is due to stand trial tomorrow after being re-arrested in Kenya. Carl Singleton, 41, had been due to fly home last week after he was released without charge over the death of 22-year-old Ashley Agumbi. But he was arrested again last Thursday after prosecutors re-examined the case. Singleton is accused of flushing the insulin for Miss Agumbi's diabetes down the toilet. She died in hospital of diabetic hypertension and respiratory failure in November, days after making the accusations against him. The pair met two years earlier on Facebook and Mr Singleton flew out to Kenya to be with her six months before her death. Mr Singleton, a former van driver was originally arrested on November 23 by police in Gigiri, a suburb of the capital Nairobi. He had been released without charge in December pending an inquest into her death. However, the director of public prosecutions in Kenya revisited the case and made the decision to re-arrest him. He is due to stand trial tomorrow and has maintained his innocence throughout. Det Chief Inspector Daniel Kandie said: 'He has been arrested on suspicion of murder and will be on trial on February 12. 'It was the decision of the director of public prosecution. We are still carrying out investigations.' Mr Singleton's family said they spoke to him just two weeks ago and had been expecting him home this month. They said the first they heard of his re-arrest was from his legal team. His father, Norman Singleton, said: 'We talked to him about two weeks ago. We heard about it when a solicitor rang us. We had been expecting him home.' Miss Agumbi, who was studying on Lower Kabete campus at the University of Nairobi, died in hospital on November 19. Allegations: Miss Agumbi died in hospital of diabetic hypertension and respiratory failure in November days after making accusations that Singleton had flushed her insulin down the toilet . Singleton spent 11 days in a Nairobi jail cell before he appeared in court in front of magistrate Hannah Kaguru on Wednesday, December 3, and was released. He met his girlfriend Ashley Agumbi online through Facebook two years ago before flying out with a tourist visa to meet the University of Nairobi student six months ago. A Foreign and Commonwealth Office spokesman said: 'We can confirm the arrest of a British national in Kenya on February 5. We are providing consular assistance.' Last December, Mr Singleton told of his nightmare stay in a Kenyan prison. He described the ordeal in which he slept on the jail floor as 'hell'. Accused: Singleton spent 11 days in a Nairobi jail last year after his first arrest. He was released without charge after appearing before a magistrate in December, but was re-arrested last week and now faces trial . He said: 'I was just shocked at first when I was arrested. I was in jail for 11 days that was hell, had to sleep on the floor, just one drink a day and one meal a day. 'You sleep on the floor and the jail was so dirty. No shower for 11 days or a shave.' The 6ft 6in, 20-stone former van driver, added: 'I was not given much food just ugali (a dish of maize flour cooked with water to a porridge). I lost about two stone in 11 days.' He also said he was only allowed to use the phone once to call his family. He said: 'I was just upset because I lost the love of my life. But I had to stay strong for my family back home. We were so much in love with each other.' Speaking of the accusation that he killed his girlfriend, he added: 'It felt bad when she was my world, my life, my everything.' He also said when he met her he 'knew it was love'. He added: 'I was so happy when I saw her at the airport. As soon as I saw her I knew she loved me. She was a very kind and caring young lady.'","Carl Singleton was released without charge in December after first arrest .

"A man allegedly shot dead three Muslim students execution-style near to the University of North Carolina campus on Tuesday after posting anti-religious sentiments online. Craig Stephen Hicks, 46, shot dentistry student Deah Shaddy Barakat, 23, his new wife Yusor Mohammad, 21, and her sister Razan Mohammad Abu-Salha, 19, in their heads over an ongoing parking dispute at their quiet condominium complex in Chapel Hill around 5pm, police said. But the women's father, Dr. Mohammad Abu-Salha, said even though parking might have triggered the killings, Hicks had long targeted the family because of their religion and culture. 'It was execution style, a bullet in every head,' Abu-Salha told the News Observer. 'This was not a dispute over a parking space, this was a hate crime. Scroll down for video . In court: Craig Hicks, 46, is pictured as he enters the courtroom for his first appearance at the Durham County Detention Center on Wednesday - a day after he allegedly shot three young students to death . Cuffed: Hicks, who has been charges with three counts of first-degree murder and is being held without bond, shot the trio dead amid an ongoing parking dispute, according to preliminary investigations . 'This man had picked on my daughter and her husband a couple of times before, and he talked with them with his gun in his belt. And they were uncomfortable with him, but they did not know he would go this far.' Dr Abu-Salha, who has one other child, added that police told him Hicks shot the three inside their apartment. Hicks, who is married, turned himself in 'without incident' after the killings and is currently being held in Durham County jail on three counts of first-degree murder. On Wednesday morning, he kept his head down as he appeared in an orange jumpsuit at the Durham County Detention Center. He is being held without bond. Police say that he is cooperating, and that their preliminary investigation showed that the parking dispute was the motive. There have also been questions over whether Hicks' anti-religious stance - which he freely shared on social media - had also been a factor in the murders. On a Facebook page in his name, Hicks shared a number of anti-religion posts. A banner about 'anti-theism' is prominent on his page. Hicks posted a photo from United Atheists of America on February 8, which has the title 'why radical Christians and radical Muslims are so opposed to each others' influence when they agree about so many ideological issues'.

On the page he is listed as married and having studied to become a paralegal at Durham Technical Community College. Records show his wife works at UNC Hospital. Most of the pictures he has posted in recent months criticize a number of religions, including Christianity. Other recent pictures he has published include one of a loaded revolver. In one post allegedly written by Hicks and shared by CNN, he wrote: 'When it comes to insults, your religion started this, not me. If your religion kept its big mouth shut, so would I.' Craig Hicks has been charged with murdering the three Muslim students after handing himself in . Police were called to Summerwalk Circle after shots were heard at about 5.10pm on Tuesday. When they arrived they found three people dead. They had been shot in the head, CNN reported. According to their Facebook pages, Mr Barakat had married his wife just over a month ago and was a second year student at the dental school at the University of North Carolina. The last picture on his Facebook page, posted on January 29, said he helped provide free dental supplies to 75 homeless people in downtown Durham. The couple had organised an online fundraiser to get dental care to refugees from Syria, raising around $15,000 - but after news of their deaths, the total reached more than $23,000 . Mr Barakat was due to travel to Turkey in the summer to treat children who have become refugees following the civil war. Last month, he tweeted: 'It's so freaking sad to hear people saying we should 'kill Jews' or 'Kill Palestinians'. As if that's going to solve anything SMH [shaking my head].' His sister-in-law Razan Mohammad Abu-Salha had been studying for a degree at North Carolina State University in Architecture and Environmental Design. After their deaths, Barakat's brother Farris paid tribute to the trio on Facebook as he struggled to comprehend the killings. Outspoken: A Facebook page in Hicks' name clearly displays anti-religious sentiments . Hicks, pictured in an image he shared to Facebook, identified himself as an atheist on social media . Last December, he shared this picture showing him and his 'better half' Karen during a trip to Disneyland . Armed: Two weeks ago he shared this image of his 'loaded 38 revolver, its holster and five extra rounds' 'It doesn't make sense,' he wrote, 'and for that I rely on the Most Wise. It hurts and for that I know that God will not burden me more than I can handle. 'I know my brother, his wife, and his sister in law are together as ultimate winners. This life was only ever a test and they have passed with flying colors... 'I haven't even begun to fully comprehend what has happened. But I know for sure those three together have done so much we are all proud of. No reason to stop being proud now.' He added: 'We live as Muslims to die as Muslims. May Allah enter them to the highest of paradise.' Following news of the deaths a hashtag #MuslimLivesMatter started trending on Twitter. Burcu Bozcurt wrote: 'Hate will not prevail. Three beautiful souls taken, but examples of their love & impact on others abounds. #MuslimLivesMatter #chapelhill' And MohaNNad said: 'Remember them like this. Deah and Yusor had names, dreams and families. #MuslimLivesMatter.' The couple are only thought to have been married for just a month and were fundraising for Syrian refugees . People posted pictures of the couple, newly married, on Twitter just hours after they were both murdered . Well-known atheist Richard Dawkins also condemned the killings on Twitter. He said: 'How could any decent person NOT condemn the vile murder of three young US Muslims in Chapel Hill?' People called for action to be taken with some speculating that the attack could have been religiously motivated. A Facebook tribute page has been set up for the victims, called 'Our Three Winners'. It says: 'Deah Barakat, Yusor Abu-Salha and Razan Abu-Salha have returned to their Lord. They have set an example in life and in death.' It noted that funeral arrangements will be announced after they receive news from the medical examiner, who will carry out an investigation and release the bodies. The shooting took place in the Finley Forest complex - a typically quiet area home to students. Bethany Boring encountered police cars, crime scene tape and people upset in the street when she went to walk her dog. She told WRAL: 'It's a very quiet community. It's a lot of graduate and professional students. You know, professional's families.' People have posted tributes to the trio on Twitter, with the hashtag #MuslimLivesMatter following the deaths . People living near Summerwalk Circle said the area was usually very quiet with little or no crime reported . Daniel Waggoner who lives in the area added: 'I'm up late. I come home late and it's always quiet when I get here,' he said. 'So I mean yeah, it's surprising.' A campus crime alert from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill was sent to students. The complex is located near campus. About two hours after the shooting a group of young people arrived at the scene and sat on the pavement, apparently waiting for news of the names of the people who had been killed. Police later turned away people in tears, claiming to be relatives. The Chapel Hill Police Department said in a statement there was 'reason to believe that there is no ongoing threat to the public'. The school added in a statement: 'We are sensitive to the impact an incident of this nature has on campus and in the community. 'We understand you want to know the facts as quickly as possible. At the same time, we must respect the job our Chapel Hill police have as they investigate this crime.'","Craig Hicks, 46, has been charged with the murders of three Muslim students near the UNC campus in Chapel Hill on Tuesday .

"An Arizona baby who has born seven weeks premature has successfully undergone a heart transplant at just six days old - and is believed to be the youngest person in the nation to do so. The parents of baby Oliver, Caylyn Otto and Chris Crawford, say they feared the worst, after their son was diagnosed with dilated cardiomyopathy during a 20-week scan. The Mesa couple were told there was a serious possibility Oliver would be stillborn, and if he did survive he would need a heart transplant to live. Then the situation worsened during a 28-week checkup, with a scan showing Oliver's left ventricle was seven times the size of a healthy 28-week-old's left ventricle, AZ Central reported. Survivor: Oliver, who was born at 33-weeks-old, was not expected to survive the delivery because of his pre-diagnosed heart condition, but went on to undergo and survive a heart transplant at six-days-old . Caylyn and Chris were told to prepare for the worst, and the two started preparing for their unborn baby's funeral. However doctors at Phoenix Children's Hospital refused to give up. They decided to deliver Oliver at 36 weeks, believing that would be his best chance at qualifying for a heart transplant. However at 33 weeks Caylyn woke in the middle of the night screaming - her waters had broken. She was rushed to to Banner Good Samaritan Medical Center in Phoenix, where she begged doctors to delay her delivery, knowing she had to wait as long as possible. Doctors could only push the birth back a few days, and Oliver was born at 33-weeks-old. Prayers: Mom Caylyn Otto did not expect her son to survive, and had even planned his funeral while she was pregnant . Fighter: Doctors at Phoenix Children's Hospital have described Oliver as a miracle . Oliver was put under strict observation, as doctors assessed whether he was healthy enough for a heart transplant. On Friday January 9 they put him on the national waiting list, and because of his size he automatically went to the top. By Sunday afternoon a heart had become available, and Oliver was taken into surgery at midnight. The operation lasted over 10 hours, but Oliver survived. Having been over a month, doctors are pleased to report that Oliver's body has not rejected the heart he received. The doctors are astonished. 'I do feel there was something miraculous that happened with this child,' Dr. Christopher Lindblade told AZ Central. Family: Chris Crawford and Caylyn Otto are seen here with other son . Mom: Caylyn Otto feared the worst after their son was diagnosed with dilated cardiomyopathy during a 20-week scan . However they do not know when he will be allowed home. Caylyn said she wants to thank Oliver's doctors for what they did for him. 'They never gave up hope, and we're so grateful for that,' she said. Officials at the hospital say that Oliver is the youngest person in the United States to have undergone a heart transplant.","Oliver was diagnosed with dilated cardiomyopathy during a 20-week scan .

"An experimental spaceplane has successfully launched after a minor delay. Esa launched its unmanned Intermediate Experimental Vehicle (IXV) on a Vega rocket from Kourou in South America at 1340 GMT today. The initial launch was postponed after an unidentified problem with the launch complex. It is now on a flight that will last slightly more than 100 minutes, during which time it will re-enter Earth's atmosphere to test new technologies. The craft is being fired 256 miles (412km) into the Earth's atmosphere in the first test flight of technology that could lead to new re-usable spacecraft for use on future missions to Mars. Scroll down for video . The launch of an experimental spaceplane has taken place, after a minor delay due to an unidentified problem with the launch complex. Esa launched its unmanned Intermediate Experimental Vehicle (IXV) on a Vega rocket from South America at 1340 GMT today (still image from live stream video shown) The 16ft (five metres) long spaceplane separated from the Vega rocket at an altitude of 210 miles (340km) above the Earth before climbing to its maximum altitude. It is due to fly east for around 20,000 miles (32,000km) during the 100-minute long test flight before re-entering the atmosphere at a rapid 16,800mph (27 000 km/h). During this time it will navigate through the atmosphere using 'flaps' at its back, controlling its re-entry in a way not possible for capsules that return from space. If it passes this test, it will then splash down in the Pacific Ocean at the end of the flight. IXV will be launched into a suborbital path by a Vega rocket launched from Europe’s Spaceport in French Guiana in February 11. IXV will separate from Vega at an altitude of 210 miles (340 km). IXV will coast to up to 256 miles (412km) and then begin its re-entry phase, recording a vast amount of data from a large number of conventional and advanced sensors. The entry speed of 4.6 miles per second (7.5 km/s) at an altitude of 75 miles (120 km) will create the same conditions as those for a vehicle returning from low orbit. IXV will glide through the atmosphere at hypersonic speeds to test new re-entry technologies before parachutes deploy to slow the descent for a splashdown in the Pacific. Engineers at Esa hope to use the craft, which looks like a shrunken space shuttle without wings, to develop new ways of returning cargo and astronauts safely to Earth. It could also help scientists develop spacecraft that can land safely on the surface of Mars in future missions and then return samples to Earth. Gerogio Tumino, Esa project manager for the IXV, said: 'Reentry is something we need to achieve if one day we want to have the ambition of having astronauts flying back to Earth with European technologies.' IXV will glide through the atmosphere at hypersonic speeds to test new European re-entry technologies before parachutes deploy to slow the descent for a safe splashdown in the Pacific Ocean. The Nos Aries recovery vessel will be used to retrieve the spacecraft. Over the last month, the crew have been testing the equipment for hoisting IXV out of the water. The 16ft (five metres) long spaceplane separated from the Vega rocket (shown just after launch) at an altitude of 210 miles (340km) above the Earth before climbing to its maximum altitude. It is due to fly east for around 20,000 miles (32,000km) during the 100-minute long test flight before re-entering the atmosphere . The two-piece shell of Vega opened to release the space plane at an altitude of about 200 miles (320 km). Pictured is an artist's impression of various stage of the test flight . Developed over five years at a cost of 150 million euros ($225 million), the IXV is the testbed for a reusable vehicle that may one day be able to land on a conventional runway on Earth after a mission to space. This could be useful for bringing astronauts back from the International Space Station (ISS). The only craft currently able to ferry astronauts to the ISS and back is Russia's Soyuz. Speaking to the BBC, Mr Tumino said: 'Europe is excellent at going to orbit; we have all the launchers, for example. 'We also have great knowhow in operating complex systems in orbit. But where we are a bit behind is in the knowledge of how to come back from orbit. 'So, if we are to close the circle - go to orbit, stay in orbit, come back from orbit - this third leg we need to master as well as other spacefaring nations.' Engineers at Esa hope to use the craft (illustration shown), which looks like a shrunken space shuttle without wings, to develop new ways of returning cargo and astronauts safely to Earth. It could also help scientists develop spacecraft that can land safely on the surface of Mars in future missions and return samples to Earth . Scientists have filled the IXV with sensors to monitor how the materials and flight systems cope during the launch. After separating from the spacerocket, the IXV was travelling at hypersonic speeds of 9,562mph (15,389km/h). It  climbed further through the atmosphere before lowering and dipping its nose to begin re-entry. During the descent, the heat shields designed to protect the spaceplne will reach temperatures of up to 1,700 degrees C (3,100 degree F) Flaps and thrusters will help control the vehicle as it descends, ensuring it comes down at a pre-arranged landing site. Just before landing a parachute system will deploy to allow the two tonne vechile to land gently in the Pacific Ocean where airbags will deploy to keep it from sinking. A recovery ship will be waiting nearby - around 1,800 miles west of the coast of the Galapagos Islands. As it makes its way through the atmosphere, IXV will use 'flaps' at its back to control its re-entry in a way not possible for capsules that return from space, such as Nasa's recent Orion spacecraft. If it passes this test, it will then splash down in the Pacific Ocean at the end of the flight . Last year Esa used a prototype of the IXV to practice recovering it from the ocean. An attempt to launch the IXV last November was postponed by engineers to allow additional analysis of the rockets trajectory to be conducted. Last year saw two major setbacks for the space industry. On October 28, an Orbital Sciences Antares rocket exploded shortly after launch on what was to be a supply mission to the ISS. This was followed three days later by the crash of Virgin Galactic tourist space plane SpaceShipTwo on a test flight, killing one of two pilots.

"He's just been named Britain's most mischievous toddler. And two-year-old Sonny Greer - also known as the 'wall scrawler' - has certainly earned his title. His mother Karla, 29, from Barton-le-Clay, Bedfordshire, entered a picture of Sonny's black marker handiwork to a competition looking for the naughtiest tot in the UK. Mother Karla entered this picture of Sonny's militant handiwork which won him the competition . The little two-year-old loves using permanent marker to decorate the walls, furniture - and himself . The image demonstrates the boy's ability to  make a 'complete mess' of Karla's bedroom, scribbling all over the walls and bedding in permanent black marker pen - as well as drawing all over himself. Customer services manager Karla, said she took the photo just minutes after waking up and finding her son had 're-decorated her room' while she was relaxing. She said Sonny created the 'disaster zone' after she put him in her own bed when he woke up crying in the middle of the night. But as Karla dozed, the cheeky toddler got out of bed and found the marker pen in his mother's bedside drawer before getting to work. Karla woke up finding her son had 're-decorated her room' while she was relaxing . When Karla woke up she found her son sitting on the bed looking 'like butter wouldn't melt' - with the bedroom covered in black ink. Mother-of-one Karla said: 'It was 8pm and Sonny wasn't going to sleep, so I went up to comfort him. 'I fell asleep and woke up an hour later to find him awake and covered in permanent marker. 'He'd found it in my bedside drawer and proceeded to create a masterpiece all over himself, my bed and my walls.' She added: 'The amazing thing is he didn't draw on me - he obviously thought I would tell him off for that. I was literally speechless, I couldn't decide whether to cry or scream.' The entry narrowly beat one showing three kids  covered in foam after squeezing a bottle of washing up liquid into their jacuzzi - which only just lost out as the kids are not officially toddlers. Karla woke up to find Sonny sitting on the bed looking 'like butter wouldn't melt' While Karla appreciates that Sonny is 'very artistic' - his hobby costs her dearly in 'little accidents' Karla said she was going to re-decorate the wall 'when she has the time', but that she had to throw away the bedsheet - which she said was 'ruined'. She said Sonny was 'very artistic' and loves drawing at nursery, but that he costs her hundreds of pounds a year in 'little accidents'. Among the 'accidents' include dropping her smartphone in his 'full potty' and then hurling his mum's replacement phone into the bath just weeks later - as well as clambering into the washing machine and painting the floor with yogurt. After being awarded the top prize for Britain's most mischievous toddler by organisers Time4Sleep, an online bed retailer, she said: 'I can't say I'm surprised he was voted Britain's most mischievous toddler - he certainly keeps me entertained on a daily basis. Karla said: 'When my cousin told me about the competition I knew exactly which picture to send in. 'I remember showing people at the time and the reaction was priceless.' Karla and Sonny, who is three in May, can now choose a family day out of their choice in the UK. 1. WALL SCRAWLER: Sonny Greer, (above) of Barton-le-Clay, Beds. 2. JACUZZI FILLED WITH WASHING UP LIQUID: Iris, six, and five-year-old twins Honor and Edie squirted a bottle of washing up liquid into the jacuzzi at the family home in Thirsk, North Yorkshire. Mum Dianne Kinghorn, who submitted the photo, said: 'Has anyone seen the washing up liquid?' 3. CHOCCY MESS: Twins Matthew and Ethan Griffiths, who were nearly two when the photo was taken, are shown covered in chocolate after splattering it around the kitchen table. Mum Hollie and Dad Chris sent in the snap at their home on the Isle of Wight accompanied by the caption 'That Chocolate Picture', with Hollie adding: 'I literally popped upstairs to get something and came down to this - the chocolate pudding was everywhere...and as the picture shows my cheeky monkeys were quite surprised when mummy told them off!' 4. DOWN THE LOO: Jayden Richardson, 20 months, was photographed by mum Jemma after he fell down the loo at his home in Bournemouth. Mum Jemma, who sent in the photo, said he told her 'I just wanted another bath mummy'. 5. BED WRECKER: Fabio, two, wrecked his bed after telling mum Lisa Bennett he wanted a 'bigger bed' like his elder brother. Lisa, of Corfe Mullen in Dorset, - who sent in the photo - said: 'My toddler took his bed apart and trashed his room every morning until he got a big boy bed like his big brother.' As voted for by members of the public and judges at Time4Sleep . He narrowly beat three kids covered in foam after squeezing a bottle of washing up liquid into the jacuzzi . A poll by of 1,000 parents for Time4Sleep found that carpets, walls and chairs were the most damaged household items by kids and that most were caused by spillages and drawing. It found that little girls were the messiest, with 56 per cent saying their daughters were the most trouble. A total of 22 per cent of those parents quizzed said they spent up to five hours a week cleaning up after their toddler - with five per cent saying they ended up forking out more than £1,000-a-year to repair the damage. A spokesperson said: 'We had an incredible response to our search for the most mischievous toddler, with almost 200 entries. 'From tots down the toilet to painting the dog, we all had our favourites, but Sonny's handiwork was a clear winner. 'Household items often bear the brunt of young children when they're in the mood for mischief, so we wanted to find out just how much they're costing mum and dad in time and money. 'The amount of time parents are spending on repairing damage is surprising, but we're sure it doesn't take long to forgive some of those angelic faces'","Sonny Greer, two, from Barton-le-Clay, Bedfordshire, is named naughtiest .

"They might be ruthless ambush killers that can tear chunks off their prey with their powerful jaws, but crocodiles have a softer side too. Biologists have compiled evidence that shows crocodiles like to have fun by playing in streams, surfing currents, pushing sticks and riding on each other's backs. The reptiles also appear to prefer objects that are pink in colour and have even been known to form bonds with other animals and play with them. Scroll down for more video . The findings reveal a surprisingly fun-loving side to these animals that have a reputation for lurking in the depths of rivers waiting for a moment to pounce. Crocodiles and alligators have an surprising talent  for tree climbing. Researchers have discovered the reptiles, more usually found in the water, could climb as high as five metres. They claim that the animals are 'spectacularly agile' on land. Dr Vladimir Dinets, from the University of Tennessee, observed crocodile species climbing trees on three continents - Australia, Africa and North America. He said that he believes crocodiles use climbing to regulate their heat by allowing them to bask out of the water. He believes the animals may also climb trees to get a better view while on some occassions use it as a way to escape. Crocodiles are surprisingly agile on land and can even climb into the branches of trees as above . Dr Vladimir Dinets, a researcher at the University of Tennessee in Knoxville who led the study, found examples of playing in 10 different species of crocodile and alligator. He used a combination of his own observations while studying more general crocodile behaviour along with reports of playing in the animals. He said the further work on the social and playful side of crocodiles may help to shed more light on their intelligence. He said: 'Many aspects of crocodilian behavior remain poorly known due to their rare occurrence and to the difficulty of observing predominantly nocturnal predators. 'In the case of play, an additional problem appears to be that people witnessing such behavior consider their observations unworthy of publishing or unlikely to be taken seriously.' In a paper published in the journal of Animal Behaviour and Cognition, Dr Dinets describes how young captive alligators have been observed repeatedly sliding down slopes into water while broad-snouted caiman surfed in water from an inflow pipe into their pool. Others have been seen in zoos to repeatedly swim into showers from small waterfalls in their enclosures, snapping at the water as they past. Crocodiles have also been observed 'surfing' on waves off the coast of Australia. Dr Dinets also describes how one male crocodile at Toledo Zoo was seen pushing around balls floating in his enclosure. He said he has also seen adult crocodiles in the wild and in captivity pushing twigs, grass and other floating vegetation while swimming. Dr Dinets said: 'In many cases this behavior appears to be accidental, but on two occasions I have seen crocodilians doing this in a manner strongly suggesting play. 'In both cases, the objects were pink Bougainvillea flowers that were floating in the pools where the animals were kept captive.' This large captive male crocodile was seen giving a smaller female piggy back rides around their enclosure . Researchers have found that crocodiles appear to enjoy playing with pink flowers like the one above . He said that in one example an adult male Cuban crocodile in Miami Zoo, Florida, picked up the flowers, pushed them around and carried them in its teeth or on the tip of his snout. Dr Dinets added: 'Anecdotal observations suggest that crocodilians are generally attracted to small pink objects, and prefer them over similar objects of other colors for biting and manipulating.' He said that in one example an adult male Cuban crocodile in Miami Zoo, Florida, picked up the flowers, pushed them around and carried them in its teeth or on the tip of his snout. Dr Dinets added: 'Anecdotal observations suggest that crocodilians are generally attracted to small pink objects, and prefer them over similar objects of other colors for biting and manipulating.' In another recent piece of research reported that wild crocodiles balance sticks on their snouts, which helped them to lure birds to them. Some researchers have reported that crocodiles play with their prey, much like killer whales have been seen to do in the wild. Recently a photographer captured a large Nile crocodile tossing the body of a baby hippo though the air in what has been interpreted as play. Dr Dinets said that crocodiles have also been seen to play together, with juveniles chasing and tussling with each other in the water. Dr Dinets said that he has also witnessed a pair of Cuban crocodiles perform 'a particularly unusual behavior'. Unchanged since the time of the dinosaur, crocodiles like the one above are the perfect ambush predator, but it seems these notoriously solitary creatures may have a more social side that includes having fun . He said: 'The female would get on the back of the larger male, and he would give her a few rides around the pool.' He said he has seen similar behaviour in American alligators where a younger animal took short rides on the back of an older one. Crocodiles have also been known to form strong bonds with humans and play with them in the water. Gilberto Shedden, from Costa Rica, rescued an American crocodile after it had been shot and the pair became famous for playing together. The crocodile would sneak up behind Mr Sheddon and pretend to charge him while it also allowed him to caress, hug and rotate it in the water. Dr Dinets said he also witnessed an Amercian alligator that appeared to be playing with a river otter in Big Cypress National Preserve in Florida. This large captive crocodile at Toledo Zoo, called Maximo, regularly plays with a large ball in his enclosure . He said: 'The otters would often harass the alligators by approaching them closely, nipping on their tail tips, and splashing water onto their heads. 'Most alligators responded to harassment by submerging, but one individual about 1.5 m long responded by lunging at the otters every time they got close. 'By the third day of observation the otters focused most of their attention on that individual. 'On one occasion an otter slipped on a steep bank of the bayou and was grabbed across . the chest by the alligator. 'The alligator retreated from the bank and pulled the wriggling otter underwater as if attempting to drown it, but after about 5 seconds raised its head and released the otter, apparently unharmed. 'The interactions between this alligator and the otters then continued for two more days.'","Biologist Vladimir Dinets spent years studying the behaviour of crocodiles .

"Buster Douglas, whose defeat of heavyweight boxer Mike Tyson ranks as one of the greatest upsets of all time, said that his motivation for the fight stemmed from his mother's belief in him. Mr Douglas, who was a heavy underdog against Mr Tyson, said that his mother Lula Pearl had told him she thought he could win before she died of a stroke three weeks before the fight. Mr Tyson, heavyweight champion of the world, was 37-0 at the time and favored at 42-1 odds to crush his opponent when they faced off in Tokyo, Japan. Six-foot-four-inch Mr Douglas knocked him out in the 10th round. Scroll down for video . Buster Douglas, 29 (center), shocked the world when he knocked out heavyweight champion Mike Tyson in the 10th round of a Feb 11, 2015, fight . Mr Tyson (left) was favored to win the Tokyo, Japan, fight by odds of 42 to 1, and few believed in Mr Douglas (right) besides his own mother . Mr Tyson, a  soft-spoken but ferocious 5ft10in fighter, was thought to be tuning up for his match with Evander Holyfield, whose ear he would later bite in his most notorious fight. When the Associated Press reminded Mr Douglas that few believed in him, he talked about his mother and said, 'Yeah, but she did.' 'I believed in myself and that I had the ability to do that. It's something that my mother instilled in me at a very young age: You can do whatever you want,' he said. Mr Douglas shocked the world when he won the fight despite still grieving the loss of his mother. Someone from the crowd told the young man to win the fight for Ms Pearl right before the match. Mr Tyson struggled to get up after being knocked down in the tenth round, but was unable to before ten seconds expired . 'He planned on doing a lot of things for her after this fight coming up. He was always thinking of her,' Mr Douglas's trainer and maternal uncle J.D. McCauley said in an obituary for his sister before the Tyson match. The 29-year-old hung in the ring with the shorter Tyson during the opening rounds by fending him off with his jab. However Mr Douglas's Cinderella story was almost ended prematurely when he was knocked down late in the eighth round. 'He ended up catching me with a good shot. When I got up off the ground, I knew I had to get back on focus, on point, with what I was doing,' Mr Douglas, now 54, said. He retaliated by dominating the ninth round as Mr Tyson suffered with a swollen left eye. Mr Douglas was knocked down in the eighth round (left), but was able to get back up and dominate the rest of the fight . Mr Douglas knocking his opponent out one minute and 22 seconds into the 10th round with a quick combination of what he called 'four terrific shots'. Though Mr Tyson's camp would dispute the result later based on the timing of Mr Douglas's eighth-round fall, the young man from Columbus, Ohio, had accomplished the impossible and handed the champ his first professional defeat. Mr Douglas's reign as the world's top heavyweight didn't last long, however, and he was knocked out by Evander Holyfield in a Las Vegas fight eight months later. He earned $7million from the unsuccessful defense, enough to live on comfortably. His body began worsening, and he almost died in the mid from a diabetic coma after allegedly ballooning to 400lbs. He also suffered from depression, according to ESPN. 'I was distraught. I was just in a shell. No one could understand my plight. I lost my best friend, my mother. I had really no one to turn to,' the fighter said. After being hospitalized he lost weight and made a comeback attempt in the late 90s before retiring from professional fighting in 1999 with a record of 38-6-1. Now slimmer and in middle age, Mr Douglas lives outside of Columbus. He trains young boxers five days a week and also spends time with his four sons and wife Bertha. The coach said that he has only run into his opponent once since their match, a few years ago in Cincinnati. 'It's not like we sat down and talked about it and (became) friends, anything like that. He was still kind of short (with me). So I didn't push it any further,' he said. The heavyweight said that he has watched the fight on video more than 50 times, though he likes to watch it alone, according to The Japan Times. 'When I just have time to myself, I pop it in and check it out,' he said. 'The thing about it is the emotions that I was going through at the time,' Mr Douglas added. Mr Douglas, now 54, lives outside of Columbus, Ohio, and teaches boxing to kids five days a week . The fighter earned $7million from his unsuccessful title defense against Evander Holyfield and moved back near his hometown . At one point Mr Douglas's weight neared 400lbs, but the boxer slimmed down before a comeback in the late 90s and now teaches the sport .","Mr Tyson favored by 42-1 when he faced Mr Douglas on Feb 11, 1990 .

"A sex abuse victim who was forced by his neighbour to act out Kama Sutra scenes when he was just nine years old has finally received justice after he bumped into his grinning abuser more than 30 years later. Taxi driver Guy Beadle, 45, was abused at the hands of Barry Rosamund, then 15, who would hold his victim in a headlock, before forcing him to carry out sickening acts as he cried for mercy. The father-of-two, from Beckenham, south London, always kept what happened a secret but was traumatised by the abuse his entire life. Justice: Guy Beadle, 45 (pictured left) reported his abuser Barry Rosamund (right) to police three decades after being abused - after he bumped into him on the street in London . But, in 2012,  Mr Beadle unexpectedly walked past Rosamund in the street. Sickeningly, Rosamund grinned at Mr Beadle, as if nothing had happened. The incident infuriated Mr Beadle so much that he told his mother about the abuse, before reporting it to police. Last year, Rosamund, of Looe, Cornwall, was finally convicted of four counts of indecent assault, one of attempted buggery and one of indecency with a child. He said: 'It's nothing compared to the 37-year sentence I've served, but I now know I did the right thing by reporting him. 'The monster had just smiled at me as if nothing had happened. It made me sick to my stomach. It made me realise how much destruction it has caused all through my life - all because of him. 'Now Barry is paying for what he did and, hopefully, he'll never be able to abuse another child again.' The abuse began when Mr Beadle, then nine, was living a few doors away from Rosamund, who was a friend of Mr Beadle's older brother, Mark. Mr Beadle, pictured as a child, was just nine years old when the abuse began . When Rosamund began inviting Mr Beadle over to play along with his brother, he was thrilled to have a new, older friend. He was also fascinated by all the state-of-the art toys Rosamund had at his home, something Mr Beadle and his brothers never had. He said: 'I remember looking around Barry Rosamund's front room. I felt like I'd just stepped into Aladdin's cave. 'Barry asked me what I wanted to have a go on. It was every nine-year-old boy's dream. It was like another world. I felt so grateful he didn't mind me tagging along.' But the abuse started when Rosamund asked Mr Beadle to visit his house alone. On that first occasion, Rosamund asked Mr Beadle to touch him - and gave him £3 when he did. 'He said we could play table football. I left Gary and Mark behind and went to Barry's on my own. 'His mum was in the kitchen. But as we started playing the footie game in the living room something odd happened. 'He asked me to touch him intimately. I supposed it was normal and didn't want to be seen like a baby so did it. Afterwards he gave me £3. I thought it was what lads did.' Another afternoon, Rosamund forced Mr Beadle onto his knees and made him perform a sex act on him. 'Once he'd finished with me, he'd give me money and let me go. He threatened to kill me if I told anyone,' he said. 'I felt so worthless, but I was just a frightened child, didn't know what to do.' Mr Beadle said that he would beg Rosamund to stop, but the abuse continued. He said: 'Most of the time we played in his bedroom. It would always end with Barry forcing me to touch him as I cried. 'He even had a calendar of the Kama Sutra and would make me pick positions from it to try. Then he'd violently wrestle me into the pose. 'If I refused he'd put me in a headlock, choke me until I almost passed out. So I went along with it.' Mr Beadle, from Beckenham, (pictured left and right) has been left traumatised by the abuse he suffered . Then, when Mr Beadle was just ten, Rosamund tried to rape him. He said: 'I was in agony. I somehow managed to fight him off. I made a decision there and then. 'I was going to stay away from Barry Rosamund. So I began taking the long way to school and avoided Barry's house. I stopped playing out with my friends, just in case he walked by.' Soon after, Rosamund moved away to Cornwall. Although Mr Beadle was relived, he was plagued by what had happened. When he was 19, he met a woman, with whom he had twin daughters. But that relationship soon broke down. After another failed relationship, Mr Beadle moved back in with his mother. He said: 'My memories chained me to the past. They made me feel foolish and dirty. 'I tried to start again and aged 19, I met a girl and we had twin daughters. The four of us should've been so happy but I couldn't forget my childhood. 'It affected me so much more than I thought. I just couldn't get close to anyone.' The whole time, Mr Beadle was burdened by what had happened, unable to speak with anyone about it, even his mother. 'I'd never told her the truth,' he said. 'I was terrified it would kill her, knowing she had failed to protect me from the predator on our doorstep.' But everything changed when Mr Beadle was walking along the road in 2012 and bumped into Rosamund. The attacker had come to visit a former neighbour on the street on which the pair used to live. He grinned at his victim as he walked past the driveway. Rosamund even parked his campervan right outside Mr Beadle's home. 'I was so furious. It was awful,' Mr Beadle said, 'Especially when he parked his campervan outside my mum's. 'I remember pacing up and down the living room, not knowing what to do. Then I stuck a note on his campervan, threatening him to go away. I just wanted him to go.' A few months later, Mr Beadle decided to tell his mother about what had happened. Unable to talk about it, he left her a letter instead. He said: 'She was distraught. My mum was a tough woman, from the era of ""just plough on"", but this stopped her in her tracks. 'I wrote a note because I could not tell her. Then I went out for an hour, saw the letter had been read and she was sat there with her head in her hands. 'I wanted her to understand me. It's not an excuse, but I just wanted to understand why I was how I was.' Knowing the stress any court case would have on her, Mr Beadle vowed only to go to the police after she died. Two months later, she died suddenly from a massive brain aneurysm. 'They said there was no way of knowing but I thought the stress of knowing what Barry had done had probably killed mum,' Mr Beadle said. In September 2014 Rosamund, then 50, appeared at Croydon Crown Court charged with four counts of indecent assault, one of attempted buggery and one of indecency with a child. He pleaded not guilty but was convicted and jailed for three years . He said: 'It was horrific, standing up in that dock, being accused of making it up. It's just not a nice thing to face. 'I did not even have a screen because I wanted to face him - I wanted him to see the damage he had done to me. And I wanted to give it back. 'But now I can start moving on, trying to repair the damage he has done. I only wish I had reported him earlier.'","Guy Beadle, 45, was just nine when he began being abused by neighbour .

"A lawyer who helped Shrien Dewani walk free from charges relating to the honeymoon murder of his bride, has been secured to represent a 20 year old South African who survived an axe massacre of his family. Henri van Breda was treated for minor injuries following the brutal triple murder of his parents and older brother. His 16 year old sister is fighting for her life with a round the clock police guard. According to reports, the physics student waited four hours before alerting emergency services to the shocking blood bath at his family's luxury home near Cape Town, a week ago. Seeking legal help: Henri van Breda was treated for minor injuries following the brutal triple murder of his parents and brother. His family have appointed top defence lawyer Pieter Botha to represent the 20-year-old who, officers say, surfed the internet twice before phoning for help . Hired: Shrien Dewani (right) used defence lawyer Pieter Botha (left) and had his murder charge thrown out. The lawyer is now representing Henri van Breda after being appointed by the 20-year-old's family . Barrister Pieter Botha – whose savage cross-examination style helped dismantle the state's case against bisexual Mr Dewani who was on trial for the contract killing of his Swedish wife, Anni – has consulted with Henri, who is being looked after by relatives who have vowed to 'stand by him no matter what'. 'The family think that it is prudent at this time to appoint an expert legal team and there has been a consultation,' family spokesman Ben Rootman told Mailonline. Mr Dewani, 34, was freed in December on all charges relating to the fatal shooting of his bride of two weeks during their honeymoon to Cape Town in 2010, after Mr Botha, and a colleague, successfully argued that the case against him should be thrown out. Tragic: Rudi, pictured right with a university friend, died in the attack. Surviving brother Henri has appointed well-known lawyer Pieter Botha . A close family friend described the van Bredas as 'like a perfect family' Mr Botha, who has spent more than two decades at the South African bar, has defended some of the country's most high profile cases. He is feared by expert witnesses for his confrontational, flamboyant questioning of witnesses. During Mr Dewani's trial, which followed the businessman's three year battle against extradition to South Africa, Mr Botha forced the state's ballistics expert to concede almost every point of his report to the court. Police are waiting to question schoolgirl Marli, who is the only other surviving witness to the appalling attack, a week ago, but it will be sometime until she is in a fit state to provide any information. She is being treated for severe head injuries, including a severed jugular vein after undergoing emergency brain surgery. She is now in a 'stable' condition, but can only communicate by blinking. According to one report in a South African newspaper, a police doctor had found Henri's own minor injuries to have been 'self-inflicted' despite telling police how his family were attacked by 'two or three men' wielding an axe. Post mortems on the three dead family members – Martin, 54, his wife Teresa, 55 and their son Rudi, 22 – found they had been killed at around 3am, four hours before Henri made a phone call for help. Chilling: An audio recording between Henri (right, pictured with brother Rudi) and emergency services after his family were hacked to death with an axe, revealed the 20-year-old appeared to giggle during the call . In the five-minute phone call from his mobile, Henri appears remarkably calm, but at one point appears to stifle a giggle during the call from the exclusive high-security golf-estate where the family lived in the winelands outside Cape Town. According to police sources, Henri told investigators that he was in an upstairs bathroom at the wealthy family's home at De Zalze estate, in Stellenbosch in the early hours of last Tuesday morning when intruders attacked his family. He described how an unknown killer first hacked to death his brother, Rudi, 'with tremendous strength with an axe'. Survivor: The attackers left Marli (pictured) with a cut throat and 'severe' head injuries on the balcony of her home in Stellenbosch - 50 kilometres east of Cape Town. She has started blinking in reacting to questions from investigators officers . According to his account to police, father Martin rushed to defend his older son, but was cut down as by the killer. Mother, Teresa, was the next to be murdered, while Marli somehow survived appalling injuries. Henri said in his interview with investigators that he was 'knocked out cold' and the attacker 'threw the axe at him'. When he regained consciousness, he phoned police on his mobile, just after 7.30am last Tuesday. According to his phone records, Henri surfed the internet twice before phoning for help. Reports claim he appeared confused about times and dates, but was calm and composed when recounting events to police, apart from he was asked about his sister when he became distressed. Tributes: Relatives say Henri was at a memorial service held in Pretoria for his family including brother Rudi (right) last week but was kept away from reporters . Henri was not seen at the memorial service held in Pretoria for his family last week, but relatives insist he had been present, but was kept hidden from reporters. The van Breda family had only moved back to South Africa from Australia last year. It was while in the South African capital, that Henri had met his solicitor Lorida van Niekerk, who will be working alongside Mr Botha.

"From smartbands to high-end pedometers, never before have there been so many gadgets that claim to monitor health and boost fitness. But as technology gallops ahead, most come at a considerable financial cost. Now researchers have found that smartphone apps that track an physical activity are in fact just as accurate as many fitness gadgets. Scroll down for video . Researchers have found that smartphone apps that track an individual’s physical activity, are just as accurate as software in fitness gadgets. A stock image of the Flex is pictured . The study compared the performance of a five devices  - including Nike’s Fuelband, the Jawbone UP24 and Fitbit Flex - against five apps. They analysed their ability to count steps as these are often used to calculate other measures of physical activity, such as distance covered or calories. A total of 14 participants walked on a treadmill for 500 and 1,500 steps, multiple times, while different technologies counted their footsteps, according to a new research letter in the Journal of the American Medical Association (Jama). ‘In this study, we wanted to address one of the challenges with using wearable devices: they must be accurate, said University of Pennsylvania medical student and lead study author, Meredith Case. ‘After all, if a device is going to be effective at monitoring - and potentially changing - behaviour, individuals have to be able to trust the data.’ The study was based 10 devices and apps’ ability to count steps and popular wearables. Screenshots from the iPhone Moves app - one of those surveyed - are shown left and right. Step counts are often used to derive other measures of physical activity, such as distance or calories . In the study, a total of 14 participants walked on a treadmill for 500 and 1,500 steps, multiple times, while technology counted their footsteps to determine the accuracy of the apps and gadgets.

Fitbit Flex . Fitbit One . Fitbit Zip . Digi-Walker SW-200 . ‘We found that smartphone apps are just as accurate as wearable devices for tracking physical activity.’ The study is a follow-up to a recent Jama viewpoint suggesting that there's little evidence that wearable devices alone can change behaviour and improve health for those that need it most. In the experiment, each of the healthy adults wore a waistband with one pedometer and two accelerometers attached, as well as three wearables on their wrist and two smartphones in their pockets. The iPhone ran three apps - Moves,Health Mate and Fitbit - while the Android ran one Moves app. At the end of each trial, step counts from each device were recorded. The 10 top-selling devices and fitness apps in the US that were tested, were: Galaxy S4 Moves app, iPhone 5s Moves app, iPhone 5S Health Mate app, iPhone 5s Fitbit app, as well as Nike’s Fuelband, the Jawbone UP24, Fitbit Flex, Fitbit One Fitbit Zip and the Digi-Walker SW-200. The data from the smartphones were only slightly different than the observed step counts, with a range of minus 6.7 to 6.2 percent relative difference in mean step count. The results suggest that the Fitbit One and Zip devices are the most accurate surveyed, while Nike's Fuelband (pictured), appears to have the largest margin for error in the 500 and 1,500 step trials. However, over all, smartphone apps performed as accurately as wearables . But the data from the wearable devices differed more, with a range of between minus 22.7 to minus 1.5 percent. The results suggest that the Fitbit One and Zip devices are the most accurate surveyed, while Nike's Fuelband, appears to have the largest margin for error in the 500 and 1,500 step trials. Apps such as Moves for iPhone proved fairly accurate. The free app automatically tracks walking, running and cycling and shows a user's day as a simple storyline. It counts steps and shows calories burned for each activity. Professor Mitesh Patel, an attending physician at the Philadelphia VA Medical Centre, who also teaches at the university, said: ‘Since step counts are such an important part of how these devices and apps measure physical activity, including calculating distance or calories burned, their accuracy is key. ‘Compared to the one to two percent of adults in the U.S. that own a wearable device, more than 65 percent of adults carry a smartphone. Our findings suggest that smartphone apps could prove to be a more widely accessible and affordable way of tracking health behaviours.’","Researchers at the University of Pennsylvania tested 10 best-selling apps and fitness gadgets by using them to count steps taken by volunteers .

"A New York City rookie officer has been charged with manslaughter, official misconduct and other charges in the accidental shooting death of a man in a darkened stairwell of a Brooklyn public housing complex. Officer Peter Liang pleaded not guilty Wednesday in the November death of 28-year-old Akai Gurley. He was released without bail. The Brooklyn courtroom was packed with officers. Liang and his partner were patrolling the Louis Pink Houses, a public housing complex where reports of violent crime had spiked. The hallways were pitch black, and Liang had his gun drawn. Police said it appeared he accidentally fired a shot. Gurley had been waiting for an elevator. When it didn't come, he stepped into the hallway to take the stairs and was one floor above when he was struck. Scroll down for video . NYPD rookie cop Peter Liang is pictured arriving in Brooklyn criminal court on Wednesday. He was charged today with manslaughter, criminal misconduct, and other counts for the shooting death of Akai Gurley . Liang looked somber as he entered court on Wednesday, one day after a grand jury indicted him for the November incident . Earlier Wednesday, NYPD officer Peter Liang arrived at the 84th  Precinct for booking  in a black van, which was parked outside the building in an attempt to shield the cop from reporters and photographers. Dressed in a black suit, he was silent as he entered the station where he will be booked before appearing later today in court for his arraignment. A Brooklyn grand jury heard the case against Liang for just a few days before they decided to issue an indictment on Tuesday. Justice: Unarmed father-of-one, Akai Gurley (pictured) was shot dead by Liang in November. His death was one of a series of deaths involving black men at the hands of police which sparked angry protests across the United States last year . Gurley's girlfriend, who was with him at the time of the shooting, is seen leaving Brooklyn court today . The indictment comes after mass protests and calls for reform of the grand jury system nationwide following a Staten Island grand jury's refusal to indict a police officer in the chokehold death of Eric Garner and a Missouri grand jury's decision not to indict an officer in the death of Michael Brown. The November death of Gurley, 28, was ruled a 'homicide' by the Medical Examiner's office - just as Eric Garner's was. Rynecki said the shooting was unjustified, regardless of whether it was intentional. 'This is the first step for justice,' he said. Asian-American Liang and his partner were patrolling the Louis Pink Houses, a public housing development in Brooklyn's gritty East New York neighborhood, on November 20. Protestors hold up signs outside the courthouse before the arraignment of New York City rookie police officer Peter Liang on Wednesday . The indictment comes after mass protests and calls for reform of the grand jury system nationwide following a Staten Island grand jury's refusal to indict a police officer in the chokehold death of Eric Garner and a Missouri grand jury's decision not to indict an officer in the death of Michael Brown. Above, more protesters outside Liang's hearing this morning . The New York Police Department assigns rookie officers as reinforcements in parts of the city that have seen increases in crime. The housing project, where Gurley's friend lives, had been the scene of a recent shooting, robberies and assaults. The officers had descended onto an eighth-floor landing when, 14 steps away, Gurley and the woman who had been braiding his hair opened a door into the seventh-floor landing after giving up their wait for the elevator so he could head to the lobby. The lights were burned out in the stairwell, leaving it 'pitch black' and prompting both officers to use flashlights, police said after the shooting. Liang, for reasons unclear, also had his gun drawn, police said. He was about 10 feet from Gurley when, without a word and apparently by accident, he fired a shot, police said. Gurley was struck in the chest. The two made it down two flights of stairs after he was shot, but he collapsed on the fifth-floor landing and lost consciousness, according to the woman, Melissa Butler. Scene: A stairwell is seen at a building in a public housing project in Brooklyn known as the 'Pink Houses', where Gurley was killed by Liang . Gurley was taken to a nearby hospital, where he died, police said. After Liang discharged the bullet, he and partner Shaun Landau did not respond to radio contact for more than 6.5 minutes, the New York Daily News reported in December. New York police almost immediately declared that his death was a 'very unfortunate tragedy' and commissioner Bill Bratton described Gurley as a 'total innocent.' Police officials pieced together the details of the shooting from radio reports and interviews with the girlfriend and the second officer, but they have not spoken to Liang and won't until after the criminal proceedings are completed. Liang was placed on desk duty after the shooting. The shooting came at a time when the NYPD, the nation's biggest police department, is changing how rookie officers are used fresh out of the academy to give them more training and time with more senior officers. The shooting recalled a 2004 incident in which 19-year-old Timothy Stansbury was shot dead by a startled officer on a Brooklyn rooftop of a housing complex. His family got a $2 million settlement with the city. Patrick J. Lynch, head of Liang's union, said he deserves due process. 'The fact that he was assigned to patrol one of the most dangerous housing projects in New York City must be considered among the circumstances of this tragic accident,' Lynch said.

"It’s a struggle to feed a family on a tight budget. Soaring food prices have put added pressure on cash-strapped families with some resorting to cheap processed food and failing to eat enough fruit and vegetables. But it is possible to tasty, nutritious meals without breaking the bank. On a tight budget? It's not that difficult to feed your family well if you plan all your meals and take advantage of special deals and offers . Tecso's spring chicken casserole has courgettes, tomatoes and butter beans and costs just £3.85 to make . All you need to to do is budget judiciously and shop wisely. And while it will take time and some organisational skills, it can be very rewarding. Do your grocery shop towards the end of the day when supermarkets start to fill up their discount shelves with food that will be going off in a days' time. It's also always worth planning exactly what you are going to cook and buying the right amount of ingredients for that meal. Also remember to do a little research before shopping; some own-store brands are just as good as big names and can cost considerably less than what you would normally pay. At £5, Sainsbury's crispy mash hash is the costliest recipe featured . In December 2014, mother of three Deanne Wilson, from Headlingley, Leeds, who relied on benefits after being forced to give up her job due to cancer, said that she could feed her entire family for £30 a week, . She said she uses the bulk of her budget to buy quality meat, before padding out meals with lots of fresh fruit and vegetables. 'The food is marked down because it's going out of date in a day or so, but because I cook everything fresh every day it makes no difference,' she said.

"She's regarded as one of soap's most stylish stars so it's no surprise that Lipsy snapped Michelle Keegan up to design a fashion range. The former Coronation Street star, whose collections have been a stellar success for the brand, is preparing to launch her debut summer range - and she's been hard at work in the design studio to bring fans exactly what they want. Launching in March, the 27-year-old's new range will be full of crochet, lace, slinky satins and lightweight knits, as well some 'fresh and exciting never-been-seen-before designs'. Scroll down for video . Michelle Keegan has shared her fashion mantra as she promotes her upcoming Lipsy range, citing Audrey Hepburn has a classy dresser she loves to emulate . Actress Michelle, who is currently planning her wedding to Mark Wright, said of her upcoming range: 'One of my favourite parts of summer is being able to experiment with brand new styles and colours. 'It’s the easiest season to wear fresh statement brights and hot new prints. I also love soft earthy shades such as nude and taupe complemented by sun kissed skin.' Michelle has taken inspiration from the catwalk, and included lots of the monochrome pieces she loves to wear herself to create a range of swimwear, beach cover-ups and nighttime apparel. Michelle advises fashion fans to keep it 'classic and simple' because she's all for 'timeless classic style a la Audrey Hepburn', right . Launching in March, the 27-year-old's new range will be full of crochet, lace, slinky satins and lightweight knits, as well some 'fresh and exciting never-been-seen-before designs', including this black dress . The actress has given fans a sneak peek of what's to come. Last night, she attended Lipsy's SS15 press event dressed head-to-toe in her upcoming designs. Speaking as she arrived at the event in a casual yet chic ensemble, she said: 'My top tip for day wear glamour is: keep it simple, keep it comfortable and wear key pieces. Whether it’s a statement jacket or a bag. My Lipsy Duster coat was my arrival staple for today’s launch.' The pint-sized star also emphasised the importance of exuding confidence. She said: 'If you’re feeling unsure about anything you’re wearing, ditch it. You’ll feel out of sorts all day if you don’t give your entire outfit a thumbs up.' Michelle road-tested some of her soon-to-launch designs on a night out in Essex on Wednesday night . As for her beauty look, the radiant star takes a less is more approach to make-up. 'Keep a fresh-faced feel. With day wear make-up, you can always add to it later in the evening.' Michelle did exactly that. After leaving the event at London's Ham Yard Hotel, she was whisked across town to the British Heart Foundation Roll Out the Red Ball, and slipped into a little black dress. Her top three tips for evening glam? 'Choose what you reveal. Show cleavage or leg, never both of them together. I’m big up top so definitely more in favour of showing off my legs. 'Secondly, keep it classic and simple. I love a little black dress and I’m all for timeless classic style a la Audrey Hepburn. Dress for your shape, too. If you’ve got curves, accentuate them. If you’re tall, embrace it. 'Finally, invest in a really good body moisturiser. It really finishes off the look.' Michelle has recently finished filming on her new TV show, Ordinary Lies, her first major role since quitting ITV soap Coronation Street. The actress used to play Tina McIntyre on Corrie's cobbles but has switched allegiances to the BBC where she'll portray car showroom receptionist Tracy in the new six-part series.

"On the rack: Former HMRC tax chief Dave Hartnett was accused of being 'cavalier' with public money . The former head of HMRC faced growing criticism yesterday over claims he failed to pursue prosecutions against HSBC’s Swiss customers before taking a job with the bank. Critics accused the agency of adopting a ‘selective prosecution policy’ towards tax evasion cases linked to Britain’s biggest bank and questioned whether it had taken a deliberate strategy to minimise legal action. Dave Hartnett was permanent secretary for tax at HMRC when French authorities handed over account data in 2010. Yet just three cases were passed to the Crown Prosecution Service and there has been only one conviction. He retired as Britain’s top tax official in 2012 and took up a job as an adviser with HSBC in 2013 – a move which was signed off by the Prime Minister. Labour MP John Mann, a member of the Treasury select committee, told the Mail it was ‘totally unacceptable’ for Mr Hartnett to move to HSBC after his job at HMRC. ‘It’s all too cosy,’ he said. ‘It demonstrates that the HMRC has not been fit for purpose for some time.’ Mr Hartnett, 63, retired from HMRC after facing criticism that he signed off ‘sweetheart’ deals which saved Starbucks and Vodafone to avoid billions in tax payments. His tenure at the Revenue was dogged by claims that he helped multinational companies shave millions of pounds off their tax bills. Described as Britain’s most ‘wined and dined’ civil servant, he sparked controversy when it emerged he enjoyed 107 meals with corporate giants over a three-year period. He was severely criticised for brokering a deal that saved Goldman Sachs £20million in interest payments and stepped down after he was accused of lying to MPs over the deal and being ‘cavalier’ with taxpayers’ money. A 2013 court case heard Mr Hartnett personally overruled legal advice and HMRC’s own guidelines to order officials to stop chasing the bank over the tax bill. High Court judge Mr Justice Nicol ruled the deal was lawful but ‘not a glorious episode in the history of the revenue’. When it later emerged he had taken advisory roles with HSBC and City giant Deloitte, the chairman of the public accounts committee Margaret Hodge accused him of ‘greed’ and ‘losing all sense of what is right’. Accused: A 2013 court case heard Mr Hartnett personally overruled legal advice and HMRC’s own guidelines to order officials to stop chasing Goldman Sachs over a tax bill for £20million in interest payments . MPs on the committee are due to question HMRC chief executive Lin Homer about the leaked Swiss account details and Lord Green of Hurstpierpoint is also expected to be called to face questions later this year. Mrs Hodge has said she would ‘order’ executives at the beleaguered bank to give evidence if necessary. Mr Hartnett was last night unavailable for comment, but has previously denied that HSBC’s private banking customers were offered an amnesty. In a 2011 statement, he warned HMRC was closing in on offshore tax evaders and said bank customers whose details were among the stolen data should come forward. He said: ‘This is not an amnesty. There are no special rates of penalty or interest for those who come forward voluntarily.’ ‘This is an opportunity for those who have made errors in past returns to correct them. The net is closing on offshore evaders.’","Dave Hartnett was agency's tax chief when it was handed details in 2010 .

"Cindy Crawford has launched a meal delivery service that enables customers to follow a clean and healthy eating plan – without the restrictions of a traditional cleanse. The 48-year-old supermodel has teamed up with Neka Pasquale, the founder of organic food company Urban Remedy, to create Cindy's Essentials - a line of shakes, cold-pressed juices, snacks, meals and even caffeinated beverages that can be consumed in three days or spread out over the course of a week. 'It's not a cleanse,' she told Elle. 'That's such a thing, like: ""Oh, I'm on a cleanse."" But this is just having something as convenient as vending machine food that's good for you.' Scroll down for video . Living simple: Cindy Crawford, 48, has teamed up with organic food company Urban Remedy to create Cindy's Essentials, a pre-planned meal service that includes shakes, snacks, lunches and dinners . Clean eating: One Cindy's Essentials plan costs $224.99 for three days and comes with juices, smoothies and meals, including a Mediterranean quinoa bowl and zucchini pasta . The kits, which cost $224.99 each, come complete with mint cacao chip smoothies, a variety of green juices, a series of snacks and three lunches and dinners, which include a variety of tasty dishes such as a shredded kale salad and vegetarian pad Thai. Clean eating expert Neka reiterated that the eating plan is not a cleanse, although she added that following the plan will have a similar effect on anyone who is used to consuming a lot of processed foods. Surprisingly, users can choose a kit that includes caffeinated beverages - which are typically banned in most clean eating plans. But according to Cindy and Neka, not all caffeine is made equal. Neka explained to the outlet that their plan's beverage options have 'special caffeine' which makes the drinks far healthier than your average cup of coffee or tea. 'It's cold-brewed coffee so it has less acid in it,' she said. 'And it has almond milk in it. And then the other option is a matcha tea with almond milk. They're healthy caffeine choices.' Cindy stressed the importance of starting the day with a solid breakfast and noted that she has a protein shake every morning. The mother-of-one said she likes to have salads with lean protein for lunch and always allows herself to have healthy snacks like the sweet potato hummus and almonds available in her plan. Perfect pair: The supermodel created the eating plan with Urban Remedy founder Neka Pasquale (right) Healthy snack: Cindy was captured drinking the company's cacao almond milk during a photo shoot . The model explained that she grew up eating junk food, but when she moved to New York she realized she was not one of those models who could eat whatever they wanted without suffering the consequences. However, when she started paying attention to food trends, she found that there were often contradictory messages. 'It is confusing to decipher between diet fads, ingredient trends and true expertise, and – like everyone – I was overwhelmed until I met Neka,' she said in a recent statement about her new food-focused venture. She added: 'Together, we want to make it easier for people to access credible information and healthy well-balanced food that tastes great.' Cindy is joining slew of celebrities who have debuted their own eating plans and meal delivery services. Gwyneth Paltrow touts her detox plans, which eliminate coffee, alcohol, sugar, eggs, wheat, meat and processed foods, on her website Goop. She also published a detox friendly cookbook titled It's All Good in 2013. Earlier this month, Beyonce and her trainer Marco Borges launched 22 Days Nutrition, a vegan meal plan. The singer was inspired to create the on-demand meal service after consuming only plant-based foods for 22 days.","The 48-year-old has teamed up with organic food company Urban Remedy to create Cindy's Essentials .

French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius said this morning that 'quite a number of problems remain' in negotiations aimed at ending the fighting, adding that it was 'very probable' but not certain that French President Francois Hollande would attend the talks. Fabius said difficulties remain on the future of  eastern Ukraine, guarantees about the Ukraine-Russia border near the area, and the prospects of a possible cease-fire, weapons pullback and prisoner exchange.

"Thousands of bibles could be removed from university accommodation after they were branded 'inappropriate' in a multicultural environment. More than half of students surveyed at Aberystwyth University said they felt the compulsory inclusion of the book from Gideon International was 'uncomfortable' or 'unacceptable'. A proposal to have all bibles withdrawn from university-owned bedrooms will be put forward by the university's Students' Union council  at a meeting later this month. Bibles could be removed from rooms at Aberystwyth University after more than half of students surveyed said the compulsory inclusion of the book from Gideon International was 'uncomfortable' or 'unacceptable' The US-based Christian organisation has been providing free bibles to universities for several years and has distributed 1.8billion globally to hotels, hospitals and care homes since 1908. A survey of students at Pentre Jane Morgan halls of residence was conducted by Aberystwyth Students' Union. It found that around 50 per cent of respondents found the compulsory inclusion of Bibles 'uncomfortable' or 'unacceptable' and only four per cent stated that it was a 'good idea'. The matter was raised at a student council meeting by student John David Morgan on January 22, where 50 people showed up. The motion, put forward at a student union council meeting, will be discussed later this month following results from the survey at Aberystwyth University (pictured) He said the 'inclusion of Bibles in university bedrooms is inappropriate in a multicultural university such as Aberystwyth.' 'It could be offensive for some, and the university should provide a safe space for students to explore and develop their beliefs in a neutral environment. 'Bibles should, however, still be available for those who wish to have them,' he added. The motion calls for all bibles to be removed from university bedrooms at the end of the current academic year. Mr Morgan proposed replacing it with an option in the accommodation application process to allow students to have a bible in their bedroom should they so wish. University bosses said it will review the policy if Aberystwyth Students' Union back their removal. An Aberystwyth University spokesman said that the books are 'replenished annually' and that there is no fine if they are taken from the rooms. The new rooms at the recently-opened Penglais Farm have yet to receive bibles, the spokesman added. Gideon International did not wish to comment on the recent proposal. James Catford, a former student of Aberystwyth University, and now the Group Chief Executive of Bible Society said: . 'The answer to a diverse and multicultural society is not to remove all traces of diversity. That seems illiberal and intolerant. 'As a graduate of the university, I would challenge those who are voting to spend some time with Luke's Gospel, for example, so they can make an informed decision. 'No student would vote in the General Election without knowing what each party and candidate stood for, and the same should be true of this vote. University bosses said it will review the policy if Aberystwyth Students' Union back the proposal to have the bibles removed by the end of the current academic year . 'Many people think they know what the Bible stands for but our research shows that nine out of ten don't engage with it – so the students might be surprised if they do.' Reverend Ian Girling, Vicar of Holy Trinity Church, Aberystwyth, added: 'These bibles are a free gift to the students and have helped many over the years through difficult times so it would be a great shame to lose them. 'However, we, as local churches and chaplains, will continue to welcome all students to come and see us, whatever their circumstances and needs.' Other universities have banned Gideon Bibles removed in the past including Huddersfield University in 2013, which said it wanted its properties to be 'ethically neutral'. It also claimed to removed them because many of the students are from overseas, however, the move was branded 'anti-Christian' by Rev Mike Smith, a former minister at Huddersfield's Golcar Baptist Church. Stirling University Students' Association (SUSA) also called to have them removed from halls of residence, claiming it was 'presumptuous' and offensive to different religions on the campus. Last year, one of Britain's largest hotel chains - Travelodge - removed bibles from all its bedrooms for 'diversity reasons'. It said the policy was implemented 'in order not to discriminate against any religion' – despite having had no complaints from guests at any of its 500 hotels. Bibles were taken away at the same time as a refurbishment of its rooms, removing drawers where they were kept. The Gideon Society was founded in 1898 and has distributed 1.8billion free bibles in hotels, hospitals, prisons, care homes, medical centres as well as student accommodation . The practice of placing Bibles in British hotel rooms originated with the Commercial Travellers' Christian Association late in the Victorian era. The organisation was founded in 1888, with backing from the owners of biscuit manufacturer McVitie's, and donated bibles to hotels around the country. In more recent years, the work was taken over by the Gideon Society, which distributes free Bibles in almost 194 countries worldwide. Members of the Gideon Society, an evangelical Christian organisation founded in the US in 1898, were inspired to give out free Bibles in hotel rooms after visiting Britain and seeing the Commercial Travellers' Christian Association's work. In the UK, the Gideon Society, whose income comes from donations and bequests from wills, still continues this mission – giving out free bibles to large institutions, including hospitals and prisons. Copies of the New Testament are also presented to school pupils, members of the armed forces, police, ambulance and fire services.","More than half of students at Aberystwyth University want bibles removed .

"One Direction fans looking to take the perfect snap with their favourite boy band with the help of their selfie stick will sadly be disappointed. The venue hosting the Brisbane leg of the teenage heartthrobs on their On the Road Again Tour has banned Directioners - the name given to the group's keen followers. The restriction is listed under Suncorp Stadium's One Direction Frequently Asked Questions section. Scroll down for video . Niall Horan, Harry Styles and Louis Tomlinson (left to right) jet out of Sydney ahead of their Brisbane shows . Selfie sticks are incredibly popular, particularly amongst tweens, and have become a commonplace item at concerts. They can be used to take the perfect high-angle selfie or capture a quality image of the performers . A girl takes a picture with a selfie stick at Beat The Drum music festival in Sydney in January. Selfie sticks are now banned from many venues, including Suncorp Stadium in Brisbane for the upcoming One Direction gig . 'For the safety and comfort of other patrons, selfie sticks are not permitted into the stadium for this event,' the stadium's website said. Other restricted items include alcohol, pepper spray or mace, fireworks, studded jewellery, spurs and unusually long wallet chains. If anyone is found with any of these items during the performance, they 'may be subject to detention or possible eviction from the stadium without refund'. But it seems that will not ruin any of the fun planned by the super group, with the band being well-received by Sydneysiders on Saturday night when they kicked off their tour in Australia. Going off with a bang! One Direction kicked off their Sydney show with a vibrant display at Allianz Stadium on Saturday night . They put on a colourful display of fireworks for fans at their first concert Down Under. Allianz Stadium glowed in deep reds and sunset oranges as the beloved boy band took their bows. Despite the long-haul flight to Australia, the fab five looked fresh and delivered an impressive high-energy, two-hour set. Kicking off their monster show with Clouds, every punter in the crowd appeared to know the words and sung along enthusiastically. Heartthrob Harry Styles looked every inch a rockstar in a crisp black shirt, super tight jeans and shiny gold boots. The former baker initially wore his curly locks out but after much writhing about on stage, he swept his cumbersome mane up and styled it into his world famous man bun. Bright lights: Harry Styles rocked an all-black outfit and showed off his mermaid tattoo . The only way is up: Liam Payne gestured towards the sky as he readjusted his ear piece . Total entertainment: 1D will be supported by McBusted and local act Samantha Jade . Dreamy: Louis Tomlinson cut a striking figure against the incredible backdrop of the stadium . Screams of joy reverberated through the crowd when 1D gave their very own rendition of Bruno Mars and Mark Ronson's current hit Uptown Funk. Meanwhile delighted fans quickly jumped on Twitter to praise the lads' show: 'The fireworks at one direction concerts are bigger than my grades and brighter than my future,' one user joked. 'Wow. just wow! A night I'll never forget. Those boys sure know how to put on a good show,' another added. Finishing off the evening with their smash hit Best Song Ever ensured punters worked up a sweat on the dance floor. The bigger the better! The boys were dwarfed by the enormous fireworks going off in the background . Ahead of the show, Harry took to Twitter to express his excitement: 'On The Road Again is about to start, very excited to be back in Australia. Can't wait to see everyone out there. All the love,' he wrote. 'Today was like 1st day at school and u sit at your test paper and everything goes except there's lots of people and I had no pen,' Liam added. 'Amazing first show! Love you Sydney!!!' Louis agreed. This marks One Direction's fourth headlining concert and will promote the band's fourth studio album, appropriately named Four. British band McBusted and local songstress Samantha Jade are supporting the group during the Australian leg of their tour. On The Road Again will cover some serious ground jetting around Asia, Europe and North America before wrapping up at the Motorpoint Arena in Sheffield, England, at the end of October.","Suncorp Stadium has banned selfie sticks from the upcoming 1D concert .

"No sooner had Jon Stewart left Daily Show fans gobsmacked with his decision to bow out after 16 years at Comedy Central than the race has begun to find someone with the right credentials to adequately replace him. 'This show doesn't deserve an even slightly restless host and neither do you,' he told his audience on Tuesday night. He said he might depart in July, September or maybe December. Stewart's passion, wit and boldness make for a magical combination that will be difficult to re-create when he steps away later this year. Scroll down for video . No sooner had Jon Stewart left Daily Show fans gobsmacked with his decision to bow out after 16 years than the race has begun to find someone with the right credentials to adequately replace him . Big shoes to fill: Late-night television is long overdue a female host and Amy Schumer could be the ideal candidate, while hosting The Daily Show could be just the reinvention Brian Williams needs . An early favorite to replace Stewart is British comedian John Oliver who stood in for him in 2013, but left soon after to host a similar show at HBO . 'The X-factor here is Stewart's charisma. It's significant,' said Sophia McClennen, a Penn State professor and author of Is Satire Saving Our Nation?: Mockery And American Politics. The Daily Show averages just slightly more than 1 million viewers a night - a far smaller audience than his late-night competition on the big networks - but during his time as host Stewart has became disproportionately influential in U.S. politics and culture. Under Stewart, the show has won 18 Emmys, taking home the award for Best Variety Series every year from 2003 to 2012. It also won two Peabody Awards, for its election coverage in 2000 and 2004. In a 2004 poll by the Pew Research Center for the People and the Press, 21 percent of respondents aged 18 to 29 cited The Daily Show as a regular source of political news. The Daily Show boot camp has graduated a number of impressive talents who might prove to be worthy of the host chair, McClennen said, counting John Oliver first among a group including Aasif Mandvi, Samantha Bee and Jason Jones. There are outsiders who certainly have the comedic chops. But do they have the star power and the backbone to speak punchlines to power, and on a nightly basis? Possible successors: Jessica Williams is already The Daily Show's 'senior youth' correspondent, while Chris Rock is an established comedian known for his outspoken views on modern America . Daily Show regulars Samantha Bee and Jason Jones are other names that have been thrown in the hat as the search begins to replace Jon Stewart . Looking over the possibilities, here are some candidates to consider: . Ex-SNL alumnae Tina Fey and Amy Poehler have been mentioned as possible replacements for Jon Stewart . Other names in the frame for The Daily Show include Aisha Tyler and Joel McHale .","Stewart announced on Tuesday that after 16 years he will step down from Comedy Central's The Daily Show later in the year .
Hunt is now on to find someone worthy of filling the enormous hole he is leaving behind .
Early favorite is British comedian John Oliver who stood in for Stewart in 2013, but left soon after to host a similar show at HBO .
List of potential replacements also includes Tina Fey, Chris Rock, Amy Schumer and even disgraced NBC anchor Brian Williams .
John Oliver: He's top of the list for a reason: He proved he could emerge from the Daily Show ranks and succeed as host when Stewart took a movie-making break. Oliver and his dimples defected to HBO, but his return home would be triumphant.
Tina Fey or Amy Poehler: Paired for efficiency's sake given their frequent collaborations. Like Stewart and Oliver, they've got the likability that helps make hard-hitting satire palatable — and how about at least one woman in late-night TV?
Amy Schumer: There is a growing argument that late-night television is long overdue a female host. The vacancy at The Daily Show could be an ideal opportunity for Schumer, whose Comedy Central series premiere in 2013 was the network’s most-watched premiere that year.
Chris Hardwick: A growing star at Comedy Central where he already hosts the social media-oriented show @midnight. The comedian also has a regular gig fronting Walking Dead spin-off The Talking Dead. Could be a strong contender because of his youthful fan base.
Chris Rock: Brilliantly funny, certainly fearless. He wrote an essay about being black in an entertainment industry that is 'kind of racist' in its hiring practices — although he said he wasn't being political at all, adding, 'that's Stewart, that's (Bill) Maher.'
Seth MacFarlane: He's a writer, performer and singer who can summon the juvenile glee, if not the artfulness, that Stewart employs to leaven the angst. And he could bring a sidekick, his devilish movie creation Ted the teddy bear.
Aisha Tyler: An experienced all-rounder with talent to spare. She co-hosts The Talk, has acted in series including Ghost Whisperer, CSI, Talk Soup and Friends and also hosts Whose Line is it Anyway?
Jessica Williams: A Daily Show player whose titles include 'senior youth' and 'senior Beyonce' correspondent, she's brimming with energy and edgy charm. Whether she has the experience and heft to step into the center ring is an open question.
Aasif Mandvi, Samantha Bee and Jason Jones: Experienced Daily Show regulars but when Stewart took a break during the Summer of 2013 to direct his movie Rosewater, it was their colleague Oliver who was trusted in the big chair.
Joel McHale: The Soup host already balances his Community sitcom role with a host gig, so why not step it up? He's quick witted, lovable and has a following that encompasses the frat-boy demo that is undeniably part of the Daily Show fan base.
Brian Williams: The disgraced NBC Nightly News host has technically been sacked but is starting a six month suspension. Williams may use his extended break to reconsider where his career is going and isn't it his desire to be considered more than just a news anchor that got him into trouble in the first place? Could be just the reinvention he needs."
"From Facebook to Instagram, we spend an increasing amount of time documenting our lives on the internet. Now there’s a service that claims to allow people to set up an ‘online tomb’ so they can create their own web-based memorial to show themselves in the best light after death too. The satirical service, called EverTomb costs from $1 a month and lets users add new features so the digital tombs will ‘evolve to a great and probably creepy memorial of your online existence.’ EverTomb allows people to set up an ‘online tomb’ so they can create their own web-based memorial to show themselves in the best light, for when they have passed on. The advert from the firm's website is shown . The Amsterdam-based start-up’s website says that tombs can also be used during their owner's lifetime. It reads: ‘Your tomb lets followers connect with you in the social afterlife and make some beautiful offerings.’ Essentially, it offers users the chance to make a memorial for themselves, despite being alive. Currently there are no examples of what these tombs may look like, but 202 people have signed up so far. The satirical site includes instructions, such as: ‘Let people know that you died online or just prepare for the afterlife like a great digital Pharaoh.’ There are no examples of what these tombs may look like, but 202 people have signed up so far. The jokey site includes instructions, such as: ‘Let people know that you died online or just prepare for the afterlife like a great digital Pharaoh . It adds: ‘You don’t want to be remembered with a boring memorial page. Act first and build the greatest and most creepy tomb out there.’ Wiel Menger, from the firm, told MailOnline: 'We are working on different digital tomb designs to choose from and this could later be open for other designers to create awesome tomb templates for others to use. ‘Other features we are working on are the use of music and video, tomb followers, tomb location and possibly a service to plan the disclosure of messages and video messages to your tomb followers or a certain group.’ There is even a possibility that tomb owners could monetise their final digital resting place by asking for offerings. The company says that the service could be used in many ways, including as a joke to creep people out or to ‘show greatness like a god of the internet and even use it as a resume to really get that new job.’ It may be possible to live forever by uploading your memories, thoughts and personality onto a computer within the next ten or twenty years, according to a leading pioneer of the technology. The technology, which is similar to that seen in the film Transcendence starring Johnny Depp, is being developed by entrepreneur Martine Rothblatt. She has already created a disturbingly realistic robotic 'clone' of her wife Bina that she hopes will be a prototype for the technology. An entrepreneur who has already created a robotic 'clone' of her wife (shown in the video) is developing technology that could upload an individual's memories, thoughts and personality onto a computer in the next 10 to 20 years . The robot apparently shares the ideas and personality of Bina by creating a database of her memories, beliefs and thoughts, along with information taken from social media interactions and blogs she shares. This allows the robot, called Bina48, to express opinions and interact in conversations like a real, living person. Mrs Rothblatt, 60, an internet radio entrepreneur who lives as a transgender woman, believes the these 'Mind Clones' could eventually be used to help provide social interactions for people living alone and even help recreate the personalities of people after they have died. Mrs Rothblatt, who lives in Florida and is one of the highest paid female chief executive officers in the US, said that eventually people may be able to carry around clones of their own minds on their smartphones. Speaking to Bloomberg, she said: 'Mind clone is a digital copy of your mind outside of your body. 'Mind clones are ten to twenty years away. The mind clone will look like an avatar on the screen instead of a robot version.' Mrs Rothblatt first began developing Bina48 five years ago to replicate her wife, who she married 30 years ago. Mr Weil said that the idea for EverTomb was born in the middle of the night. ‘One of us jolted awake and wrote down the idea...next morning he told me and we found out this could be really something with endless possibilities to make this a fun and useful thing where users can decide on the level of creepiness themselves. ‘We think that building a tomb always was the ultimate tool to leave your mark on the world’s history so this could be true for the online world as well.’ It will cost $1 a month to preserve the memorial, meaning that arrangements may have to be made after death for it to survive. But the first 500 people to sign up will get an ‘everlasting memorial’ within the EverTomb ‘cemetery’. The team plans to present the first working version of EverTomb this spring. While the service may be largely satirical, it may cause some people to think about the permanence of their presence online. Serious proposals to manage an individual's online presence after they die, include appointing a 'digital executor' to manage social media accounts and using a password manager service to keep all pins under digital lock and key, so when the time comes, they can all be accessed.","US-based EverTomb service lets users to set up an 'online tomb'

"The girlfriend of one of Britain's biggest drug barons helped him run his international cocaine empire from her home in a picturesque town in the Cotswolds, a court heard. Anni Rowland worked as a personal assistant for convicted drug smuggler Kevin Hanley and arranged his travel, meetings and money transfers from her home, it is claimed.

Hanley's organisation broken up in 2012 after a National Crime Agency surveillance operation led to the arrest of his gang and the seizure of £2.5million of cocaine and £2million in cash. Police who raided the Chelsea home of Hanley's co-conspirator John Fowler also found £100,000 of amphetamines and £61,000 of skunk cannabis. Rowland was involved in the conspiracy with Greek television presenter Chrysi Minadaki, 45, who has also been jailed for her role in the conspiracy, the Old Bailey heard today. The 52-year-old, who is the mother of Hanley's child, commuted between her home in Stow-on-the-Wold, Gloucestershire, and London for her role in the conspiracy, the jury was told. She is on trial with Samson Karahassan, 59, who is said to be the manager of the Southall based fruit company Paris Weston, which was the front for the drug operation. Prosecutor Richard Jory said the drugs ring involved dozens of people across the world and was ‘well planned and well organised'.

The cocaine began its journey in Venezuela before travelling to Greece where it was packed into loads of fruit and vegetables bound for the UK. Mr Jory said Rowland ‘was a personal assistant to Hanley who was the main organiser of this conspiracy'. She booked flights and accommodation for Hanley and Fowler around Europe. ‘She made charges for payment where money became due. She arranged for the transfer of money to Hanley and she occasionally attended meetings with him.’ The prosecutor added that Karahassan acted 'in a supervisory capacity'. 'His task was to sell the large amount of fruit and vegetables after it had been used as a cover load for the drugs,’ Mr Jory said. Rowland denies conspiracy to supply cocaine amphetamines, cannabis and money laundering. Karahassan, from London, denies conspiracy to supply the drugs. Fowler, 58, was earlier jailed for 17 years and Minadaki was sentenced to 16 years in prison. The trial continues.

"Wouldn't pay: Tony Rooke (pictured at Horsham Magistrates' Court today), did not want to give money to an organisation 'funding the practice of terrorism' A 49-year-old man refused to pay his TV licence because he believed the BBC covered up facts about the 9/11 terrorist attacks. Tony Rooke, who represented himself today at Horsham Magistrates’ Court in West Sussex, said he did not want to give money to an organisation 'funding the practice of terrorism'. Rooke, who admitted owning a TV and watching it without a licence, was found guilty of using an unlicensed set, given a six-month conditional discharge and told to pay £200 costs. He was visited in May 2012 by an inspector after withdrawing his licence in March, but said he was withholding the funds under the Terrorism Act. Section 15 of the 2000 Act states that it is an offence for someone to invite another to provide money, intending that it should be used, or having reasonable cause to suspect that it may be used, for terrorism purposes. 'I am withholding all funds from the BBC, the Government and subsidiaries under Section 15 of the Terrorism Act,’ he told the inspector. He added that he had already lodged a complaint with the BBC. Rooke told the court: 'I believe the BBC, who are directly funded by the licence fee, are furthering the purposes of terrorism and I have incontrovertible evidence to this effect. I do not use this word lightly given where I am.' He was not allowed to show his pre-prepared video evidence in court because the District Judge said it was not relevant to the trial. But the major point Rooke said he relied upon was that the BBC allegedly reported that World Trade Centre 7 had fallen 20 minutes before it did. Fan base: Around 100 supporters of Tony Rooke arrived at Horsham Magistrates' Court in West Sussex to watch the court case - although only 40 could pack into the public gallery . He also made reference to a theory about the way the skyscraper was said to have fallen in on itself, which some people believe showed signs of a controlled demolition. Mr Rooke said: 'The BBC reported it 20 . minutes before it fell. They knew about it beforehand. Last time I was . here I asked you (the judge): “Were you aware of World Trade Centre 7”? Happy: Speaking outside court, Rooke said he was 'pleased' with the outcome, 'all things considered' ‘You said you had heard of it. Ten years later you should have more than heard of it. It's the BBC's job to inform the public. Especially of miracles of science and when laws of physics become suspended. ‘They have made programmes making fools of and ridiculing those of us who believe in the laws of gravity. American reports have shown that the fall was nothing but a controlled demolition. ‘I am not looking at who demolished it - that is impossible - but the BBC actively tried to hide this from the public.' Not paying a TV licence under Section 363 of the Communications Act is a strict liability offence, said Garth Hanniford, prosecuting. He asked Rooke why he continued to watch the BBC with no licence. Rooke said: 'Ignorance is not an excuse - I need to know what these people are saying.' He later added: 'You are asking me to commit a crime if you are asking me to pay.' Around 100 supporters arrived at Horsham Magistrates’ Court today to watch the court case - although only 40 could pack into the public gallery. The court called in back-up from Sussex Police with two officers standing at the door to the court and several more outside. There was cheering and applause as Rooke put his case forward in court. Flashback: This is a grab from BBC World's breaking news coverage of the September 11 attacks in 2001 . District Judge Stephen Nicholls said: 'This is not a public inquiry into 9/11. This is an offence under section 363 of the Communications Act.' He said he had difficulty sitting in the . magistrates’ court as he 'did not believe he had the power to rule under . the terrorism act'. 'I believe the BBC, who are directly funded by the licence fee, are furthering the purposes of terrorism and I have incontrovertible evidence to this effect. I do not use this word lightly given where I am' Tony Rooke . He said: 'Even if I accept the evidence you say, this court has no power to create a defence in the manner which you put forward.' Sentencing, Judge Nicholls said: 'Mr Rooke puts the basis of his defence under Section 15 of the Terrorism Act, effectively asking the court to find the BBC is a terrorist organisation and that if he continues to pay them he himself is committing a criminal offence. 'I have explained to Mr Rooke even if I were to accept his evidence I would be unable to find a defence.' Speaking outside court, Rooke said he was 'pleased' with the outcome, 'all things considered'.","Tony Rooke represented himself at Horsham Magistrates' Court in Sussex .

"A couple appeared in court in France yesterday accused of stashing some £50 million-worth of stolen Picasso art treasures in their garage. Pierre Le Guennec, 74, and his wife Danielle, 73, face up to 10 years in prison for handling the goods, but insist that they were all ‘presents’ from the legendary Spanish artist. It was in November 2010 that 271 lithographs, cubist paintings, notebooks and a watercolour were found at their modest home in Mouans-Sartoux, in the South of France. Danielle and Pierre Le Guennec arrive at court for the beginning of their trial in which they stand accused of stashing stolen Picasso treasures . A painting of a hand by Picasso that was among 271 undocumented, never-before-seen works estimated to be worth at least £50million . A painting 'Still life glass sand' and a drawing 'Nu Assis (Sitting nude)' which feature among the 271 hitherto unseen works by Picasso produced by the artist's odd job man . In a court in nearby Grasse lawyers for six of Picasso’s descendants accused them of hiding the ‘fraudulently obtained’ haul. Mr Le Guennec, 75, claims he was given the collection by the artist and his second wife, Jacqueline, when he was an odd job man at their home in Notre-Dame-de-Vie in Mougins, near Cannes. Mr Le Guennec installed a burglar alarm at the luxury villa before the artist died in 1973, and said he accepted them as ‘thank you’ gifts. Referring to Picasso, Mr Le Guennec said he ‘often invited me in to have some cake or a coffee. Me and the master talked about all things great and small. One evening, I was leaving my work, when Madame handed me a little package saying: ""This is for you"".' But Claude Picasso, the artist’s son, said that his father was noted for his generosity, but that he always dedicated, dated and signed his gifts, as he knew that some recipients might try to sell the works one day. Jean-Jacques Neuer, Claude Picasso’s barrister, said: ‘They don’t remember whether they received the so called gift in 1970, 71 or 72. If you are given 271 Picassos, you remember it. ‘You have to imagine that Picasso kept hold of them for 70 years and suddenly decided to give the lot away. That’s doesn’t make sense.’ Picasso pictured two years before he died in 1973. His works are the most stolen of any artist in history . Claude and Maya Ruiz-Picasso, Pablo Picasso's son and daughter, pictured outside court yesterday . The only document with the name Le Guennec on is a signed brochure for a Picasso exhibition, said Mr Neuer. adding: ‘When you give a present, you choose something precise that fits the person. ‘Picasso here is giving away works that have nothing to do with each other - notably extremely precious cubist collages that represent 10 per cent of his production,’ he said. ‘But also two notebooks of drawings, work tools that he would never have given away. The issue is not whether Picasso was generous or not. Picasso wasn’t someone who was careless about his works – he didn’t give away just for the sake of it.’ Charles-Etienne Gudin, lawyer for the couple, said the works came from the artist’s ‘Grands-Augustins’ studio on Paris’s Left Bank. He said that Mr Le Guennec would never have stolen the Picasso’s villa, describing it as a ‘fortress’ watched over night and day by security guards. The trial, which is due to last three weeks, comes after Marina Picasso, the artist’s granddaughter, said she was selling off the famous villa, along with a selection of his work, for up to £190m. Ms Picasso wrote a memoir ‘Picasso: My Grandfather’ in 2001, in which she accused him of destroying her childhood. Picasso’s works are the most stolen of any artist in history. He has more than 1,000 paintings registered as taken unlawfully, missing or disputed. Another Picasso drawing, this time of a horse, from Pierre Le Guennec's collection that he kept in his garage .

"Taiwan's aviation authority has suspended 29 TransAsia Airways pilots a week after one of their planes crashed into a river and killed at least 42 people. 10 of the airline's pilots were barred from flying after failed a proficiency test and 19 others are suspended until they take it. They were among 49 pilots who were ordered to take an oral exam on handling emergency situations following the tragic crash in China on February 4. Tragedy: 29 TransAsia pilots have been suspended for failing proficiency tests after one of their planes (pictured) crashed into the Keelung River in China last week . Fatal: At least 42 people died after Flight 235 clipped a bridge and smashed into the muddy river shortly after taking off from Taipei airport . Failure: The Civil Aviation Administration has said all pilots who failed the proficiency test in the wake of the February 4 tragedy will need to be retrained . Hope: Although 42 people tragically died aboard the plane, 15 of the 58 people on board were rescued and one person is still missing . The Civil Aviation Administration has said all pilots who failed the test will need to be retrained. TransAsia Airways flight 235 crashed into the muddy Keelung River minutes after taking off from Taipei Songshan Airport. One of its wings smashed into a bridge before the plane broke into several massive pieces and spread wreckage across the river. 15 of the 58 people on board were rescued and one person is still missing. A preliminary investigation indicated the plane's pilots shut off a running engine after its other engine died - a decision aviation experts have since said was an error. TransAsia has said the pilots undergoing retraining have an average of almost 7,000 hours of flying time each. Overseas flight safety experts have now been contacted and the airline will begin more training on simulators next month, it added. Human error: A preliminary investigation indicated the plane's pilots shut off a running engine after its other engine died - a decision aviation experts have since said was a mistake . Defence: TransAsia has said the pilots undergoing retraining after the crash have an average of almost 7,000 hours of flying time each. Deceased: Three bodies were recovered on February 7 (pictured) after the plane carrying 53 passengers and five crew crashed four days earlier . The airline says it has distributed 1.2million Taiwan dollars - around £25,000 - to cover funeral expenses for the families of the 12 Taiwanese victims and 13 from mainland China. Another 51 people have received compensation of around 200,000 Taiwan dollars - or £4,100. The crash was the second fatal accident involving a TransAsia flight in less than a year and raised serious questions about the airline's corporate culture. Over the weekend, Taiwanese Premier Mao Chi-kuo said Taiwan needs to look at improving training in civil aviation once all the victims have been accounted for.","10 TransAsia pilots failed the exam one week after tragic plane crash .

"Thanks to celebrities like Cara Delevingne and the Duchess of Cambridge, bold, defined eyebrows are coveted by many young women. It was a look that student Sarah, 24, from Bath, wanted but she became sick of spending hours with an eyebrow pencil to get the shape just right every day. 'Every morning was daunting - drawing them on and feeling depressed if they didn't look right,' she told Channel 4 show Bodyshockers. Scroll down for video . Sarah, 24, from Bath, became sick of spending hours with an eyebrow pencil every morning so she took drastic action and had them tattooed on . The tattoos were darker than she expected and make her look 'constantly surprised' So Sarah took drastic action by having dark eyebrows tattooed on to her face. But she now admits it hasn't given her the results she desired. She said: 'Having the tattoos was excruciating. I told the tattooist I wanted black eyebrows but I didn't think they would be this black. 'I don't know what I was thinking as I'm naturally blonde.' The student, who lives in Leicester, had to dye her hair brown and cut a chunky fringe in an attempt to make her bold brow less noticeable. The student had a fringe cut to try and hide her tattoos and had to pencil them in when they started fading and turning blue in colour . Sarah said she now finds her appearance embarrassing as her eyebrows make her look 'constantly surprised.' The move hasn't saved her time on her morning beauty regime as hoped either, as she still has to use her eyebrow pencil because the tattoos have started to turn blue as they've faded. In addition, she has to spend longer doing her hair to ensure they're not on show. She said: 'It was supposed to be a quick fix so I didn't have to do all this plucking, shaving and painting them on. 'But now before I leave the house I have to spend ages doing hair to make sure they can't be seen.' Sarah had been trying to emulate the defined brows of Cara Delevingne, left, and the Duchess of Cambridge . Sarah added that the tattoos have also made her feel self-conscious, so she's not as sociable as she used to be. She said: 'I don't tend to go out much now as I have it in my head that people are looking at me - that's most upsetting. 'I want them gone'. She is hoping to eventually achieve this by having painful laser removal surgery.

"When Australian actor Damon Gameau found out he was going to be a father, he put his body on the line to find out the effects sugar can have on a person's health and well-being. The question of what he was going to feed his little girl in her school lunch box prompted him to embark on a radical diet to measure the impact sugars in so-called 'healthy foods' can have on the body. The Underbelly star only ate foods equivalent to 40 teaspoons of sugar a day - the average amount most Australians eat each day - for two months. He stuck to low fat foods and drinks perceived to be healthy, including muesli bars, low-fat yoghurt, cereal and juices. Damon Gameau embarked on a radical diet to measure the impact sugars in so-called 'healthy foods' can have on the body when his girlfriend Zoe Tuckwell-Smith was pregnant with their daughter Velvet . But the outcome, captured in That Sugar Film, shocked Gameau, his then pregnant Winners & Losers girlfriend Zoe Tuckwell-Smith  and the number of medical professionals involved in the experiment. The 38-year-old stacked on 8.5kg in 60 days and 10cm of visceral fat around his stomach. 'Within a month I was on the verge of being diabetic… I was very close to my liver getting cirrhosis. I was on the verge of obesity for my size. I hit that risk point,' he told Daily Mail Australia. 'It was a complete shock, I had no knowledge of nutrition. I didn't think I'd have these results.' The 38-year-old actor, who had 40 teaspoons of sugar a day for 60 days, stacked on 8.5kg in 60 days and 10cm of visceral fat around his stomach . He stuck to low fat foods and drinks perceived to be healthy, including muesli bars, low-fat yoghurt, cereal and juices and documented the results in his new film That Sugar Film . Within a month, the Underbelly actor says he was on the verge of being diabetic and obese and was very close to getting liver cirrhosis . He was shocked to find drinks like ice tea, vitamin waters, smoothies and sports drinks often had as much sugar as a can of coke. Low fat mayonnaise, BBQ sauce and baked beans were also a major shock. When Gameau started dating Tuckwell-Smith, 32, in 2008, he  gave up alcohol, cigarettes and sugar in a bid to impress her. So when he re-introduced refined sugar after three years, Gameau said he immediately noticed the impact it had on his mental and physical well-being - he was moody, lethargic and temperamental. But after the 60 days were up and he went back to his whole food diet, Gameau said 90 percent of the weight fell right off just from cutting out the refined sugar.

Gameau and Tuckwell-Smith, who welcomed their baby girl Velvet midway through the sugar experiment, now regularly draw on the experience when the family prepares meals. The couple rarely feed Velvet products with refined sugar and hope to move her away from sweet foods. 'We don’t want to give her an eating disorder,' he said. 'Zoe and I get the sugar we need from fruits… I think from my experience the palate does adjust. If you teach them the definition of sweet it doesn’t need to come from a Kit Kat. 'I hope with our daughter the sweetness (cravings) can come from fruit. 'We have a strong focus on being clean and leading a healthy life. She could learn that by copying us rather than us telling her.'

When it comes time for Gameau and Tuckwell-Smith to pack 14-month-old Velvet's lunch box, the pair are loading it with boiled eggs, carrot sticks, cheese and fruit . Gameau said he hopes his daughter Velvet will copy her parent's healthy lifestyle as they try to steer her away from foods with added sugar . In his film, Gameau made a point of consuming his 40 teaspoons of sugar in one sitting just from foods often found in a child's lunch box - museli bars, fruit juice and yoghurt were all on the menu. But when it comes time for Gameau and Tuckwell-Smith to pack 14-month-old Velvet's lunch box, the pair are adamant they'll steer clear of such foods. 'Boiled eggs, carrot sticks with hommos, cheese – there are so many options. It’s just about being creative and not believing the marketing ploys,' he said.

"The unemployed should be forced to take a job after no more than two years on the dole to end stop them spending a 'lifetime on benefits', Labour will say today. Rachel Reeves is challenging David Cameron to back Labour's plan for a jobs guarantee to limit Jobseekers Allowance to a year for under 25s and two years for older workers. In a letter to the Prime Minister, the shadow work and pensions secretary warned the country cannot afford leaving people 'stuck on benefits for years on end'. Scroll down for video . Shadow work and pensions secretary Rachel Reeves is challenging David Cameron to back Labour's plan for a jobs guarantee to limit Jobseekers Allowance to a year for under 25s and two years for older workers . Latest figures show the number of people claiming JSA stood at 867,700 in December, down from 1.6million in 2011 but still 90,000 higher than the pre-crash trough in February 2008. However, there are 133,200 people aged 25 and over who have been claiming JSA for two years or more, and 30,000 people aged 18-24 have been on JSA for over a year. Under Labour's plan, the government would force those on the scheme to take a job working 25 hours a week, paid at the minimum wage, for six months. The party hopes that four in five people would be kept on by employers in the job after six months. It would be paid for using £1.9billion raised through a levy on bankers' bonuses, although the Tories claim it would cost £2.5billion. There are 133,200 people aged 25 and over who have been claiming JSA for two years or more, and 30,000 people aged 18-24 have been on JSA for over a year . MPs will debate and vote on the proposal in a debate in the Commons today. In a letter sent to Mr Cameron, seen by MailOnline, Miss Reeves calls on the government to back the idea. She writes: 'Abandoning people to a lifetime on benefits is not only bad for individuals and their families, but bad for the economy, and bad for the taxpayer who foots the bill. 'With youth unemployment up over the past quarter, the need to tackle this issue and get people off benefits and into work is even more urgent.' She tells Mr Cameron: 'It's time to put an end to your government's rules which allow jobseekers to spend a lifetime on benefits without being offered a day's paid work.' She says the figures show that the number of over-25s on benefits for more than two years has risen by 224 per cent since 2010. 'By a one-off repeat of the tax on banker's bonuses and restricting pension tax relief on incomes over £150,000, the Government could fully fund a Compulsory Jobs Guarantee to ensure that anyone 25 and over receiving JSA for two years and over, and anyone under 25 who has been receiving JSA for over a year, would be offered a paid job that they will have to take or face losing benefits. 'This is a tough but fair contract, because as a country we simply cannot afford to continue wasting the potential of so many, leaving them stuck on benefits for years on end.' But a Tory party source said: 'Labour's sums don't add up. They are proposing yet more unfunded spending, meaning more borrowing and more taxes to pay for it. And Labour's bank tax is a short-term political gimmick that they want to spend at least ten times over. 'It's the same old Labour. Ed Miliband has no economic plan. Labour would put the recovery at risk, put jobs at risk and hardworking people would pay the price with a less secure future.' Tory leader David Cameron has promised to end jobless benefits for the under-21 as part of an ambition for full employment . Mr Cameron has set out a Tory ambition for 'full employment', claiming it means 'more of our fellow men and women with the security of a regular wage; it means you, your family and your children having a job and getting on in life'. The Conservatives have committed to banning under-21s from claiming benefits, with requirement that they are 'earning or learning'. 'No longer will you have the option of leaving school and going straight into a life on benefits', Mr Cameron said last year. In her letter to Mr Cameron, Ms Reeves says: 'You recently set out your aim for Britain to become a nation of 'full employment', but despite recent welcome falls in overall unemployment the number of people out of work (25 and over) and claiming benefits for over two years is 224 per cent higher than in 2010. 'I hope you will therefore support Labour and back a Compulsory Jobs Guarantee. It's time to put an end to your government's rules which allow jobseekers to spend a lifetime on benefits without being offered a day's paid work.'","Shadow work and pensions secretary calls for time limit on benefit claims .

"Thousands of Jordanian troops have been deployed to the country's border with Iraq to stop Islamic State militants from infilatrating the country, it has been reported. The country has already carried out airstrikes on ISIS targets in revenge for the murder of Jordanian pilot Moaz al Kasasbeh, who was burned alive in a cage as masked militants in camouflage uniforms looked on. After a video was released showing the death of the airman, Jordan's King Abdullah vowed to wage a harsh war against the terror group and in a statement, he pledged to hit the militants 'hard in the very centre of their strongholds'. A Jordanian soldier pictured on patrol in Amman earlier today. It has been reported that the country is to move thousands of its troops to its border with Iraq . Now two Jordanian government officials have told NBC News that thousands of troops have been moved to the Iraqi border in a bid to ramp up the campaign against ISIS. The sources, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, also added that soldiers were being sent there as a 'show of force.' Earlier this week, the Jordanian air force unleashed three consecutive days of attacks on ISIS targets with the strikes - dubbed Operation Martyr Moaz in the pilot's memory - targeting the terror group's weapon depots, training centres, warehouses and military barracks. The focus of Jordan's airstrikes are reported to be Raqqa, the ISIS stronghold in Syria. The intensified air assaults come almost one week after the extremists released the chilling footage of the airman's death, which sparked protests throughout Jordan. Jordan has carried out 56 aerial bombings on Islamic State targets in revenge for the murder of Jordanian pilot Moaz al Kasasbeh. Pictured: Aerial strike from video released last week by officials . A squadron of United Arab Emirates F-16 fighters has arrived in one of Jordan's air bases to support it in strikes against the Islamic State group . Entitled 'Healing the Believers' Chests', the 22-minute film showed the captured airman wearing an orange jumpsuit and being seemingly doused in fuel, as a trail of petrol leading up to the iron bars of the cage is set alight. Officials believe Kasasbeh had been killed almost one month earlier, despite ISIS attempting to carry out a prisoner exchange in return for the stricken pilot. After the footage was released, Jordanian officials promised to retaliate harshly and quickly executed two Iraqi militants connected with ISIS. This included Sajida al-Rishawi, the female would-be suicide bomber whose freedom ISIS had originally demanded in exchange for releasing Kasasbeh. King Abdullah II later said Jordan's response would 'be harsh because this terrorist organisation is not only fighting us, but also fighting Islam and its pure values.' King Abdullah is briefed by the Supreme Commander of Staff General Mashal Mohammad Al Zabin on airstrikes carried out by the country . Brutal: ISIS released footage purportedly showing the 26-year-old pilot being burned to death in a cage . In a statement, he pledged to hit the militants 'hard in the very centre of their strongholds'. ISIS seized control of large areas of Iraq and Syria last year, prompting hundreds of raids by coalition war planes. The United States and several Arab allies, including Jordan, have been striking ISIS in Syria since September 23. Warplanes from the U.S. and other countries have been waging an air campaign against the extremists in Iraq for even longer. The campaign aims to push back the jihadi organisation after it took large parts of Iraq and Syria and declared a 'caliphate.'","Sources say Jordanian troops have been deployed to border with Iraq .

"For most people, swimming with whales is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity - but not if you've grown up like these children. From as young age age four, these kids have grown up alongside the majestic mammals. It all began when British underwater camera operator, Darren Rice, moved from the UK to Tonga to oversee the Matafonua resort with his wife, Nina. Scroll down for video . For most people, swimming with humpback whales is a once-in-a-lifetime experience, but not if you've grown up like the Rice children . Darren Rice and his wife Nine have raised their three children in Tonga and encouraged them to mingle with marine animals. Pictured: JJ (aged 9) and Lily (aged 6) swimming with humpback whales . It's there where his three children, JJ, aged nine, Abbie, aged eight and Lily, aged six, have had the opportunity to mingle with marine animals in water as shallow as 500m deep. While many parents would be reluctant to let their children swim with 40 tonne humpback whales, Darren insists that his kids are safe. He said: 'The whales are very gentle and accommodating. I have noted over the years that they enjoy interacting with children, especially the mothers with young babies of their own. There is no danger. 'As a resort we specialise in taking people out everyday during the season to swim with the whales.' And the whales are as gentle and accommodating as the children are! Here, the marine mammals get close to JJ during a swim in 2012 . The resort that the Rice's operate specialises in taking visitors out to swim with whales, which Darren insists is perfectly safe . The proud dad wouldn't dream of putting his kids in danger and insists that the company takes about 500 people out per year to swim . 'We are one of the few places in the world where this is permitted,' he added. 'I have been an underwater cameraman now for 20 years and wouldn't dream of placing my children in any danger. 'We take about 500 people a year to swim with the whales without incident.' Each year the humpback whales return to waters surrounding Foa Island, where the resort is based, to mate and give birth. And Darren's three children have been present in the ocean to witness such miraculous events. The children have even formed a special bond with two of the whales, which they have nicknamed Narla and Geraldine. Each year, the humpback whales return to the waters surrounding Foa Island, where the resort is based, to mate and to give birth . When the children aren't playing with the majestic marine mammals, they are often spotted snorkelling in the clear waters. Pictured: Abbie (aged 8) swimming on Foa Island . Time of their lives! Here, Abbie poses for the camera with a humpback whale behind her in the shallow waters . Darren said: 'They have been here several times with newborn babies and they particularly enjoy the children's company. 'Last year Geraldine kept pushing her new baby boy over toward the children encouraging him to interact. 'We see lots of the same whales every year. Mothers with newborns tend to visit the same nursery areas to give birth and to nurse.' Darren and Nina Rice pose with their three children: Lily, Abbie and JJ outside the resort that they manage in Matafonua, Tonga . The children have even been present for the birthing of whales, so it's no surprise they've formed a special bond with two of the mammals . These children enjoy spending time engaging in a wide range of water activities, especially JJ who loves to go paddleboarding . Darren adds that while the children love to spend time with the whales, they always keep a safe distance because the babies can be 'clumsy' But Darren and his young charges are always careful to give the mammals their much-needed space. 'We always maintain a safe distance from the whales not because they are a threat but the babies often only weeks old can be very clumsy and when a five tonne baby gets clumsy you don't want to be nearby.'","Darren and Nina Rice are British ex-pats who oversee a resort in Tonga, where whales often come to mate and swim .

"A father-of-three has shed nine stone by smothering his food with chillies and hot sauce in a diet he's described as 'agony'. Phil Zipser, 35, dropped from 26 stone to 17 stone by cutting down on his massive 4,000-calorie daily feeds and tucking into hot and spicy foods instead. The Nottingham lorry driver was forced to lose the excess pounds after developing a series of health problems including a heart condition, arthritis, sleep apnea and diabetes, which doctors said were linked to his  crippling obesity. Father-of-three Phil Zipser, from Nottingham, lost an incredibly nine stone after eating a diet of chillies . Phil says eating the chillies can be agony but it is worth it because he has lost so much weight and improved his health . His big reveal comes in the same week that scientists in the US revealed proof that capsaicin - the active component - found in chillies, boosts calorie-burning. Yet Phil, who became  convinced of the fat-busting qualities of chillies more than a year ago, was ahead of the curve. And now he routinely covers all his meals in extreme hot sauce and even snacks on raw chillies and jalapeno peppers to boost his metabolism. He said: 'I bought the hottest chili sauce I could find - it's made out of ghost peppers which are extremely spicy. 'It's agony eating such hot food - but it has helped me shift the pounds.' Phil - who lives with his partner of 17 years Helen Capewell, 34, and their three children Shane, 17, Aleisha, 5, and Lucy, one - feared he'd die early if he didn't change his diet. Lorry driver Phil says he would sit in front of the television eating unhealthy food and consuming large amounts of alcohol . Phil poses with his family on a trip to the seaside, he says he was told he would die if he didn't lose weight . At his heaviest he consumed more than 4,000 calories a day, including four cans of cider and a bottle of wine each night. 'I was drinking cider every night and eating crisps and chocolate all day - it's a killer,' he said. 'I had developed so many health conditions because of my weight. The doctor told me if I didn't do something about my weight, I would die. 'I used to sit in front of the TV and watch films or soaps with a few cans. I never went down the pub as I was too embarrassed to go out as I was so big. 'I have always struggled with my weight - I was even fat when I was a baby. But I was in denial about how much I ate. I thought I was just unlucky. 'I went to the doctors on my birthday in 2013 and they told me my illnesses were getting worse. My wife and kids were with me and I looked at them and knew I had to change.' Breakfast: Sugary cereal . Lunch: Two pre-packaged sandwiches . Dinner: Pizza . Snacks and drinks: Crisps, chocolate, four cans of cider and a bottle of wine a night . Breakfast: Spicy Noodles . Lunch:  Spicy Noodles . Dinner: Salmon and new potatoes . Snacks and drinks: Weight Watchers crisps, raw chillies and spicy peppers . After starting on his diet Phil now has a healthy dinner of salmon and salad . Desperate to lose weight, Phil discovered that eating spicy chillies could help him lose excess weight. He started on a strict calorie-controlled diet, enlivened with chillies, peppers and hot sauce. According to new research by the University of Wyoming capsaicin, the chemical which gives chillies their characteristic fiery taste, stimulates a natural process where calories are automatically converted into heat, preventing calories from being stored as fat. He said: 'When I was at my heaviest, I couldn't even walk upstairs. I was dangerously close to having a heart attack. Losing the weight was tough. 'I covered everything I ate with the ghost pepper sauce. Raw chillies and peppers also helped. They are low in calories, but don't exactly taste very nice. My whole face goes bright red, and I start sweating, so I can feel it working. 'There were times when I wished I was tucking into a spicy curry, but most curries are far too creamy, so not very good for you.' Phil had put on so much weight that he was suffering from a heart condition and couldn't walk up stairs . Phil, who's waist has shrunk from 54in to 40in, holds up a pair of his old trousers . Within one year and one month Phil dropped from a size XXXXXL to XL T-shirt size and had shrunk from a 54in waist to a 40in waist. Before his weight loss he ate sugary cereal for breakfast, two pre-packaged sandwiches for lunch and a pizza for dinner. During the day he would snack on crisps. Now Phil has spicy noodles for breakfast, the same noodles for lunch and salmon and new potatoes for dinner. For snacks he dips into bags of weight-watchers crisps and munches on raw chillies and spicy peppers. He said: 'Since I lost the weight my diabetes has stabilised and my sleep apnea has gone. My heart condition should get better as I lose more weight. 'The most important thing now is I can play with my kids. We can go out for a walk in the park at the weekend. We can go out to eat as a family as well. 'I used to struggle to fit in the chairs in restaurants. I'm still losing weight. I never want to be as big as I was before.'","Spice fan Phil Zipser, 35, lost 9st after ditching 4,000-calorie a day diet .

"Wisconsin Gov. and rising Republican star Scott Walker refused on Wednesday to say whether he believes in evolution during a Q and A at a London think tank. After declining to answer numerous questions related to foreign policy, out of respect for the sitting President of the United States, the likely presidential candidate evaded the event moderator's question about evolution, telling him, 'For me, I am going to punt on that one as well.' 'That's a question a politician shouldn't be involved in one way or the other,' he added. Scroll down for video . 'That's a question a politician shouldn't be involved in one way or the other,' Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker said of evolution on Wednesday during an appearance at London-based think tank Chatham House . Even after his interviewer, Justin Webb of BBC Radio 4, asserted that 'any British politician right or left wing would laugh and say, ""yes of course evolution's true,"" ' Walked stood his ground. 'I'm here to talk about trade, not to pontificate on other issues,' he said, heartily adding, to laughter, 'I love the issue of trade in Wisconsin.' Recently elected to his second term as governor in The Badger State after surviving a recall challenge in his first term, Walker is now on the path to the GOP nomination for president. He has been making the rounds in early presidential states such as Iowa, where he reportedly leased office space this week, and is currently on a trip to the U.K. After fellow presumed Republican presidential contender Chris Christie's disastrous trip to England last week that involved the cancellation of several press conferences after the New Jersey politician came under attack in the U.S. for his lavish spending and his position on mandatory vaccinations, Walker's team said the Wisconsin governor would take no questions from reporters while abroad. The only exception was to be today's speech at Chatham House, an international affairs institute, followed by a sit down interview with Webb. But even then, Walker was not inclined to give direct answers to many of the questions put before him, according to reporters present. The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel said Walker excused himself from commenting on world affairs because he holds the 'old-fashioned' view that it's not appropriate  to 'talk about foreign policy while you're on foreign soil.' 'I don't think it's wise to undermine your own president' on trips such as these, he later said. Officially in Britain as part of a taxpayer-funded trade mission, the UK visit is widely seen as an opportunity for Walker to bulk up his foreign policy credentials before he formally announces a presidential bid. On Tuesday the Republican governor met with British Prime Minister David Cameron. Today he paid a visit to the speaker of the House of Commons, John Bercow. During the trip he also visited a Harley-Davidson dealership - the company was founded in Wisconsin, and stopped by the grave of British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, a conservative icon, to pay his respects. Walker is pictured leaving 10 Downing street after a private meeting with British Prime Minister David Cameron in London on Tuesday. Walker is leading a coalition of Wisconsin government and business officials on a trade mission that runs until Friday. The trip gives him a chance to bolster his overseas and foreign policy credentials as he considers running for president in 2016 . Walker is not alone among the probable GOP presidential candidates in his hesitancy to take a stance on evolution. Former governors Rick Perry of Texas and Bobby Jindal of Louisiana have both waffled when asked about the scientific origins of creation. Christie has also been won't to discuss the subject or anything related to foreign policy. Still, the Democratic National Committee took a shot at Walker on Wednesday afternoon over the ducking and dodging. 'For someone who went to London to build his street cred as a serious leader all Walker showed today was the same ducking and dodging Wisconsinites know all too well and that we’ve come to expect from the 2016 GOP field, whose policy positions are just too divisive to share,' the DNC's National Press Secretary, Holly Shulman, said in an email to reporters. 'Would’ve been a lot simpler to just stay home,' she added. In a separate email later in the day, DNC Communications Director Mo Elleithee trolled the Republican field and asked, 'Do any other GOP presidential candidates want to go to London? 'If so, let us know. The DNC is more than happy to pick up your travel costs,' Elleithee said.","'That's a question a politician shouldn't be involved in one way or the other,' Walker said during an appearance at Chatham House .
He also declined to answer numerous questions related to foreign policy; 'I don't think it's wise to undermine your own president' on foreign soil .

"Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security's Anthony Byrne said women travelling to the middle east to become jihadi brides 'are being passed around as sex slaves after their partners are killed' Australian women heading to Syria and Iraq as brides for members of the terrorist organisation Islamic State are being turned into sex slaves once their husbands die. Intelligence information has revealed that a number of Australian women that travelled to Syria have suffered this fate, prompting officials to warn others against following in their footsteps, according to News Corp. 'Our information is that women are being passed around as sex slaves after their partners are killed,' Anthony Byrne, the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security's deputy chair told the Daily Telegraph. 'They are literally selling women for sex. Young Australian women should know that it's not an adventure… it's a slave trade.' It comes after a pamphlet outlining ISIS' 'laws' on sex slaves was released by The Research and Fatwa Department of the Islamic State. Published in full by the Jihad and Terrorism Threat Monitor, the list of 'Questions and Answers on Taking Captives and Slaves' states that it is acceptable to have sexual intercourse with children, beat female slaves and sell them. 'It is permissible to buy, sell, or give as a gift female captives and slaves, for they are merely property, which can be disposed of as long as that doesn't cause [the Muslim ummah] any harm or damage,' the rules state. It comes after a pamphlet outlining ISIS' 'laws' on sex slaves revealed it is acceptable for members to have sexual intercourse with children . 'It is permissible to have intercourse with the female slave who hasn't reached puberty if she is fit for intercourse; however if she is not fit for intercourse, then it is enough to enjoy her without intercourse.' The list of prices that women are being sold at by the terrorist organisation was also made public by Iraqi News in November last year. It revealed that girls between the ages of one and nine were priced at about 200,000 Iraqi dinars, just over $200. Between 10 and 20-years-old, a woman is listed as being worth 150,000 dinars and from between 20 and 30 years they are sold for $100,000 dinars ($100 AU).

"She's the Perth mum who made a kitchen appliance that costs as much as a week in Bali so popular in Australia. Former mining consultant Grace Mazur has opened up about how she turned the controversial Thermomix cooking device into a cult success - as she announced a $1 million donation to the Murdoch Children's Research Institute. Her company sold 80,000 devices in Australia in 2014 - despite an angry backlash from customers, upset that the first model released in years, the TM5, allegedly went to market without warning. 'It was a bit challenging,' Ms Mazur, the managing director of Thermomix in Australia, said of the incident. Perth mum Grace Mazur, left, is the driving force behind Thermomix in Australia. Ms Mazur today donated $1 million to the Murdoch Children's Research Institute - which Sarah Murdoch is on the board of . The Thermomix, pictured, has an enormous following. But many customers were furious when the company sprung an expensive new model on them without warning . Sunny side up: This was Thermomix in Australia's apology to customers last year . The company was rounded upon by consumer group CHOICE last year after furious customers said the TM5 model was released without warning. A Change.org petition garnered more than 2500 signatures and some customers took the issue to the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission. Ms Mazur said it was an 'honour' that customers were so passionate about Thermomix. 'It's also an honour because we know how passionate our customers and consultants are... You learn from every experience, everything in life that you do'. She first discovered Thermomix while visiting a friend in her native Poland in the year 2000, when she was working as a mining consultant in Perth. 'I went to (visit) a friend of mine... She wasn't expecting me. 'Her kids cooked the whole dinner instantly. I was impressed, they sold it to me, seeing what they can do.' The Thermomix is extraordinarily popular and has received positive reviews from CHOICE. But the company's behaviour has been the target of scathing criticism . A cook, surrounded by all of the products she has made with a Thermomix . After returning to Australia, she then negotiated a deal with Vorwek, the manufacturer of the product, for several months. 'It took us awhile to convince the German company. They didn't think there was a market here in Australia.' It took years before the product caught on - with the company selling 50,000 units in its first ten years, but 80,000 last year. The device is popular in Europe - Ms Mazur said 'in Italy, the Thermomix is part of a wedding' - and the company has had more than 200,000 customers in Australia in total. Ms Murdoch said today's donation from Thermomix would go towards current efforts preventing childhood diseases and ailments, including food allergies, obesity and diabetes. 'Our mission is to try and re-educate people about food,' she said, adding that Thermomix had a part in that mission. '(Thermomix is) that easy that your kids can use it, and can be involved in the process about making decisions about what they eat.'","Perth mum and mining worker Grace Mazur is behind the success of Thermomix in Australia .

"Jodhi Meares' fiance Jon Stevens had a police enforced Apprehended Violence Order (AVO) placed against him in court on Thursday, after he was arrested in the early hours of Monday, charged with one count of common assault after alleged confrontation between the pair. Neither Stevens nor Meares were present at Waverley Local Court, where the singer was represented by lawyer Greg Goold. Stevens, 53, remains on police bail and with the interim AVO in place until the matter is heard again on May 18. There are no restrictions in place preventing Stevens from living with his partner at their Point Piper home, as Jodhi Meares, listed as the victim in the matter 'declined to make a statement'. However, he lawyer, Chris Murphy, did issue a statement in which she claimed to hold no fear. 'I am emphatically instructed by Jodhi Meares that she is totally without fear or concerns in relation to any future conduct by the subject of the application Jon Stevens,' he stated. 'I am also instructed by my client that there is absolutely no history of violence in the relationship between them.' However, the court documents state the conditions of bail include that: 'The accused is not to assault, molest, harass, threaten or interfere (with the victim) and not to stalk or intimidate.' Scroll down for video . Calm before the storm: Jodhi Meares and rocker fiance Jon Stevens put up a united front at the David Jones Autumn/Winter launch in Sydney last week. He has been granted police bail and has an interim AVO against him after the common assault case went before court on Thursday . Jodhi Meares' lawyer Chris Murphy posted this statement on her behalf as Jon Stevens' court appearance drew near on Thursday morning . Police granted conditional bail on the basis that Stevens (listed as John Stevenson in the court) has no criminal history and no history of violence. The New Zealand-born Noiseworks rocker was arrested at 4.45am on Monday with the charge sheet reading that between 2.00 and 5.15 he (Stevens) did assault Jodhi Meares. Meantime, Meares' company The Upside has posted an apparent message of support for the designer, following the reports she was assaulted. Following the news, the Instagram account for Jodhi's leisurewear brand The Upside on Thursday morning posted a quote attributed to Kurt Cobain, reading, 'I'd rather be hated for who I am than loved for who I am not.' The second dramatic incident for Jodhi in just eight months (she rolled her Range Rover in Bondi in June and recorded a blood alcohol level of 0.181) will no doubt come as a blow to the socialite and businesswoman, who has been working hard building her active wear label The Upside over the past few years. It seemed like she could finally put the incident behind her last week when she glowed with pride as model Jessica Gomes paraded pieces from The Upside down the runway at the David Jones Autumn/Winter collection launch, Jodhi sipping water and staying close to the side of her fiance throughout the night. Day in court: The Sydney socialite and fashion designer faced court in August over drinking driving charges, after she rolled her Range Rover in Bondi in June and recorded a blood alcohol level 0.181. She was banned from driving for 12 months and received a $1,100 fine. No conviction was recorded . Crash: Jodhi collided with three parked cars when she rolled her Range Rover in Bondi on June 21 last year . Choosing to stick to water was surely no coincidence at the 43-year-old's first public appearance since she faced court in August, the former wife of billionaire James Packer no doubt hoping to repair her image as a clean-living fashionista. In court over the drink driving case, which resulted in Jodhi not having a conviction recorded and receiving a 12-month driving ban and a fine for $1,100, her solicitor Chris Murphy said Meares had been 'haunted' by her marriage to Packer, which lasted from 1999 until they separated in 2002. Incident: In court at the time of the hearing to make a decision on Meares' sentence, her lawyer said the former model weighed about 48.5 kilograms and had drunk 'about four and three-quarter' glasses of red wine over four and a half hours and eaten just a small piece of lamb when she got behind the wheel . 'She was married for just over two years [to James Packer] and that haunts everything that's said about it [the marriage],' he said. 'She's not a celebrity, she's not a movie star. She was raised by a single mother. They moved apartments every four months. There were four children, she went to three different high schools. 'She had the good fortune to make money in modelling, and in the late 90s, she created the label Tiger Lily, and married Jamie Packer.' 'Haunted' by marriage: Also heard in court was how the 43-year-old is 'haunted' by her marriage and subsequent divorce to billionaire James Packer, who she married in 1999 and split from in 2002 . Bikini babe: Jodhi rose to fame as a swimsuit model, and eventually went on to design them with her label Tigerlily, which she founded in 2000 and eventually sold to Billabong in 2007 for an amount estimated by some to be as much as $5 million . And while Jodhi has worked to create a life for herself out of her ex-husband's shadow, the court case also shone a light on how her fashion label is struggling to make money, despite its popularity among style-loving Sydney-siders. Mr Murphy said Ms Meares had not made any money from The Upside, had to pay staff for taking maternity leave and had given any profits to a Cambodian orphans charity, the Cambodian Children's Trust. 'Every garment that is sold by that business, a payment is made to the Cambodian trust,' he said. 'In this particular situation she has a business which is in its early stages, but it doesn't make money - but the cheque goes to the Cambodian orphanage ... with the slum children.' A-list: Jodhi and then husband James in 2001 at a Channel Nine function . Short lived: Sadly the pair were not able to survive the tumultuous time of James' failing One-Tel business, and the pair announced their separation on 2002 . She sold Tigerlily, the swimwear label she founded in 2000 during her marriage to Packer, to surfwear giant Billabong in 2007 for an amount reported to be between $3 and $5 million, staying on as a consultant before eventually cutting ties. Jodhi married James in a lavish ceremony said to have cost $10 million, but memories of the reported 750 guests and private two-hour show by Elton John  couldn't sustain their feelings through three tumultuous years, and the couple split in a blaze of publicity in 2002. The year before, James suffered through the collapse of the communications business One-Tel. Out of his shadow: The brunette formed her own public identity in the wake of the marriage breakdown, becoming one of Sydney's top socialites and making a name for herself as a designer (pictured 2006) Clean living: The passionate yogi and paddle boarder showed off her slender frame at an event in 2010 . Once the fourth-largest telecommunications company in Australia, it collapsed dramatically and ended owing up to $350 million. While the details of her divorce settlement have never been disclosed - and Jodhi has rarely talked about her marriage- the package she walked away with was said to have included a multi-million dollar property portfolio for Jodhi, including a Bronte home she sold for $3.41 million. But life in the spotlight didn't suit Jodhi, who famously failed to show up for the series live finale of Australia's Next Top Model of which she was the host in 2008 because of paralysing stage fright, leaving the late Charlotte Dawson to step in at the eleventh hour and save the day, crowning that year's winner, Demelza Reveley. Bikini body: Her healthy lifestyle shows, with Jodhi revealing flat abs and slender limbs when in swimsuits . Idyllic: Jodhi and Jon have been splitting their time between Sydney and Hawaii, where they share moments from their enviable lifestyle on social media (pictured) Much was made of the incident, but later that year the star was to suffer a devastating loss which would affect her deeply. As the year went on, Jodhi began missing social events and eventually revealed she had been nursing her beloved dog Tenzin, who was suffering from bone cancer. The pup was rumoured to have come from a litter from media mogul and then father-in-law Kerry Packer's rottweiler pet. Tied the knot? Jodhi was happy to wear what appears to be a wedding band next to her engagement ring as she stepped out in Sydney’s Rose Bay on Saturday, two days before the domestic incident with Jon. The couple confirmed their engagement in 2013 but have never confirmed a wedding ceremony . But when adored pup Tenzin, who'd been her constant companion throughout the ups and downs of her very public life since they became pet-and-owner eight years before, succumbed to bone cancer in December, leaving the star distraught. Another turning point came when Jodhi lost her father in 2012, prompting her to make a fresh start in Hawaii. She keeps a home and spends plenty of time there, where Jon proposed in 2013. But what will become of the status of the couple's relationship remains to be seen after Sunday night's incident in which Stevens is accused of assaulting his fiancee. According to reports from Channel Nine, the incident allegedly occurred after the former wife of James Packer discovered text messages on Jon's phone. Jodhi is believed to have sustained minor injuries on her wrist. The Sydney Morning Herald reported the police were called to the couples' home after the fight and immediately issued an interim AVO, forbidding the Jezebal hitmaker from going near Jodhi for 28 days. The former INXS rocker was arrested and charged with assault. The rocker had been due to play several gigs this week, including Rooty Hill RSL on Friday night and Revesby Workers Club on Saturday night, but the shows have now been cancelled, with concert-goers offered refunds.

"A tank belong to a British Army driving school ended up crashing into a house in Germany after a technical fault meant it veered off course. Ulrich and Magdalene Tilsner rushed to their front window after hearing what they thought sounded like a bomb going off outside. But when they pulled back the curtains, they discovered that a British Army owned tank had ploughed into their fence and crushed their hedge.

"A grieving designer has created a weighted blanket that simulates the feeling of being hugged by a loved one. After her fiance's father passed away last summer, Mia Cinelli from Ohio designed The Weight, a 6lb poly-pellet stuffed fleece equipped with arms and hands made to help with the grieving process. 'I carried my grief around with me; my heart was heavy for months,' she explained on her website. 'I wanted to feel his presence, so I made a hand to hold. I welcomed this weight, this semblance of company.' Under pressure: The Weight is a 6lb poly-pellet stuffed fleece equipped with arms and hands designed to help with the grieving process . Painful process: Ohio-based designer Mia Cinelli created the weighted blanket that 'hugs' its users after her fiance's father died last summer . Miss Cinelli, who is an assistant professor of Art & Design at Defiance College, made multiple prototypes before she started researching the psychological benefits of weighted blankets. They are traditionally used in occupational therapy to help comfort those experiencing the stress and anxiety associated with ADD/ADHD, sensory disorders and autism. Miss Cinelli expanded on the concept by adding arms and hands for the user to wrap around themselves and hold. 'In moments of feeling the anxiety that accompanies grief, the weight provides a proprioceptive deep pressure, creating a feeling of presence and calm,' she wrote on her website. 'Its use imitates an intimate gesture, reminiscent of a hug from behind.' She continued: 'When I feel relaxed and take the weight off, I feel lighter - both physically and in spirit.' Cuddle buddy: The Weight can also simulate the feeling of being held while the user is laying down . Holding on: After researching the use of weighted blankets in occupational therapy, Miss Cinelli added hands to her design, enabling users to entwine their fingers with the product . Miss Cinelli is currently exploring the future of her handmade prototype. 'I needed to make it for me first, and now I need to figure out who to make it for next,' she told Dezeen. She continued: 'Is it a custom-made cultural object kept by grieving loved ones? Does it become standard equipment of funeral home directors? Is it an elite object of comfort intertwined with high fashion, or is it sold next to heating pads in pharmacies?' Although she has found comfort in her product, Miss Cinelli said she is aware that others may find the design unsettling. 'I have seen it tagged as #creepy online, and the hands are a bit odd,' she said. 'When I finished it, I couldn't tell if it was too weird or just right, but I think all of my best work falls into that area.' Multiple hugs: Miss Cinelli's product can be draped over the user's body in a variety of ways .

"Instagram account, ByeFelipe, documents some of the worst abusive messages women receive on dating sites, such as Tinder. From threats of violence to comments on bra size, the account is enough to make any woman want to avoid internet dating. But Texan blogger, Karen Cheng, wanted to show that not all Tinder men are bad – and set up a trap to prove her point. Texan blogger, Karen Cheng, wanted to show that not all Tinder men are bad – and set up a trap to prove her point. Pictured above are the common words used in the responses sent by men on the app . She created up a fake female Tinder profile of a girl named Lisa used an automatic tool to right-swipe 1,000 profiles of men in San Francisco and another 1,000 in New York City. Right-swiping means that you would like to be matched with that person. If that person also swipes right on your profile then you’re a match and can message them. In this experiement, a thousand matched and then messaged Lisa. Since this was a robot and not actually her, none of the men received any responses. Ms Cheng says this high number isn’t unusual on Tinder. ‘Her match rate was actually 70 per cent,’ she told DailyMail.com. Ms Cheng created up a fake female Tinder profile of a girl named Lisa and created a robot that right-swiped on 1,000 profiles of men in San Francisco and another 1,000 in New York City.  More than thousand matched and then messaged Lisa, but not turned hostile despite not receiving a response . The experiment was a response to Instagram account, ByeFelipe, allows women to share screenshots of abusive messages they receive on dating sites, such as Tinder . Ms Cheng said she thought some men may become hostile after being ignored, as shown in these screenshots from ByeFelipe's Instagram account. However, this was not the case . ‘There are a lot more men than women on Tinder, and often times a large fraction of the men in a women's swipe queue have already right-swiped on her, so they're ""pre-swiped"" in a sense and will insta-match.’ Here's a unique way to find your next date. Canadian engineer James Befurt was tired of wasting time on Tinder, so he decided to take matters into his own hands. Using a computer programme, along with a clever motor setup and a stylus, the Vancouver, British Columbia-based Java developer came up with a way to get through as many of his potential soulmates as quickly as possible. Apple recently revealed that Tinder was one of the most downloaded apps of the year. And - until now - it required users' undivided attention while perusing profiles. But Mr Befurt's hilarious contraption, shown in the video below, allows Tinder fans to swipe right forever - or at least until they run out of potential matches near them. Ms Cheng said she thought some men may become hostile after being ignored, as shown in sites such as ByeFelipe. But out of 1,007 men who messaged Lisa, none turned aggressive or rude. ‘Just about everyone who messaged her was friendly and respectful,’ said Ms Cheng. ‘Sure, there was teasing, guys who were straightforward about their intention to hook up, and plenty of bad pickup lines.’ ‘But no one became hostile or resorted to name-calling.’ Some of the matches took the time to ask her meaningful questions.

"These grisly photographs show how a hospital worker found a live maggot crawling on her Nutri-Grain bar she was about to eat for breakfast. Lisa Seymour, of Cambridge, said she was shocked to find the creature ‘wriggling on top’ of the Kellogg’s cereal bar after opening it at the weekend - seconds before she would have eaten it. The 29-year-old - who was offered just £4 compensation from the company when she complained on Monday - said the experience has put her off Nutri-Grain bars for life. Scroll down for video . Maggott in my cereal bar: Lisa Seymour said she found the creature wriggling around the Nutri-Grain bar . Wriggling: The incident reported by Miss Seymour (left) was at least the second of its kind in two months . Creature: The hospital worker said she was offered £4 compensation from the firm when she complained . Miss Seymour told MailOnline today: ‘It came in an Asda delivery and it was in a multipack, so I'd already eaten two in the packet. Then I went to eat at the weekend for breakfast. ‘You don't really look at it before you eat it - but when I was about to take a bite, I saw the maggot wriggling on top. I felt sick that I’d nearly eaten it, but also that I could have eaten one in the others.’ She added that she immediately contacted Kellogg’s customer services, who were ‘apologetic’ but insisted that the maggot would not have got into the bar during the production process. Miss Seymour was then offered £4 in Kellogg’s vouchers, but added: ‘I don't want to take the vouchers as I don't want to eat Kellogg’s products at the moment. ‘I didn’t feel like my complaint was taken seriously - I’d found maggots in my bar, it wasn't like it was mouldy. I would never eat a Nutri-Grain bar again, and I would be wary of Kellogg’s products.’ It comes two months after project coordinator Nick Todd, 22, from London, said he was 'nearly sick' after finding a live maggot in a Nutri-Grain bar - claiming it put him off Kellogg's products for life. Probe: Kellogg’s said it is asking the customer to return the bar to it so an investigation can be carried out . Looking into it: The company insisted it was taking the complaint about the Nutri-Grain bar 'very seriously' In the box: High temperatures used in the making of the bars mean a maggot could not survive, the firm said . After that incident, Kellogg's pledged to carry out a ‘full and thorough investigation’ into how the maggot was able to get into the food, adding that it took the complaint ‘very seriously’. A spokesman for the firm said at the time that it was 'extremely unlikely' the maggot entered the cereal bar in the factory 'because of the high temperatures involved in the production process'. And a Kellogg's spokesman told MailOnline: ‘Kellogg’s is taking this complaint very seriously. We are asking the consumer to return the bar to us so that a full investigation can be carried out. ‘However, in the last consumer complaint of this nature we dealt with in November, the investigation showed that the high temperatures used in the manufacture of Nutri-Grain bars meant such a specimen could not possibly have survived the production process. ‘Any infestation would have occurred after the bar was produced. Our pest control contractor did not find any issue relating to pest activity, nor were there any other complaints of this type during the production period.’ Miss Seymour,  originally from Diss in Norfolk, is a medical laboratory assistant in the microbiology department at Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge. An Asda spokesman declined to comment.","Lisa Seymour found creature wriggling around Kellogg's cereal bar .

"Mark Doughty, 39, was fired  after explaining to customers that a staff shortage and broken boiler meant they would not receive their usual service . A train worker was allegedly sacked for telling passengers why they were being served sub-standard food on board and now his colleagues are threatening strike action. Catering crew leader Mark Doughty, 39, was fired by East Coast trains after explaining to first-class customers on the Edinburgh to London train that a staff shortage and broken boiler meant they would not receive their usual cooked breakfast. Angry customers, who said they were not getting what they paid for, allegedly took it out on the staff, reducing some to tears. But afterwards, East Coast management allegedly accused Mr Doughty, an employee for nearly 14 years, of bringing the company into disrepute. And now members of the RMT Union are being balloted for industrial action demanding his reinstatement. Mr Doughty, from Edinburgh, said it was known in advance that the 5.48am service on September 29 from Waverley to King's Cross would be one member of staff short. But then the chef phoned in sick, reducing the catering crew to just four. The crew then found out via e-mail that the train had a broken boiler, meaning the crew could not serve cooked breakfasts, due to a lack of hot water. Instead, they handed out warmed-up paninis with bacon or scrambled egg and roast tomatoes - much to the customers' annoyance. Mr Doughty said: 'The passengers were not happy. The passenger who complained said the bacon panini was disgraceful - to put it politely. It tasted and looked disgusting. 'They were annoyed because they were not getting what they were paying for. Some took it out on the staff. One member of staff was in tears as a result. 'I explained it would not have made any difference if the chef had turned up because the broken boiler meant we could not serve them the food they would normally get.' RMT is now claiming that East Coast have used Mr Doughty as 'a scapegoat for continuous equipment failures on board trains'. They said he had been blamed for the 'inferior catering offer and bad management decisions' which allowed trains to be sent out, despite being short-staffed. He told passengers that the full cooked breakfast they would normally get on the early-morning Edinburgh-London train would not be available, for which he was accused of bring the company into disrepute . It said: 'Mark has been dismissed for bringing East Coast trains into disrepute yet there is not one shred of evidence that backs up the company's claim. 'If the charge is true and indeed that serious then why was Mark allowed to work his normal duties throughout September, October, November, and December?' A lack of hot water for washing meant the crew could not serve cooked breakfasts (file picture) In a message to its members, the union said: 'The RMT have entered into dispute over the sacking of Mark. 'You will be getting a ballot paper through your door soon please vote ""yes"" for strike action and action short of strike.' The passenger who first complained about the poor service was horrified to learn of the sacking. David Beaumont, a regular East Coast passenger said: 'I find it hard to believe a member of staff can simply be dismissed for telling the truth to insistent passengers like myself in such circumstances. 'The target of my complaint was the people responsible for the chaos, not the guy placed in the awkward position of breaking it to a train load of annoyed passengers, a job that he did incredibly well. 'I am a regular user and recently there has been constant problems with the provision of proper First Class food on this route.' An East Coast spokesman said: 'This is an internal matter, and there is nothing further for us to add at this time.'","Catering crew head Mark Doughty worked at East Coast trains for 14 years .

"Samsung's smart TVs made the headlines earlier this week when its privacy policy suggested the sets are capable of listening to private conversations. It caused such a furore that the South Korean tech giant has since issued a blog post clarifying its policy and vehemently denying the claims. But now it faces further problems after users began complaining the TVs have started randomly showing adverts during the middle of movies. Samsung smart TV users have complained their sets have started showing a Pepsi advert while watching movies on the Foxtel, and Plex apps. The advert covers half the screen and disrupts the film. Samsung told MailOnline it is making an investigation into the fault its 'top priority' Concerns about the adverts appeared on Monday by users of the Australian TV app Foxtel, available on Samsung smart TVs, reports Gigaom. One user wrote: 'After about 15 minutes of watching live TV, the screen goes blank and then a Pepsi advert - taking up about half the screen - pops up and stops Foxtel playing. 'It's as if there is a popup ad on the TV. I have not installed any other software or apps.' The same issue was also reported by at least five other people on a separate thread. It was initially thought to be a problem with the Foxtel app, but another forum member said he didn't have Foxtel installed on his Samsung TV but was experiencing the same issue. Furthermore, a Redditor said they had also been shown a Pepsi advert while watching films on the Plex app on their Samsung smart TV. Earlier this week, Samsung was criticised over claims its smart TVs can capture 'personal or other sensitive' conversations (policy extract pictured) User NexVentor wrote on Monday that they had been using Plex for two months and the advert had never appeared before. 'Every movie I play, 20 to 30 minutes in, it plays the Pepsi ad. It has happened on six movies today.' On the Foxtel thread, a company employee responded: 'This absolutely should not be happening and has been escalated immediately.' Samsung told MailOnline: 'We are aware of a situation that has caused some smart TV users in Australia to experience program interruption in the form of an advertisement. 'This seems to be caused by an error, and we are currently conducting a full and thorough investigation into the cause as our top priority. 'We would like to apologise for any inconvenience experienced by our customers.' Earlier this week, The Daily Beast highlighted a line in Samsung's smart TV privacy policy that suggested its voice recognition technology has the potential to listen to conversations and capture 'personal or other sensitive information'. Following the news, Electronic Frontier Foundation activist Parker Higgins tweeted that the Samsung terminology is similar to an excerpt from George Orwell's dystopian novel 1984. The wording of the policy concerned privacy campaigners and Electronic Frontier Foundation activist Parker Higgins tweeted Samsung's terminology was similar to an excerpt from George Orwell's 1984 (shown) At the time of the initial claims, a Samsung spokesman told MailOnline it takes consumer privacy very seriously and that 'any data gathering or their use is carried out with utmost transparency. The firm has since posted a blog post further clarifying that its smart TVs 'do not monitor living room conversations' At the time of the initial claims, a Samsung spokesman told MailOnline it takes consumer privacy very seriously and that 'any data gathering or their use is carried out with utmost transparency'. The firm has since posted a blog post further clarifying where it stands on the issue. 'Samsung smart TVs do not monitor living room conversations,' said the firm. Voice recognition lets the user control the TV using voice commands. It has to be activated in the first instance, and can be deactivated at any time. Samsung 'listens' for voice commands and then sends them, along with information about the device,  to a company called Nuance Communications. This service converts speech to text and the TV uses this text to search for content or carry out a task, for example. In addition, Samsung said it may collect and capture voice commands and associated texts for future use, so it can improve the features. Once enabled, Samsung told MailOnline that the voice data only consists of TV commands, or search sentences, only. Users can recognise if the voice recognition feature is activated because a microphone icon appears on the screen. A spokesman continued that Samsung doesn't sell voice data to third parties and the voice data is sent to a server, which searches for the requested content then sends it to the TV. He did not explain what happens to the captured data once it is no longer needed, and MailOnline has contacted Samsung for further information. It continued that language used in the policy -particularly the line: 'Please be aware that if your spoken words include personal or other sensitive information, that information will be among the data captured and transmitted to a third party through your use of Voice Recognition - has led to confusion. To clarify its position, Samsung explained: 'If you enable Voice Recognition, you can interact with your Smart TV using your voice. 'To provide you the Voice Recognition feature, some voice commands may be transmitted to a third-party service provider (currently, Nuance Communications, Inc.) that converts your interactive voice commands to text. 'In addition, Samsung may collect and your device may capture voice commands and associated texts so that we can provide you with Voice Recognition features and evaluate and improve the features.' And the firm stressed that it only collects voice commands when users make a specific search request to the smart TV by clicking the activation button either on the remote control or on their screen and speaking into the microphone on the remote control. If people don't enable the feature, they can't use the interactive features, but users can disable recognition data at any time in the Settings menu. Samsung has still not explained what it does with the data it collects, and how long it keeps it for. Plus, at the time of writing, it hasn't updated the wording of the privacy policy to make this clearer. Yesterday, Microsoft's Xbox console was among other devices accused of snooping on users. Kinect-controlled Xboxes listen to everything around them, silently waiting for commands such as ‘Xbox on’ or instructions to play games including Tomb Raider or Halo. The technology means people can play games or watch catch-up TV without using the remote control. Samsung stressed that it only collects voice commands when users make a specific search request to the smart TV by clicking the activation button either on the remote control, or on their screen and speaking into the microphone on the remote control.

Kinect-controlled Xboxes listen to everything around them, silently waiting for commands such as ‘Xbox on’. The technology means people can play games or watch catch-up TV without using the remote control . The news follows years of concerns about how much data smart TV sets and voice recognition technology capture and send. In 2012, Malta-based security firm ReVuln posted a video showing how its researchers had learned to crack a Samsung television to access its settings - including any personal information stored on it. With such malware installed, hackers could use the  TV's built-in microphones and camera to hear and see everything in front of it. Last summer, a Which? investigation then discovered just how much data the manufacturers can gather. Experts monitored streams of data coming from 2013 and 2014 models of smart TVs made by LG, Samsung, Sony, Panasonic and Toshiba. All the brands tracked people’s viewing habits to some extent, and users had agreed to this when they accepted the TVs terms and conditions. Most of data collected was encrypted to hide it from hackers, but a Samsung TV disclosed the tester’s location and postcode. The firm told Which? that location is needed to operate the TV, but that a postcode isn’t required.","Samsung smart TV owners said the sets have started randomly playing ads .

"Navy Secretary Ray Mabus sent the letters to the admirals which are considered to be career-ending reprimands leaving all three seeking retirement . Three more Navy admirals have been reprimanded in connection with the Fat Leonard bribery scandal after they accepted expensive gifts in exchange for Navy secrets but none will face criminal charges, the Navy said. The widening 'Fat Leonard' scandal  has seen senior sailors implicated in a long-running bribery scheme that included rewards of prostitutes, Lady Gaga tickets and payoffs in Southeast Asia. So far, the massive bribery scandal has cost the government $20 million and the admirals censured represent the highest-ranking officers to be punished in the case so far. Navy Secretary Ray Mabus sent censure letters to Michael Miller, Terry Kraft and David Pimpo, and they are considered to be career-ending reprimands leaving all three seeking retirement. The reprimands could even affect their ability to claim benefits after they displayed  such 'poor judgment and a failure of leadership in prior tours,' Mabus said. According to Navy officials, the entire case stems from an ongoing federal probe into bribery and fraud involving Navy contracts for port services in southeast Asia. Leonard Glenn Francis, a Malaysian contractor known as 'Fat Leonard' because of his size, pleaded guilty in federal court in San Diego to buying off U.S. military officials. The  contractor at the center of the scandal pleaded guilty to fraud charges last month, admitting to bribing officials with cash, Lady Gaga tickets, prostitutes, Cuban cigars and Kobe beef. Reprimands: Rear Admiral Terry Kraft, left, is commander of US naval forces in Japan and Rear Admiral David Pimpo, right is commander of Naval Supply Systems Command they both face censures . Censure: Rear Admiral Michael Miller is currently a special assistant to the superintendent of the US Naval Academy and faces censure . He confirmed that he presided over a decade-long scheme involving tens of millions of dollars in bribes, prosecutors said. Prosecutors said Francis, CEO of Singapore-based Glenn Defense Marine Asia, obtained classified information that allowed the firm to overbill the military at least $20 million. He charged them for port services such as food, fuel and garbage disposal. All of the admirals improperly accepted gifts, two 'improperly endorsed a commercial business,' and one solicited gifts and services when they were stationed in the Pacific region in 2006-2007. And all of the officers reprimanded were in high-ranking positions. Rear Admiral Michael Miller is currently a special assistant to the superintendent of the US Naval Academy. Rear Admiral Terry Kraft is commander of US naval forces in Japan. And Rear Admiral David Pimpo is commander of Naval Supply Systems Command. Conduct: Each admiral was punished for their conduct while assigned to the aircraft carrier USS Ronald Reagan, seen here, . Each were punished for their conduct while assigned to the aircraft carrier USS Ronald Reagan in a corruption scandal that has shaken the American navy. The corruption scandal has shaken the American navy, with several officers pleading guilty and another arrested this month in the case . Several Navy officers and officials, including a captain and a retired lieutenant commander have also have pleaded guilty to federal charges, while others await trial. Francis has acknowledged bribing officials with more than $500,000 in cash and luxury goods worth millions. The goods included spa treatments, top-shelf alcohol, designer handbags, furniture, watches, ornamental swords and handmade ship models, according to court documents. In exchange, Navy officers re-routed ships to ports owned by Francis and helped him boost his business. He now awaits sentencing. Meanwhile, another former high-ranking civilian contracting officer for the Navy was arrested last week on a conspiracy charge. He faces allegations that he accepted hundreds of thousands of dollars along with travel and the services of prostitutes for getting Navy contracts for GDMA. The Navy has canceled all contracts with the company.","The US Navy has censured three admirals for their roles in bribery scandal .

"An experimental spaceplane has returned to Earth after a successful mission. Esa launched its unmanned Intermediate Experimental Vehicle (IXV) on a Vega rocket from Kourou in South America at 1340 GMT today. The initial launch was postponed after an unidentified problem with the launch complex. In total the flight lasted about 100 minutes, and included a daring re-entry into Earth's atmosphere to test new technologies. The craft was fired 256 miles (412km) into Earth's atmosphere in the first test flight of technology that could lead to new re-usable spacecraft for use on future missions to Mars. Scroll down for a replay of the launch . The launch of an experimental spaceplane took place, after a minor delay due to an unidentified problem with the launch complex. Esa launched its unmanned Intermediate Experimental Vehicle (IXV) on a Vega rocket from South America at 1340 GMT today (still image from live video stream shown) 'IXV has opened a new chapter for Esa in terms of reentry capabilities and reusability,' explained Jean-Jacques Dordain, Esa Director General. 'Esa and its Member States, together with European space industry, are now ready to take up new challenges in several fields of space transportation, in future launchers, robotic exploration or human spaceflight.' IXV will be launched into a suborbital path by a Vega rocket launched from Europe’s Spaceport in French Guiana in February 11. IXV will separate from Vega at an altitude of 210 miles (340 km). IXV will coast to up to 256 miles (412km) and then begin its re-entry phase, recording a vast amount of data from a large number of conventional and advanced sensors. The entry speed of 4.6 miles per second (7.5 km/s) at an altitude of 75 miles (120 km) will create the same conditions as those for a vehicle returning from low orbit. IXV will glide through the atmosphere at hypersonic speeds to test new re-entry technologies before parachutes deploy to slow the descent for a splashdown in the Pacific. The 16ft (five metres) long spaceplane separated from the Vega rocket at an altitude of 210 miles (340km) above the Earth before climbing to its maximum altitude. It then flew East for around 20,000 miles (32,000km) during the 100-minute long test flight before re-entering the atmosphere at a rapid 16,800mph (27,000 km/h). During this time it navigated through the atmosphere using 'flaps' at its back, controlling its re-entry in a way not possible for capsules that return from space. After passing this test, it then splashed down in the Pacific Ocean as planned around 1525 GMT. 'This mission will teach us a lot about the technologies we need to apply in new launch systems, in particular when we think about reusable systems,' said Gaele Winters, Esa Director of Launchers. 'This was a short mission with big impact,' added Giorgio Tumino, IXV project manager. 'The cutting-edge technology we validated today, and the data gathered from the sensors aboard IXV, will open numerous opportunities for Europe to develop ambitious plans in space transportation for a multitude of applications.' This photo shows the Vega rocket lifting off from Esa's base in Kourou, French Guiana bearing the Intermediate Experimental Vehicle (IXV) on a 100-minute test mission . The 16ft (five metres) long spaceplane separated from the Vega rocket (shown just after launch) at an altitude of 210 miles (340km) above Earth before climbing to its maximum altitude . The IXV flew East for around 20,000 miles (32,000km) during the 100-minute long test flight before re-entering the atmosphere. Above is a map showing its 100-minute mission . Engineers at Esa hope to use the craft, which looks like a shrunken space shuttle without wings, to develop new ways of returning cargo and astronauts safely to Earth. It could also help scientists develop spacecraft that can land safely on the surface of Mars in future missions and then return samples to Earth. 'Re-entry is something we need to achieve if one day we want to have the ambition of having astronauts flying back to Earth with European technologies,' said Mr Tumino. IXV passed through the atmosphere at hypersonic speeds to test new European re-entry technologies before parachutes deployed to slow the descent for a safe splashdown in the Pacific Ocean. The Nos Aries recovery vessel will be used to retrieve the spacecraft. Over the last month, the crew have been testing the equipment for hoisting IXV out of the water. The two-piece shell of Vega opened to release the space plane at an altitude of about 200 miles (320 km). Pictured is an artist's impression of various stage of the test flight . Developed over five years at a cost of 150 million euros (£110 million or $225 million), the IXV is the testbed for a reusable vehicle that may one day be able to land on a conventional runway on Earth after a mission to space. This could be useful for bringing astronauts back from the International Space Station (ISS). The only craft currently able to ferry astronauts to the ISS and back is Russia's Soyuz. Speaking to the BBC, Mr Tumino said: 'Europe is excellent at going to orbit; we have all the launchers, for example. 'We also have great knowhow in operating complex systems in orbit. But where we are a bit behind is in the knowledge of how to come back from orbit. 'So, if we are to close the circle - go to orbit, stay in orbit, come back from orbit - this third leg we need to master as well as other spacefaring nations.' Engineers at Esa hope to use the craft (illustration shown), which looks like a shrunken space shuttle without wings, to develop new ways of returning cargo and astronauts safely to Earth. It could also help scientists develop spacecraft that can land safely on the surface of Mars in future missions and return samples to Earth . Scientists filled the IXV with sensors to monitor how the various materials and flight systems cope during the flight. After separating from the spacerocket, the IXV was travelling at hypersonic speeds of 9,562mph (15,389km/h). It  climbed further through the atmosphere before lowering and dipping its nose to begin re-entry. During the descent, the heat shields designed to protect the spaceplne reached temperatures of up to 1,700 degrees C (3,100 degree F) Flaps and thrusters helped control the vehicle as it descended, ensuring it came down at a pre-arranged landing site in the Pacific Ocean. Just before landing a parachute system deployed to allow the two-tonne vehicle to land gently, with airbags deploying to keep it from sinking. A recovery ship was waiting nearby - around 1,800 miles (2,900km) west of the coast of the Galapagos Islands. As it made its way through the atmosphere (illustration shown), IXV used 'flaps' at its back to control its re-entry in a way not possible for capsules that return from space, such as Nasa's recent Orion spacecraft. After passing this test, it then splashed down in the Pacific Ocean at the end of the flight . Last year Esa used a prototype of the IXV to practice recovering it from the ocean. An attempt to launch the IXV last November was postponed by engineers to allow additional analysis of the rockets trajectory to be conducted. Last year saw two major setbacks for the space industry. On October 28, an Orbital Sciences Antares rocket exploded shortly after launch on what was to be a supply mission to the ISS. This was followed three days later by the crash of Virgin Galactic tourist space plane SpaceShipTwo on a test flight, killing one of two pilots. Last year Esa used a prototype of the IXV to practice recovering it from the ocean, shown in this image .

"A disgusted couple say their romantic evening was ruined after discovering a giant cockroach during their meal. Stu Beevers made the sickening discovery while dining out with girlfriend Natalie Roberts, 27, in Manchester's Curry Mile. The 28-year-old said he had been enjoying his chicken kerala at Mughli Restaurant when he noticed the insect which was the size of a two pound coin. The pair were so disgusted by the grim discovery they left the restaurant without paying in protest. Disgusting: A cockroach was discovered by a couple who had gone for a romantic evening out at a restaurant in Manchester's Curry Mile . The couple, both from Stockport, are now set to report the incident to Manchester Council and say the unwanted ingredient left Stu vomiting all night following the meal on Saturday. Mughli closed immediately after being notified of the cockroach last Saturday for an internal investigation although the restaurant was open for business again last week. Natalie, from Heaton Moor, said: 'It was massive. As soon as we saw it we both just felt sick and wanted to get out of there. 'We pointed it out to the waiter and were asking for an apology but we got nothing. 'It seemed all they were interested in was getting the plate off us and getting rid of the evidence, I made sure I kept hold of it and took a picture. 'It's disgusting. We went because it's meant to be one of the more upmarket restaurants on Curry Mile but this just isn't on - we want to warn people and make sure it doesn't happen to anyone else.' Stu Beevers (pictured) said he was physically ill after making the gross discovery while dining at Mughli Restaurant . After the insect, which was the size of a two pound coin, was found, the restaurant closed and are now carrying out a full investigation . Mughli, which also has a restaurant in Knutsford, Cheshire, was given a four-star 'very good' rating in its last inspection by Manchester council food hygiene officers in October 2012. A spokesman for the restaurant said: 'Immediately that the allegation was received, an apology was made and the restaurant closed with no more food being served to allow us to make a full investigation.

"A kind-hearted stranger handed a £10 gift voucher to a five-year-old girl for having good manners. Property developer Anthony Roberts, 62, was taking his granddaughter Ruby Roberts to look at the toys at an Argos store on their way home from her school in Newquay, Cornwall. The mystery woman approached the couple and remarked on the polite, pleasant and well-behaved nature of Ruby, before presenting the youngster with the gift voucher. Given a gift voucher: A mystery woman approached Anthony Roberts (left), 62, and his five-year-old granddaughter Ruby Roberts (right), before remarked on the girl’s polite, pleasant and well-behaved nature . Mystery: Ruby (left) was able to buy the toy doll she had wanted from Argos (right), by combining the £10 voucher with the money she had saved taking out the rubbish at a family friend’s holiday home . Mr Roberts is now trying to track down the generous gift-giver - who approached while Ruby was spelling out the names of the toys on her wishlist, but left before she could be thanked. Ruby was able to buy the toy doll she had wanted, by combining the £10 voucher with money she had saved taking out the rubbish at a family friend’s holiday home. Mr Roberts said that he occasionally picks up Ruby from school, and they sometimes go into Argos to look at what toys she would like from the catalogue - before she has to spell them out. He added: ‘A lady who had been watching Ruby came up and gave her a gift voucher after remarking how polite, pleasant and well behaved she was. ‘Ruby did not know what it was at first until I explained that’s what you get for being a nice person. I did not get the lady’s name and she was gone before we could thank her properly.

I think it was a genuinely moving thing to do because people do not do these sorts of things now.' The grandfather said that he later posted what had happened on Facebook and it had a 'tremendous response'.

"They are the not-so secret escapes of amorous couples in Latin America and across Asia. Yet to some, they represent a sordid side of the hotel industry. Love hotels, couples' hotels or 'motels' as they are known in Brazil charge by the hour, allowing guests the chance to 'relax' without the need for awkward glances over breakfast. The phenomenon began in Japan, where there are now up to 30,000 love hotels offering at the lower end, a £10 per hour  bed and en suite bathroom,  to a bed with silk sheets, flat screen TV, adult entertainment and a bath big enough for two.

"There isn't a single mention of anyone singing Jerusalem, and it certainly wasn't jam they were making on the kitchen worktop. So a raunchy tale of two sex-starved sweethearts has aroused the passions of the Women's Institute – after it was published by members. The 50 Shades Of Grey-style short story appears in a charity book put together by a WI writing group. Yesterday they defended their decision to include the X-rated work in a compilation of poetry and fiction, although one member conceded: 'It's not for the faint hearted.' But some of the good folk of Wellington – the otherwise perfectly respectable Somerset town where the book is on sale – disagree. 'Really, one does not expect such smut from a group of women involved in the WI,' said Enid Ray. She added: 'I was wholly shocked.' Scroll down for video . A WI writing club from Wellington, Somerset have published a book of short stories to raise money for charity. The last tale in the compilation is a steamy three-page piece of erotic fiction (Pictured, left to right from back: Bridget Hodges, Lynda Williamson, Janice Melmoth, Chrissy Barnett, Erica Bond, Chris Tron, Heidi Gains, Sue Bowler and Judith Smith who form part of the Wellington WI writing club) The door creaked and in Clive walked. He looked amazing to behold with his mound of auburn curls and his newly grown designer stubble. He gave her a cheeky wink and a teasing tap to her rump. Mariah turned and gave him a massive full bodied hug. Her man was home. She kissed him temptingly and gave him her most longing and yet innocent of looks. 'I can tell you missed me Mariah. Been quite a while... and I am a man in desperate, aching need...' Clive knew she was teasing him. He put his arms around her waist from behind and gently gyrated his massive schlong against her lovely wide buttocks . 'Come on... drop your drawers, Princess! This man is lusty!' Clive was masterful in his demand. The tempo of their passion escalated. He couldn't wait for his 'oats' any longer. HIs girl was certainly a naughty one! 'Do you think it's worked this time?' Mariah quizzed pleadingly. He had in his lust forgotten all about their efforts to conceive. 'Who knows, Princess? You never know! Now be a good woman and make us a cuppa. That exertion has totally knackered me out!' Clive then gave her buttocks a loving, playful tap and went and turned the TV on. They would forever remember this moment in time. It would later prove to be a life-changing segment in their story. Time showed that this Adonis with his Goddess had finally conquered the game that is conception . Stacy Faulkner, 50, who sells the book from her shop, Nurtured by Nature, in the town, said a local WI woman came in and told her: 'I don't know if you want to sell this because the last chapter is a bit raunchy'. She added: 'I've been reading the book – I read the last chapter first! I can see why some of the older ladies are kicking up a fuss. But it's just a bit of fun.' The story, The Conquering Gibraltarian Adonis features a couple called Mariah and Clive, reunited when he returns from a long spell at sea with tumbling auburn curls and newly-grown designer stubble. The pair are married, it transpires, and – praise the Lord – intent on starting a family. At least that fits in with a WI ethos that has held firm since the organisation's inception in 1915. Yet Clive has barely crossed the threshold before it's straight down to business. To be fair, the story is just three pages long so there's precious little space to waste on plot development. But what follows might make even 50 Shades author EL James blush. Much of it is unsuitable for repetition. Suffice to say that heaving thighs and 'magnificent cleavage' feature among the less controversial prose. Things hot up as soon as Clive announces: 'I am a man in desperate, aching need.' The story continues: 'She was trying to play hard to get. That was becoming difficult as she really wanted it right now on top of the kitchen counter.' It continues: 'Mariah giggled in that mischievous way he loved, whilst playfully taunting him with those eyes. 'She feigned interest and bent over the worktop to reach the tin of tea bags. Clive put his hands around her waist from behind…' Heavens to Betsy! In a WI book? Surely not? The short story, written by a WI member for a charity book they have released, is called The Conquering Gibraltarian Adonis . But yes, yes… yes! Clive – 'masterful in his demand' – skips the romance by commanding: 'Drop your drawers, Princess – this man is lusty!' Their lovemaking causes 'sudden waves of pleasure' to pulse through Mariah's entire body. But then it's back to normal. 'Make us a cuppa,' says Clive, and moves away to turn on the TV. The story comes with an 18-plus rating for readers and warns: 'Read no further if you are of a delicate disposition or think you may be offended by the contents of what follows.' Some are clearly not, however. The book, with an innocuous cover featuring butterflies and flowers in the artwork, was disappearing from local shops yesterday and 150 have already been sold. The compilation authors are members of the Monumental Women's Writing Group, which takes its name from the town's monument. Members of the WI writing club from Wellington, Somerset . The 75-page book called Once Upon A Time Wellington WI is being sold for £4 . Their Facebook page at www.facebook.com/monumentalwomensink contains details of the work below a photograph of some of the Wellington team. The £4 book, Monumental Women's Ink: Once Upon A Time Wellington WI, is being sold to raise money for nearby Musgrove Park Hospital's Beacon centre for cancer treatment. Group leader Bridget Hodges, a 63-year-old retired writer, said: 'When 50 Shades came out, we talked about it quite a bit. We decided that we would have a go and try to write some ourselves. 'In the end, only one of our members managed to produce a piece.' When the book was compiled, the story was included. Unlike EL James, however, the author remains anonymous. 'She doesn't want anyone to know it was her,' Mrs Hodges explained. 'She said her gran would be furious.' To buy a copy of the book or to donate to the cause visit the group's Facebook page .

"Bobbi Kristina's aunt has said she believes Nick Gordon will '110 per cent' be charged with a crime related to the 21-year-old's injuries. Leolah Brown, Bobby Brown's sister, said she thinks he had a part in the incident on January 31, when Bobbi Kristina was found face-down in a bathtub at the couple's Roswell, Georgia townhouse. No one has been charged in the incident or named as a suspect, and Gordon has not responded to the family's accusations. Bobbi Kristina, the 21-year-old daughter of Whitney Houston, has been on a ventilator in hospital since she was found, but Leolah Brown insisted she is 'doing good' and has even opened her eyes. Scroll down for video . Speaking out: Speaking to Fox News, Leolah Brown, Bobbi Kristina's aunt, has said she believes the young woman's boyfriend, Nick Gordon, should be charged in relation to her injuries . 'I saw this coming,' she told Fox 5 Atlanta. 'I told her not to trust anyone.' Gordon was taken in by Houston as a child and brought up as Bobbi Kristina's brother - but after Houston's death, they started a romantic relationship and last year, they claimed they had married. In the Fox interview, Leolah said she does not think Gordon has been a good influence on her niece. 'I have my reasons,' she said, without going into further detail. 'There are a lot of family reasons that have that same reason.' She went on: 'I believe Nick Gordon will be charged with this... I hope that he will be charged with this as well. Soon. I really do.' She added that she had lived with Whitney Houston and Bobby Brown and had helped them look after Bobbi Kristina, but never saw Gordon around the house. 'Signs of improvement': She said that Bobbi Kristina, pictured with Gordon, has opened her eyes and appears to be improving. Gordon has not responded to the family's accusations about his part in the incident . Scene: Gordon and a friend discovered Bobbi Kristina in the bathtub at their home in the neighborhood of Roswell, Georgia, pictured, on January 31. She has been in a medically-induced coma ever since . She also reiterated her brother's statement that the young couple are not married, despite their claims on social media last year, and hinted that they had been through some trouble. 'This is the man Krissi loved but she was a young girl,' she said. 'We stay.' Leolah also dismissed the idea that Bobbi Kristina would have hurt herself. 'Krissi would never do anything to herself,' she said. 'She loved life too much. She had too much going on. She had too much ahead of her.' As for her niece's current condition, she rubbished reports that Bobbi Kristina was brain dead. 'It's been very, very painful for everybody. Mainly Bobby, because that's his baby,' she said of her brother, Bobby Brown. But she added that they remain hopeful, especially because she has given them 'signs' that she'll recover, such as opening her eyes, she said. There is also no truth to the idea that Bobbi Kristina would be removed from life support today - the same day her mother died three years ago - she said. Support: On Wednesday, Bobbi Kristina's grandmother Cissy Houston (right) and aunt Pat Houston (center) were seen at Emory University Hospital, where the 21-year-old woman remains in a coma . By her side: Bobbi Kristina's father Bobby Brown (left) can be seen outside the hospital last week, while his wife Alicia Etheredge, who is four months pregnant, was pictured outside the hospital on Wednesday . 'No,' she said, adding: 'Bobby's calling the shots.' The family has been at Bobbi Kristina's bedside in Emory University Hospital in Atlanta, where she remains in a medically-induced coma after being found submerged in bathwater. On the scene: Max Lomas, seen in an old mug shot, was the one who found Bobbi Kristina in the bath . No one has been charged or named as a suspect in the January incident. Gordon has not commented publicly about his girlfriend's condition and has not responded to the family's accusations. Earlier this week, RadarOnline reported that bruises were found on Bobbi Kristina's body. Gordon told a friend that he caused them while performing CPR. It has also emerged that one of their neighbors reported a domestic dispute at her address the week before she was found, according to a 911 call made by her security guard on January 23. The caller told a 911 dispatcher that one of the neighbors had reported a fight at the address. They said they saw people 'hitting each other and swinging' outside the three bedroom townhouse. He did not give descriptions of how many people were fighting or who they were . The ongoing investigation and limited details being provided in Miss Brown's case have fueled speculation about her condition and the circumstances that led to her hospitalization. 'We continue to request privacy in this matter,' Bobby Brown said in a statement released through his lawyer, Christopher Brown. 'We thank everyone that supported the vigil for Bobbi Kristina. God is hearing our prayers.' See below for video .","Bobby Brown's sister Leolah has said in an interview that she believes Bobbi Kristina's boyfriend Nick Gordon will be charged in the incident .

"Three white teenagers have been jailed after admitting they were out hunting black people when they used their truck to run over and kill a man. Deryl Paul Dedmon, now 22, was sentenced to 50 years in a federal prison after the death of 47-year-old James Craig Anderson in Jackson, Mississippi. John Aaron Rice was also sentenced to 18-and-a-half years in jail while Dylan Wade Butler must serve seven years after being convicted of commission of a hate crime. Scroll down for video . Derly Paul Dedmon, pictured, who has been sentenced to 50 years in a federal prison after pleading guilty to the capital murder of John Craig Anderson in Jackson, Mississippi in 2011 . Dedmon from Brandon, Mississippi, pleaded guilty to capital murder and hate crime after Mr Anderson, a car plant worker in Mississippi's capital, was killed in June 2011. He was at the wheel of a truck that ran over Mr Anderson in the parking lot of a Jackson hotel with the incident being was caught on a security camera at the hotel. The surveillance video shows the white Jeep Cherokee in which Rice was a passenger leaving a hotel parking lot. James Craig Anderson, a a car plant worker, who was killed after being run over in a hotel parking lot by a truck that Dedmon was driving . Less than 20 seconds later, a Ford truck backs up and then lunges forward and Mr Anderson's shirt is illuminated in the headlights before he disappears under the vehicle next to the curb. Appearing in court, all three, wearing red prison jumpsuits and shackled at the waist and ankles, took to a podium to apologize to members of Anderson's family for their actions. Dedmon said: 'I want to tell the Anderson family how truly sorry I am.' The apologies came after an impassioned condemnation of their actions from Mr Anderson's sister, Barbara. She said her brother's death came 'at the hands of these strangers with eyes full of hatred.' She added her brother 'helplessly fought to stay alive' as he was attacked by people he did not know. Prosecutors said the youths harassed or assaulted black people who they thought were homeless or intoxicated. Victims were chosen because they thought they would not tell police, authorities said with the harassment beginning in April 2011, culminating in the death of Mr Anderson. They pleaded guilty in March 2012 to one count of conspiracy and one count of committing a hate crime. Each was sentenced to five years on the conspiracy count to run concurrent with the other. In Dedmon's case, U.S. District Judge Carlton Reeves said the federal sentenced would run concurrent with his state sentence. The judge added: 'What these people did was ugly, painful and sad and criminal. Before sentencing, he also told the courtroom that the Mr Anderson's death reflected the 'inhumanity of racism' with which Mississippi has dealt throughout its history. He explained: '""The sad thing is these ... hunts were instigated by our children, these kids. 'The victims were targeted because of their race. These three defendants and others made a joint decision to act on racial hatred.' John Aaron Rice, left, who has been sentenced to 18-and-a-half years in prison and Dylan Wade Butler, right, who has been ordered to serve seven years in jail . Meanwhile seven other defendants in the case are still awaiting sentencing. They include Joseph Paul Dominick, William Kirk Montgomery and Jonathan Kyle Gaskamp. Dominick pleaded guilty to conspiracy in 2013 and faces five years in prison. Montgomery, who pleaded guilty in 2012, faces life in prison on a hate crime charge and five years on conspiracy, while Gaskamp, who wasn't present the night Anderson died, pleaded guilty in 2012 alsofaces five years in prison for conspiracy and 10 years on a hate crime charge.

"Arizona has become one of the first states to ditch Michelle Obama's healthy eating plan when it comes to school fundraisers, after snow cones didn't meet the set standards. The recently introduced Smart Snacks provision of the Healthy,Hunger-Free Kids Act, forbids sugary and fatty foods from being sold on campus. However, Arizona schools chief Diane Douglas has granted an exception for the patch she manages, calling the regulations 'ridiculous'. Her outrage stemmed from an incident where school children were told they could not sell snow cones because they were not on a list of snacks approved by the federal government. Arizona has become one of the first states to ditch Michelle Obama's healthy eating plan when it comes to school fundraisers, after snow cones didn't meet the set standards . Under the Obama-endorsed guidelines - enforced on July 1 2014 - any food sold in schools must be a 'whole grain-rich' grain product and have a fruit, vegetable, dairy product, or protein as the primary ingredient. Snack-size items must contain less than 200 calories and less that 230mg of salt. The federal rules don't apply to food that is intended to be consumed at home or outside of school - so kids can still sell fundraiser mainstays like frozen pizza, frozen cookie dough and chocolate bars. Commenting on the Smart Snack initiative, Douglas told the Arizona Daily Star: 'Forcing parents and other supporters of schools to only offer federally approved food and snacks at fundraisers is a perfect example of the overreach of government and intrusion into local control. 'I have ordered effective immediately that the ADE Health and Nutrition Services division grant exemptions for all fundraisers for both traditional public schools and charter public schools.' South Carolina schools have also partially lifted the ban on junk food after districts argued that it was hampering the ability of volunteer groups to raise money for activities like field trips. Despite the backlash, many schools say they have been successful in ditching the unhealthier models. In Dallas, physical education teacher Sharon Foster says her school, James Bowie Elementary, stopped selling chocolate bars and started selling Y-Ties - elastic shoe laces that don't have to be tied. Parent Susan Fox Pinkowitz said she helped her children's elementary school, University Park Elementary in Denver, move from a candy-filled annual carnival to a fun run and carnival that offers apples and protein nut bars. Cake's off the menu: The Smart Snacks provision of the Healthy,Hunger-Free Kids Act, which was introduced last July, forbids sugary and fatty foods from being sold on campus. Swapping snow cones for shoelaces: Despite the backlash, many schools say they have been successful in ditching the unhealthier models . She said the new fundraiser brings in as much as $12,000 annually, three or four times the amount raised by the old event. The federal rules allow states to seek exemptions for an 'infrequent' number of fundraisers, but fewer than half have asked for them, according to the National Association of State Boards of Education. Kristen Amundson, the association's director, says the group has been asking state boards to give careful thought to whether they need to seek exemptions. 'Do you really want a bake sale every day, 180 days a year?' Amundson said. 'Maybe, but probably not.' The idea is to prevent frequent junk-food fundraisers that fill kids up and divert them - and their dollars - from healthier foods in the cafeteria and elsewhere in school. Congress passed the fundraiser standards in 2010, and they are part of a larger government effort championed by first lady Michelle Obama to make all foods sold in schools healthier.","The Smart Snacks provision of the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act, bans sugary and fatty foods  from being sold on campus .

"During his 16 years at The Daily Show, Jon Stewart and his team of writers and corespondents have become famous for their attacks on politicians, celebrities and talking heads. Among those who have been mocked by the program are Bill O'Reilly, Sarah Palin, Glenn Beck and Tucker Carlson, to name just a very few. No one however was taken to task more than President George Bush, and nearly everyone in his cabinet, over his two terms as president. Scroll down for videos . Jon Stewart frequently mocked Bill O'Reilly (above) on The Daily Show . In fact, Stewart was mocking Bush and his cohorts on his program Monday while discussing the Brian Williams scandal following the NBC anchor's false story about being on a helicopter that took enemy fire while in Iraq in 2003. 'Finally, someone is being held to account for misleading America about the Iraq war. It might not necessarily be the first person you’d want held accountable on that list,' said Stewart. 'But never again will Brian Williams mislead this great nation about being shot at in a war we probably wouldn’t have ended up in if the media had applied this level of scrutiny to the actual f*cking war.' He then showed clips of Dick Cheney, Colin Powell and Condoleeza Rice and some of the statements they gave in interviews about the war, which many people now believe were false and misleading. As for Palin, Stewart said of the former vice presidential candidate last moth after a speech she gave in Iowa; 'Incoherent, rambling, unintelligible, folksy idioms — she’s not speaking at a political event, Sarah Palin is trying to is trying to sell America a Lincoln.' Stewart (with Ed Helms, Stephen Colbert, Rob Corddry and Samantha Bee) announced he would be leaving The Daily Show on Tuesday . His most famous feud came not on his own show however, but when he appeared on Crossfire in 2004, and after being called out for not being funny by Carlson, said to the host; 'Nah, I’m not going to be your monkey.; . He then called him a 'dick.' This as Stewart announced he will leave at the end of this year, most likely when his contract expires in the Fall. 'Seventeen years is the longest I have ever in my life held a job by sixteen years and five months. The upshot there being I am a terrible employee. In my heart I know it is time for someone else to have that opportunity,' said the host on the program Tuesday. 'I don't have any specific plans. I have a lot of ideas. I have a lot of things in my head. We're going to have dinner on a school night with my family who I have heard from multiple sources are lovely people,' he added. 'You know, I'm not going to be here and try to sum up what this place has meant to be mover the years. I couldn't' do that. We got plenty of time.' Getting emotional he then said; 'What is this fluid? What are these feelings? Frankenstein angry!' He closed by saying; 'It's been an absolute privilege. It's been the honor of my professional life, and I thank you for watching it. For hate watching it. Whatever reason you were tuning in for.' Comedy Central, who is losing Stewart just months after Stephen Colbert departed the network to take over for David Letterman on The Late Show, also expressed how sad they were to see the popular host leave. 'For the better part of the last two decades, I have had the incredible honor and privilege of working with Jon Stewart. His comedic brilliance is second to none,' Michele Ganeless, the network's president, said in a statement. 'Jon has been at the heart of Comedy Central, championing and nurturing the best talent in the industry, in front of and behind the camera. Through his unique voice and vision, ‘The Daily Show’ has become a cultural touchstone for millions of fans and an unparalleled platform for political comedy that will endure for years to come.' 'Jon will remain at the helm of The Daily Show’ until later this year,' she added. 'He is a comic genius, generous with his time and talent, and will always be a part of the Comedy Central family.'

"Non-single ladies, it may be prudent to drop your expectations in the run-up to this Valentine's Day, according to a new infographic. Hugs and Disses, which was compiled by Chicago-based branding agency Arc, asked men and women questions about the looming February 14 celebration and perhaps unsurprisingly, it yielded rather polarizing results. While nearly 40per cent of women quizzed said they wanted 'an evening out at a special event', only 20per cent of men plan on delivering this. Wishful thinking: The poll quizzed men and women about Valentine's Day and, perhaps unsurprisingly, it yielded rather polarizing results . And men aren't just avoiding a special night out. While 33per cent of women want 'a romantic evening at home', only 18per cent of men have this in mind. At least some of us are striking gold, since 30per cent of women admit they are 'at least somewhat envious' of how others are treated by their Valentine. On average, men cough up $137 in honor of the big day, while women spend around $86. This generosity is often forced out grudgingly. Thirty-seven per cent of men think Valentine's Day is 'a total racket', and are four times more likely to give a gift 'out of obligation' than women.

"Police officers and firefighters who helped save lives in the aftermath of the Boston Marathon bombing and the shooting at a Sikh temple in Wisconsin were honored with the Medal of Valor in a White House ceremony Wednesday. Vice President Joe Biden draped the purple and yellow striped ribbons around the necks of 20 public safety officers, and presented medals to the families of two officers killed while responding to armed robberies. The two were off-duty at the time. 'You're a rare breed,' Biden said. 'You're all crazy. We love you for it. We need you. You are the best thing we have going for us.' Scroll down for video . Deputy Jenna Underwood-Nunez of the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department, California, is awarded the Public Safety Officer Medal of Valor by US Vice President Joe Biden (R), as US Attorney General Eric Holder . Vice President Joe Biden and Attorney General Eric Holder, left, award the Medal of Valor to former Chief John Curley, from the Bellmore, New York Fire Department . Two people were dead on the ground outside the Sikh Temple in August 2012 when Lt. Brian Murphy and Officer Savan Lenda of the Oak Creek Police Department arrived on scene. The suspected gunman was fleeing. Murphy pulled his gun, but the suspect fired first, hitting Murphy in his throat, legs and hand. When Lenda arrived on the scene and shot the suspect, the shooter crawled out of view and killed himself. Lenda sent fellow officers to help Murphy, but the lieutenant waved them away and insisted they help those still inside the temple. The White House said the two officers' actions helped save the lives of many. Boston and the surrounding area were in a state of panic in April 2013 because the suspects in the marathon bombing remained at large. Vice President Joe Biden awards John Michael Capano, son of ATF special agent John Francis Capano, the Medal of Valor during today's ceremony . Vice President Joe Biden, accompanied by Attorney General Eric Holder, award the Medal of Valor to Officer Andrew Keith, from the Knoxville, Tenn., Police Department . The fateful night when Dzhokhar and Tamerlan Tsarnaev carjacked a vehicle before a dramatic confrontation with police is well known. Less well known were the contributions of seven officers and firefighters from Watertown, Massachusetts, who received the medal from Biden. Despite heavy weapon gunfire and reports the brothers were throwing explosives, officers and firefighters who responded helped protect the lives of those in uniform, the White House said. Tamerlan died as a result of the incident; Dzhokhar was apprehended 20 hours later. Attorney General Eric Holder said this year's medals were particularly poignant, given that the country is struggling with 'deep challenges' in the relationship between law enforcement agencies and their communities. 'Beyond these honors, America owes you a debt that must be repaid not just with words but with actions,' Holder said. The Medal of Valor is the nation's highest honor for public safety officers who risk their own safety to save or protect others. This year's ceremony honored individuals who committed acts of valor between 2011 and 2013. Vice President Joe Biden, flanked by Attorney General Eric Holder, left, and Rep.

A total of 95 medals have been handed out since Congress created the award in 2001. Also receiving the medal were: Five special agents from the FBI's Alabama-based hostage rescue team, who rescued a 5-year-old abducted from a school bus in 2013. Sgt. Daniel Hutchinson, Weber County, Utah, who was shot three times but still rescued two fellow sheriff's deputies in a shooting. Officer Michael Keith, Knoxville, Tennessee, who used his shirt to beat back flames from a car, then pulled a state trooper to safety just before the vehicle exploded. Former Fire Chief John Curly, Bellmore, New York, who broke a burning building's window with his bare hands to rescue an unconscious woman inside. Special Agent John Francis Capano, New York, who was killed while confronting a suspect during an attempted robbery attempt. Sgt.

"A member of the British 'doom core' heavy metal band Black Tongue has been seriously injured after falling from his speeding tour bus when he mistook the exit for a toilet door. Lead singer Alex Teyen, 23, suffered head and facial injuries and was rushed to hospital after opening the door of the tour bus while it was travelling along a Polish motorway en route to the German capital Berlin. Local police said the Hull-based rocker was 'probably under the influence of alcohol' at the time, adding that his wounds are not life-threatening and he is expected to make a full recovery. The incident has drawn comparisons with the fictional hard rock band  in the 1984 mockumentary 'This Is Spinal Tap', which lampooned rock'n'roll excesses and the antics of heavy metal musicians. Mistake: Lead singer Alex Teyen, 23, (centre) suffered head and facial injuries after opening the door of the tour bus while it was travelling along a Polish motorway en route to the German capital Berlin . The accident occured shortly after the band left Warsaw on the 400 mile journey to the German capital, where Black Tongue were scheduled to play a concert the following evening. It is understood that Teven told his bandmates that he was getting up to go to the toilet, only to find that the cubicle was already engaged. Seconds later he opened the exit door and stepped out while the bus was still speeding along the motorway. Teven's bandmates realised what happened a short time later and stopped the coach. They found their bandmate laying injured at the side of the and administered first aid, while a local who spoke 'broken English' called the emergency services, according to the Telegraph. Local police spokesman Officer Piotr Kaciak told the newspaper: 'Judging by the manner of the victim's behaviour, speech and smell we suspect he was under the influence of alcohol.' Family members in Hull said Teven's father had travelled to Poland to help his 'battered and bruised' son return to the UK. They added that the musician's condition was 'okay'. Spoof: The incident has drawn comparisons with the fictional hard rock band in the 1984 mockumentary 'This Is Spinal Tap', which lampooned rock'n'roll excesses and the antics of heavy metal musicians . Black Tongue's most successful release today is 2014's five-track, 25-minute long EP 'Born Hanged', which includes songs such as 'Purgatory', 'Coma', and 'Foreshadow'. The band's 'Ashes to Ashes European Tour 2015' was only five dates in at the time of Sunday's incident, with the band now having missed dates in Berlin and Hamburg. Black Tongue were scheduled to perform in the Dutch city of Numegen this evening and in Paris tomorrow on a Europe-wide tour that would have seen them perform every evening until the end of the month. The band have not yet released a statement on whether they plan to resume their tour once Teven has recovered.","Singer Alex Teven, 23, left with head and facial injuries following incident .

"A Saudi Arabian historian tried to justify his nation's ban on female drivers by saying that they might get raped if their cars break down. He added his opinion that in countries like America sexual crimes 'are no big deal' to women. In a recent interview on Saudi Rotana Khalijiyya TV, historian Saleh al-Saadoon said that if a Saudi Arabian's woman's car were to break down she could get raped. He then went on to say that in countries where women are allowed to drive that women 'don't care' if they are raped the way they do in Saudi Arabia, according to the transcript translated by the Middle East Media Research Institute. Scroll down for video . Controversial claim: 'They don't care if they are raped,' said Saudi Arabian historian Saleh al-Saadoon of American female drivers . Shock: The female host of the talk show on Saudi Rotana Khalijiyya TV was shocked by the historian's claim . 'They don't care if they are raped on the roadside, but we do,' al-Saadoon said. 'Hold on. Who told you they don’t care about getting raped on the roadside?' asked the horrified female host not named in the transcript. 'It’s no big deal for them beyond the damage to their morale,' al-Saadoon replied. 'In our case, however, the problem is of a social and religious nature,' he added. Two other guests on the show also appeared to be in absolute horror but al-saadoon just replied 'listen to me and get used to what society thinks.' Al-saadoon then said that women in his country who do not drive are treated like 'queens' and mentioned that with a gesture of their hand that their fathers, uncles, sons, and nephews must chauffeur them around . Foreign drivers: 'The solution is to bring in female foreign chauffeurs to drive our wives,' said the historian of the way to prevent rape of women by male chauffeurs . Humor: The female host had trouble taking the historian's comments in a serious light . Arrested: Loujain Hathloul was arrested after she tried to drive into the country from neighboring United Arab Emirates, flouting the ban on women motorists . The female host then asked al-saadoon if he thought there was no danger of women being raped by their male chauffeurs. He agreed that it was a legitimate threat and made a suggestion that elicited shock from the female host. 'There is a solution, but the government officials and the clerics refuse to hear of it,' he said. 'The solution is to bring in female foreign chauffeurs to drive our wives,' he added. 'Female foreign chauffeurs?' she said before covering her hand over her mouth. 'Seriously?' If women drive in Saudi Arabia they face punishment including being lashed with a whip. Two women's rights campaigners who tried to drive into Saudi Arabia are set to face a special 'terrorism' court. Loujain Hathloul, 25, was arrested after she tried to drive into the country from neighbouring United Arab Emirates, flouting the ban on women motorists. Maysaa Alamoudi, 33, a UAE-based Saudi journalist, arrived at the border to support Hathloul and was also detained. Activists claim that it is the first time female motorists have been referred to the criminal court in the capital of Riyadh, which was established to try terrorism cases.","Historian Saleh al-Saadoon said that in countries where women can drive they don't care if they're raped .

"Its smoke-blackened ceilings lit by builders' lamps, this is the charred Glasgow School of Art library nine months into a painstaking restoration. Opened in 1909, the Mackintosh Library's dark wood, high windows, ornate balcony and clusters of electric lamps helped it become known as a turning point in modern architecture and one of the finest buildings in Britain. But the much-loved centre of learning was gutted last year by a blaze sparked when canned spray foam, which a student was using for an art project, drifted into a projector fan and caught alight. Scroll down for video . Phoenix from the ashes: Nine months after a fire ravaged the world-renowned Mackintosh Library at Glasgow School of Art, builders have almost finished the painstaking task of making the building structurally sound before a restoration which could cost up to £35million . Hard work: Its walls still blackened by smoke and lit by builders' lamps, the century-old library has lost the dark wood for which it was known . Precious: The £50million building is Grade A listed, the Scottish equivalent of Grade I, and is being preserved for future use despite the fire . The Grade A-listed library, the equivalent of Grade I listed in England, was designed by the Glasgow-born architect Charles Rennie Mackintosh and was described by critics as his finest work. He also designed offices for the Scottish newspapers the Daily Record and Glasgow Herald alongside the Royal Highland Fusiliers Regimental Museum in the city. Its demise began at 12.27pm on May 23 last year in the basement, where undergraduate students were putting the finishing touches to their final year show. An unnamed student was using highly flammable canned spray foam to fill in the gaps in an artwork which involved three large sheets of foam, each up to three inches thick. The foam sheets formed three 'walls' framing a fourth blank wall, onto which a digital projector was beaming images when the spraying took place. As the fumes from the spray foam spread around the room, they were sucked into the cooling fan of the projector and caught alight as they wafted over the heat of the circuit board. How it looked: Opened in 1909, the Mackintosh Library's dark wood, high windows, ornate balcony and clusters of electric lamps helped it become known as a turning point in modern architecture and one of the finest buildings in Britain . Precious: The original library. The fire prompted anguish in the art and architecture community, which said it was Mackintosh's finest work . Ravaged: The blaze broke out on May 23 last year after a student preparing for a final-year degree exhibition used spray foam near a projector . Damage: The spray foam fumes were ignited by the projector's hot circuit board, and the blaze spread to three larger sheets of foam nearby . Remains: This image released at the time showed the devastating extent of the damage to the library. Piece by piece, the rubble was cleared . The alarm was raised as the fire spread through the spray foam to the larger foam 'walls', but it was too late. The blaze engulfed the basement room and spread to destroy much of the 'iconic and unique' building's west wing. Eyewitnesses described how firefighters in breathing apparatus stood shoulder to shoulder, forming a human line between the inferno and the unaffected sections of the art school, preventing the blaze from spreading. Other firefighters then darted in and out of the building, despite the flames, to remove irreplaceable paintings and furniture by Mackintosh after being shown photographs of the artefacts by curators and told where to find them. No one was injured in the fire, which after a six-month investigation was put down to a tragic accident by the art school's leaders. Nine months later, builders are still assessing the extent of the damage as they stabilise the building to prepare for its restoration. Behind the hoardings: Builders are due to finish their work next month, giving way to nine months of design work for a restored building . Blackened: A view of the top-floor professors' studios in the Mackintosh Building, which remain open to the air nine months after the fire . Open air: Chiefs hope a fully-restored art school with an exhibition space and visitor centre will open in 2018 or 2019, costing up to £35m . Intact: A spokesman said the 'hen run' on the roof of the building (pictured), which many thought lost, is in fact still structurally sound . Long journey: The Treasury has given £5m and fundraisers have handed over £1m so far, which the Scottish Government has vowed to match . Hard at work: The building was insured for £50m but art school chiefs will receive nowhere near that amount, as the east wing was untouched . Thousands of damaged pieces of building material, including blackened stones from the library walls, have been removed and numbered with chalk in the hope that experts can put them back where they were before. The building was insured for £50million but art school chiefs will receive nowhere near that amount, because the east wing was almost completely untouched by the fire. However, they have already received £5million from the Treasury in Whitehall, £1million from fundraisers and another £1million in match funding from the Scottish Government. Builders are finally due to finish assessing the damage next month, at which a firm of architects will be chosen to lead the restoration project. Design work will take nine months with builders returning to the site early next year. Chiefs hope a fully-restored art school with an exhibition space and visitor centre will open in 2018 or 2019. Numbered: Blackened stones from the walls of the building have been labelled with chalk in the hope they can return to their original positions . Artefacts: Hundreds of items which were recovered after the fire have been carefully catalogued, some of them placed in plastic bags . Ornate: A plaster cast on the building which survived the blaze (left) and a 1901 memorial plaque to one-time chairman Sir James Fleming . The project is set to cost anywhere between £20million and £35million, and the finished building will not necessarily resemble the design by Charles Rennie Mackintosh. Art school leaders are tight-lipped about exactly what the design will look like, but they insist it will be 'holistic' and consistent across the whole building. At the time the Glasgow School of Art vowed the library would ‘rise like a phoenix from the ashes’, partly thanks to detailed blueprints which were left to the school by Mackintosh himself. ‘Mackintosh was an amazing designer but he used ordinary materials,' said a spokesman last May. 'Those materials are still available today and we have the plans for the library and the photographs, so we can rebuild it. It won’t be tomorrow but we will make it happen.'","Century-old library at Glasgow School of Art designed by Charles Rennie Mackintosh was destroyed last May .

"A damning report from the Australian Human Rights Commission has found that hundreds of children threatened to or committed self harm in immigration detention. In a ten-month long inquiry, the Commission found that Australia's practice of holding children in detention violates human rights law, and recommended that they should be released as soon as possible into the community. The long-awaited report, titles 'The Forgotten Children', called for a royal commission into the treatment of children in immigration detention after concluding that prolonged detainment caused significant mental and physical harm. Scroll down for video . The Australian Human Rights Commission has found that hundreds of children threatened to or committed self harm in immigration detention . Hundreds of assaults against children were reported and 128 teenagers harmed themselves between January 2013 and March 2014. Commission President Gillian Triggs said that the Australian government's amendments to the Migration Act which redefined the term 'refugee' was of 'profound concern'. 'It is imperative that Australian governments never again use the lives of children to achieve political or strategic advantage,' she said. 'The aims of stopping people smugglers and deaths at sea do not justify the cruel and illegal means adopted,' she told SBS. 'Australia is better than this.' The report stated that 'there appears to be no rational explanation for the prolonged detention of children.' The report, released on Wednesday, stated that 'The mandatory and prolonged immigration detention of children is in clear violation of international human rights law.' A picture drawn by a 14-year-old detained at the Christmas Island Detention Centre . A picture drawn by a six-year-old detained at the Christmas Island Detention Centre . The commission called for the Federal government to ban indefinite detention, close the 'harsh and cramped' Christmas Island immigration centre, get children off Nauru and appoint an independent guardian for unaccompanied minors. However, Attorney-General George Brandis told parliament that the recommendations had been a longstanding point of difference between the government and the commission. 'The government does not accept the commission's findings,' he said. Mr Brandis said that the Federal government had made 'significant progress' towards changing the conditions of detention centres since the Commission's inquiry had started. 'In short, children in detention is a problem created exclusively by the former Labor Government, which has largely been solved by the current Abbott Government,' he told SBS. Immigration Minister Peter Dutton (left) took on the job in late December and said many of the recommendations reflected existing government policies and were superfluous . Greens immigration spokeswoman Sarah Hanson-Young said the report must be the turning point to end the cruel practice of locking children in detention camps . GetUp Campaigns Chief Erin McCallum said that the findings of the report were concerning. 'Whatever your political persuasion, locking up innocent kids in hideous detention camps is barbaric and it has to stop,' she said. Greens immigration spokeswoman Sarah Hanson-Young said the report must be the turning point to end the cruel practice of locking children in detention camps. 'This vile, institutionalised child abuse has to end,' she said in a statement. 'No longer can we turn a blind eye to the sexual, physical and psychological abuse that these policies of indefinite detention are inflicting on children.' Immigration Minister Peter Dutton - who only took on the job in late December - said many of the recommendations reflected existing government policies and were superfluous. Activist group ChilOut said children must only be detained as a measure of last resort and only for the shortest appropriate period . 'Other recommendations would mean undermining the very policies that mean children don't get on boats in the first place,' he said in a statement. Numbers of children in immigration detention peaked at nearly 2000 in mid-2013 under Labor but now there are only 162 children still detained. Activist group ChilOut said children must only be detained as a measure of last resort and only for the shortest appropriate period. 'This report highlights our dramatic failure to uphold our obligations, by detaining children arbitrarily as punishment for seeking asylum,' it said in a statement. Opposition immigration spokesman Richard Marles said Labor would work through the report findings and recommendations and respond appropriately. 'The best thing we can do for children in detention is to have refugee claims processed quickly so nobody has to languish in detention with no hope of settlement,' he said in a statement.","Ten-month long inquiry was conducted by the Human Rights Commission .

"Lawyers for the captain of the capsized Costa Concordia have made a last-ditch appeal, asking the Italian court trying him for the 2012 shipwreck to consider errors of other crew, not just his conduct. The court in Grosseto will soon deliberate the fate of Francesco Schettino, who is charged with manslaughter in the deaths of 32 people, abandoning ship before all of the 4,200 passengers and crew were evacuated, and causing the shipwreck. The Concordia smashed into a reef when sailing too close to Giglio Island, causing the vessel the capsize. Schettino's lawyers have denied that their client acted like a 'reckless idiot'. Survivors have previously spoken of their shock of seeing the skipper - who has been dubbed 'Captain Coward' - standing on the shore after the disaster without even getting his feet wet. Scroll down for video . Plea: Lawyers for Francesco Schettino (pictured arriving in Grosseto this morning) have made a last-ditch appeal for the court trying him for the 2012 shipwreck to consider errors of other crew, not just his conduct . Awaiting his fate: Schettino is pictured arriving at the courthouse in Grosseto, Tuscany this morning . Claim: The Concordia smashed into a reef when sailing too close to Giglio Island. Lawyers for Francesco Schettino (pictured in court earlier in the trial) have denied that their client acted like a 'reckless idiot' This morning lawyer Donato Laino says prosecutors built their case 'around one person, not the facts', adding that Mr Schettino believes he is being made a scapegoat for wider failings. Schettino faces up to 26 years in prison on charges of causing the shipwreck, with the Grosseto court handing potentially down a verdict as early as this evening. Investigators have severely criticised his handling of the disaster, accusing him of bringing the 290 metre-long vessel too close to shore when it struck rocks off the Tuscan island of Giglio, tearing a hole in its side and setting off a chaotic night evacuation of more than 4,000 passengers and crew. He has also been accused of delaying evacuation and losing control of the operation during which he abandoned ship before all the 4,200 passengers and crew had been rescued. Prosecutors have asked for a sentence of 26 years in prison for Schettino, who has admitted some responsibility as captain of the ship but denies blame for deaths that occurred during evacuation. This morning he was left alone in the dock to answer for the disaster after the ship's owners Costa Cruises, a unit of Carnival Corp, paid a €1 million fine to settle. Prosecutors also accepted plea bargains from five other officials, none of whom were jailed. Moniker: Survivors have previously spoken of their shock of seeing Francesco Schettino (pictured) - who has been dubbed 'Captain Coward'- standing on the shore after the disaster without even getting his feet wet . Disaster: The wreck of the Costa Concordia lying on its side after it smashed into a reef near Giglio Island, with 32 people on board losing their lives . The Costa Concordia wreck was one of the highest-profile shipping disasters of recent years, leaving the massive hulk abandoned on its side for two-and-a-half years before it was towed away in the most expensive maritime wreck recovery in history. Schettino's defence team argued he prevented an even worse disaster by steering the ship close to the island as it sank. They say the sentence sought by prosecutors goes beyond even sentences sought for mafia killers. 'I believe and hope that the court will be able to establish the fact that the deaths happened after the impact,' his lawyer Domenico Pepe told reporters. Schettino, a distinctive figure with his sharp suits and pomaded hair, has been a constant presence throughout the trial in a makeshift courtroom set up in a theatre in Grosseto. Questions have also been asked about the safety procedures and the wider responsibilities of ship operators Carnival. Giuliano Leuzzi, a lawyer representing consumer organisation Codacons, a civil party in the case said: 'We need to establish the real responsibilities and each party should take responsibility for their share.'","Lawyers for Francesco Schettino make last-ditch appeal in Italian court .

"A judge in the U.S has ruled that labeling homosexuality 'a disease' in adverts for controversial gay conversion therapy groups is fraud. Superior Court Judge Peter F. Barsio Jr ruled on Tuesday that using the claim in marketing is a violation of New Jersey's consumer protection laws. The state judge made the ruling as part of a consumer fraud lawsuit filed against Jews Offering New Alternatives for Healing (JONAH), a New Jersey-based conversion therapy provider. A judge in the U.S has ruled that labeling homosexuality 'a disease' in adverts for controversial gay conversion therapy groups is fraud and violates consumer protection laws (file picture posed by models) 'Conversion' or 'reparative' therapy is the attempt by individuals, often posing as professionals, to try and alter the sexuality of lesbian, gay or bisexual patients. The Southern Poverty Law Center brought the lawsuit on behalf of four gay ex-JONAH clients, claiming the group used 'deceptive practices' to lure clients to pay for gay-to-straight therapy - which  can cost more than $10,000 a year, reports NBC. Judge Barsio wrote in his ruling: 'It is a misrepresentation in violation of the CFA (Consumer Fraud Act), in advertising or selling conversion therapy services to describe homosexuality, not as being a normal variation of human sexuality, but as being a mental illness, disease, disorder, or equivalent.' He added JONAH was violating the CFA by 'advertising or selling conversion therapy services, to include specific 'success' statistics when there is no factual basis for calculating such statistics.' David Dinielli, SPLC's deputy legal director said in a statement: 'This ruling is monumental and devastating to the conversion therapy industry. 'This is the principal lie the conversion therapy industry uses throughout the country to peddle its quackery to vulnerable clients. 'Gay people don't need to be cured, and we are thrilled that the court has recognized this.' The state judge made the ruling as part of a consumer fraud lawsuit filed against Jews Offering New Alternatives for Healing (JONAH), a New Jersey-based conversion therapy provider (their website is pictured) The UK Council for Psychotherapy states on its website: 'There is no good evidence conversion therapy works and we believe it has the potential to cause harm. 'Often these approaches are based on religious interpretations about sexuality rather than on a researched and informed understanding of sexual orientation.' The American Psychiatric Association said conversion therapy can cause depression and anxiety in patients. JONAH's mission statement says: 'Our Rabbinical sages explain that because mankind has been endowed by our Creator with a free will, everyone has the capacity to change. 'Furthermore, the Rabbis emphasize that parents, teachers and counselors have a special responsibility to educate, nurture, and provide an opportunity for those struggling with unwanted same-sex attractions to journey out of homosexuality. 'Through psychological and spiritual counseling, peer support, and self-empowerment, JONAH seeks to reunify families, to heal the wounds surrounding homosexuality, and to provide hope.'","Superior Court Judge Peter F.

"A hard-working nurse was killed by a lorry outside his own hospital after he tripped on a pavement and fell under the wheels. Male nurse Anecito Obsioma, 55, had volunteered to work an extra shift in the NHS hospital when he fell into the path of the heavy goods truck. An inquest heard the Filipino-born nurse - known to friends as Cito - was supposed to be on a day off. But instead he offered to work an extra shift so he could send more money back to help his family pay for his terminally-ill sister's medical bills in the Philippines. Tragedy: Anecito Obsioma was on his way to work when he tripped and fell under the wheels of a lorry and suffered 'catastrophic injuries'. He was hoping to earn more money to help pay for his sister's medical bills . He stumbled on the kerb and fell under its wheels just yards away from the hospital's A&E department. An inquest heard Mr Obsioma suffered 'catastrophic injuries' after falling under the rear wheels of the Scania lorry as it delivered food to University Hospital of Wales in Cardiff. Doctors and nurses immediately rushed to his aid, but they were unable to save him and he died just hours later. His partner Robert Sullivan said he was 'disgusted' by the state of the pavements at the site of the accident on the roads around the hospital grounds. Repair works at the time forced pedestrians to walk into the road or ambulance bay outside A&E before returning to the pavement where Mr Obsioma tripped. Mr Sullivan said: 'It was his day off but he went in for the overtime to try to earn a bit more money to send home for his sister's medical expenses. 'He loved his work and his patients. He always cared for everyone.' Popular: Mr Obsioma - known as Cito to friends - was hugely popular and described as a devoted nurse who 'loved his work and his patients' Cardiff coroner's court was told Mr Obsioma had been a theatre nurse for 10 years at the largest hospital in Wales. On the morning of the tragedy he was 'a little bit late' as he walked to the hospital from his nearby home in the Cathays area of the Welsh capital. Lorry driver Michael Wilkins told the inquest it was around 8.10am on November 12 last year when he noticed a man, later identified as Mr Obsioma, crossing the road. Mr Wilkins said: 'I saw someone walking on my left hand side and as I passed him he seemed to be stepping onto the pavement when he stumbled. 'I looked in my left wing mirror and I saw him hit the side of the truck and bounce off it and fall onto the pavement. 'I didn't see if I had run over him. I hit the brakes and ran back and he was on the road and already being looked after by people.' Hospital visitor Geoffrey Watson was driving in the opposite direction when he saw Mr Obsioma stumble and fall under the rear wheels on the lorry. Mr Watson said: 'The pavement wasn't in very good condition and he missed his footing and fell under the back wheels. 'People came out from A&E straight away to attend to him.' CCTV cameras caught the moment the NHS nurse hit the curb with his right foot as he attempted to step back onto the pavement from the road. The inquest heard doctors desperately tried to save their colleague but after two hours he succumbed to the 'catastrophic injuries' he suffered. Accident: The University Hospital of Wales in Cardiff, where Mr Obsioma died . Assistant Coroner Tom Atherton said there were no drugs or alcohol in Mr Obsioma's system which could have led to him being unsteady on his feet that morning. Mr Atherton said Mr Obsioma's died from 'multiple injuries' after the 'tragic accident'. He said: 'It is quite clear he stumbled as he first made contact with the pavement, which caused him to stumble and fall into the road. 'He was most unfortunate that a lorry was passing at the time and as a consequence Cito, having stumbled, fell into the road and under the rear wheels. 'The injuries he received were extremely serious and despite the efforts of the emergency department at the hospital nothing could be done to save his life and he passed away two hours later.' The coroner returned a verdict of accidental death.","Anecito Obsioma tragically killed by 'catastrophic injuries' in freak accident .

Following the autopsy, Cuyahoga County coroners ruled the little girl's death a homicide. Scroll down for video . Trina Whitehead is seen here with her infant daughter Zuri and her three other children. Newborn Zuri went for a sleepover at her best friend's house so that Trina could have time with her other kids .

"Amy Pascal has been announced as the new co-producer for the latest Spider-Man installment . Disgraced Sony boss Amy Pascal is returning to the Hollywood studio just three days after it was announced she was leaving. The executive, whose controversial emails were leaked during the hacking scandal, was revealed as co-producer for the latest installment of the company’s multi-billion pound Spider-Man franchise. The deal, which named Mrs Pascal as part of the new Spider-Man project came on Monday, just three days after it was said she was leaving her post as the co-chairman of Sony Pictures in May. She oversaw the franchise for 13 years at Sony and saw it take more than £2.6billion for the studio worldwide. Part of her deal leaving Sony will see the company fund a production company she is to set up for four years. On top of Spider-Man, she is also reported to be under consideration for the re-make of Ghostbusters. In one of the offensive email exchanges that emerged, Mrs Pascal made racist jokes about the US President, suggesting that he would like films about slavery or that centred on black characters. ‘Should I ask him if he liked Django?,’ she wrote. In some of the leaked messages Mrs Pascal insulted some of the Hollywood studio’s most bankable stars. In one discussion, she told a producer who complained about Leonardo DiCaprio that the Wolf of Wall Street star is ‘actually despicable’. Scroll down for video . Cyber scandal: Producer Scott Rudin and Amy Pascal - at the Sony Golden Globes party in 2011 - were left embarrassed when dozens of their private emails were leaked last year . Angelina Jolie stares pictured with Amy Pascal at The Hollywood Reporter Women in Entertainment Power 100 Breakfast on December 10, 2014 - just days after leaked Sony emails revealed Jolie to be described as a 'minimally talented spoiled brat' Angelina Jolie and Sony boss Amy Pascal in happier times at the Sony Pictures Classic Golden Globe Awards Party held at The Beverly Hilton hotel on January 16, 2011 . She was also involved in a heated exchange with producer Scott Rudin, where Miss Jolie was accused by Rudin of being a ‘minimally talented spoiled brat’. The hack attack was linked to North Korea, and is thought to have been an attempt to force Sony to scrap The Interview, a comedy about the assassination of the country’s leader, Kim Jong-un. Kevin Feige, the producer who has made over $11billion in box office sales, released a statement to say he was working with Mrs Pascal. 'I am thrilled to team with my friends at Sony Pictures along with Amy Pascal to produce the next Spider-Man movie,' he said. 'Amy has been deeply involved in the realization on film of one of the world's most beloved characters. 'Marvel's involvement will hopefully deliver the creative continuity and authenticity that fans demand from the MCU (Marvel Cinematic Universe). I am equally excited for the opportunity to have Spider-Man appear in the MCU, something which both we at Marvel, and fans alike, have been looking forward to for years.' Dumped: Andrew Garfield will not be coming back as Spider-Man in the new reboot, due out in 2017 . Ancient: At 34, Garfield will be considered too old to play the teenage Peter Parker... if indeed the next Spider-Man is Peter Parker . Hot property: Spider-Man is arguably Marvel's most recognizable superhero, but hasn't been doing that well at the box office under Sony . But the statement did not say if Andrew Garfield would be coming back, almost certainly certainly throwing him in the scrap pile along with Tobey Maguire. Marvel's cinema situation is famously a messy one - although the comic house was bought outright by Disney for $4billion in 2009, many of the film rights to its most famous characters had already been sold to rival studios - such as The Fantastic Four and the X-Men to Fox, and Spider-Man to Sony - for far more meager amounts before comic book films were the box office gold they are today. But Sony has been failing to take advantage of owning arguably Marvel most famous son, Spider-Man, as box office performances have been steadily faltering. The most recent film starring Andrew Garfield was murdered at the box office by Marvel's Guardians Of The Galaxy, despite featuring a far less-known line-up of comic book characters. Scrapheap: Garfield joins Tobey Maguire on the list of former Spider-Men, only managing to make two films compared to Maguire's three . The new Spider-Man will make his first appearance in May next year in the eagerly anticipated crossover Civil War, which see's him take the side of Iron Man against Captain America in a war over whether superheros should have to register their powers with the government. Then on July 28, 2017 the new Spider-man will get his own rebooted film franchise - and speculation is rife over who will done the iconic costume: Garfield will be 34 and considered way too old to play the teenage Peter Parker... if indeed it will be Peter Parker. Many fans are calling for the next Spider-Man to be black teenager Miles Morales, who succeeds Parker in the comics. NyDailyNews was among the first to propose a list of viable replacements, including Ansel Elgort, Jack O'Connell, Dylan O'Brien, and Logan Lerman. New boys: Among Spidey's new replacements touted online are The Fault in Our Stars star Ansel Elgort; Unbroken's Jack O'Connell; Teen Wolf Dylan O'Brien; and Fury actor Logan Lerman .

"Brian Williams' six-month suspension from NBC may give him the time to pursue his real passion: comedy. The Nightly News anchor, whose career crumbled this past week as veterans called him out for lying in a report about the Invasion of Iraq, allegedly wanted to give up the news desk years ago to host of the Tonight Show. According to a former colleague quoted in New York magazine, Williams lobbied for the job when the network was looking to replace Jay Leno in 2013 when the veteran host announced his second retirement. Instead the job went to SNL veteran Jimmy Fallon. Scroll down for video . Dream job: A former colleague of Brian Williams revealed that he wanted to give up the anchor desk at the Nightly News to take over the Tonight Show when the network was looking to replace Jay Leno when the veteran host announced his second retirement in 2013 . 'Brian wants to be a late-night comedian,' the former colleague said. 'He traded on being Nightly News anchorman-war-reporter to ingratiate himself with Jimmy [Fallon], Lorne Michaels, and Jon Stewart.' Jay Leno hosted the Tonight Show from 1992 - 2009 and again from 2010 - 2014 . On Friday, NBC News president Deborah Turness released a statement saying Williams would be placed on six month's leave without pay, after it was revealed he lied about a report from 2003. During the U.S. Invasion of Iraq, Williams was embedded with a troop, and while flying in a Chinook helicopter, reported that the aircraft had been hit with a rocket-propelled grenade (RPG). However, soldiers who were on the helicopter with him said it wasn't their aircraft that was hit, but the one in front of them. The old report gained attention again when Williams repeated the story in a recent broadcast. Other reports by Williams have also come into question, such as his dispatches from New Orleans during Hurricane Katrina. Williams was staying at the Ritz-Carlton Hotel in the French Quarter during the disaster and reported that he saw a body face down, floating in the water outside the luxury hotel. However, the French Quarter received little flooding during Katrina, and hotel workers were skeptical of the report. NBC News continues to investigate Williams past reports, and they are also now looking into his expenses. Experts say the continued investigation may mean that Williams' unpaid leave will eventually end in his firing. Meanwhile, back-up anchor Lester Holt has been filling in for Williams this past week, and network executives are said to be monitoring his ratings to see if he can make a full-time replacement.","Former colleague revealed that Williams asked to host the late-night show when NBC was looking to replace Jay Leno .

Sofija Stefanovic intentionally threw herself into the dark world of online dating after an elderly friend of hers went looking for love and was scammed out of more than $80,000. In her quest to speak to a scammer, Sofija even went as far as using her dead relative's photo to set up her own senior's dating profile. Sofija Stefanovic intentionally threw herself into the dark world of online dating after an elderly friend of hers went looking for love and was scammed out of more than $80,000 . She documented the bizarre lengths scammers go to and the awkward flirty conversations she had in her new book, You're Just Too Good To Be True. One of the potential love interests trying to win Sofija over was a person named Cindy - a so-called stylist from Senegal in Africa. Cindy initially thought Sofija was a man and within a day of emailing each other she essentially declared her love. 'When I open my heart for a man and I begine (sic) to have deep feelinsg (sic) for hims that means I fall in love so quick when I meet someone that I like,' Cindy wrote. When she asked for pictures Sofija decided to come clean hoping to catch her off guard. She told her she was actually a woman and she only pretended to be a man to keep her talking. 'I want to know what you believe in. Do you like men or women? Cindy wrote. 'I was thinking and believing in the way I was brought up, that a woman should like only a man. But I have come to realized that woman like womand (sic) and men same... I would love to try it with you. If you wouldn't mind.' Sofija Stefanovic created fake dating profiles using a number of profile pictures including this one so she could speak with dozens of romance scammers . Cindy's snap decision to 'try' a same-sex relationship left Sofija stunned. '(Scammers) have all these flattering things they copy and paste into conversations. I thought if I did something out of left field I'd catch her off guard. She was pretty amazing,' Sofija told Daily Mail Australia. 'I would really love to know who that was. You know, if it was an 18-year-old guy in some internet cafe laughing with his mates.' Sofija pursued an online relationship with Cindy over several months mainly on instant messenger. She called her a few times, but Cindy refused to have a Skype conversation. 'Cindy was the most amazing scammer. She doesn't like soccer but I was watching the world cup and she ended up watching just for me,' Sofija said.

'Some scammers belong to large syndicates and they're talking to lots of victims at once. They have these databases that could say: ""This is Sofija, she likes the world cup"".'

"A suspected paedophile allegedly beaten to death by a British ex-pat in Spain once acted as an assistant to Katie Price, it was claimed today. Photographs have emerged showing Sandro Rottman with the model and her ex-husband Alex Reid in Sotogrande during the launch of her polo riding range in August 2009. The German died in the same resort on Sunday after a British father named locally as Devinder Kainth, 40, caught him photographing his daughter on an iPad and attacked him. A Briton, Fiona Goodwood – who has known Mr Rottman for the last 12 years and described him as 'something of an eccentric character' – said he told her he had assisted Miss Price on the trip.

Helping hand: It is understood that Mr Rottman was very close to the entourage and was involved in organising the event . Another British expat who has known Mr Rottman for eight years claimed he had 'attached himself to the couple' when Katie came to open her clothes line KP Equestrian in the  resort. The source said: 'He had slick-backed hair and was always dressed very smartly'. A spokeswoman for Miss Price told MailOnline: 'Katie was present at an event where Mr Rottman was working for the organisers. 'She has no recollection of meeting him, but it appears she did during the course of her one day working trip to Sotogrande. 'This is clearly a tragic incident that will impact the families of all involved.' It came after a disturbing picture emerged of Mr Rottman holding a young girl to his chest which he had posted on Twitter. The 43-year-old, who who was arrested over child pornography a few days before his death, wrote: 'Just finished a day with the most beautiful girl in the Beach Club of Sotogrande. 'Hope one day I will have one my own.'

Mr Rottman is seen here (far right) at the Santa Maria Polo Club with Katie Price and Alex Reid . Rottman was arrested on January 9 and, according to the Guardia Civil, the case was still open when he died, it was reported by Spanish daily newspaper El Pais. Kainth was having a family meal at a restaurant in exclusive Sotogrande, on the Costa del Sol in Spain, when he confronted Rottman after allegedly catching him taking pictures on his iPad. The millionaire, a keen boxer, hurled the iPad to the ground before punching the German, who died in hospital of his injuries. Yesterday, details emerged of the attack on Saturday night. The owner of the Spinnaker restaurant told the Mail: 'After an afternoon of friendly chatter, the British man suddenly told his family to leave. 'Devinder looked at Sandro's iPad and found pictures of his family which had been taken earlier that evening. He was shouting: 'Why have you taken these?' 'Suddenly he told his family to get out of the bar. Five seconds later, he hit Sandro so hard he fell to the floor. I think this knocked him out or at least dazed him. 'Then Devinder went crazy and started hitting Sandro. He must have hit him at least 20 times in the face and head. '[Sandro] had blood gurgling from his mouth. He was choking and struggling to breathe. He also had a big lump on the side of his head – no other visible cuts – just this big lump. 'Then he was unconscious like he was in a coma. The waitress started screaming for help. 'We were all shaking and trembling. When [Devinder] ran out of energy, he calmly got up and walked out the door.'

British father Victor Kainth (left) allegedly beat a suspected paedophile to death after catching the man filming his daughter on his iPad while eating at a Spanish restaurant with his partner Gemma Hawkins (right) A staff member who watched CCTV footage of the incident said: 'He dragged him along the floor like a dog.' Kainth was arrested and is being held at high security Botafuegos Prison, in the southern port of Algeciras. His partner Gemma Hawkins, 31, the mother of his daughter and two sons, has been interviewed by police. There was no sign of her last night at their home or at the £8,000-a-year school of two of the children. Miss Hawkins, from Kent, was described as a 'blonde bombshell' who 'turned heads'. The millionaires' playground of Sotogrande is known for its large houses and golf courses such as the world-famous Valderrama Club. It is a favourite of former prime minister Tony Blair as well as the Duchess of York and her daughters Beatrice and Eugenie. The head chef at the Spinnaker restaurant where the incident took place is Austrian Philip Hannig, who spent a year training under Gordon Ramsay. According to witnesses, Mr Kainth and his partner, Gemma Hawkins, were eating with their three children (pictured, above, with Ms Hawkins) when they started chatting to Sandro Rottman . Two of the couple's children attend one of the most exclusive schools on the Spanish coast where fees are around 10,000 euros a year. The third goes to nursery . A worker at the nearby El Octogono Beach Club said the worrying photo on Mr Rottman's Twitter account was taken at its children's pool. The barman, who asked not to be named, said the girl was the daughter of Britons who spend every summer there. Of Rottman, a web designer, he said: 'He had a drink problem and would get through up to three bottles of vodka a day. 'He's been banned for the past year because he ran up a huge bill. 'He'd fallen on hard times after making a lot of money during the boom years in Spain when he was spending £50 a day on drink. He drank vodka and orange juice. 'He dressed well in smart trousers and a blazer even in the hard times. 'He was always on his own and always on his computer because that was how he made his money, but I never saw him misbehaving.' Rottman is said to have once been so drunk he fell into the sea and had to be rescued. He limped and is said to have been treated for a liver problem. A British man has been arrested for allegedly killing a German man he caught filming his young daughter in a restaurant in Sotogrande on Spain's Costa del Sol on Saturday night . The altercation happened at the The Spinnaker, pictured above, in Sotogrande on Spain's Costa del Sol on Saturday night after Devinder Kainth  reportedly saw Sandro Rottman filming his daughter . Kainth is a gym fanatic who worked out on most days and did gruelling Crossfit classes. He has a three-bedroom house in the area and once owned a supermarket in nearby Casares, but it has closed, sources said. The couple were said to be well known in the resort for their 'matching his-and-hers black and white Range Rovers' and their expensive spending habits. Ms Hawkins is also believed to be a fitness fanatic like her partner. Various people in the resort have described her as a 'blonde bombshell' with a 'cracking body'. A waitress in a restaurant in the resort said: 'When she walked into the restaurant all heads turned'. Another source added that she's 'better seen and not heard' and a 'real Cockney London girl'. The family moved to Sotogrande full-time a year ago, although apparently they have been going to the resort for years. A neighbour said: 'The last time I saw him and his partner here was last August. They had an argument round the pool one day. 'I couldn't understand what they were saying but he seemed very aggressive. His girlfriend left in tears and started throwing his clothes out of the window.' Kainth appeared before a magistrate on Monday and was remanded in custody accused of homicide.

"It has been revealed that the 12-year-old girl who married a man in an Islamic ceremony was pregnant at the time the 26-year-old Lebanese student was charged with ongoing child sex abuse. The pair held the 'wedding', which is alleged to have been arranged by her father, in the girl's lounge room in the Hunter region in NSW, in January last year. Not long after the man, now 27, and can not be named for legal reasons, was charged with one count of persistent sexual abuse of a child, the girl was diagnosed with an ectopic pregnancy and then miscarried in February after complaining of  abdominal pain,The Daily Telegraph reported. The girl, now 13, didn't want to marry the student because of the 14 year age gap but the man bombarded her with text messages after he first laid eyes on her in a mosque in November 2013, the court papers stated on Wednesday. A 27-year-old man, pictured at Burwood Local Court in May, has pleaded guilty to ongoing child sex abuse . The man pleaded guilty in Burwood Local Court in October to one count of persistent sexual abuse of a child, which carries a 25-year maximum jail sentence. The charge takes in 25 counts of sexual intercourse with a child between 10 and 14, with which the man was originally charged. He was ordered not to contact his victim for two years, and a date for sentencing will be decided next week. Police allege the man married the Hunter Valley girl in an Islamic ceremony earlier last year. The girl's father will face trial this year. The father, who is in his 60s, allegedly arranged the illegal marriage. The 27-year-old Lebanese student, who can't be named, pleaded guilty in Burwood Local Court on Thursday to one count of persistent sexual abuse of a child . The father allegedly organised his daughter's marriage to the Lebanese immigrant because he wanted to stop her from 'committing a life of sin'. He was charged with procuring a child under 14 for unlawful sexual activities, and being an accessory before the fact to sexual intercourse with a person under 14. Court documents say the girl met the 27-year-old man at a mosque in November 2013  after he approached her father and asked to meet her. Police allege the young girl's father enabled his daughter's sexual assault by organising the unlawful marriage - including allowing them to swap phone numbers and meet three times in the family home before the ceremony. The couple spent their wedding night at a motel in the Hunter region where they had sex several times, police allege. A week after the wedding, the father asked the girl's older siblings to put two single mattresses next to each other to make a queen size bed so the couple had a bed in the family home. The imam who performed the ceremony pleaded guilty to solemnising the marriage and was fined $500. In court documents it is claimed that since the marriage the pair engaged in sexual activities on a daily basis until February when their relationship was discovered by a Centrelink worker, when the man tried to get registered as the girl’s legal guardian in order to obtain welfare benefits. 'The girl has expressed a strong desire to start a family with the [then] 26-year-old,' the police report states. The man has had his student visa cancelled and is now living in an immigration detention centre.","Man, 26, 'married' girl,12, in Islamic ceremony in her lounge room in NSW .
