"By . Ruth Styles . and Martha Cliff . With his jet black locks, inky eyeliner and multiple tattoos, it's safe to say that 23-year-old Kieran Martin from South Shields is not your average model. But he - and fellow 'alternative models' - are becoming increasingly popular with magazines and brands who put quirky cool ahead of conventional beauty. Indeed, so popular has the tattooed and pierced look become, Mr Martin has even launched an alternative modelling competition which scours the country looking for potential new faces. Scroll down for video . Striking: Model Iska Ithil (left) is one of the UK's top alternative models and is seen here with Darren McMullen . Entrepreneur: Kieran Martin, 23, is the man behind the UK's biggest alternative modelling competition . 'We have had a lot of interest,' he reveals. 'We've had . over 200 applicants already this year and we're expecting another 250 at our London auditions in July.' And Mr Martin might find himself with even more than he bargained for, thanks to a new documentary that's set to raise the profile of alternative modelling even more. Outsiders With Darren McMullen, which will be screened tonight on National Geographic, features last year's competition and focuses on top alternative model, Iska Ithil. Iska - real name Katherine - boasts rainbow hair, pink eyebrows and multiple piercings, and has appeared in Vogue as well as in a campaign for optical chain, Specsavers. 'I think when you go this far you have to . make, you have to make sacrifices,' she tells McMullen in the documentary. 'Because how I look is a permanent . thing, it doesn’t matter like how casual I try and dress - I still stand . out, and there are  days that you just want to kind of walk down the . street and just just to blend in.' But this is one industry where standing out is the name of the game, as Mr Martin explains. 'We look for an alternative style, a good image and plenty of confidence,' he reveals. Looking good: Most alternative models boast an unusual look, complete with tattoos and numerous piercings . Popular: Many alternative models have body art - something that is requested by many clients . And confidence is something you'll . certainly find plenty of at Mr Martin's competitions, with many entrants . saying that modelling has been just what they need to give their self . esteem a boost. Among them is Lisa Eagleton, winner of last year's 'Best Look' award, who lost her right leg seven years ago in a car accident and was dumped by her partner shortly afterwards. 'My partner didn't fancy me once I’d lost my leg,' she says. 'So as a result I . didn’t feel very good as a woman. 'I was on Facebook one night and got . offered a chance to do a photo shoot to make myself feel better, then I . continued on to do more, and as a result of doing the modelling, I . gained more confidence.' Today, her life has been transformed thanks to her later life career as an alternative model. 'As a mum with four daughters I wanted to show to them that you don’t . have to be what the media deems to be perfect,' she adds. To see the collection click here . Confidence: According to Kieran, the experience of being photographed is a real confidence boost for many . Catching up: So popular are alternative models, they have appeared everywhere from Vogue to Specsavers . 'As long as you’re happy with you and you’re happy with who you are, you can be anything.' Mr Martin agrees: 'A lot of the entrants were bullied at school and have been quite self-conscious . about how they look,' he confirms. 'This is a great platform for them to gain . confidence.' So what does it take to make it as an alternative model? According to top agent Asha Tank, founder of Dark Arts Alternative Model Agency, the answer is boasting looks that are as striking as possible. 'You need to be different to the norm,' she tells McMullen. 'Not what you’d see on those normal model agency books really - someone you would maybe look twice at in the street and go ""ooh that’s unusual"". Someone striking, someone edgy.' You don't, however, need to go on a diet or even check your birth certificate. Unlike mainstream models, alternative models can be all sizes, shapes and ages. All welcome: Kieran says anyone can enter an alternative modelling competition, regardless of age or size . Successful: Iska Ithil, one of the UK's most successful alternative models, with Darren McMullen and a snake . 'We let absolutely anyone enter, any size, . any image,' explains Mr Martin. 'They will be given a fair audition which includes two photo . shoots and a mini catwalk. 'We don't have any age limit,' he adds. 'We start at . 13 and just go upwards. Our oldest contestants from last year were in their 50s - we . don't discriminate.' And for those who do make it, the rewards can be lucrative. 'Our winners earn a contract with The Twisted Agency,' he explains. 'Our 2012 winner, Johnny George, has been on the catwalk,' adds Mr Martin with a satisfied smile. 'I think that the fashion industry is finally . starting to change and accept alternative style.'

"By . Ray Massey, Transport Editor . One in 20 drivers unknowingly suffers from a sleeping disorder that puts them at risk of nodding off at the wheel, the RAC warns today. It says 1.4million motorists are a risk to themselves and other road users due to Obstructive Sleep Apnoea Syndrome. Research suggests the problem may be responsible for up to one in five accidents and is increasing with growing cases of obesity and sedentary lifestyles. Nodding off? One in 20 drivers suffers Obstructive Sleep Apnoea which contributes to accidents (file photo) It said that in tests of simulated driving, ‘sleep apnoea patients had a driving performance at least as bad as drivers over the alcohol limit’. The RAC said: ‘It is a serious condition where the muscles in the throat relax too much during sleep, obstructing the airway, which causes the sufferer to temporarily stop breathing and consequently repeatedly wake up to start breathing again. Severe: The condition affects more than a million Britons (file photo) ‘The sufferer is usually unaware this is going on and it can occur hundreds of times in a night, leading to daytime sleepiness and other serious health problems. ‘Those drivers who have the condition, but who are not being treated, are six times more likely to have an accident than others.’ The RAC, which has joined forces with the Sleep Apnoea Partnership Group to raise awareness, said: ‘While 400,000 people have been diagnosed and are being treated for the condition, it is believed that up to 1.4million drivers have not been diagnosed.’ Effective treatment is available which can address the symptoms very quickly and enable patients to again drive safely, it adds. Professor John Stradling, a leading sleep clinician, said: ‘The usual treatment is to use a simple continuous positive airway pressure device while asleep. ‘Typically, sufferers are often overweight and that extra weight around the neck puts pressure on the throat. ‘A sedentary kind of lifestyle only makes the condition worse, and people who spend a long time behind the wheel seem to be especially at risk.’ If the sleepiness is sufficient to impair driving, the sufferer must notify the DVLA and will be advised to stop driving. ‘But the treatment available today is very effective and need not necessitate a long period of time off the road,’ he added. Danger: Motorway driving makes people more prone to sleep because it is repetitive and hypnotic . Cases have increased as levels of obesity have risen, with nocturnal symptoms including loud snoring, pauses in breathing, occasional choking sensations and restless sleep. In the case of ‘OSAS’ further symptoms are present, most notably daytime sleepiness and reduced ability to concentrate. If this sleepiness is sufficient to impair driving, the sufferer must notify the DVLA and will be advised to stop driving. Prof Stradling added: ‘We fully understand that there is a very reasonable concern among drivers about losing their driving licence, but the treatment available today is very effective and need not necessitate a long period of time off the road.’ RAC technical director David Bizley said driving on a motorway can exacerbate the problem as it can be extremely monotonous and hypnotic, particularly if people are already feeling sleepy. ‘The consequences of falling asleep at the wheel can be catastrophic, both for the driver themselves and anybody in their vicinity,' he said. ‘But it’s also important to emphasise there is a solution as very effective treatment is available. If you suspect that you may have the condition, speak to your GP and get it checked out.’","Many drivers suffer from Obstructive Sleep Apnoea Syndrome, said RAC .

"By . Katy Winter . and Naomi Greenaway . Eat your heart out Demi Moore, Madonna and J Lo, there's a new cougar in town - and she's out done all of you by dating a man 60 years her junior. And what's more, as these pictures show, he's not bad looking either. Ninety-one-year-old great-granny Marjorie McCool has been dating 31-year-old Kyle Jones for five years. And in case you're wondering, the couple, who appeared on ITV's This Morning, have a rampant sex life, and a good one at that.Scroll down for video . Kyle Jones, 31, with Marjorie McCool, 91, who appeared on This Morning via satellite from Pennsylvania . 'The sex is great!' Kyle told Phillip Schofield and Holly Willoughby as the presenters visibly struggled to keep a straight face. When the hosts tried to unpick Kyle's attraction for his great-granny girlfriend, Kyle from Florida, explained, 'Everyone has their thing that they like. It's hard to explain what visually attracts me to Marjorie, but I like the platinum hair, I like the skin, I like the features.' 'If wanted cheerleaders, I would have cheerleaders – you have to go for what you’re attracted to. But the attraction is definitely physical,' he added. If you're wondering, as host Schofield did, whether Marjorie is up to the task of satisfying a young healthy red blooded male, fear not. 'Sweety, I can put my leg up on his shoulder. I’m not kidding. I have pictures to prove it,' she confirmed. ‘I get good loving and lots of attention,’ she added, but admitted at first she was surprised by his attention. ‘I’ve often dated younger men but not that much younger,' she said via satellite from Pittsburgh Pennsylvania, where the 91-year-old lives. Kyle and Marjorie stroll along arm-in-arm in Pittsburgh . Even though the pair get it on regularly, their relationship isn't exclusive. 'I don’t really mind, I did at first but I got over it,' said Marjorie of their arrangement. 'I’m the oldest and feel privileged. It’s odd for a woman this age to have such a younger guy and it’s thrilling.' Kyle said, ‘We have a very physical relationship. We talk on the phone every now and then, but it’s very sexual. We’ve been out a couple of times but generally it’s very physical.' When Philip asked bluntly whether they just meet up to have sex, Kyle replied, ‘It sounds so dirty when you put it that way. But that’s accurate.' One downside for Kyle is that the families are often suspicious. But the couple confirm Marjorie has no money and deny he has any financial motivation. Kyle Jones, 31, says he has never dated a woman his own age, shares a tender kiss with Marjorie McCool, 91 at a local park . 'Often their kids don’t like me and we can’t change that,' he said. 'I often get accused of being some kind of vulture. People think it's linked to inheritance, but not at all.' The other issue Kyle faces, is that his lady lovers are often nearing the end of their lives. 'When I went back to Florida, three of the . women I had been seeing there were no longer with us,' he said. 'I don’t believe in karma . but I could walk outside and get hit by a car so generally it's not something I think about. 'I’ve never wanted kids. I’m not against the idea of being with one women but I haven’t found someone who’s stopped me in my tracks. But that doesn't prevent Kyle from taking his granny girlfriends home to meet his mum. ‘Mums OK with it,' he said. 'At first she thought it was phase, but however many years later she now thinks, ""That’s just Kyle"".' Kyle, who says says that he always been attracted to older women, has even taken girlfriend Marjorie McCool, 91 (L) home to meet his mother Ceceila Jones (R) Kyle, who's previously appeared on TV across the pond said, 'Everyone's brain is wired differently, some guys prefer blondes, some brunettes, some like other guys - I like old ladies.' The call centre worker was just 18 when he first acted on his attraction for older women and began a sexual relationship with a 50-year-old. Now Kyle uses dating websites to find women as well as chatting them up in his daily life. He said: 'Most of the time, the average age I go for is between 60 and 80. 'Whenever I'm trying to speak to an older woman, the first reaction I get is 'you're way too young'. 'I find persistence is good so I tell them it'll be fun.' As well as Marjorie, 91, (left) Kyle is currently dating, Anna Reimol, 67, (right) and another three older women . Despite a 60 year age gap, the couple say they have an excellent and active sex life . In 2009 he met great-grandmother Marge - short for Marjorie - in the bookstore where she was working and asked for her number. Marge, who had been single for 37 years since splitting with the father of her six children, agreed to go on a date. She said: 'In the beginning I got jealous of his other women but he keeps coming back to me and tells me I'm the best. 'The physical side of our relationship is wonderful. I amaze myself, he amazes me. There's nothing better. Kyle mother Ceceila, (R) says she has realised that her sons preference for older women like Marjorie (L) is more than a phase . 'I wear sexy outfits to bed. I try to keep my bra on though because I don't have much left. 'My family consists mostly of boys, and they don't really care - what I do is my business. 'Their ages are 71, 63, 61, 52 and 50. 'When people see us out together they probably think that he's my son, or maybe even a grandson. I have grandsons older.' And while many of the women he dates can't believe such a young man would find them attractive, Kyle is adamant he does. He said: 'Often, the things women are so self-conscious about is what I'm into. I like the neck lines and wrinkles. 'Women worry about their boobs sagging but I think the natural hang looks great. I'm really not a fan of plastic surgery. 'I don't like to say gray, I'm a fan of platinum hair. I prefer it natural.' Kyle's mother, Ceceila Jones Clark, 50, said: 'I think a lot of children have crushes on their teachers, so it didn't strike me as strange. 'I really wasn't sure if that was something that he was going to stay with or if it was just a cougar phase some young men go through. 'However, later when I saw the kind of women he was spending time with I knew it wasn't a phase.'","Kyle Jones and Marjorie McCool appeared on This Morning to talk about their five-year relationship .

"By . Jenny Hope . A £1million investigation in to the affects of mobile phone on the attention span and memory of young people has been launched by scientists (library image) The world’s largest ever study into whether mobile phones are interfering with children’s brains has been launched by British scientists. The £1million investigation will examine whether memory, attention and other thinking skills are affected by radiation from the devices. The findings of the study, which will involve 2,500 children aged 11 and 12, will help update advice to parents about safe levels of use. Current guidelines are a decade old. An estimated 70 per cent of 11- to 12-year-olds in the UK now own a mobile phone. By age 14, the figure is 90 per cent. There is no conclusive evidence that mobile phones damage adult health. But a study earlier this month suggested those who talk on their mobile for more than 15 hours a month – or half an hour a day – are three times more likely to develop brain cancer. It is thought children may be more vulnerable to any damage due to their developing nervous systems and thinner skulls, which may absorb higher levels of energy. Paul Elliott, a professor in environment and health at Imperial College London, is helping lead the study. He said the front and temporal lobes of the brain were close to where a mobile phone was used. He added: ‘When children get to secondary school their brains are still developing, particularly the frontal lobe which deals with reasoning and working memory and the temporal lobe which deals with speech.’ The research team says   exposure to radio waves is lower with later phones and varies between models. Professor Elliott said: ‘Evidence available to date is reassuring and shows no association between exposure to radio frequency waves from mobile phone use and brain cancer in adults in the short term. ‘But the evidence available regarding long-term heavy use and children’s use is limited and less clear. This is new technology and it is widespread –  it is responsible to investigate whether it is having an effect.’ An estimated 70 per cent of 11- to 12-year-olds in the UK now own a mobile phone. By age 14, the figure is 90 per cent, data suggests (library image) More than 160 secondary schools in the outer London area will today receive invitations to enrol pupils aged 11 and 12 into the study. Parents will be asked to give permission for their children to take part in online assessments of their cognitive skills, and provide information jointly about their lifestyle and level of mobile use, including data from mobile phone firms. Some children will wear monitors to check their level of exposure to radio waves. At the end of the three-year study, children will undergo another battery of tests. The study will not contain a group of children for comparison who do not use mobile phones, partly because it would be impossible to recruit a specific set of non-users. However, some children within the study may not have a phone. Researchers will attempt to attribute any significant changes to mobile phone use or other influences. The findings of the study, commissioned by the Department of Health, are expected in 2018. The cost of Scamp – the Study of Cognition, Adolescents and Mobile Phones – will be split between mobile phone firms and health agencies. Guidelines dating back to 2000 – and barely changed in 2005 – say children under 16 should be encouraged to use mobiles for essential calls only. Where possible children should use a hands-free kit or stick to text messages. When they have to make calls, they are advised to keep them short. Scamp’s principal investigator Dr Mireille Toledano, of Imperial College, said: ‘This will be the largest study in the world to date. We will be able to look at “brain training” from frequent use of mobile phones and any health effects such as headaches and sleep disturbances from using mobile phones late at night.’","£1m investigation will involve 2,500 children aged 11 and 12 .

"By . Chris Brooke . Emma Duffy, 24, has battled anorexia since she was eight . An anorexic woman who has not eaten . for a year could kill herself if the NHS stops treating her in . hospital, her parents warned last night. Emma . Duffy – who has a personality disorder and has tried to commit suicide . nine times – was said to be making good progress until health bosses . ruled they would not fund the £1,000-a-day specialist care she needed. Now . the family of the 24-year-old have released pictures of her plight in . an attempt to save her life because they are so disgusted with the NHS’s . attitude. During her . 16-year battle with anorexia, Miss Duffy has swallowed razor blades, has . been admitted to hospital ‘hundreds of times’ and has been  repeatedly . sectioned under the Mental Health Act. Her parents have been warned on several occasions to prepare for her death after her organs began shutting down. Now . doctors at the hospital in Middlesbrough where she has been treated for . six months have decided to discharge her. As a result, she could be . sent back into the community in days, weighing six stone and refusing . all nutrients. Miss Duffy, . who has only had a liquid diet for the past year, was to have been sent . to The Retreat clinic in York – one of the few units in the country . that treats eating and personality disorders together. Her consultant believed it could help her overcome anorexia and Miss Duffy was confident that it would save her life. But she was told three weeks ago that the NHS would not fund the £1,000-a-day specialist care. She then left the hospital, went by rail to Newcastle and took an overdose of pills. Her family used tracking software on her phone to find her and save her life. Her parents have now set up an internet appeal to raise £1million for three years of treatment. Scroll down for video . Harrowing images released by Emma's family show her being tube fed, such is the deterioration in her condition. She has not eaten food for over a year . Emma three years ago before signs of her eating disorder. Her mother says she also suffers from a personality disorder and has tried to commit suicide nine times . They . are furious with the Health Service for its failure to help her . effectively, even though her father, Alan, 57, works for  the NHS as a . clinical engineering manager. Mother . Beverley, 51, has started the fundraising effort with her youngest . daughter Amy, 20. Mrs Duffy, of Chesterfield, Derbyshire, said Amy’s . sister cannot be watched 24 hours a day at home and is likely to try to . kill herself as soon as she can. Emma aged eight, when she overheard a comment about her weight that triggered her 16-year battle with anorexia . She believes her daughter will also reject the community care doctors have decided to give her instead of treatment in hospital. ‘I . think the attitude of the NHS is disgusting,’ said Mrs Duffy. ‘It comes . down to money. She’s in a worse state now than she was when she was . admitted to hospital. She has had all hope taken away from her. It’s not . safe to discharge her.’ Her . family says funding the expensive treatment to cure her would pay for . itself by stopping her being a long-term burden on the NHS. Mrs . Duffy said her daughter had put on 11lb before she was told her place . at The Retreat would not be funded, and is now refusing liquid . nutrients. ‘She’s getting weaker and she needs help. I hope we can raise the money ourselves before it’s too late for her,’ she said. The problems began when she was eight and heard a dance teacher say another girl was fat. It triggered a lifelong battle against bulimia and anorexia, which she kept secret for years. Mrs . Duffy said: ‘It’s a mental illness, not just about eating.’ As a . teenager, Miss Duffy was thin, fainted regularly and lost a lot of her . hair. At 18, she finally admitted to her mother that she was making . herself sick. She attempted . suicide last October and was admitted to Roseberry Park Hospital in . Middlesbrough under the Mental Health Act and has been there since. ‘They . don’t know what to do with her,’ Amy said. ‘The average stay on that . ward is 21 days. It is a holding place. She needs to go somewhere where . they can treat her eating disorder and her personality disorder. ‘It’s like they are trying to keep her alive, but not saving her.’ Tees, . Esk and Wear Valleys NHS Foundation Trust said: ‘The responsibility for . funding care placements rests with the commissioners of NHS services.’ Around 1.6million people in Britain suffer from eating disorders and a tenth of those are thought to have anorexia. The rest have bulimia or other disorders. Its full name anorexia nervosa, it is often cited as the most lethal mental illness - with a larger ratio sufferers dying than those who have depression or psychosis. Sufferers tend to focus on food but the illness itself stems from low self-esteem and an inability to cope safely with . worries, problems and a lack of control. Many who have anorexia lower their food intake by skipping . meals and cutting down the types and amounts of food they eat; some over-exercise. Aside from catastrophically severe weight loss, physical symptoms include difficulty sleeping, dizziness, stomach pains, constipation, feeling cold and hair loss. Periods can stop for women and sufferers grow soft, fine hair all over their bodies in a condition called Lanugo. Although researchers are given figures by hospitals around Britain, it is thought the real toll of sufferers could be much higher because many are reluctant to seek help. One symptom is that sufferers shut themselves off from the world and convince themselves that what they are doing is right, even if they are dangerously underweight. Nine out of ten people with an eating disorder are women - but NHS figures suggest there is a growing number of male sufferers. Specialists tend to use psychological treatments such as counselling, though the most severe cases have to be treated in hospital to ensure patients regain weight safely.

"By . Katy Winter . A self-confessed takeaway queen has managed to shed 8st in 18 months.

'I would have an extra-large pizza to myself and drink a lot of energy drinks. 'I couldn’t even walk to the bus stop without losing my breath. I had severe back pain and was on loads of medication.' But when Lindsey went to the doctors in November 2012, she got the wake-up call she needed. 'The doctor told me I had high cholestorol. I didn’t want to be in my 30s with diabetes,' said Lindsey. 'I was upset, but it was the first time that I had taken a really good look at myself. 'I was literally killing myself with food.'

A newly slim Lindsey, pictured right with an old pair of jeans, now enjoys home cooking and long walks, and hopes to lose more in time for her wedding day . 'Walking into that group was the most nerve-racking thing I’ve ever done. I was scared of being the biggest, of failing, and people taking the mick.

"By . Katy Winter . Jayne and Stephen Moran’s 16-year union was practically over when they discovered a new passion that brought them back together – slimming. The couple from Birmingham, who have two children together, had drifted apart over the years to the point where they shared a home but were leading separate lives. Their obesity had stripped them of their confidence and caused serious health concerns with 27st Stephen at risk of a heart attack and Jayne having suffered a miscarriage which she blamed on her 15st 7lb weight. Jayne and Stephen Moran were facing divorce when the couple decided to loose weight together (left, before they lost weight, right, today) The pair, pictured before weight loss with their two children Danny and Emily, say their busy lives saw them turning to convenient fast food and takeaways . They faced their 40th birthdays fat, unhappy and quite possibly on the brink of divorce. But they fell in love with each other all over again after starting diets on the same day. Shedding the pounds made over their appearance and their marriage and now instead of separation they plan on renewing their wedding vows. They claim dieting together saved their relationship by giving them a shared interested which led to new hobbies and friendships, transforming their marriage. Jayne, 40, a teacher at a school for children with special needs said: ‘Losing the weight together definitely saved our marriage. ‘We had drifted apart to the point where we both felt it was over and that there was nothing we could do, but slimming at the same time gave us something to work on together. It brought us closer together as we supported and helped each other and it reminded us why we made a good couple in the first place. Jayne dropped from 15st 7lb and a size 20 (left) to  9st 13lb and from slim size 8 (right) ‘Now we’re like newlyweds again.’ Jayne was a size 12 when she married a trimmer Stephen who works for the family turfing business, in 2008. They went on have two children, Danny now aged nine and Emily, 14. But juggling full time jobs meant it was easier to turn to take away meals than cook and in time they both ballooned. As they grew further apart food became a comfort but the more weight they gained the less attractive each felt. By 2011 they were leading separate lives. They never socialised together and barely even spoke to each other. In fact the only thing they ever did together was eat. Jayne explains: ‘The only activity we did as a couple was pick what to order from the take away menu and then scoff it together. Food was the only thing we had left in common.’ Stephan dropped from 27st (left) to a trim and far more healthy 13st 10lb (right with Jayne) They hoped another baby might bring them closer together but Jayne struggled to conceive which she blamed on her weight. Then in January last year she was stunned to discover she was pregnant. But at six weeks gone Stephen was rushed to hospital with chest pains. At 27st it was feared he was having a heart attack, but tests were clear and he was discharged in the early hours with a warning to lose weight. Later that day Jayne started to bleed and miscarried their baby. She recalled the midwife warning her she was overweight and knew it put her at a higher chance of miscarriage. At 15st 7lb and just 5ft 2in tall she blamed herself for losing their baby. She . says: ‘I felt it was my fault and that if I had been slimmer and . healthier I wouldn’t have miscarried. I was so angry with myself for not . addressing my weight earlier.’ She . was horrified that their weight had brought so much misery and as she . struggled to come to terms with her grief it looked to be the final nail . in their marriage. She . said: ‘There was so much distance between us. We were both utterly . miserable and I couldn’t see how we could save our marriage. But in June last year after mourning her loss she told Stephen she was going to lose weight and invited him to join her. They both signed up to the Cambridge Weight Loss Plan on the same day. Together . they ditched high calorie junk food for meal replacement shakes and . supported and encouraged each other as they battled through each day. She says: ‘The first few days were very hard. But it felt lovely to be able to support Stephen and he was brilliant with me too. Jayne now enjoys a health balanced diet of lean meat and fish with fruit and vegetables . ‘I remember thinking it was the most we had spoken to each other in months, maybe even years. ‘The longer we stuck to the plan it was like we had something to fight for together. We’d never had the same interests before and had nothing to talk about but we both had a renewed enthusiasm for this.’ As their journey continued and brought them closer, the couple also joined a gym together and working out gave them another shared hobby to enjoy. Jayne said: ‘We were actually enjoying each other’s company and having fun again. It felt wonderful to lose weight but even better to be close again. It was like getting my best friend back.’ Losing weight gave them the energy to take up more activities as a family like bike riding and walking and introduced them to new friends they met at the gym. Jayne said: ‘ We started going out together as a couple and as a family, something we’d never done in the past. ‘Now we have lots of hobbies we all do together like walking, bike riding and working out.’ Now they have both reached their target, with Jayne having lost 5st 7lb going from a size 20 to a size 8 and Stephen having lost 13st. They now both enjoy a health balanced diet of lean meat and fish with fruit and vegetables. Jayne said: ‘ My husband looks amazing, we both feel fantastic. I feel like a very lucky woman. But even more than that, I’m delighted to have our old closeness back. ‘We’ve gone from dreading being together to loving our time together. Life has never been better. If we hadn't started the Cambridge Plan together I've no idea where we would be today . 'We have a lot to thank those little milkshakes for.' Jayne turned 40 in May feeling happier and fitter than ever and the former primary school teacher also secured her dream job teaching in a school for children with special needs. She said: ‘We are both so proud of each other and even the children tell us we look great. Losing the weight together has transformed life for the whole family.’ Stephen said: ‘ Because we are Catholic, divorce is not something we take lightly at all. I hoped it would never come to that but at times it was so bad it seemed like the only choice.’ But the happy couple now plan to mark both their 40th birthdays and their success on the scales with a wedding blessing later in the year. And they’ve also both trained as weight loss consultants to help other slimmers. Jayne said: ‘They say a joint hobby brings you closer together but I never thought that would be dieting. ‘I’ve got the body I’ve always dreamed of and my husband back. I wasn’t looking forward to turning 40 but I’ve never been happier. ‘Life really does begin at 40.’ Jayne’s start weight: 15st 7lbJayne’s weight now: 9st 13lbJayne’s dress size before: 20Jayne’s dress size now: 8 Stephen start weight: 27stStephen weight now: 13st 10lb .","Couple say busy lives saw their weight rise on diet of take aways .

"By . Jenny Hope . Landmark discovery: The brain of someone with MS, which can leave sufferers unable to walk - but new treatment could reverse the effects of the disease . A new treatment for Multiple Sclerosis not only stops the disease from advancing but may help patients recover from disability. Remarkable results for the drug alemtuzumab mean it has been approved for use on the NHS and is now available in England. Originally a pioneering cancer therapy, Cambridge University scientists have spent almost 25 years developing it as a treatment for MS sufferers. Trials involving more than 1,500 patients show treatment led to fewer relapses compared with multiple jabs of the treatment beta interferon each week, cutting further disability and even allowing some existing damage to recover. Alemtuzumab is given in two short courses with one infusion a day for five days during the first year and three days during the second year followed by regular monitoring. Despite the £56,000 price tag, the drug has got the go-ahead as cost-effective from the rationing watchdog the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (Nice). Professor Alastair Compston, Professor of Neurology and the Head of the Department of Clinical Neurosciences at the University of Cambridge, said the drug worked in the early stages of MS, but did not help patients with advanced disease. Multiple Sclerosis affects almost 100,000 Britons, causing attacks or relapses that may lead to progressive loss of physical skills, sensation, vision, bladder control, and intellectual abilities. About 2,500 people are diagnosed each year, with four out of five having relapsing-remitting MS - many of them in their 20s and 30s. Prof Compston said more than half of patients with this type of MS could benefit. He said ‘This is a real step forward and brings to a conclusion work involving a number of research groups in Cambridge, stretching back to 1991. ‘The decision from Nice now provides an opportunity for neurologists to offer a highly effective therapy for patients with multiple sclerosis early in the course of their illness.’ Alemtuzumab, marketed as Lemtrada by makers Genzyme, was being used in chronic lymphocytic leukaemia when Prof Compston identified its potential for treating MS. Patients take the treatment, which took 25 years to develop, in two doses over two years . It works by destroying a key class of immune cells that are attacking the body’ s healthy nerve cells and then rebooting the immune system so it no longer turns on itself. A main side effect is patients can develop other autoimmune diseases as the immune system gradually recovers following exposure to the drug. These include thyroid problems and a low blood platelet count that can rarely can prove fatal. Platelets are cells that circulate in the blood and clot to keep us from bleeding. The complications can be easily treated if promptly recognised which makes monthly blood tests essential, said Prof Compston. ‘This drug offers a bright future but it is coloured by the risk. ‘It’s not a cure and it doesn’t work for everyone but it can stabilise the disease for a long time. Patients are less disabled, they can look after their families and the societal savings are considerable’ he added. ‘This drug offers a bright future but it is coloured by the risk' - Professor Compston at University of Cambridge . Unlike most treatments newly approved for NHS use, patients don’t have to try other drugs first and more than two courses of treatment may be offered. Prof Compston said ‘Twenty years ago when a young person was diagnosed, I’d have to say I’m sorry to tell you that you do have MS – we’ll do our best to look after you but there are limited treatments. ‘Today this drug may well be suitable for 50 to 60 per cent of early cases.’ Nick Rijke, Director for Policy & Research at the MS Society, said it was ‘a major step forward’. He said ‘This drug has taken decades to develop, and we applaud the team at Cambridge for all their work in making it a reality. ‘While it’s not without risk, it’s proven to be a highly effective medicine for people with relapsing remitting MS and we look forward to seeing it made available to those who could benefit.’ Amy Bowen, of the MS Trust said ‘This provides people with MS with an important treatment option to consider in partnership with their MS specialists.’","Scientists have spent 25 years developing treatment at Cambridge .

"By . Jenny Hope Medical Correspondent . Life-saving: Diagnosis has improved vastly since 1994, according to the study . Tens of thousands of lives have been saved since the 1990s because patients with high blood pressure have been diagnosed and treated more effectively, researchers claim. A study found around 70,000 heart attacks and strokes were avoided in 2011, some of which would have been fatal. If the current rate of improvement continues, the annual number of cardiovascular events avoided will be 120,000 by 2022. Around 30 per cent of people in England have high blood pressure, the biggest risk factor for early death. But experts say increasing use of a wide range of effective drugs is paying off. Using data from five Health Survey for England polls from 1994 to 2011, experts analysed trends in blood pressure treatment. Professor Neil Poulter, one of the researchers from Imperial College London, said steady progress had resulted in around 70,000 cardiovascular events such as heart attacks and strokes being prevented in 2011. He added: ‘The 70,000 is an estimated one-year effect, whereby if 2011 practice had been applied in 1994 we estimate there would  have been about 70,000 fewer major cardiovascular events in 1994. ‘If we continue at the current linear rate of improvement, then by the year 2022 there’ll be about 50,000 fewer major events compared with 2011 as a result. ‘These estimates are the result of treating more people who need it, more effectively.’ High blood pressure, known as hypertension, is classified as more than 140/90 millimetres of mercury (mmHg). The first figure, systolic pressure, corresponds to the ‘surge’ of each heartbeat. The second, or diastolic, reading is the pressure during the rest between beats. Condition: High blood pressure, or hypertension, is classified as more than 140/90 millimetres of mercury . Hypertension patients are advised to eat less salt, lose weight, drink less alcohol, eat more fruit and vegetables and exercise more. Six million Britons take blood pressure drugs. The study found blood pressure steadily improved between 1994 and 2011, with the average systolic reading falling by 5mmHg in men and 9mmHg in women. Treatment rates doubled between 1994 and 2011, with 58 per cent of hypertensive adults receiving medication in 2011. Among those treated, the proportion of patients keeping blood pressure below 140/90mmHg almost doubled from 33 per cent in 1994 to 63 per cent in 2011. ‘Whereas once half the general . population with high blood pressure were diagnosed, half of those . detected treated, and half of those treated controlled, now management . in England is better than the rule of two-thirds' Study leader Emanuela Falaschetti . As a result, blood pressure levels have fallen 15mmHg since 1994 in adults receiving treatment, according to the study. The data, published in journal The Lancet, suggests many patients benefit from high doses of one drug, or two or three combined, and that some classes of drugs work better for certain age groups. Study leader Emanuela Falaschetti said there was ‘cause for optimism’. ‘Whereas once ... half the general population with high blood pressure were diagnosed, half of those detected treated, and half of those treated controlled, now management in England is better than the rule of two-thirds,’ she added. Richard McManus of Oxford University and Jonathan Mant of Cambridge University wrote in The Lancet: ‘After 50 years of treatment, it seems that the drugs are working.’ Like all drugs, the medication has side effects, including drowsiness, pain in the kidney area, a dry cough, light-headedness and a skin rash. But patients can be given an alternative if they have an adverse reaction. The Stroke Association’s Dr Shamim Quadir said the study showed ‘great progress’, but added: ‘The rates of diagnosis, treatment, and control of raised blood pressure in England are still too low compared with other countries, such as Canada.’","Treatment rates for hypertension have doubled between 1994 and 2011 .

"By . Jenny Hope . Cancer patients are being forced to wait too long for urgent treatment because the NHS is under ‘huge strain’, warn campaigners. Official figures show that waiting-time targets have been missed for the first time since they were introduced five years ago. The targets state that patients with cancer must not wait longer than two months from when their GP refers them urgently to a specialist to the start of their treatment. 'Huge strain' on the NHS means that cancer patients are having to wait too long for urgent treatments, campaigners have warned . For the first time since 2009 the overall target of 85 per cent of patients starting treatment within the 62 days has not been met. Department of Health figures show that in some hospitals only six in ten patients were seen within 62 days in the period from January to March. Sixty of approximately 180 hospital trusts in England failed to hit the 85 per cent target in the final quarter of 2013/14. The average slipped to 84.4 per cent during the period January to March, down from 85.8 per cent during the previous quarter. Figures were worse for patients with lung cancer, urological cancers and gastrointestinal cancers than for those with breast cancer or skin cancer. Mike Hobday, director of policy and research at the charity Macmillan Cancer Support, said: ‘It is of great concern that the number of trusts missing this target has doubled over the last year. Around one in four of the trusts that were hitting the target at the start of 2013/14 are now missing the target. ‘This is the first breach of any cancer waiting time in England since 2009 and is a clear warning sign that the NHS is under huge strain. ‘The UK already has some of the worst cancer survival rates in Europe. More patients are now facing delays, which means more patients are facing anxiety for longer and more lives are being put at risk. We’re very worried that the co-ordination of cancer care is getting worse and that cancer is being overlooked in the new NHS. The missed-target figures are worse for patients with lung cancer, . urological cancers and gastrointestinal cancers than for those with . breast cancer (pictured) or skin cancer . ‘The number of cancer patients is set to increase from two to three million by 2020. We can’t afford to see more and more people waiting longer.’ Sean Duffy, national clinical director for Cancer for NHS England, said work must be done to make sure standards are met. ‘Latest figures show nationally the NHS has met and exceeded seven out of eight cancer waiting time standards,’ he said. ‘But there is variation in meeting the challenging standards, and national performance against one of the targets has dipped. Commissioners are working with local providers where the standard is not being met to identify the issues to ensure patients are treated in a timely way.’ The Department of Health said: ‘The NHS is treating more cancer patients than ever. Since 2009, we’ve seen the number rise by 15 per cent. ‘We want the NHS to have the very best cancer services in the world, and are investing £750 million to support early diagnosis and access to treatment.’","NHS must treat 85% of cancer patients within 62 days of referral by GP .

"By . Jenny Hope . Brave stance: Angelina Jolie had both breasts removed last year after discovering she had an 87 per cent chance of contracting cancer . Women with breast cancer are increasingly asking for removal of both breasts – despite there being no medical reason for the surgery. Most do not have a genetic or family history putting them at higher risk of the disease, warn experts. As a result, they are being over-treated and may suffer long-term harm, including delays in dealing with the cancer. The rise in women asking for the procedure comes after actress Angelina Jolie last year chose a double mastectomy for prevention when she discovered gene mutations raised her risk of breast cancer to 87 per cent. The risk is around 12.5 per cent in the general population. But a recent study found more than two-thirds of women who had both breasts removed after a cancer diagnosis did not have a medical reason for doing so. They had a very low risk of developing cancer in the healthy breast because they had no family history of breast or ovarian cancer, or BRCA 1 or BRCA 2 gene mutations. The study was carried out by US researchers, but surgeons in Britain say such requests are on the increase, especially from young patients who want the unaffected breast removed at the same time. In the US study, of 1,447 women treated for breast cancer, almost 8 per cent had undergone a double mastectomy. But 69 per cent of these women who underwent removal of the unaffected breast at the same time had no genetic or family risk factors. Study leader Dr Sarah Hawley, from the University of Michigan, said having such a procedure ‘does not make sense’. ‘Having a non-affected breast removed will not reduce the risk of recurrence in the affected breast,’ she added. ‘For women who do not have a strong family history or a genetic finding, we would argue it’s probably not appropriate to get the unaffected breast removed.’ The research, published in the journal JAMA Surgery, found 18 per cent of the women studied had considered a double mastectomy. Women with a risky family history and BRCA mutations made up around 10 per cent of those diagnosed. In . the UK it is estimated that up to 1,200 women a year with faulty genes . have preventive removal of both breasts, while the number of breast . cancer patients opting for simultaneous removal of a second healthy . breast is unknown. Experts warn women are taking overly-drastic steps since Angelina Jolie went public with her procedure . Following Miss Jolie’s revelation last year that she had had a double mastectomy, a breast cancer charity reported a four-fold surge in women enquiring about having their breasts removed. Figures compiled by Cancer Research UK showed the number of calls to its helpline regarding a family history of breast cancer rose in 2013 from 13 in April to 88 for May. A total of 15,920 people went onto the pages from its website containing information about breast cancer the day of Miss Jolie’s announcement, May 14. The previous day just 4,796 visited the site. 'Women who do not have a genetic predisposition or family history are being over-treated' - Cancer surgeon Prof Kefah Mokbel . Leading breast cancer surgeon Professor Kefah Mokbel said in the past ten years there have been increasing requests for double mastectomies and reconstruction from young women diagnosed with cancer in one breast. He said: ‘They want to minimise the risk, but the study shows that women who do not have a genetic predisposition or family history are being over-treated.’ Genetic testing should be used as an objective measure for women considering having a second unaffected breast removed, he said. He warned that the procedure carries complications, such as potential psychosexual problems and possible delay in medical treatment of the affected breast, which could reduce chances of survival. Sally Greenbrook, of Breakthrough Breast Cancer, said: ‘Double mastectomies are not routinely offered to women with breast cancer in the UK unless they have a family history of the disease or a high risk of recurrence as outside of these groups there is no evidence to suggest that this would be of benefit.’ Baroness Delyth Morgan, chief executive of Breast Cancer Campaign, said: ‘Women who are concerned about getting breast cancer in their other breast should speak to their healthcare team who will be able to provide them with support and information about the risks of this occurring and their individual treatment options.’","Women with low risk of contracting cancer are requesting procedure .

"By . Pam Spurr . Dr Pam Spurr says that the majority of diets fail due to emotional niggles that trigger over-eating . If you're used to munching your way through a pack of biscuits because you're stressed, angry, or upset and you just want something to soothe you, you're in good company. Studies suggest 70 per cent of us go through phases of emotional eating. Not only does it leave you feeling guilty but emotional eating plays a large part in our falling off the diet-wagon. A major study into why 90 per cent of diets fail found the vast majority ditched their good intentions due to emotional issues and niggles. Although plenty of diets provide good nutritional information, if they don't address managing tricky emotions they're bound to fail. Picture this: you've stuck to correct portion sizes and healthy foods but had a long day, you're stuck in traffic, the children are fussing plus you have stacks to do. The delights of a slab of creamy chocolate play across your mind and you stop to buy a great big bar. Your temporary emotional relief evaporates almost instantly as you think 'there goes my diet.' In interviews for my new book The Emotional Eater's Diet I was struck how emotional eaters seem to fall into four 'profiles'. Identifying your profile is a first step towards . eating to fuel your energy needs and not to feed your emotional needs . Answer honestly to discover the profile you’re most . like: . Are you most likely to . emotionally eat when: . A Angry with someone else or myself . B When stressed and feel I can’t cope . C When feeling I’m not 'good enough'/self-doubt . D When I’m reminded of a painful experience/episode/event like divorce . If you’re feeling neglected or . undermined what’s your most likely reaction? A Inwardly I feel angry being treated like this . B I 'stress' over why they’re behaving that way . C It makes me struggle to feel good about anything the rest of the day . D I feel as I always feel – life’s tough for me . If you could change one . thing about your emotions what would you choose? A I'd stop feeling so much anger . B I'd sort out feeling so stressed . C I'd dump my feelings of insecurity . D I'd block out painful feelings from the past . Dr Pam Spurr says that in order to successfully lose weight we need to identify what kind of emotional eaters we are . What's your biggest fear when . you must face someone about an issue? A I won’t be able to control my temper . B I just keep worrying about how to do it . C I'll back down because I'm no good at conflict . D It'll be too painful to face them . When you emotionally eat what’s . most likely to go through your mind? A Angry feelings about being so weak . B If I wasn't so stressed I wouldn't be snacking . C How I'd love to have someone to lean on at that moment . D That I don't care about upsetting myself over potentially gaining weight . Make a note of how many As, Bs, Cs and Ds you chose. Check your relevant profile but it's extremely beneficial to look through all the profiles. Dr Pam Spurr says that emotional eating can be triggered by a number of different things. From stresses at work to feeling insecure, she says the biggest step to preventing it is identifying it . Mainly As: The Angry Eater Profile . Feeling angry towards others or situations, or turned in towards yourself, is probably key to your emotional eating. Try these: . Mainly Bs: The Stressed Eater Profile . Feeling unable to cope with stress is probably central to your emotional eating. Try these: . Mainly Cs: The Insecure Eater Profile . Dr Pam's book, The Emotional Eater's Diet gives details on how to combat emotional eating - for life! Feelings of insecurity and not being 'good enough' are likely to play a big part in your emotional eating. Try these: . Mainly Ds: The 'Emotionally Wounded' Eater Profile . Your answers suggest you've found it hard to heal past hurts and long-standing, unhappy feelings underlie your emotional eating. Try these: . Of course some people have a mix of answers and in this case it's helpful to look at all the advice for the four different profiles. Identifying your Emotional Eater Profile is one piece of the puzzle. In my book I cover many other key topics to overcoming your emotional eating including your personality traits, emotional life, upbringing, relationships, well-being, appetite control techniques, metabolism boosters and more.

To diet successfully we need to establish what emotions cause us to snack .
Take her quiz to discover what kind of emotional eater you are .
Accept you're entitled to your feelings and 'own' your anger. This anger tells you a situation needs to be sorted.
Record angry thoughts with a dictaphone/voice activated app. Listening back helps you understand these feelings, get them out of your system and choose an appropriate response.
Now plan steps towards changing/solving what angers you.
Challenge your negative belief system there's always someone/something to blame. The 'finger of blame' doesn't point to solutions!
Begin to take a 'stuff happens' attitude.
When angry 'think in ink', putting pen to paper, devise ways to approach the person you're upset with.
Devise your own motto like: I won't let anger eat me up because then I'll emotionally eat!
When angry and feeling the impulse to emotionally eat take a brisk five-minute walk - even if at work go back and forth briskly to the staff toilet. Remind yourself the issue you're angry about isn't worth it.
Start saying 'no' to extra responsibilities. By cutting responsibilities you give yourself a better chance of de-stressing.
Delegate as much as possible - many stressed-out people feel they have to do-it-all.
Challenge your stressy' thinking - is this something you really need to stress about? Could you face it in a calm manner?
Change your inner voice to one that repeatedly says it's going to be fine.
Emotional stress causes physical tension to build. Subconsciously you're aware of this physical tension which feeds your cycle of stress. So do regular stress-busting exercise plus calming meditation.
Oxytocin, the emotional bonding hormone, combats stress so get lots of hugs and physical affection from your partner, family, children, etc.
Let go and live a little as many stressed-out people forget having fun is a fantastic stress-antidote. Go to a comedy night, have a picnic, meet up with friends, etc.
Head off potential problems that cause you stress like allowing extra time to get out the door in the morning, to meet deadlines, etc.
When tempted to emotionally eat take five minutes to look through photos of your last relaxing holiday or fun time with family and friends to calm you.
Be aware of the emotionally draining 'disease-to-please' where insecurities mean you're always aiming to please others.
List your three best qualities where you can see them many times a day – focus on these.
Don't believe the myth that everyone else feels confident - many don't but they fake it to make it. 'Faking it to make it' can boost feelings of security.
Insecure people remind themselves of recent failures instead remind yourself of when you coped well with something.
Get more secure about expressing your feelings/beliefs/attitudes with the '3 Ps': plan what you want to say, Practice it so you feel confident, Put it into action.
Switch off your negative inner voice that says you're 'useless”, etc. Challenge it each time it starts.
Stop taking things personally like, e.g., your manager's criticism of a piece of work as about you as a person.
When tempted to emotionally eat ring that person who always makes you feel better about yourself for a reassuring chat.
If harbouring painful memories from past trauma or difficulties get professional help - it's never too late to start the healing process.
If you don't want formal help there are support groups for many different issues. You'll feel better knowing you've started this journey.
Dump the belief that you're not 'worth' the bother of professional help. You are!
Start believing that it's okay to open up to people you trust.
For some much of letting go of past pain is believing it's 'okay' to do so. Give yourself permission to say you can live life more happily from today.
Ring fence new issues that you will face more positively from today. Don't allow them to be clouded by negative feelings from your past.
When tempted to emotionally eat remind yourself you're getting stronger every day and make it your motto that your past won't dictate your present or future."

Men wanting to have children should stop smoking cannabis as it could have a serious impact on their fertility, the world's largest study of the effects of lifestyle on sperm suggests. The drug doubles the chances of men under the age of 30 . producing abnormal sperm - something that can have a serious impact on their chances of having children, according to the research. Experts from the universities of Sheffield and Manchester found that smoking cannabis was the only lifestyle choice to have a negative impact on sperm production - contradicting long-held beliefs that fertility is reduced by obesity, alcohol and tobacco consumption, and the wearing of tight underwear. Cut it out: Men wanting to have children should quit cannabis as it can have an impact on the size and shape of their sperm, potentially reducing fertility . The only lifestyle choice that had a major impact was smoking cannabis, which can reduce a man’s fertility by altering the size and shape of his sperm. A similar effect was discovered in the summer, although experts suggest it isn’t heat but probably the length of the day and hormonal changes that are responsible. When less than 4 per cent of a man’s sperm has a normal size and shape, statistics show he will find it harder to father a child and may need help from fertility techniques, including IVF. Teams from the universities of Sheffield and Manchester carried out the world’s largest study on the effects of lifestyle on sperm. Using data from  2,249 men attending fertility clinics around the UK, they compared the medical history and personal habits of 318 participants with less than 4 per cent of normal sperm and 1,652 whose sperm was of higher quality. Men in the first group were nearly twice as likely to have used cannabis in the three months before giving a sample, if they were aged under 30. They were also nearly twice as likely to have produced the sample in the summer months. Surprising: The study found that the seasons have an effect of sperm quality while other factors - such as alcohol and obesity - do not . The scientists believe younger men were most affected by cannabis simply because they were more likely to use greater quantities. Chemicals in the drug itself, not the tobacco used in ‘joints’, were probably responsible since cigarette smoking had little effect on sperm. One of the team leaders, Dr Allan Pacey, senior lecturer in andrology – the study of male health – at Sheffield University, said habitual cannabis users who wanted to become fathers should kick the habit for at least three months. ‘I can’t tell you definitively that your sperm will improve, but that’s a reasonable assumption,’ he said. He said the summer influence was surprising but it did not appear to be linked to heat or significantly alter seasonal conception patterns. ‘We didn’t expect this,’ he said. ‘It’s complete conjecture on my part, but it could be a sunlight effect. Day-length affects our hormones and  vitamin D in all sorts of ways.’ He added that men wanting to be fathers should not wait until winter. However, the study, published in the journal Human Reproduction, found that abstaining from sexual activity for more than six days improved sperm quality. It was possible that unmeasured factors, such as the quality of sperm DNA, influenced the results, said the researchers.","World's largest study on the effects of lifestyle on sperm has been published .

"By . Sophie Borland . Researchers from University College London and the University of Michigan say the over-50s would be better off avoiding insulin injections (file picture) Insulin injections may do more harm than good for some diabetes patients over the age of 50. Researchers say the benefits of the treatment can be outweighed by the daily disruption and side effects that include weight gain. Patients with type 2 diabetes should instead make simple lifestyle changes such as exercising and eating healthily. Around 2.9million Britons have this form of the disease, which is triggered by obesity. Some of these patients have to take insulin up to five times a day. It works by controlling the blood sugar and thereby preventing complications such as blindness, strokes and even amputations. But the researchers from University College London and the University of Michigan say the over-50s would be better off avoiding the injections and becoming more healthy. Their study, which is published in the Journal of the American Medical Association Internal Medicine, used a computer model and the findings of a UK study of 5,100 patients to calculate the benefits and risks of insulin injections. For the over-50s, the injections lowered the risk of suffering from kidney failure, heart disease, blindness or needing amputations by less than 0.01 per cent. There are no figures for exact numbers of type 2 diabetes patients using insulin but charities say it is in the order of hundreds of thousands. The jabs are administered between two and five times a day and a third of patients gain weight while others suffer headaches and flu-like symptoms. Lead author Sandeep Vijan, professor of internal medicine at the University of Michigan Medical School, said: 'For people with type 2 diabetes, the goal of managing blood sugar levels is to prevent associated diabetes complications, such as kidney, eye and heart disease, but it is essential to balance complication risks and treatment burdens when deciding how aggressively to treat blood sugars. 'If you're a patient with fairly low complication risks, but are experiencing symptoms from low blood sugar, gaining weight or find frequent insulin shots to be disruptive to your daily life, then the drugs are doing more harm than good. 'Prescribing medicine isn't just about reducing risks of complications, but also about helping patients improve their quality of life.' Patients with type 1 diabetes – usually diagnosed in childhood – have to take insulin otherwise their blood sugar would rise to a dangerously high levels. Their study used a computer model and the findings of a UK study of 5,100 patients to calculate the benefits and risks of insulin injections . And the researchers point out the injections still provide substantial benefits for younger patients with type 2 and for those who cannot control their blood sugar. Rodney Hayward, professor of medicine at the University of Michigan Medical School, said: 'Drugs that lower blood sugar levels are extremely beneficial in some patients but offer almost no benefit for others. 'These results have major implications for the millions of people who are currently being told they need to increase medication in order to achieve their glucose goal.' Simon O'Neill, director for health intelligence at the charity Diabetes UK, said: 'Clearly, everyone with type 1 diabetes needs to have insulin to stay alive. 'But for the treatment of type 2 diabetes, sometimes there is a balance to be struck where certain medications might help give someone a longer life but also cause side effects that might negatively impact on quality of life. 'This study highlights the importance of looking at the individual needs of the person with type 2 diabetes, rather than adopting a blanket approach. 'It also underlines how vital it is that healthcare professionals and people with diabetes work closely together to jointly decide what the best treatment options are for that person. 'Weighing up the potential benefits and side effects needs to be at the centre of that discussion.'","Researchers say patients should instead make simple lifestyle changes .

"By . Sarah Griffiths . New rules in the U.S. which come into force today will make it easier for people to donate their faces and hands in transplant operations. The policy will treat face, hand and limb transplants – known as vascularised composite allografts (VCAs) - like other organs that can be donated, to make life-changing procedures a viable option for more people. However, people carrying donor cards will not automatically be signed up. VCAs involve the transplantation of . multiple structures and can include skin, bone, muscles, blood vessels, . nerves and connective tissue. Warning: graphic content . More people are having face and hand transplants and now new rules in the U.S. are set to make the process slightly easier. Connie Culp survived a gun shot to her face (pictured left after initial surgery) and in 2008 had 80 per cent of her face transplanted (right) The Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network (OPTN), in Richmond, Virginia, which allocates organs in the U.S. has been struggling to allocate face and hand transplants because there has been no formal policy in place before now. Dr Sue McDiarmid, who chairs the organisation’s Vascularized Composite Allograft Transplantation Committee told ABC News that the rules should increase the number of procedures performed. ‘There are more of these procedures being done in the United States,’ she said. ‘[The new rules mean that] if there appears to be a potential donor that is interested or has stated ahead of time that they specifically would be interested in donating…we can go forward with that.’ Dr McDiarmid explained that a person or next of kin must give explicit consent that they want to donate their hands or face. Organ . donor registries are state-run, so different parts of the U.S, will . have different methods for securing the extra consent in the future. Dr Kenneth . Andreoni, President of OPTN, said: 'These policies establish the . framework for further development of this groundbreaking therapy, which . returns vital function and identity to people who have suffered a . devastating injury or illness.' 'We want to make this treatment more widely available while recognising the unique medical and ethical issues involved.' The first face transplant was performed in the U.S. in 2008 and the first hand transplant in 1999. Since then, seven people have received new faces, eight people two ‘new’ hands and 14 single hands. The new rules, which come into force today in the U.S. will treat face, hand and limb transplants like other organs that can be donated, to make life-changing procedures a viable option for more people. Here, a man recovers fro a face transplant in Poland, having lost most of his face to stone-cutting machinery . Under the new rules, a person or next of kin in the U.S. must give explicit consent that they want to donate their hands or face. This infographic details the procedure followed at a Polish hospital . Vascularised composite allografts (VCAs) including face transplants (pictured) involve the transplantation of multiple structures that may include skin, bone, muscles, blood vessels, nerves and connective tissue . Last year, surgeons in Poland carried out a total face transplant on a 33-year-old man whose face was torn off in an accident with stone-cutting machinery. Surgeons at the Oncology Centre in Gliwice said the 27-hour operation was performed just weeks after the accident. Previous transplants have taken months or years to prepare, but surgeons were able to reconstruct his face, jaws, palate and the bottom of his eye sockets. Just six days after the surgery, the man was able to give a thumbs up gesture from his hospital bed. Face transplant recipients include Charla Nash, whose face was mailed by a chimpanzee and Connie Culp, who survived a gunshot to her face in 2008 underwent a 22-hour procedure where 80 per cent of her face was transplanted. Carmen Blandin Tarleton whose husband attacked her with a caustic solution, blinding her and leaving her face unrecognisable, also had the procedure. Following her face transplant, she said: ‘The donor and her family have given me a tremendous gift making a significant difference in my quality of life at the daily level.’ As with any organ donations, the face and hands must be removed from a corpse immediately after death. Dr McDiarmid said that if the family of a donor wanted to have an open-casket funeral, a mould could be used to make a mask, or a prosthetic temporarily fitted.

"By . Claire Bates . A schoolboy given just a five per cent chance of survival after he was hit by a car and flung against a bus, has made a miracle recovery. Charlie Falcus, 12, was left with two skull fractures, a blood clot on the brain, fractured eye sockets, a broken collar bone and a laceration to his lung, following the road accident. He was rushed to the Royal Victoria Infirmary in Newcastle where his parents Sarah and Mark, 45, were told to brace themselves for the worst. But Charlie has battled back from the brink of death and amazed medics with his speedy recovery, spending just over a week in hospital following the accident. Write caption here . He has now been discharged and is recovering at his home in Newbiggin Hall, Newcastle. Mrs Falcus, said of her son: 'His life hung in the balance and if it wasn’t for the staff at the hospital we probably wouldn’t have had him here today. 'He’s our little miracle. At the hospital they put “Miracle Boy” on the front of his file. I just can’t believe he has pulled through. We really thought we were going to lose him. 'We’ve gone from critical to stable to having him home in a relatively short space of time.' Charlie had just stepped off a local bus after making his way home from Newcastle city centre with three friends. He walked around the front of the bus and stepped out into the path of a family car.He was flung back into the bus before landing on a nearby curb. Charlie with his relieved sister Maddie. The family don't know yet if Charlie will need further surgery . Luckily, several police officers saw the incident and rushed to his aid. Mrs Falcus, a personal assistant for Swinton Insurance, received a phone call from an officer to say her son had been involved in an accident. Charlie was taken to the RVI where he spent three days in the intensive care unit before being transferred to another ward. Mrs Falcus, 39, said: 'I just went from worrying about everyday things like what we were having for tea to thinking my whole world had fallen apart. It’s a mum’s worst nightmare getting that call.' Charlie said: 'I got off the bus and put my hood up. I must have looked and not seen anything and got hit. That’s all I can remember until I woke up in hospital. 'I couldn’t believe it. I was really shocked. I looked down and I saw my feet and they were cut and bruised. When I saw a picture of myself it was kind of weird.' Charlie, who loves playing football and rugby, spent his first day at home this week as he continues to recover. It is not known whether he may require surgery in the future. The family thanked everyone who supported them during Charlie's time in hospital. Sarah said: 'Everybody has been so lovely, from staff at the hospital to the local church, to Charlie’s school, friends and neighbours. Everybody has been asking after Charlie and I can’t thank them enough.' A Northumbria Police spokesman said: 'Officers were called at 4.43pm on November 10 to a crash at the junction with Etal Lane and Etal Way. 'The crash involved a Peugeot 207 and a pedestrian, a 12-year-old boy.

"By . Chloe Lambert . Did you have breakfast today? If not, you're putting yourself in grave danger - at least, that's according to a slew of recent reports which link skipping breakfast to obesity, diabetes and even catching flu. In the latest study, US researchers found men who don't have breakfast are 27 per cent more likely to suffer heart attacks or heart disease. The team at the Harvard School of Public Health said missing the meal put an 'extra strain' on the body. So is a morning meal really so crucial to health - and what's the healthiest thing to have? Breakfast blues: Men who don't eat the meal are 27% more likely to suffer heart attacks or heart disease . There is nothing magical about breakfast that makes it particularly important for health, says Dr Susan Jebb, head of diet and  population health at the Medical Research Council. 'I suspect you'd get the same risks - such as weight gain - with skipping lunch or dinner, but it's a less common behaviour, so people don't study it.' The pro-breakfast brigade would dispute this, pointing out that metabolic rate - the rate at which we burn calories - drops during sleep, and eating breakfast 'kick-starts' it again. Yet the evidence for this is not convincing, says Naveed Sattar, professor of metabolic medicine at Glasgow University. 'In trials like this recent one on heart disease, you have to ask - does skipping breakfast put you at risk of heart attack, or are people who skip breakfast simply more likely to have unhealthy characteristics and be disorganised and mindless about eating?' Blame your genes: If you struggle to eat in the hours after waking, it may have to do with your biological clock . If you struggle to eat in the hours after waking, it could be down to your biological clock, which is determined in part by your genes. Around 10 per cent of the population inherit genes that mean their clock is set a little slower, so they struggle to wake up in the morning, and this can affect appetite, says sleep expert Dr Neil Stanley. 'When we wake, a number of processes begin to get the body ready for daytime, including the release of hormones that make us feel hungry. 'But if you're an “owl” - who likes to stay up late but finds it hard to get up in the morning - you won't wake up feeling hungry, and the idea of breakfast will  be difficult. 'So don't force yourself to eat when you wake up at 7am. You'll probably find you start feeling hungry around 9am or 10am when you get to the office, so you could have something then.' However, Dr Stanley says irregular bedtimes can also  cause your clock to be out of sync, so try going to bed at the same time each night and you might start feeling hungry in the mornings. Some experts question the importance attached to eating breakfast above all other meals, but a number of studies have shown that doing so protects against obesity. This may not be because it's breakfast as such, but because it's one of three important daily meals. 'If you don't eat breakfast you'll be starving by mid-morning so you'll snack - then you won't eat a proper lunch and you'll be hungry again mid-afternoon and need to snack, and so on,' explains Jane Ogden, professor of health psychology at the University  of Surrey. Skipping breakfast can also influence the food choices we make throughout the day. Last year, a team at Imperial College London presented the results of a study involving 21 men and women, all around  the age of 25, who skipped breakfast one day but then had it the next. On the day they skipped breakfast, not only did they eat 20 per cent more at lunch, but they were more likely to seek unhealthier, high-calorie foods. The researchers scanned volunteers' brains while showing them pictures of food and found activity in the orbitofrontal cortex - which is linked to feelings of reward - was especially responsive to foods such as pizza and chocolate. Dr Tony Goldstone, who led the research, said humans were primed to seek sugary, fatty foods after a period of fasting. However, while people who skip breakfast are statistically more likely to be overweight, eating it won't necessarily help you shed pounds. In a recent study at the University of Missouri, a group of teenage girls who usually skipped breakfast were observed as they started eating breakfast over three weeks. Although they felt less hungry through the day and had lower levels of hormones such as ghrelin, which stimulates appetite, the girls ate more calories overall when they ate breakfast. Overweight: People who skip breakfast are more likely to pile on the pounds . Ever tuck into a hearty full English in the morning, believing you'll eat less for lunch? Stop fooling yourself. A 2011 study published in Nutrition Journal found people eat the same at lunch and dinner, regardless of what they have for breakfast. Dr Susan Jebb and her team at the Medical Research Council recently gave 33 overweight men and women breakfast three times - one contained around 700 calories, another was 20 per cent smaller and the third was almost half the size, at 300 calories. They found that the volunteers ate the same amount post breakfast each time. In other words, if you're trying to lose weight, a small 300 calorie breakfast should be enough to stop you overeating later. Examples of breakfasts that come in under 300 calories include a bowl of porridge with honey, a bowl of Special K cereal with milk, and a boiled egg with a slice of wholemeal toast. Dietitian Catherine Collins, who eats toast with spreadable butter and coffee for breakfast, offers a warning about seemingly-innocuous muesli. 'Be mindful of your portion,'  she says. 'As mueslis and granola take up less room in the bowl than flakes, it would be easy to pour yourself 50g - which is actually a lot of calories.' The worst ways to start the day include sugary cereals, pastries and white bread - which will cause a spike in blood sugar levels. If you have breakfast but nevertheless find your belly is rumbling again by 11am - and you're overweight - it could be a sign of insulin resistance, a precursor to diabetes, says Catherine Collins. Insulin converts sugar to energy in the body, but if your body has become resistant to the hormone, the insulin doesn't work as effectively, so the body has to produce even more. 'This means once the sugar from your breakfast has been metabolised there'll be a bit of insulin left hanging around, which keeps lowering your blood sugar, so you feel hungry again,' she says. 'If you're experiencing this and other symptoms of insulin resistance such as weight gain, especially around the middle, and feeling tired, see your doctor and make an effort to lose some weight, as this can stop it developing into full-blown diabetes.' Learn to love it: If you eat Weetabix for a while and expose your tastebuds to it, you'll start to enjoy it . Perhaps you'd love to start the day more healthily, but the idea of a bowl of Weetabix makes you want to stay under the duvet. David Katz, director of Yale University Prevention Research Center, has some advice: 'Tastebuds are malleable little fellows. 'If you soak them in sugary and salty foods, they'll lose their sensitivity to it and you'll start to need more all the time. Conversely, if you change your food choices, little by little you'll rehabilitate them and within weeks you'll start to love foods that love you back.' Professor Sattar backs him up. 'I used to love Frosties, until I discovered both my parents had diabetes and I had to change my diet. If you eat Weetabix for a while, and expose your tastebuds to it, you'll start to enjoy it.' The idea of many fasting diets such as the 5:2 plan - where you dramatically cut your calories for two days each week - is to find a routine that suits you. Dr Michael Mosley, author of The Fast Diet, says skipping breakfast is fine if that's what works for you. 'Some people on the diet do like to skip breakfast but I prefer to skip lunch so that I can eat in the mornings and evenings with my family.' A new fasting plan actually encourages you to skip breakfast. The Mini-Fast Diet, devised by Julian Whitaker, a U.S. physician, suggests fasting all morning and exercising before eating your first meal of the day at noon. You then eat sensibly for the rest of the day. The theory is because you only have to fast for a morning, and not a full day as you do on diets such as the 5:2, you'll find it easier to eat sensibly. Whitaker claims that in a trial of his diet, volunteers lost an average nine pounds after 12 weeks.","Men who don't eat breakfast are 27% more likely to suffer heart attacks .

"By . Sarah Griffiths . Bedridden in intensive care just weeks before her GCSE exams, Alicia Stevens's dreams of making it to the end of year school prom seemed impossible. The teenager had narrowly avoided death twice, having faced life-threatening illnesses. But the 16-year-old shocked the doctors and nurses caring for her, making a rapid recovery. And her miraculous turnaround came just in time to allow Alicia to join friends and classmates at the school dance. Alicia Stevens was in intensive care just weeks before her GCSE exams having spent time in hospital for a burst appendix (pictured left) but she managed to make a rapid recovery to attend her prom (pictured right) 'There were times that I was really scared in hospital and thought I would never make it to prom,' Alicia (far right) said. 'It was a dream come true to go to. I didn't even think about the past few months' Alicia fought for her life when she was struck down with suspected appendicitis on her 16th birthday (pictured left). She was admitted again (pictured right) when doctors found abscesses on her lungs, liver and kidneys . She danced . the night away, dressed in a floor length red gown, just eight weeks . after being in intensive care with pneumonia and abscesses on her . lungs, liver and kidneys. Alicia had already fought for her life when she was struck down with suspected appendicitis on her 16th birthday. Doctors told her she was lucky to be alive when they operated in February and found that her appendix had already burst. Alicia was hospitalised for nine days, before recovering at her home in Swaythling in Southampton, Hampshire. And she was back in hospital just a few weeks later when a cyst on her ovary burst. In May, the teenager was rushed to intensive care once more, after doctors found abscesses on her lungs, liver and kidneys. Alicia's mother Leeanne Hamerton (pictured) said: 'It was such an emotional day to see her there in her dress, looking so beautiful' Worryingly for her mother Leeanne . Hamerton, Alicia was also found to have pneumonia and fought for her . life while doctors tried to drain the abscesses. The teenager was weeks away from sitting her GCSE exams and when she woke up in intensive care, her first words were: ‘I’m going to fail my exams.’ With the help of her teacher Wendy Francis, Alicia sat her first exam 24 hours after having her drain removed and recovered in time for her prom. She now hopes to pass her photography exam to get into Southampton City College. ‘There were times that I was really scared in hospital and thought I would never make it to prom,’ Alicia said. ‘It was a dream come true to go to. It was amazing and I didn’t even think about the past few months, I just danced and had a good laugh with my friends.’ Her mother said: ‘I nearly lost her twice this year and there were times that I really didn’t think I would get to see that day. ‘She had been robbed of her 16th birthday so I wasn’t going to let her miss out on her prom. ‘It was such an emotional day to see her there in her dress, looking so beautiful having seen just how bad she had got. ‘It has been a horrendous year and now we are just hoping that the abscesses don’t return.’","Alicia Stevens, 16, went to her prom just eight weeks after being in intensive care with pneumonia and abscesses on her lungs, liver and kidneys .

"By . Angela Epstein . The right recipe: MAMIL Gordon Ramsay on a run . Struggling to fasten the buttons on a waistband, the glimpse of an emerging paunch, or a sudden realisation that climbing the stairs feels like taking on Everest - whatever the catalyst, an increasing number of flabby, fortysomething men are shaking off their sedentary lifestyles and embracing a programme of high-intensity exercise. Researchers Mintel found the biggest growth in bike sales in Britain was among men approaching middle age - more than half of men aged 35 to 44 have one. Known as MAMILs - Middle-Aged Men In Lycra - they exchange nights in front of the TV for frantic sessions on the treadmill in an attempt to get fit, lose weight and reduce the risk of a heart attack. Dr Glyn Thomas, a consultant cardiologist at the Bristol Heart Institute, says: 'Sometimes men in their 40s may find themselves having a routine medical or health check and will discover their blood pressure or cholesterol is on the high side. This acts as a wake-up call and they throw themselves into exercising and taking on challenges such as 5k or 10k runs.' However, an excessive, vigorous and unsupervised exercise routine might not be as healthy as it seems. Emerging science suggests there is a threshold of distance, intensity or duration for even the hardiest fitness fanatic, and overshooting this can have a serious impact, particularly on cardiovascular health. A study presented at the American Academy of Family Physicians found middle-aged men who run marathons are at significantly greater risk of cardiac arrest. This was tragically highlighted by the death of Michael McErlain, a 45-year-old Army surgeon, as he competed in a 44-mile charity D-Day run along the Normandy beaches in France last June. The seemingly super-fit Lieutenant-Colonel, from Hindhead, Surrey, died from undiagnosed heart disease. So why does intense exercise put even fit men at risk? As we get older the efficiency with which the heart pumps blood round the body and the way both the heart and the muscles use oxygen in the blood changes and becomes less efficient, says Eddie Chaloner, a consultant vascular surgeon at Lewisham Hospital, South-East London. 'The arteries start to fur up and narrow as part of the ageing process,' he adds. Undertaking vigorous exercise without building it up in a calm fashion can cause a dramatic rise in blood pressure, leading to an imbalance between the demand of the heart muscle for oxygen and the ability of the coronary arteries to supply it. All of which could trigger a heart attack, says Dr Thomas. 'I see a lot of middle-aged men in my clinic who have taken up excessive exercise because they have hit 40,' he adds. 'They have panicked because they have put on weight or got high blood pressure and may have been referred to me for further investigations. 'But people don't realise that, aside from the risk of a heart attack, taking up exercise this way can actually lead to heart problems. Excessive exercise in middle-aged men can trigger atrial fibrillation - a heart condition that causes an irregular and often abnormally fast heart rate. Greater risk: Middle-aged men who run extensively (like actor Hugh Jackman, pictured) are significantly more likely to suffer cardiac arrest . 'One in five strokes is caused by this - and the kind of stroke caused by atrial fibrillation is more likely to be fatal.' In a review published in the journal Heart, two leading U.S. cardiologists looked at the heart health of 50,000 people over 30 and found that the 14,000 runners in the study were likely to live longer than non-exercisers, but only if they ran between five and 20 miles a week, not more. The cardiologists concluded that exercising intensely for more than an hour or two may damage the heart, causing its tissue to stretch, tear and scar and raising the odds of dangerous changes in heart rhythm. Taking up intensive exercise can also have an effect on joints, says Professor Tony Kochhar, consultant orthopaedic surgeon at South London Healthcare NHS Trust and BMI The Sloane Hospital. 'Cycling, for example, can be a particular problem for the hips,' he says. 'The body is no longer designed to deliver the way it could in our youth, so we have to adapt.' There's no doubt the right level of exercise for middle-aged men is hugely beneficial for health - in terms of heart muscle strength, blood pressure and circulation. By the time they hit their 40s, men start to lose muscle and gain fat. Meanwhile, loss of muscle and bone density, caused by dropping levels of the male hormone testosterone, can make muscles and ligaments stiff and tight, and more prone to injury. Hugh Montgomery, professor of intensive care medicine and director of the Institute for Human Health and Performance at University College, London, says: 'Exercise can help reduce the risk of so many health conditions from obesity and depression to diabetes and bowel cancer - which is the second most likely disease after heart disease to kill middle-aged men.' Exercising at this life stage can also give a man's sex life a boost. A Dublin study of 900 men in their 50s found those who shed their spare tyres through exercise had a higher sperm count and stronger erections, as exercise prevents levels of the male sex  hormone testosterone from dropping. Meanwhile, a study by the University of Montreal of overweight middle-aged men who exercised regularly for just a few months found that as their waists shrunk, their mental agility grew. This was thought to be down to exercise improving arterial health, making the body more efficient at using oxygen pumped in the blood to the brain. So how should a middle-aged man go about exercising safely? It's advisable to find out  if you are already at an increased risk of heart disease through diabetes or high blood pressure - both of which can be assessed through blood tests organised by your GP. Tell your doctor of any family history of heart disease and stroke. It's then important to start by spending several weeks simply becoming more active during the day, perhaps by using the stairs or walking to the shops, says John Dearing, a sports injury surgeon at Carrick Glen Hospital in Ayr. After that, build up your fitness level slowly, perhaps walking 20 to 40 minutes, three times a week. 'You should walk, cycle or whatever you choose to do with enough exertion to become mildly breathless, but you should still be able to talk in sentences,' adds Professor Montgomery. 41% of men who exercise have had to quit due to an injury . It's not just your heart you need to protect. Warming up is very important to avoid muscle strain - this should take up about 10 per cent of the time of your session, says John Miles, the medical head at Cardiff Blues rugby club. This could include basic movements such as lunges, squats and stretches for the lower limb muscles. Once you feel as if fitness has improved, and you want to start speeding up then do this gradually. Dr Dearing adds: 'If you take up, say, jogging, start by doing ten to 15 minutes. If you manage that without a problem, then do 20 minutes the following day.' Establish distance before you think about speed. Once you can jog a mile-and-a-half, you can vary your run with ten seconds of sprinting, followed by slowing down for a minute and then repeating three times - a system known as Fartlek training (from the Swedish for 'speed play', it means varying exercise with periods of intensity). It's important to keep note of any symptoms that could suggest a strain on your cardiovascular system. Dr Thomas warns: 'If you have any chest pain or discomfort when exercising, you must get it checked out. 'Heart pain occurs as a crushing pain across the chest, not just on the left side as people mistakenly think. Nausea and breathlessness when exercising can also be a sign of heart issues.' Unfortunately, there is no cast-iron guarantee that your heart will be fine. But as Dr Dearing points out: 'Increasing physical activity has huge benefits - and some exercise is always better than none. 'But take a sensible approach, otherwise you run the risk of doing more harm than good.'","MAMILs (Middle-Aged Men In Lycra) are on the rise .

"By . Karen Evennett . Kitty Buchanan-Gregory had repeated episodes of feeling dizzy and sometimes passing out . When Kitty Buchanan-Gregory saw her GP about dizzy spells, she could tell she wasn't being taken seriously - and she could understand why. 'I was 30, didn't smoke, ate healthily, drank little and trained with my rowing club five times a week,' says Kitty, now 39, a business project manager from Battersea, South London. 'I could see the doctor mentally giving me the all-clear before even checking my pulse and blood pressure, which both proved normal.' Kitty had suffered from sporadic dizzy spells since childhood, but over the years they gradually became more frequent and frightening, and by the time she saw her GP, she had them most days - sometimes several times a day. 'If I was walking and couldn't hold on to something when one of these attacks happened, I'd fall, but mostly it happened when I was sitting. All of a sudden I felt I was swirling under water and drowning, and needed to focus on not being sick. 'Then, within no more than ten seconds, I'd jolt back to normal, so people never noticed. Because I seemed healthy, the GP concluded it was stress from work. But I was convinced something was wrong.' The dizzy spells continued and, over the next three years, Kitty returned to her GP practice four times, seeing different doctors, who agreed it was probably stress. At this time she was so desperate for an answer, she had a private medical screening through work. 'It included an ECG (electrocardiogram) that measured electrical activity in my heart for a minute or two. But the doctor said I was one of the fittest people he'd seen. So I decided to try not to let my dizzy spells bother me.' But two years later, in January 2009, Kitty lost consciousness - coming round in a pool of blood in her bathroom. 'I must have fallen backwards on to the door catch, leaving a 7in gash in my back, then gone forward, hitting my head on the bath. I was very shaken and worried about collapsing again.'She returned to her GP a few days later asking for another ECG, and the doctor reluctantly referred her for one at St  Thomas' Hospital, London. There she was fitted with a 24-hour ECG monitor. 'Frustratingly, I didn't have a dizzy spell that day,' says Kitty. 'I wanted something to show up because I was sure I had a heart condition.' On the morning she returned the monitor, the hospital called and asked her to go straight to A&E where she was admitted immediately. A cardiologist explained that during the 24-hour test - even without having a dizzy spell - her heart had paused 60 times. Kitty had a 'heart block', a condition common in elderly people, and a natural result of ageing, but which can occur in the young, too. 'It's a problem with the wiring of the heart,' explains Professor Peter Weissberg, medical director of the British Heart Foundation and former professor of cardiovascular medicine at Cambridge University. 'A normal heartbeat is initiated by an electrical signal from the heart's natural pacemaker, the sinoatrial node in the right upper chamber of the heart. One in five Britons has had to have stronger medication because they put off seeing their doctor about worrying symptoms, a survey for the Information Standard found. 'With heart block - also called atrioventricular block or AV block - the signals are partially or totally blocked between the upper chambers [atria] and lower chambers [ventricles], which pump blood around the body. This is because the wiring either conducts the impulse abnormally slowly, or the wiring is broken, so the impulse doesn't get through at all. 'The heartbeat can become extremely slow, pausing occasionally - causing dizziness - but then restarts as other pacemaker cells in the heart take over.' So why did Kitty's diagnosis take so long? Most GPs see thousands of patients suffering with dizzy spells, usually with no major underlying cause - which means they may not think that something serious is causing them. While a standard ECG is a cheap and easy way to diagnose heart conditions such as heart failure or valve disease, it won't detect heart rhythm problems if they are intermittent and do not occur during the reading - that requires continuous ECG monitoring for days. There are different types of heart block. First and second-degree heart block - both affecting one in 50 otherwise healthy adults - occur when electrical impulses are slow or fail to reach the ventricles, potentially causing dizziness. Third-degree heart block, or complete heart block, which Kitty has, is when no electrical impulses from the upper chambers of the heart reach the pumping chambers. Instead, the heart keeps beating only thanks to cells in the ventricles stimulating a heartbeat - but because this kind of heartbeat has an extremely low rate, it can affect blood flow, leading to a raised risk of fatigue, dizziness, light-headedness, blackouts and cardiac arrest. Kitty had a 'heart block', a condition common in elderly people, and a natural result of ageing, but which can occur in the young, too . Heart block can occur from birth or be acquired. Ironically, athletes may be at greater risk. As Professor Weissberg explains: 'Heart rate is controlled by the vagus nerve, running from the base of the brain to the abdomen, which transmits signals through the body. It acts as a natural brake on the heart's pacemaker cells, particularly when we're at rest or asleep. 'The more physically fit a person, the higher their “vagal tone”, which means it acts even more as a brake, lowering  heart rate so the  electrical impulses are slow.' Other causes of first and second-degree heart block include inflammation of the heart muscle (myocarditis - usually caused by a virus), or low levels of potassium or magnesium in the blood, caused by extreme dieting, kidney conditions, damage from heart attack and Lyme disease (a bacterial infection spread by ticks).Some heart and blood-pressure medicines - including calcium channel blockers and digoxin - can also delay electrical signals passing through the atrioventricular node (which electrically connects the upper and lower chambers of the heart). Third-degree heart block is normally caused by heart damage as a result of heart surgery, coronary heart disease, trauma, infection or radiotherapy. Up to 10 per cent of over-70s with a history of heart disease develop complete heart block. Often, first and second-degree heart block patients are not treated and only monitored if they have no symptoms and no cause, such as medications, can be found. For other heart blocks, pacemakers, which stimulate heartbeat  by firing electrical impulses,  are advised. It's thought Kitty's heart block was caused by an underlying problem, probably from birth. 'It's likely it was exacerbated by her extreme fitness,' adds Professor Jaswinder Gill, consultant cardiologist at Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust. 'You cannot predict when a long, life-threatening pause may occur in patients, so it's vital a pacemaker is fitted quickly.' Kitty had hers implanted in January 2009. 'Getting used it wore me out. I was worried for the first six weeks, when muscles need to grow around it to avoid the  risk of pulling the wires out -  this can happen with awkward movements.' Because of this risk, she's had to stop rowing. The good news is she hasn't had any dizzy spells since. 'After my diagnosis, my GP half-heartedly apologised, but said: “We're not trained to look for people like you.” I could have been angry, but instead feel lucky to have a  second chance.'

"By . Lizzie Parry . A new drug which boosts the immune system could provide a breakthrough in the treatment of obesity and related illnesses . A new drug which boosts the body's immune system could provide a breakthrough in the treatment of illnesses linked to obesity. Spiraling obesity rates have resulted in alarming rates of diabetes, heart disease and cancer. Scientists are hopeful that in the next two years a new jab could be available to tackle obesity -  and in turn slash the associated health risks. A new study carried out at Havard Medical School and the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in the U.S. has identified a new hormone, irisin, which increases in the body during exercise, boosting energy and controlling blood glucose levels. Researcher Professor Bruce Spiegelman said activating the body's immune system could treat obesity and diabetes. He told the Express: 'This research reveals an exciting new class of potential treatments that could be used for obesity-related disorders.' The body produces 'healthy' brown fat, which is turned on or activated when a person is cold to help maintain body heat by burning stored calories. Studies have found exercise can stimulate hormones that activate brown fat. The new research focused on a protein found to stimulate the secretion of the hormone irisin. Prof Spiegelman said harnessing irisin could help scientists develop better therapies for any illness that can be controlled by exercise. The breakthrough marks an important first step in understanding the biological mechanisms that translate physical exercise into beneficial changes throughout the body, both in healthy people and in preventing or treating disease. Experiments found irisin helps convert 'bad' white fat - which accumulates around a person's middle - into 'healthy' brown fat, which increases energy expenditure and improves resistance to obesity linked diabetes. Prof Spiegelman said: 'There has been a feeling in the field that exercise ‘talks to’ various tissues in the body. But the question has been, how?' The report said the irisin hormone has direct and 'powerful effects' on adipose or fatty tissue - deposits of white fat that store excess calories, which contribute to obesity. When irisin levels rise during exercise - or when injected directly into mice - it switches on genes that convert white fat into brown fat. In the wake of findings by Prof Spiegelman and others, there has been a surge of interest in the therapeutic possibilities of increasing brown fat in adults. Along with stimulating brown fat development, irisin was shown to improve glucose tolerance, a key measure of metabolic health, in mice fed a high fat diet. Prof Spiegelman warned the discovery will not allow people to skip the gym and build muscles by taking irisin supplements, because the hormone does not appear to make muscles stronger. The study showed irisin levels increase as a result of repeated bouts of prolonged exercise, but not during short-term muscle activity. Scientists from Havard Medical School and the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute say a new hormone identified during their study could prove the breakthrough in the treatment of conditions including diabetes . To test whether increasing irisin alone could mimic exercise benefits, the scientists injected modest amounts into sedentary mice that were obese and pre-diabetic. With just 10 days of treatment, the mice had better control of blood sugar and insulin levels - in effect, preventing the onset of diabetes - and lost a small amount of weight. Although the weight loss was small, Prof Spiegelman said the hormone may have a greater effect when given for longer periods. Prof Spiegelman said: 'Whether longer treatments with irisin and/or higher doses would cause more weight loss remains to be determined. 'The worldwide, explosive increase in obesity and diabetes renders attractive the therapeutic potential of irisin in these and related disorders.' He added: 'Another potentially important aspect of this work relates to other beneficial effects of exercise, especially in some diseases for which no effective treatments exist. 'The clinical data linking exercise with health benefits in many other diseases suggests that irisin could also have significant effects in these disorders.' His colleague Dr Pontus Bostrom said: 'It is s exciting to find a natural substance connected to exercise that has such clear therapeutic potential.' Prof Spiegelman said it should be possible to move an irisin-based drug rapidly into clinical testing, possibly within two years, because it is a natural substance that is identical in mice and humans .","Study by scientists in the U.S. identified new hormone - irisin, which increases in the body during exercise .

"By . Anna Hodgekiss . A Canadian man is suing a hospital over surgery he claims left his penis one inch shorter - and ruined his marriage. The unnamed man - who is also paraplegic - was rushed to hospital in 2011 with a fractured appendage. This was an injury sustained while . having sex with his wife, according to the lawsuit filed last week. The Canadian patient had needed surgery after fracturing his penis during sex (file picture) A fracture can occur when there is . trauma to the erect penis. If it is bent suddenly or forcefully while . engorged, the trauma may rupture the lining of one of the two cylinders . in the penis (corpus cavernosum) responsible for erections. The injury is often accompanied by an audible cracking sound, then dark bruising as blood escapes from the cylinder. This patient underwent surgery to try and repair the damage, but this reportedly left a 'permanent scar' on his penis - and reduced its length by 'about . an inch' (2.5cm). The man, from Montreal, claims he was unable to have sex for two years and his wife eventually left him. He is now seeking Can$155,000 ($142,680 / £84,073) in damages for negligence and 'indescribable anguish', the Canadian agency QMI reports. He told staff there: 'This has caused a greater impact on my life than when I lost the use of my legs.' The lawsuit claims that after arriving at hospital, a nurse assessed the injury without performing a physical examination. The patient underwent surgery to try and repair the damage, but this reportedly left a 'permanent scar' on his penis - and reduced its length by 'about an inch' (2.5cm) An off-site urologist then diagnosed him with 'mild trauma' to the area and he was sent home - again without being examined, it is claimed. It was only three months later - when he still couldn't have sex - that he was told he had a fractured penis and would require surgery. But after the operation, he says he was left with a 'permanent scar' on his manhood. The lawsuit also claims he had lost 'about an inch' of length - and was unable to have sex for two years, leading to the breakdown of his marriage.","Unnamed Canadian man was rushed to hospital with a fracture to the area .

"By . Anna Hodgekiss . A man who was so fat he had to use a seat belt designed for pregnant women on an aeroplane has lost 17 stone. David Hudson, 43, steadily crept up to 34 stone after years of late night fast food, pies, pasties and binge drinking. He was so overweight he had already been approved for gastric band surgery. Success: David Hudson, 43, lost 17st after the humilation of needing a pregnant woman's seat belt on a flight . But after the mortifying incident on a flight to Turkey in 2010 - and bumping into an old friend who had just lost weight - he decided to try and shed the pounds himself. He has now reached his target weight of 17 stone and at 6ft 8ins, his GP has deemed him fit and healthy for a man of his age. Mr Hudson, a CCTV engineer who lives in Wallsend, North Tyneside, said: 'I bumped into a friend in a supermarket who had lost a lot of weight and I thought if he can do it - so can I.' His work shift patterns, and his wife Alison’s late nights managing a pub, meant that the couple often didn't eat until midnight or 1am. He said: 'I was just eating daft rubbish and slowly the weight crept on. On a flight to Turkey the stewardess gave me a seatbelt for a pregnant woman and I got wedged in the seat so there was no leg room for the guy behind me. Transformed: Mr Hudson and his wife Alison. Because of their shift patterns, they piled on the pounds eating late at night. They now eat healthier meals . 'That was the worst. You are aware of looks and you are aware that even though people politely say nothing, you can see them looking at you out the corner of your eye.' In his 20s, Mr Hudon had been a keen runner - but over the years had piled on the pounds. 'I was a runner and people used called me Rodney Trotter I was so lanky, but by my late 20s I was starting to put on weight.' By  the time he started dieting in 2010, he was 34 stone. After losing five stone by himself, over seven months, he felt he had hit a brick wall. Determined to keep going, last year he signed up to a Slimming World class, regularly losing half a stone a week.  Over eight months, he lost 10 stone. Joint effort: Mr Hudson's success also inspired his wife Alison to join the group  - she has lost 2st . He also learned how to cook meals from scratch, was given healthy recipes to try and has become a regular at the gym - going up to 12 times a week. Mr Hudson said: 'The first time I did three minutes . on the treadmill I thought I was going to die. But I went back the next . day and did 10 minutes and now I can do an hour’s cardio session. Over 36 weeks he lost more than 10 stone and now weighs 17st 10lb. His Slimming World leader has declared it is the highest weight loss she has ever seen. Mr Hudson's success also inspired his wife Alison to join the group. She has now lost two stone, going from 11 st 8lb to 9st 4lb. He said: 'The Slimming World sessions were just the focus I needed each week to keep the number on the scales going down.'","David Hudson, 43, binged late at night on takeways, pies and alcohol .

"By . Anna Hodgekiss . E-cigarettes must be subject to much more stringent controls to ensure they are safe, leading health experts have warned. More than 100 of them have sent an open letter to the  World Health Organization, outlining their concerns about what unregulated products may contain. They fear manufacturers of electronic nicotine devices are 'making false and unproven claims, misleading the public into thinking these products are harmless (they are not) and effective cessation aids (which is unknown)'. Manufacturers of e-cigarettes are 'making false and unproven claims, misleading the public into thinking these products are harmless, health experts have warned . The letter, to WHO director general Margaret Chan, is in response to one sent last month by 53 other experts. It was written after information was apparently leaked that the WHO wanted to class e-cigarettes as a tobacco product because they were a 'threat'. In the letter, the experts argued that e-cigarettes could be among the most significant health . innovations of the 21st century and could save millions of lives . Another new study published in a special supplement of Tobacco Control, . found that the market of e-cigarettes is growing rapidly. Researchers . from the U.S. sought to identify the number of these products available . online. They did two separate internet searches of English language . websites, the first between May and August in 2012 and the second . between December 2013 and January 2014. In the period between searches there was a net increase of 10.5 new brands and 242 new flavours every month, they said. By January 2014, they identified 466 brands with 7,764 unique flavours. As a result, they stated they should not be classed as a tobacco product, which would restrict their access - and have huge consequences on public health. But the latest letter, organised by tobacco scientist Stanton Glantz of the University of California, San Francisco, urges the opposite - and calls for more rigorous investigation into the devices. The group of 129 experts from 31 countries wrote: 'By moving to the e-cigarette market, . the tobacco industry is only maintaining its predatory practices and . increasing profits. 'The aggressive marketing and promotion of . e-cigarettes to youth is well documented and evidence shows rapid growth . in youth e-cigarette use, including disturbing rates among youth who . have never smoked a cigarette. 'From a population perspective it is important to know what new risks a consumer product may introduce to the market.' E-cigarettes use battery-powered cartridges to produce a nicotine hit . via inhalable vapor without the tar and other carcinogens in inhaled . tobacco smoke. The latest letter says manufacturers should be required to present data that show the products are safe and help smokers quit, and disclose ingredients in the 'vaping' liquid the devices burn. Regulating e-cigarettes like tobacco products, the signatories wrote, is necessary to prevent young people from starting to use them, protect bystanders in public areas from involuntary exposure, regulate marketing, and ban unsubstantiated claims. Figures show that e-cigarettes are most commonly used by ex-smokers - often as away of giving up or cutting down on regular cigarettes . They add that  although e-cigarette vapor has fewer toxic components than regular smoke, more than half a dozen studies have shown it can include ultrafine particles damaging to lungs, plus 'carcinogens and reproductive toxins, including benzene, lead, nickel, and others'. The WHO is assessing its position on e-cigarettes, and has indicated it is leaning toward restrictions like those on all nicotine-containing products, including banning advertising and flavours. The call comes as new research showed that almost 30 million people around Europe have tried the battery operated nicotine products. A new study published in the journal Tobacco Control Found that 20.3 per cent of current smokers, 4.7 per cent of ex-smokers and 1.2 per cent of people who had never smoked had tried an e-cigarette at least once. The researchers, from  Imperial College London, the US and Greece, say that when the figures are . extrapolated, this means 29.3 million European adults have tried . the products. But they added the scientific community is yet to provide information regarding the harm or efficacy of e-cigarettes.

"By . Sophie Borland, Health Correspondent . Study: Researchers claim red meat can increase the risk of breast cancer (file photo) Women who eat red meat frequently are at far higher risk of breast cancer, a major study has revealed. Just one and a half portions a day – the equivalent of three slices of bacon – may raise the chance of developing the disease by more than 20 per cent. By contrast, swapping a serving of red meat for chicken, fish, pulses or vegetables can reduce the risk by up to 25 per cent, researchers claimed. Breast cancer is by far the most common form of the illness in women, and statistics show one in eight will develop it. There is growing evidence that it is linked to lifestyle factors – with obesity, smoking, excess alcohol and a lack of exercise thought to increase the risk. In a study published today in the British Medical Journal, US researchers looked at the diets of 88,803 women aged 26 to 45. They tracked them for 20 years, from 1991 to 2011, and monitored how many contracted breast cancer in that time. Those who ate one and a half portions of red meat a day were 22 per cent more likely to have developed the illness compared to those who had none or very little. One portion is about 2oz (55g), the equivalent of a small steak, a chop, two slices of bacon, a serving of mince or several slices of ham. The researchers also said every extra serving of red meat consumed daily increased a woman’s risk of breast cancer by 13 per cent. Swapping one portion of red meat for chicken or turkey each day reduced the likelihood of the illness by a quarter, while switching it with poultry, fish, vegetables or pulses brought it down by 14 per cent. Experts believe saturated fat in red . meat increases cholesterol levels, which in turn trigger the production . of the hormone oestrogen, which is linked to breast cancer. Lead . author Dr Maryam Farvid, of the Harvard School of Public Health in . Boston, concluded that higher red meat intake in early adulthood ‘may be . a risk factor for breast cancer’. She added: ‘Replacing red meat with a combination of legumes, poultry, nuts and fish may reduce the risk of breast cancer.’ But British scientists played down her findings yesterday. They said most other studies have not shown any link between breast cancer and red meat. Professor Valerie Beral, director of the Cancer Epidemiology Unit at the University of Oxford, said: ‘The available evidence indicates that red meat consumption has little or no effect on breast cancer risk, so results from a single study cannot be considered in isolation. 'This study alone is not strong enough to . change the existing evidence that has found no definite link... [But] it’s not a bad idea to swap some red meat for white meat, beans or fish' Professor Tim Key, Cancer Research UK . ‘The most reliable measure of meat consumption is whether or not people are vegetarian. Vegetarians do not have lower risks of breast cancer than non-vegetarians, supporting other evidence that meat consumption is unlikely to play a major role in breast cancer.’ Professor Tim Key, of Cancer Research UK, said: ‘This research finds only a weak link between eating red meat and breast cancer and this study alone is not strong enough to change the existing evidence that has found no definite link between the two. It’s not a bad idea to swap some red meat – which is linked to bowel cancer – for white meat, beans or fish.’ In 2011, the Government issued advice urging the public to cut its red meat intake to no more than 500g a week over concerns that it caused bowel cancer and increased the risk of heart disease. Some 50,000 cases of breast cancer are diagnosed in the UK every year, with almost 12,000 patients dying from it annually. These rates have increased by 70 per cent since the Seventies, possibly due to increased obesity and alcohol consumption, and a rising elderly population, who are at greater risk.","U.S. researchers studied the diets of almost 90,000 women aged 26 to 45 .

The Little Paris Kitchen chef today unveiled the world's first patisserie where everything is cooked using steam. The Steam Patisserie has opened as a pop-up on London's Regent Street and Rachel Khoo, 33, kicked off proceedings with a demonstration of some of her famous Parisian cooking using the steam ovens. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Rachel Khoo helped to launch the world's first Steam Patisserie on London's Regent Street today . The ovens come from high-end appliance maker Miele and allow cooks to achieve a professional level of cooking in their own home with a combination of a conventional fan oven and steam. Rachel cooked an appetising array of cakes including brioche buns, fruit tartlets and chocolate sponge in order to display the diversity of cooking with steam. By using steam cooks can avoid using cooking oil or fat resulting in a much lighter, healthier treat. Rachel's steam creations included brioche buns, fruit tartlets and chocolate sponge . Despite the lower fat content, Rachel insists that flavour isn't compromised and that steam can actually produce a better bake . The ovens are also designed to retain the food's natural nutrients, vitamins and minerals. Often lighter treats can mean tasteless results but Rachel is keen to stress that no flavour is lost - and, if anything, the steam can improve the taste of a cake. 'Steam ovens are perfect for delicious patisseries and breads - anything where 'rise' is important. 'The moisture injection function helps not only to create lift and rise, but also produces a lovely thin, light crust together with the lightest pastry imaginable.' Dominic Worsley the marketing director at Miele, believes that cooking with steam is a real innovation. Free patisseries will be available in store between 2-4 July . 'Steam Patisserie demonstrates the amazing things that combining steam with heat can achieve in your own home. 'Steam is a powerful tool in the kitchen and it's not just for cooking your vegetables. There's virtually no limit to what can be cooked in a combination steam oven.' He also agrees that steam can help to produce some of the best baking results possible. 'For baking we firmly believe it's the appliance which will give you the best possible results, from the airiest brioche to a perfectly glossy crust on sourdough bread. 'It doesn't just lock in moisture for incredible texture, but also helps to give pastry the best possible crust. 'This is something that has never been done before, so we can't wait to hear what people think.' Free pastries will be available at the Steam Patisserie on London's Regents Street from July 2-4.","The Steam Patisserie opens today on London's Regent Street .

"By . Anna Hodgekiss . The number of district nurses has dropped by 50 per cent in the last ten years and they will be ‘extinct’ by 2025, it has been claimed. The Royal College of Nursing has highlighted NHS figures showing there are now 6,656 in post compared to 12,620 in 2003. The union also warns that three-quarters of the remaining district nurses are so overworked they do not have time to properly talk to patients. Endangered: District nurses may be extinct by 2025 unless around 10,00 posts can be filled, experts claim . A survey it carried out of 2,438 such nurses found that 75 per cent had to leave patients’ homes before finishing certain tasks - including asking patients if they had any concerns. District nurses mainly care for the elderly in their own homes or care homes and administer medication such as pain relief and eye drops and dress wounds. But they tend to be older than hospital nurses and when they retire, their posts are not being filled. Unless urgent action is taken, the 'critically endangered' nurses will be extinct in just over a decade, it was claimed yesterday. The Government has repeatedly pledged to improve community services such as district nurses to enable the elderly to be cared for in their own homes rather than in hospital. But the RCN said in order for this to happen, an extra 10,000 district nurses needed to be recruited across the NHS. Concern: The lack of community nurses could put many elderly and frail patients at risk . The research, which saw 2,400 district and community nurses polled, . found that most community staff are 'pushed to breaking point', the . spokeswoman said. A quarter said they had seen more than 12 patients . on their last shift, meaning the time actually spent with the patient . was stretched, she added. Many of those questioned raised concerns about the time spent with . patients, with the nurses on average spending just 37 per cent of their time . delivering care. And eight out of 10 said they had worked additional . hours on their last shift. The RCN, which is holding its annual congress in Liverpool this week, . has also called on health officials to make training nurses have a . mandatory placement in the community. Peter Carter, chief executive and general secretary of the RCN, . said: ""People are living longer, but not necessarily healthier, lives. This trend will grow over the coming decades and presents a very . specific nursing challenge. 'The district nurse role is the . foundation of a system which should be able to manage conditions and . keep sick and frail people at home. Remove those foundations and the . whole edifice could come crashing down. 'By 2025, there will be many thousands of families with frail older relatives, who may well have survived a number of illnesses - and when they look for help to manage at home, it simply won't be there.' A Department of Health spokeswoman said: 'The chief nursing officer has set up a working group which is looking specifically at what we can do to increase the number of community nurses and we are committed to training 10,000 more frontline community staff by 2020.'","Stark warning has been issued by the Royal College of Nursing .

"By . Lizzie Parry . One glass of wine or beer at the age of 14 can set teenagers on a path to binge drinking by 16, a new study has found . A single glass of wine or beer at the age of 14 can help a young teenager along the path to binge drinking, say scientists. Early alcohol experience is one of a wide range of factors that can be used to identify future binge drinkers, experts said today. Others include personality traits such as risk and sensation seeking, family history, genetics and brain structure. Combined together, they were able to predict who from a large group of 14-year-olds would be binge drinking by the age of 16 with 70 per cent accuracy. Having even a single alcoholic drink at the age of 14 was shown to be a 'powerful' predictor of binge drinking, possibly because of its association with risk-taking and impulsivity. Dr Hugh Garavan, from the University of Vermont in Canada, who co-led the study, said the vulnerable period between the ages of 14 and 16 was 'critical' to a young person’s future drinking behaviour. 'Just delaying people drinking by six months or a year is actually a very, very substantial intervention that would have vast beneficial consequences,' he added. A computer was used to analyse a wealth of data on more than 2,000 14-year-olds from England, Ireland, France and Germany. All were participants in IMAGEN, a major ongoing study of adolescent development. The software looked for patterns that singled out those youngsters who went on to become binge drinkers by the age of 16 - defined as having got drunk on at least three separate occasions. Results were confirmed by predicting binge drinking with the same accuracy in a separate group of teenagers. The findings appear in the latest issue of the journal Nature. 'Notably, it’s not the case that there’s a single one or two or three variables that are critical,' said Dr Garavan. 'The final model was very broad - it suggests that a wide mixture of reasons underlie teenage drinking.' One surprising discovery was that bigger brains in 14-year-olds are associated with future binge drinking. Adolescents undergo significant rewiring in their developing brains, so that it is normal for their brains to reduce to a more efficient size. Bigger brains in adolescents are therefore a sign of immaturity. Scientists at the University of Vermont in Canada found early alcohol consumption was a factor in determining who would binge drink. They found delaying a first alcoholic drink by just six months made a difference . 'There’s refining and sculpting of the brain, and most of the grey matter - the neurons and the connections between them - is getting smaller and the white matter (made from nerve fibres) is getting larger,' said Dr Garavan. 'Kids with more immature brains - those that are still larger - are more likely to drink.' Co-author and IMAGEN leader Professor Gunter Schumann, from the Institute of Psychiatry at King’s College London, said: 'We aimed to develop a ‘gold standard’ model for predicting teenage behaviour, which can be used as a benchmark for the development of simpler, widely applicable prediction models. 'This work will inform the development of specific early interventions in carriers of the risk profile to reduce the incidence of adolescent substance abuse. We now propose to extend analysis of the IMAGEN data in order to investigate the development of substance use patterns in the context of moderating environmental factors, such as exposure to nicotine or drugs as well as psychosocial stress.'","Scientists at the University of Vermont in Canada discovered early alcohol experience is linked to binge drinking later in life .

"By . Michael Gadd for MailOnline . Americans get the least paid vacation time in the world, research of developed nations has revealed. While employees in other countries enjoy as many as 40 days off a year, U.S. workers are legally entitled to no paid vacation, although many get 10 days of national holidays, the studies found. A map compiled by Thrillist combining data from Mercer's Worldwide Benefit And Employment Guidelines and the Center for Economic and Policy Research shows the stark differences in vacation allowances across the world. The results cover 64 countries with the figures based on entitlements for employees with 10 years of service who work a five-day week. Give us a break: This graphic shows that Brazil, Bolivia, the U.K. and others parts of Europe lead the world in paid vacation time - whereas American workers are not legally entitled to any paid days off . According to the data, the U.S. is the only country out of all those featured that does not require employers to give their workers paid leave. By comparison, Brazilians get 30 paid vacation days plus 11 national holidays, for a staggering total of 41 days off each year, according to research by Mercer in 2009. The map shows that the UK is also among the world's leader when it comes to annual paid leave with 28 days. The catch for Brits, however, is that public holidays can be included in workers' 28 days. The rest of Europe also does quite well when it comes to getting paid to take time off. The report says Poland boasts 26 compulsory days while Austria, Denmark, Finland, France, Greece, Luxembourg and Sweden all get 25 days off as standard. Austrians also get 13 public holidays each year, giving them a massive total of 38 days off. Stark differences: A chart compiled by the Center for Economic and Policy Research shows that workers in the U.S. get zero paid vacation days, while countries in Europe fare much better . Hot spot: US workers have some of the world's iconic attractions on their doorstep, including the Grand Canyon and Las Vegas, but have to work their socks off to enjoy them . In other parts of the globe, French workers get 31 days including public holidays, Bolivians get a 37 days when 10 public holidays are included, while Sweden and Luxembourg both get 25 days statutory leave and a total of 36 altogether. With a single year of service in a job, workers in Finland are entitled to 30 days off. At the other end of the spectrum comes India with 12 days (28 with public holidays), China (10 days and a total of 21), Thailand (6 days compulsory leave and 22 in total) and the Philippines (20 in total including just five compulsory).","Employers in the US don't have to give their staff any paid leave - although many are paid for the 10 national holidays .

A judge in the southern city of Krasnodar ruled to convert an earlier suspended sentence for Yevgeny Vitishko, 40, into a full prison term after deciding he had broken the terms of the agreement. Vitishko, a geologist, is a member of the Environmental Watch on North Caucasus activist group and one of the most prominent figures in a campaign to shed light on the environmental impact of Olympic construction in the city of Sochi. Jailed: A judge in the southern city of Krasnodar ruled to convert an earlier suspended sentence for Yevgeny Vitishko (pictured) into a full prison term after deciding he had broken the terms of the agreement . Vitishko was originally convicted in June 2012 for being part of a group that caused over £2,000 damage to property linked to the regional governor of Krasnodar, Alexander Tkachyov. He was given a suspended three-year jail term for the crime, which the court said was motivated by hooliganism. Ally: The governor of the Krasnodar region is a strong supporter of Vladimir Putin (pictured) The governor of the Krasnodar region, which includes the city of Sochi, is a strong supporter of Russian President Vladimir Putin and is said to have been closely involved in the construction projects relating to the Games. Vitishko was found guilty along with another activist Suren Gazaryan for breaking into a construction site in a forest in late 2011, where the pair claim to have found evidence that protected tree species were being logged. The group were found guilty of spraying slogans, including 'The forest is for everybody' on a corrugated metal fence on the construction site. In a separate court appearance last week, Vitishko was jailed for 15 days for allegedly swearing at a bus stop, although his lawyer said that no witnesses testified against him. He gave evidence in the trial via video link from Tuapse, a town neighbouring Sochi where Vitishko is currently detained. The Sochi Games, which run until February 23, are the biggest event to be held in Russia since the fall of the Soviet Union.

Football Association general secretary Alex Horne said the friendlies against teams who have won four out of last five World Cups had been arranged in the run-up to Euro 2016 but the dates have yet to be confirmed. Horne also admitted there will be a record low turn-out for an England game at the new Wembley when Norway come next week for a friendly. Champions: England will play World Champions Germany as part of their build-up to Euro 2016 . Repeat: Roy Hodgson's men will also face Italy, who beat the Three Lions 2-1 during the World Cup in Brazil . Speaking after a UEFA meeting in Monaco, Horne said: 'We have got a set of friendlies to go with the qualifiers right through to March 2016 all arranged. 'We will be playing the bigger European countries - it makes more sense to prepare for a European tournament by playing European opposition so we have put less of an emphasis on non-Europeans over the next two years. 'Home and away we will be playing France, Spain, Italy and Germany.' England will play Norway with only the lower tier of Wembley occupied by fans due to low ticket sales. Horne added: 'We are expecting 35-40,000. It will be the lowest crowd we have had at Wembley, the average England gate is 79,000 so it is disappointing. Chance to lead: England's new captain Wayne Rooney will have the opportunity to play against top opposition .

'We have relaunched our England supporters club, we are aiming to get half a million members and ultimately attract a brand new audience to fill 70,000 general admission seats five times a year.' Horne said the low ticket sales should not cause any financial problems for the FA. 'We didn't budget for a big crowd for this game. It's traditionally a difficult sell,' he said.

"By . Sean Gallagher for MailOnline . Mario Balotelli joined his team-mates in training for the second time at Melwood on Thursday as they await who they will face in the UEFA Champions League group stage following a five-year exile from the competition. The Reds will be dreaming for a repeat of their European success in Istanbul in 2005 when they fought back from three goals down to finally get the better of AC Milan on penalties, in what will go down as one of the most memorable European finals of all time.

"By . John Hall . Scientists in California are warning that the state may experience a century-long 'mega-drought'. The warnings come after sediment studies showed California is currently experiencing the driest spell since 1580, and that the regular rainfall seen during the last century is likely to have been a temporary deviation in a cycle of droughts and very occasional rainfall over the last 3,000 years. In 2013, California received less rain than in any year since its formation as a state in 1850, and even though several inches fell last week it wasn't anywhere near enough to lift the drought. No hope: The warnings of up to 100 years of drought come after sediment studies showed California is currently experiencing its driest spell since 1580 . Lynn Ingram, from the University of California Berkeley, says droughts lasting more than 100 years are far from unheard of in the state, adding there is every chance another could be on its way following the driest spell five centuries. She told CBS News: 'If we go back several thousand years, we've seen that droughts can last over a decade, and in some cases, they can last over a century.' 'These patterns tend to repeat themselves... I mean, we can expect that this will happen again,' she added. With 95 per cent of California currently in drought, Ms Ingram and her team have been studying 3,000-years of sediment samples in the state in the hope of producing a definitive history of drought in the Western world. The only hope of the California drought lifting . anytime soon appears to be the predicted arrival later this year of El . Nino - the weather system that causes periodic climate changes in the . Pacific Ocean. Last week a . storm brought some of the highest rainfall totals to the Los Angeles . area in years, including eight inches on some mountains. Before: To illustrate the severity of California's drought, the water department released a comparison photo of Folsom reservoir near Sacramento . And after: Now, just three years later, the lake is at 17 per cent capacity. Almost the entire state of California is currently experiencing drought . Although the storm was incredibly strong, forecasters said such systems would have to become common for the state to make serious inroads against the drought. 'We need several large storms and we just don't see that on the horizon,' National Weather Service meteorologist Eric Boldt said. 'This is a rogue storm. We will dry out next week.' In Azusa and neighboring foothill communities about 25 miles east of Los Angeles that sit beneath nearly 2,000 acres of steep mountain slopes that just weeks ago were menaced by a wildfire, about 1,200 homes were under evacuation orders over mudflow fears but were so-far spared. Not enough: Even though several inches fell in California last week, it wasn't anywhere near enough to lift the drought and replenish ground water supplies . In particular danger were about a dozen homes in Azusa that were backed up against a steep fire-denuded hillside several hundred feet high that authorities feared could collapse. Scientists say their research shows the 20th century was one of the wettest centuries in the past 1,300 years. During that time, we built massive dams and rerouted rivers. We used abundant water to build major cities and create a $45 billion agriculture industry in a place that used to be a desert. Even after several inches of rain last week, the drought continues. Ingram believes California should be prepared for an eventual 100-year-long dry period.","Scientists warn 95 per cent of California may see 100 years of drought .

These pictures capture moments that are almost impossible to see with the naked eye, and show birds, bats, frogs and even mice mid-flight, fleeing, feeding and interacting with each other. The shots were taken by Nicolas Reusens, 38, who spent hours crouched in caves - often up to his knees in water - waiting for the perfect moments to snap these amazing images. Scroll down for video . Stretching out: A brightly-coloured frog takes a giant jump, leaving its body at full-stretch as it soars through the blackness .

I believe I can fly: A tiny mouse soars through the air as it leaps from one branch to another, snapped mid-flight by photographer Nicolas Reusens . He said: 'I knew what kind of shots I wanted to get, but it required a great deal of patience to get them. 'When I finally looked at my set, I felt as though I had won the lottery. 'I had to study each animal and their behaviours to determine how best to take each photo. Flying frog: This colourful green and yellow frog leaps towards the camera lens from a mossy branch in a Costa Rican cave . Hovering hummingbirds: These colourful creatures suspend themselves in mid-air, their green, blue and purple feathers catching the light for the camera . 'There are two ways to shoot, either manually, by waiting and knowing exactly the feeding locations of each specimen, or automatically with specialised gear that automated the camera shooting when an invisible barrier is trespassed. 'Both systems require tonnes of patience and time. First to locate the perfect location for the camera and flashes, then also time to fine tune on the possible subjects in order to get them nicely focused. 'The barrier triggers the camera and the flashes so all the previous efforts of gear collocation and focus will be of great importance. Taking a lick: A bat flicks out its long tongue as it nears a tasty-looking red and orange fruit, its leathery wings guiding it towards the prize .

'Bats are very difficult to get to at first, but when you get the focus in the sweet spot it's just a game of waiting and good luck. 'The more bats the easier to get one in focus. I had to enter a cave with water to my knees for 20 minutes, mount my gear, and wait for one hour until the first bat came out. It was pretty hard because I was inside a cave with the only light that comes from your headlamp, humidity and your precious gear only few centimetres from the water.

"By . Daniel Mills for Daily Mail Australia . Photography was the furthest thing from Holly Spring's mind when daughter Violet was struck down with a debilitating bowel condition that almost cost her her life. Born with just one hand, her right, the new born 'went blue in the face' following surgical complications to correct a bowel condition known as Hirschprung's disease. Clinging to life in an Auckland Hospital, it was at that this point her New Zealand mother realised just how incredibly important her daughter's fragile life was to her, so she began documenting it using digital photography. Holly Spring wanted to show that her daughter could live a normal childhood through her work . Using a beach backdrop, a photo of a giraffe at a zoo and a photo of her daughter Holly Spring created this digital image . Violet Spring, at just four, has had to endure a difficult upbringing due to her poor health . 'Ive always been an artist, I'm in a rock band, but digital photography didn't come until after that close call,' the 38-year-old award winning photographer said. Mrs Spring, whose daughter still lives with the debilitating condition despite surgery to remove a third of her bowel, does not know when Violet could relapse again and takes every day in her stride. 'At any time she might need more surgery or she could get a blockage...you just never know.' Combined with an inability to use her left arm, Mrs Spring wanted to show through her work that the person she describes as her 'muse' and her 'heart’ was capable of living a normal, everyday childhood. She said Violet was the reason she decided to dedicate a life to her new career, which she is now an award winner after claiming the 2014 New Zealand Portrait Creative Photographer of the Year. 'I realised I would have had no decent quality memories of her after that (possible death). 'So my husband bought me a camera, a  DSLR, and from that point on I started shooting her growing, and going from strength to strength.' Many of Holly Spring's images show her daughter's left arm with the focal point centred on her right hand . 'growing from strength to strength:' Holly has been teaching her daughter to utilise her disability for good . Holly and Violet 'role play' certain scenes to capture the best image that brings out the four-year-old's exuberant personality . Holly was awarded the NZ Portrait Creative Photographer of the Year for 10 images she submitted of her daughter . Experimenting with different digital layers, colours and other new found skills she began role playing different scenarios with her four-year-old. 'I get her to look at things around her, the wondrous things that she sees and how she interacts with them.' One of her favourite images - a shot of her daughter looking up at a Giraffe - was part of a compilation of 10 images that earned her her national photography award. Using three individual photographs, Mrs Spring layered each of the images on top of another to create the stunning affect of her daughter playing with the long-necked animal. On holiday, she shot an image of a stunning beach landscape, one of her daughter playing in the street and another of a giraffe at a zoo. She said the most important subject matter in each of her images is her daughter.

"By . Victoria Woollaston . The domination of apps such as Whatsapp, Viber and Facebook Messenger is continuing to grow, according to a new report. Researchers at Deloitte claim the average person sends seven text messages a day, compared to 46 instant messages. And, by the end of the year, they predict more than 300 billion instant messages will be sent in the UK alone. Research from Deloitte has revealed the average person sends seven text messages a day, compared to 46 instant messages. Experts predicts the number of instant message will reach 300 billion by the end of the year, and almost a quarter of smartphone owners use five or more messaging apps, such as Whatsapp (pictured) The findings come from the Global Mobile Consumer Survey 2014, which polled more than 3,600 people in May this year. A recent poll from computer-tracking software firm RetinaX studios discovered the peak sexting hours are between 10am and noon on Tuesdays. The study, which polled 4,800 people, also revealed iPhone users sext almost twice as frequently as Android users. University of Michigan researchers recently studied the sexting behaviour of 3,447 men and women aged between 18 and 24. They discovered that nearly half of the study respondents participated in sexting. Most people who reported receiving sexts also reported sending them, which the study claimed suggests sexting is reciprocal and likely happens between romantic partners. If correct, this prediction would mean instant messaging has almost doubled in popularity in just a year, up from 160 billion last year, and 25 billion in 2010. Text messages are still the most popular form of communication, but instant messaging leads on the number of messages sent. And Deloitte is also predicting that 2014 will be the first year texting will decline since it was invented in 1992. ‘During different phases of your life. You talk more and are more social,’ Deloitte’s head of technology, media and telecommunications Paul Lee told the MailOnline. ‘And generally when you’re younger and you’re looking for a relationship, you talk with more people. If correct, Deloitte's prediction would mean instant messaging has almost doubled in popularity in just a year, up from 160 billion last year, and 25 billion in 2010 (plotted on this graph). The findings come from the Deloitte Global Mobile Consumer Survey 2014 . ‘This has always been the case, it’s just text messaging replaced phone calls, and IM messages are having a similar impact on texts. ‘Instant messaging also offers new ways to communicate, so whereas before we would send a sentence to express our sentiments, people now exchange emoticons and images.’ When asked why texts and instant messages are seen by smartphone users as being so different, yet are fundamentally the same, Mr Lee said that it’s down to habits and cost. Text messages are still the most popular form of communication (as seen in this graph) but instant messaging leads on the number of messages sent overall. Deloitte is also predicting that 2014 will be the first year texting will decline since it was invented in 1992 . ‘Around 10 years ago, teenagers would visit internet cafes and send hundreds and thousands of IMs to each other. ‘That behaviour hasn’t changed, it’s just moved onto smartphones. In the same way emails are now accessible on phones. ‘Also, IMs don’t have a marginal cost, so people can be quite wasteful with the amount of IMs they send. 'Individual text messages, traditionally, came at a cost and even though the price is now lower, and in some cases is free on unlimited plans, this perception is difficult to change.’","The findings are taken from London-based research firm Deloitte .

"By . Jonathan O'Callaghan . Researchers have claimed that allowing employees to surf the internet at work could boost their productivity. The results suggest that for those with jobs that don't involve sitting at a desk, a quick jaunt online can make them more productive. Workers who took the online breaks had a quick chance to unwind, but the researchers warned that if surfing was undisciplined it could result in ‘cyberloafing’ - those who spend too much time doing other things online when they should be working. A study led by a researcher at the University of Cincinnati suggests taking short online breaks can boost productivity (stock image shown). However spending too much time online turns people into cyberloafers. This means they spend too much time doing other things online when they should be working . The study's lead author Dr Sung Doo Kim of the Carl H. Lindner College of Business at the University of Cincinnati  said: ‘Employees reported benefits on going online to balance their work and personal responsibilities, such as checking on their children.’ Using phones and tablets to access work email outside office hours can dramatically increase stress levels, researchers have warned. The research could have major implications for those who work away from the office. However, those who worked remotely also rated the quality of their lives as being better than those stuck in an office. A Gallup poll found nearly half of workers who 'frequently email for work outside of normal working hours' reported experiencing 'a lot of' stress, compared with the 36 per cent who experienced stress but never emailed out of work. ‘After reassuring themselves about their children, they were better able to focus on their work.’ Dr Kim added that people going online for industry news or research saw it as part of their professional development and improved satisfaction at work. He suggested this was perhaps because of the freedom to be able to occasionally check in on their personal life. The researchers added that they found three consequences to these breaks: ‘momentary recovery, learning, and satisfaction.’ However, the potential benefits of the online breaks should come with a warning to bosses, according to the study. Researchers suggested that if taken in an ‘undisciplined manner,’ these breaks could turn into cyberloafing, resulting in the excessive loss of time and productivity. Dr Kim said that previous research has focused on breaks during off-job hours such as evening, weekend and vacation periods, or on traditional ‘offline’ breaks taken during working hours, such as lunch or coffee breaks. However, the team decided to research online breaks during work hours and held extensive interviews with 33 professionals from a variety of industries and occupations about the practice. The research shows that the tactic is most effective for people with active jobs. People taking online breaks with desk jobs were less productive, however (stock image shown) The researchers examined several factors including triggers that prompt online work breaks, conditions that lead to taking an online break rather than an offline break, different online break activities and consequences of these actions. The study discovered that workers engaged in online work breaks when they reported a high need for recovery, such as feeling tired from an intense work period, or recovering from a reported significant loss of physical or emotional energy. Triggers also included breaking monotony or boredom, checking on demands at home and other personal demands, or emotional work-related events that triggered anger or frustration, according to the researchers. The scientists said that workers whose jobs required extensive computer time or sitting at a desk for prolonged periods were less likely to find online breaks rejuvenating, compared to jobs that required a good deal of physical activity or a lot of face-to-face interaction, when employees relax with some ‘alone time’ online. The research, which is to be presented to the Academy of Management in Philadelphia, found that the company policy affected employees’ likelihood of taking these breaks. Some of the employees reported that their workplace had strict policies on the personal use of workplace computers. Dr Kim added that older workers who had spent years in the workplace previous to the birth of the Internet frowned on online breaks, stating that they were being ‘paid to work.’","A study by  the University of Cincinnati suggests taking short online breaks can boost productivity .

"Aussie athlete John van Wisse has thrashed the world record for the Arch to Arc ultra-triathlon by 12 hours and 12 minutes. The gruelling course ran from London's Marble Arch to the Arc de Triomphe in Paris. The 41-year-old Melbournian is only the 14th person to ever compete in this extremely tough sporting event. Scroll down for video . John van Wisse, 41, from Melbourne has smashed the world record for the Arch to Arc race . At 5.45am on Friday, Melbourne time, Mr John van Wisse finally crossed the finish line after 61 hours and 27 minutes. Mr Van Wisse told the 3AW breakfast show just after finishing the race that he was ecstatic with the result. 'I've done some brutal training and it's been a year's build-up and I'm just absolutely stoked,' he said. 'It's kind of surreal, I can't believe it's all happening. It's like a dream.' Winner of the gruelling Arch to Arc triathlon, John van Wisse is only 1 of 14 people to take on the race . The race began on Tuesday with a 140km run from London to Dover where the competitors were set to swim across the English Channel to France. It was only one day earlier that Mr Van Wisse was mistaken by Dover residents as an illegal immigrant trying to swim to shore while he was taking part in swimming training for the event. After the gruelling swim across the channel, the race required Mr van Wisse and his fellow racers to ride bikes from Calais in the north of France. From, running, to cycling to swimming, this race is no ordinary triathlon. Mr van Wisse completed it in 61 hours . From Calais he rode 291-kilometres south to the Arc de Triomphe in the busy city of Paris. Being just one of 14 people to take part in this international ultra-triathlon, it doesn't come as a surprise that the athlete loves to push himself to the limit. 'I just like big challenges and I couldn't think of anything harder than this,' he said. 'If someone breaks my record then I might come back and have another crack, so hopefully no one does.' Mr van Wisse has taken to Twitter to thank his sponsors and supporters. He has also said he will be spending some time recuperating in France with his team.

"By . Chris Kitching for MailOnline . Immigration officers at a busy ferry terminal on an Indonesian island have issued a directive that is loud and clear – remain silent or else you will be kicked out of the country. The new rule is putting foreign visitors at risk of being deported for talking or using a mobile phone in the immigration queue at the Batam Center International Ferry Terminal on the island of Batam. Even speaking in a whisper could lead to passengers being turned around and put on the next ferry back to Singapore or Malaysia, according to a report in The Straits Times. Quiet: Visitors risk being deported if they make noise in the immigration queue at a Batam ferry terminal . The order went into effect this month when workers put up signs showing an image of a raised finger over a pair of lips. Shushed visitors stand in silence as the quiet is broken only by the repeated thumping of passports or the odd passenger who strikes up a conversation without known the consequences. Guo Kai told The Straits Times he and a friend went to Batam, located off the south coast of Singapore, for a weekend getaway, but they were sent back to Singapore for speaking in the queue. He said an immigration officer had warned them to stop talking, but he had ‘no idea the penalty was going to be so harsh’. ‘I was there for a holiday – why couldn’t I open my mouth? I was just chit-chatting with my friend.’ Shhh! Posters at Batam Center ferry terminal instruct visitors to remain silent in the immigration queue . About 50 Singaporeans have been turned back every week, according to a report on a website called The Real Singapore. The one-hour ferry ride from Singapore to Batam is popular with day trippers or visitors on weekend breaks, costing about £24. Batam Center Immigration Office chief Irwanto Suhaili defended the tactic, saying his officers need quiet to maintain order. He said tourists would not be able to hear their names being called if visitors were allowed to make noise. Ferry operators told the newspaper the same rules are in place at Sekupang, a city on Batam, but they are not strictly enforced.","Batam Center ferry terminal in Indonesia implemented the rule this month .

"By . Sarah Griffiths For Mailonline . You may think any superyacht would be large and luxurious enough for the most discerning of people. But now the world’s most luxurious vessel has enough room for guests and an entourage of helpers because it features its own detachable floating bungalows and even a swimming pool and garden. The 250ft long (77metre) vessel has been designed to act as a 'mother ship' for a series of luxury modules so that guests don’t get under the owner’s feet and they can have some privacy at sea. The 250ft long (77metre) vessel has been designed to act as a 'mother ship' for a series of luxury modules so that guests don’t get under the owner’s feet and they can have some privacy at sea. This concept shows that friends, children and the owners could all have separate floating 'bungalows' while the vessel is anchored . The brochure for the superyacht shows modules being towed along until the vessel reaches its destination. Once anchored, the modules can be separated and used as tiny floating boltholes. It also has its own inflatable walk-ashore pontoon so guests can move straight from the boat onto the beach without dipping their toes in the water. Despite its enormous size, owners could sail the carbon-fibre yacht very close to the shore because of its shallow hull design. A giro system would also keep living quarters level at no matter how rough the seas got, guests could continue to dine in style without the risk of seasickness. The design for the superyacht hints that the modules will be towed along (pictured) until it reaches its destination and once anchored, the modules can be separated and used as tiny floating boltholes . Despite its enormous size, owners could sail the carbon-fibre boat close to the shore because of its shallow hull design (pictured) The vessel is a concept and would cost hundred of millions of pounds to build . The yacht, called the 77m X R-Evolution, is still a concept but its designers say it could be made for hundreds of millions of pounds. The luxurious creation is the brainchild of yacht designers Pastrovich Studio from Monaco. Its brochure reads: The ‘77m X R-Evolution is a mother-ship with separately deployable daughter vessels each of which as unique as your imagination can conjure up. ‘Imagine - instead of guest apartments, each daughter vessel is a different luxury object: a swimming pool, a garden, even an artificial beach complete with its own palm trees. A giro system (illustrated) would also keep living quarters level at no matter how rough the seas are, so guests could continue to dine in style without the risk of seasickness . The ship is currently only a concept. This design shows that it could be built with berths for motorboats and a swimming pool connected to a hexagonal 'dining island' which would create an incredible setting for dinner . The X R-Evolution is currently a concept and would cost hundreds of millions of pounds to build. It would measure 250ft (77metres). It is designed to act as a 'mother ship' for a series of luxury modules. Modules could include ‘bungalows,’ a swimming pool, garden, artificial beach, dining area and ship berths to suit an owner’s needs. The carbon fibre yacht has a shallow hull design s it can anchor close to the shore. A giro system would also keep living quarters level at no matter how rough the seas got. ‘Lay anchor in the Virgin Islands and deploy your apartments anywhere you desire. ‘Be waited on hand and foot by the crew living aboard the mother-ship or go it alone in your own isolated beach fronted apartment.’ ‘Combine this with the simple, inflatable, modular jetty connected directly to the beach and guests can move freely between the mother ship and their own private apartment.’ Emanuele Gallo Perozzi, a spokesman for Pastrovich Studio, said: ‘In this project our main goal was to assure the owner total privacy. ‘On a luxury 77 metre yacht there are up to 40 crew working all the time and so the owners and their guests sometimes need to escape. ‘Usually, clients ask us to develop small, fast tenders they can use to spend a night at anchor far from the main vessel. ‘So we thought why don't we provide the main vessel with one or more “bungalows” that can be detached and anchored as the owner desire? ‘These bungalows can be set as rest places, floating swimming pools, private gardens, floating platforms with real sand.’ The vessel's brochure reads: The ‘77m X R-Evolution is a mother-ship with separately deployable daughter vessels each of which as unique as your imagination can conjure up.' Modules of a bungalow and swimming pool with an area for sunbathing can be seen being towed along by the yacht in this illustration . If someone did pay the vast sum of money needed to build their bespoke yacht, complete with floating modules, they could choose their own modules and play with the configuration of them being towed along. These designs show how a pool, dining area and boat berths could be arranged .","The X R-Evolution is a mother-ship with separately deployable modules .

"By . Ellie Zolfagharifard . It’s not just polar bears years from now that will be affected by climate change, the dangers of a warming Earth are immediate and very human. This is according the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) which said this year that the impact of climate change is ‘widespread and consequential.’ Yet the impact seen in the future still largely depends on the actions countries take to reduce their emissions today, the report said. The World Resources Institute has created an infographic, based on IPCC data, that depicts the likely consequences of various emissions pathways. In the low emissions pathway, the IPCC data suggests that carbon dioxide output will peak by 2020 and then drop 66 per cent below 2010 levels by 2020 . Now, the World Resources Institute has created an infographic, based on IPCC data, that depicts the likely consequences of various emissions pathways. Alongside each pathway, it shows what the future might hold in terms of climate impacts - ranging from temperature increases to precipitation changes to ecosystem degradation. Each pathway also notes the year the world will likely exhaust the remaining carbon budget. This is the amount of carbon the planet can emit before locking itself into warming of greater than 2°C above pre-industrial levels. The medium emissions scenario suggests that carbon dioxide emissions will peak by 2040, but still rise 19 per cent above 2010 levels. Global productivity is expected to drop by 20 per cent by 2100 as a result of heat stress affecting workers. Meanwhille, two-thirds of the worlds coral reefs will experience long-term damage . Europe: The IPCC expects damage to the Mediterranean. This will increase energy costs and damage tourism from 2050. North America: Flooding will be a major threat in this area with rain and storms moving north of New York. Asia: The majority of the people directly affected by sea level rise will be in southern and eastern Asia. Australasia: There remains uncertainty about impact in Australasia, but extreme weather is predicted. Africa: Food security will be a major issue for Africa. Crops and livestock will be affected by both flooding and drought. Central and South America: Scientists expect Northern Brazil may lose 22 per cent of its annual rainfall by 2100. In the low emissions pathway, carbon dioxide output will peak by 2020 and then drop 66 per cent below 2010 levels by 2020. The world will still face some challenging consequences from climate change. For instance, around 24 per cent more of the projected global population will face reduced renewable water resources by the 2080s compared to the 1980s. In the 2080s around four times as many people will be exposed to flood water compared with the 1980s. The medium emissions scenario suggests that carbon dioxide emissions will peak by 2040, but still rise 19 per cent above 2010 levels. This means roughly two-thirds of the world's coral reefs will experience long-term damage over the next few decades. In this scenario, the world's carbon budget will be exhausted is 2056, compared to 2057 under a high emissions scenario. With temperature increases of three to four degrees, food security could have an impact so widespread that humans will not be able to adapt. The worst case scenario suggests annual carbon dioxide emissions will continue to rise through 2100, rising 108 per cent above 2010 levels by 2050. If this happens, the WRI believes the carbon budget will be exhausted by 2045. Overall, the IPCC warns that violent conflicts, food shortages and serious infrastructure damage will affect the world if global warming continues at its current pace. It argues that rising temperatures will exacerbate poverty and damage land and marine species. It also claims that the world is in ‘an era of man-made climate change’ and has already seen impacts of global warming on every continent and across the oceans. With temperature increases of three to four degrees, food security could have an impact so widespread that humans will not be able to adapt, the IPCC data claims . In Europe, there will be increased economic losses and more people affected by flooding in river basins and coasts, in the face of rising sea levels and heavy rainstorms. Most of the flood damage can be avoided by measures such as flood defences, but the costs of increasing protection will be high. There will also be a reduction in water availability from rivers and groundwater, while increased heat waves will damage human health and quality of life, crop production, increase air pollution and the risk of wildfires in southern Europe and parts of Russia. Professor Corinne Le Quere, director of the Tyndall Centre for Climate Change Research at University of East Anglia said: ‘We need rapid and substantial cuts in carbon emissions and a move away from burning fossil fuels if we are to limit global climate change below two degrees and mitigate these impacts.' ‘The bottom line is that it’s still possible to limit global temperature rise to 2°C, preventing some of the more disastrous consequences of climate change,’ said the WRI. The worst case scenario suggests annual carbon dioxide emissions will continue to rise through 2100, rising 108 per cent above 2010 levels by 2050.If this happens, the WRI believes the carbon budget will be exhausted by 2045.

Passing through pre-flight security is rated one of the most stressful and unpleasant things by holidaymakers. A fifth of Britons saying it’s the worst thing about going on holiday. Airport security queues and processes create stress for one in five travellers with 28 per cent saying that they get downright annoyed at the length of time they need to wait, the study says. Anthony Clarke-Cowell, spokesman for Holiday Extras, said: ‘Security queues are a necessary evil of airline travel, but there are things that we can all do to make the process less tiresome. Almost a quarter of aren't satisfied with rules requiring them to remove their shoes, belts and jewellery . ‘We recommend travellers familiarise themselves with the regulations completely, prepare their electrical items and liquid bags in advance and consider a Security Fast Track pass to speed them through with a dedicated lane.’ Holidaymakers are facing a new security guideline this summer in light of an apparent terror threat.

He was taken hostage at gunpoint by militants from the group Jabhat al Nusra while reporting from Taftanaz, northern Syria. Disturbing footage of his execution appeared on YouTube last week in a video titled 'A message to the US', in which an apparently coerced Foley, 40, recites a pre-prepared script presumably given to him by his captors which he delivers unflinchingly to the camera. Foley also leaves a haunting message for his brother, John, who he is heard to say is either a past or serving member of the US Air Force. Referring to airstrikes launched nearly two weeks ago in Iraq, Foley says: ‘I died that day, John, when your colleagues dropped that bomb on these people. They signed my death certificate’. It has since emerged that U.S. President Barack Obama sent special forces troops to Syria on a secret mission to rescue American hostages, including James Foley, but they did not find them.","Journalist was covering the Syrian civil war when he was kidnapped .

"By . Carol Driver for MailOnline . Campaign: Lawyer Radd Seiger says the number of people in the sea at any one time should be limited . A health and safety lawyer has called for a limit on the number of holidaymakers allowed in the sea at any one time. Radd Seiger, from Banbury, Oxon, said it’s only a matter of time before someone is seriously injured due to overcrowding at Cornish beaches. Having been a regular visitor to popular and trendy Polzeath beach for the past 10 years, he claims there has been an 'explosion' in the number of surfers and bodyboarders. Mr Seiger’s calls come after he and his 15-year-old daughter was hit by a surfboard on the beach in Cornwall earlier this year. He said he has voiced his fears to the RNLI - and Cornwall Council - and was told by a safety manager that 'the volume of people in the water was a concern to the charity'. And he claims the manager told him he would not take his own family into the water. ‘When you get someone from that wonderful charity saying something like that then you know it is an issue,’ he said. Mr Seiger is so fearful that he said he would not be returning to Polzeath until action is taken to limit the number of people in the water. ‘The council need to get people there for the economy so they are encouraging people into the water but no-one is grasping the mettle and saying “if we put too many people in the water something bad is going to happen”.’ He said RNLI should be given powers to enforced designated areas for surfers, swimmers and bodyboarders, as well as limiting the number of people in the water if necessary. Popular beach: Polzeath in Cornwall is becoming overcrowded with bodyboarders, according to Seiger . Busy: The lawyer said there are too many holidaymakers in the sea at Polzeath beach at the same time . ‘It's the council's responsibility - they have got overall responsibility for health and safety,’ he said. ‘Someone is going to get hurt unless something is done.’ Prime Minister David Cameron and his family often holiday at Polzeath, and in July 2012 Princes William and Harry and their friends went there to body-board. Holidaymakers and local residents hit back at Mr Seiger’s demands. On Facebook, Frank Bradshaw wrote: ‘People have been using the sea for years! Why it is this nation needs babysitting! ‘If they ain't falling off of the cliffs they're getting into difficulties in the sea. People need to take care of their own actions!’ Debz Coad wrote: ‘The beach is for everyone. ‘Just abide by a few basic safety rules and watch for lifeguards' directions. People, Cornish or not, need to be responsible for their own actions. David and Samantha Cameron, pictured on Pozeath beach during their summer holiday in Cornwall in 2013 . 'Beach is for everyone': Facebook users hit back at Mr Seiger's claims . ‘More folk paying attention to warnings and being self-aware is all that is required.’ Alan Iles added: ‘Perhaps the safest thing to do would be to limit the amount of holidaymakers coming into the county. 'Safer beaches, safer roads, less alcohol induced antics like those recently making the news, and less strain on emergency and public services.’ Cornwall Council's beach safety officer Rolo Deards said: ‘Polzeath is a very popular beach with holidaymakers and with the ever growing popularity of surfing, along with new water-based activities such as stand-up paddle-boarding, this does put a greater pressure on the zoning flag system on the beach. ‘Bathers and bodyboarders should go between the red and yellow flags and surfers or craft users should go between the black and white flags.’ James Millidge, the RNLI's community incident reduction manager, said: ‘We have no authority to enforce a regulation on the number of people using the water.’","Radd Seiger says is only a matter of time before someone is seriously hurt .

"By . Camilla Canocchi For Mailonline . A four-star hotel in the heart of the New Forest National Park has been ordered to pay more than £20,000 in fines after hygiene inspectors found evidence of rat infestation in its kitchen. The Crown Manor House hotel in Lyndhurst, Hampshire, chose to close down its kitchen twice in a month after inspectors found fresh rat droppings underneath and behind kitchen equipment, as well as gnawed eggshells and gnawed paper towels. The hotel, which was fined £16,670 and incurred £4,326 in costs, pleaded guilty to five offences under the Food Hygiene Regulations at the Southampton Magistrates’ Court. Fined: The kitchen of the Crown Manor House in Lyndhurst was infested by rats . Two of the offences involved the production and distribution of food in an area infested with rats. Environmental health officers from New Forest district council visited the hotel in October last year following an anonymous complaint about the hygiene in the hotel’s kitchen. Inspection: The Crown Manor charges up to £144 for a standard double room . The Crown Manor House, which was established in the 15th century and charges up to £144 for a standard double room, received a food hygiene rating of zero - the worst rating under the food hygiene rating scheme. A spokesman for New Forest district council said: ‘Evidence of significant rodent activity was found in the kitchen. ‘Fresh rodent droppings were found underneath and behind equipment as well as gnawed eggshells and gnawed paper towel. ‘Food was not protected against potential contamination.' Following the inspection the hotel agreed to voluntarily close the kitchen and was allowed to reopen it after seven days. But when inspectors visited the hotel’s kitchen again for a routine follow-up check, they again found rat droppings and the hotel again agreed to voluntarily close the kitchen until the infestation had been removed. A hotel spokesman said the rats had come from a derelict building next door that had been empty for many years. The building has since been restored and the hotel installed a new kitchen costing £150,000 as part of a major facelift, he said. He added: ‘The new kitchen is fantastic and our food hygiene standards are very robust, especially as the former problem next door no longer exists.’ Edward Heron, Councillor at New Forest District Council, said: ‘It is totally unacceptable to allow rats into a food business. ‘Environmental health officers took necessary action to protect the health of customers and staff and I am pleased that The Crown Manor House Hotel has responded with improvements and received a food hygiene rating of four.’","The Crown Manor House hotel pleaded guilty to five offences .

"By . Chris Kitching for MailOnline . It’s one of the most unpleasant situations you can find yourself in on a plane – sitting next to a fellow traveller who doesn’t smell very fresh. And passengers believe airlines can do their part to prevent such an uncomfortable scenario, with more than half of them calling on carriers to give out free deodorant to mask bad body odour, a new survey reveals. A poll of 1,100 adult travellers by Cheapflights.co.uk found 52 per cent would prefer a stick of deodorant over any other in-flight freebie. Sniff test: More than half of respondents in a new survey want free in-flight deodorant along with other perks . Complimentary deodorant is included in welcome packs on some business or first class flights, but those travelling in economy aren’t so lucky. And it appears many of those who fly in the lap of luxury are also getting the short end of the stick. A review of welcome kits provided by 27 different airlines found that only four included deodorant. Four in ten English adults – and 20 per cent from the rest of the UK and Ireland – have been lucky enough to enjoy the pampered experience of business or first class travel on a plane, the survey found. Passengers who have received a free upgrade from economy are more likely to get one by flirting than by pretending to be ill or other deceitful means. Cheapflights.co.uk spokesman Oonagh Shiel said: ‘Many airlines go to great effort to ensure they anticipate customers' needs and expectations but it would seem sometimes it's the smallest of tweaks that are needed to the offering to really hit the mark. ‘After all, nobody wants passengers causing a stink.'

"Low-cost airlines easyJet, Ryanair and Aer Lingus received the fewest complaints to UK air regulators last year. The Civil Aviation Authority reported that per million fliers, easyJet received just 33 complaints and Ryanair 35, while just 29 complaints were made about Irish airline Aer Lingus. In the recent years, cancellations, missing bags and denied boarding featured high on the list of gripes which lead to customers of budget airlines making complaints. Happy customers: The Civil Aviation Authority received just 33 complaints per million easyJet fliers last year . Between 2005 and 2010, Ryanair complaints rose by 70 per cent  and easyJet's by a third over the same period, according to the Air Transport Users' Council (AUC). High costs for checked in baggage, long queues and poor service have often wrangled with travellers flying on low-cost airlines, but it seems we're now happier to fly cheaply and cheerfully. Bob Atkinson of TravelSupermarket.com said: 'It's fantastic to see that three of the cheapest airlines have some of the lowest complaints.' Meanwhile, package holiday specialists Thomas Cook and Thomson did not rate so highly, both receiving record high numbers of gripes. Satisfied customers: Low-cost airline Ryanair had just 35 complaints per million passengers during 2013 . Per million customers, 616 made complaints about Thomas Cook, while Thomson got 256 gripes per million. Meanwhile US Airways received 174 and Virgin Atlantic 139. In 2013, the CAA received 229,778 complaints about flights from the UK in total. It also reports that 84 per cent of scheduled flights into the UK landed on time this year.

"By . Katie Amey For Mailonline . Rotterdam has just announced plans to break ground on a water-purifying wave pool smack dab in the middle of the city - meaning it will soon be possible to surf on a canal in the Netherlands. In June 2015, Rotterdam will open RiF010, a barrelling 5ft, 14-second wave, situated on the city's famed Steigersgracht Canal, very near to the retail centre. Initially conceived by Edwin van Viegan, the proposed City Initiative is currently in development at the Delft University of Technology, where a particular focus is being placed on the project's durability and sustainability. Scroll down for video . Surf's up! The water-purifying wave pool will be open to surfers, divers, and boating enthusiasts of all abilities . The artificial river wave will not only generate electricity and provide power to the site, but will also offer additional environmental benefits to residents of the country's second-largest city. Currently, the canal is made up of unsweetened pond water, but the wave-making process itself will actually work to naturally purify it. Additionally, any profit made from the wave pool will be reinvested both into the city's existing green initiatives and also directly back into the project, with hopes of developing an independent energy-generating windmill for the site in coming years. The RiF010 arena will cater mostly to kayakers, scuba divers, and surfers. Urban oasis: In June 2015, Rotterdam will open RiF010 - a barrelling 5ft, 14-second wave in the city centre . The site will also offer a terrace for spectators, a beach house with food and drink, and changing rooms and shower facilities.

But holidaymakers who enjoy the sport can now book to ride the waves in North Korea. The secretive country's 1,550-mile east coast is offering surfing tours, with three resorts opening to tourists. Scroll down for video . Surf's up: The Korea International Travel Company is offering surfing tours to foreign tourists . The Korea International Travel Company (KITC) will be selling tours to tourists in the resorts of Songdowon, Lake Sijung and Majon for the five-day, four-night breaks - with the first excursion at the end of July deemed a success, according to the Pyongyang Times. During their stay, visitors are welcome to explore tourist attractions and places of historic interest in Pyongyang and other local areas. However, the real attraction is the East Sea of Korea, which, according to the paper, offers  high and low waves, catering to athletes of all abilities. Making waves: Songdowon, Lake Sijung and Majon are open only to foreign surf enthusiasts . 'American surfers said they had a very good time in the bathing resort of the DPRK with fascinating scenery and a refreshing environment,' it added. NK News has also confirmed that independent tour companies are now operating newly-organised excursions in the country. At this point, however, the tours haven't been confirmed to be available to tourists domestically and it seems likely that visitors are required to bring their own equipment. 'There have been two surfing groups so far,' Beijing-based Koryo Tours employee Simon Cockerell told NK News. 'Basically no special permission is needed as the places they go are places that are already open to tourists.' The news of expanded surf tourism comes after North Korean efforts to gradually open the country to visitors . In recent months, North Korea has displayed an interest in developing the country's east coast into a tourism hub, and targeting the foreign surfing community could prove just the ticket. Andrea Lee of US-based North Korea tour company Uri Tours told NK News: 'There is potential for a surfing market in the DPRK tourism space and we expect to offer such tours more regularly.' 'We understand that the eastern coast of the DPRK produces good, surfable waves during the months of April to September.'","Three east coast resorts have opened their doors to foreign tourists .

Only 6,000 tourists visit the Communist country each year and British photographer and filmmaker Rob Whitworth was one of them, as he was granted permission to make the movie. A collaboration between Mr Whitworth and JT Singh, a branding specialist focused on cities, has resulted in footage that offers a rare visual journey inside North Korea's capital - Pyongyang.

"By . Chris Kitching for MailOnline . Those aren’t shooting stars or UFOs screaming across the night sky. After a year of painstaking labour, 22-year-old Milton Tan has put together an incredible time-lapse video that shows planes taking off and landing at hyper speed at night. The 22-year-old filmmaker snapped more than 11,000 photos with two cameras when he was granted exclusive access to parts of Singapore Changi Airport. VIP access: 22-year-old Milton Tan was allowed to film from the runway area at Singapore Changi Airport . Tan spliced together 7,000 photos to create the three-and-a-half minute video called The Air Traffic 2. The result is an enthralling video that captures the hectic pace of one of the busiest airports in the world. Tan was granted access to a restricted area of the runway during the summer of 2013 after airport personnel were wowed by one of his earlier time-lapse films. He spent two days snapping thousands of photos as flights landed and took off almost every minute during peak hours. Hyper speed: A plane streaks across the sky in Milton Tan's enthralling time-lapse video . He said on his blog: ‘I was so close to the planes that my cameras literally got shaken by the rumbles from the jet engines, which actually produced a pretty neat effect. ‘It was a thrilling experience as you don't usually get to enter the restricted runway area, let alone shoot in it.’ Tan describes the scenes in his time-lapse film as a ‘sci-fi world with shooting stars breaking into the atmosphere’. He said the shots were taken at four- to ten-second exposures and at zero-second intervals, meaning the shutter opens again to snap another photo immediately after closing. That ensures that the lights from the planes move smoothly through the frame, Tan explained.

"By . Rebecca Brett . A father who was fined for taking his daughter out of school for a family holiday, has quit his job to avoid it happening again. Plymouth City Council fined Jason Short £120 for taking seven-year-old Madeleine on holiday to Turkey in June, during the only time he was allowed to take off work. He claims he had explained the situation to teachers at Salisbury Road Primary School in Plymouth and was told not to worry but was later hit with the fine. Scroll down for video . Plymouth City Council fined Jason Short £120 for taking seven-year-old Madeleine on holiday to Turkey in June . He returned home after the break to find he had a letter from the council stating he would be fined for taking Madeleine out of school without permission. Now the 41-year-old salesman will leave his role at the Vospers car dealership so that he can take his family away during the school holidays. 'It's not the only reason, but it is one of the reasons, I want a family life and my job is not centred around school holidays' he told the Plymouth Herald. Mr Short is also considering a career change in order to have a better work/life balance. He said the new role, working with his brother in the property market pays less but will also mean he pay less tax. He continued to say that if he gets fined for taking his daughter on holiday again, he will 'cause a fuss' by counting the money out in one pound coins and presenting it to the council. Despite Mr Short discussing their break with teachers, the family found the fine when they returned home from the holiday. The letter stated that they would be fined £60 for taking Madeleine out of school without permission and this would go up to £120 if not paid by a certain date. Video courtesy of the Shropshire Star . Previously head teachers could grant permission for families to take children out of school in 'special circumstances', but in September last year this changed to 'exceptional circumstances' (posed by models) Mr Short eventually decided to pay the fine to avoid ending up in court as he was worried he would end up with a criminal record which could affect his job prospects. A Plymouth City Council spokeswoman said: 'Parents should always seek permission from the head teacher to take their children out of school in the term time. 'This applied before September 2013 as well as after, although the new government regulations which came in meant head teachers could no longer grant holidays during term time in ""special circumstances"", only ""exceptional circumstances"" which are classed as unavoidable causes such as illness or exclusions. 'As a result we have seen more referrals from schools which resulted in fines. 'We adopted a zero tolerance policy so that there was consistency across the authority and ensured that all our head teachers, schools and governing bodies supported this approach.'","Jason Short was fined £120 for taking daughter Madeleine out of school .

"By . Katie Amey for MailOnline . Sunseekers could pay for an extra two days of their holiday simply by haggling when they buy goods abroad. Tourists who are happy to barter can save up to £118.80 on meals, souvenirs, and day-trips during a week-long getaway, according to new research, which is enough to pay for a full two more days. The best holiday hagglers are located in Northern Ireland, the North-West and Wales, with Belfast, Cardiff and Liverpool crowned the Bartering Brit capitals of the UK. Smart shopper: Britons are advised that they can save £118 by haggling on their holidays . The most resistant are holidaymakers in the South East. Southampton and Brighton shoppers are least likely to haggle. Holiday hagglers admit to bartering most often when they feel overcharged by inflated tourist prices, according to a new study. And one in three Brit travelers reckon they can save up to 28 per cent off the asking price. 1. Spain . 2. Turkey . 3. Greece . 4. Egypt . 5. Portugal . 1. Jewellery . 2. Souvenirs . 3. Clothes . 4. Handbags . 5. Ornaments . Spain is listed as the top country for bartering, with Britons more likely to get a discount on their goods. The Iberian peninsula surprisingly beat Turkey for its acceptance of haggling, which took second place, followed by Greece. Northern Irish travellers are the best hagglers, but those from Brighton don't fare so well . Egypt and Portugal also made it into the top five destinations for negotiating a bargain. Psychologist Dr Sandi Mann of the University of Central Lancashire explains: 'Many 'wannabe hagglers' are still put off by the traditionally British attitude that talking about money is rude.' 'Negotiating money off in any situation begins with a state of mine - and if you've had success on holiday, it gives you the confidence to bring those skills back with you.' 'Negotiating is a game and if you learn the rules abroad, it will become second nature in everyday life.' The Negotiation Academy was launched by webuyanycar.com at the start of 2014 with the aim of empowering the British public to buy better and save more. Dr Mann also listed her top tips for a successful haggling experience abroad. 1. First impressions: Never show that you love an item, always create the impression you quite like it, but you would need to be persuaded to part with cash. Always wait to be approached before starting your negotiation. In fact, it's a good idea to look as if you are about to walk away when they approach you. 2. Embrace 'tourist traps': On a packed street of restaurants or souvenir shops, you hold all the aces. Choose a quieter time when they are more desperate for customers, be bold and negotiate up front on what you are prepared to pay. 3. Brush up your acting skills: This is a game, so be prepared to play. Wait for an opening price, look shocked and start walking away. The stallholder might ask how much you are willing to pay - always answer with half the amount they first priced it at. 4. Choose your friends: Always smile and be pleasant, make friends - but don't get too friendly or you will start to feel sorry for the stallholder when he tells you his sob story about how little money he is making. 5. Mix up your tactics: If you're with a partner or friend, play good cop, bad cop where one enthuses over the item while the other points out its flaws. If you're with a small child, explain they are spending their pocket money and only have a small amount (if this is true - don't encourage deceitful behaviour in your kids!) 6. Language barrier: Turn any language barrier to your advantage by pretending you don't understand when they tell you exactly why the item is worth so much more than you want to pay. Just repeat your offer and look blankly at any attempts they might make at justifying their price.","Travelers can save up to £118.80 simply by bartering on meals and souvenirs .

"By . Craig Hope for the Daily Mail . Jake Livermore may liken Hull to a ‘big village’, but an entire continent awaits should they reverse a 1-0 deficit against Sporting Lokerenon Thursday night. The 24-year-old, who made his loan move from Tottenham permanent in the summer for a fee of £8million, was a frustrated spectator seven days ago in Belgium as his team-mates slipped to a first-leg defeat, goalkeeper Allan McGregor gifting Hans Vanaken a second-half winner. Livermore is likely to start on Thursday evening, with Steve Bruce to name a strong side in a bid to reach the group stages in Hull’s first entry into Europe. Prepared: Jake Livermore (right) insists Hull are ready for Europe ahead of the play-off against Lokeren . ‘Hull’s like a big village, everyone is in it together,’ said Livermore. ‘You are politely reminded all the time what a big achievement this is for the club and the city. Equally, it’s right they know it’s a massive step for the players as well. ‘Everybody comes here with a fire in their belly and we are all pushing together. I don’t think any club in the country has progressed more over the last two years than Hull.’ The Tigers took four points from their first two Premier League matches and travel to Aston Villa on Sunday. Bruce completed the £3m signing of defender Michael Dawson from Spurs this week and is set to bring in Uruguayan striker Abel Hernandez for a club record £9.5m from Palermo. And Livermore is confident that Hull have the squad to compete on both European and domestic fronts. ‘Some say travelling is a hindrance but we don’t mind,’ he said. ‘It’s a young, growing squad and if any club is right to do it (play in the Europa League) it’s us.’ Working hard: Livermore trains with former Spurs pair Tom Huddlestone and new boy Michael Dawson (centre)","Jake Livermore likely to start for Hull against Lokeren in Europa League play-off at the KC stadium .

The actress and model, who already has her own lingerie line under her belt, has just been unveiled as the face of another brand. The 26-year-old is Moroccanoil's first ever famous face and shows off her glossy, flowing hair in the new campaign imagery. Another coup: Rosie Huntington-Whiteley's career is going from strength to strength. Her latest feat? Starring as the face and glossy hair of Moroccanoil's latest campaign . The advertisements run with the tag line 'Inspired' and the ethos behind the campaign is to celebrate and empower women around the world, and not not only in the glossy hair stakes. A short-film series to accompany the campaign will soon be unveiled, which features Rosie revealing her own inspirations, along with powerful stories from five other women. Rosie recently opened up about her looks in an interview with Industrie magazine explaining why it's important for her to be more than a pretty face. 'I realised early on that nothing lasts forever, especially as a model - you have to build something for yourself from it. Looks go and you fade. Modelling is short lived,' she said. 'I wanted something for when I want to take a back seat. There'll be a brand that I'll be sitting at the helm of and enjoying. This is really the start of something I see as a long-term thing.'

"By . David Charlesworth, Press Association . Hull boss Steve Bruce believes any side he chooses to field against Lokeren will be capable of overturning a 1-0 deficit in their Europa League play-off second leg - but has urged his players to show patience. Bruce made wholesale changes for the opening encounter against the Belgian team last week but an uncharacteristic error from goalkeeper Allan McGregor led to the Tigers facing an uphill task on Thursday evening. Despite the setback at the Daknamstadion, Bruce is once again prepared to shuffle his pack as he contemplates having to juggle a squad on both domestic and European fronts this season. Hoping: Steve Bruce believes Hull can overturn a 1-0 deficit against Lokeren in their Europa League play-off . That dilemma will only occur if his side can come from behind and defeat Lokeren to reach the group stages of the competition, although Bruce is supremely confident. 'We've got a squad of depth which I'm very, very comfortable with. We made wholesale changes last week, I don't think it's going to be as many this week but we'll certainly make a few,' Bruce said. 'It's quite simple, we've got to win the match and we're capable of that, no matter what line-up I pick, we're capable of winning the game. 'We know that we'd love to be in the next stages; to get in the group stages would be terrific for the club, we're aware of that. We're also aware of how difficult it is with all the pitfalls that come with it. 'We'll be going all out to try and get a result and get us through to the league situation which we'd all look forward to.' Settling in: New boy Michael Dawson trains with former Spurs duo Tom Huddlestone and Jake Livermore . Working hard: Following the arrival of Dawson, Bruce is very pleased with the squads depth at Hull this term . Bruce, however, is wary of his side taking Lokeren lightly and has warned them not to throw caution to the wind, as they did in the third qualifying round, when they had to come from a goal down against AS Trencin to progress. 'The one thing you can't be is gung ho,' Bruce said. 'They're good opposition, they've got some good players; you don't finish fifth in the Belgian league and win the (domestic) cup if you're not a good side. 'So of course you've got to have a bit of patience, you've got to have a bit of guile about you and if we leave ourselves exposed at the back then like we did against Trencin we'll concede after a minute.' However, Bruce was keen to add that they must dictate the tempo of the contest. 'It's vitally important that we play at a level which we're comfortable with and the one thing about the Premier League to other leagues is the pace, the tempo, the quickness to it is the main difference,' he said. Done deal: Dawson becsmr Hull City's sixth summer signing as Steve Bruce tries to deepen his squad . 'So we've got play at our pace to make sure that we are on the front foot against them.' Hull received a boost ahead of the clash on Tuesday night with the signing of Michael Dawson from Tottenham although the defender will be ineligible to make his bow against Lokeren. Bruce, though, believes the 30-year-old's experience whilst he was with Spurs will prove invaluable during the season as Hull once again attempt to remain in the Premier League. 'He's a quality player who's played at the highest level in the Premier League for the last seven or eight years,' Bruce added. 'All of the ingredients in what he brings to the table was the reason why we brought him here. 'It's going to be difficult in the second season. 'So the additions of people like himself can only help the cause. We're trying to move the thing forward and trying to get a bigger and better squad because it's a long season ahead with many games to play and when a quality addition like him becomes available we're delighted to get him.'","Steve Bruce confident Hull can overcome Lokeren in Europa League play-off .

The accolade for Europe's top player in the 2013-14 season will be handed out during the draw for the Champions League group stage. Sportsmail takes a look at the three nominees, and why they are up for the coveted award. Sweeper keeper: Manuel Neuer is the best goalkepeer  in the world and is up for the coveted award .

Penalties Saved: 0 . Manuel Neuer . The undisputed best goalkeeper in the world has had quite a year. At club level Bayern Munich swept the board domestically, winning the league and cup double. Of course, Pep Guardiola's side failed to retain their Champions League title - but the Germans were defeated by eventual winners Real Madrid. But it is at international level where Neuer excelled. His performances in Brazil during Germany's World Cup triumph were quite brilliant, merely underlining his position as the planet's best. His 'goalsweeping' style was a feature of Brazil 2014 - in essence acting like a 12th man for his team. He may have left Joachim Low with his heart in his mouth a few times but it was certainly effective. 12th outfield player: Neuer spends so much time out of his box that he often plays like a defender .

Pass Accuracy: 82.4% . Arjen Robben . Yes, he is a serial diver - but there's no denying the Dutchman is one of the most effective attacking players in Europe. Technically there's not many better, but where he differs from others is that there is almost always an end product - 22 goals from wide is no mean feat. His performance against Manchester United in the quarter-final second leg was breathtaking. His performances in the World Cup weren't bad either - particularly in that 5-1 demolition of Spain in the group stages. Holland finished third in Brazil, and much of their run was down to Robben. He just needs to cut out the diving! Hotshot: Arjen Robben scored 22 goals  last season, including three for Holland at the World Cup . Diver?

There isn't an awful lot more you can say about this guy, who was by far and say the best player in the world last season. 51 goals and 15 assists in a single season tells its own story. Lionel Messi's injury-hit campaign thrust Ronaldo even more into the limelight and the Portuguese thrived on the attention. There wasn't a more potent attacking force than Ronaldo last season - his shirtless celebration following his late penalty in the Champions League final win over local rivals Atletico Madrid was one of the most memorable moments of last season. It was a shame, however, that he couldn't carry that form into the World Cup as Portugal crashed out in the group stages. You can't have everything, though.

"By . Martha De Lacey . Normally the drama happens on the stage, not in the wings. Not so in Covent Garden, where opera director Laurent Pelly has swapped the leading lady in his production of Giacomo Meyerbeer's epic opera Robert le diable just three days before opening night. American singer Jennifer Rowley has been dismissed in favour of Italian soprano Patrizia Ciofi, who flew in to London from Paris only yesterday to take over the role of Princess Isabelle. Jennifer Rowley has been replaced by Italian soprano Patrizia Ciofi in the Royal Opera House production of Giacomo Meyerbeer's epic opera Robert le diable . The decision was made during the final rehearsals, and an official ROH statement explained it was based on a 'mutual' belief that  the role of Isabelle would 'not be right' for Rowley's Covent Garden debut. The last minute swap follows a spate of disruptive cast changes: Rowley was herself a replacement for original casting of Isabelle, German soprano Diana Damrau, who was forced to leave the production in June when she fell pregnant. Ciofi on stage at the Royal Opera House in La Fille du Regiment by Donizetti and directed by Laurent Pelly in April . The role of Princess Isablelle will now be played by Patrizia Ciofi, right, on all nights in Covent Garden apart from the final two, 18 and 21 Decmber, when Russian singer Sofia Romina will take over part . The opera is a supernatural romance set within the courts of medieval France. Ciofi will play Isablle on all . performances apart from 18 and 21 December when he role will be . performed by Russian Sofia Romina, herself a newcomer to the Royal Opera House. The Royal Opera House explained: . 'After much deliberation and consultation following the final rehearsals . of Meyerbeer's Robert le diable, it has been agreed between The Royal . Opera and soprano Jennifer Rowley that the role of Isabelle would not be . the right part for her debut at Covent Garden. 'The Royal Opera considers Jennifer Rowley an important voice of the . future, and we are keen to build a continued relationship with her. 'However, voices do develop, and we have to recognize that this role is . not ideally suited for her now more dramatic voice. 'Despite all efforts . until the last minute by all parties to make it work as well as . possible, it has been mutually agreed that Jennifer Rowley will not . appear in Robert le diable and will postpone her Covent Garden debut. 'The Royal Opera is proud to announce that it has been agreed that she . will return in 2015 in her celebrated role of Musetta in La bohème, and . another important role is under discussion for the future.' As well as the commotion surrounding the role of Isabelle, Marina Poplavskaya withdrew from her part as Alice due to a medical condition, returning later when no alternative could be found. Patrizia Ciofi took the role of Marie in the Royal Opera production of La Fille du Regiment by Donizetti, directed by Laurent Pelly, in April this year . Laurent Pelly's production of Giacomo Meyerbeer's opera opens on Thursday and runs until 21 December . After a number of unhappy people commented on the website about then change, specifically asking why Ciofi had not been chosen to replace Damrau back in June, the ROH added: 'We are sorry that the cast change causes disappointment. 'Patrizia Ciofi wasn't originally available to replace Diana Damrau, as she was not available for the rehearsal period, but we are extremely grateful to her for having jumped in with such short notice immediately after ending her last engagement in Avignon. 'We do of course take full responsibility for believing wholeheartedly in this casting six months ago, and I am sorry that the change now has caused disappointment and irritation. 'We still are very excited about Jennifer Rowley's voice, and we look very much forward to presenting Jennifer Rowley as Musetta - a role she has received much deserved acclaim for - and are discussing another significant role with her, as stated above. 'As for ROH having many last minute cast changes, I do agree that we have been particularly unlucky in the last year with too many cast changes, most of them due to illness or other circumstances beyond our control. 'We are very sorry for this, and I do assure you it is something that we never announce with a light heart. We will do all we can to prevent this and hopefully will have fewer cast changes in the future.' Comments on the Royal Opera House website reveal that fans have mixed feelings about the last-minute cast change... 'I am shocked and very disappointed. This is a very big mistake. It is . sad that people of London and around the world will not hear Miss Rowley . in this roll [sic] this year at your house!!' Mike . 'I hope all this annoying cast changing will not influence the planned . future DVD release that is announced on the website.

But as the shoot progresses it becomes a strip-tease, with each image showing Scott in a further state of undress, until he is completely naked. Speaking about his debut cover shoot, he told Vogue Paris: 'It's amazing because I never see myself in this way.' When . asked about posing in the nude, he added: 'It was more towards the end . of the day, and it was talked about a lot, but I thought: ""I'll do it . anyway.""' Finely honed: Scott was scouted by a photographer whilst on holiday in the Philippines (picture shows a shoot for FTAPE.com) One writer at FashionCopious was quick to comment: 'I mean what straight guy, myself included, would be attracted to a cover like this; or would want to see Jarrod Scott's penis?' Twitter users were also shocked, with journalist Grace Dent tweeting: my EYES, MY EYES!' after spotting the shoot. Another tweet read: 'Jarrod Scott @FordModels looking like that on the cover of Vogue Hommes Intl is hurting my feelings.' Twitter reaction: The Twittersphere were shocked and impressed in equal measure . The Fashion Law tweeted: 'I wonder how much Jarrod Scott got paid to go completely naked for the latest Vogue Hommes International.' Scott+, who is of Italian/German decent, broke into the modelling industry after being scouted by a photographer while on holiday in the Philippines. He launched his international modelling career walking for Givenchy AW12 in January and has since shot Vogue Hommes International with David Sims with many tipping him for great success this year.

"By . Anna Edwards . AND KELLY STRANGE . Terminally ill with lung cancer, Lisa Russell vowed to give her two daughters the best year of their lives. The 37-year-old dinner lady and her partner Anthony got married and blew their savings on three luxury family holidays. Lisa even planned her own funeral and wrote goodbye letters for her daughters to open after she died. Lisa was told she had terminal lung cancer and was given only 18 months to live. Pictured with husband Anthony, daughters Chloe and Georgia (left) she spent her savings on holidays to make memories for the family . Lisa, pictured having her head shaved off after beginning treatment, was told that her tumour had shrunk . But three years after the diagnosis, Lisa's death sentence was lifted — as her cancer unexpectedly disappeared. The mother, who had already undergone a hysterectomy to beat cervical cancer, said: 'I’d been saying goodbye and preparing for the end. It was heartbreaking to tell my daughters Mummy was going to die. 'I was very young when I lost my mother. The thought of them growing up without me was devastating. 'Telling them I wasn't going anywhere was the best moment of my life.' When Lisa, from Oldham, got a chesty cough she put it down to smoking ten cigarettes a day. Only when it failed to shift in 2009 did she visit her GP. She was diagnosed with small cell lung cancer (SCLC) — unrelated to her earlier illness and rare in a woman her age. It's 94 per cent death rate is one of cancer's highest. Lisa was told her cancer was inoperable — but that chemotherapy could give her another 18 months with her family. Lisa's biggest fear was that her girls, Chloe and Georgia — then 13 and eight — would not remember her. The best gift ever: Lisa was thrilled to tell her daughters that the cancer tumour had shrunk and doctors could not longer find it . Lisa was determined to make sure her daughters remembered her, after she grew up without a mother and father as they passed away when she was young . Lisa and Anthony with their daughters on their wedding day, which they organised in six weeks after learning of the dinner lady's condition . She says: 'I hated the thought of my kids having their childhood without a mother, like I had. 'I was only five when she took her own life after battling depression. I only had one photo of my mum. 'Then, when I was 13, my dad died of a heart attack. I was raised by my wonderful older siblings. 'They gave me a great childhood but I still missed having a mum. I was distraught to think my children would forget me. 'I didn’t want history to repeat itself so I vowed to create as many wonderful memories for my daughters as possible.' Knowing she would lose her hair during treatment, Lisa organised a sponsored head shave on her 34th birthday, raising £4,000 for The Christie Hospital in Manchester, where she was being treated. She vowed to spend her money on creating happy memories for her daughters with her partner Anthony, spending £2,000 on a holiday to Lanzarote, £3,000 on a break in Bulgaria and £6,000 on a luxurious trip to Turkey. Lisa, seen here in Turkey with her daughter, says she has learned the importance of living life to the full after enduring cancer twice . They married - with their daughters watching their father propose - and spent £4,000 on their ceremony. In January 2010, Lisa and Anthony, from Oldham, flew to Lanzarote on a belated honeymoon — again taking the girls with them. 'We splashed out on a luxury villa using our wedding present money and savings. 'It was impossible to forget about the cancer but seeing the girls play in the sea and play on the beach was fantastic. 'Again, I knew they were memories they would never forget and I wanted to create more.' Todl by a consultant that there was no hope for a recovery, Lisa booked another holiday to Bulgaria in May 2010, costing £4,000. Lisa took her family to Turkey to stay at a five star resort, spending £6,000 on the luxury holiday. She says that she does not mind spending so much because the family came away with happy memories . Lisa, pictured with her husband, moments before having her hair shaved off. The dinner lady says she just wanted to spend time with her family before she died . With Anthony working as an electrician and Lisa unable to work, money was tight. But the couple vowed to blow what little they had left making memories for the girls. Lisa says: 'You don’t care about money when you are dying, just your family spending time together. 'I didn't want their memories of me to be in hospital. I wanted them to be happy, carefree memories.' They spent more money on meals with friends and days out with the girls — before splashing out another £6,000 on a five-star, all-inclusive break in Turkey in September, 2010. Lisa says: 'It was the trip of a lifetime. I knew they'd never forget it.' By the time she returned home, Lisa had already lived past the 18-month prognosis. She continued to have check-ups every three months without any change in the outlook. Lisa wrote goodbye letters to her daughters and husband, telling them how much she loved them and assuring them she would always watch over them. She tucked them away with instructions to be opened after her death. Lisa says: 'I wanted them to know I would always be with them, regardless.' But her words were to come true in a way she could never have imagined. The mother was diagnosed with small cell lung cancer after beating cervical cancer, a condition that is rare in a woman her age . Told by a consultant that there was no hope for a recovery, Lisa booked holidays and wrote goodbye letters to her children and husband . Lisa, pictured here with Georgia, in London, waa raised by her older siblings after her parents died when she was a child . In April last year — three years after her original diagnosis — she went for a routine biopsy — and was given the astonishing news that her tumour had shrunk so much the doctors couldn’t find it. 'My mouth fell wide open,' she recalls. 'I couldn’t believe it. The doctors couldn’t either. My death sentence had been lifted. 'Nobody could predict this would happen. Everyone at The Christie Hospital was amazing. I can’t thank them enough. Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is a . fast-growing type of lung cancer and spreads much more quickly than . non-small cell lung cancer. About 15 per cent of all lung cancer cases are SCLC, according to the U.S. National Library of Medicine. It is slightly more common in men than women. Symptoms include bloody phlegm, chest pain, a cough, loss of appetite, shortness of breath, weight loss and wheezing. 'I can’t believe how lucky I am. I was just laughing and said to my husband, ‘Thank goodness we still have a few quid left, because I’m not dying’. 'The funny thing is, I never really felt ill apart from when I was having treatment. It was the chemotherapy that made me feel sick and tired.' Later, she revealed the good news to her daughters. She says: 'They asked for the letters I wrote when I was dying but I said no. It was too painful. 'My youngest said if I wasn’t dying, they didn't need an ""I'm sorry I died"" card any more. 'I burst out laughing. Typical of kids to put things so bluntly. I’m still laughing because I feel so lucky. Only six per cent of SCLC patients survive. 'When my daughters were born, I promised them I would always be there — and I intend to keep that promise. I’ve beaten cancer twice now. 'Anthony was made redundant recently so we could have done with the money now. But I don’t regret what we did. 'Being told I was dying taught me how short life can be — it needs to be lived.' A spokesperson for the Christie Hospital said: 'Lisa has done incredibly well. Everybody here at Christie's is delighted for her. 'There is of course always a risk that the cancer could come back so we are keeping a very close eye on her.'","Lisa Russell spent her savings on her wedding and holidays to Bulgaria, Turkey and Lanzarote .

"By . Lucy Waterlow . The image of the perfect housewife who kept a spotless home, had her husband's dinner ready as soon as he walked through the door from work and single-handed raised the children - while still always managing to look fashionable and beautiful - is a well-known stereotype from the 1950s. Media, advertising and role models like Barbara Cartland all served to enforce the view that the place for post-World-War-Two women was in the home. So what was life like for these women who were expected to achieve with aplomb, and without complaint, the part of domestic goddess? Immaculate look: January Jones, left, plays perfect housewife Betty Draper in Mad Men but many real women of the era wouldn't have had time to look as groomed as she does . Drawing from her own experiences and those of other women from the time, grandmother and historian Sheila Hardy from Suffolk reveals the daily reality in her book '1950s Housewife Marriage And Homemaking In The 1950s'. Just reading the list of chores that had to be carried out every day as outlined in one chapter will make modern women need a lie down (in a bed easily made thanks to the invention of the duvet and fitted sheets, luxuries 50s housewives didn't have). How to make the bed alone with the layering of sheets takes up a number of pages and this was not a task to be shirked: 'It was a slatternly housewife indeed who left her bed unmade throughout the day,' Hardy writes. Duty: Women were expected to get up and make their husband's breakfast, even if they had a job of their own to get to . Then there was breakfast, lunch and dinner to be cooked, laundry and ironing to be done and trips to the shops to be made. Fifties housewives wouldn't get everything need under one supermarket roof but would instead visit 'their own parade of local shops, which would have included a post office, butcher, greengrocer, grocer, newsagent, baker and dairy. In many places there would also have been a fishmonger, possibly a fried fish shop, and invariably a draper who also sold knitting wool, and a chemist.' Hardy writes that at the time: 'Books, magazines, films and, later, television programmes tried hard to reinforce the idyllic picture of the perfect stay-at-home housewife who took care of the home, raised the children, cooked nutritious meals, and provided a haven of calm for her hardworking husband when he returned at the end of his working day.' They were also encouraged to look the part when their husband returned from work, ensuring they had 'bathed, perfumed and dressed in smart clean clothes, complete with fresh frilly apron, ready to spend a cosy and possibly romantic evening with him.' But she says in reality it was impossible for women to meet this ideal. Making a bed in the days before duvets and fitted sheets: 'It was a slatternly housewife indeed who left her bed unmade' 'They would have their husband's evening . meal ready but it was doubtful if they would have had time to run a . comb through their hair, let alone wash their face and apply make-up,' she writes. She adds: The women who might take Miss Cartland’s advice or heed that given in magazines were those who most probably had some help in the house. If all your washing went to the laundry from whence everything, including your husband’s shirts, returned beautifully ironed, and if you had an obliging Mrs Mopp who came, perhaps not every day but certainly more than once a week, to scrub, clean and polish, then like Mrs Dale whose diary was broadcast daily, you too could strive to be the perfect housewife.' Despite the idea that all women at the time were homemakers, many in fact were juggling their homes with jobs of their own. Hardy said career women who do this today with the help of appliances like vacuum cleaners and dishwashers have it easy compared to their predecessors. 'Modern women complain of pressure, but many 1950s women worked and still came home to do the domestic chores,' she said. But while sexism and inequality was rife, Hardy said not all housewives were 'downtrodden doormats' but were 'tough and ultra-organised'. While the men may have earned the money, they took charge of how it was spent balancing the household finances with military precision. 'The vast majority of stay-at-home wives were given a sum from their husband's weekly pay packet and were expected to run the house, and feed and clothe themselves and later the children, out of it,' she writes. Sheila Hardy's book reveals what life was really like in the 50s . 'In some households the man handed over his unopened pay packet to his wife who then gave him back what amounted to his pocket money. 'Others allotted varying amounts into tins or jars to cover the rent, bills for the utilities, insurance policies or to pay regular installments on essential items, such as the gas cooker. 'Another receptacle was earmarked for storing the shilling pieces needed to feed the gas and electricity meters.' Hardy reproduces list of household items made by women of the time and receipts that were kept to keep books balanced in her book, offering a unique insight into the lives lived by families decades ago. Aside from the domestic lives of women in the 50s, Hardy's book also looks at the popular fashions. As like today, magazines such as Vogue were a port of call for anyone seeking the latest fashion advice and the Queen and her sister Princess Margaret were style icons along with actresses Doris Day and Grace Kelly. Women were able to make the most of the increased availability of fabrics like nylon and no outfit was considered complete without hat and gloves. Hardy writes: 'For summer the hat would have been close fitting: a Juliet-style cap, or a simple stiffened band some 5in or 6in wide in a material that matched or toned with the dress.' She adds: Gloves were considered much more than simply items to keep your hands warm in winter. The 1950s women had been brought up by mothers who considered that ‘no lady left the house without her gloves on – not put on as she walked down the street – but put on in the hall before she checked in the hall mirror that she was fit to face the world!’ As they couldn't afford to buy new dresses very often, 50s women were encouraged to make do and mend and creating dresses from patterns was the norm.

"By . Bianca London . The Duchess of York joined Cherie Blair to honour Asian women overcoming obstacles in business, the workplace, sports and culture at the Asian Women of Achievement Awards 2013 last night. Dressed in a traditional yet glamorous purple sari with an embellished piece of head jewellery, Sarah Ferguson most certainly looked the part as she celebrated 13 women recognised for their outstanding careers. She was joined at London's Hilton Park Lane hotel by awards patron Cherie Blair, Princess Badiya bint El Hassan and Maria Miller MP. Sarah Ferguson, the Duchess of York, really looked the part as she attended the Asian Women of Achievement Awards 2013 last night . The most prestigious accolade of the evening went to Sue Kukadia, director of global immigration at Ernst & Young, who took home the RBS AWA Chairman’s Award. The Entrepreneurial Asian Woman of Achievement Award was taken home by Sipra Deb, who launched a Sheffield-based family play centre after overcoming the tragic murder of her father and leaving her career as a molecular biologist. Awards patron Cherie Blair also attended the prestigious event at London's Hilton Park Lane hotel . Ishrat Bano, a Postdoctoral Researcher at the University of Cambridge, was awarded the Professional Asian Woman of Achievement Award for her contributions to science, amongst many other winners. The awards evening was founded by India-born author and entrepreneur Pinky Lilani OBE back in 1999. Held in association with The Royal Bank of Scotland, the Asian Women of Achievement awards have quickly become the most important and established programme to recognise the contribution of Asian women to Britain’s economy and society. The awards evening was founded by India-born author and entrepreneur Pinky Lilani OBE back in 1999 . Pinky Lilani said: 'There is a growing confidence, positivity and youth about the new generation of Asian women achievers in Britain. 'When I started the Asian Women of Achievement awards in 1999, Asian women often worked away from the mainstream, accomplishing in their local communities, in niche industries, and a long way from the spotlight. Held in association with The Royal Bank of Scotland, the Asian Women of Achievement awards have quickly become the most important and established programme to recognise the contribution of Asian women to Britain's economy and society . 'Today, Asian women occupy positions of influence and power at the heart of British business, politics and society. I am delighted that the Asian Women of Achievement Awards continue to recognise the brightest and best, and that we can come together to celebrate the achievements of these amazing women.' Chris Sullivan, Chief Executive, RBS Corporate Banking, added: 'This year's winners of the Asian Women of Achievement Awards have exhibited success, verve and tenacity, and provide inspiration to us all, and we hope in particular to future generations of Asian women to fulfill their potential. Asian women overcoming obstacles in business, the workplace, sports and culture were honoured at the Asian Women of Achievement Awards 2013 last night . 'RBS aims to promote diversity and encourage debate about how to nurture talent wherever it is found through direct support on the ground, for example, meeting the needs of women start-ups, to looking at how  businesses can develop more diverse leadership teams and boards. 'We are proud to support these awards which showcase the often unsung achievements of Asian women.'

"By . Ruth Styles . Picture the scene. A small, visibly distressed girl asks to speak to her teacher the day after she returns from a holiday in Somalia. The teacher listens as the girl explains what has happened to her: her clitoris removed, her legs bound together. Terrible pain, no anaesthetic. Her teacher's shocking response: 'That's nice dear. A bit like a Bar Mitzvah.' For the young Nimko Ali, any hope of help had gone. Campaigner: Survivor Nimko Ali has spoken out about why FGM shouldn't be written off as a cultural issue . Speaking out: Somali supermodel Waris Dirie underwent FGM as a child and campaigns against it . A quarter of a century on and Ali remains furious but is determined to ensure that no other child will be left to suffer in silence as she did. 'It's easy to believe that this sort of thing only happens in other countries and cultures, but the reality is it's happening here in Britain,' she explains. 'For too long, it has been passed off as a ""cultural"" ritual. But this act is not about celebration. FGM is gender-based violence, it's as simple as that. The practice tells women that they are merely ""vessels"" to carry children; they deserve no sexual pleasure. 'I've now made it my quest to stand up and fight against FGM.' And her help is most certainly needed. Despite being illegal in the UK, FGM or female genital mutilation, is on the rise with an estimated 66,000 women dealing with the after-effects and more than 20,000 young girls thought to be at risk. Worldwide, more than three million women have been subjected to FGM, many of whom come from East African countries such as Uganda, Kenya and Somalia. Those countries, many of which are part of the Commonwealth, are at the heart of Britain's FGM problem, and as a result, the majority of British women to suffer FGM are part of the UK's 600,000-strong ethnic African community. When people fled from Al Shabab in Somalia or Idi Amin in Uganda, many came to the UK - bringing with them local traditions, including FGM. But East Africa isn't the only place where the practice is widespread. Women in Saudi Arabia, Indonesia, Yemen and others are also highly likely to be forced to undergo FGM. Although it is illegal to take a girl abroad for FGM under British law, Ali was just seven years old when she was taken to Somalia for a 'holiday' where she would be subjected to the horrific procedure. 'Towards the end of the holiday, we took a two-day drive through the desert, arriving eventually at a huge house,' remembers Ali. 'There was a woman at the door in a burka. I was scared and instinctively started running. When I was caught, I was taken into a room filled with instruments I didn't recognise. 'The woman I was so afraid of was there waiting for me. She scolded me for running away, telling me how difficult it was to obtain equipment like this; how ungrateful I was. 'I blacked out before she started cutting. I'm still not sure whether it was the anaesthetic or pure fear.' Barbaric: A collection of knives, blades and amulet used for female circumcision in Kenya's Pokot district (left). Nine-year old Fay Mohammed pictured days after undergoing FGM at home in Mogadishu (right) When Ali awoke, it was to find herself . in agony with her legs bound together. Although she was taken home to . the UK two days later, Ali found that friends and teachers were . unwilling to take her story seriously, leaving her feeling let down and . alone. Twenty two years later, Ali launched a charity, Daughters of Eve, with fellow FGM survivors Leyla Hussain and Sainab Abdi. Change: Home Secretary Theresa May has pledged tougher rules in order to stamp out FGM in the UK . The trio travel the length and breadth of the UK, raising awareness and encouraging people to pressurise the Government into stopping the practice once and for all. Although FGM has been illegal in the UK since 1985, there hasn't been a single conviction, despite overwhelming evidence that it still happens. 'Since I started campaigning, I've heard harrowing stories from girls all over England,' says Ali. 'The young woman who, after refusing FGM when she was taken to Egypt on a visit, endured beatings for the duration of the two week stay, and whose mother poured acid on her vagina when she was sleeping after they returned to England to gain a similar effect. 'A white English woman from Cornwall who came to tell us that she didn't previously have a name for what her dad did to her when she was 14, which was sew her up because she told him she was gay.' Home Secretary Theresa May confronted the issue during a parliamentary debate on the issue earlier this year. 'Sadly, what we see are too many examples of this terrible crime continuing to take place,' she said. 'I think most people would be shocked to know how many young girls within the United Kingdom are subjected to female genital mutilation. 'We need to redouble our efforts to make sure we educate young girls about the prospects of being taken abroad or having this done to them, but also ensure that we educate others not to do this terrible act.' The Home Secretary's efforts cannot come soon enough for Ali and girls like her who, Ali says, will likely endure lasting psychological and physical damage as a result of the mutilation. 'What I went through as a seven-year-old has stayed with me,' she says. 'But I have been lucky. There are girls who are crippled by depression and anxiety, traumatised by what has happened to them and those that will never enjoy sex, and never find the strength to speak out. 'I want to help them all and let them know that they are not alone. Right now, they are victims. Soon, they'll be survivors.' Read the full interview in this week's Grazia.

"By . Fiona Macrae Science Correspondent . Under wraps: With gloves on, Madonna defies her 54 years . Forget crow's feet, grey hair and middle-age spread. What women really worry about is the state of their hands. Research has revealed that many fear it is their hands that betray their true age, with bulging veins, thinning skin and liver spots giving the game away. One in eight women surveyed said they are now more concerned about the condition of their hands than their face – and 36 per cent are equally worried about both. It's a problem that may be familiar to  celebrities such as Madonna, 54, who is  frequently photographed wearing gloves to hide her hands. Experts say that while there are injections and operations to rejuvenate the face, until recently little could be done for the hands. As a result, they provide one of the best clues as to a person's true age. The survey, for No7., found that liver spots top the list of worries about ageing hands, with many women attempting to hide the dark marks with make-up. Dermatologists point out that our hands are constantly exposed to everything from sunshine to detergent, and many people simply neglect to take care of them until it is too late. Hands also lack the fat and oils that help protect the face against some of the ravages of time. But Ash Mosahebi, of the British Association of Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons, said there are new techniques to help women disguise the signs of ageing on the hands. Hands of time: A close-up of the star's hands shows bulging veins . Substances can be injected to rehydrate dry, thinning skin, while injections of fat can plump out the hands and make bulging veins less obvious. Such procedures are relatively common in the US and are 'trickling across the Atlantic', he added. If that sounds too drastic, skin doctors advise wearing gloves when it is cold to prevent chapping and donning rubber gloves when doing household chores. Soap should be avoided and sunscreen worn outdoors. And it seems there is little time to be lost. A separate survey found that a woman's battle against ageing begins before she's 30. After spending their teens trying to look older than they really are, women finally become happy with their appearance in their early 20s. But at 29, they become more concerned about trying to look young again, the poll by Superdrug found.

"By . Ruth Styles . Once a rare sight, spotting a tattoo on a female ankle or shoulder has become an ubiquitous part of modern life. But as this stunning collection of photographs shows, getting inked isn't quite the modern phenomenon it's often thought to be. There's Pam Nash, a noted tattoo champion of the 1930s, having extra flowers added to the Japanese garden adorning her back, a Danish tattooist creating a delicate rose on a client's thigh and a 1930s film fan admiring the portrait of actor Gary Cooper etched onto her shoulder. The man responsible, hugely popular London tattooist George Burchett, also features in a photograph dating from 1936 which shows him creating a snake on a female client's leg. Film fan: A woman admires the fabulously detailed portrait of movie star Gary Cooper etched on her shoulder by 1930s tattooist, George Burnett . Intricate: This 1930s tattoo enthusiast boasts a body covered in a mix of religious scenes, dragons and flowers . Flirty: A heavily tattooed woman shows off her full body etchings while flirtatiously twirling her skirt . Portrait of an artist: Tattooist George Burchett, who also created the portrait of Gary Cooper on a client, works on a pattern encircling a client's thigh . But not every image is an innocent one. Poignantly, one portrait shows London prostitute Margaret McGowan who was found murdered in a Kensington car park on the 25th November, 1965. Her killer, a serial murderer dubbed Jack the Stripper, was never caught. Other colourful images show a tattooist creating a bluebird on a female client's breast, while another shows a woman covered from head to toe in markings flirtatiously twirling her skirt. While tattoos are a relatively recent phenomenon in Europe and the USA, body art has long been part of Polynesian culture and has also been found on the mummified remains of Ancient Egyptian priests and priestesses. Although tattoos first made an appearance in the woad etchings of Iron Age Britons, they didn't reappear in Western culture until the 19th century and the first recorded body art craze which originated in Victorian high society. Popularised by 19th century explorers returning home to the UK full of tales about the weird and wonderful tattooed women they saw on their travels, tattoos swiftly became the accessory of choice for upper class women. Such was the intensity of the craze for body art during the Victorian period, even Queen Victoria is believed to have had one in the form of a Bengal tiger fighting with a python. Oriental: Tattooist Les Skuse at work on champion tattoo lady, Pam Nash, who boasted a fabulously elaborate large Japanese scene across her back .

Sadly, tattoos didn't equal control for many Victorian women, some of whom were tattooed against their will and press-ganged into work as circus attractions. Others became tattoo artists themselves, including American Maud Wagner, the first known woman tattooist, who in 1904 traded a date with her tattooist husband-to-be for an apprenticeship and British tattooist Justine Knight who opened her London business in 1921. But while tattoos remained popular during the 1920s, their popularity waned in the wake of the Great Depression and the Second World War. Left to languish in the fashion wilderness for nearly 40 years, the tattoo next staged a comeback in the 1970s, when they were claimed by the nascent feminist movement before becoming part of the body-conscious beautifying of the 1980s and then gaining mainstream status in the 1990s.

"By . Bianca London . An artist has married the man of her dreams four years after painting his lookalike in a prophetic piece of artwork. In 2009, Chloe Mayo, who was single at the time, quickly dashed off an oil painting of her holding hands with a handsome, dark bearded man. Not thinking anything more of the creation, the 31-year-old left the painting to gather dust in the corner of her living room. Artist Chloe Mayo painted a picture of her perfect husband... only to later meet an identical real-life version . Because the oil painting was so uncannily similar to Michael, she hid the canvas under her bed in fear he thought she may have been stalking him, but he fell in love with it . In her search for love, Chloe joined an online dating website, and began messaging Michael Goeman, 30. Two months later the pair met - and Chloe was shocked to find Michael was the spitting image of the man in her painting. In fear of putting off her new lover, Chloe hid the uncanny painting under her bed, only revealing it once she had been on more dates with Michael. Thankfully, he was not put off by the painting and they continued their relationship for a further 18 months until he proposed while they were holidaying in the south of France. Three years after they first met, Chloe and Michael married, and the painting now has pride of place in the living room of the couple's home in Worcester Park near Croydon in Surrey. Chloe, a regulation manager for medical equipment, said: 'I had moved back to the UK after spending time working in Australia and the house needed brightening up. After dating for six weeks Chloe thought Michael's face looked familiar and then remembered her painting and realised he was the spitting image of the man she painted . 'I started painting some pictures to decorate the walls and I had a couple of ideas I wanted to incorporate. 'I wanted to create an image of a couple at nighttime but I didn't really have any set ideas, I just did what felt natural. 'I painted kisses coming off the trees so it looked romantic but the facial features on the people I actually added in last, I didn't intend for it to look like me with anyone. 'I didn't hang it up, I just left it in a pile in the corner of my lounge for weeks and forgot about it but after a night out with Michael I realised he looked just like the man. 'He was due to come over to my house and I thought that if he saw the picture he would think I was a stalker and a bit weird, so I hid it under my bed. 'About a week later I mustered up the courage to show him and although he looked a bit confused, he saw the funny side when I explained what had happened. The happy couple, who met online, now hang the painting on their wall and dub him 'the man in the painting' 'Now we have hung the picture up on the wall in the lounge and all our friends called Michael ""The man in the painting"". 'I never would have thought I'd have predicted my husband and I don't normally believe in that sort of thing, but I suppose it must be fate.'","In 2009 single Chloe Mayo painted herself holding hands with a man .

"By . Deni Kirkova . 'The tendency now is to consider drugs or operations as a quick fix if you are overweight', said Dr Ellie Cannon on the Lorraine show this morning. And a quick fix is exactly what Emrah Mevsimler was desperate for when he begged his mother Sharon for a gastric band operation at the age of just 13. 'I had tried to kill myself,' he told presenter Helen Fospero. 'I begged her to have the operation to change my life.' Emrah Mevsimler calls on obese teenagers to opt for exercise and healthy eating . Emrah, from Chelmsford, Essex, is now 18 and says he wants the procedure reversed. 'Over the years it stopped working and now it's causing me so much . trouble. 'I get in extreme unbearable pain which stops me from standing up. It's like really bad cramp that won't go away.' He now wants to warn other teenagers not to go down the same route as he did. 'Exercise should be the way - and schools should help. Fitness should be a priority.' Emrah became the youngest person in the UK to have a gastric band fitted in 2008. His family decided to take the drastic action after constant bullying about his weight led to a suicide attempt. His mother had spent most of her life struggling with her weight too and at one point had been dubbed Britain's most obese woman. Emrah said: 'The bullying was really bad, I couldn't . stand it,' he said. 'A gastric band was the only way at the time, what . they said was ruining my life.' 'I turned to food for comfort. After I . finished school, if I had money, I'd go and buy loads of sweets, go . home, eat them then cry.' At his heaviest, Emrah tipped the scales at 16 stone 8lbs at just 13 years old . Emrah pictured here with his family and mother Sharon, 'Britain's most obese woman' who passed in 2010 . 'Before I had my gastric band it was a . very difficult time for me at age 13. I tried to commit suicide, I . begged mum to have the operation to change my life.' 'She definitely realised she wanted to see me happy and not have to go through what she went through. 'At the time it was fantastic. I lost . weight, was so happy, regained my confidence, started socialising and . made loads of new friends.' Emrah's story first hit the headlines in 2010 after the death of his mother Sharon. Now aged 18, Emrah wishes he could turn . back the clock and is desperate to have the band removed to end the pain . he experiences daily. Emrah, a careworker for disabled children, has lived in almost constant agony for the past few years since he earned the dubious accolade of being the youngest person in the UK to be fitted with a gastric band. The controversial operation, which made national headlines, was performed in 2007 when he was only 13 and weighed 16st 8lb. Despite losing 4 stone in weight, the teenager is now calling for a worldwide ban on children having drastic anti‑obesity procedures. ‘I just wish it was out of me,’ he says. ‘I’ve been through hell because of it. I think every doctor should refuse to do them on anyone under 18. A gastric band is not the answer to curing an overweight child.’ Last year it was revealed that up to 20 children as young as 15 had invasive weight-loss surgery on the NHS in Britain. Added to this is the undocumented number of British children whose parents pay for the procedure privately, at a cost of between £5,000 and £8,000. Dr Ellie Cannon (left) says operations and drugs are now considered 'quick fixes' Many more children travel abroad with their parents to seek out cheap deals. Like Emrah, who had his operation in Belgium, many of these children haven’t even completed puberty when they go under the knife. The World Health Organisation has expressed concern over the use of bands in young people. Last year, a WHO report warned there had been little research into the use of these techniques on children, with their unique metabolic needs, concluding: ‘Surgical complications in this age group remain a concern.’ Gastric band surgery involves fitting a band near the top of the stomach, restricting the amount of food that can enter, thus making the patient feel full. Follow-up operations can adjust how much food is allowed to pass through. On Lorraine this morning, Dr Ellie Cannon, who joined Emrah on the sofa, said: 'A gastric band . is very much a last resort. Emrah is a very unusual case to have had . the operation at his age.' 'There is very strict criteria in the UK. Though the tendency now is to consider drugs or operations a 'quick fix' if you're overweight, . actually Emrah's story shows although it worked for him if we can teach . children and parents about lifestyle and exercise - although it's a . longer process - they'll be better off in the long term.' When Helen Fospero asked about Emrah's prospects if he has the band removed, whether he would be able to retain his figure, Dr Cannon said: 'Hopefully the behavioural change will stay and he should be able to carry that on.'

"By . Gemma Mullin for MailOnline . An architect whose girlfriend rushed into their blazing apartment in a bid to save his life has spoken of the moment he watched from above as paramedics desperately tried to resuscitate her. Oscar Silva, 30, had fallen asleep when his partner Sophie Rosser returned from a party and saw smoke billowing from their apartment building in the Isle of Dogs, East London. Fearing he was trapped in their fifth floor flat, the 23-year-old ran into the property but overcome by the flames she went into cardiac arrest and died in hospital later that day. Oscar Silva, 30, (left) with girlfriend Sophie Rosser, 23, who died trying to save him from fire at their flat in 2012 . Mr Silva, who moved to the UK from Nicaragua in 2005, told the Mirror: ‘She did what she did for me and that’s the worst thing to live with – the knowledge someone has given their life for you.’ Miss Rosser was unaware that her boyfriend had already got himself to safety on the balcony and began to fight her way upstairs. He then had to watch from above as paramedics battled to save her after she collapsed from the smoke. He said: ‘I slumped to the floor and watched as they lay her on the ground and spent ten minutes trying to save her. Sophie Rosser had returned from a party to her flat and noticed smoke billowing from the building . ‘All I could do was shout “That’s my Sophie”.’ Now a week before the second anniversary of her death, Mr Silva says he wishes to carry her legacy and live his life to the full as she had done. The couple met in 2009 when Mr Silva was working in a bar in London after he lost his job as an architect. Five years his junior, Cardiff-born Miss Rosser had inspired her boyfriend to keep trying and with her support he landed himself another job. Six-months into the relationship the pair decided to move in together and starting renting the flat where the tragedy happened. The couple would spend hours wandering around the capital, along the River Thames and capturing the memories with photographs. The night of the fire on August 26, 2012, Miss Rosser was at a friend’s birthday party in Chelsea. Mr Silva was due to meet her but was running late and decided to return to the flat instead. He says he sat up until 1am waiting for her to come home but had fallen asleep but was quickly jolted awake when she began ringing his phone. The young PA had returned to the building to see it in flames and called her boyfriend warning him to get out. Mr Silva and their housemate tried to escape down the stairs but were forced back by the flames and thick smoke. They ran back to the flat where he phoned Miss Rosser to tell her they would wait on the balcony but she did not answer. The fire at Meridian Place (pictured) was found to have been caused by a neighbour on the fourth-floor who had left a damp towel on a lamp. Miss Rosser did not know her boyfriend had got himself to safety on the balcony . Miss Rosser (pictured with boyfriend Mr Silva on a trip to Rome in 2011) was unaware that her boyfriend and their housemate had already got themselves to safety on the balcony when she rushed into the building . The pair met after Mr Silva moved to London from Nicaragua in 2005 to pursue a job as an architect but he lost his job and ended up working in a bar in London where he met young PA Sophie Rosser four years later . The couple would spend hours wandering around the capital and capturing the memories with photographs . She was already trying to make her way to him and warn their neighbours, but she was found collapsed on the fourth floor. Paramedics had managed to resuscitate her and she was taken to the Royal London Hospital where she was said to be in a stable condition. But later that day she suffered another cardiac arrest and died. Mr Silva has now moved from the flat he shared with his young girlfriend after he felt he could no longer stay there. The night of the fire on August 26, 2012, Miss Rosser was at a friend’s birthday party in Chelsea where her partner was due to attend but as he was already running late Mr Silva headed back to the flat and fell asleep .

He is continuing his life the way Miss Rosser would have wanted him to – pushing himself in his job and carries her camera everywhere taking pictures. Speaking after her inquest he said: 'She was a person with a big heart. 'She put the life of others before her own. Unfortunately that is how people of her kind act.' At the inquest it was revealed that the fire was caused by a neighbour on the fourth-floor who left a damp towel over a lamp. Poplar Coroner's Court heard that less than two years before the tragedy, the fire alarm systems in the block of flats, Meridian Place, had been faulty. The coroner also heard that a fire ventilation shaft that should have funnelled the smoke out of the building was too small. Delivering the conclusion Coroner Mary Hassell said Miss Rosser's death could have been avoided if a self-closing fire door was functioning as it should have been. Next week will mark two years since her death and grieving Mr Silva said he wishes to carry her legacy and live life to the full. He has moved out of the flat they shared after admitting he was unable to stay there without her . Pictured on holiday in Rome in 2011, Miss Rosser was a keen photographer and since her death Mr Silva has carried her camera taking pictures and has even taken a photography course to be as good as she was .

Oscar Silva, pictured with Sophie Rosser in happier times (left) and Miss Rosser before her death (right) At the inquest of the 23-year-old, it was revealed there was a string of failures in the fire safety at the building.

"By . Vanessa Allen . They have always been the closest of divorcees – and now the Duke and Duchess of York may have rekindled their romance. Friends say Prince Andrew and his ex-wife Sarah, both 53, have found love again, almost two decades after their marriage ended. The . Duchess, who has continued to live at Royal Lodge in Windsor with the . Duke, issued a strongly worded denial following reports they were a . couple again. Together again: Prince Andrew and Sarah Ferguson, pictured in 1995 shortly before their divorce, are said to have rekindled their romance . Wedding bells: Prince Andrew and Sarah Ferguson, pictured on their wedding day in 1986 at Westminster Abbey, have been living together at the Royal Lodge in Berkshire . Royal ride: Fergie was driven to the airport by her former husband Prince Andrew while her daughters Beatrice and Eugenie travelled in the back seat ahead of a family visit to Balmoral . Back in the fold: The once disgraced Duchess of York flew to Balmoral to spend the weekend with the Queen . But friends have described them as so close that many consider a remarriage is on the cards.One said: ‘Mark my words, they will remarry. It is only a matter of time.’ The appearance of Sarah at Balmoral earlier this month only fuelled the speculation about the strength of their relationship. Both Andrew and Sarah joined daughters Beatrice, 25, and Eugenie, 23, for a weekend at the Queen’s Scottish Highlands retreat. It . was Sarah’s first invitation back to the castle since 1992 when . newspaper photographs were published showing her ‘financial adviser’ John Bryan sucking her toes. She was staying at Balmoral at the time. Despite . her divorce and subsequent exclusion from the Royal Family’s inner . circle, the Duke and Duchess have always remained on friendly terms. Both have had other relationships but friends said neither had found lasting happiness after their divorce in 1996. Royal opinion: The Queen has long been said to have remained fond of her former daughter-in-law, but Prince Philip is said to be baffled by Fergie and Prince Andrew's relationship . While she has still visited Balmoral since her divorce, it is thought to be the first time she has been invited to stay in the main castle on the Queen's estate since her marriage ended in 1996 . The . Duchess was involved with Italian Count Gaddo della Gherardesca and . most recently Norwegian tycoon Geir Frantzen, who owns frozen food . company Findus. Andrew has been linked to several wealthy socialites, most notably Kazakh entrepreneur Goga Ashkenazi. Friends have suggested that the couple’s continuing ‘bond’ may have seen off their other relationships. In . 1999 the Duchess told an interviewer: ‘There was no reason for Andrew . and I to get divorced; there wasn’t another person in our lives to go . to. 'We got divorced . because I had to go out to work, and Andrew and I believed that it . wasn’t right for me to be commercial while I was still in the Royal . Family.’ Prince Andrew has continued to provide financial support for his ex-wife and in a 2009 interview he did not rule out remarrying. Civil: Sarah Ferguson, pictured with her two daughters Beatrice and Eugenie on holiday in St Tropez, France, separated from Prince Andrew in 1992 but they remained on good terms . Family: Prince Andrew and his former wife Sarah Ferguson pose with their daughter Beatrice following her graduation ceremony at Goldsmiths College in London in 2011 . Talking point: The Duke and Duchess of York, pictured together in London in 2000, have both previously spoken about getting married again . Joint effort: The Duchess of York, seen holding her second daughter Princess Eugenie in 1990, and Prince Andrew have raised their two daughters together . ‘Do . we have to be married?’ he said. ‘Well, let’s put it another way, I can . neither confirm nor deny the possibility. We have two great children. We still look after them.’ Some . friends said they believed the couple might remarry. One said: ‘It . wouldn’t surprise me at all. They are a wonderful couple together and, . better still, pretty amazing parents.’ Another, who saw them recently, said: ‘There has always been this bond between them and they are incredibly close. 'It . is, understandably, strange to some that they still live together so . many years after their divorce, but they really do get on brilliantly . and are hugely supportive of each other. Their biggest bond, however, is . the girls.’ Another source . said: ‘Balmoral wasn’t about them being back together, that was about . the Royal Family recognising that she had tried to turn her life around . and that they are still a family unit after all these years.’ A . spokesman for the Duchess ruled out a new relationship between the . pair. He said: ‘They continue to be joint parents and best friends and . try to set the best example for the girls.’ Close: The Queen, pictured next to Fergie at Princess Eugenie's christening at Sandringham in 1990, is said to remained fond of her daughter-in-law despite the scandals . Wedding bells: The Duke of York and Duchess of York, pictured on their wedding day in 1986, are said to be considering  getting married for a second time . On good terms: Prince Andrew and Sarah Ferguson, pictured on their wedding day on the balcony at Buckingham Palace, have remained close since their divorce . It's one of the wildest, most romantic spots on earth. Little wonder, then, that Botswana is the place that Prince Harry returns to time and time again with the lady in his life. Every one of them. He has just treated his latest girlfriend, Cressida Bonas, to a week-long safari holiday in the African wilderness. Unfortunately for her, though, it was the very same spot he frequently romanced his ex-girlfriend, Chelsy Davy, and has holidayed with his once rumoured love interest, Natalie Pinkham. The couple are understood to have spent several glorious days sailing up and down the picturesque Okavango Delta on a rickety houseboat called the Kubu Queen, sleeping out under the stars. It was the very same boat that the prince was photographed on with Miss Davy in 2008. Harry, 28, and Cressida, 24, were accompanied by Harry’s cousin, Princess Eugenie, and her boyfriend Jack Brooksbank. It is believed Eugenie first introduced the prince to her friend. The group enjoyed the odd spot of fishing and had meals cooked for them by an on-board chef. It is understood that Cressida and Eugenie flew out to Africa together from London early last week, while Harry travelled from Angola.","Duke and Duchess of York, both 53, live at Royal Lodge in Windsor together .

"By . Margot Peppers . Most of us remember My Little Pony as a candy-colored horse with a comb to brush its mane, but the modern incarnation is closer to a Barbie than a pony. With each new generation, the plastic toys seem to have longer and skinnier legs, bigger eyes and more human-like traits. In the latest version, as seen in an upcoming straight-to-DVD movie, the ponies morph fully into Equestria Girls - teenage girl versions of the animals in high school. Scroll down for video . Transformation: Applejack, one of the original My Little Ponies released in 1983 (left), gets a human, Barbie-like makeover as an Equestria Girl (right) in an upcoming DVD movie . The Equestria Girls sport the ponies' signature rainbow-colored manes, and they even have matching tails. But in their human form, they also all have tiny waists and Barbie-like proportions, with somewhat risque outfits that feature miniskirts, tight tops and knee-high boots. Some have criticized Hasbro, the . company that produces My Little Pony, for taking the toys' transformation to this extreme, morphing them into characters that . resemble Bratz. One commenter wrote on Twitter: 'My Little Pony is becoming human! Beyond creepy.' Another concerned fan of the classic . toys wrote: 'In the My Little Pony movie they turn into people - what . are you doing? I don't want my little human, I might as well watch 16 . and pregnant.' And Karen Lau, a mom from New York City, told the New York Daily News that the modern takes on My Little Pony are too hot to trot. Equestria Girls: Some have criticized Hasbro for taking the transformation of My Little Ponys to this extreme, morphing them into characters that resemble Bratz . 'They look like the Spice Girls,' she said. 'They're a little too sexy. It's an image I don't want my daughters to grow up with.' But John A Frascotti, the chief marketing . officer at Hasbro, has defended the make-over, explaining that humanizing the animals . was a necessary move from a business perspective. 'They look like Spice Girls, a little too sexy - not an image I want my daughters to grow up with' 'We . are responding to the desire by our fans to experience the brand in . more ways,' he told the New York Times. 'They imagined themselves as which pony they would . be or which pony they identified with the most.' The new movie will follow Twilight Sparkle, a princess pony, who travels to the human world through a magical mirror. At a human-inhabited high school, Twilight Sparkle runs for Fall Formal Princess - essentially a form of Prom Queen - so she can win back the magical crown that rightfully belongs to her.

The first generation of My Little Pony was the most similar to a real horse, with haunches, hooves and a mane - albeit a baby pink one. In 1989, the ponies were given more human-like smiles, as well as longer legs and hair. TV series Friendship Is Magic debuted in 2010. This saw the animals with longer legs, skinnier builds and big, anime-style eyes. Equestria Girls will be released on DVD on August 24, and will be broadcast on the Hub Network on September 1.

"By . Margot Peppers . Most girls who keep a diary don't expect anyone to read it, let alone the whole world to watch it play out on a big screen. But that's just what's happening to Maya Van Wagenen, who was 13 when she began keeping a diary about her endeavor to become popular - with the help of some seemingly archaic tips from a Fifties advice book . Now, at the age of 15, Maya's journal is being turned into a six-figure book deal by Penguin and has been recently bought by DreamWorks for a film, making her 'the youngest non-actor to ever make a feature deal at DreamWorks,' according to Deadline. Maya Van Wagenen, now 15, was 13 when she began a diary about her endeavor to become popular, with the help of a Fifties advice book. Now, her diary is being turned into a film by DreamWorks . Some of the guidance she followed and wrote about included 'every girl should wear a girdle' and 'be the girl who . . can do a million and one tricks with a strand of pearls' The movie, which is expected to be written by Sex and the City screenwriter Amy B Harris, will be based on her forthcoming two-part memoir called Popular: One Geek's Quest For The Impossible. It chronicles how in eighth grade, Maya, a self-confessed 'geek', discovered how to become popular at her new school in Brownsville, Texas, thanks to advice from Betty Cornell's Glamour Guide for Teens, a book written over 50 years ago. Some of the guidance she followed included 'every girl should wear a girdle,' 'be the girl who . . can do a million and one tricks with a strand of pearls' and 'as for making up your eyes, don't. Young eyes need no enhancement.' Betty Cornell's Glamour Guide for Teens was written in 1951 by former model Betty Cornell, who was known as 'the toast of the teens' While these may tidbits sound outdated, Deadline notes that the most important lessons she took from the book were 'timeless ones' like being open, honest and kind to everyone. 'She found that each social clique was distrustful of the others, and that all of the kids bore similar insecurities,' notes the website. Ultimately, 'she was able to find common ground and feel for the first time like she belonged.' Penguin Group bought the rights to Maya's diary in June, reportedly striking a deal in the $300,000 range. The first title in the two-book series will be published in 2014 under Dutton Children's Books. Julie Strauss-Gabel, vice president of the publisher, said in a statement: 'Her voice instantly grabbed my attention. 'Maya is not only a strong teen voice, she is a standout writer of any age.' Betty Cornell's Glamour Guide for Teens was written in 1951 by former model Betty Cornell at the age of 24, just a few years after she became known as 'the toast of the teens' for her junior modeling work. According to a release about Maya's story, one of the many surprises the teenager encountered during her experiment was getting to meet and befriend Betty herself.","Maya Van Wagenen was 13 when she began a journal about struggling to fit in with the help of advice book Betty Cornell's Glamour Guide for Teens .

Despite scarcity of research some mothers swear by eating their placenta - a practice with no anthropological precedent - saying it enhances milk supply, helps with hormonal imbalances, reduces depression and much more. Now one U.S. company has taken the trend, dubbed human placentophagia, one step further by turning the organ in to handy pills that can be popped for years after the birth. Being processed: Laura Curtis, of PlacentaWise in Lindon, Utah, prepares a placenta for a client that will be turned into capsules as a supplement for new mothers . Under the knife: Many swear by the benefits of consuming nutrient-rich placentas - although there is no anthropological evidence that it was widely done by humans before the mid-20th century . The placenta connects the developing foetus . to the uterine wall to allow nutrient uptake, waste elimination, and gas . exchange via the mother's blood supply, and is usually discarded after . birth. But PlacentaWise in Lindon, Utah, offer a service where they prepare new mothers' own placentas and turn them into health supplement capsules, just 48 hours after birth. 'It's not weird or freaky or gross, it's science' is their slogan. They say your personal placenta pills will be full of nutrients and essential hormones like estrogen, progesterone and testosterone for mammary gland development in preparation . for breastfeeding. The oxytocin supposedly decreases pain, increases mother-child bonding and counteracts the production of stress hormones such as cortisol. The organ connects the developing fetus to the uterine wall to allow nutrient uptake and waste elimination . Multiple other naturally occurring ingredients with supposed health benefits for new mothers (and those suffering PMS) include thyroid stimulating hormone, cortisone, interferon, iron, hemoglobin and human placental lactogen. Critics are yet to be fully convinced. 'It is very very rare in the UK for . people to eat their own, or other people's placentas,' said Claire . Friars, midwife for Tommy's Baby Charity said. 'A certain taboo does exist around it. Midwives may be surprised by such a request but are aware that this ritual does happen.' 'There . was some suggestion that a mother could avoid postnatal depression by . eating her placenta but no evidence has backed this up,' Ms Friars said. 'It's not weird of freaky or gross, it's science': The website for the Placenta Encapsulation Service lists a range of health claims . Benefits: Naturally occurring ingredients that can be healthy supplements for new mothers include thyroid stimulating hormone, cortisone, interferon, iron, hemoglobin and human placental lactogen . 'Some people also believe that because the placenta provides the baby with the vitamins and minerals it requires the placenta would be full of these when eaten. Again there is no evidence for this.' However, Ms Friars said: 'There have been some concerns raised around eating it raw and may carry the same food infection risks as eating raw meat. 'There have also been concerns raised around blood infections as the placenta will contain the mother's blood.' In the wild, mammals bite through the umbilical cord and eat the placenta straight after the birth. In . Chinese medicine, the placenta is known as a great life force and is . highly respected in terms of its medicinal value. It is not cooked, but . usually dried. In 1998, chef Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall cooked a placenta on his Channel 4 programme and served it at a dinner party. He . devised the recipe with mother Rosie Clear for a party to celebrate the . birth of her daughter Indi-Mo Krebbs. The placenta was fried with . shallots and garlic, flambéed, puréed and served as a pate on focaccia . bread. Channel 4 was severely reprimanded by the Broadcasting Standards Commission as a result, although the practice is legal. When placenta is eaten it is usually cooked and made into a pate or eaten like a steak or used in a similar way to other meats. It has been described as similar to liver in flavour and texture when cooked.","PlacentaWise in Utah turn new mothers' own placentas into pills .

"By . Alan Roden . Scotland's referendum battle and the Ice Bucket Challenge craze collided yesterday as Alistair Darling and Alex Salmond both agreed to be soaked for charity. The leaders of the two campaigns were nominated by Hollywood superstar James McAvoy to accept the challenge. Former Chancellor Mr Darling, chairman of the pro-Union Better Together group, was first to agree – with activists throwing buckets of ice-cold water over him in a Glasgow park this afternoon. Scroll down for video . Better Together campaign chief Alistair Darling accepted the ice bucket challenge after he was nominated by actor James McAvoy today . Mr Darling is due to face Scotland's First Minister Alex Salmond in a second debate on independence this Monday . First Minister Mr Salmond accepted the challenge minutes later. He said: 'I’m always up for any challenge, and I’m game for this one. 'It will invigorate me for the next month of campaigning – but the Scottish media should be careful what they wish for, as I get to nominate who’s next for the ice bucket!' The social media craze is aimed at raising awareness and money for the neurodegenerative disease ALS, or motor neurone disease. Before being soaked Mr Darling thanked McAvoy and tweeted a link to www.gordonsfightback.com, an awareness-raising site set up by Better Together director of research Gordon Aikman. Wearing a Scotland rugby top, Mr Darling nominated the staff of Better Together to take up the challenge next. He said: 'One of the good things about being the boss is you can nominate your staff for anything you want and tell them what to do.' Mr Aikman publicly revealed he is dying of the disease earlier this year and has raised tens of thousands of pounds to raise awareness of the condision. Among those who threw water over Mr Darling were Better Together’s top spin doctor Rob Shorthouse and former Labour MSP David Whitton. In his video, X-Men star McAvoy said: ""As it is the year of the Scottish referendum on independence, I'd like to nominate our political champions Alistair Darling and Alex Salmond to do their very worst."" As a bucket of icy water is poured over his head, he adds: ""Alex, Alistair, you've got 24 hours."" McAvoy said he was nominated for the challenge by Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho. Hollywood actor James McAvoy challenged Mr Darling - the former Labour Chancellor - and SNP First Minister Alex Salmond . Former US president George Bush, actress Gwyneth Paltrow and footballer David Beckham are among a host of well-known faces that have taken the plunge. McAvoy, who is from Drumchapel in Glasgow, has previously said he is ""anti-political"" when it comes to independence. In an interview in May he said: 'I will go with whatever way my country votes, but I don't know which way I want to go yet.'

"By . Associated Press . and Tamara Abraham . Sweden's Royal Palace says Princess Madeleine and her husband, New York banker Christopher O'Neill, are expecting their first child in March. Madeleine, the younger sister of Crown Princess Victoria, is third in line to the Swedish throne. She and Mr O'Neill got married in Stockholm on June 8. The announcement comes almost exactly 12 weeks after the fairytale ceremony, for which the 31-year-old wore a couture Valentino gown. Scroll down for video . Parents-to-be: Sweden's Princess Madeleine and her husband, Christopher O'Neill, are expecting their first child in March . Sweden's one-time 'party princess' lives with her British-American husband, 39, in New York where she works for the World Childhood Foundation, a non-profit group founded by her mother, Queen Silvia. The couple met after Princess Madeleine fled to the U.S. in 2010 with a broken heart. She . crossed the Atlantic following the breakdown of her first engagement to . Swedish attorney Jonas Bergstrom amid speculation that he had cheated . on her. Rumours of a romance with Mr O'Neill . first emerged in early 2011 when the pair were seen together at the . Central Park Boathouse. Royal family: Madeleine pictured in her engagement photo with British-born, U.S.-based banker Chris O'Neill. The couple are expecting their first child in March next year . A source told the New York Post at the time: 'She is always happy when she is with him.' Madeleine says she and her husband were friends first, and a relationship blossomed over time. 'I . appreciate Chris for his warmth and his humor,' she said. 'He has a . very big heart and he manages to make everyone in his presence feel . good. Christopher is a very thoughtful and generous person. Mr O'Neill, however, says that 'from the very outset, I immediately felt something special with Madeleine.' Insiders predicted an engagement last year when Crown Princess Victoria gave birth to a baby, Princess Estelle, and Mr O'Neill accompanied Madeleine to Estelle's baptism ceremony that May - a significant indicator, as partners of royals . are usually not invited to such occasions unless they are officially . engaged. And they were spot on. The couple announced their engagement in October 2012, confirmed in a . brief video clip posted on the royal website. 'Chris . proposed to me in New York at the start of October, and we are very . happy,' Madeleine said in the video, which was recorded Wednesday at the . Drottningholm Palace outside Stockholm. Low-key: The couple, pictured shortly before they announced their engagement, live in New York . Madeleine described the proposal as 'very romantic and intimate' but would not reveal anything beyond that. 'Madeleine . and I have known each other for two years and I recently summoned up . the courage to ask her to marry me. Thankfully she said yes,' Mr O'Neill . said in English with a British accent. He added a few words in Swedish, saying he was trying to learn the language 'but it is difficult.' Mr O'Neill revealed that he had followed procedure and asked Madeline's father, the king, for his daughter's hand in marriage. 'I felt part of the family right from the very beginning,' he said. 'Madeleine's . family is very warm and we have a very good time when we all see each . other.' In her sister's footsteps: Sweden's Crown Princess Victoria married her former fitness trainer Daniel Westling at a lavish ceremony in Stockholm in 2010. The couple had a baby, Princess Estelle, last year . Doting mother: Sweden's Princess Victoria pictured last year with baby Estelle, who is now set to get a little cousin in March . The couple's June wedding was attended by Duran Duran's John Taylor, Prince Nikolaos of Greece, Karl-Johan Persson . - the chief executive of fashion company Hennes & Mauritz . (H&M), and Roxette stars Per Gessle and Marie Fredriksson. Mr . O'Neill chose not to hold a title after the wedding as he has elected . to remain a private citizen and not be granted royal rank. The palace said today that the pregnancy would not affect Madeleine's schedule this fall. Sweden . has a constitutional monarchy in which the royals primarily serve as . figureheads. King Carl XVI Gustaf is the country's head of state, but . his powers are limited to representative and ceremonial duties. Socialite: Chris O'Neill's mother, Eva Maria, is a glamorous triple divorcee who was once linked to Prince Charles . Chris O'Neill's German mother, Eva, 73, is a former girlfriend of Prince . Charles, and . made headlines in Britain in 2003 when she invited Charles and his . then-mistress Camilla to the Amadeus festival, a high-society . celebration of Mozart's music which she organises annually in Salzburg, . Austria. When the Prince arrived at the festival, Eva greeted . him with a warm embrace and kiss - to the evident discomfort of Camilla, . who would go on to marry Charles less than two years later. Charles . and Eva apparently met at a polo match and started an affair in 1986, . when his marriage to Princess Diana was starting to break down. One . anecdote claimed that the couple were nearly caught in flagrante by . Diana herself when she walked in to the changing room at the Guard's . Polo Club in Windsor, where Charles and Eva were being intimate. The story goes that Eva had to be 'bundled through a window' to stop the Princess discovering her husband's infidelity. The . Mail on Sunday even reported that Palace insiders encouraged Charles to rekindle his relationship with Eva, in an attempt . to stop Camilla joining the Royal Family. St James's Palace . denied that the Prince had had a romantic relationship with Eva, while . she told the Mail that she invited him to Salzburg 'because I know he is . a classical music lover'. But while triple divorcee Eva may never have been a royal bride herself, her own marital history has hardly been uneventful. Her . first husband was Wolfgang Schoeller, the German honorary consul to . Indonesia, before she left him for an American cement magnate. She then married Paul O'Neill, Chris's father, a leading banker. A friend of Eva told the Mail that she even stole one of her husbands from Elizabeth Taylor. He . had apparently been dating the Hollywood icon and the two looked like . they were headed to the altar, before Eva ended up joining a cruise party he had organised with friends. The two hit it off so well that by the time the cruise was over they were engaged, and he stood Liz up at their next meeting.","Madeleine married New York banker O'Neill in Stockholm on June 8 .

"By . Nicole Mowbray . The bus is gasping and shuddering its way down the potholed street, causing my fellow passengers to tut and grumble. The irritating 'tssk, tssk, tssk' tinny drumbeat from someone's iPod is seeping through the cacophony of yells from school children exchanging insults at the back. Outside the bus, a police siren is wailing. But what do I care? I am cocooned in the land of nod, my head engulfed by a huge sound-proofed cushion that resembles a giant balaclava crossed with an old-fashioned diving helmet, with just my nose and mouth on display. Out there it may be chaos, but in here I am napping in style. Of sorts. Scroll down for video . Napping - in style? The Ostrich Pillow looks like a giant balaclava crossed with an old-fashioned diving helmet . I'm wearing an Ostrich Pillow, the brainchild of Key Portilla-Kawamura and Ali Ganjavian who set up a design studio after meeting at university in London in the 1990s. Their aim was to create simple solutions to everyday needs. And where better to start than with the Western world's chronic lack of sleep? 'Power-napping improves productivity by 34 per cent,' explains Ali. 'We spend so much time at work, in front of a screen or in transit, we thought: “Why not create something that helps us disconnect and dream?” 'All you have to do is find a place to nap, slip on the Ostrich Pillow and away you go.' Whether it's a noisy bedfellow, restless children, worrying about work or one too many late-night coffees, long-term lack of sleep now afflicts one in three Britons. In fact, last year's Great British Sleep Survey found that poor slumberers are three times as likely to have trouble concentrating and twice as likely to have relationship problems and suffer low moods as good sleepers. Pillow talk: Nicole catches up on some shut-eye while on a bus . As the type who wakes if there's a glimmer of light coming through the shutters and whose boyfriend snores like a train, there's little I wouldn't do for an extra 40 winks during the day. So, buoyed by the promise of 45 minutes shut-eye on my commute to work, I place an order for the £65 Ostrich Pillow - so-called because once it's on, you are 'buried' away from the outside world like an ostrich burying its head in the sand. All the pillows are handmade in Spain and it's obvious a lot of love has gone into the product. Mine arrives with its own carry bag emblazoned with the words 'Dream With Me: Dreams Are Today's Answers to Tomorrow's Questions'. The pillow is, in fact, more of a helmet, albeit one made from ultra-soft jersey padded out with 'smart micro balls' which are similar to beanbag filling but much more fine. This means you can slump against the side of . . . well, just about anywhere, and not feel the vibrations from the train, bus or plane. Despite its size, it's as light as helium and the micro balls are coated in a special silicone, meaning they don't make a beanbag-esque noise when you lean against them. Once squashed down, my Ostrich Pillow just about fits in my (admittedly sizeable) handbag and I trundle along to start my commute. Jumping on the bus, I leg it up to the top deck and into a much-coveted seat by the window, upon which I can rest my weary head. Bingo! I get out the pillow, cast a nervous glance around and pull it on. 'As the type who wakes if there's a . glimmer of light coming through the shutters and whose boyfriend snores . like a train, there's little I wouldn't do for an extra 40 winks during . the day.' I may not be able to see a thing, but I know I look daft - my boyfriend compared me to an alien when I tried it on at home. Thankfully, anyone who has ever lived in or visited the capital can testify that Londoners aren't fazed by anything. You could walk down the street barefoot in the snow and no one would blink an eye. After the faint sounds of a few sniggers fade away, my fellow passengers go back to playing Candy Crush Saga on their phones, leaving me free to nab the first of the day's power-naps. Who's silly now, eh? Shrouded from the outside world, I find my new headgear luxuriously soft and toasty. Despite the enclosed nature of the thing, the Ostrich Pillow isn't at all claustrophobic as it's not tight. And because it's physically wrapped around your head, it's not going to do that pesky thing that a regular pillow does when you're using it sitting up, i.e. falling away every time you adjust your position, leaving you crick-necked, angry and no less tired. Indeed, it's so comfortable and quiet inside one, there's a real danger you could drift off and miss your stop. Roused by the alarm on my phone as my 45-minute journey nears its end, I alight feeling refreshed, if a little silly. There's no way around it: this gizmo will ruin your hairdo. But on the upside, if you're tired enough to be wearing it, it's probable you didn't put too much effort into your barnet that morning anyway. After a morning in the office feeling a little more alert than normal, I donned the Ostrich Pillow again at Pret A Manger after my lunchtime bowl of soup - this time, popping my hands in the two holes either side of the helmet that allow you to keep your mitts nice and warm while you rest, face down, on a flat surface. Embarrassing: Nicole dons the pillow at a Pret A Manger, amusing the man sitting next to her . I think it embarrassed the man sitting next to me more than it did me. But, being a Londoner, he didn't say a word. After work, and a final five-minute snooze while waiting for a friend at the Tate Gallery (where my napping was interrupted by a security guard who looked most unamused, asking me to move along), I headed off to take the train home. People at Victoria Station were a little more inquisitive about my headwear. One lady asked me, in all seriousness, if I was wearing a dog's bodywarmer over my head. But even the inevitable signalling delays didn't get me down. They just meant another opportunity to grab 40 winks, this time while standing. Besides the embarrassment factor, there are other downsides to the Ostrich Pillow. It's warm, verging on the too warm. While it would be good for planes, sofas or in well-ventilated areas, wrapping a mini-beanbag around your face is not comfortable in a packed, sweaty train carriage. But, eager to respond to customer feedback, Ali and Key's firm, Studio Banana Things, recently unveiled the Ostrich Pillow Light. Constructed of the same jersey and polystyrene balls, this version wraps around your eyes and ears only in a Bruce Springsteen-style headband, leaving your neck and the top of your head exposed to the elements. You may look as if you're living in a virtual reality world while it's on your head, but the Ostrich Light can, at least, be pulled down and worn around the neck as a scarf when you're awake, and is much less bulky. Mock all you like, but a month after its launch, the company have 1,400 orders worth almost £50,000, so they're obviously onto something. After all, when you're that tired, and a pillow is this comfortable, who gives a damn what you look like? An adult size costs £65, children £50 (studiobananathings.com/ buy-ostrich-pillow).","Long term lack of sleep affects one in three Britons .

"By . Ruth Styles . For most of us, family means parents, grandparents, brothers, sisters and cousins. But for one film-maker, family, for many years, meant a sinister cult. Now Paul-Julien Robert has turned his harrowing experiences into a film, My Fathers, My Mother And Me, which tells the story of the 12 years he spent in the Friedrichshof commune near Vienna. The community he grew up in outwardly espoused free love and communal living. But these hippy ideals hid a very dark truth: in 1991, its leader, Otto Mühl was convicted of child abuse. Scroll down for video . Paul-Julien was born into a free-love commune, where possessions and chilldcare were communal and family relationships weren't allowed . To make the film, Paul-Julien was able to . mine the vast videotape library that the commune had amassed to document . life there - many of its members believed they were conducting a grand . social experiment, and wanted to record it for posterity. Paul-Julien's documentary combines present-day interviews with the children he grew up with, as well as ex-cult members - including his mother - with fascinating footage from the Seventies and Eighties. This includes clips of a group of naked adults rolling on the floor groping each other, interspersed with their blood-curdling primal screams. The film, which won the Grierson award at this year's BFI London Film Festival, doesn't make easy viewing. Robert didn't even know the name of his father until he left the cult, and describes himself as emotionally traumatised as a result. Other damaging aspects of life in the cult included the demonisation of the family and the separation of mothers and children, in order to 'break down' the concept of the 'bourgeois' familial unit. 'Everything in the outside world was described to us as evil,' revealed Robert in an interview with the Guardian. 'I knew what a nuclear family was, but it was something distant and seen as destructive.' Although he was allowed to remain with his mother, a Swiss woman named Florence Desurmont, for the first four years of his life, in 1983, when Robert was just four years old, she was sent to Zurich to earn money by the controlling and cruel cult leader, artist Otto Mühl.

Paul-Julien as a baby, with his mother and Christian, the man named as his father on his birth certificate . Paul-Julien Robert has won many awards for his documentary about his childhood, including the Grierson award at this year's BFI London Film Festival . 'My mum was the only person with whom I felt safe,' remembers Robert. 'I had a feeling that she was something more and so she meant more to me.' When she left, it was devastating. 'I was very lonely,' he told the paper. 'Other women replaced her, but they were never close to me. 'The ideology was that all relationships were bad for the group, so it was never possible to truly bond with someone.' Tragically, he still feels the impact of her loss today and admits that he has struggled to overcome the experience. 'I grew up believing love was something bad,' he explains. 'The feeling of being . loved, and of expressing love, was something I really had to learn and . to accept later.' He was able to begin to do so in 1991, when Mühl was arrested and imprisoned for sexually abusing minors and the commune shut down. He was sent to Zurich to live with his mother, eventually building a relationship with her. Now 35, he's about to become a father himself and although he admits to being occasionally nonplussed by his girlfriend's emotional approach, expects to take parenthood in his stride. But although he's no longer the emotionally traumatised boy he once was, he says the harrowing experience of growing up in a commune still haunts him. 'For me, a nuclear family is like a small commune in a way,' he explains. 'Each individual has their own opinion and to find a way to be together without losing one's self is very difficult.'

"By . George Grant For The Daily Mail . Falkirk starlet Conor McGrandles has clinched a dream move to Norwich City in a record £1million deal for the Bairns. Although they refused to disclose the precise fee, it is understood they are set to rake in a seven-figure sum with add-ons. Falkirk hailed it as the highest ever received by the club and ‘a remarkable achievement’ for their famed youth academy. Big move: Conor McGrandles has left Falkirk to join Norwich in a £1million deal . It certainly marks an incredible rise for the athletic 18-year-old midfielder who made his first-team debut nearly two years ago, just five days after his 17th birthday, and has gone to make 72 appearances. Aston Villa also showed interest but McGrandles joined the Championship side on the recommendation of former Falkirk boss Gary Holt, who returned to the Canaries in the summer as assistant to Neil Adams. McGrandles will be the third talented youngster to leave the Bairns in the space of just seven months, with midfielder Jay Fulton and defender Stephen Kingsley having departed for Swansea City in January and June respectively. Manager Peter Houston said he was ‘gutted’ to see McGrandles leave but thrilled the teenager has earned a shot at the big time. ‘Conor was always a player who was going to move on and play at a higher level,’ he said. ‘This was a fantastic opportunity for him and we wish him well at Norwich. It is also fantastic for our club – an endorsement of our commitment to our Academy and to bringing young players into the first team at a very early stage. On the up: McGrandles (left) made his debut for Falkirk shortly after his 17th birthday . ‘We said we will only sell another player this window if the offer was absolutely exceptional. This was – and it allows us to strengthen the team and have the funds to look at other developments at the club.’ Meanwhile, a Falkirk statement read: ‘The precise fee is undisclosed but is the highest ever received by the club. This is remarkable achievement for the club and its youth policy. Even before taking add-ons into consideration, the fee exceeds previous high fees from the sales of John Hughes, Scott Arfield, Murray Wallace and Stephen Kingsley. ‘The income from the transfer gives the club more financial security than ever before. The funds will not simply be used to fund operating losses. More budget has been given to Peter Houston to strengthen the first team squad and he will be working to see what new faces he can bring in. ‘It is also an exceptional achievement for Conor McGrandles. He has proved himself at our level and fully deserves his opportunity to play and earn at a much higher level. Conor has demonstrated what can be achieved through the Academy and at the club. ‘The club will never hold a young ambitious player back and fully accept this is a natural progression for such a talented player.’","Conor McGrandles has left Falkirk for Norwich in a £1m deal .

"By . Ruth Styles . Hannah Swanson was just 16 when she met the man who would change her life forever. The youngest daughter of a nurse and a policeman, she was still at school and looking forward to a bright future. Not any more. That boy turned out to be a pimp and by the time she was 18, Hannah, a bright, educated, middle class girl, had disappeared into the world of vice and violence that blights Las Vegas. One of the most visited cities in the world, with more than 35 million tourists each year, Las Vegas is also one of the wealthiest with net profits worth an estimated $15bn generated each year by the lucrative casinos. Loss: Andrea Swanson told Ross Kemp of losing her daughter Hannah, now 18, to Las Vegas' vice rings . But the bright lights of the Strip conceal a dark underbelly; a seedy world of drug addicts, gambling junkies, gangs and violent pimps. And it's in this grim, vice-ridden world that Hannah now lives - much to the distress of her mother, Andrea. Speaking to Ross Kemp on the latest episode of Ross Kemp: Extreme World, Andrea told of her loss and utter distress that there's little she can do to get Hannah back. 'In the . autumn of her junior year at High School, she met this boy,' remembers Andrea. 'All of a sudden, . she's not angry anymore and it all seems to be because of this new . boyfriend. We were delighted.' But her delight at her daughter's seemingly benign new boyfriend wasn't to last. 'All . of a sudden, he ends up in prison for stealing cars,' she says. 'That's where . the grooming happened. Devastating: Andrea says her family has been ripped apart by the actions of their daughter's pimp boyfriend . Bright lights: Las Vegas is famous for its neon lights and casinos but they conceal a dark underbelly . 'He was writing her letters, filling her head with . all these promises... Writing me letters, telling me he cared for my . daughter...' After two years in prison, Hannah's boyfriend was released and Andrea and her family cautiously welcomed him back into their lives. 'We spoke to his . parole officer,' she adds. 'I felt in control of the situation but that only lasted two to three weeks. 'Then they stopped following the rules, they started coming in a . little later and we didn't always know where she was... Three weeks later, . Hannah was gone.' Drawn into a seedy world where women are sold for a few dollars and pimps reign supreme, Hannah was just 18-years-old and had had much to look forward to. And she's not alone. According to Chris Baughman, the head of the PIT team, a branch of the Las Vegas police department's human-trafficking section, middle-class girls are becoming an increasingly common sight on the streets. 'There used to be a time back in the 80s . where guys targeted the downtrodden - girls with drug addictions or from . broken homes but we're far past that,' explains Boffman. 'We've seen girls as young as 12 . and they've come from a decent family.' Chris Boffman of Las Vegas police says the level of violence dished out by pimps to their victims is 'unreal' Arrests: Chris has arrested more than 100 pimps, many making millions from vice, during his career . Sex is big business in Las Vegas, with colourful posters advertising escort companies on every other billboard and even on targeted ad vans. 'The catch is, they aren't selling . prostitution,' says Boffman. 'It is legal to run an escort company but some of these escort . companies are run by pimps.' And the rewards for those ruthless and violent enough to prosper can be huge. 'With . three girls, they can make $1m a year,' adds Boffman. 'One of the reasons they're . so violent and protective of the women that they're trafficking is that . they have so much to gain and so much to lose if the girl should try and . come to the police or run away. 'I've seen everything from women . sexually assaulted, group raped, burned with irons, tattoos burned off . them with irons, water boarding... The violence that we see here is . unreal.' For Andrea, her only hope is that her daughter will one day manage to escape her boyfriend, who they later discovered was a pimp. 'About two to three days . before she graduated high school, I came home from work early and Hannah . was there,' remembers Andrea. Drugs: Many of the women who frequent Las Vegas' underworld are addicted to drugs like crystal meth . 'I said ""I'm worried about you Hannah"" and she flipped out. She said ""OK, OK, I f***ing trick-rolled! Is that OK now? 'You find the . drunkest motherf***er on the strip, you proposition him, you take his . ass up to the room and tell him to clean up. 'Then you steal him... you . steal him blind. You take his wallet, his watch, whatever. I did it, . Mum. Get the hell out of here!""' She told her FBI agent husband who immediately called in Chris Boffman and the vice squad. 'They came over and Detective Boffman had a three-inch binder with her . boyfriend's name on it. I was like ""what is her boyfriend's name doing . on that binder? What's going on?"" 'They basically said they had enough . evidence to build a case against her boyfriend as a pimp. I let him into . our house! I let him into my heart, into my family and he was slicking . off to fool me too.'

"By . Alasdair Glennie . Supermodels are probably inundated with flattering offers of dates from love-struck men all the time. The only trouble must be deciding which ones to accept. But Claudia Schiffer knew exactly what to do when she received a rather indecent proposal of her own – walk away with her head held high. The German-born model has told of her outrage when an Arab prince asked to ‘hire her’ for a dinner for £1million. Scroll down for video . German-born model: Claudia Schiffer as told of her outrage when an Arab prince asked to 'hire her' for a dinner . Recalling the most bizarre moments of her career, Miss Schiffer said: ‘The strangest one was an Arab prince. He asked if he could hire me for a dinner for a million pounds. I declined, and some other supermodel took it.’ Miss Schiffer added: ‘It’s not all about money. I just want to be able to walk down the street and be proud of what I do.’ Miss Schiffer’s encounter is reminiscent of 1993 film Indecent Proposal, in which a billionaire played by Robert Redford offers Demi Moore’s character $1million to spend the night with him. But she doesn’t take the moral high ground and accepts, after agreeing it with her husband, played by Woody Harrelson, who is in need of the money to set up a business. Couple: Miss Schiffer, 43, has been married to film director Matthew Vaughn (right) since 2002 . Miss Schiffer, 43, has been married to film director Matthew Vaughn since 2002, and has three children with him – son Caspar, 12, and daughters Clementine, nine, and Cosima, three. 'It’s not all about money. I just want to be able to walk down the street and be proud of what I do' Claudia Schiffer . She has become known for her glamorous appearances at the school gates after being photographed in the latest trends. But she said she makes an effort only because she feels pressure from fellow mothers. She told the Jonathan Ross show: ‘First of all I knew I had to dress up a bit, because all the other mums looked really pretty when they took their kids to school.

Once I put the make-up on I’d go, “OK, I can cope, no one can see what I’m thinking”.’ Miss Schiffer also revealed she has no concerns about getting older, saying: ‘I just think it’s a part of life.’","Arab prince asked to 'hire' German-born model for a dinner for £1million.

"A study has revealed that emotional attachment is more hurtful than extra-marital sex . Women would rather their partners had a fling than form an emotional bond with another female, according to research. A recent study found that two-thirds of women said emotional attachment is more hurtful than extra-marital sex. But for men, just a third said that their partner forming an emotional bond with another man was more painful than having a passionate affair with them. Four-fifths of women said they would be more jealous of their partner falling in love with someone else than trying different sexual positions with another woman. While over half of men said the idea of their partner in bed with someone else was a bigger upset. The American study, which polled 477 adults, was published in the journal Evolutionary Psychology. The participants were quizzed on different scenarios of emotional and sexual infidelity, and asked which would be more hurtful. Generally, women found that their partners’ emotional transgressions were more hurtful than cheating on them physically. It was the opposite for men, with most being more hurt by their partners’ sexual affairs. When both love and infidelity occurred together it was physical cheating which was overwhelmingly the biggest betrayal for males, but not females. A third of women said they would be more hurt if their partner was sexually interested in a former lover, than if they became emotionally involved with an old flame. Again, the opposite was true for men, with the majority being more hurt by any sexual interest with a former partner. Researchers questioned participants over their own lifestyle, morality, how emotionally close they were with partners, and sexual history. Men are hurt in the opposite way to women, with the majority being more hurt by any sexual interest with a former partner . Lead author Dr Gary Brase, from Kansas State University, said: ‘Males reported that sexual infidelity scenarios were relatively more distressing than emotional infidelity scenarios, and the opposite was true of females.’ Dr Brase said that men and women’s fundamental attitudes were divided. He said: ‘No factors showed a stronger relationship with reactions to infidelity than participant sex. ‘This research finds no evidence that the specific beliefs about infidelity, sex roles, attachment styles, reported socio-sexual orientation, or cognitive styles are driving the consistent sex differences found in reactions to different types of infidelity scenarios.’ He said there was a long running debate over whether it was nurture or nature that had created such opposing sexual attitudes. Dr Brase wrote in the journal that evolutionary psychologists believed the difference was down to ‘men facing a problem of paternity uncertainty’. He continued: ‘Men can never be absolutely certain that an infant carries their genes. ‘This prospect should make men differentially sensitive to sexual infidelity on the part of their mate. ‘Women, on the other hand, confront a different potential problem of ensuring continued paternal investment by the sire of their child. ‘This possibility should make women differentially sensitive to emotional infidelity of their mate.'","Women would rather partners have fling than emotional affair .

"By . Toni Jones . Being granted big, shiny accolades can be a double-edged sword in a town as demanding as Miami. The beautiful Setai in the city's South Beach area has been billed as 'the best hotel in Miami' for several years running and its restaurants are regularly hailed as some of the East Coast's finest, so our expectations were understandably high as we arrived at The Restaurant. One of two eateries at the hotel, The Restaurant has recently undergone a major menu overhaul with Executive Head Chef Mathias Gervais now overseeing an entirely Mediterranean offering after years of the place being known as a the hottest pan-Asian destination on SoBe.

Its restaurants are regularly hailed as some of the East Coast's finest, so our expectations were understandably high as we arrived at The Restaurant . It was a risk taken to appeal to the tribes of monied South Americans now holidaying in the Florida beach town. And while the seasonal European menu is a bit at odds with the Asian decor and ambience the food is fabulous enough to pull off this delicious global mash up. The Restaurant is just minutes away from the neon margarita bars of Ocean Drive, but elegant design touches like the mother-of-pearl bar and Art Deco screens imported from Shanghai lend the place a serene and grown-up atmosphere while the dark wood and red lighting throughout keeps things sexy enough for date night. Touches like the mother-of-pearl bar and Art Deco screens imported from Shanghai lend the place a serene and grown-up atmosphere . After settling in with a signature Chilli Passion cocktail (the best cocktails here still have an Asian flavour) my date and I were taken through a menu that was more South Italy than South Beach, complete with fresh black and white truffles all the way from Alba (the smell was so good we forgot to worry about the carbon footprint). I had mentioned that my better half was a vegetarian when booking and staff at the Setai were prepared with menu recommendations and a specially made amuse-bouche. The menu follows a traditional Italian format: primi, pasta, secondi and - of course - dessert, and questions about all dishes are encouraged as diners watch the chefs prepare everything around a gleaming La Plancha grill. To start, for him, a plate of local heirloom tomatoes and figs was packed with flavour and finished with a perfectly sticky balsamic glaze. For me, as the non-veggie, it was my duty to try the duck foie-gras which came with crushed Amaretti biscuits and was decadent and delicious. Being bad euros we skipped the secondi instead doubling up on truffle for our pasta dishes choosing the truffle risotto, with extra white truffle, and the fragola and pancetta pasta, with extra white truffle (this is entirely allowed when holiday dining). A punchy passion fruit soufflé with fresh coconut ice team came next (homemade ice cream and sorbet flavours change daily) and we finished the meal with another chilli-infused cocktail. Our only gripe was the music, which was too loud and too 'Eurotrash' for such an elegant setting. But this is Miami, where ear bleeding 'doof doof' to accompany a few hundred dollar dinner bill is the norm so instead of moaning we toasted the DJ with another Chilli Passion as we tried to soak up the romance of the hotel's stylish outdoor pools.

"By . Katy Winter . Men called Wayne, Liam and Ryan are mostly likely to cheat on their partners, so says a recent survey anyway. A study of 2,000 women looked at their experiences with men and saw Wayne ranked as the least trustworthy name when it comes to love.

Wayne Rooney and Ryan Giggs do . little to rescue their names' reputations. Liam Gallagher and Wayne Rooney have both previously hit headline accused of cheating on their wives . Dean, Mark and Lee appeared among the shifty top ten, while lads named Harry, Ashley and Nick also raise a red flag for women. The survey found 68 per cent of women have fallen victim to a two-timing Casanova at least once. Footballer Ryan Giggs has faced numerous allegations of cheating, including cheating on his wife with his sister-in-law . One in ten is currently dating a man accused of being a 'love rat', regardless of their seedy reputation. The research into trustworthy names was commissioned by domain name registration site Siteopia.com and found seven in ten women had been hurt by a love rat in the past. 1. Wayne . 2. Liam . 3.

Yesterday a spokesman for Siteopia.com, who conducted the study, said: 'It's telling that the top three names women try to avoid are also the names of well-known celebrity cheaters. 'According to the results these men may well have more of a wandering eye than others, but of course it's a person's actions they should be judged on not the name they go by. 'Names have great power and we will naturally recall bad experiences and make certain associations with a name if we've been affected by people with that name in the past.' Suspicious names that came lower in the top 20 included Daniel, John and Sean, followed by Darrell, Tom and James. The popular boy's name, Jack, ranked at number 20. The main reason a man becomes a love rat is if he has more than one girlfriend, claimed 63 per cent of women. Other tell-tale signs were texting behind their partner's back, being generally untrustworthy, and men spending more time with friends than their girlfriend. The Siteopia.com spokesman added: 'We should never underestimate the power of a name in influencing our opinions, even if we're not conscious of it. 'If people have a bad experience, whether with a person, a company or a service, that name will stay with us a long time and influence us going forward. 'Even in business, a name says a lot.

It seemed too good to be true, so, on behalf of Femail, I decided to put the service to the test. The perfect blow-out: Taylor's stylist Crystle arrived at her apartment promptly at 7.30am - and in just 45 minutes, had transformed her damp, straight hair (left) into a waterfall of curls (right) I had imagined that the construction of a pop-up salon . in a New York City shoebox apartment would be overwhelming, but in reality it is anything but. My stylist, Crystle, . arrived promptly at 7.30am like a Mary Poppins of hair care and within three minutes of arrival, she was looping and smoothing my hair . with a blow dryer. Between sectioning off pieces she dispensed helpful . styling tips, and explained how certain products can help or harm a . style. 'A little volumizing mousse is good!' I learned, 'but don’t tease . your roots.' After fully drying and pinning my usually poker-straight hair into curls, she doubled back with a curling iron for . extra hold. All products and tools she used were salon quality - I . winced at the sight of my own $12 metal curler in the corner. Finally, she gave my . hair a quick spritz of hairspray, shook my head back, and turned me . toward the mirror. I was completely astounded by the results. In just 45 minutes she had transformed my damp, straight hair into a waterfall of . curls - barely the time it takes me to get ready. Easy: The effortless booking process is largely thanks to the app, which features a menu of ten hairstyles including an up-do, two braided looks, and several other options aimed at accommodating different hair types . By the time I took my . eyes off the mirror, she had packed back up her things and gave me a . warm hug goodbye.

We don't . leave you with any clean-up.' 'Some women are nervous to let a stylist into their home because they don't want a mess, so we try to make it as easy as possible' Given this hyper-efficiency, the service is already proving popular among new moms.

"By . Richard Arrowsmith for MailOnline . With Mauricio Pochettino still struggling to decide who will be leading Tottenham's line this season, Harry Kane staked his claim with another impressive performance in the Europa League. The 21-year-old scored a superb effort in the first-leg against AEL Limassol to help Spurs take a 2-1 advantage into the return game at White Hart Lane on Thursday evening. With Emmanuel Adebayor rested on the substitute's bench ahead of Sunday's visit from Liverpool and Roberto Soldado withdrawn from the squad with injury, Kane seized the opportunity to impress. On target: Harry Kane impressed in Tottenham's 3-0 defeat of AEL Limassol in the Europa League . Competition: Roberto Soldado (L) and Emmanuel Adebayor (R) stand in the way of Harry Kane's starting place . During an energetic 90 minutes, Kane had six attempts on goal and scored a superb opener - while his Opta Index touch map shows his involvement across the pitch and 11 touches in the opposition penalty area. The youngster could, and probably should have, opened the scoring after only six minutes when a rash challenge  on Kyle Naughton led to the Limassol keeper Karim Fergouche being replaced and a penalty awarded to the hosts. Despite the lengthy delay, Kane was brave enough to step forward - although his straight down the middle penalty was easily saved. Nonethless, to his credit Kane did not allow the miss to affect his game as he continued to use his large frame to give the Cypriot defence a torrid time during an industrious first-half display. Brave: The Tottenham youngster stepped up to take an early penalty but missed from the spot . Perseverance: Harry Kane was rewarded with a beautifully composed opening goal . Remember the name: Harry Kane celebrates after staking a place to become Tottenham's leading striker . Involved: Harry Kane touch map vs AEL Limassol . Kane was not afraid to continue asking for the ball despite missing a few more first-half opportunities - including skying a superb chance after being set up with a back heel from Aaron Lennon in the Cypriot's penalty area. But, the graduate of Tottenham's youth system, was eventually rewarded for his perseverance just before the stroke of half-time. Kane raced on to a slide rule pass from Brazilian midfielder Paulinho to cooly slot home Spurs' opening goal with a low finish that would have impressed his manager with his composure. Paulinho practically secured Tottenham's passage into the next stage of the competition when he drilled home a second within minutes of the re-start. Tottenham noticeably eased back after taking a 4-1 aggregate lead, with Kane's role reduced to holding up the ball and involving others. He did have another chance midway through the second-half, showing similar composure as he tried to surprise the keeper with a low effort at the near post that required a smart save. Spurs were awarded a second penalty on 64 minutes, although another player hoping to earn recognition, Andros Townsend, argued for the responsibility before  effortlessly netting in the bottom right corner. Boy from Brazil: Paulinho doubled Tottenham's lead with a strike at the beginning of the second half . Spot on: England international Andros Townsend scored Tottenham's third with a penalty .

Kane could have easily had a hat-trick with a series of missed chances in the second-half, including another effort blocked by the feet of the keeper after being sent through by Aaron Lennon and some neat footwork in the box before being dispossesed. But he never stopped showing willingness, determination and desire. Kane was deservedly given man-of-the-match for a performance that accompanied a goal with superb ball retention, constant involvement and an enduring attitude. After the game, Pochettino said: 'I have always believed in Harry since the first day. 'That is football. I think it is possible to miss penalties, but it is not important. 'He found a way to score, to play and did not let it affect his performance. It was good. 'He showed character and personality. He has a very strong mind and Harry is a very good player, too.' With Soldado's future at the club remaining uncertain before the close of the January transfer widow and Adebayor's reputation for inconsistency, Kane's stock at White Hart Lane is rising with every goal scored.

"By . Emily Davies . Brides-to-be planning their weddings are usually most worried about one purchase in particular: the dress. But while fretting over styles, cost and comfort, many don’t pause to think about what sort of gown their groom would choose. A survey of British men showed their idea of the perfect wedding dress differed greatly from what women would choose. Spot the difference: Men were asked to choose their ideal wedding dress for their wives and they'd opt for a meringue style while women go simple and pared-back . Brides magazine worked with designer Ian Stuart to create a man’s ideal gown for his bride, which turned out to be ivory, rather than white – the colour preferred by women. Nearly half of men preferred an off-the-shoulder neckline, whereas women described their perfect dress as having capped sleeves. Women wanted to walk down the aisle in dresses made of plain Chantilly lace whereas men liked the idea of their brides wearing satin on their wedding day. The perfect wedding dress, as envisioned by a man: Brides magazine worked with designer Ian Stuart to create a man's ideal gown for his bride, which turned out to be ivory with an an off-the-shoulder neckline and corset waist . The dress-shape favoured by 43 per cent of men was the princess design featuring a corset body with a full skirt. Women, on the other hand, preferred a fish-tail design which is more tightly fitted down to the thighs with a more modest-sized skirt. What women want: This is the dress that women want to walk down the aisle in. It's made of plain Chantilly lace, is white and features a fish-tail design . Diamante and crystals were deemed the best kind of dress detail and fresh flowers in the bride’s hair completed the perfect bridal look according to men. Women thought a tiara or headdress were the best accessories for tying the knot. But the sexes did agreed on the perfect length of a gown; with the majority of both men and women opting for full-length dresses for the big day. Mr Stuart’s vision of the perfect dress, as imagined by men, is a dropped waist princess silhouette shape with pleated skirt and a chapel train. The dress is made of taupe silk satin and has a fifties style draped off-the-shoulder portrait collar and a Swarovski Crystal encrusted belt. Last year the dream dress as imagined by women was made a reality by Stephanie Allin, who has a bridal gown workshop in Wales. Last year’s dress was a full-length fishtail-shape gown, with a full train and cathedral-length veil.

'The ingredients of the dress are text . book fairytale, classic and beautiful. The men have come up with a . timeless design that is the epitome of bridal fashion' Brides magazine Editor, Jade Beer said: ‘With Brides readers having voted for the Nation’s Favourite Wedding Dress last year, we felt it was only right to ask for a man’s view this time. As the results came in, we were all predicting a body skimming fishtail silhouette that would show off curves like nothing else. 'How wrong we were! The shape he actually favoured over any other was a full length, off the shoulder princess gown in satin and heavily embellished with crystals. 'There is no doubt that men have good taste and have created a truly beautiful wedding dress – and we are thrilled and honoured that renowned British bridal designer Ian Stuart has brought this vision to life for us.’ The designer: Ian Stuart, who helped design the dresses, has created gowns for members of the royal family . Mr Stuart added: 'The ingredients of the dress are text book fairytale, classic and beautiful. The men have come up with a timeless design that is the epitome of bridal fashion. 'The cleverness of this dress is that it will suit all sizes and heights, which is not an easy thing to achieve in one design. It’s a clear sign that the grooms imagine their brides to wear a wedding dress, with a more traditional full skirt and romantic mood.’ Ian Stuart’s dress will be on display at Brides The Show, where one bride will win the dress, tailor-made by Mr Stuart.

"By . Ruth Styles . and Sophie Jane Evans . From a delicate dress crafted from roses to a flock of floral peacocks and a World War One trench, the designers of this year's spectacular Chelsea Flower Show gardens took inspiration from a wide range of sources. The trench, which was among hundreds of exhibitions to feature at the show, took home one of the top awards after proving popular with the Royal Horticultural Society judges. Featuring sandbags, tiny metal rats, colourful planting and a giant poppy fountain, it attracted the eyes of thousands of visitors as they toured the gardens. And it even got the royal seal of approval when the Queen visited yesterday. As the monarch toured the garden, she stopped to note that it was a .

"By . Naomi Greenaway . When you think of feminist literature, Germaine Greer's works or Sheryl Sandberg’s recent hit Lean In might spring to mind. You may be less likely to consider a publication that’s pink all over with puppy dogs on the cover and hearts and flowers on every page. But that’s exactly the format of the latest feminist offering, hoping to make a positive stamp on the malleable minds of our nation’s young girls. New direction: Girl Talk has reevaluated its content after 'unsettling' survey results . Role model: Katy Perry was voted the most admired celebrity by Girl Talk readers . Girl Talk . magazine, which is aimed at 7-10-year-olds, has re-launched with a new . feminist ethos in response to a new poll carried out by the . magazine to mark their 500th issue. The . results, which tapped into the mind-set of the magazine’s 376,000 . readers, are described by the magazine's editor Bea Appleby as . ‘unsettling, if not surprising’. With the exception of children’s writer Jacqueline Wilson, the top 10 most admired celebrities were all singers or actors. The latest issue of Girl Talk Magazine, which launches their #GirlsAreAmazing campaign, which carries with it an underlying editorial proimise . Sportswomen, politicians and businesswomen barely registered on the list. Popstrel . Katy Perry was voted ‘most admired celebrity’ by readers, followed by . fellow chart regulars Taylor Swift in second place, and Jessie J in . third position. The . survey also revealed an overwhelming 80 per cent of young girls . wanted to be referred to as ‘pretty’, ‘kind’ and ‘funny’, with only 20 . per cent choosing ‘clever’, ‘strong’ or ‘brave’ as important attributes. More . than a third of girls aspired to jobs in showbiz and their top 10 . career choices were either artistic, performing or caring – all in roles . traditionally thought of as feminine. The poll prompted the magazine to reevaluate its content and launch #GirlsAreAmazing campaign, which aims to broaden ambition in young girls. ‘So much is said about the media having a bad effect on girls, so we had to really look at ourselves and make sure our influence is positive,’ Bea told MailOnline. ‘I would like readers to feel inspired . and confident that they really can achieve anything that they like -- . and that they are perfectly normal if they don't feel dainty, girly and . sweet.’ As a result, all scantily clad pop-stars are banned from their pages. Instead you’ll find a broader range of role models. ‘In . every issue we have career profiles of women with less typically female . jobs. So far we have had a woman pilot, a nuclear safety scientist, . comic book artist, racing car diver and in the next issue a female . coder,' Bea says. Positive change: Jessica Ennis-Hill, pictured after winning gold at London 2012, will be featured more in Girl Talk . Girls Rock!: Readers (left) and Girl Talk editor Bea Appleby (right) model #GirlsAreAmazing T-shirts in support of the campaign to empower young girls and broaden their ambitions . ‘Our . posters have changed too - instead of just One Direction and Taylor . Swift, we now have sportswomen and powerful characters from films and . TV. ‘Every . issue we have a full page profile of our hero of the fortnight - people like children’s writer Jacqueline Wilson and sportswomen Serena . Williams and Jessica Ennis-Hill. ‘We also have stories about girls who have done amazing things, like Malala Yousafzai, and opinion pieces from readers.' Equally important to the type of content the magazine is planning on upping is the type of content they promise to exclude. Inspiring: The magazine will feature more stories 'about girls who have done amazing things' such as Malala Yousafzai - pictured being applauded by members of the UN . New leaf: Girl Talk's pages will now include more images of 'positive role models' such as Serena Williams . The mantra, which appears on the first page of every issue, reads: . ‘We don't talk about boyfriends, sex, puberty or anything inappropriate for our age group. ‘Our core readers are 9-10 years old, so we have to be really careful that our editorial is just right for them,’ says Bea. ‘You . won't find anyone who is unsuitable for our age group in Girl Talk, so . that's Miley Cyrus, Rihanna and Robin Thicke don't feature at all. ‘And they aren't really aiming their products at our readers either. Pretty much anyone who persistently rolls around in their underwear or . sings songs with rude lyrics won't feature in the magazine.' Girl Talk’s aim is to instil a well-balanced, healthy outlook amongst readers. ‘We . want to encourage girls to achieve and break away from limiting and . old-fashioned beliefs about what they can do,’ explains Bea. ‘We want to make different kinds of women visible to them; women whose success is not based on looks. City girl chic: Taylor Swift, who came second in the Girl Talk poll, steps out in New York . 'The survey was inspired by a feeling that there was something very wrong with media for girls,’ she explains. ‘There are lots of news stories and . statistics about the lack of good female role models, the pressure to . look pretty, sexualised pop stars, low self-esteem, girls' narrowing . ambitions and the fear of them growing up too quickly. ‘We wanted to see if this was true of . our readers and to find out more about their lives. So we asked about . the women they admire, what worries them, careers they aspire to and . whether they believed they could reach those goals,' she says. Girl Talk have vowed to ban pop stars in favour of stronger role-models for their pre-teen readers . Bea said she feels confident the magazine can have a positive impact. ‘When I was a child I read magazines voraciously and they had a huge influence on me; what I wore, what I wanted to be when I grew up and what kind of girl I was,' she says. One Girl Talk fan, Glamour editor Jo Elvin, even wrote to Bea to say her daughter has started a blog because Girl Talk suggested it.","Girl Talk polled readers aged 7-10 to asses aspirations .

"By . Ruth Styles . Angel ancestors, embassies for extraterrestrials and advanced supercomputers recording all human memory and DNA: Welcome to the often strange world of the Raëlians. Now the sect, which was founded in 1974 by Claude Vorilhon, a French retired racing journalist, has thrown open its doors to the cameras for the first time, after presenter Darren McMullen travelled to Croatia to meet the Raëlians living there. But, as Glenn Carter, the man responsible for the UK's Raëlian population reveals, there's more to Raëlian life than alien ancestors. Man in charge: Claude Vorilhon, a.k.a Raël, is the French former journalist who created the religion . 'Being Raëlian means that I believe in the fact that all life on earth was created by the Elohim; a society who came to earth 25,000 years ago specifically to create life,' explains Mr Carter of his beliefs. 'We also believe that Raël [Vorilhon's Raëlian name] is their messenger, here to tell the world of these facts and to open the people of the world’s minds to the idea that we are in fact an intentional scientific creation. 'The main goal of Raëlians at this stage is to create an embassy in order to facilitate and welcome the return of the Elohim to Earth.' Like Scientology, Raëlianism is considered a 'UFO religion' with similar theories on intelligent design and extraterrestrial life as the American sect. Fascinated: Presenter Darren McMullin joins Raëlians at a conference in Hrvatska in Croatia . Sermon: Raëlian 'bishop' Brigitte Boisselier is the president of Clonaid, which promotes human cloning . Unlike the Scientologists, however, Raëlians are famous for espousing sexual freedom and scientific development, and even claimed to have produced the world's first cloned human baby in 2002. The cult hit the news again in 2012, when they staged a 'Go Topless' protest in Toronto in a bid to persuade city authorities to allow women to go braless in public. Other controversies have included their use of the swastika as a symbol of peace which, until 1991 when it was replaced by another motif, meant that the Raëlians found themselves banned from opening 'extraterrestrial embassies' in Israel and Lebanon. Yet despite their frequently bizarre behaviour, Carter, who discovered the religion while browsing through some of its publications in a London bookshop, is at pains to point out that Raëlianism is a real religion - and one that deserves to be taken seriously. 'Even in our most controversial . moments, the Raëlian movement is attempting to help people and society at . large, whether they believe in the Elohim or agree with us or not,' explains Carter. Protest: Raëlians have staged protests in favour of cloning and free love all over the world, including Tel Aviv . 'Our cloning campaign pushed legislators . in the UK to legalise and licence stem cell . therapies three to five years earlier than they were planning to do so. 'We in the . UK are now a leading light in the world in this amazing medical . technology. Yet we the movement and me personally took lots of negative . criticism for this.' He's also got strong words for those who write off Raëlianism as just another cult. 'I personally feel that the use of . terminology like ""cult"" in the wrong context makes the user be seen . clearly as either unaware of the bigotry they echo or the bigot and a . fool they are,' he insists. 'Both speaks volumes of them and yet says nothing of the . movement or myself.' On a day-to-day basis, Carter says his world is one that would be recognisable to most of us, with the main rite, baptism, only allowed on the four Raëlian anniversaries. One comes on the 6th August and commemorates the Hiroshima bomb, while the others include the 13th December, the day on which Vorilhon had his first alien encounter, and the first Sunday in April, which, say the Raelians, was the day Adam and Eve were created by extraterrestrials. Alien encounter: Vorilhon, pictured with a mock spaceship, says his first meeting with aliens took place in 1973 . Explanation: Croatian Raëlians David and Princess Luna explain their beliefs to Darren McMullen during supper . The final date is the 7th of October, the date on which, in 1975, Vorilhon claims he was taken for a ride in a spacecraft by the Elohim. Other key beliefs include world peace and a coming judgement day when the Elohim, who record every human memory and DNA on an advanced supercomputer, will return to Earth and resurrect those who have already died using cloning. In preparation for that day, the Raëlians are in the process of creating an extraterrestrial embassy, which they hope to build in Jerusalem, to welcome the Elohim back to Earth. Among those looking forward to the big day is Carter. 'I will welcome Elohim with respect, . just as one would welcome your long-departed parents back home,' he enthuses. 'Why . would I do this?,' he adds. 'Because they created a wonderful place for me to . inhabit and are the reason I and all of us exist.' The Raëlians appear on Outsiders With Darren McMullen, tonight at 10pm on National Geographic Channel .","Raëlians believe humans are descended from aliens whom they call Elohim .

"An unfeasibly slender mother-of-four has set a new Guiness World Record by eating 12lbs of pudding in just three minutes. Nebraska-based Molly Schuyler, 34, a competitive eater with several food guzzling accolades to her name already, smashed the previous world record, which was a paltry 2lbs 15oz of pudding in the same time. The stomach-churning feat was performed on Dish Nation and uploaded to YouTube, and sees the slim brunette consume a whopping 15,120 calories in one sitting - that's the equivalent of over seven days' worth of recommended calorie intake for a woman. Scroll down for video . Pudding guzzler: Molly Schuyler, a 34-year-old mother-of-four, consumed exactly 12lbs of pudding in a record-smashing three minutes, earning herself a Guiness World Record . In the three minute stunt, which tows the fine like between revolting and riveting, Ms Schuyler crouches eagerly over the enormous glass bowl of creamy pudding and shovels it down her throat with hawk-like concentration and lightning-fast spoon-to-mouth motion. The five hosts behind her observe slack-jawed with disbelief, one repeatedly questioning: 'Is she even breathing?' 'I don’t think she’s swallowing, I think it’s just, like, this natural gravitational pull', observes another. Determination: The bony speed-eating champion barely came up for air once during the bizarre feat, leading one stunned host to question whether she was even breathing . She certainly earned that! Ms Schuyler beat the previous world record an astonishing six times over, devouring more than a week's worth of recommended calorie intake in just one sitting . At one point, Ms Schuyler pauses to let out an almighty belch, before dutifully returning to the task at hand, her cheeks smeared with the custard colored goop. 'I'm so scared for what's going to happen after!' squeals one queasy looking judge, sheepishly clutching a black garbage bin in preparation for a possible resurgence. But no, Ms Schuyler completes the task and gracefully accepts her certificate as she is welcomed into the Guiness World Record 'family'. Where did it all go? With a petite frame, at 5ft 7in and 125 pounds, her eating abilities are truly incredible . Make mine a large! Ms Schuyler has been competitive eating for less than a year and says she eats to support her four kids . Not only has the ravenous mother defied previous records, she's overcome the normal abilities of the human stomach, which can usually only stretch to hold a capacity of 8lbs. And it's far from the first time she has demonstrated her eating prowess for the world to see. She is currently ranked the number one Female Independent Competitive Eater in the world. Other records include demolishing a 12lb sandwich washed down with 1lb of French fries in just under an hour - the only woman to even finish this particular challenge. Slender: Mrs Schuyler's slim physique, and the fact that she has birthed four kids, may come as a surprise to those who've watched her eat . New-found skill: The full-time server only started eating competitively last August . She also devoured a 72oz steak, the size of a newborn baby, in under three minutes in January of this year, and competed in over 20 different food eating contests nationwide in 2013. Ms Schuyler, who serves food for a living, has spoken previously of her unusual talent, saying: ‘It's an unexplained phenomenon. I was just born that way. I started doing this about a year ago, and I guess it's like a stupid human trick.' Her husband, Sean, also says she is 'amazing when it comes to eating.'","Molly Schuyler, 34, consumed six times the quantity of pudding devoured by the previous Guiness World Record holder .

"By . Katy Winter . Those for whom standard clubbing has become so passé, or for anyone looking to combine their artistic talents with alcohol and a touch of voyeurism, there is a new trend about to hit the UK. Coming from the US, Nude Body Painting involves a club night where you turn up, strip down, and proceed to both dance, drink and paint each other’s naked bodies with UV paint. While the more body conscious, or simply those who shudder at the thought of twerking naked, will be relieved to hear that getting down to the buff is not mandatory, Nude Body Painting is definitely not a night for wall flowers. The concept of the Naked Painting Parties is simple- strip off as much as you like and grab a paint brush . Nude Body Painting, the first of which is to be held later this month, is definitely not a night for wall flowers . The energy at the painting parties is best described as The Full Moon Parties in Thailand meets Art Basel . The first UK party, which is to be held in London on May 25th, is set to feature feature electric, bizarre colours and décor, deep house and circus performers as well as the 300 naked revellers. A concept devised by Social Exposure, a New York City-based avant-garde events company, the events have been a massive success state-side and across the world, drawing hundreds of eager thrill seekers in New York, Mexico and Miami. As well as a chance to bare it all and network outside the box the idea of the nights is to 'celebrate inner beauty, positive body image and unity through the arts', with the energy at the painting parties can be best described as The Full Moon Parties in Thailand meets Art Basel. ‘When I first heard about this concept coming to London, I just HAD to make it happen at Trapeze Bar!""

As well as a chance to bare it all and network outside the box the idea of the nights is to celebrate inner beauty, positive body image . ‘Shoreditch is quickly becoming the best area for new, exciting and refreshing nightlife and The Naked Painting Party is certainly all encompassing. ‘It is one of the ONLY events in the world that is so hugely interactive and collaborative. People don’t sit around and watch someone paint, the point is to paint each other. ‘Brushes are going every where and you should expect to leave completely covered in paint,' explains founder of Social Exposure, Sally Golan. The rules for the eccentric evening are things such as ‘No inappropriate behaviour’ and ‘respect each others privacy and bodies’. The premiere of the Nude Body Painting marks a growing trend in strange and Avant guard parties and themed club nights in the UK as people grow increasingly bored with the traditional drink-and-dance formula. Pheromone parties – where guests smell each other’s well-worn clothing to judge their compatibility based on attraction to someone’s natural musk- are increasing common around the UK, as are mainstream sex-clubs like Candy Kittens, where guests can go clubbing in an upmarket venue while engaging with as much, or as little sexual activity as they like.","Nude Body Painting parties set to hit the UK later this month .

"By . Lucy Waterlow . Earlier this week Princess Beatrice visited the RHS Chelsea Flower Show with the Queen. And it seems the floral exhibits gave her style inspiration as she attended the first garden party of the season at Buckingham Palace today. The Queen's granddaughter wore a colourful flower print skirt with a long sleeve cream blouse with an embellished collar and gold buttons. She continued the floral theme with her headwear, wearing a fascinator topped with a cream rose designed by Welsh milliner Robyn Coles. Flower power: Princess Beatrice joined her grandmother's garden party at Buckingham Palace today . Top to toe: The princess kept up the floral theme with a rose-topped fascinator by Welsh milliner Robyn Coles . The outfit was a safe bet for the 25-year-old who isn't always praised for her fashion choices. Most famously, she was mocked around the world for the unusual Philip Treacy-designed fascinator she wore to her cousin Prince William's wedding to Kate Middleton. When it came to her footwear today, she seems to have taken her cue from another Middleton - Pippa - who recently advised against wearing heels to an event on grass. The sister of the Duchess of Cambridge offered her pearls of wisdom in the June edition of Vanity Fair, referring to the best way to dress for a day at Ascot. Sensible choice: Beatrice took Pippa Middleton's advice wearing wedges to the event on grass . Doing granny proud: Beatrice chatted to many of the guests at the garden party . She wrote: 'It is a busy day trying to fit in horse racing, betting, picnics, and afternoon tea - oh, and avoiding sinking your heels into the grass. I recommend wedged shoes - there's often a lot of walking.' Her sister, Kate, is another firm fan of wedges and is frequently pictured in a pair. The sensible foorwear was definitely needed for Princess Beatrice as she spent time on her feet mingling with some of the hundreds of guests invited to the palace event. Ready to party: The Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh were dressed up for the occasion . Welcome: The Queen greets some of her many guests . Show must go on: The Duke was happy to shake hands despite recently having a minor procedure on this right hand that required bandaging . Inspiration: Earlier this week, Beatrice visited the Chelsea Flower Show . The Queen was also in attendance wearing a matching lavender coat and dress designed by Angela Kelly. She was joined by the Duke of Edinburgh who was in good form despite recently needing medical attention. It was revealed today that the Duke has had a 'minor procedure' carried out on his right hand that required him to wear a bandage - but didn't stop him carrying on with royal business as usual.","First royal garden party of the season .

"By . Luke Salked . Her aristocratic father-in-law chose to snub the marriage that officially made her part of his privileged - and eccentric - family. But the new Viscountess Weymouth is making sure Lord Bath gets a good look at what he missed – by exhibiting the wedding snaps on the walls of his stately home. Emma McQuiston, 27, has decorated Longleat House with her designer wedding dress and a large portrait of herself after she married Lord Bath’s son, Ceawlin Thynn. Scroll down for video . Act of defiance: Emma McQuiston, 27, has decorated Longleat House with her designer wedding dress (centre) and a large portrait of herself (far right) after she married Lord Bath's son, Ceawlin Thynn, in June last year . Wedding day: Ceawlin Thynn's parents had refused to attend the wedding after father and son fell out over the removal of murals from the walls of the historic country pile in Wiltshire. Above, the Weymouths . His parents had refused to attend the event, and went to another wedding instead, after father and son fell out over the removal of murals from the walls of the historic country pile in Wiltshire. Lady Emma, who has appeared in photo shoots for glossy magazines, later said of Lord Bath’s absence: ‘It’s very sad he didn’t come to the wedding and that the misunderstanding has escalated to this point, but what can I do?’ And in what many may see as an . appropriate – if slightly cheeky – response, the new glamorous . viscountess has installed an exhibition of her own. It is part of a show organised Lady Emma - who will become Britain’s first black marchioness - called ‘Something Old and Something New’, examining the history of family weddings at the 9,500-acre estate, which is famous for its safari park. Portrait: Lady Emma poses alongside her bridal portrait, which was painted by renowned artist Paul Benney . Sprawling estate: The showcase at Longleat House (pictured) in Wiltshire includes portraits of Lady Emma's big day, as well as diaries, photos, portraits and even newsreel footage of previous Thynn family weddings . Her Collarusso-made wedding dress has been put on display, along with a new portrait of the blushing bride painted by renowned artist Paul Benney. The showcase includes portraits of her big day as well as diaries, photos, portraits and even newsreel footage of previous Thynn family weddings . She explained: ‘The new exhibition is a lovely reminder of the wedding and it is a great way to showcase all the amazing work and effort others put in to make it such a memorable and joyous occasion. ‘It’s also fascinating to be able to compare it to other weddings which have taken place here at Longleat over the centuries.’ Argument: Ceawlin Thynn (right) was not on speaking terms with his parents after he removed murals his father Alexander Thynn (left), the seventh Marquess of Bath, had painted on the walls of the stately home . Younger days: Ceawlin Thynn in front of Longlet House in 1993. He has known his wife since she was four . Lady Emma gained her title in June last year, when as plain Emma, the daughter of a Nigerian oil tycoon, and an aspiring TV chef and food-blogger, she married Ceawlin Thynn, 40, whom she has known since she was four years old. But the groom was not on speaking terms with his parents after he removed murals his father Alexander Thynn, the seventh Marquess of Bath, had painted on the walls of the stately home, when he moved into the property. Lord Bath, 82, failed to attend the wedding and instead attended the marriage of a family friend in Hampshire. Viscountess: Lady Emma (pictured last year) gained her title in June 2013, when as plain Emma, the daughter of a Nigerian oil tycoon, and an aspiring TV chef and food-blogger, she married 40-year-old Ceawlin Thynn . He is the seventh Marquess of Bath and is known for his Bohemian lifestyle and sex life which has famously involved a so-called ‘harem’ of scores of ‘wifelets’. Lady Emma has previously spoken of racism in the British aristocratic circles in which he now mingles, telling Tatler magazine: ‘There has been some snobbishness, particularly among the much older generation. ‘There’s class and then there’s the racial thing.’","Emma McQuiston, 27, has recently decorated Longleat House in Wiltshire .

"By . Misty White Sidell . Only two out of 20 of the U.S.’s leading sunscreens actually provide the SPF protection that is described on their bottles, according to a new study. Consumer Reports tested 20 of the leading sunscreens in a lab to find that very few of these protectants actually hold up to their initial worth after only a brief exposure to sun, sweat, and water. The only two that did succeed were BullFrog's Water Armor Sport InstaCool SPF 50+ spray and Coppertone Water Babies SPF 50. Big winners: Consumer Reports has recommended Coppertone's Water Babies Formula and Bullfrog's Water Armor Sport as the top two performing products . Top products: Consumer Reports has recommended seven sunscreens based on their level of effectiveness in combatting UVA and UVB rays, including Banana Boat's Ultra Defense Spray, Target's Up& Up Sport Spray, and Walgreen's Continuous Spray . Holding up: These recommended products were vigorously tested by the magazine on human subjects, leading Consumer Reports to also recommend Neutrogena's Ultimate Sport and Equate's Broad-Spectrum formula . Consumer Reports’ most effective sunscreen products: . Five other recommended sunscreens: . Big . winners - aside from the best performing two - included Banana Boat’s Ultra . Defense Max Skin Protect SPF 110 spray, as well as Target’s Up & Up . Spray Sport SPF 50. Those . that did not stack up, and did not earn a recommendation include Banana . Boat Kids SPF 50 as well as Coppertone Sport High Performance SPF 30 . spray. In . fact, many sunblocks' efficiency came in at four to 40per cent below their claims. Beyond . Coastal's Natural SPF 30 came in at less than half of its purported . effectiveness. The magazine warns that while the FDA . regulates SPF, broad spectrum, and water resistance claims, they only do . so by reading brand studies of required health standards - and do not . verify these results or conduct tests of their own. But according to the study, this does not mean that the offending sunscreens do not offer any protection at all. Even at half its effectiveness rate, Beyond Coastal's sunscreen is still offering an SPF 15's worth of protection - which according to the magazine, does not offer all that much difference in terms of protection from a SPF 50 product. Falling short: Of the 20 sunscreens that it tested, Consumer Reports has advised shoppers against 13 - which included California Baby's Super Sensitive Broad Spectrum, Coppertone Sport Accuspray, and CVS Sheer Mist Spray . While an SPF 15 can block 93per cent of . rays at its optimal efficiency, a SPF 50 is only a grain ahead with . 98per cent of ray protection. Rather than scare consumers about the dangers of purchasing an SPF, researchers hopes to educate them to investigate products prior to purchase. They achieved their lab results by applying products in patches to test subjects’ skin. All of the products evaluated had a minimum SPF level of 30. The . panellists were then instructed to soak in a tub, after which they were . exposed to UVB radiation – the kind that causes sunburns and skin . cancer - from a sun simulator. One . day later the patches were examined for redness – the results of which . led Consumer Reports to rate their corresponding sunscreens on their . levels of effectiveness. A . separate group of test subjects followed the same procedure, but were . exposed to UVA rays instead – the kind that creates a tan and ages skin. Their test patches were evaluated for levels of tan, rather than . redness. Tests inspired by the FDA's critical wavelength studies were also conducted, by covering plastic plates in SPF to see how UV rays are absorbed by the heated plates. Washing away: These sunscreens, including Walgreen's Baby Formula and Banana Boat Kids, lost an average of 4 to 40per cent effectiveness when exposed to water, with Beyond Coastal's SPF losing half its efficiency . Safety measures: While a dissipated efficiency does not mean consumers are not receiving any protection at all, the magazine recommends that sunscreen is reapplied every two hours when sweating and swimming to ensure the best result, but would not recommend Coppertone's Sensitive Skin, No-Ad Sport, or Up & Up's Kids formula . For optimal use, the magazine says . that consumers should apply sunblock 15 to 30 minutes prior to sun . exposure, and should reapply it every two hours after swimming or . sweating. In . tabulating their results, the magazine was able to recommend seven . sunscreen products to consumers, also including their cost as a deciding . factor in what protectants are a worthy buy.","Coppertone's Water Babies formula and Bullfrog's Water Armor Sport product are the two top performing sunblocks .
Other sunscreens, like Beyond Coastal's SPF 30, hold as little as half their SPF claims ."
"By . Ruth Styles . 'I have a lot of shoes.' 15-year-old Lauren Walsh, from Morecambe in Lancashire, is giving a guided tour of her extensive shoe collection. 'I was begging my mum for these,' she continues, showing off a pair of Hunter wellies, 'and said I'd wear them all the time. 'They were really expensive but I haven't even worn them once. Most of them I don't even wear!' And it's not just shoes. Lauren, who spends more than £600 a month, also had a wardrobe crammed with designer treats, most of which lie unworn. Spolit: 15-year-old Lauren Walsh has an extensive shoe collection but says she hardly ever wears any of them . Paying for it all is her mother Jackie, a carer on £6.81 an hour, who has been forced to take another two jobs, including a minimum wage cleaning role, in order to fund her daughter's expensive habits. 'I am soft with the girls,' says Jackie, who also has a younger daughter named Rachel. 'I know  that I'm soft and even my friends will say: ""Say no to them Jackie!"" but I can't.' Jackie, who says her philosophy on finance boils down to 'if you've got it, spend it', is currently on the hunt for a fourth job but says making her daughters happy is worth it. 'Lauren just loves shopping but then so do I,' she adds. 'She probably gets that from me. If you've got it, spend it - that's what I say. 'Nine times out of 10, she does get it, to be fair. She's got me wrapped round her finger somehow.' Lauren herself is unabashed about her spendthrift ways and cheerfully describes herself as 'spoilt'. 'I think my friends would describe me as spoilt and I don't disagree with them because I know I am,' she laughs. Hard at work: Her mother Jackie works three different jobs in order to fund her daughter's lavish spending . Tough job: Along with her main job as a carer, Jackie also does a minimum wage cleaning job to stay afloat . Lavish: Lauren's extensive shoe collection includes a pair of £75 Hunter wellies that she has never worn . 'I do feel quite guilty because it's just money wasted. I don't know how much [my shoes] cost because my mum just buys them for me. 'She buys them and I don't ask. I just say thank you. I know my mum is a pushover, and I'm not going to lie, it's just because she's really soft and she agrees to most stuff.' Although Lauren, who says she'll spend 'whatever money I can get', does have a paper round to help fund her shopping addiction, it certainly isn't your average job. 'I do half of it - maybe 10 papers,' says Jackie, who helps Lauren do her paper round. 'Lauren does 14. But then Lauren gets the money and I don't get any.' 'I do it in the car with my . mother because it's easier and and the bag is quite heavy sometimes,' reveals an unabashed Lauren. 'Lots of people don't think it's OK . that my mum helps me with my paper round but I am grateful for her . doing it with me because I don't think I'd still be doing it now if she wasn't with me.' Shopping trip: Lauren says she feels under pressure to look good and always wear trendy outfits . TV star: Lauren (centre right) appears on Channel 5's The 12 Year Old Shopaholic and Other Big Spending Kids . Despite Lauren's big spending habits and paper round demands, Jackie says it's all worth it thanks to the confidence boost it gives her daughter. 'Lauren's totally different when we go . out shopping,' she explains. 'She's so full of energy and we have a good time and laugh . and joke...It gives her a lift,  I think, for that short while.' 'I do feel pressurised when I see people in magazines,' says Lauren. 'They look . like normal people but they're really pretty and they're wearing all new . clothes, so you think, oh if I wear those, I'll look really good as . well. 'Girls feel a lot more better when they're in with the trends and getting new stuff,' she adds. 'I . know that my mum does [spend too much] but it's her decision. She gets it . out of her pocket, she pays for it and I don't force her to do it.' Lauren and Jackie appear on The 12 Year Old Shopaholic and Other Big Spending Kids, tonight at 10.30pm on Channel 5 .","Lauren Walsh, 15, from Morecambe, has a lavish designer wardrobe .

"By . Binky Felstead . Hi everyone!! I've decided to do something a little bit different for my blog this week. Before I left for New York I tested out a few home treatment machines and these are a few of my favourites. As you all know I love a salon beauty treatment but there's also nothing like having a few mean machines to use at home. I have a special guest in this week's YouTube video! Mummy came along and also gave her opinion on one of her most loved home treatment machines. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Binky is joined by her mother, Jane Felstead to share their favourite at-home spa treatments . BINKY'S FAVOURITE HOME TREATMENT MACHINES . CACI MICROLIFT . How it works: . To set up your CACI Microlift, take your fresh electro buds, hold with the pink line upwards, snap along the pink line and turn up side down ensuring all the serum is absorbed. Bend the plastic bud and insert into the machine. Repeat for all four. To pick your preferred treatment press the program button, you can choose between toning and wrinkles. It will flash once it’s on your chosen treatment. Next choose the treatment intensity clicking the mode button you can choose low, medium or high. Again it will flash once it’s on your chosen intensity level. The Caci Microlift can help with toning your skin whilst reducing wrinkles . If you are doing the toning treatment the machine needs to be in the open position. If you are doing the wrinkle treatment the machine need to locked closed. Now you've done that click the start button and off you go. With the wrinkle treatment you use the eraser method. It’s basically a zig-zag motion. You can do this technique on your forehead, eyes, middlebrow, cheeks, upper lip, chin, jawline and neck. Each pass should last around 30 seconds. You know to move on to another treatment section when the beeps speed up. With the toning treatment you use the pinching method. You pinch the area you wish to treat ensuring not clasp to hard and hold for six seconds. You should do each section twice. Again you will know when to move on to another treatment section when the beeps speed up. You should do this on your jaw line, cheeks, brows, middle brow and by the corner of you eye where you may see crows feet. Why I love it: . It’s like a face work out! You have to work out your face muscles like you do in the gym with your body – it helps keep your face plump and firm. It’s also great for stimulating collagen and energizing the skin, this is one for all ages. Mummy says that this has worked wonders for her! The CACI Microlift costs £349.00 and is available at: www.caci-microlift.co.uk . PMD . How it works: . Before use ensure your skin is fully cleansed and dry – it is important to ensure your skin is dry or the disk won’t glide smoothly. This machine is very easy to operate you simply connect the power cord and turn it on. Firstly test it on the back of your hand with the white disk to get use to the feeling. (Your machine will come to you with the white disk already attached). The white disk is for testing and your first initial treatments. The PMD is great for reviving dry skin . It is best to use the white disk first and once you have got used to the feeling and how your skin reacts to the treatment, you can progress to the other disks. The blue disks are for sensitive skin and the green for medium abrasion. Smaller disks are for use on the face and larger ones for use on your body. Once you are happy with the feel you are ready for the treatment. Pull your skin taught and glide over never do more the two passes over the same area. Once you have finished your treatment follow up with a neutralizing toner to restore your skin’s PH and then moisturize. Why I love it: . After using the PMD for a couple of weeks I noticed my skin was glowing, blemishes had completely disappeared and my skin felt very soft. The machine comes with an instruction CD and after having a look I felt like a pro! This is very easy to use, and I can definitely say it is worth the money. The PMD costs  £150 and can be purchased from Harrods and www.personalmicroderm.co.uk . REMINGTON I-LIGHT PRO FACE & BODY . How it works: . Before use, ensure your chosen treatment area is shaved, clean and dry. Use skin tone sensor to check your skin is suitable for use. If your skin is treatable your machine will bleep and switch on. Next you choose your desired energy level there are five, you can choose the level that is most comfortable for you. Binky says the Remington i-Light Pro Face & Body is perfect for de-fuzzing . Place over your chosen treatment area at right angles and press the flash button to activate. For large areas, hold the flash button for constant flashes every two seconds. This machine can be used on your arms, legs, bikini line and underarms. There is also a separate head to enable you to use it on your face below your cheekbones. After three treatments you should see permanent results. Why I love it: . This is the perfect de-fuzzing tool. Its painless and the results are amazing. After using this machine around three to four times I started to notice that I did not have to shave as much. Any hairs that grow back were very fine and could easily go unnoticed. Using the Remington i-Light Pro Face & Body will save you many an expensive trip to the salon. The Remington i-Light Pro Face & Body costs 324.99 and is available at www.remington.co.uk and Boots. CLARISONIC ARIA . How it works: . Manually cleanse your skin before use, I personally use Halo Eye Make Up Remover Wipes. To start apply a cleanser to either a damp brush or your skin and simply press start on your machine.Move the machine in a circular motion to cleanse. The Aria has three levels of speed, low, medium and high. Each speed offers a deeper level of cleansing. To change the speed, click the up and down buttons on the machine. The Clarisonic offers an excellent facial cleanse . For the perfect cleanse each Aria is in built with a timer, which guides you through four sections of your face. It beeps letting you know when to move on to a different section of your face. The Aria’s factory setting timer is set for a 1 minute cycle which allows 10 seconds on each cheek, 20 seconds for your forehead and 20 seconds on the middle of your face (nose and chin). For a longer cycle you can change to a two-minute cycle by pressing and holding the up button whilst the machine is off. Why I love it: . The Clarisonic Aria is a great machine to use day and night as part of your beauty regime. The bristles are quite soft but effective, it feels like a toothbrush on the skin. I love the extra glow that comes with using the machine for a prolonged period of time. The Clarisonic Aria costs £155 and is available at http://www.clarisonic.co.uk .

"By . Deni Kirkova . Sales of prosecco have increased by more than 90 per cent, making it nearly twice as popular as champagne. Experts say wine-lovers are more aware now than at any other time about what they are buying when it comes to bubbly, . The . Italian fizz market has almost doubled in the past year; while sales . of champagne are falling flat, taking a nosedive of 16 per cent over the . same period. Sales of Italian fizz have increased by more than 90 per cent making it nearly twice as popular as champagne . However branded and retailer-exclusive . champagnes fared better, being up 4 per cent making the champagne market . worth £280million. Market research also revealed that the worldwide revenue of own-label Italian sparkling wine grew from £50.2million to £95.4million from January 2013 to January 2014. Prosecco's performance is also outshining cava - the UK cava market is currently worth £169million, down from £175million from last year. The International Wine and Spirit . Competition announced the Northern Hemisphere results on Monday at the . start of the London Wine Fair and the highest achievers for own-label prosecco were the following retailers: . The research comes from Nielson, a key authority in market . research for all grocery. The data is taken on take-home sales only and . it is based on all products sold and scanned through the tills in UK . supermarkets. Canti Prosecco Brut, £6, and Freixenet Cordon Negro Cava, £7.99, are two of Bring A Bottle's top sellers . Rosie Davenport, Editor of Off Licence News magazine who published the Nielson research, said: . 'What we are seeing is that the very cheap own label . champagne is definitely being eroded by prosecco. 'Italian fizz has become a more sophisticated option and moved away from the very sweet styles into an everyday drink that's fashionable; but also a fun and sociable option that you can . open and enjoy with friends at any time - and certainly isn't only . reserved for special occasions. 'Consumers are finding it more accessible and are preferring the style, . however they are still buying into the more established champagne brands. 'This has hit some of the cheaper champagnes, though there are signs that the more well-known names are holding their own, and, if anything, the prosecco effect has helped by opening up the world of sparkling wines and champagnes to a new set of consumers. 'Italian fizz has moved into an everyday drink that's fashionable but also a fun and sociable option' The figures show the total Italian sparkling sector is worth £229.3 million. A spokesperson for supermarket wine, beers and spirits price comparison site, bringabottle.co.uk, said: . 'As far as the quality goes it definitely has been improving for the past five or so years, and the sales reflect that. 'Some of the top sparkling recommendations from the wine experts over the Christmas period (traditionally the best selling time) were for prosecco rather than champagne. 'In the battle for the sparkling wines (champagne, prosecco, cava and the New World) prosecco is the closest to champagne; cava being slightly less sweet and having more bubbles. 'Consumers are more aware than at any other time that 'champagne' is just another term for sparkling wine (albeit produced in the champagne region) and that the prices do not necessarily reflect the quality of the product. 'The champagne houses and supermarkets are reacting to the rise in prosecco sales and some of the biggest champagne brands prices were reduced by slightly more than 50 per cent over the Christmas period in order to make champagne more appealing to consumers who would otherwise be buying prosecco and other sparkling wines.' •    The taste profile of prosecco is . slightly different to champagne. There are many styles available, however . typically prosecco is sweeter and lighter, which has helped its broader . appeal. •    The production methods in champagne and prosecco are . different as is the aging process and the length of time it has been . matured, which effects the taste.

Not, as she's at pains to point out, that everything is bad. 'What I always say is that my children have really benefited,' the Secret WAG revealed in an exclusive interview with MailOnline. 'They are really privileged and we remind them every day how lucky they are. I have travelled a lot and have been lucky enough to see some amazing places - and it's all because of his wages.' But while she enjoys a £7,000 monthly allowance and lives a jet set lifestyle, the Secret WAG also tells of having to endure girls throwing themselves at her husband, putting her own career ambitions on hold and having to be prepared to relocate at the drop of a hat. 'We were once in this bar together and this girl was really intoxicated and she was just throwing herself at [my husband] and she had her arm round his waist,' recalls the Secret WAG. Glamorous: International WAG Bouchra van Persie (left) and Wayne and Coleen Rooney (right) Supporting her man: Frank Lampard's fiancee Christine Bleakley cheers her man on during the 2010 World Cup . 'I was stood right next to him and that's when I find it disrespectful. When they are really good looking it does make you feel insecure.' Luckily, her husband, who was once caught out in a tabloid kiss and tell - a story that the Secret WAG says wasn't true - has developed a strategy for seeing them off. 'He has his own way of being polite but firm and he won't play up to the girls,' she explains. 'He lets them know when they've crossed the line.' Nevertheless, she says the constant gaggle of girls that surround her husband, understandably, do make her nervous. 'I would be a fool to trust him 100 per cent,' she admits. 'Footballers don't have a great reputation with all the cheating that's . reported in the papers. 'There are always going to be doubts in my mind. But I don't think he's cheating, I’m 100 per cent about that.' Scandalous: Although now with Irina Shayk, Ronaldo has been on the end of tabloid sex scandals in the past . Ready for action: England training at the Urca Military Base in Rio ahead of their opening game on Saturday . While girls in nightclubs and paps lurking about outside the door are downsides of the WAG way of life, upsides include glamorous holidays as well as the chance to accompany their men on international tours. 'I do enjoy being away on tour,' admits the Secret WAG, who grew up in a football-loving middle class family and loved going to matches with her father as a child. 'There is a real buzz when the stadium is packed and it’s very exciting. I do enjoy football, I love watching England and I'm really . looking forward to the World Cup. 'But,' she adds, 'it does dictate my life and my . husband’s. We aren't always living where we want to live and he has . ended up missing birthdays and christenings and Christmas.' There's also the issue of sex before a game which, according to the Secret WAG, really is banned in the hours leading up to a big match. 'There . is this unwritten rule of no sex before the game,' she laughs. 'I don't know who said . it - probably a woman who's not very horny.

'I think you’re fine . the night before, although maybe not just before the game. You might wear him out but that depends on his performance, I suppose.' More troublesome are the other WAGs, who, as the secret WAG reveals in her book, can be a daunting bunch to begin with. Nevertheless, she says she resents the WAG stereotype and adds that many have careers and charity work that they're rarely credited for. 'There are a few who do conform, who get great satisfaction from . getting a new car or a designer handbag and who are really . materialistic,' she explains. 'But there are a lot who aren't like that who are . tarnished with the same brush. I know a lot of lovely WAGS who are . mothers who will go to the playground with their kids and aren't all . about the glitz and glamour. 'WAGS are never recognised for the good they . do only the bad - a lot of us are involved in charity work and I really . try to get involved as much as possible.' With the World Cup kicking off in Brazil, she's unlikely to have much spare time for charity work over the next month, although she is looking forward to seeing how the world responds to her warts and all memoir. 'I wanted to share the reality of being a . WAG,' she explains. 'It's my story and it goes way back over the years, from my upbringing . to how I've progressed. It definitely isn't all glitz and glamour!'

"By . Lucy Waterlow . In terms of her fame, Fanny Murray could be described as the Kim Kardashian of her day. Women coveted her curvaceous figure and fashion sense while men lusted after her beauty and wit. She was painted, gossiped about and inspired the character Fanny Hill in John Cleland's scandalous novel, Memoirs Of A Woman Of Pleasure. But while Kim Kardashian rose to fame through reality TV, Fanny's notoriety was thanks to her salacious career -  she was Britain's most desired courtesan. Beauty: Women wanted to copy Fanny's style while men lusted after her . Her lovers included some of the 18th century's most noble and rich men, including The Earl of Sandwich, the Baronet of Clapham and the Honourable John Spencer - an ancestor of Princess Diana. She was even rumoured to have counted royalty among her many conquests. Now Fanny's 'classic tale of rags to riches' is being revealed in a new book by Barbara White. In her biography, Queen of the Courtesans, White explains how Fanny was born into a poor family in Bath in 1729. She became a flower-seller to help support her family but it seemed by the age of 13, her beauty had captured people's attention and she then started selling 'a lot more than just posies'. Whether her family were aware and condoned her activities was unclear but 'by the age of 15, she was to become Bath's most valuable export to London's sex trade.' Inspiration: The character Fanny Hill in John Cleland's Memoirs Of A Woman Of Pleasure (which as been dramatised by the BBC as pictured) was thought to be based on Fanny Murray . She became the 'personification of glamour and excess' and her 'voluumptous figure drove men wild with desire'. Although she wasn't a traditional beauty, she was famed for her pretty face and her cleavage, with her breasts once described by one of her many admirers as 'orbs of snowy whiteness'. In the book, White describes Fanny as 'a phenomenon in her own time' and 'the supremely successful courtesan of her day.' She was the 'toast of the town' and her sexual prowess was highly sought after by the wealthiest men. She was known to have been 'chased by princes' including King George II's son Prince William - but White writes that evidence of whether . they actually became lovers is rare. What is well-documented is how much of a celebrity Fanny became. Pin up: Men would carry prints and engravings of her while those rich enough had her portrait painted . Queen of the courtesans: Barbara White has written about Fanny's incredible life . White writes how 'reputable women could not receive her in company yet they aped her fashion sense, and male admirers bought pin ups of her in the form of mezzotints (a form of printed image) and engravings.' As well her her beauty and sex life, Fanny also became famed for her spirited personality. Most famously, she once humiliated Sir Robert Atkins when he offered to pay her £20 (about £2,400 today), telling him: 'Damn your twenty pound! What does it signify?' She then put the note between two slices of bread and ate it as a sandwich. White writes that this 'represented the kind of breathtaking bravado that every courtesan wishes she had thought of first'. But after eight years of notoriety, Fanny then settled down by marrying the Scottish actor David Ross and reinvented herself as a dutiful spouse. However, White notes that Fanny's mid-life change of character did nothing to alter the way she went down in history, concluding: 'She's remembered not as a faithful wife of twenty years standing but as a symbol of promiscuity and immortality.' Queen of the Courtesans by Barbara White, was published this month by The History Press .","Fanny Murray was 18th century celebrity .

"By . Martha Cliff . All parents have had that feeling of dread when their kids ask them something they just don't know how to answer. 'Where do babies come from?' being a particularly common query that parents find hard to tackle. However, research shows that a worrying amount of children are becoming too scared to ask the awkward questions that they need to discuss with their parents. A survey revealed today that more than one in four children (27 per cent) have admitted to keeping problems and worries to themselves because they don't know how to tell their parents. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Presenter Cherry Healey, shared her daughter's uncomfortable question for the Railway Children project . The survey conducted by the charity Railway Children, partners with Aviva shows that many parents are unaware of the problem with 95 per cent believing that they are very approachable when it comes to tackling difficult subjects. However research contradicted this, revealing that many parents aren't broaching subjects such as family changes, divorce and death with their children. Out of 500 parents surveyed a quarter of parents (24 per cent) said that they hadn’t talked about family changes with their children, while one in five (22 per cent) hadn’t approached difficult subjects like death or suicide. Nearly a third (31 per cent) admitted that they would only deal with a difficult conversation with their child if the issue arises. This comes as a concern as research shows that children who experience disruption such as divorce, are three times more likely to run away from home, highlighting the importance of discussing tricky subjects with children. Andy McCullough, Head of UK Policy & Public Affairs at Railway Children, which supports vulnerable young people alone and at risk on Britain’s streets says that this is not uncommon problem. 'Every five minutes a child runs away from home in the UK. That's 100,000 children under 16 every year. These children run away for a variety of reasons such as problems experienced at school, relationship issues or family breakdown.' Awkward: In their promotional video Railway Children and Aviva document some of the more embarrassing questions parents get asked . Cringe: The campaign encourages parents to have an open dialogue with their children no matter how awkward their questions may be . Ermmmm...Although questions may be difficult to answer Railway Child say that having open conversations now will help children approach their parents with more serious problems when they're older . Andy continues to emphasise the importance of proactively discussing issues with young children in order to avoid such problems. 'Not having someone to talk to about these problems can result in feelings of desperation and helplessness for a child, which could lead them to think about running away from home. 'For any parent, discovering that your child has run away from home is the worst possible nightmare. But talking to your child and having open conversations, regardless of how awkward they might be, may be all it takes to prevent them from considering running away from home.' The survey . also highlighted that two in five children (40 per cent) reported an . overwhelming sense of loneliness and isolation when they don’t have . anyone to talk to. The . issues that 11-16 year olds are finding most difficult to discuss with . their parents include sex (36 per cent), romantic relationships (30 per . cent) and body image (19 per cent), with a quarter of children saying . that their parents have never tried to bring up these issues at all. Serious side: The video also highlights that children do have worries and doubts that need to be discussed with their parents . Concerning: Research shows that many kids turn to the Internet for answers because they feel like they can't talk to their parents . With no one else to turn to many of these children are relying on modern technology to help them rather than their own family with one in five (21 per cent) turning to the Internet for answers. Psychiatrist Dr Sandra Scott says that having open discussions is vital in children's development. 'Every parent will know that having awkward conversations is a necessary part of parenting. But establishing an open and honest pattern of communication between parents and children from a young age is incredibly important. 'For parents, maintaining this for the future when their children grow older and face different, and more difficult, challenges, lets them know they always have someone to confide in.' 'Talking to your child and having open . conversations, regardless of how awkward they might be, may be all it . takes to prevent them from considering running away from home' Andy McCullough . The charity Railway are asking parents to upload their most awkward parenting conversation at www.avivaconversations.co.uk to help raise awareness of the importance of an honest, open dialogue and pledge to continue tackling tricky subjects. For every conversation included in the Awkward Conversations hub and/or any share directly from the hub, Aviva will donate £2 to Railway Children, up to a maximum of £100,000 or until the campaign closes on 25 August. Heather Smith, Marketing Director of General Insurance at Aviva believes that communication between parent and child is a necessity when it comes to tackling homelessness in children. '100,000 children run away from home in the UK each year and the true extent and scale of the problem is hidden and more can, and should, be done to address this. 'Through our work with Railway Children, we know that tackling tough conversations is vital to ensure children don’t become isolated and feel that running away is their only option. We are proud to be working closely with Railway Children and the money raised will provide much needed funding to support their continued work in the UK, helping vulnerable young people alone and at risk on Britain’s streets.'

"By . Katy Winter . A bride-to-be from Hull who last year wouldn’t have been be found within a mile of a gym, is now a self confessed exercise addict who has found so much fulfillment from her training that she’s asked her personal trainer to be a witness at her wedding. Gillian Shaw, 32, has lost over four stone since she began first took her first tentative steps into exercising last April with personal trainer, Tom Cowen, with the aim of trimming down for her wedding this August. Weighing in at 15st, Gillian was a dress size 18-20, and had warnings from her doctor she was at risk of becoming diabetic. Gillian's total lack of exercise and unhealthy diet of fast food saw her weight rise to 15st and she was warned she good develop diabetes . Now, after just over a year, Gillian  weighs 10st 8lb and has reached her target dress size 8-10 . 'Before starting the gym I was lazy from overeating and lack of exercise. Everyday was a struggle, I'd avoid activities and joining in things from the fear getting out of breath and embarrassment. 'Being the size I was walking running and even stairs where a struggle. 'Joining a gym was the last thing on my mind out of fear and anxiety from being the size I was and getting looked at.' Gillian joined the gym in January but couldn’t turn down the crisps, cakes and takeaways, and her weight continued to rise. Three months later Gillian decided enough was enough and, determined to fit into her dream size 8 wedding dress, she began training sessions with personal trainer Tom, twice a week and took on a total diet overhaul. Now, after just over a year Gillian weighs 10st 8lb and has reached her target dress size 8-10. Gillian and Tom got on so well during training sessions that they’ve become close friends and Gillian truly values how Tom has helped her to change her attitude towards food.

Fear and embarrassment over her size meant Gillian used to be scared of going to the gym . With Tom . guiding her at every step of her weight loss in preparation for her big . day, Gillian felt it was only right to ask him to be witness at her . wedding. Gillian said: 'I obviously needed the guidance that Tom gave me, when I was going to the gym by myself I wasn’t shifting any weight at all. 'I couldn’t have done it without him. Tom is such a lovely guy, he really pushes me but most importantly he’s believed in me. Trainer Tom has become so close to Gillian during her transformation he is going to be a witness at her wedding . 'I have him to thank for the size I’ll be on my wedding day, which is why I want him there as a witness.” Tom is so proud of Gillian’s achievements that he recently booked her in for a surprise full make-over so Gillian could really see how much she’s changed in the past year. 'I’m immensely proud of Gill, and I wanted to do something for her to give her a little reward for her determination. I got in contact with a local beauty salon to ask if they could glam her up so everyone could see how amazing she really looks. 'The transformation is amazing and the smile says it all. I’m honoured to have a part in it.' 'I set Gillian on a strict healthy eating plan, getting rid of any starchy carbs and sugars from her diet. 'Gillian used to skip meals which effectively ruined her metabolism, so I had her eating little and often to repair the damage. Eating this way gave her more fuel for work outs.'

"By . Misty White Sidell . A web-based fashion company has recreated the world’s oldest pants, which were discovered in China earlier this year, dating back to at least 1,000B.C. Betabrand’s prototype called ‘World’s Oldest Pants’ is currently up for vote on the site as an item being considered for production. They have modernized the drop-crotch style pants with lightweight fabric, utilizing the same groin patch, color, and pattern as the ancient original. Modern interpretation: Betabrand's World's Oldest Pants aim to recreate the 3,000-year-old pants that were discovered in China earlier this year . The original: The pants, which date back to 1,000 B.C. (pictured) are said to confirm speculations that pants were invented to protect the human form as it commuted on horseback . The style will retail for somewhere . between $75 and $100 - Betabrand owner Chris Lindland tells MailOnline - . if the pants receive the necessary 300 votes to move forward. At present, the pants have received 162 votes with ten days left for users to weight in. The original pants were discovered in Xinjiang (an autonomous region in Northwest China) on the bodies of two men approximately aged 40 (both suspected to be warriors as well as herders) who belonged to the nomadic Subeixi culture. As was previously long speculated by fashion historians, the pants’ discovery nearly confirms how the garment’s invention came about in an effort to protect the human form as it commuted on horseback. Their discovery was first announced in a May 22 edition of Qauternary International, with vivid imagery of the torn garments which have maintained a miraculous shape, despite their 3,000-year-old age. In the details: Betabrand has gone to great lengths to recreate the pants, including their signature cut-out crotch patch . In addition to historical connotations, Betabrand feels that the pants also demonstrate how the Subeixi ‘wanted to make a bold fashion statement,’ facetiously pointing out the relics’ ‘distressed retro styling’ and ‘classic dual-drawstring action’. The site, which is famous for its community-invented wares that range from office-appropriate yoga pants to pinstripe ‘executive’ hoodies, often relies upon an item’s comments section to help shape an item’s final outcome. In reference to World’s Oldest Pants these comments range from ‘will they smell authentic?’ to more useful ones like Dadalus Westland’s input, which reads: ‘Looks like the crotch piece was a heavier weight fabric to stand up to the abuse of horseback riding, and maybe act a little like padding. That should be kept in mind.’ Ron Jarvis struck a chord somewhere in the middle with his comment: ‘Cool yes, but it could still use a codpiece, just saying.’","Betabrand's World's Oldest Pants are a modern version of the 3,000-year-old pants found in China earlier this year .

"By . Margot Peppers . Taking a stand: Jennifer Lahl (pictured), a former pediatric critical care nurse, has made it her mission to get surrogacy federally outlawed . A woman has made it her mission to get surrogacy - the carrying of a pregnancy by a third party for intended parents - federally outlawed in the U.S. Jennifer Lahl, who has 25 years' experience as a pediatric critical care nurse, told ABC News that separating a child from its birth mother is morally reprehensible because it creates a 'primal wound'. 'It always . strikes me that the children are so absent in the discussions,' said the 56-year-old, who has written in the past about why surrogacy and IVF are not Christian concepts. 'It's all about adults - who wants, who needs, who . buys and what I can get.' In her new . documentary, Breeders: A Sub-Class of Women, she cites several examples . of surrogacy gone wrong, arguing that these are proof that the practice . has flaws and that its legality should be reevaluated. One . example used by Ms Lahl, who has three college-age daughters of her . own, is a woman from Minnesota who carried a child for a same-sex couple . and then fought for visitation rights when the baby was born. In the . film, the woman reveals that when the girl was older, she asked her: . 'Why did you give me away, when we look alike, but you kept the other . children?' Another woman says in a trailer for the documentary: 'It's not just her uterus that she's renting, it's her entire body.' Ms Lahl, who is president of the Center for Bioethics and Culture in San Francisco, also asserts that the practice of surrogacy unfairly benefits the wealthy who can afford it, while exploiting those of lesser means. Indeed, the entire process including in vitro fertilization, donor eggs, legal fees and compensation for the surrogate can cost upwards of $100,000, according to Barbara Collura, the executive director of RESOLVE: The National Infertility Association. 'It's obviously expensive technology and people with financial means want what they want,' said Ms Lahl. Of course, . not all surrogacy experiences have had negative outcomes. Jacey Spratt, . 38, said having twins via a gestational surrogate, her college roommate, . was 'the culmination of technology and love.' After a . strep infection made her unable to carry children on her own, a doctor . told Ms Spratt that surrogacy was her best bet, even though it cost a . total of $40,000. Criticism: Ms Lahl claims that surrogacy does not take into consideration the moral implications for the child, and that it unfairly benefits the wealthy while exploiting the poor . But for parents desperate to have a child, the process is undoubtedly worth every penny. 'Everyone along the journey was great,' said the proud mom. 'You need to see a picture of my daughters to see the happiness that this has brought to our lives.' Still, the monetary factor does remain an ethical debate, with different states enforcing different rules. In California, contracted surrogacy is . allowed for domestic partnerships. Tennessee, on the other hand, where . same-sex marriage is banned, only allows married couples to have . surrogacy agreements. 'It always strikes me that the children are so absent in the discussions, it's all about adults' In Nebraska and Maryland, surrogacy is legal, so long as the surrogate is not paid. And legislation in New York also bans surrogacy compensation. But according to Ms Collura, banning surrogacy is a backwards step for society. 'Medical advances now allow people to see who were blind; people to walk who lost legs; and people to live lives that a few years ago no one thought was possible,' she said. 'We have the medical technology to allow people to become parents, and why should we simply ban it?' Ms Lahl has also voiced her criticism of other assisted reproductive technologies including egg donation, sperm donation and IVF. 'Christians still need to look more carefully at today's reproductive technologies such as IVF in light of our beliefs about God, life, our bodies, and our children,' she wrote in a 2013 Christianity Today piece.

"By . Lucy Waterlow . Celebrities including Wag Coleen Rooney are well-known for bragging about their other halves on social media. Earlier this month, Coleen Tweeted a selfie of her and husband Wayne on their wedding anniversary with the comment: 'Six years ago today I became Mrs Rooney! Through all the good times and some bad... We are stronger than ever.' But while such public declarations of affection might make boost your partner's ego, they won't help your own popularity, according to new research. A study published in the Science of Relationships found that people who posted pictures of themselves and their partners looking lovey dovey, or who made gushing status updates about their other half, were disliked by their friends. So in love, so annoying: Selfies with your partner and gushing updates, like this one recently posted by Coleen Rooney, are disliked . It seems frequently boosting about your love - which can also be done by changing your relationship status on Facebook - is a means of making your friends mad. This is what the researchers discovered for their paper which will be published in the journal Personal Relationships. They asked more than 200 people who were in relationships to give them access to their Facebook profile. They found that more than a quarter had profile pictures showing them with their partner and 70 per cent had changed their relationship status to reflect their love life. The researchers were then asked to judge how satisfied and committed they thought each person was in their relationship, based on their Facebook profile. Spare us! Researchers found people disliked status updates were people talked too much about their partner . Those who had profile pictures with their partners and who displayed their relationship status were deemed to have 'higher quality' relationships. Each of the people who had shared their Facebook pages with the researchers were also asked to answer a questionnaire on how satisfied they were in their relationship. The answers reflected the assumptions the researchers had made based on the Facebook profiles - the people who had pictures with their partners and shared their relationship status were found to be the most satisfied and committed based on their questionnaire answers. Therefore the researchers concluded that a relationship is perceived to be 'better' if someone makes a show of it on their Facebook page. However, the next part of their study found it doesn't make you a better friend. The researchers next created a variety of fictional Facebook profiles, with some using profile pictures of couples and displaying their current relationship status. What does your profile say about your relationship? Those who had a profile picture with the partner were deemed to be more content . They also made up status updates revealing various levels of disclosure about their fictional relationship. High disclosure included status updates such as 'Pining away for Jordan… I just love you so much I can't stand it!' Coleen's Tweet as above would also fall under 'high disclosure' category. Low disclosure included statuses that were about a relationship but impersonal eg 'I love my girlfriend' while no relationship disclosure covered statuses like 'I've lost my mobile, email me'. People were then asked to judge each fictional Facebook profile and decide which were the most satisfied in their relationship. They were also asked to rate how much they liked the person whose profile they were viewing. Once again, those with profile pictures of their partners who displayed their relationship status were judged to be the most satisfied. However, those who disclosed too much about their relationship in their status updates were the least popular. Those who had the most 'high disclosure' status updates were particularly disliked. So postings like Coleen's may make people perceive a relationship as successful - but that doesn't mean they'll like you for it.","Researchers judged how content people were in their relationship based on Facebook profile .

"By . Anna Pursglove . Dreaded dimpling: Even stars . such as Kim Cattrall suffer . Cellulite is the scourge of summer fashion. It forces us to wrap sarongs around swimsuits and wear nude tights under floaty dresses (even on swelteringly hot days). In short, anything to avoid putting puckered thighs and buttocks on display. Nature has been particularly unkind when it comes to the distribution of cellulite, because while the dreaded dimpling can afflict even the slimmest of women - a staggering 95 per cent of us suffer from it - it rarely affects men. That's because cellulite isn't really a fat problem; it's a skin problem - specifically, a female one. Under the skin is a layer of fibrous connective tissue that binds it to the muscle. In men, this tissue criss-crosses beneath their slightly thicker skin in a regular pattern. In women, however, the strands of connective tissue run vertically, tethering the skin straight down at certain points, creating clearly defined fat chambers between them - essentially, peaks of fat and troughs of tissue. Hey presto! Instead of nice, smooth skin, you've got unattractive, lumpy, orange peel. However, not all women are cursed in quite the same way. Here are ten surprising triggers that could be making your skin look even more mattress-like - and how you can fight back. Forget the idea that a crash diet will rid you of these unsightly fat deposits - it will actually make them worse. The problem is two-fold. First, if you’re not eating enough protein this can cause water retention, seeing excess fluid filling up the chambers below the skin’s surface just as fat does. Second, repeated weight gain and weight loss compromise the skin’s elasticity, making cellulite more pronounced still. Fight it: Nutrition experts recommend a diet high in healthy proteins (fish, egg, seafood, white meat, beans, nuts and seeds) with a little 'good' carbohydrate (whole grains, vegetables and fruit). Cut out processed carbs such as white bread. Contrary to popular opinion, stress does not make you skinny - it produces the hormone cortisol, which encourages us to lay down fat around the stomach, hips, buttocks and thighs. As if this weren't enough, the fluctuations in female hormones associated with puberty, pregnancy and the menopause make our connective tissue less flexible, meaning it pulls down even harder against the bulging fat. Fight it: Cortisol causes cravings for sweet and/or high-fat foods, so quell cravings with natural ‘good mood foods’ such as berries and nuts - cashews are a good source of zinc, a lack of which has been linked to anxiety and depression. Cigarette smoke has been shown to weaken and disrupt the formation of connective tissue meaning it is more easily damaged, again allowing fat to bulge beneath skin. It also compromises circulation, which encourages water retention and exacerbates cellulite. Fight it: Even e-cigarettes contain nicotine, which compromises blood flow, so if you want to really improve your skin health, you need to give up. Completely. Some painkillers can case water retention which exacerbates cellulite . Again the problem here is with water retention, a side-effect of NSAID (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs), the painkiller category that includes aspirin and ibuprofen. Fluid drains from the body through the lymphatic system and empties back into the bloodstream. Fluid retention happens when it is not fully removed from tissues. Fight it: Most people notice that water retention disappears when they discontinue the painkiller but check with your doctor. If appropriate you could try swapping to a paracetamol-based drug, which shouldn’t make you retain fluid. If your cellulite is particularly bad, sucking the excess fat out of your thighs might sound like an attractive (if extreme) answer, but, in fact, cosmetic surgeons warn liposuction frequently makes fat distribution more uneven, deepening the problem as it increases the peaks and troughs beneath your skin, accentuating cellulite. Fight it: If you're determined to get some help, non-invasive procedures such as Endermologie (which uses vacuum suction and rollers to break up fat with deep massage) and Thermage (which uses radio frequencies to smoothe skin) have been shown to give better results against cellulite. Sitting with your legs crossed for long periods interferes with circulation in the lower limbs by putting pressure on the main vein that runs along the inner thigh. This can cause fluid retention and make cellulite worse. Fight it: Bicycle pedalling is a great exercise to perform at your desk (ignore the looks from your colleagues!). Simply raise your legs and pedal as though you’re on a bike for 30 seconds. Aim to do a morning and an afternoon session. The word cellulite is derived from the French word 'la cellule' which means cell . Just as sunshine ages skin, it can make cellulite worse. The sun's rays trigger a reaction in which molecules called free radicals can weaken cells and connective tissue. Sunburn can also cause water retention because the body responds by secreting toxins, which the kidneys must then work hard to excrete. If your kidneys become overloaded, this results in water being stored in the tissues of the body. Fight it: Use a high-factor SPF all over and re-apply twice daily (most of us don't apply enough - the average adult needs about 85ml, or just under half a bottle, to cover their whole body). Drink plenty of water (it might sound counter-intuitive, but drinking water decreases water retention as it ensures the correct balance of salt and fluids in your body). Tone up: Squat exercises can help . Running around the park may not make your cellulite worse, but it won't sculpt your bottom half, either, unless you include toning exercises. One study found adults who did three 30-minute aerobic workouts a week for eight weeks lost 4lb but gained no muscle.  When they coupled 15 minutes of aerobic activity with 15 minutes of toning exercises three times a week, however, they lost 10lb of fat and added 2lb of muscle. Fight it: Squats are one of the best leg and buttock-toning exercises. Stand with your feet slightly wider than your hips and point your toes outward slightly. Focusing on pushing your bottom backwards and downwards (to keep your knees in line  with your feet), squat down until your hip is lower than your knees. Repeat until you can’t finish the exercise. Ironically, while these are designed to iron out our lumpy, bumpy bits, wearing them regularly could well be making your cellulite more pronounced.  That’s because, if the compression of the garment in any way impedes blood flow or lymph drainage, then you will end up retaining water, making your cellulite noticeably worse. Fight it: Body wraps can temporarily banish water retention - but while your skin may look smoother for a week or so, it won’t get rid of cellulite altogether. If you suffer an allergic reaction your body releases chemicals called histamines, which increase fluid retention as white blood  cells flood to the site of  potential infection. In some cases this can be localised (think of the swelling around an insect bite), but if the allergic reaction is more generalised (for example a food intolerance) then this can lead to water retention. Fight it: If you think you might be bloated as the result of a food intolerance, a nutritional therapist can help you draw up a programme of food elimination to help work out what you are sensitive to.","Even stars such as Kim Cattrall can suffer from the dreaded dimpling .

"By . Ruth Styles . Their faces painted red with crimson ochre and impressive set of brightly coloured feathers swaying on the top of their heads, these Samburu dancers wear elaborate headdresses beautiful enough to put the efforts of the Glastonbury crowd to shame. Living in Kenya's magnificent Rift Valley, a place of towering escarpments, flamingo-filled soda lakes and abundant wildlife, the Samburu are one of the country's most fascinating tribes, famous for their incredible jewellery and interesting customs. And the feather headdresses are symbolic of one particularly important tradition, according to photographer Eric Lafforgue. 'The guys who wear feather headdresses have just been circumcised,' he explains. 'They aren't allowed to meet women.' Spectacular: These Samburu men are recently circumcised, a fact made plain by their elaborate feathered headdresses, and cannot spend time with women . No comparison: Glastonbury goer Ria Hebden might look pretty in her feathered headdress but its not quite as impressive as the ones belonging to the Samburu . What's more, the feather-wearing men aren't the only ones to be banned from enjoying female company. The Loikop, as the Samburu are known . among themselves, live in one of the world's only remaining gerontocracies, . with the power of the tribal elders underpinned by a belief in their . ability to lay curses on miscreants. As a result, they monopolise tribal business, including making arrangements for marriages. With many choosing to take extra wives themselves at the expense of younger men, the elders' rule isn't always popular. Discontent occasionally spills over into discord, with cattle stealing and wife-pinching popular pastimes among the Samburu's bachelor groups forced to live without families. While the odd bout of social strife might make headlines in the local press, abroad, the Samburu are more famous for their beautiful jewellery and have some interesting customs when it comes to choosing what to wear. Striking: A pair of Samburu men show off their elaborate headdresses, created from a mixture of beads, polished ostrich shell and feathers .

Colourful: Along with elaborate feather . headdresses, Samburu and their close kin, the Rendille, also wear piles . of bright beaded jewellery made by the women . Colourful: A man paints his face with make-up - a habit that led to the Samburu tribe being given their name which translates from Maa as 'butterfly' Wonderful: A Samburu man shows off his bright saffron sarong and elaborate jewellery (left) and right, a Samburu . man silhouetted by the setting sun . Striking: A Samburu man shows off his heavy headdress weighted down with scores beads and feathers, and huge, elaborately decorated collar . Until recently, discarding the . traditional tribal loincloth in favour of Western-style trousers was . considered unmanly and as a result, the majority of Samburu men still . wear colourful tartan shukkas as they go about their business. Like their close relations, the Maasai tribe, the men of both Samburu and Rendille tribes also pile on impressive amounts of jewellery, with beaded necklaces, elaborate headdresses and stacks of brightly coloured bracelets all popular. Women too wear huge amounts of jewellery, most famously their ornate beaded collars, and make most of the jewellery, including their menfolks', by hand. Along with the men, they also paint their faces using concoctions made from ground chalk and ochre and use it to accentuate their best features - much to the delight of nearby tribes who gave the Samburu their name, which translates from the Maasai language, Maa, as 'butterfly'. Handmade: All of the headdresses and jewellery worn by Samburu and Rendille men are made by the women of the tribe . Hard work: Most of the elaborate beaded adornments take hours of work to complete, although the traditional collars worn by women take almost as long . Looking good: A Samburu man checks his crimson make-up in an incongruous pink hand mirror, as he gets ready to participate in a traditional circumcision ritual . Tradition: The Samburu's feathered headdresses are better than anything found at Glastonbury, and right, men use ochre to dye their hair red .

Ritual: The beaded headdresses show that the men are going through a traditional circumcision ritual - and cannot be in female company .

But the Maasai too have no shortage of . spectacular jewellery - in particular the incredible enkuraru . headdresses crafted from ostrich feathers and worn by warriors yet to . kill their first lion. Originally created for use during raids and wars, thanks to the psychological advantage offered by their height, most are now worn purely for major ceremonies and dances. Other Kenyan tribes to make the most of the abundance of feathers to be found are the Turkana and the Kalenjin - both of whom live in the arid northwestern reaches of the Rift Valley. The Turkana, whose lands border those of the Pokot people and the Ugandan Karamojong tribe, are famous for their athletic prowess and for their beautiful women - among them Victoria's Secret model Ajuma Nasenyana. Less colourful than the Samburu and the Maasai, the tribe is nevertheless fond of elaborately decorated clothing, with women wearing stunning animal skin tunics embroidered with polished ostrich shell. Men, meanwhile, brighten up their look using crimson dye made from local ochre rocks to colour their hair, and like the throng of people heading to Glastonbury, pile on huge amounts of bright beaded jewellery. But while the Glastonbury crowds' embrace of headdresses and piles of jewellery only lasts four days, for the Turkana, Samburu, Maasai and Kalenjin, gorgeous festival-style jewels are a year-round sight.

"By . Catherine Mortimer . Cakes are a treat most of us can’t resist but for Michelle Allen her cake addiction saw her balloon to 26st 1llb and a size 32. The catering accountant from Chatteris, Cambridgeshire, finally changed her ways after seeing an unflattering photo and lost 17 stone and 9 dress sizes. Michelle, 47, says: ‘I’ve been over weight all my life and I put it down to my sweet tooth. If I wanted a cake I used to have it. But I didn’t stop at one - I would eat the whole pack.’ She estimates she spent £8 on two or three cakes a day and has eaten a whopping £87, 360 in cakes over 30 years before changing her ways. Michelle Allen, who weighed 26 stone at her heaviest, left, has lost 17 stone after giving up sweet treats and cake, right. The former sugar addict claims she spent around £87,000 on cake over 30 years . The slimmer says: ‘Who’d have thought chucking cake down my neck would add up to the cost of a world cruise every year or money towards a bigger house? I’m speechless.’ Thankfully, Michelle is now in better shape since conquering her love of cakes. She joined Cambridge Weight Plan in February 2012 and lost 17st to become a size 12 and 9st 11lb over 18 months. Michelle says her sweet tooth and weight worries started as a child. She says, ‘I was always bigger than my friends when I was at school. Mum used to make me healthy meals but I couldn’t help eating cakes and chocolate in between and I wasn’t very sporty. ‘I was a size 18 when I was 16 and a size 20 when I was 18 and I just kept getting bigger and bigger.’ ‘Luckily, I wasn’t bullied but inside I wished I was as slim as my friends. I resigned myself to thinking maybe I was just a fat person.’ Michelle blames her love of cakes on her first job as a baker between 16 and 24 years old where she got a love for sweet treats from the bakery. She says, ‘I’d bake cakes, doughnuts, tarts, buns, you name it and I have to admit making so many tempting things was too hard to resist.’ ‘People used to come from miles around to get my chocolate eclairs. Baking was a passion of mine and I’d always eat what I made.’ ‘Despite sticking to healthy meals my downfall was that I was a secret eater.’ The catering assistant decided enough was enough after seeing this picture of herself at a wedding. She says she would gorge on cake - eating up to five servings a day . ‘I’d treat myself to two a three cakes a day when I was on a break or at lunch or even on the way home while filling up with petrol or buying dinner so nobody knew how much I’d had.’ When Michelle was 22 and a size 18 she got married to Paul Joslin, 23, an electrician and had their daughter Philippa 2 years later. But the marriage wasn’t a happy one and it broke up when Philippa was six months old. She says, ‘My size was nothing to do with the break up. We grew apart.’ When her daughter was 4 years old Michelle went back to college studying business and six months later become a catering accountant but her love of sweet treats continued. When she was 34 the slimmer met her second husband, Jason Allen, 30, a head caretaker when and a size 22. She confesses, ‘Jason loved me for me and didn’t care about my weight. By my thirties I resigned myself to always being big.’ ‘I was lucky I didn’t have any serious health problems but the extra weight caused me to get red raw skin between my thighs where my legs rubbed and together and I was always tired.’ Everything changed when Michelle was 45 and she went to a friend’s wedding in December 2010. On her previous eating habits, Michelle says: 'I¿d treat myself to two a three cakes a day when I was on a break or at lunch or even on the way home while filling up with petrol or buying dinner so nobody knew how much I¿d had' She says, ‘I was a witness and I’d made a real effort with my hair and make up and I wore a beautiful blue dress with control underwear to hold everything in. I thought I looked nice.’ ‘But when I saw a photo of me I thought I looked like a beached whale or like the Michelin woman because of my many spare tyres.’ The mum-of-one was so shocked she decided to diet. She had the perfect goal in mind too. ‘My niece announced she was getting married in September 2013 and her mum – my sister – had sadly died a few years before. I wanted to slim in time for her big day so she’d be proud of me and I wouldn’t embarrass her.’ That same year Michelle’s daughter Philippa, then 20, had lost 2st on the Cambridge Weight Plan and it inspired the 47-year-old to give it a go too. Michelle joined her local class in March, Cambridgeshire, in February 2012 where she followed a daily diet of three shakes in place of meals. She says, ‘I thought I’d be starving but after a few days I got used to it and the weight dropped off me.’ ‘If I had a hard day my consultant Sue Jones would encourage me. She taught me about non-food rewards like treating yourself to a new top or going and reading a good book. ‘I also found talking to other slimmers on diet forums helped keep me going too.’ The 47-year-old can now stand in one leg of the trousers she used to wear, pictured. She lost her weight by using the Cambridge Weight Plan after her daughter had similar success using the method . The 47-year-old also joined her local gym. Her consultant explained strenuous exercise wasn’t recommended on such a low-calorie plan so Michelle asked a personal trainer, Hayley Powell, to help design a toning programme of light weights and walking on the treadmill twice a week for an hour. She says, ‘Exercise used to be something other people did – then I really got into it and noticed it was paying off.’ 'My tummy was shrinking and my arms and legs looked more toned. I felt much healthier.’ Michelle was losing nearly a stone a month and before long she had to use the smallest hole on her belts to hold her trousers up. By the summer of 2012 she’d shed five stone but hadn’t told anyone about her diet for fear she’d fail and everyone would know. But if she needed any more motivation she was further spurred on when she visited a friend’s house and went to sit down on a plastic chair in the garden. She recalls, ‘The chair went crunch and it broke!’ ‘It was so embarrassing. I couldn’t believe it. Everyone was nice about it but I was horrified.’ Shortly after she also split her trousers while sitting at home on the sofa. On her new lifestyle and fantastic figure, Michelle says: ' I love shopping now and I buy anything I fancy instead of worrying if it'll fit or be slimming enough' She recalls, ‘I was determined to keep losing weight after that.’ By November 2013 the accountant had shrunk from a size 32 to a size 12 and lost 17st. She gradually phased out her daily shakes and began eating healthily with the help of her consultant. To her delight the weight stayed off. Michelle is still a regular at the gym and goes four times a week for an hour and a half. It means she can callow herself a treat of the occasional slice of cake. She says, ‘If it’s a special occasion I’ll let myself have a cake or some chocolate but I make sure I have a small amount and don’t go back for seconds.’ ‘Being slim has made my confidence soar. I look and feel like a different person and I’m not going back to being 26 stone again.’ The 47-year-old has treated herself to some new clothes. She says, ‘I’ve got lots of dresses now in all shapes and sizes. I love shopping now and I buy anything I fancy instead of worrying if it’ll fit or be slimming enough.’ But the biggest treat of all is being able to look in the mirror and see a new, super slim person staring back at her. What’s more, Michelle reached her goal of slimming in time for her niece’s wedding last year. She recalls, ‘I fitted in a beautiful size 12 dress by the time her big day came round. It felt great. ‘Unlike the photo from my friend’s wedding, these snaps are ones to be proud of. ‘I even enjoyed a slice of wedding cake – I just made sure it was a small one’ Breakfast: Bowl of Honey Nut Cheerios, 3 slices of toast with butter and jam. Lunch: Two sandwiches, crisps and a muffin. Snacks: Cup of tea and a slice of cake. Dinner: Big plate of Spaghetti Bolognese, chips and salad, a slice of apple pie. Late evening: Cup of tea and a slice of cake. Breakfast: Porridge with skimmed milk, 1 piece of fruit. Mid-morning: apple. Lunch: Chicken salad and a skinny late. Mid-afternoon: nothing.

"By . Chris Waugh . The Birmingham Bears go in search of their first ever Twenty20 trophy on Finals Day on Saturday and Chris Woakes is confident they can upset the odds at home. The Bears face Surrey in the last four, with Hampshire and Lancashire Lightning meeting in the other semi-final tie at Edgbaston but despite their consistent form across all three formats this season - they are third in the County Championship and in the quarter-finals of the Royal London Cup - Woakes insists his side are underdogs. The 25-year-old all-rounder, who has taken four wickets and scored 28 runs in four Twenty20 matches this season, said: 'You could say we just snuck in the back door, qualifying fourth in the group. But you could also say we peaked at the right time. High fives: The Birmingham Bears beat the Essex Eagles in the NatWest Blast T20 Finals Day . First semi-final: Surrey v Birmingham (11am) Second semi: Hampshire v Lancashire (2.30pm) Final at 6.45pm . 'It's my first finals day. I have been as a spectator before but never as a player. 'It should be a great experience and anyone can win it on the day - it's just whoever turns up. 'We face Surrey in the semi-finals and they have some world-class players throughout their team. It's on our home ground as well, and we have to take some confidence from that. 'Hampshire have been very strong this year and on paper they are probably most people's favourite for the title. Lancashire have some big players coming back though - particularly in James Anderson and Jos Buttler - so they will be no pushovers. 'Whoever qualifies from that other semi-final is going to be a tough task. But we have to concentrate on Surrey first.' Opening up: Having Varun Chopra and Will Porterfield (below) at the top of the order gives the Bears confidence . Hopeful: Chris Woakes could return for the Bears but Jonathan Trott (right) is sweating on a place . Despite Woakes trying to play down their chances, the Bears have their fair share of match winners including Jonathan Trott, who despite his reputation for slow batting and limited involvement in this year’s competition used to be regarded as a Twenty20 specialist. Woakes added: 'If he plays then we know he can and will do the business. He is excellent in and around the camp and he gives the other guys in the side confidence - and most importantly he just keeps scoring runs for us. 'But let's not forget we also have Ian Bell who is a world-class operator, too. 'Then, with guys like (Varun) Chopra and (William) Porterfield opening the batting, or (Jeetan) Patel providing us with some crucial off-spin bowling, we have to be confident.'

"By . Sam Peters . Birmingham Bears v Surrey (11am) Hampshire v Lancashire Lightning (2.30pm) Finalist 1 v Finalist 2 (6.45pm) Jason Roy was one of Tom Maynard’s best friends so it was perhaps not surprising he went to a ‘weird’ place last season following the tragic death of one of English cricket’s brightest lights. Maynard’s passing, aged 23, on a south London railway line in 2012 shocked the cricketing world and devastated a Surrey squad that is only now starting to come to terms with his tragic loss. Roy’s form deserted him, averaging just eight in the County Championship while also struggling in shorter formats, but this season he has been transformed and now stands on the brink of an England place. Growing up: Surrey opener Graham Roy (pictured) believes Tom Maynard's death affected him . Tragic: Former Surrey cricketer Tom Maynard was found dead on a south London railway track in 2012 . Strange: Roy says 2013 was 'weird' because the Surrey squad was deeply affected by Maynard's death . LANCASHIRE LIGHTNING . Former England all-rounder Andrew Flintoff has been named in Lancashire’s squad for finals day despite spending the last three weeks in a fish and chip van filming a documentary for Sky about the nation’s favourite dish. Jimmy Anderson and Jos Buttler are also included in Lancashire’s squad. It is understood Flintoff - who came out of retirement to play two T20 games earlier this season - is unlikely to play, but his inclusion raises the intriguing possibility of him bowling to his 2005 Ashes winning team-mate Kevin Pietersen if Lancashire and Surrey reach the final. HAMPSHIRE . Hampshire captain James Vince is highly regarded by England’s hierarchy and the young batsman has a chance to rubber-stamp his inclusion in the Three Lions T20 squad with a strong showing on Saturday. Hampshire, beaten finalists last year, are playing in their fifth consecutive finals day. They take on Lancashire in the second semi-final at 2.30pm. BIRMINGHAM BEARS . England batsman Ian Bell has a chance to showcase his T20 credentials as part of the Warwickshire squad that face Surrey in the first semi-final. The England star is under pressure for his one-day international place with uncapped Alex Hales breathing down his neck after some fine displays for Nottinghamshire. A strong showing on Saturday could help Bell’s case. ‘Tom’s death had a huge effect on myself and all the mates around him and the club and his family,’ Roy said ahead of Saturday’s Twenty20 Finals Day. ‘It was a hugely tragic situation. I think we have moved forward very well this year since then. I’m very impressed with how everyone has come out and done this season. ‘Last year I was just in a weird place with cricket. I didn’t feel like I was getting anywhere with my game. I was concentrating on too many exterior factors other than watching the ball. ‘I’m in a much better place this season. Things outside cricket can affect how you play sometimes and it’s just about finding a way of eradicating those negative things. ‘The last two years I have matured a huge amount. Obviously a few things I have been through off the field have made that possible.’ Talented: Maynard's death affected the Surrey squad and forced them all to 'mature', says Roy . On the brink: Roy's outstanding opening for Surrey this season has led to calls for him to play for England . Saturday’s appearance at Edgbaston against Warwickshire in the last four of the Natwest T20 Blast will provide Roy with another opportunity to demonstrate his England credentials. If Surrey defend their title, they will owe a significant debt to Roy after a season that has seen him elevate himself to the brink of international recognition. Earlier this month he hit five sixes in six balls for England Lions against Sri Lanka and he has been instrumental in powering Surrey into the T20 semi-finals with some outstanding hitting at the top of the order. It says a lot about how much the South-African born star has improved this season that he remains frustrated he was not able to join an elite club of batsmen to have hit six maximums in an over. ‘Not much has changed technique-wise this season, but mentally I have been a lot more relaxed, taking each game as it comes,’ the 24-year-old said. ‘If I do well I stay level and if I do badly I try and stay on the same level. Not having too many ups and downs has been a massive factor. Praise: Roy says that Surrey's coaching team of Graham Ford and Alec Stewart have been 'good' for him . ‘Last season, being younger and a bit more immature I would get upset and angry. I knew in my mind what I wanted to achieve but I wasn’t achieving it and that’s probably the most frustrating thing for anyone. So this time around I’m just staying relaxed.’ Surrey’s new coaching regime of South African Graham Ford and club legend Alec Stewart - replacing Chris Adams - has clearly had a calming effect on a squad of players taken to the brink by their friend’s premature passing. ‘Graham Ford has been very good for me,’ Roy said. ‘He’s very basic, which is exactly what I was looking for. He’s basic and to the point and I know as long as I keep my basics right then I’m strong and in a good place.’ Unlucky to miss out on a place in England’s one-day squad to face India, Roy can expect a call up for the solitary Twenty20 international at Edgbaston on September 7. ‘If I can keep scoring runs I think anything’s possible to be honest,’ he said. ‘I feel like I can handle myself at all levels so fingers crossed I get the opportunity to do so and score runs.’ Coaching team: Alec Stewart (pictured) and Graham Ford have led Surrey to a second straight finals day .

"By . Chris Waugh . Chris Woakes is targeting an extended stay in the England Test side following his successful return to the the fold this summer. The 25-year-old bowling all-rounder played the final three Tests against India, helping England to win all three and clinch a 3-1 series victory despite having trailed 1-0 after two matches. Four wickets in the final match at The Oval seemed to justify his selection following two quiet Tests, and Woakes believes he is finally settling into the international fold. The Mighty Woakes: Chris Woakes celebrates taking a wicket at The Oval . Woakes said: 'I had a taste of Test cricket last summer against Australia and it helped me to improve as a player. 'I did OK last year but I think I have improved as a cricketer in the mean time and come back stronger. 'I have added more pace in my bowling and I think my game has moved up a level to when I first broke into the England team.' The right-arm fast-medium bowler is highly-regarded within the England set-up, yet he faces stiff competition for places in an ever-evolving line-up. Ben Stokes, Chris Jordan, Liam Plunkett and the once-again selectable Steven Finn are just some of the players vying for a spot in the Test side. And, with England not playing another Test until they tour the West Indies in March, Woakes may have a little time to wait yet to fully cement his place in the side. 'It is a fresh squad in many ways and I am happy to be a part of it. It's all a blur: Woakes (centre) has put on a yard of pace since his Test debut last year . Appealing trait: Woakes implores the umpire to give Murali Vijay (left) out - which he does . Well done: Woakes is congratulated by England captain Alastair Cook after victory at The Oval . 'We haven't got a Test for a while now which is a little frustrating but I aim to be involved once they do come back round again. 'Playing for England is what we all aim for as county cricketers. Having been in and out of the squad for few years now it was nice to get a run in the Test team towards the end of the summer. Delighted: Woakes after the Oval win . 'I got myself one or two important wickets - and a few runs here and there - and so I feel pretty good about how I contributed to the side. 'We played some really good cricket as a team and, when you win a Test series, it is a great feeling. Playing Test cricket for England is the pinnacle. I am just delighted I am able to say I was a part of such a fantastic victory in the series against India.' The Warwickshire bowler - who will feature for the county under their limited-overs name the Birmingham Bears at the NatWest Twenty20 finals day at Edgbaston on Saturday - first appeared on the international scene in the shorter form of the game in January 2011. And, with 13 ODIs and five international Twenty20s behind him, Woakes is keen to be involved in the one-day side of things over the coming months ahead of the World Cup in Australia and New Zealand next year. 'It's nice to be included in the squad for the India ODI series, especially with so much one-day cricket coming up in the next year. 'It's a huge achievement to be involved in any international squad so I am very pleased. 'Obviously I hope to be going to the World Cup in 2015, so there's that little added incentive too.'

"By . Bianca London . and Lucy Waterlow . Many pregnant women do like to keep up with a gentle exercise routine while expecting, but it's doubtful that many would fancy doing an 800m running race. However, a five-time U.S. national champion did just that and ran it in just over two minutes - all while she was 34-weeks pregnant. Olympian Alysia Montano may have finished last in the race yesterday at the Hornet Stadium in Sacramento, California, but she said she enjoyed it and felt 'really good'. Scroll down for video . Look at her go! Alysia Montano, left, who is 34 weeks pregnant, competes in an 800m race in Sacramento, California . The 28-year-old runner, who received a . standing ovation after completing the race in 2 minutes, 32.13 seconds, . said: 'I've been running throughout my pregnancy and I felt really, . really good during the whole process.' Her finishing time was 35 seconds slower than her personal best of 1:57.34, which she smashed back in 2010 in a race in Monaco, but is still a time many recreational runners wouldn't be able to achieve. Nicknamed the 'flying flower' thanks to always racing with one in her hair, she joked her biggest fear was being lapped in USATF Outdoor Championships race. 'I just didn't want to get lapped and be the first person to get lapped in the 800,' said Montano. Feeling fine: Olympian Alysia Montano finished last in the race but still ran at a pace many would struggle to achieve . She has grown up training and competing so didn't want to stop while pregnant- and her doctors said there was no reason why she couldn't carry on . The 28-year-old is expecting her first baby with her husband Louis, who she married in 2011. Doctors gave Montano the OK to take part in the race and she hopes it dispels misconceptions over exercise and pregnancy. 'That took away any fear of what the outside world might think about a woman running during her pregnancy,' Montano said of getting her doctor's approval. Montano has been training and competing since she was a child and was glad to find there was no reason why she shouldn't continue while expecting. 'What I found out mostly was that exercising during pregnancy is actually much better for the mom and the baby...I did all the things I normally do...I just happened to be pregnant. This is my normal this year,' she said. She knew she had no chance of winning or running at her best during the race but emphasises that wasn't the point. She wanted to take part for the joy of racing. She writes on her blog that she thinks it's important that people - whatever their ability - remember that it's the taking part in sport that counts. 'Racing is still very enjoyable for me because I've been able to think of it like a kid does. They're so innocent - they're wanting to win but they're having fun, too,' she writes. 'As you get older, it's easy to put importance on things that really don't matter and then succumb to that pressure; so I don't like to get myself wrapped up by talking about competitive goals too much.' Good effort: Montano, a four-time national . champion in the 800, came in last in her heat with a time a 2 minutes, . 32.3 seconds and received a standing ovation . Doctor's orders: Her doctors encouraged her to participate, which, she says, took away any fear of what the outside world might think about a woman running during her pregnancy . Seasoned athlete: Montano competing before her pregnancy. She was 5th in the London 2012 Olympics, right . Flying flower: Her pace in the race while pregnant was a lot slower than she usually goes around the track when racing . Experts . say it's safe for women who are used to keeping fit like Montano to . carry on exercising while pregnant - albeit at a lower intensity than . before. The . pace Montano ran at in the race while pregnant would certainly be a . more leisurely one for her than usual - in the 2012 Olympic Games in . London, she came 5th with a time under two minutes. It seems likely she will get back into training when it's safe to do so after having her baby and she has admitted one of her dreams is to one day open a personal fitness studio for working parents - where they can bring their children along to keep fit too. Run for fun: She's used to winning races but said it's the taking part that counts . Fitness advocate: Montano would one day like to open a fitness centre for families . She said: 'I want to teach people about exercise and fitness and how it can be really fun, and I want to help parents educate their children about it, because that's where everything starts.' She's certainly not the first to pull on her jogging shoes while pregnant and she won't be the last. Nell McAndrew famously came under fire when she . revealed in 2012 that at 20 weeks pregnant with her second child, she was still running . six miles a day. Like Olympic athletes including Paula Radcliffe and Jo Pavey, . who ran moderately throughout their . pregnancies and went on to have healthy babies, Nell decreased the . intensity as well as length of her runs to alleviate any risk to herself and her unborn child. Before she conceived, she had been running 90 miles a week while training for the London Marathon so six miles a day was a significant reduction in mileage. Yet despite Nell taking all the precautions recommended by medical professionals, . she has still faced outrage from people who have accused her of putting her baby at risk through exercise. Keeping fit: Nell McAndrew was still running six . miles a day while pregnant with her second child, but this is a big step . down from the mileage she did when training to run sub three hours at . the London Marathon in 2012, right . She . told the MailOnline at the time: 'When I tell people I'm still exercising, they . react as if I've told them I've been smoking or drinking alcohol while . pregnant. But what I'm doing is actually good for me and my baby.' Nell said she felt good being active and that by being fit, she felt better prepared for child birth. 'I feel like keeping fit is preparing me for the labour - which will be harder than running a marathon!' she said. Nell's belief that fitness aids labour is is . backed up by studies that have found that babies . of women who exercise are better off when it comes to their birth because . 'fetuses of exercising women may tolerate labour better than those of non-exercisers,' according to The Royal College of . Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (RCOG). Famous example: Paula Radcliffe reduced her . training but carried on running when she was pregnant, as pictured here . when taking part in a fun run with her daughter Isla while carrying her . son . Along with official NHS guidelines that recommend 30 minutes of moderate . exercise a day for expectant mothers, the RCOG also advocate exercise where there are no complications in the pregnancy and . precautions are taken such as not exercising at a high intensity to raise the heart rate to its maximum and not running . while it's too hot due to a risk of overheating. They state: 'In most cases, exercise is safe for both mother and fetus during . pregnancy and women should therefore be encouraged to initiate or continue . exercise to derive the health benefits . associated with such activities.' They add that it's a fallacy that exercise increases the risk of miscarriage or . damage to an unborn baby stating 'women should be advised that adverse pregnancy or neonatal outcomes are not increased . for exercising women.' Fears that a baby will be shaken and distressed in the womb are misguided as a baby is well-insulated by fluid to protect it. RCOG explain that exercising while pregnant has numerous benefits for the . mother's health and wellbeing. 'Maternal . benefits appear to be both physical and psychological in nature. Many . common complaints of pregnancy, including fatigue, varicosities . and swelling of extremities, are reduced in women who exercise. Additionally, active women experience less insomnia, . stress, anxiety and depression,' they state. Women who exercise while pregnant will also gain less excess weight, lowering . the health risks associated with obesity. Speaking about whether it's safe to . run while pregnant, maternal health expert Sheeva Talebian, M.D., told . Women's Running: 'Running is safe anytime - during the first, second and . third trimester - if you are having an uncomplicated pregnancy. 'You should not run if you have . complications like elevated blood pressure or, in some cases, multiple . gestation, that would cause an obstetrician to advise no high-impact . exercise. 'Just because you're pregnant doesn’t . mean you can’t stay in shape. All of the same reasons you normally . exercise - heart health, stress reduction, weight maintenance, lower . blood pressure - are reasons to run during pregnancy. 'Additionally, women who exercise . while pregnant have lower rates of diabetes and preeclampsia, and they . are less likely to gain an unhealthy (and potentially dangerous) amount . of weight. There's even some data that suggests babies born to women who . worked out while expecting have stronger cardiovascular systems.'","Alysia Montano took part in the London Olympics representing the U.S.

"By . Ruth Styles . From muscled rugby players to stylish tennis hunks, the world of sport isn't short of a handsome chap or two. Now the UK's rowing talent has stepped up to the plate to prove that football and tennis players aren't the only ones who know what they're doing when it comes to looking good. Resplendent in jaunty pink and green stripes, natty scarlet and elegant navy, these striking shots show that Britain's boaters are both stylish and handsome. Handsome chap: The University of Cambridge Boat Club's Geoff Roth models the university's light blue blazer . Handsome chaps: The University of London rowing club photographed in their distinctive aubergine blazers . Shot by former Ralph Lauren Rugby director of concept, F.E. Castleberry, the photos were taken to illustrate a quirky new fashion tome, Rowing Blazers. The work of professional rower Jack Carlson, Rowing Blazers takes a closer look at the traditional jackets worn by boating club members - and features some of the hunkiest stars around. Among them is Andy Triggs Hodge MBE, a double Olympic gold medallist and three-time world champion, and Alex Gregory MBE, who also took an Olympic gold for Team GB. Blazers to feature in the book, each of which have different colours depending on the club, include that of the Eton rowing team, Cambridge University and the London Rowing Club.

Stylish: Eton rowing captain Constantine Louloudis (left) and Andy Triggs Hodge MBE in Molesey colours . One of the most popular wardrobe additions on the planet, blazers began life in 1825 with the scarlet jackets worn by rowers from the Lady Margaret Boat Club at St. John's College, Cambridge. Later, the blazer was adopted by the Royal Navy, with the crew of HMS Blazer dressing their captain in a blue-and-white striped version of the jacket. Striped jackets also proved popular with the mods in the 1960s, with mod icons such as The Who, the Rolling Stones and the Moody Blues regularly sporting variations. Women, however, barely got a look in until 2006 when blazers exploded off the catwalk and into wardrobes, swiftly becoming a staple piece. But as these photos prove, few do a natty blazer better than Britain's rowers. Rowing Blazers by Jack Carlson, £35, is published by Thames and Hudson on 7th July .

"By . Bianca London . A super slimmer who lost a staggering 12 stone in weight is hoping to raise £30,000 through crowdfunding - to remove her two stone of saggy excess skin. Shirley Hoffman, 30, was dubbed the 'big bloated whale' by cruel children when she was growing up and her weight continued to spiral through adulthood on a 6,000-calorie-a-day diet. The mother-of-three eventually peaked at more than 24 stone - the same weight as a baby killer whale. It was at this point doctors told Shirley, from Lakenheath, Suffolk, she was morbidly obese, forcing her into action. Help me! Shirley Hoffman, who has lost 12st, has turned to crowdfunding to raise the money to remove her saggy skin - she hopes to raise £30,000 . Shirley, married to husband Joseph, decided to have her stomach stapled and she managed to lose 12 stone - halving her bodyweight. But she was left with two stone of saggy skin and now wants a tummy tuck as well as a thigh, bum, boob and arm lift. Shirley has launched a GoFundMe crowdfunding project to raise £30,000 to pay for the medical procedures - but has only raised £200 so far. She said: 'I hate my skin, it is horrible and embarrassing. I worked so hard to escape my 24-stone prison only to be stuck in another body I can't stand. At her heaviest: Shirley, pictured weighing 24 stone, was told by doctors she was morbidly obese . Taunts: Shirley lived on 6,000 calories a day and peaked at 24 stone. She decided to lose weight, and now she wants to lose her saggy skin . 'My skin gets in the way of everything, I can't be intimate with my husband or exercise because there is too much skin. 'I even have to wear a full body suit to keep the excess skin in place under my clothes. I have more health problems now with my skin ripping and infections than I did when I was 24 stone.' Before Shirley could undergo a gastric bypass, she had to lose two stone for the operation to be performed safely. In an attempt to ditch the pounds, the mother swapped her sugary breakfast cereal and fried lunches for protein shakes, then wholemeal pasta with turkey for dinner. Inconvenient: Shirley says that her skin gets in the way of everything and she can't be intimate with her husband or exercise because there is too much skin . Seeking help: Shirley has now turned to the goodwill of others and set up a GoFundMe page appealing for people to fund her cosmetic surgery . Former self: Shirley, pictured at 24 stone, began walking, and in five months she had managed to drop two stone for the gastric bypass operation, which would shrink her stomach to the size of an egg . She also began walking, and in five months she had managed to drop two stone for the gastric bypass operation, which would shrink her stomach to the size of an egg. She said: 'I was in lots of pain after the operation and could only take in an ounce of water every hour. My stomach was tiny so I couldn't risk tearing it. 'Instead of eating my usual 6,000 calories a day, I was restricted to just 500 calories. It was tough at first, I really missed the greasy foods but as the weight fell away I became more motivated to continue.' Shirley has now turned to the goodwill of others and set up a GoFundMe page appealing for people to fund her cosmetic surgery. Feeling low: She said: 'On bad days, I wonder if I would have been better just staying at 24 stone, as I seem to have more health problems now at half that weight' As she was: Before Shirley could undergo a gastric bypass, she had to lose two stone for the operation to be performed safely . The mother-of-three has raised £200 for the procedures so far - a way off the £30,000 it will cost. She added: 'I hate the bodysuit I have to wear. The suit sits under my breasts holding in my stomach, back and thighs. I only take it off when I sleep and shower. 'I can't face looking at myself naked and only get intimate with Joseph with the lights out. I'm desperate to have surgery to remove the skin, so I'm saving every penny but I can't afford to fund it all myself. It's too expensive. 'On bad days, I wonder if I would have been better just staying at 24 stone, as I seem to have more health problems now at half that weight. 'Hopefully one day I'll get to enjoy my new body.'

"By . Sarah Dean . She was branded 'deluded' for eating a diet consisting of 20 bananas a day while pregnant but three months on from giving birth, Loni Jane Anthony says her baby is 'thriving'. The 26-year-old Instagram sensation has hit back at her critics, who said her extreme vegan lifestyle could damage her child's health. 'It is a really good feeling to prove to a lot of people that what I was doing was the right thing,' she told 9 Stories. Scroll down for video . 'Thriving': Loni Jane Anthony says her baby boy Rowdy is happy and healthy at three-months-old . Ms Anthony gave birth to baby boy Rowdy Nash, weighing 8lbs 7oz, on March 2. The first-time mother from Brisbane, Queensland, who was told her baby would be born 'sick' by some nutritionists, is now happy to reveal little Rowdy is 'a strong boy' who is 'meeting all these milestones'. 'I think for a lot of people they don't want to believe that something so simple actually works,' she said. Favourite fruit: Just like his mum, Rowdy also seems to be a fan of bananas. Loni Jane ate 20 bananas a day while pregnant . Fighting back: Loni is enjoying being a mum and says the 'negativity' about her lifestyle doesn't get to her . She added: 'The negativity doesn't get to me one bit because I know what I'm doing is right. I'm not silly and I'm not on a diet this is my lifestyle it's every single day.' Despite having her hands full with her newborn, Ms Anthony hasn't stopped updating her Instagram account with pictures of her favourite fruit juices and colourful vegan dishes. But Rowdy is now the star attraction of her Instagram page. The besotted mum often posts pictures of her adorable baby and even snapped him chewing on her favourite fruit - a bannana, this week. Growing: Loni posted this photo of Rowdy and Saturday, in which he reaches up to touch his mum . Newborn: Health fanatic Loni captioned this photo: 'What to do with an empty watermelon??? Ahhhh put Rowdy in it' The Australian social media identity who first came under fire six months into her pregnancy, when she claimed she would continue her plant-based diet throughout motherhood, says her diet has kept her in 'good shape'. After giving birth, the controversial 'creative artist' boasted she was 'living proof that you don’t have to become a whale when you’re pregnant'. 'You don’t have to put on heaps of weight and never bounce back — you can stay really healthy,' she told News.com.au. 'Play time': The besotted mum posts pictures of her adorable baby to keep her followers updated on his growth . Fruit obsessed: Loni is still enjoying her plant-based diet. She posted this picture of a 'spinach, frozen bananas, frozen mango and water' smoothie and her healthy breakfast this week . The new mother, who claims her favourite drink is a watermelon, beetroot and lemon juice, was quick to post pictures on Instagram of her taut stomach to prove just how pleased she is with her arguably risky decision. Ms Anthony revealed, on her Tumblr page, that she plans to raise her son as a vegan. But she conceded that as he gets older 'he can then make his own decisions with that'. When Ms Anthony first revealed her somewhat unusual diet to the world, via her blog Aleven:11, commentators deemed the pretty blonde 'irresponsible' and 'narcissistic' - especially as her Instagram account, which boasts almost 100,000 followers, features dozens of 'selfies' showcasing her slim figure. Back in November, Shona Wilkinson, Head Nutritionist at www.nutricentre.com, told Mail Online: 'This isn't a diet I would recommend to a pregnant woman. Protein and fats are important in our diet especially during pregnancy.' Proud mum: Loni Jane Anthony posted this picture of her flat stomach on Instagram while cuddling her new baby boy Rowdy Nash four weeks ago, just 12 days after giving birth . Loni Jane Anthony said that she put on 17kg (around 37lb) when pregnant but it was 'pretty much all baby and fluid' 'The amino acids that make up protein are the building blocks of your body's cells – and of your baby's body as well. It's important to get enough protein throughout your pregnancy, but especially during the second and third trimesters, when your baby is growing the fastest.' 'Some fats are particularly important during pregnancy because they support your baby's brain and eye development – both before and after birth. Fats also help the placenta and other tissues grow, and studies show that some fats may help prevent and low birth weight.' Ms Anthony first got into predominantly eating fruit after getting sick and tired of her 'party lifestyle' which saw her binge on junk food and alcohol. Camera shy? The Instagram star introduces her healthy baby boy to the world in one of many new family snaps . No fat allowed: Loni loves posting pictures of her plant-based meals on Instagram . 'It wasn’t for weight loss or for a quick fix. I was internally really sick; I was killing myself slowly. If I’d kept living that lifestyle I would have ended up with a disease like cancer or early aging. So giving up that food was really quite simple for me,' she said. Originally she adopted the low-fat vegan diet created by Dr Douglas M. Graham known as the 80/10/10, which is popular among athletes. It takes its name from its recommended dietary intake: 80 per cent fruits and vegetables, ten per cent protein and ten per cent fat. The party days are over: Loni snuggles up with baby Rowdy as she defends her controversial diet . Over the past three years Ms Anthony has adapted the plan to suit her tastes - despite many of her friends deeming her 'nuts' for gorging on so many bananas. On her blog she details a 'typical' day's menu. 'Breakfast usually consists of a mono meal of fruit (at least half a watermelon, six or more big oranges, grapes, apples, pineapple etc). 'Then either mid-morning or lunch depending on how I'm feeling and what I'm doing with usually be a one liter or more smoothie that will always consist of six or more bananas, water, dates and maybe green powder added or berries or coconut water/meat etc.' Dramatic results: Loni posted this picture five months ago, showing her stomach before she was pregnant in her 'good ol pair of blueys'","Loni Jane Anthony came under fire for her plant-based diet while pregnant .

"By . Spencer Matthews . The problem of living in New York City is that everyone wants to come out and visit you. Even my agent (London's answer to Entourage's Ari Gold) came up with a excuse to come over and he rarely travels anywhere outside the M25. So when you are trying to lead a quiet and clean-living life, there are constant temptations from random colleagues and friends coming over and you feel obliged to entertain them. They have just travelled 3,500 miles for heaven's sake. Last week my ex-city colleague Max KW came over, and my friend and EDM singer Stacey Jackson was on her way back to the UK to play at Gay Pride, so we had a goodbye celebration at the Up and Down Club. We went along with Binky Felstead and Rosie Fortescue. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . New York life: Jamie Laing, Oliver Proudlock, Stevie Johnson and Spencer attend their first Darty in NYC . The party must have been good, the day later someone told me the downstairs room is the best part of the venue. I wasn't even aware there was a downstairs although perhaps I should have worked it out from the name. Later in the week Oliver Proudlock took us to a Darty in Brooklyn. A Darty is a Day Party at a club – we didn't make this up, it's a New York thing. It was at this amazingly cool club called Output in Brooklyn on a Saturday. Blazing sunshine, good tunes and great times. Proudlock later broke from the group and met up with the Gillingham FC cheerleaders. I think the decent thing would have been to check in on Facebook and wait for us to locate him and the @GFCGems. But he didn't. Rosie Fortescue, Stacey Jackson and Binky Felstead enjoy the New York City nightlife . New York City is famous for its rooftop parties as Spencer found out . Jamie Laing and I are still trying to do us best to fight the inevitable decline of our bodies against this onslaught and he has taken to using MyCloudTag fitness app. It's the latest American app designed by top international fitness experts, an Antartica exploration team and the developers of Xbox Kinect. The blurb on iTunes says, 'fun and effective workouts'. Jamie didn't look like he was having much fun, he looked pretty ruined afterwards but I suppose that's the point. I've been joining him without the aid of an electronic fitness instructor but with the added boost from a couple of Forza T5 Super Strength supplements. To be fair the fat burner routines on the app are pretty good, and so we just about maintaining our physiques. Mr Popular: Proudlock and Stevie make new friends at the Output Darty . Proudlock was eager to break away from the group and spend time with the Gillingham Cheerleaders . I am becoming slightly homesick now for one big reason. The British Grand Prix.

My old pal Jonny Dodge is running the event and last weekend he had the Lotus F1 Team racing one of their cars around Canary Wharf just for shits and giggles. He works out: Jamie looks tired after his MyCloud Tag exercise regime . Wish I'd been there, I'd have given anything for a go in that car – it was the old 2013 V8 F1 car – loud as hell and very fast. They . were trying to raise awareness in a London road race like Monaco, and . that would be something amazing. You can see it on the video here. That's one thing that could never happen in NYC – there are no bends in the roads in Manhattan. Lots of Love, Spencer.

"By . Katy Winter . A mother who was told she was too fat to conceive naturally has spoken of her joy after she lost five stone - and gave birth to a healthy baby girl. Kerry McKenna, 33, endured two years of heartache after unsuccessfully trying for a child with husband Mike, 34, since 2011. Doctors warned Kerry, from Derbyshire, she was too overweight to give birth naturally as she tipped the scales at 16 stone 11lb and wore size 20 clothes. New look: Kerry dropped from 16 stone 11lb (left) to 11st 11lb (right) in order to be able to conceive . Dream family: Kerry holding baby Abigail, who was born on February 2 . Kerry, pictured before her weight loss with husband Mike, blamed her figure on eating convenience food all day . But determined Kerry decided to lose weight and shed five stone by eating more healthily - and was delighted when she fell pregnant in April last year. On February 2, Kerry gave birth to their first child, Abigail, who weighed 7lbs 10oz, at Nottingham’s Queen’s Medical Centre. And, since giving birth, the new mum has already lost most of her baby weight and is a healthy 11 stone 11lb and a size 10. Kerry, who lives in Long Eaton with football commentator husband Mike, said she ditched frozen pizzas and pies to lose weight, adding: 'I really wanted to start a family. 'We’d tried for a year and nothing was happening so the doctor said ""the first thing you need to do is try and lose some weight"". Before she lost weight, pictured with Mike, Kerry was warned by doctors she was too overweight to conceive . 'You don’t want to be a big person so there’s always something in your mind saying you really should lose weight. 'But when the doctor said my chances of pregnancy were increased if I lost weight, that gave me the motivation to stop putting it off. 'There wasn’t even any inkling of the possibility of falling pregnant until I’d lost the weight. 'Abigail is perfect. I feel really blessed that we have her, our dream to have a family has come true.' Kerry blamed her bulging figure on eating convenience food all day while working for Boots on their website at the company’s headquarters in Beeston, Nottinghamshire. Having joined Slimming World and slimmed to a size 10 (L) Kerry and Mike were delighted to find out she was pregnant with their first child (R) after trying to conceive for years . A scan of Abigail, the couples longed-for daughter in the womb. Baby Abigail weighed 7lbs 10oz when she was born at Nottingham's Queen's Medical Centre . But the pounds soon fell off after she joined Slimming World - and it also educated Kerry to get the right nutrients on board once she was pregnant. The IT worker added: 'It was frozen pizzas or pies or just the stuff you could throw in the oven at the end of the day. 'Lunch was a sandwich and crisps. I had Diet Coke, thinking that made it a bit healthy, but I was just kidding myself. 'I was a bit lazy in what I was eating. It was always about something quick and convenient. 'Joining Slimming World opened my eyes to being able to eat proper food. Breakfast: Sugary cereals like Frosties . Mid-morning: Chocolate bar or crisps . Lunch: Shop-bought sandwich, like Ploughman’s or cheese, and crisps . Afternoon: Biscuits . Dinner: Frozen pizza and chips . Evening: Biscuits . Breakfast: Weetabix . Mid-morning: Yoghurt . Lunch: Pasta with salad . Afternoon: Fruit . Dinner: Homemade chilli with rice and roasted vegetables . Evening: Nothing . 'I thought it was going to be a diet but I realised quite quickly it’s about eating proper, balanced food. 'It was more about focusing on making sure I was eating the right foods and you get an extra allowance of calcium and fibre to make sure you’re giving the baby everything it needs. 'Fruit gave me terrible indigestion so trying to get the healthy balance in was a little tricky at times but I relied on vegetables instead of fruit to make sure I got all the vitamins. 'The wonderful thing was I looked pregnant. 'I was scared that I was going to end up looking like a fat woman again and people wouldn’t realise I was pregnant but it all went on the front and for once I felt like I actually looked good.' Members of Kerry’s Slimming World class in Chilwell, Nottinghamshire, have since met baby Abigail. Group leader Kerry Ward said: 'To see Kerry lose the weight and have Abigail is lovely. She’s the most beautiful baby. 'Kerry has done amazingly well and has been so dedicated. She only missed two weigh-ins before the birth and one the week afterwards. 'We don’t encourage pregnant women to lose weight but to eat healthily and keep active.'","Kerry dropped from 16st 11lb to 11st 11lb in order to be able to conceive .

"By . Annabel Fenwick Elliott . Some who possess them can't stand them, and now that freckles are back in vogue, many who don't have them are drawing them on instead. After a fair smattering of freckles appeared on the faces of models at this year's spring runways, they officially became a trend; popular for lending a natural, youthful, sun-kissed look to the skin. Two weeks ago, singer Demi Lovato posted a make-up free selfie to Instagram captioned 'Freckles,' and this month, Topshop will launch the DIY Freckle Pencil, so that anyone can dot them on. Dotty: Love them or hate them, freckles have come back around in style, credited with creating a youthful, sun-kissed appearance to the skin . Freckles, much like bushy eyebrows - thanks to Cara Delevingne - and cheek dimples - we're looking at you Kate Middleton - have a habit of going in and out of style; swinging between dorkish and highly desirable. DIY freckle pencils have been around for some time, from brands including Lancôme and Chanel, and Topshop's latest offering - which goes on sale this month for $13 - boasts a 3D 'marbleized formula' to better mimic natural freckles. Celebrity make-up artist Kate Best, who has worked with stars including Lucy Liu, Lindsay Lohan, Vanessa Williams and Rebecca Romijn, shared her tips for achieving the look at home with MailOnline. 'Whatever you do, don't forget about . your 'freckles' and rub your face, or your look will swiftly go from . on-trend to needs-a-bath' 'Using a soft eyebrow pencil a few shades lighter than your brows, apply the dots to either side of the nose, and across the bridge, going no further than the apples of the cheeks,' she suggests, adding that the tip of the pencil should be dull, so as to achieve imprecise dots which look more realistic. 'Lightly press the dots with the tip of your finger to smudge them ever-so-slightly,' she says. 'Then apply a dust of powder to set your work, topped with a touch of blush. 'Remember; less is more, keep the lips natural so they don't fight for attention, and whatever you do, don't forget about your 'freckles' and rub your face, or your look will swiftly go from on-trend to needs-a-bath.' Summer trend: Singer Demi Lovato showcased her fresh-faced, freckle-sprinkled nose and cheeks (left) in an Instagram snap last month, and Topshop are about to launch the Freckle Pencil, for DIY jobs (right) Natural freckles are in fact small dots of melanin, the pigment that causes our skin to darken in the sun. They are entirely natural, genetically pre-destined, and not harmful, unless confused with potentially cancerous melanomas, which sometimes look similar. Most commonly occurring on the face, freckles rarely appear on infants and usually start to develop in childhood or pre-pubescence, often fading as we grow older - thus the reason they evoke youth. They are more visible on fairer skin, and are noticeably enhanced by sunlight exposure. Faded: Actress Lindsay Lohan sported countless freckles as a child (left) but many have since vanished (right), and it is rumored that the star is soon planning to have them 'bleached or lasered off' completely . Lindsay Lohan is well-known for her freckle-covered face and body, although they seem to have diminished considerably over time. Earlier this month, RadarOnline reported that she is actually planning to have them removed. A source said: 'She’s always loved her freckles – well, pretended to, anyway – but now she’s decided it’s time to get rid of them and she’s looking into having them either bleached or lasered away.' There are a handful of freckle-speckled stars, on the other hand, who are more embracing of their natural skin. Subtle: Actresses Emma Stone (left) and Rashida Jones (right) both have a sprinkling of freckles dusting their noses, although they are seldom visible under heavy make-up . Embracing their skin: Lucy Liu (left) says she thinks her freckles give her 'a personality,' while Olivia Munn (right) dislikes it when make-up artists try to cover hers up . Actress Olivia Munn said to People last year: 'I've had them since I can remember... It's just my skin. I don't like it when people try to cover them up.' And Charlie's Angels star Lucy Liu once said to The New York Times: 'Freckles give you a personality without you ever having to say a word. People automatically think you're fun and have a very open nature, which is a great way to be perceived.' But whether or not you are naturally gifted with these little flecks of melanin, you can always try them on for size, at least for one summer.",Celebrity make-up artist Kate Best shares her tips on how to apply natural looking faux freckles .
"By . Ian Laybourn, Press Association . Former Bradford and Wakefield half-back Ben Jeffries has pulled out of a move to Championship leaders Leigh for injury and family reasons. The 33-year-old, who returned to Australia at the end of the 2012 season to work in the mines and play part-time rugby, was due to join the Centurions on a two-year deal from December. Leigh head of rugby Derek Beaumont said: 'It is very honest of Ben to contact us and notify us of his recent significant injury with a torn bicep.

"By . Deni Kirkova . A mother-of-four who ballooned to 22st has dropped six dress sizes and almost ten stone to set a healthy example as a nurse. Louise Daniel, 36, from Hornchurch, Essex, was delighted when she landed a university place to study nursing after raising her family. But then she realised she would have been unable to lecture patients about weight when she was embarrassed about her own unhealthy size. Louise weighed 22 stone and wore size 28 before her weight loss, she now wears size 16 and weights 13st 6lb . Louise had struggled to squeeze into a size 28 after years finishing off her children's food because she hated waste. She made her big decision to slim in April last year when she was accepted by the nursing course - and since has shed 7st and dropped to a healthy size 16. She now weighs 13st 6lb and will start her degree course at Essex University in September. The mother to James, 18, Liam, 12, Grace, nine, and Thomas, seven, now hopes to get down to 10 stone. Proud Louise said: 'I had my kids and I went from a size 14 to a size 24. It was a combination of my pregnancies and a bad diet. 'I put on a lot of weight and I was probably eating for two for a long time after I gave birth. 'I tried to lose it after I had all the kids but I just wasn't in the right frame of mind. She made habit of eating unhealthily, snacking and polishing off her children's leftovers . 'I had gone from working on my feet everyday to being at home as a mum and that was my whole life. 'I used to eat the kids' leftovers because I never wanted it to go to waste - that's what mums do. 'I got accepted onto the nursing course then I looked at myself and I thought ""I'm going to be doing 12 hour shifts"". I didn't think I would be able to manage it. 'How could I turn around at nearly 21 stone and tell patients they have to live a normal life. 'I think it would have been embarrassing for me to stand there and lecture them.' Louise said she was spurred to sign up to the nursing course after the sudden death of her father Brian Low, 67. She did a foundation course at her local college before being accepted onto a three-year nursing degree that she will start in September. Louise is pictured (L-R) losing almost ten stone, going from 22 to 13 stone 6 lbs . Breakfast - two slices of white toast with jam or marmalade . Snack - Chocolate digestives . Lunch - Peanut butter and chocolate spread sandwich on white bread with a Snickers bar and a milkshake . Snack - Large bag of cheese balls and biscuits . Dinner - Huge plate of spaghetti bolognese with value mince and lots of cheese . After dinner - Crisps or chocolate bar with full fat hot chocolate . Drinks - sugary drinks like coke . Breakfast - Porridge . Morning snack - Piece of fruit (usually grapes or a banana) Lunch . - Ham or tuna or egg salad with a small portion of new potatoes and . low fat dressing with a light bag of Quavers and some sugar-free . jelly . Snack - Fruit (usually grapes or a banana) Dinner - Small portion spaghetti bolognese with extra-lean mince and no cheese . After dinner - Diet hot chocolate with water . Drinks - flavoured water . She slimmed down with the help of her local Weight Watchers class, ditching crisps, biscuits and large meal portions for low-calorie food such as chicken breast and veg. Louise has even taken up jogging and goes once a week for 40 minutes - when a year ago walking down the stairs left her short of breath. She wants to be a trauma nurse, which she knew she couldn't handle at her previous weight. Louise said: 'I have always wanted to be a nurse, ever since I was a child. 'I got into hairdressing when I was young and I was doing that until I got pregnant. 'Now I feel so much more confident, I'm so much happier. Physically I feel one hundred times better.'

"By . Phil Casey, Press Association . Scotland's Marc Warren produced a nerveless final round to win his first European Tour title for seven years at the inaugural Made in Denmark event on Sunday. Warren began the day tied for the lead with Wales' Bradley Dredge, but carded a closing 68 in front of massive crowds at Himmerland Golf Resort to finish nine under par. The 33-year-old from Glasgow finished two shots clear of Dredge, with England's Phillip Archer three shots further back in third and home favourite Thomas Bjorn joint fourth with English pair Oliver Fisher and Eddie Pepperell. Title: Mark Warren is closing in on his third European Tour title at the Made in Denamrk event . Warren, who had suffered a number of near misses since the second of his Tour wins in 2007, made the ideal start with birdies on the third and fourth and then hit his approach to within inches of the hole on the eighth. That seemed certain to give him a five-shot lead, only for playing partner Dredge to hole from 18 feet after three bogeys and one birdie in the previous seven holes. Warren then dropped his first shot of the day after a wayward approach to the ninth and the gap was down to two when Dredge, whose last Tour win came in Switzerland in 2006, birdied the 11th. Warren responded immediately with a birdie from six feet on the 12th, aided by seeing Dredge narrowly miss on the same line from further away, but Dredge was refusing to throw in towel. Premier: Made in Denmark is in its inaugural year on the European Tour . Victory: The 33-year-old Scottish golfer had not won a European Tour title since 2007 . The 41-year-old reduced the gap again with a birdie from four feet on the 13th and looked in prime position to get closer still on the next. However, Warren holed from 50 feet across the green for an unlikely birdie - and looked somewhat embarrassed as the ball just toppled in the left side of the hole - and Dredge did well to hole from 10 feet to remain two behind. Warren missed from just six feet for birdie on the par-three 16th, but then saw Dredge miss his par putt from even closer after recovering from a greenside bunker. Dredge hit back with a birdie on the 17th to get within two shots once again, but found an awkward lie on the edge of a fairway bunker and was unable to apply any more pressure as Warren held on for the win.","Marc Warren produced composed final round to win first European Tour title in seven years at inaugural Made in Denmark event .

"By . Ian Ladybourn, Press Association . Warrington took full advantage of Castleford's decision to field a weakened team to strengthen their bid for a top-two finish in the First Utility Super League. Tigers coach Daryl Powell rested six members of his likely Challenge Cup final team and, although his makeshift line-up were far from disgraced, they could not match their opponents' superior finishing as they succumbed to a 48-10 defeat. The Wolves needed to win by 29 points to leapfrog Castleford into fourth place and they reached their target courtesy of Joel Monaghan's 24th Super League try of the season seven minutes from the end. With one eye on Wembley, Powell made nine changes to the side that won the semi-final against Widnes, giving a first start to full-back Ben Reynolds and debuts to young forwards Brad Day and Will Maher off the bench. Warrington coach Tony Smith left out only scrum-half Richie Myler and prop Roy Asotasi from the team that performed so disappointingly against Leeds in the semi-final and they went some way to making amends. Castleford actually dominated the opening quarter, forcing three goal-line drop-outs and repeated sets, but without being able to supply the final touches to their promising build-up play. The Wolves' defence was up to the task and they struck twice on the counter-attack to open up a 12-0 lead. Moving upwards: Warrington took advantage of a weakened Castleford side on Friday night to win 48-10 . Left centre Ryan Atkins got the opening try, taking advantage of a kind bounce after Reynolds was deceived by a kick from Gareth O'Brien, who then supported a long-range break by Michael Monaghan to score the second. Right centre Chris Bridge crashed through some poor defence to score a third Warrington try on 22 minutes and kicked his third conversion before hobbling off with a leg injury. At 18-0, the visitors were in danger of being blown away but they stuck valiantly to their task and pulled a try back on 26 minutes when left winger James Clare took Jamie Ellis' long pass and produced a superb one-handed finish at the corner. Clare is likely to make way for the return of Australian winger Justin Carney for the cup final but is doing his best to present Powell with a selection dilemma. The Tigers almost scored again before half-time when second rower Frankie Mariano was put through a gap on halfway by Nathan Massey and held off the cover on a blazing sprint to the line, only to be held on his back in Rhys Evans' last-ditch tackle. However, there was no stopping Oliver Holmes six minutes into the second half when he took Ellis' short pass to barge his way over despite the efforts of four defenders. Liam Finn's conversion cut the deficit to eight points but Warrington made the game safe with two further tries in a five-minute spell. Evans took Simon Grix's cut-out pass to cross at the corner for the first of his two tries and prop Anthony England charged onto Mick Higham's short pass to crash over by the posts. Stefan Ratchford added both conversions in the absence of Bridge to make it 30-10 and then used an overlap to cross for his side's sixth try on 65 minutes. As the visitors tired, Monaghan and Evans both went over in the last seven minutes as Warrington emphasised their superiority and Ratchford took his goal tally to five from as many attempts.","Castleford coach Daryl Powell rests six players of likely Challenge Cup team .

"By . Hamish Mackay for MailOnline . Follow @@H_Mackay . Kevin Sutherland made history on the Champions Tour on Saturday by becoming the first person to card a sub-60 round, with a magical 59 seeing him storm to the top of the Dick's Sporting Goods Open leaderboard. Perhaps what is most remarkable about the 50-year-old's record is that he made a bogey on the final hole of his second round, with his tee on the 18th finding the rough costing him a chance of recording 14-under-par 58. He began the day at Endicott, New York by incredibly picking up shots at the first eight holes, the highlight of which was an eagle at the par-five fifth to approach the turn in 28. History: Kevin Sutherland became the first person to card a sub-60 round on the Champions Tour . Final: Remarkably, Sutherland actually made a bogey on the final hole of the round . He birdied the 10th and 11th and then added another three from the 15th, and only needed a par on the last to completea sensational 58.

"By . Pa Reporter . St Helens powered away from Wakefield in the second half to stay top of the First Utility Super League. Saints' much-changed team dominated the opening 40 minutes only to have just a six-point cushion to show for it at the break at 12-6 in front, but they found their killer instinct after the interval and ran out winners by seven tries to three. Tommy Makinson, Josh Jones and Shannon McDonnell scored two tries each, while Mark Percival kicked six goals. Leap of faith: Shannon McDonnell scored two tries in St Helens' 40-16 win over Wakefield . Nathan Brown shuffled his team again in the absence of his long-term casualties, with Paul Wellens moved up to scrum-half and replaced by debutant McDonnell at full-back. Fielding four props from the start, with Jordan Turner providing some variety to the Saints attack, the home side opted for power. Saints took an early lead when McDonnell's chip on the last tackle forced an error and from the subsequent free play Percival dabbed through for Makinson to touch down. There was the worrying sight of England hooker James Roby leaving the field on 15 minutes, but he was able to return with his leg strapped at the start of the second half. Saints enjoyed the lion's share of the ball, forcing a number of repeat sets with smart kicking from Turner, Gary Wheeler and Wellens. However, it was not until the 27th minute that they managed to breach the visitors' line, with quick hands from Wellens sending centre Jones cantering home. Trinity countered with a late flourish just before the break and were rewarded with a close-range score from Danny Washbrook, with Jarrod Sammut's goal cutting the deficit to six points at the break. Saints were quick out of the blocks in the second half and a super break from Percival, followed by a clever kick down the touchline, yielded a debut try for McDonnell. Percival added the magnificent conversion, but Trinity hit back shortly afterwards. Scrum-half Tim Smith was afforded all the time in the world to pick his spot on the right to loft the ball for Richard Owen to attack, out-jumping Matty Dawson to touch down. Frontrunners: St Helens Kyle Armor (C) in action at Langtree Park as St Helens secured top spot in the league . However, Saints' big men were determined to stamp their authority on the game and one of those - Sia Soliola - forced his way through from close range range. And then a great break from Roby, backed up by Turner, ended up with McDonnell chasing up in support from full-back to bag his second of the night. Jones added his second and, although Lee Gilmour grabbed a late consolation against his old club, Saints had the last word with Makinson completing his brace.

"By . Stephen Mcgowan For The Daily Mail . Kris Commons is weighing up his Parkhead future after he was axed from the starting XI for Tuesday’s Champions League defeat to Maribor. Celtic’s top scorer with 32 goals last season, the 31-year-old was deeply unhappy at beginning the dismal 1-0 defeat to the Slovenian champions on the bench. Commons – also a substitute for the first leg in Slovenia - is understood to have sought an explanation from coach Ronny Deila and, despite being introduced to the fray after 45 minutes, was the first player to leave the stadium at time-up. Going? Kris Commons could leave Celtic after he was dropped for the second leg against Maribor . A stand-out last season, the achievements of the attacking midfielder were marked by player of the year awards from PFA Scotland and the Scottish Football Writers last season. But with 12 months remaining on his current deal, Commons is likely to delay talks over a new contract until he receives assurances he will start under Deila. Norwich, Leicester and West Brom are all watching his situation, with the former Scotland international entitled to speak to other clubs from January. Asked after Maribor if Commons still had a future under his stewardship, Deila insisted: ‘Kris has played almost every game as long as I have been Celtic manager, so of course.’ Deila also faces a fight to keep hold of unsettled Virgil van Dijk after the Dutch defender claimed he wants to play in the Champions League. Sevilla have sold defender Federico Fazio to Spurs and have earmarked the 23-year-old as a potential replacement, with Newcastle also interested. Speaking to Dutch broadcasters NOS after the Maribor defeat, van Dijk said: ‘You want to play at the highest level and the Champions League is that. Decision time: Commons (second right) was Celtic's top scorer last season but could leave this week . ‘We’ll see what happens. Just now I am still a Celtic player. The transfer market is open until Sunday night.’ Ironically, Sevilla could be one of Celtic’s opponents in the Europa League with the Spanish side in pot one of Friday’s draw. Deila claimed on Tuesday night he still hopes to land two more new faces to bolster his flagging squad after completing a one-year loan deal for Ghanaian World Cup winger Wakaso Mubarak yesterday. Serbian striker Stefan Scepovic remains a £2million target, despite the 24-year-old claiming PSV Eindhoven also want him. ‘I know Celtic want me but the Sporting board has told me that so far they didn’t receive any offer from Scotland,’ the Serbian told media in his homeland. ‘But Sporting will sell me, that is for sure. They even told me not to train and play so I could not get injured. ‘Celtic? I would be happy to go there. But PSV is also big club and I must admit there are even more options. I think soon everything will be sorted out.’ Wanted: Celtic could make a move for Stefan Scepovic before the transfer deadline next week .","Kris Commons is debating whether he should leave Celtic .

Potters boss Mark Hughes revealed that Ireland has pulled a muscle in his rib cage and looks set to be out for 'a couple of weeks at least, but he is confident defender Robert Huth will overcome a slight knee problem to be available. Ruled out: Stephen Ireland (right) picked up an injury in training and will not be available for Stoke . The manager is weighing up whether it will be too soon, given his lack of game time in pre-season, to hand forward Victor Moses his Potters debut following his loan move from Chelsea, while defender Geoff Cameron and striker Peter Odemwingie, who both played at the World Cup, are poised to come into the squad after sitting out last week's campaign-opening loss to Aston Villa.

"By . Tom Roddy For Mailonline . West Ham manager Sam Allardyce is confident his team can beat Southampton in Saturday's Barclays Premier League clash despite their injury woes. The Hammers are without five players through injury while Diafra Sakho is doubtful for the encounter at Upton Park. The Senegal striker hurt his back during Tuesday's Capital One Cup exit to Sheffield United. 'We still have (Andy) Carroll, (Matthew) Jarvis, (Carl) Jenkinson, (Kevin) Nolan and (James) Collins out,' Allardyce said in Thursday's press conference. 'Sakho tweaked his back on Tuesday too so we're not sure if he'll be fit for Saturday. 'You don't want to be faced with that many injuries, but we're looking pretty good with the way we are playing.' Injuries mount up: Kevin Nolan (left) is set to miss six weeks of the season after suffering a fractured shoulder and winger Matthew Jarvis is also sidelined (right) due to injury . Out: Both James Collins (left) and new signing Carl Jenkinson (right) have hamstrings injuries . West Ham head into the game having been knocked out of the League Cup in the second round by the Blades. Allardyce made nine changes to the team that won 3-1 at Crystal Palace last weekend to face Nigel Clough's men. Despite a solid display, they lost 5-4 on penalties after Enner Valencia, who earned his first West Ham start against the Blades, missed the crucial penalty in the shootout following a 1-1 draw after 120 minutes. And Allardyce is disappointed he will not get the chance to blood more young players in the latter stages of the competition. 'It's a shame we got knocked out because it would have been great for the Burkes, the Pottses and the Poyets to play more in those type of games,' the 59-year-old manager said. 'We have to keep developing them in training. 'The young lads put on a good show.' Doubtful: Diafra Sakho is unlikely to be fit to face Southampton this Saturday after hurting his back during Tuesday's Capital Cup One tie with Sheffield United on Tuesday . Next up: Allardyce's (left) side face Ronald Koeman's (right) Southampton this Saturday . Allardyce has warned his players to expect a highly-motivated Southampton side on Saturday. The Saints lost 2-1 at Liverpool in their Premier League opener before holding West Brom to a goalless draw. Ronald Koeman's men travel to London again on the back of Tuesday's 2-0 triumph at Millwall that earned them a spot in the third round of the League Cup. 'With a new manager, Southampton will have players who want to impress him,' Allardyce said. 'Having watched the Liverpool game they put up a good performance and then got a draw at home. 'We need a little more consistency in front of goal and we'll be fine.' Allardyce revealed he is looking to make one more signing before the end of the transfer window but ruled out any further exits. 'We have the budget for one quality player and that's a possibility before the window shuts,' he said. 'I can't see anyone going the other way at the moment.

"By . Claire Bates . Updated: . 05:23 EST, 29 February 2012 . If you saw Evie playing with a group of her school friends, the only difference you might notice is that she is sometimes a little unsteady on her feet. Tragically her 'wobbly legs' are due to a devastating underlying condition, that will slowly rob the bright blonde girl of her physical abilities while leaving her mentally alert. The rare disorder known as ataxia-telangiectasia - A-T for short - is a progressive neurodegenerative disease that affects around 20 children in the UK each year. Most youngsters with the condition are wheelchair-bound by the age of 10 and few survive past their 18th birthdays. Big sister: Evie, 5, (pictured left with her brother Wilf, 3) has a condition that causes progressive disability and premature death. Her parents are campaigning for better awareness of the disease . Evie's father Toby Read, 37, said the day he and his wife Emily had received the diagnosis in September 2011 was the worst of their lives. 'We had read enough to know that it was incurable and that it would do terrible, terrible things to our daughter,' he said, while Mrs Read added they were 'absolutely shattered' by the news. Speaking to the Mail Online, Mr Read said: 'At the moment she goes to a normal school, which she loves. She is bright, loves writing, is learning to read and has many friends. 'One of the tragedies of this disease is . that the physical abilities she is just learning now will be taken away . from her. 'She will find it progressively harder and harder to control . her muscles and will slowly lose the ability to write, speak, walk, read . and even to swallow food unaided. 'She will lose none of her . intelligence but will instead have the frustration of not being able to . do the things she once could.' At risk: Toby and Emily discovered they both carry a rare gene mutation which meant each of their three children had a one in four chance of developing Ataxia-Telangiectasia . Mr Read, an insurance underwriter, and his wife Emily, 36, who runs an HR company from home and looks after their three children, have decided not to tell Evie about the difficult future she faces. 'Evie doesn't know about her . condition. She is aware there is something different about her and we have talked . to her about her wobbly legs that put her off balance,' Mr Read said. 'We are bracing . ourselves for when she is old enough to ask questions because we want to . protect her from this for as long as possible. 'This . summer we're hoping to take her to the Paralympics to get her . acclimatised to the idea of being in a wheelchair. We want to show her being physically disabled is not . the end of the world.' Babies with A-T appear ‘normal’ when they are born but can show a lack of balance when they start to walk. However, the physical impact of the disease is offset during the first few years by the child's natural rapid development. It means many children, like Evie, are not diagnosed until they reach the age of five. 'We went to see a specialist when . Evie was about two. She had been quite late in walking and had never . really stabilised,' Mr Read said. 'She always appeared a little off balance and had . trouble standing still. The specialist said she thought it was . hypermobility of the joints and suggested physiotherapy to stabilise her . movements.' Early symptoms: Evie displayed some balance problems as she learned to walk . My little girl: Mr Read said the day their received Evie's diagnosis was the worst of their lives . However, the couple sought help again after her primary school teachers told them Evie's fine motor skills were not developing as quickly as her classmates. A physiotherapist suggested she see a specialist and while they were waiting for an appointment Mrs Read found a website about A-T while searching for Evie's symptoms. 'We met with a specialist neurologist . two days later and she agreed that the symptoms, which included small red veins in the eyes, were consistent with A-T.' Evie at one-day-old: Babies with A-T do not display any symptoms . The condition is heriditary, which means while most children have a one in 100,000 of developing the disease, the couple's two sons - Wilf, 3, and Albie, nine-months - had a one in four chance of having it. After an anxious five-week wait for test results Mr and Mrs Read were told last year that their sons were just carriers - but Evie did have the disease. 'It was a strange feeling, as we were relieved for them but then knew we had to focus on Evie. Now it was real,' Mr Read said. The unrelenting disease affects a number of different bodily systems and has been described as like having the worst symptoms of cystic fibrosis, cerebral palsy and cancer. The majority of children go on to die from pneumonia as it causes life-threatening respiratory infections. Evie's parents are now working a large medical team from Great Ormond Street Hospital and the Royal Surrey Guildford to work as hard as they can to . preserve Evie's health and mobility for as long as they can. She takes antibiotics over winter to reduce her chance of developing infections that could lead to lung scarring, as well as doing physiotherapy exercise at home. Toby and Emily have registered a charity . Now her parents are determined to raise as much money as they can to fund research into the devastating condition. 'As A-T is so rare we thought it would be a lost cause trying to find scientists looking into the condition, but we found researchers are looking at many different aspects of the disease,' Mr Read said. 'We are not without hope that a cure can . be found in time for Evie and the medical experts have indicated that . these are promising times for children like her. However, because the . disease is so rare, funding is largely dependent on grass roots . donations . 'So this year our target is to raise £300,000 to further the projects. I'm running a triathlon in September with 20 other people and I'm planning to cycle 220km in the Alps with another group of fundraisers. We will push our bodies to the extreme as this is something Evie won't be able to do  when she gets older. 'We know we are in a race against time.'

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . A schoolgirl who suffers from a potentially deadly heart condition believes her beloved pet cat is responsible for saving her life. Maria Gillon, 13, suffers dozens of crippling chest pain attacks which stop her moving or talking due to ventricular tachycardia, which more than doubles her heart rate. She is often at risk of her heart stopping and is particularly vulnerable while sleeping in her room alone at night. Scroll down for video . Maria Gillon, 13, from Gorebridge, Midlothian suffers potentially fatal heart seizures. She says she owes her life to her lucky black cat Perla who raises the alarm . But Maria and her family are convinced her life has been saved several times by her black cat Perla, who recognises her attacks and nibbles the toes of her mother Adele, who jumps into action and calls 999. Ms Gillon, 32, from Midlothian, Scotland, said: 'Perla and Maria are inseparable. She even sleeps in Maria’s bed and stays with her through the night. 'If Maria has an attack, which can last up to 40 minutes, where she will be in such severe pain that she can’t speak or move, Perla will come into my bedroom and jump on me and bite my toes until I wake up. 'Perla then stays with Maria until she finishes the attack or until the ambulance crew arrive.' Maria suffers dozens of crippling chest pains which prevent her from moving or talking because of a condition called ventricular tachycardia . Maria was given Perla when she was an eight -week old kitten and Ms Gillon say, now three, she is very much part of the family. Adele adopted Perla as an eight-week-old kitten and she quickly became part of the family. But Maria’s life-saving relationship was put in jeopardy this summer when Perla came home bleeding from the mouth and with a swollen eye after being hit by a car. The pet was rushed to PDSA Edinburgh PetAid hospital where she was successfully treated and is now back at home with the family - and keeping watch over Maria. PDSA Edinburgh PetAid hospital veterinary surgeon Andrew Hogg carried out the operation in which broken parts of Perla’s jaw were surgically wired together, some teeth were removed and her split palate was repaired. He said: 'Perla looked a real mess when she came to see me, she had multiple head injuries. 'While Perla was staying with us she became a real favourite with the staff, despite her injuries she remained bright and won people over with her personality. 'What Perla does for Maria is wonderful. We don’t often get the chance to meet such clever cats and it’s wonderful that we were able to reunite them so that Perla can continue to be an inseparable companion for her.' Maria was booked in to have an operation to fix her heart defect, which causes signals in her heart to misfire and speed up the rate of her heart to up to 200bpm. Adele added: 'I am so grateful to PDSA for everything they’ve done for us. 'I had prepared Maria for the worst, but when PDSA called to say they had operated successfully we were overjoyed. We’re convinced PDSA worked miracles to save her that night. Perla, who recognises the attacks and raises the alarm with Maria's mum Adele, 32, who jumps into action and calls 999.

"By . Anna Hodgekiss . The parents of a dying toddler who captured the nation’s hearts when he was the best man at their wedding have been given the devastating news that a potentially lifesaving drug has failed to save him. Brave two-year-old cancer patient Charlie Harris-Beard started Aurora Kinase treatment earlier this month just days after he drove down the aisle at his parents’ wedding in his favourite remote controlled car. The revolutionary drug, which is administered over 72 hours every 21 days via intravenous infusion, is intended to inhibit cancer growth by blocking the enzymes which cause cancerous cells to grow. Devastating: Charlie was diagnosed with acute myeloid leukaemia on Easter Sunday 2011 . It was hoped the treatment would pave the way for Charlie to undergo radiotherapy treatment in the future and that it could potentially save his life. The courageous toddler finished the revolutionary trial at Birmingham Children’s Hospital on December 14 but last Thursday his heartbroken parents revealed the treatment had not worked. Taking to Charlie’s Facebook page ‘Help Save Baby Charlie Harris-Beard’, mum Fiona and dad Joe, both 30, said: ‘No easy way of saying this.

"By . Anna Hodgekiss . Hospitals are going into lockdown in a desperate bid to get the winter vomiting bug under control. Birmingham's City Hospital announced today that visitors are banned until further notice, after an outbreak of the bug forced the closure of four wards. Another major hospital has taken to Twitter, pleading with anyone who has recently had the bug - or suspects they may be infected - to stay away. Doncaster . & Bassetlaw Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust tweeted:  'Please, please, . please don't visit hospital if you've had vomiting or diarrhoea tummy . bug in last 48 hours (2 days)...!' Doncaster & Bassetlaw Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust has taken to Twitter, pleading with infected people to stay away . A spokeswoman for Birmingham's City Hospital said it was a precautionary measure, to stop the spread of the virus ahead of Christmas. In a statement, the hospital said: 'Members of the public are urged not to come to Accident and Emergency . Departments if they have diarrhoea and vomiting symptoms, unless they . need emergency medical treatment. Instead, they should telephone their . GP or NHS Direct. 'People suffering with symptoms who are due to attend the hospital for an appointment should telephone the hospital first.' Wards excluded by the ban are critical care, paediatrics, maternity, outpatients and the Birmingham & Midland Eye Centre. The spokeswoman said the restriction would hopefully be lifted within a week. Rachel Overfield, chief nurse at the hospital, told the BBC: ‘Norovirus is a problem that's out in . the community and it comes into hospitals and then causes us problems in . the hospital, so the more we can stop people coming and going… the more . likely we are to get on top of this quickly. ‘As soon as these things crop up on the . wards we isolate patients, make sure staff aren't moving around, close . the affected ward to visitors, increase cleaning and reinforce infection . control practice. 'We've currently got three wards confirmed with norovirus and a fourth ward that we're suspicious has norovirus, and then [possibly] a fifth ward down at Rowley Regis hospital as well.' Birmingham's City Hospital announced today it is closed to visitors, after an outbreak of the bug forced the closure of four wards . Ms Overfield said that about 34 patients are currently affected and a 'handful of staff'. Anyone showing . symptoms of the bug is urged to stay away, as it is highly contagious. The virus . spreads rapidly in closed environments such as hospitals, schools, . nursing and residential homes. Last week, patients at Chesterfield Royal Hospital were banned from receiving visitors, after a prolonged outbreak of the vomiting bug continued to plague the hospital. And last month, Warwick Hospital banned visitors from entering six wards at following an outbreak. Hundreds of hospital wards have been forced to close due to the spread of norovirus, as fears grow that this winter's outbreak could prove to be the worst on record. New figures released this week by the Health Protection Agency revealed cases of the bug are at a five-year high - with more than two-thirds as many people struck down this year as during the same period in 2011. The huge early outbreak is thought to represent the worst start to the norovirus season on record, with some experts blaming particularly frigid November temperatures for the staggering numbers of cases. The new HPA figures show there have been 2,630 confirmed cases - where samples have been checked in the lab - since July. This is 72 per cent higher than the same period in the last season when there were 1,533 cases reported. But this figure is likely to be only a fraction of the true total as most sufferers do not see their GP. Officials at the HPA estimate that for every confirmed case there are another 288 in the community. This means that 757,440 people could have been affected.","Birmingham's City Hospital has imposed the ban until further notice after an outbreak .

"By . Emma Robertson . Electric lights, including those which illuminate laptop computers, smartphones and tablets, often play a key role in causing people to sleep badly, a leading expert has warned. Artificial lights disrupt the body's natural rhythm, affect chemicals in the brain and drive people to use stimulants like caffeine to stay awake longer, according to Harvard academic Professor Charles Czeisler. Writing today in the journal Nature, the professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School called for research to help develop 'behavioural and technical' ways of counteracting the ill effects of artificial light on modern sleeping patterns. Screen breaks: Illuminated screens have been found to affect the body's circadian clock - the genetic mechanism which helps regulate sleep - 'more powerfully than any drug' The decline in the number of hours . slept per night is affecting public health, including a greater risk of . obesity, diabetes, heart disease, depression and stroke in adults and . concentration problems in children, he said. While all electric light affected circadian rhythms - the natural body clock - and sleep, night-time exposure to LED lights like those in phones and computers was 'typically more disruptive' than standard electric light bulbs, he said. 'There are many reasons why people get insufficient sleep in our 24/7 society, from early starts at work or school, or long commutes, to caffeine-rich food and drink,' he wrote. 'But the precipitating factor is an often unappreciated, technological breakthrough: the electric light. 'Without it, few people would use caffeine to stay awake at night. And light affects our circadian rhythms more powerfully than any drug.' Poor sleep has been linked with health problems including obesity, heart disease and depression . Between 1950 and 2000, the average person in the UK increased their use of artificial light sources by four times, with a parallel rise in sleep deficiency, Prof Czeisler said. Artificial light inhibits sleep-promoting neurons in the brain and the nightly release of the hormone melatonin, which aids sleep, while activating neurons that boost alertness, he said. It fools the brain into delaying its 'second wind', which kicked in during the afternoon to see people through to sunset before electric light was invented, until much later in the day. He said that as a result of modern technology 'many people are still checking email, doing homework or watching TV at midnight, with hardly a clue that it is the middle of the solar night'. In a study, 30 per cent of all working adults in the United States and 44 per cent of night workers reported getting less than six hours sleep a night on average. Fifty years ago less than 3 per cent of the US adult population slept so little. And around the world, children are sleeping 1.2 hours less on school nights than a century ago, he said. 'Technology has effectively decoupled us from the natural 24-hour day to which our bodies evolved, driving us to go to bed later,' he said. 'And we use caffeine in the morning to rise as early as we ever did, putting the squeeze on sleep.'","Laptop and smartphone screens disrupt sleep and make us drink caffeine .

"By . Sophie Borland . Dangers: Researchers have warned as many as one in three children born to mothers taking Epilim have developed autism or behavioural problems (file picture) An epilepsy drug taken by thousands of women has been linked to learning disabilities in children. Researchers say as many as one in three children born to mothers taking Epilim have developed autism or behavioural problems. They believe up to 17,500 children in Britain have been affected since 1973, when it was launched. Families campaigning for the manufacturer Sanofi to withdraw the drug are to meet Labour health spokesman Andy Burnham this week to enlist his support. Around 21,500 women of childbearing age take Epilim in the UK every year to control or prevent seizures. It is one of the registered trade names for sodium valproate, which affects electrical activity in the brain. But doctors have known for some time that the drug may cause developmental problems or deformities in babies. In Saturday’s Mail, writer Carol Sarler told how it had left her three-year-old granddaughter so profoundly brain damaged she could barely speak. Milly is due to start school next year but cannot even say her name, let alone read. Her mother Flynn was prescribed the drug for epilepsy and the family are convinced it affected Milly’s brain while she was in the womb. Academics at Liverpool University estimate that 35 per cent of the 48,000 to 50,000 women who have taken it since it came on the market have been affected. Their research, monitoring the development over six years of 243 babies born to mothers with epilepsy between 2000 and 2004, including 59 taking Epilim, is published in the Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery and Psychiatry. Rebecca Bromley, a senior neuro-psychologist at Liverpool University who led the study, said: ‘If sodium valproate is the treatment of choice, women should be provided with as much information as possible to enable them to make an informed decision. Research: Scientists believe up to 17,500 children in Britain have been affected since 1973, when the drug was launched . ‘But on no account should pregnant women just stop taking it for fear of harming their developing child.’ GPs have been advised for some time not to prescribe the drug to pregnant women due to the risks, but it is difficult for those already taking it to stop as the resulting seizures can also harm the baby. A spokesman for Sanofi said: ‘For some women of child-bearing potential, valproate may be the only effective seizure control medication; however, a decision to use valproate in women of child-bearing potential should only be taken after a very careful evaluation, between the patient and her treating physician, if the benefits of its use outweigh the risks to the unborn child. ‘This decision is to be taken before valproate is prescribed for the first time as well as before a woman already treated with valproate is planning a pregnancy.’ Medication: Academics at Liverpool University estimate 35 per cent of the 48,000 to 50,000 women who have taken it since it came on the market have been affected .","As many as one in three children born to mothers taking Epilim affected .

"By . Rachel Reilly . A dancer who was taken to hospital by her mother when she started suffering stomach pains was shocked to discover she was in labour and about to give birth. Jodie Smith, 17,  started feeling unwell last Monday night, but when her concerned mother Lesley, 47, took her to A&E in the early hours, doctors revealed she was pregnant and about to become a mother. Just hours later, on July 23, Miss Smith gave birth to son Jack Arthur, who weighed in at 8lbs, while shocked Lesley rushed to buy baby supplies. Keen dancer Jodie Smith, from West Yorkshire, (right) had no idea she was pregnant until she went into labour last month. She and her boyfriend Danny Yeoman, 19, (left) are thrilled with their new arrival but admit they do both feel 'shell-shocked' Miss Smith, a keen dancer from Carleton Glen in West Yorkshire, had no idea she was pregnant as she hadn’t put on any weight. Mother Mrs Smith, said: 'We are still a bit shell-shocked. Jodie hasn’t stopped smiling’. 'She has been going to college, going to work, doing her dance classes, going to the gym, all as normal. She wasn’t ill and looked just as slim all the way through.' She said Miss Smith started feeling unwell with stomach pains last Monday evening, while she and her husband Michael, 43, were out for the evening. Bouncing baby boy: Jodie gave birth to a little boy called Jack Arthur in the early hours of the morning on July 23. He weighed a healthy 8lb . Mrs Smith said: 'She’d gone to her . boyfriend’s, but came home because she was feeling so unwell. 'I told her . to take two paracetamol, but I got a call from her brother later that . evening saying Jodie was still poorly and had been sick.' 'At 1am she came and woke us up and I called the on-call GP, but they told us we’d have to go to the Wakefield walk-in clinic. 'She was in so much pain by then I knew we’d never get her there, so we took her to A&E.' Once at Pontefract Hospital, doctors quickly discovered Miss Smith was pregnant and in labour, and transferred her to Pinderfields in Wakefield, where she gave birth in the early hours. Midwives believe Jack was a couple of weeks overdue, and that at the very least he was full-term. New mother Jodie (centre) who sat her A-levels this summer, is still planning to go to college to study dance . As Miss Smith, a dancer, had no ante-natal car, doctors were initially unsure what stage the pregnancy was at - shortly before she went into labour . As she’d had no ante-natal care they were unsure what stage the pregnancy was at. New grandmother Mrs Smith added: 'I was in the supermarket at 6.30am buying baby stuff, because we had absolutely nothing. 'The midwives think Jack was a couple of weeks overdue, and certainly full-term. He’s had all his checks and he’s fine. Even they can’t believe it.' Miss Smith, who sat her A-levels this summer, is still planning to go to college to study dance. Her boyfriend, Danny Yeoman, 19, said: 'It’s been a shock, we’re still getting used to it.' Jack’s surprise arrival has also brought the family up to five living generations, and Mrs Smith said the family were delighted with the new arrival. She added: 'They’re all really pleased, but a bit overwhelmed at the moment.'","Jodie Smith, from West Yorkshire, developed pains in her lower abdomen .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Health regulators have issued a warning over some Chinese medicines, saying they contain 'dangerously high' levels of lead, mercury and arsenic. The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) said the unlicensed traditional Chinese medicines included some meant for children. None have been authorised for use in the UK but investigators have found them readily available on the internet. The MHRA's head of herbal policy, Richard Woodfield, said people should exercise extreme caution when buying unlicensed medicines . One product, which goes by a variety of names, was found to have 'extremely high' levels of arsenic by the Swedish National Food Agency, the MHRA said. The product is called Niu-Huang Chieh-tu-pein, Divya Kaishore Guggul or Chandraprabha Vatiand and is used for treating mumps, sore throat, tonsillitis, toothache, skin infections, anorexia and fever in young children. Another product, Bak Foong Pills, is used to relieve period pain but has been recalled in Hong Kong after it was found to contain up to twice the level of lead permitted by the Hong Kong government. One product called Hairegenerator, used for hair loss, has also been recalled in Hong Kong after a sample was found to contain 11 times the permitted level of mercury. The MHRA's head of herbal policy, Richard Woodfield, said people should exercise extreme caution when buying unlicensed medicines. 'The adulteration of traditional Chinese medicines with heavy metals is a significant international problem and can pose a serious risk to public health,' he said. 'Natural does not mean safe. To help you choose a herbal medicine that is suitable for you, look for a product that has a Traditional Herbal Registration (THR) or product licence number on the packaging.

"By . Sarah Griffiths . No two people smell scents the same way, which explains why some people find certain aromas appealing and others find the same smell stomach-churning. U.S scientists have found that a difference at the smallest level of DNA - one amino acid on one gene - can determine whether a person finds a given smell pleasant. They discovered there are almost a million variations on 400 smell receptors so that everyone smells things differently. Psychologists from Belgium found that bad body odour is commonly associated with vulnerability, which triggers feelings of concern. This, in turn, leads other people to pity the person with the odour and treat them more favourably than others . Researchers at Duke University in Durham, North Carolina, said a different amino acid on the same gene in a friend's body could mean they find the an odour offensive that you find pleasant. There are about 900,000 genetic variations on 400 smell receptors in our noses, according to the 1000 Genomes Project. These receptors control the sensors that determine how we smell odours, so a given scent will activate a suite of receptors in the nose, creating a specific signal for the brain. But Hiroaki Matsunami, associate professor of molecular genetics and microbiology at the university’s School of Medicine, said the receptors work differently for all of us. ‘There are many cases when you say you like the way something smells and other people don't. That's very common,’ he said. Hiroaki Matsunami (pictured) led a team of scientists who systematically explored the triggers for specific odour receptors in the nose. The researchers found that no two people apparently smell things the same way . ‘We found that individuals can be very different at the receptor levels, meaning that when we smell something, the receptors that are activated can be very different (from one person to the next) depending on your genome,’ Dr Matsunami said. He explained that when comparing the receptors in any two people, they should be about 30 per cent different, but this figure is conservative. While researchers have earlier identified the genes that encode for humans' odour receptors, it has been a mystery how the receptors are activated. To determine what turns the receptors on and why certain smells appeal to different people, his team cloned more than 500 receptors each from 20 people that had slight variations of only one or two amino acids. They then systematically subjected the molecules to different smells to see how they worked. There are about 900,000 genetic variations on 400 smell receptors in our noses, according to the 1000 Genomes Project. These receptors control the sensors that determine how we smell odours, so a given scent will activate a suite of receptors in the nose, creating a specific signal for the brain . By exposing each receptor to a very small . concentration of 73 aromas, such as vanillin (one of the chemical . constituents of the aroma and taste of vanilla) or guaiacol, (an oily . aromatic substance derived from wood creosote) the group was able to . identify 27 receptors that had a significant response to at least one . odorant. This finding, published in the December issue of Nature Neuroscience, doubles the number of known odorant-activated receptors, bringing the number to 40. Dr Matsunami said this research could have a big impact for fragrance, and food industries. ‘These manufacturers all want to know a rational way to produce new chemicals of interest, whether it's a new perfume or new-flavored ingredient, and right now there's no scientific basis for doing that,’ he said. ‘To do that, we need to know which receptors are being activated by certain chemicals and the consequences of those activations in terms of how we feel and smell.’","Researchers at Duke University, North Carolina, discovered there are almost a million variations on 400 smell receptors .

"By . Lucy Crossley . Millions of patients are being wrongly diagnosed with depression when they are simply sad, according to a new report . Million of patients are being wrongly diagnosed with depression when they are simply sad, according to a new report. Anti-depressants are being dished out to people grieving loved ones, suffering sexual problems or even unable to sleep, claims a newly-published scientific paper published by academics at Liverpool Unversity. The number of people diagnosed with mental illnesses like depression has doubled since 2002. It is believed more than five million people are now labelled depressed or suffering anxiety in the UK. Liverpool University's Professor of Primary Medical Care, Chris Dowrick, claims in a new report that up to half of these patients have been misdiagnosed. Writing in the British Medical Journal, the academic, who also works as a GP, said: 'Over-diagnosis is now more common than under diagnosis.' He has called for guidelines on diagnosing depression to be tightened and for pharmaceutical companies to be banned from marketing their drugs to GPs. 'Over recent decades there has been an increasing tendency, especially in primary care, to diagnose depression in patients presenting with sadness or distress and offer them anti-depressant medication,' he wrote. 'For GPs a diagnosis of depression may be an attractive instrument for managing uncertainty in the consulting room, especially as its commonest treatment comes in the form of a once-daily pill and is encouraged by clinical guidelines and indicators. 'But these pills won't work for people with mild depression, or who are sad, but they have side effects and we are seeing patients becoming reliant on drugs they do not need.' He added the problems began back in the 1980s, when qualifying symptoms for depression were lowered to include feeling sad, blue or down in the dumps for two weeks, or appetite change, sleep disturbance, drop in libido and tiredness. Dr Dowrick went on to explain that these symptoms were so common that most people would have them at some point in their lives. Professor Chris Dowrick, who also works as a GP, said that over-diagnosis is more common than under-diagnosis and called for guidelines on diagnosing depression to be tightened (file photo) Despite extensive research and calls from health professionals for the classification system to be revised, though, the worldwide boom in the prescription of anti-depressants has soared. In the UK, sales of anti-depressants have increased at a rate of 10per cent every year. Dr Dowrick and his team said drug companies had a part to play in the problem of over-diagnosis. He criticised their strategies of marketing drugs for mild depression and anxiety, making them be seen as conditions that required medication. He said: 'Often doctors do not know how effective the drugs are because they do not have full and accurate information on the research carried out by the pharmaceutical companies. 'Drug companies should be stopped from marketing antidepressant medication to physicians,' he wrote. However, mental health charities last night rejected his calls that depression is over-diagnosed. Jenny Edwards CBE, Chief Executive of the Mental Health Foundation, said: 'There is an increase in depression and anxiety that GPs are seeing because of the pressures people are facing from debt, unemployment and their effects on people's relationships. 'Diagnosing this as mental illness can be a crucial first step to help people get help. 'However it is vital that more is done to support GPs to offer a wider choice than just medication. 'Talking therapies can be reallyhelpful but the waiting times need to be slashed.' On Friday, it was revealed that drugs companies routinely withhold results of clinical trials from doctors, leaving them poorly informed about how to treat patients. The public accounts committee said it had 'extreme concern' that pharmaceutical companies only published around half of completed trial results and are more likely to hide unfavourable results. It called on the Government to make sure that full methods and results of all trials are opened up to wider scrutiny by doctors and researchers.","Chris Dowrick claims half of patients labelled depressed were misdiagnosed .

"By . Emma Innes . A mother given just two years to live set off on a farewell tour of the world with her three children - and ten years on she’s still loving life. Joanne Teague, then 39, kept it a secret from her children aged three to eight when doctors warned a heart defect meant her days were numbered. So she planned a series of tours with her husband and children to make the most of her 'mummy memories' with her young family. Mrs Teague, 50, has Ehlers-Danlos syndrome which means her organs and blood vessels are at risk of tearing. She is pictured recently with her husband, Danny, and children - Will, 18, Alice, 14, and Peter, 13 . Mrs Teague found a 'lust for life' as she toured Spain, Greece, Switzerland, France and Italy during a six-month trip. And she has surprised doctors by still leading a healthy life a decade later - and seeing herchildren Will, 18, Alice, 14 and Peter, 13, grow up. Mrs Teague took the trip to make some 'loving family memories' for her young children but didn’t tell them about the doctor’s warning. She said: 'I could have just given up and waited for the end. But I planned the trip - and it gave me a lust for life. 'It may have given me the passion to carry on living or maybe I’m just lucky. 'But whatever the reason, I’m so glad that I’ve seen my children grow up - and had some fantastic times together.' Mrs Teague (pictured with her husband Danny and children Will, Alice and Pete) was diagnosed after she had a heart attack at the age of just 39. The life expectancy for someone with EDS is only in the 40s . Mrs Teague and her husband took their children out of school and went travelling around Europe for six months to ensure they had lots of happy memories with their mother . Her congenital condition causes 'spontaneous ruptures of the tissue in her heart' meaning she’s at constant risk of a dangerous heart attack. It was discovered when Mrs Teague was rushed to hospital in after suffering a major heart attack aged just 39. She immediately underwent open heart surgery and a heart by-pass before she was diagnosed with Vascular Ehlers-Danlos syndrome eighteen months later. When they went on the trip, the children were aged between three and eight. They are now 18, 14 and 13 and Mrs Teague is still living a healthy and active life . Mrs Teague said: 'I could have just given up and waited for the end. But I planned the trip - and it gave me a lust for life. It may have given me the passion to carry on living or maybe I'm just lucky. But whatever the reason, I'm so glad that I've seen my children grow up' The incurable condition leaves sufferers with an average life expectancy in the 40s. She told her husband Danny, now 44, but the couple kept the sad news from their three young children. Mrs Teague planned a six month trip around Europe and then was planning to go even further around the globe. Mrs Teague, now 50, said: 'I was so frightened. It’s not something you ever want to hear as a person - never mind a mum of three little ones. 'The thought of one day not being around was too much to bear. I decided to make time and build some special family memories. When Mrs Teague was diagnosed, she told her husband Danny, now 44, but the couple kept the sad news from their three young children . Mrs Teague said: 'I was so frightened. It's not something you ever want to hear as a person - never mind a mum of three little ones' 'So we took them away to go sightseeing in Rome, to take in the fresh air of the Swiss Alps and to play and explore at Disneyland Paris . 'We piled our family of five into a people carrier and spent every minute together. 'It was trying at times but ultimately we had a fantastic trip exploring the big wide world together. I wouldn’t of had it any other way.' She said it helped educate her children - hands on geography, language and history lessons as they visited the Eiffel Tower, the Sistine Chapel and the Colosseum. The family went to France, Italy, Greece, Switzerland and Spain and travelled around in a people carrier . Mrs Teague said the trip helped educate her children as they received hands on geography, language and history lessons as they visited the Eiffel Tower, the Sistine Chapel and the Colosseum . After six months away, the couple decided to return home for the children to concentrate on their schooling. Mrs Teague, of Llantwit Major, near Cardiff, has defied the odds. She continues to live an active life, she has even returned to work part time as an occupational therapist. The threat of a repeat attack hangs over the busy mother - but she is determined not to let it blight her life. After six months away, the couple decided to return home for the children to concentrate on their schooling . Her brother Mark, 56, died in October last year from the same congenital condition. Mrs Teague knows how important it is to live each day to the full - and is bringing out a book by Candy Jar Books called 'See You in September' about her experience. She said: 'Having this condition changes the way you approach things. You don’t get het up about the little things. 'I don’t put things off but otherwise I try and keep my family life as normal as possible. Every day is a little extra for us.' Ehlers-Danlos syndrome is a group of inherited conditions that affect collagen proteins in the body causing them to be weak. Typical features are stretchy skin, loose joints and fragile body tissues. Collagen is a building block that strengthens and supports various body tissues - it is found in tendons, ligaments, cartilage, skin, bone, blood vessels and the spine. EDS is caused by alterations in certain genes - these can be passed from parents to their children but it is recessive so both parents have to be carriers for it to be passed on. The condition affects at least one person in every 5,000 in the UK. There are various different forms of EDS. All share some common features, such as loose joints, abnormal skin and fragile body tissues, but each form of EDS has unique characteristics too. The most severe form is Vascular EDS which causes the organs and blood vessels to be at risk of rupturing - this can be fatal. The life expectancy for people with Vascular EDS is in the 40s.

"By . Anna Hodgekiss . Anna Buckland was so terrified when her house was ransacked by burglars for the second time she went blind with fear . A woman was so terrified when her house was ransacked by burglars for the second time she went blind with fear. Anna Buckland, 57, cowered behind an ironing board in her kitchen when she heard Ryan Lewis smash his way into her home. Despite her terror, she called police who burst into the house and caught Lewis, 32. Ms Buckland's soaring blood pressure made her lose her sight and she has only just regained it two months later. Speaking after Lewis was jailed for three years, the former teacher said: 'I heard breaking glass. I was thinking it was outside, but it was quite loud. 'When I realised it was in my house, I froze - it was a big shock. 'I'm usually quite a confident person, but having to face up to maybe having to hurt somebody to protect myself was an awful experience.' Lewis raided Ms Buckland's home in Tuffley, Gloucestershire, on August 22. He carefully knocked on the door to see if anyone was home but Ms Buckland did not hear it. Despite hearing him shuffling through her home just metres from her hiding place, she was able to call police and direct them to her home. She said: 'I was planning to escape through the garden, but then I turned my attention to catching him. If I could keep it together, we could get him. 'I could hear him coming right up close to the door I was hiding behind. There were times when I knew he was so close. 'I assumed he was there to burgle, and if I kept quiet, I would be okay. It was a massive relief when the police arrived.' Officers . crept up to the house before dog handler PC Richard Brooks and his . German shepherd Obi burst through the door and apprehended Lewis. When Ryan Lewis (left) raided Ms Buckland's home, her soaring blood pressure made her lose her sight. She  has only just regained it two months later . Chief Insp Richard Burge, of Gloucestershire Police, said: 'We knew there was someone in the house and needed to contain the situation as quickly as possible. 'Lewis admitted eight other offences. If we had not stopped him then, he would not have stopped.' Lewis, of Gloucester, who was released from prison in June, asked for nine other offences to be taken into consideration at Gloucester Crown Court - including seven home burglaries. He was jailed for three years and ordered to pay a £120 victim surcharge. Sudden blindness is a rapid onset of vision loss which usually occurs in one eye only. Sometimes known as amaurosis fugax, it can be caused by a wide variety of factors. When people notice disturbances in their vision, they should consult an ophthalmologist immediately to get advice and treatment, as changes in someone's vision can be indicators of a stroke, dangerously high blood pressure, or another medical problem which requires immediate medical attention.","Anna Buckland, 57, cowered behind an ironing board in her kitchen when she heard Ryan Lewis smash his way into her home .

"By . Sarah Griffiths . British scientists are asking members of the public to take part in an online hearing test to explore whether modern life is damaging our ears. Approximately one in six adults in the UK have some degree of hearing loss and it is not clear whether listening to loud music plays a significant role. Scientists are especially interested in whether people’s listening past affects the way they hear the present. Approximately one in six adults in the UK have some hearing loss and it is not clear whether listening to loud music plays a part. To find out whether people of all ages are subjecting their ears to too much loud noise, the MRC has launched a mass participation study . The number of UK adults who struggle to hear in social situations with background sounds has increased by 12 per cent over the last two decades and is likely to rise further, according to figures published in the International Journal of Audiology. According to the World Health Organisation, the single largest cause of preventable hearing loss is loud noise, such as from heavy industry in work places and loud music. Researchers from the Medical Research Council and the National Institute of Health Research are questioning whether almost a century of amplified music has something to do with the prevalence of hearing difficulties. To find out, a mass participation study has been designed for all age groups and asks people to share information about their listening habits as well as test their hearing of speech against background noise. The study asks how often you go to concerts and discos, as well as how often you used to listen to personal music players, such as Walkmans, Diskmans and MP3 players, over different periods of time. It also asks more specific questions, such as, 'How often nowadays does any hearing difficulty restrict what you do socially or personally?' The experiment is available here. The number of UK adults who struggle to hear in social situations with background noise has increased by 12 per cent over the last two decades and is likely to rise further, according to figures published in the International Journal of Audiology . If a lifetime of noisy concerts and stereos turned up to the highest volume does lead to hearing loss, the scientists expect to see a correlation between the participants’ reported previous listening habits and current hearing abilities. Dr Michael Akeroyd, from the MRC Institute of Hearing Research, who is leading the project, said: ‘Many studies of music-related hearing loss have focused on musicians who may be exposed to loud music almost every day. ‘But far less is known about the cumulative effects of loud-music listening on the hearing of the general public. The primary purpose of this project is to determine if there is such a link. According to the World Health Organisation said the single largest cause of preventable hearing loss is loud noise, such as from heavy industry in work places as well as loud music at concerts and from personal music devices . The study asks how often you go to concerts and discos, as well as how often you use personal music players, such as Walkmans, Diskmans and MP3 players, over different periods of time as well as more specific questions about hearing . Over the past 100 years, advances in electronic amplification have transformed the way people listen to music from horn gramophones in 1923 to hugely powerful speakers at concerts and discos to personal stereos and now MP3 players. Action on Hearing Loss has long campaigned on the dangers of loud music and the importance of protecting and preserving hearing. Paul Breckell, the charity’s chief executive, said: ‘Damage to your hearing is irreversible and contrary to popular opinion, hearing loss is not a condition that only older people need to concern themselves with. ‘With many nightclubs and concerts . measuring 20 or 30 decibels above the safe noise level, more and more . young people are likely to start feeling the effects of their . music-loving, gig-going habits. ‘Hearing . loss not only rules out our enjoyment of music, but has the potential . to lead to unemployment, isolation and has even been linked to . dementia.’ Over the past 100 years, advances in electronic amplification have transformed the way people listen to music from horn gramophones in 1923 to speakers at concerts and discos to personal stereos and now MP3 players .","Approximately one in six adults in the UK .

"By . Emma Innes . A woman is so allergic to the sun that she has been forced to wear a full-length dress and a hijab every time she goes outside. Dennis Queen, 40, from Manchester, now wears the attire each time she goes outside, to protect herself from a severe allergic reaction. The mother-of-four suffers from a condition known as polymorphic light eruption  (PMLE) which causes her skin to break out in an itchy red rash after just a few minutes of sun exposure. Dennis Queen, 40, has polymorphic light eruption which means she develops an itch red rash if her skin is exposed to direct sunlight. She wears a hijab every time she goes out in order to protect herself . However, Ms Queen has found that donning a full-length dress called an 'abaya' and a hijab has been the answer to her problems, and allows her to carry on with normal life. She said: ‘When I first got PMLE I tried applying sun creams and wearing sun hats but nothing seemed to work. ‘The rash was unbearable and it got to the point that I was avoiding going out. ‘The hijab and abaya is the only thing that provides any real protection from the sun and I actually really enjoy wearing it now. ‘I was self-conscious to begin with, but I had a lot of encouragement from friends, and I actually find it quite liberating. ‘I’ve had some racist comments a few times but to be honest I don’t really care what a racist thinks of me.’ She says that when the rash (pictured) first appeared she did not know what it was so called an out-of-hours doctor who said that it could be a sun allergy . Ms Queen tried wearing suncream and hats to protect herself from the sun but this did not stop her suffering a reaction. She also looked at clothes designed for people with allergies but they were very expensive . The rash became so uncomfortable that she started to avoid going outside so as to prevent herself suffering a reaction . Ms Queen first noticed the rash after a long day outside in the sun. She said: ‘I’d been outside all day in a summer dress that exposed my neck, legs and arms. ‘I went back inside and I suddenly noticed I was getting itchy, and then a lumpy pink rash appeared. ‘I had no idea what was going on so I rang the out-of-hours doctor who said it sounded like I’d developed a sun allergy. ‘I’d heard of sun allergies before but I was still really shocked. It came out of nowhere. She realised that wearing a hijab (left) would cover her skin sufficiently to . prevent her suffering an allergic reaction and found that she could buy . them cheaply in charity shops. She is pictured (right) before the allergy . Ms Queen says that the main problem she races is racist comments from other people when she is out in her hijab. However, she says that she is happy with the decision she made . ‘I did some research and diagnosed myself with polymorphic light eruption. ‘The rash is incredibly itchy - that’s the first thing you notice - and when you scratch your skin it really hurts. It feels like you’ve been stung by stinging nettles.’ PMLE is a skin rash that occurs when a person is exposed to sunlight. It is not harmful but it can be very itchy. It most often occurs in the spring or when a sufferer is on holiday because their skin is not used to the sun. The rash tends to be short-lived and disappears completely within about a week if the person stays out of the sun. PMLE mostly affects people aged between 20 and 40 and is most common in women and people with fair skin. The rash can be caused by ultraviolet light or by visible light. Visible light can pass through glass so a reaction can occur to sunlight through a window. Treatment involves staying out of the sun and wearing protective clothing. Light therapy which involves gradually exposing the skin to increasing amounts of UV light can also help. As a result of her research, Ms Queen realised that covering up completely was her only option. She said: ‘At first I was so worried because I didn’t know how to cope with the condition. ‘It was very scary and trying to find clothes that were suitable was very difficult. They’d either be too expensive or expose too much skin. ‘I ended up looking a bit of a state - wearing long dresses with a jumper with the hood up. ‘But then I started looking online at allergy clothing and noticed that most of the outfits looked just like hijabs. ‘It became obvious to me that this was what I needed to wear to stay safe, but rather than buy expensive outfits on the internet, I just went to charity shops and brought second hand hijabs and head scarfs. ‘Now I just wear my ordinary clothes, with an abaya over the top and then a head scarf. ‘It just feels the same as putting a coat on. ‘I do miss wearing pretty dresses and I used to love dressing up, but I can still wear all my old clothes when the sun goes down.’ The biggest challenge Ms Queen says she has faced since her wardrobe change is the reaction of others to her unusual outfit choice. She said: ‘People immediately assume I’m Muslim. I don’t mind that but I find the racist comments just disgusting. Ms Queen says that she misses going out in pretty dresses but that she can wear them inside and in the evenings, after the sun has gone down . ‘I’ve been called a race traitor and it’s really opened my eyes to the kind of daily racism Muslims have to put up with. ‘All my Muslim friends have been so supportive of me wearing this, so it really upsets me. ‘I was genuinely shocked by the fear and hatred that people seem to have.’ Ms Queen now carries on with normal life, wearing a hijab when the sun is out. She said: ‘I’m really happy with the decision I made. Before she developed the allergy (pictured) she was able to sit out in the sun without suffering a reaction. She realised that the allergy had developed when she suddenly got a rash after spending a day outside . ‘Wearing a hijab means I can get one with my daily life and I don’t have to worry about my skin. ‘I feel confident and it’s made me a more understanding person. ‘I can only hope that people might read this and take the same decision that I have. You don’t need to spend lots of money on special clothing or the latest medicines. ‘You just need to take practical steps to cover yourself up.’","Dennis Queen has an allergy to sunlight called polymorphic light eruption .

"By . Jenny Hope . Growing resistance to antibiotics could lead to a tipping point where new infections are able to take hold in the UK, warns the director of the Wellcome Trust. Professor Jeremy Farrar said everyday medical practice would be affected because the ‘golden age of antibiotics’ was set to end. But the change would be gradual rather than the sudden emergence of new deadly bugs, he said. The director of the Wellcome Trust has warned that growing resistance to antibiotics could lead to a tipping point where new infections are able to take hold in the UK . ‘This is happening now’ Prof Farrar told the BBC Radio 4’s Today programme. ‘It’s been happening for the last decade or so or more and it will continue to happen. ‘What we will see is people actually spending longer in hospital, patients getting sicker and having complications and dying and it will creep up on us almost without us noticing. ‘This will not be the sort of contagion-like event of somebody landing from Hong Kong in London with a pneumonia that we’ve all feared. ‘This will creep is on us insidiously, and of course that’s in many ways more difficult to cope with’. He said complacency had set in during the 1970s and 1980s where there should have been more investment and antibiotics could have been used more wisely, for example in combination to deter resistance. Professor Jeremy Farrar said everyday medical practice would be affected while last year England’s chief medical officer Professor Dame Sally Davies warned resistance to antibiotics was a ‘ticking time bomb’ Prof Farrar, making his first major contribution as the new head of Britain’s biggest medical research charity, is the latest expert to warn of impending disaster from antibiotic resistance. Last year, England’s chief medical officer Professor Dame Sally Davies warned that resistance to antibiotics was a ‘ticking time bomb’ and one of the greatest threats to modern health. She said many of the drugs are being used unnecessarily for mild infections or illnesses which should not be treated with antibiotics - which is helping to create resistance. Around half of people in the UK do not know that antibiotics are inappropriate to treat colds, flu and viruses, according to evidence given yesterday (wed) to the Commons Science and Technology Committee. Public Health England’s director of public health strategy, Professor Anthony Kessel, said improving public awareness was critical. He said ‘My team have been asked to look at whether we can run a broader public health campaign about antimicrobial resistance in this country.’ The committee was also told there should be more research into the most effective duration of a course of antibiotics in a bid to reach the best and shortest level. Public Health England¿s director of public health strategy, Professor Anthony Kessel, said improving public awareness was critical . Prof Farrar said there were just four pharmaceutical companies working on antibiotics now - compared to 18 companies in the commercial sector 20 years ago. As a result only five new classes of antibiotics had emerged in the past 10 years. He called for more imaginative ways to incentivise the drug industry, for example through changes to patents protecting new brands and for regulation around clinical trials to be eased. Prof Farrar, who spent 18 years working in Vietnam where he saw firsthand resistance to TB drugs, said access to antibiotics needed to be regulated as they were available over the counter at low cost in many countries. He said ‘No government can do this on its own because this is a truly global issue. ‘This is getting to the tipping point where you will start to see this in you and your families and we will start to see this not in infections many, many miles away but her in London’ he added.","Professor Jeremy Farrar said everyday medical practice would be affected .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . A terrified patient mistakenly thought he had died during surgery after being given a full anaesthetic without his knowledge. John Carr, 65, had gone in for routine elective surgery to ease aches and pains in his right shoulder caused by arthritis - but was put to sleep in a potentially lethal medically induced coma. He only began to wake 20 hours after the procedure at Tameside Hospital in Ashton-under-Lyne, Greater Manchester unable to see a thing and hearing murmuring voices in the darkness. Nightmare: John Carr was supposed to be mildly sedated for surgery for arthritis pain. Instead he was given a full anaesthetic and woke 20 hours later - paralysed, unable to see and only hearing voices . The incident occurred despite Mr Carr’s orthopaedic surgeon warning doctors at the hospital - not to proceed with a general anaesthetic because it might be deadly due to his angina and heart problems. 'The hospital acted like a bull in a china shop with my treatment,' said Mr Carr, from Stalybridge. 'I remember waking up sometime after the operation and honestly thought I was dead. 'It was just total blackness and not just the sort you get when you close your eyes. I was hearing voices but unable to see anything. 'I was terrified as I was totally paralysed. I even cursed myself for believing that when you died all your senses left you because this was obviously not true as I could still hear voices. I feel really angry the hospital put me at risk like that. 'The way the staff behaved was like in a death camp of the modern world. If I knew what they were going to do then what I knew now I wouldn’t have gone through with it.' Mr Carr had developed arthritis as a result of heavy lifting during his job as a self employed plumber and kitchen fitter. He had been due to undergo a local . anaesthetic-type procedure known as as an Interscaline Pain Block with . mild sedation on the nerve so he would be awake . But . on the day of the surgery, the hospital’s two anaesthetists were on . leave despite a letter to the hospital’s Department of Anaesthesia . asking that someone be available. Oversight: Mr Carr has received a letter from Tameside Hospital admitting there had been 'a failure in internal communication' during a staff handover . A review of his medical records was held during an anaesthetic assessment, but it was agreed that general anaesthetic would only be administered to Mr Carr in a life saving procedure. Mr Carr added: 'I explicitly said I couldn’t have the general anaesthetic and that it was on my notes. 'I was told my heart was not strong enough to have it and it could lead to another heart attack and then death. 'I said I wasn’t going to sign for it but the doctor in duty that day told me he didn’t do pain blocks. I told him to find someone who did. I feel really angry that they put me at risk.' Mr Carr said he was then seen by another doctor who Mr Carr believed would carry out the procedure who injected him with 'a white cloudy liquid'. He added: “That was the last thing I remember. At no stage was there any discussion about any procedure, any risks, what drugs were being used, and how the assumed sedation would work. No one came by with the consent form to do the operation.” Before eventually coming round properly, Mr Carr drifted in and out of consciousness saying he was experiencing symptoms similar to 'psychedelic trips'. He said: 'I regained my sight later on and slowly the use of my limbs. This was when I recall coming round to be met by staff. I gestured to one to give me a pen and paper and I asked him if I was dying. 'When he said no and then asked him if I’d had a stroke as this seemed more plausible because of the paralysis. It was only when he said no and that I realised I was going to be okay. 'The hospital have overstepped the mark by operating without my consent. I should have been safeguarded. With my previous operations their first words are ‘have you consented’. 'I didn’t invite them to do what they did to me and in no way am I culpable. I was truly honest with them and said I didn’t feel like my heart was good enough for the operation under general anaesthetic, I know my own body. It’s fate that I’m still here today. Scared: Before eventually coming round, Mr Carr says he experienced symptoms similar to 'psychedelic trips' 'It was there in black and white not to proceed with the general anaesthetic, it was blatantly obvious. It’s not rocket science. I’m bewildered that it happened, it was not as if it was written in a foreign language. 'They still haven’t given me a reason as to why they gave me a general anaesthetic. The two people who do that procedure were both off that day. You would think they should have just said they couldn’t go ahead but they just did.' Mr Carr complained to PALS (Patient Advice and Liaison) and the complaints team at Tameside Hospital and received a letter admitting there had been 'a failure in internal communication' during a staff handover. In a statement, John Goodenough, Director of Nursing at Tameside Hospital said: 'A plan of action was agreed with Mr Carr and we acknowledge there were communication difficulties during the procedure. 'However, the clinical decision was made in the interest of patient safety.' In 2009 the hospital was identified as having the third highest mortality rate in England. Last July two previously unpublished critical reviews commissioned by the hospital emerged which revealed concerns about chronic under-staffing and sub-standard care.","John Carr, 65, had gone into Tameside Hospital for routine elective surgery to ease aches and pains in his right shoulder caused by arthritis .

"By . Emma Innes . These shocking images show the damage alcohol can do to the body - even at a young age. Mother-of-four Beverley Pickorer faces certain death from liver disease as a result of years of heavy drinking. The 35-year-old is plagued by epileptic seizures, her teeth are rotting, her stomach is swollen and her skin is thin and jaundiced. Now, her distraught partner Anthony Howard, 31, is pleading for her to be allowed to return to her home in Sheffield to die. Beverley Pickorer, 35, suffers from fits and liver disease as a result of years of heavy drinking. She suffers from epileptic seizures, has liver disease and her skin is thin and jaundiced . If his wishes are not granted, she will spend her last days being nursed around the clock at Haythorne Place Care Home, in Shiregreen. Ms Pickorer has been drink-dependent for years and at her worst was downing up to 24 cans of lager plus a bottle of perry - pear cider - in the morning, then visiting the pub, then drinking as many as 16 cans when she returned home. Her four children have all been taken into care. She has spent the last eight months . receiving palliative care in the home, where most other residents are . elderly. Before that, she spent four months in hospital. ‘I've been looking after my partner . for five-and-a-half years, and she's constantly been in and out of . hospital with liver cirrhosis,’ said Mr Howard. Ms Pickorer, 35, became dependent on drink when she was in her early 20s and drank up to 40 cans of lager and a bottle of pear cider a day. She is pictured with her partner, Anthony Howard, 31 . ‘She's the youngest person in this . care home. All she can do every day now is stay in bed. The staff come . and turn her over every two hours.’ Mr Howard said Ms Pickorer’s drinking problems started in her early 20s, during a series of troubled relationships. ‘When I met her I took her drinking as part of her, it's something I got used to,’ he said. ‘When she got up and had a can in her hand straight away, I got immune to it. To her it was like having a cup of tea. Ms Pickorer (pictured before alcohol ravaged her body) has four children but they have all been taken into care . ‘Beverley has four beautiful . children, they are now aged six to 15, and they have all been taken into . care because she can't look after them. ‘It's . tragic. We made an agreement that when she dies she would die in my . arms at home, but the NHS has said it would be too expensive to care for . her at home. ‘They . would have to pay for one carer and a nurse. She's on a syringe driver . to stop her having seizures. But Beverley wants to die at home and I . don't think you can deny a person that.’ Matt McMullen, from the Sheffield Alcohol Support Service, said Beverley's situation is ‘very sad’. ‘Unfortunately it is not unheard of for someone of such a young age to be experiencing such severe health problems as a result of alcohol consumption,’ said Mr McMullen, the service's activities co-ordinator. Kevin Clifford, chief nurse for NHS Sheffield Clinical Commissioning Group, said he was unable to comment on individual patients. ‘Whenever possible, the CCG looks to arrange care which meets the wishes of patients and their carers, as well as their care needs. However, in so doing, we have to consider the safest and most appropriate manner in which an individual's needs can be met. ‘It is always regrettable when we have to take a decision based on a patient's safety which doesn't meet the hopes of their family. ‘But we work with the family to offer . them a range of solutions, and endeavour to offer a care package that . is in the best interests of the patient and agreeable to the family.’ According . to NHS figures, between 2001 and 2009 there were 400 deaths per year in . people aged up to 39 where alcoholic liver disease was the underlying . cause. Ms Pickorer wants to return home to die but her partner has been told it would be too expensive to provide care for her outside of the nursing home . ‘The bottom line is, good quality help . is available in Sheffield and South Yorkshire, and the earlier someone . can access that help the better,’ Mr McMullen added. There are currently concerns about soaring rates of liver disease in Britain. Matt McMullen, from the Sheffield Alcohol Support Service, said Ms Pickorer's situation is 'very sad' Recent . figures show alcohol-related liver damage is becoming increasingly . common in the under-30s, with the number of hospital admissions in this . age group more than doubling between 2002 and 2012. Across . all age groups, an extra 1,000 people with alcohol-related liver damage . are being admitted to hospitals in England each year. Experts say few of these would be regarded by other members of the public as alcoholics. Rather they are apparently ordinary people who are unwittingly drinking too much. This includes middle-aged, middle-class women who enjoy a bottle of wine a day, or successful businessmen who have working lunches. It has also recently been revealed that an increasing number of mothers are drinking heavily. A survey of 1,000 mothers revealed a quarter have been drunk within the last month and one in six have, at some point in the past, been too hungover to be a good parent. The poll, commissioned by ITV’s This Morning, also found that 28 per cent of mothers with under-18s have been drunk in front of their children. While they are meant to be looking after their offspring, a quarter admit they have been so intoxicated that they have put even their own safety at risk. Worryingly, 33 per cent say they do not only drink socially with friends, they also drink when they are alone.","Beverley Pickorer became an alcoholic when she was in her early 20s .

"By . Emma Innes . A woman was left paralysed and unable to feed herself after doctors failed to realise she had an abscess in her neck. Jean Warne, 74, was left partially paralysed and unable to lift her arms shortly before her death in March last year. Her family say by the time doctors realised what was wrong, it was too late to save her. Jean Warne was paralysed after doctors failed to diagnosed an abscess in her neck until it was too late . They claim she was also left sitting on a soiled chair and that no one responded when she cried out in pain. They have instructed solicitors to sue Colchester General Hospital, Essex, claiming the lack of dignity Mrs Warne was treated with amounted to a breach of the Human Rights Act. Her son-in-law John Snowden, 64, said: ‘Jean was strong, she was feisty and her brain was working 100 per cent. ‘If she had been given the right treatment and care, she wouldn’t have gone the way she went.’ Shortly after Mrs Warne retired in 2000, she was diagnosed with breast cancer and had a mastectomy. But the cancer returned and spread to her spine, leaving her prone to suffering falls. Mrs Warne was admitted to Colchester General Hospital after a fall. She had breast cancer that had spread to her spine . Mr Snowden, of Braintree, Essex, said she would usually be checked over in hospital after a fall and released within a day. But after she was taken from her Gosfield home to Colchester General Hospital in mid-January 2013, her family decided to start looking at care homes she could move into. However, he claims the lack of care and attention his mother-in-law received at the hospital meant she deteriorated rapidly and was never able to leave. He said: ‘She was put in a seat in the mornings and just left there. Throughout that period, she was getting worse and worse. ‘She complained of a pain in her neck and in that time of sitting there an abscess formed in her neck, which eventually paralysed her. ‘She couldn’t even raise her arms to eat her food and they would just take it away. ‘She was left in her bed soiled and she was left in her seat soiled. You wouldn’t treat a dog like she was treated.’ Mr Snowden, a retired AA director, and his wife Melody, 51, visited every day and said they would have to feed her themselves. He added: ‘Melody went up there one day with a friend. ‘They walked in and Jean was in such neck pain, she was screaming out. The lady opposite said she was crying out all through the night and no one came. ‘All they used to do was put her in a private room because she was keeping the other patients awake. It was disgraceful.’ On March 5 2013, Mr and Mrs Snowden were told Mrs Warne had a suspected abscess. Doctors told them she was too frail to survive treatment and had only days to live. However, that night they received a call telling them Mrs Warne was being taken to Romford’s Queen’s Hospital for surgery. Ms Warne's family say staff at the hospital left her sitting in soiled clothes, that they didn't help her to eat when she was too ill to feed herself and that they did not respond when she cried out in pain . Mr Snowden contacted Queen’s and was told when she arrived they almost immediately realised she was too weak to deal with the anaesthetic. Mrs Warne was sent back to Colchester General Hospital, where she died that afternoon. Mr Snowden said they had an initial meeting with doctors who admitted they should have spotted the abscess sooner and should not have sent her to Queen’s. Afterwards, he wrote to former chief executive Dr Gordon Coutts to express his anger, and received a letter back offering a meeting. He refused and got in touch with Leigh Day solicitors. Ten months on, Mr Snowden said his wife, who has needed time off work, was still too upset and angry to speak about her mother’s care. Mrs Warne's family are now taking legal action against Colchester General Hospital . The couple are now pursuing legal action. He said: ‘We could just sit on this and let it go, but people should know about this. ‘At the end of the day, Colchester could go on doing exactly the same thing. ‘I hope the hospital gets its act together. It’s not going to happen overnight, but they must take some responsibility for the pain and suffering that they have given to patients and their families.’ A spokesman for Colchester Hospital University NHS Foundation Trust said: ‘We would like to pass on our sympathy and concerns to the family of this patient following her death in March last year, and are sorry and disappointed that they have concerns. ‘We received a complaint about this patient shortly after her death, which was investigated as a serious incident. ‘One of her consultants met the patient’s daughter and son-in-law and apologised to the patient’s family for some aspects of her care.’","Jean Warne, 74, had breast cancer that had spread to her spine .

"By . Lizzie Edmonds . Kristin Hallenga was 23 years old when she was diagnosed with stage four breast cancer. Just seven days later, medics told her the disease had spread to her spine. Her devastating diagnosis came almost 12 months after she first found a lump in her breast. 'It was really quite horrendous. I cannot put in to words how I felt,' Kris said this week. 'Stage four, advance – whatever you call it you know you are f****d.' After several rounds of chemotherapy, Kris, who will never be cancer-free and receives monthly treatment in hospital, is one of the most prolific cancer campaigners in the country thanks to her charity CoppaFeel!. Kristin Hallenga who, at 23, was diagnosed with stage four breast cancer and just one week later, she learned it had spread to her spine. Her diagnosis came 12 months after she first felt a lump in her breast . The organisation, known for its attention-grabbing campaigns and flash mobs, encourages young people to regularly check their breasts for lumps and other signs of cancer. Since its launch in 2009, CoppaFeel! has gone from strength to strength. As well as launching the Rethink Cancer campaign - which calls for schoolpupils to be educated about the signs and risks of the disease - Kris's remarkable story was recently featured in a BBC 3 documentary. Last month, CoppaFeel! was again in the media following the launch of the Check 'Em Tuesday campaign - which gained vast celebrity backing. Now the organisation are putting all their efforts in to the so-called bra hijack - which calls for lingerie manufacturers to sew labels into bras reminding women to check their breasts. Despite admitting her slow diagnosis made her 'lose faith in the medical system,' Kris, now 28, says her cancer changed her life in a positive way. Today, Kris reflected on her extraordinary achievements saying: 'I don’t like to use or talk about the . word terminal. You could say everyone’s life is terminal. 'But I am living . with something that is likely to kill me. 'I just hope I would have been as happy without cancer as I am with it - however odd that sounds. 'Before there was no plan - I was ambitious, but not one of these people who wanted to achieve great things. 'I am very proud of what we have done with CoppaFeel! And I am extremely happy with what I have done in my life.' The campaigner and sister Maren, left, - who together founded the charity as Kris was having chemotherapy . It was in early 2008 that Kris found a lump in her breast while on holiday in Barcelona with her mother, Jane, and sister Maren. On her return home, she went to her GP - who told her not to worry and the lump was most likely hormonal, or linked to her contraceptive pill. According to the ONS, breast cancer . is the most common form of cancer in England - accounting for 31 per . cent of all newly diagnosed cases. The . disease broadly falls into two groups. The first is non-invasive breast . cancer, which is found in the ducts of the breast and does not spread . outside the breast. The . second is invasive cancer, which can spread outside the breast. It is . the most common and it accounted for almost 90 per cent of new breast . cancer registrations in 2011. According to Cancer Research UK, in 2010, 49,564 women and 397 men in the UK were diagnosed with invasive breast cancer. In 2011, there were 11,684 female and 78 male deaths from invasive breast cancer in the UK. Between 2005-2009, 85.1 per cent of adult female breast cancer patients in England survived their cancer for five years or more. In 2010, 5,765 women and 26 men in the UK were diagnosed with in situ breast carcinoma. According to Coppafeel! women under the age of 30 are more likely to go to the opticians than check their breasts. 1 in 8 women are affected by cancer in the UK. Kris said: 'When I went to the GP, I didn’t really want her to say anything. I was about to go traveling to China. 'If I am honest, I had felt the lump . before then. I don’t know how long before. I did not think anything bad . of it. I thought it would go away.' Kris then went to China for six months and, on her return, went back to a doctor - this time with acute pain in her breast. He suggested she come off her contraceptive pill - and sent her away again. But her mother told her to ask for a referral to a breast clinic. Three weeks later, Kris was finally seen by a specialist. By this time, she had woken up in the morning with a blood-stained t-shirt. 'That was terrifying,' she said. 'I was staying at a friends when it happened and her mother is a nurse. 'She didn't want to say anything at the time, but she has said since how worried she was for me. 'It wasn't the first time I had discharged blood, either. But I still did not think it was cancer. You just don't think it will happen to you.' Finally, after several painful scans including an excruciating mammogram, a cancerous lump the size of an avocado was found in her breast - almost a year after she first went to her doctors. 'I cringe about it.,' Kris said, 'I think back and cringe about not seeing or acknowledging the signs. 'I do not want to blame myself though. It was lack of awareness. I did not think it would happen to me.' A medic who noticed Kris had pain in her back during one of her scans suggested she was tested for cancer in her spine. Kris added: 'I had been having pain in my back for a while - which I blamed on a skiing injury. I just knew deep down that it was cancer in my bones.' Seven days later, her fears were confirmed. It was during her first round of chemo that, feeling frustrated at the lack of help and support for younger cancer sufferers, she and Maren set up CoppaFeel! - which she says will continue to help people for many years to come. CoppaFeel!'s next move is to start targeting schools - training teachers to educate young people about their bodies and to get in to the habit of checking themselves at a young age. One of the charity's numerous fun, attention grabbing campaigns saw scores of women dressed as breasts taking to the London underground . To this end, they have launched . Rethink Cancer. Through the campaign, the charity are asking for student . teachers to be trained how to teach young people to look after their . health and that all secondary school students have time set aside in the . curriculum to learn about health issues. They ask that people write to their teachers or MPs demanding this is installed into secondary schools. 'That is the big one,' Kris said, 'I will die a very happy woman if we achieve that one.' The charity this week launched their #BraHijack campaign -  appealing to the lingerie world to introduce a small label reminding women to check themselves in bras sold in the UK. Maren and Kris (front left) take part in one of the charity's campaigns. CoppaFeel is now campaigning for better education of young people in schools through their Re Think Cancer initiative . CoppaFeel! has recently featured in the media following the start of the Check 'Em Tuesday campaign with The Sun newspaper. Cervical cancer is the most common . cancer among women aged 15–34. It is accountable for 16 per cent of all . cancers diagnosed in this age group (ONS). In the UK between 2009 and 2011, an . average of 181 and 130 cancer deaths per year occurred in males and . females aged 15-24 years, respectively. Cancer . is the most common cause of death in young women (15 per cent) and the . fourth most common in young men (9 per cent), according to Cancer . Research. However, less than one per cent of the total cancer deaths occur in 15-24 year olds. The scheme attracted a certain amount of controversy by anti page 3 campaigners who saw it as the newspaper's way of advocating topless modelling while cancer charities argued it trivialised the disease. One charity Breast Cancer Care, said using Page Three would be seen as 'ill-judged and insensitive' by patients or relatives. Prolific campaign group No More Page Three furthermore questioned why it was necessary to use 'sexualised' topless images to promote health messages. In response, Kris said: ‘It has been 80 . per cent positive. 'A lot of people are upset by it. But in order to get . our message across we have to do things that may upset some people.' As her work continues to go from strength to strength, Kris added that,as much as she loves her work, she will always put her health first. 'Obviously it wouldn't exist without it, but I have never really used my illness to promote the charity. 'Everyone has down days. 90 per cent of the time I am feeling well. 'I do not want people to treat me any different. But sometimes people should respect that I am trying to deal with my health. 'I do not want to do this because I am dying. I want to do this because I am living.'","Kristin Hallenga diagnosed with cancer 12 months after she found a lump .

"By . Emma Innes . Surgeons in Afghanistan have carried out a life-saving operation on a baby girl born with an extra head. Asree Gul, who is one of a pair of twins, was admitted to a hospital in the eastern city of Jalalabad with an extra head attached to her scalp, chief surgeon Ahmad Obaid Mojadidi said. He said: ‘Her mother gave birth to twins, two girls. Asree Gul, two-months-old, was born with an extra head attached to her skull. Doctors in Afghanistan operated to remove the extra head and the baby has now been released from hospital . ‘One girl was in good health but the other had an abnormality. She had an extra head attached to her head.’ ‘We separated the extra head from her body,’ he said a week after the operation which he described as the most sophisticated ever carried out in the impoverished city. The two-month-old baby whose parents are farmers was released from hospital yesterday. Surgeons believe that the extra head was part of a third baby that failed to develop properly in the womb. They said the surgery was complicated as vital blood vessels in Asree Gul's skull were attached to the extra head. Nematullah, Asree Gul’s father, said he had not expected his baby to survive the operation. ‘The doctors saved her life. I thank them,’ he said. The surgeons carried out the operation free of charge as Asree Gul's parents could not afford it. Asree Gul (left) is one of twins and her sister was born healthy. It is thought that her extra head was the result of a third baby who did not develop properly in the womb . Afghanistan, plagued by more than 30 years of war and still fighting a decade-long Taliban insurgency, lacks modern healthcare. However, facilities have improved thanks to the billions of dollars that have been pumped into the country by the international community in the last ten years. Last month, surgeons in New Delhi, India, separated one-year-old Nigerian twins who were joined at the hip and had spinal cord fusion. Hussaina and Hassana Badarus' surgery took 18 hours and was only the fourth such separation to be carried out in the world. The procedure - which cost an estimated £64,000 and was paid for by a Nigerian philanthropist - was so risky that doctors were forced to conduct practice runs on dummies before attempting it for real.","Asree Gul, one of twins, was born with an extra head attached to her scalp .

"By . Anna Hodgekiss . and Lizzie Parry . Hasina Ganchi was given the all-clear after a CT scan last July, but in August she suffered a brain haemorrhage . A mother-of-four suffered a brain haemorrhage after doctors gave her the all-clear when part of her brain scan results went missing. Royal Blackburn Hospital has apologised to Hasina Ganchi, admitting it is 'likely' a correct diagnosis would have prevented the 42-year-old's haemorrhage. The hospital wrote to Mrs Ganchi blaming a 'computer failure' for mistake, telling her a section of her CT scan had been unavailable to doctors considering her case. Otherwise, it said, radiologists would have been able to see she had a brain aneurysm. Mrs Ganchi, from Blackburn, had suffered headaches for more than a decade, prompting doctors to send her for a scan at the hospital in July last year. She was told the results were 'okay', but in August Mrs Ganchi collapsed while working at the family-owned takeaway. Mrs Ganchi, who is married to Noor, said: 'I have had headaches for 10 to 12 years but I was never referred to the hospital for an X-ray or anything. 'The medication kept going up and up and they said it was all sorts of things, such as depression.' Following her scan on July 5, she said she was given the all-clear. 'Then in August, I was at the shop and I had a dizzy spell,' she said. 'The people around said I was falling and they grabbed me.' Mrs Ganchi was taken to Royal Preston Hospital where scans showed she had had an aneurysm - a swelling of blood within an artery or vein. An official complaint was lodged against Royal Blackburn and Mrs Ganchi and her family met with hospital bosses earlier this month. She said: 'We wanted to keep a record of everything said in the meeting so we asked for them to record it and send us a copy. 'But when they sent the CD, it was blank. It just added insult to injury.' The Royal Blackburn Hospital has apologised to Mrs Ganchi, admitting it is 'likely' a correct diagnosis would have been made if a 'computer error' had not resulted in part of her brain scan going missing and being unavailable to doctors assessing her case . Mrs Ganchi said she was still suffering severe headaches, but the cause has never been diagnosed. She said: 'I can’t do things that I used to do and I am not myself. I sometimes wish I had just died when I had the haemorrhage.' In a letter sent after that meeting, radiology manager David O’Brien said after Mrs Ganchi’s first scan, it was decided a second scan with an injection of dye was needed and undertaken. 'While it is not possible to say with absolute certainty whether or not identifying the aneurysm earlier would have prevented you (Mrs Ganchi) suffering the haemorrhage, this is a likely possibility' - Radiology manager David O'Brien of the Royal Blackburn Hospital . However because of the computer problems, the findings of the second scan were not placed on her report. He said: 'When you had a further scan in August the radiologist referred back to your previous examination and noted that images demonstrated a 4mm aneurysm in the middle cerebral artery. 'While it is not possible to say with absolute certainty whether or not identifying the aneurysm earlier would have prevented you suffering the haemorrhage, this is a likely possibility. 'Please accept my sincere apologies on behalf of the directorate and indeed the trust for this system failure and for any additional suffering and anguish it may have caused.' He added that new procedures had been put in place to prevent similar incidents happening again. Chris Pearson, chief nurse at East Lancashire Hospitals NHS Trust, said: 'Patient confidentiality is of the utmost importance to us so we are unable to comment on individual cases.'","Hasina Ganchi had a CT scan at the Royal Blackburn Hospital last July .

"By . Lizzie Parry . Claire Hessan has been given the all clear after being diagnosed with the rare nasopharyngeal cancer . A mother-of-two who had a rare cancerous tumour growing behind her face was misdiagnosed by doctors who prescribed ear drops. Claire Hessan went to her GP after developing hearing loss, a strange itch in her ear and lumps in her neck after the birth of her second child in 2008. The 39-year-old was fitted with a grommet - a device fitted into the eardrum to allow air to pass into the middle ear and release pressure - and given ear drops. A string of experts concluded her problems were caused by pregnancy hormones. A year later Ms Hessan was sent for an MRI because her condition was showing no signs of improving. Returning to the doctor, further investigations revealed the true cause of Ms Hessan's symptoms - a huge tumour growing behind her nasal passage. The cancer, which had spread to her neck and cheeks, is so rare doctors at the Derriford Hospital in Plymouth, Devon said they see just one or two cases a year. Head and neck consultant Tass Malik, who treated Ms Hessan, said the cancer can be hard to spot because it lies hidden behind the nose, 'frequently presenting quite late'. It is rarely diagnosed in the West, but is more common in smog-plagued cities in China and other parts of Asia. Doctors treating the mother-of-two, from Callington in Cornwall, started her on an intensive course of radiotherapy and chemotherapy. For six months she was fed through a tube in her stomach, unable to to eat properly. But after losing five stone, Ms Hessan's body slowly recovered and she was given the all clear. Office manager Ms Hessan, who is mother to Owen, six, and daughter Teagan, eight, said: 'When I was six months pregnant I started to get a really itchy ear and they kept giving me ear drops and saying it was fine. 'They put a grommet in my ear and it was great it, I could hear again. 'But then I started getting lumps in my neck and went to the doctor who said it was pregnancy hormone related, as did the ear, nose and throat specialist. 'A third specialist sent me for an ultrasound on my neck, which came back clear. 'The children gave me the strength to fight through it. I said from the . start I didn't bring them into this world to leave them at such an . early age' - Claire Hessan . 'But when Owen had just turned one I went for an MRI scan and biopsy and they found that it was cancer. 'The doctors said it was a very rare tumour which is more prevalent in Asia. The closest I have got to going to China is having a Chinese. 'At first I just thought ""I’m going to die."" You think ""how long have I got to live, how am I going to pay the mortgage?"" 'My daughter Teagan was three at the time. It was the last thing I was expecting to hear. I was working full time as a PA having just gone back after maternity leave.' Ms Hessan’s treatment involved a series of exhausting five-day bouts of chemotherapy. She had a special surgical mask made for her so doctors at Derriford Hospital in Plymouth, Devon, would know the precise spots to target with their equipment. The mother-of-two first noticed the symptoms - a loss of hearing, a strange itch in her ear and a lump in her neck, after the birth of her son in 2008. Doctors prescribed her ear drops, before further investigations revealed a huge tumour growing behind her face, at the point which the nose meets the throat . Tass Malik, the consultant head and . neck surgeon who treated Claire Hessan at Derriford Hospital, said: 'The cancer . that Claire had is one of the rarer types. We see one or two cases per . year in this trust. 'The symptoms can be of slow onset because the cancer is hidden in the back of the nose, so it frequently presents quite late. 'Some patients have no symptoms until the cancer has spread to the neck lymph glands. 'Others . experience one-sided hearing loss due to fluid building up behind their . ear and others may experience nose bleeds and nasal blockages. 'Claire’s . case required a large dedicated team. 'Treatment included biopsies, to . determine the type of cancer, scans to allow us to pinpoint the location . and extent of the cancer, followed by treatment of chemotherapy and . radiotherapy. 'Claire . has been inspirational and has lots of inner strength, which helped her . to complete her challenging treatment. We would like to wish her all . the best in this year’s Race for Life.' By then, the cancer had spread to the back of Ms Hessan’s head and her collarbone but the fear of losing her children spurred her on. She said: 'My cheeks and face were burning. I had a wisdom tooth removed because they didn’t know what the problem was. 'The first few times at radiotherapy seemed quite easy but being on the table for such a long time for six weeks, I had to find something to focus on while lying there. 'My daughter Teagan had the cutest little bum wiggle ever and I used to lie there and think of that in my mind. 'I was suffering from dry mouth - it zapped my saliva glands. I was fed through my stomach for around six months. 'I had crates and crates of these milkshakes and it often went in my stomach and came back out my mouth - it’s meant to be the other way round. 'The children gave me the strength to fight through it. I said from the start I didn’t bring them into this world to leave them at such an early age.' Since being given the all-clear Ms Hessan has decided to raise funds for the battle against rare forms of cancer and is taking part in this year’s Race For Life event. Claire Hessan was diagnosed with a very rare form of cancer, which starts to grow behind the nose, where it meets the throat. Cases of nasopharyngeal cancer are very rare in the UK - with around 240 cases being diagnosed nationwide each year. It accounts for one in every 1,400 cancer cases diagnosed. It is more common in some ethnic groups living in the UK, for example people of Chinese origin. Experts do not know exactly what causes nasopharyngeal cancer, but a poor diet is thought to put people at risk. People who eat more fresh vegetables, . fresh fruit and other sources of vitamin C may have a lower risk of . developing nasopharyngeal cancer. It is more common in parts of Asia, Northern Africa and the Arctic that it is in Europe. Nasopharyngeal cancer is very rare in the West, affecting 240 people each year in the UK. It accounts for one in every 1,400 cancer cases diagnosed in the country each year. File picture shows cancer cells . Diets very high in salt cured meats and fish or pickled foods are more common in some of these places. These foods can be very high in nitrates and nitrities, which react with protein to form nitrosamines. These chemicals can damage DNA. Studies in China and Hong Kong have shown that babies and young people who eat Chinese cured and salted fish are at an especially high risk of nasopharyngeal cancer later in life. Other studies have looked at the link between certain viruses and developing nasopharyngeal cancer. Specific viruses cause genetic changes in cells that make them more likely to become cancerous in the future. It does not mean that cancers can be caught like an infection. There are links between the Epstein Barr virus and human papilloma virus are certain nasopharyngeal cancers. Those who have relatives who have suffered nasopharyngeal cancer, people who have had chronic ear, nose and throat diseases and smokers all have an increased risk of getting the disease. Symptoms of nasopharyngeal cancer include:- A lump or growth in the neck area that does not disappear after three weeks- Hearing loss- Tinnitus- Fluid collection in the ear- Blocked nose, especially on one side- Blood stained discharge from the nose- Headache- Double vision- Numbness in the lower part of the face- Difficulty in swallowing- Changes in voice - such as hoarseness .

"By . Mark Howarth . The secret to happiness could lie in something as simple as a tuna sandwich or cod and chips. Eating fish can keep the blues at bay, according to a new study – but only in women. Researchers discovered that having seafood on the menu at least twice a week reduces the risk of depression among females by 25 per cent. However, for men, fish had no protective effect. The secret to happiness could lie in something as simple as a tuna sandwich or cod and chips. Eating fish can keep the blues at bay, according to a new study - but only in women . The paper – published in the American Journal of Epidemiology – speculates that high levels of omega-3 fatty acids may combine with the female sex hormones oestrogen and progesterone to keep the brain functioning properly. A team from the Menzies Research Institute in Tasmania, Australia, tracked more than 1,400 men and women aged between 26 and 36 for a period of five years. The participants kept diaries of their diet – including various types of seafood including fish, prawns and mussels - while details about their mental health were also collated. Even after taking into account lifestyle factors such as smoking, weight, exercise, alcohol consumption, education and employment status, a strong link was found between eating fish and incidence of depression. The study states: ‘For women, there was a trend for each additional weekly serving of fish to reduce the risk of having depression during follow-up by six per cent. ‘Women who ate fish more than two times per week at baseline had a 25 per cent lower risk of having depression during follow-up than those who ate fish less than two times per week. ‘For men, baseline fish consumption was not associated with the risk of depression.’ It adds: ‘The observed protective association for women but not for men may have been due to men consuming more omega-3 fatty acids from other dietary sources, particularly from meat. Researchers discovered that having seafood on the menu at least twice a week reduces the risk of depression among females by 25 per cent . ‘Alternatively, interactions between sex hormones and omega-3 fatty acids might provide another explanation. ‘These findings add to the growing evidence that fish consumption may be beneficial for women’s mental health.’ Dr Richard Marsh, chief executive of the Institute of Food, Brain and Behaviour, said: “Part of the brain is formed from omega 3 long chain fatty acids commonly found in oily fish. ‘There have been other studies that indicate that eating oily fish might have an impact on mood. ‘This study has reached an interesting conclusion that the benefits are seen purely in women, however, it remains unclear what factors are at play here and further research would be necessary to confirm this result. ‘What is beyond argument, though, is that the human body, including the brain, requires appropriate nutrition to function properly and that, in some instances, deficiencies can and do manifest themselves in conditions such as depression. ‘Consumption of oily fish can promote good health in many ways as part of a balanced diet.’ Around five million Britons are living with depression at any one time with up to one in five people affected at some point in their lives. Research shows women are more than twice as likely to fall victim, mostly between the ages of 16 and 42 as they try to balance work and family life. Rates have soared since the 1970s and depression is now recognised as a predictor of risk for diseases such as Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s. Dietitian Dr Sarah Schenker said: ‘The fatty acids in fish are long chain so can be readily used by the body whereas they are short chain in meat so have to be adapted. ‘If men consume more food but are more reliant on meat for their fatty acids than women, it would perhaps explain why the positive effects of fish on depression are seen only in women in this study. ‘Long chain fatty acids have been proven to be good for brain health. ‘It’s recommended that people eat two portions of fish a week, one of them oily, such as mackerel, fresh tuna, salmon or sardines. ‘But shellfish and white fish are also nutrient-rich and can stop deficiencies in key minerals such as zinc and iodine. ‘This study shows again why people should stop looking at food simply as fuel and think more broadly. ‘It doesn’t take much to tweak your diet and reap considerable health benefits.’","Having seafood at least twice a week reduces the risk of depression .

"By . Lizzie Parry . A new invention aiming to improve posture by vibrating when people slump in their chairs, could help prevent back pain. UpRight is a wearable device that sticks to the lower back with a gentle hypoallergenic adhesive. Using multiple sensors the device vibrates gently when posture starts to worsen. It was designed to combat the 'posture epidemic' - a phenomenon caused by the sheer number of hours we spend hunched in front of computers. UpRight is a new device, which sticks to a person's back and vibrates when it senses slouching . Bad posture not only causes back pain, but it has negative effects on respiration, internal organ function and even productivity. By providing gentle vibrating reminders to sit up straight, UpRight hopes to be a daily reminder of the importance of a straight spine. It can even connect to a special mobile app which has an individual training programme developed by experts. Users can see daily goals, receive posture analytics or statistics and motivate family and friends who are also using the app. Creators boast the programme could even help users master their posture without the device after just a few weeks. The creator and founder of UpRight, Oded Cohen, said: 'The idea for UpRight came many years back as I wanted to assist my mum with her slouching habit. It's creators hope the invention will help combat the 'posture epidemic', which is causing more people to suffer back pain . 'Unfortunately, I waited too long. In the past year my mum has been suffering from lower back pain and now needs regular pain relief medications.' Having finalised the product's design, UpRight is now part of a 60-day crowdfunding program on Indiegogo.com and there are hopes to take the product to market by July 2015. Ugandan born Mr Cohen, said: 'It's very exciting to have an idea that will actually improve people's lives and health. 'But now we need support to make the idea a reality. 'In return, our funders get to look younger, taller, leaner, more confident and successful and most important, live a healthy life with less back pain.' UpRight has a four-day battery life, a USB port for charging and inbuilt bluetooth. It's smart silicone design weighs just 30 grams and measures just 10cm in length. It is expected to cost around £75. Osteopath Thomas Parry, of Parry Physical Health, said maintaining good posture allows the body to function efficiently. The Suffolk-based practitioner said by sitting badly at work, slouching in the car or walking with rounded shoulders, people compromise their posture, putting excess strain on different parts of the body, which over time can lead to pain and in some cases structural changes in the body. He said to maintain good posture it is vital to regularly move around, taking breaks from sitting or standing in one position. He said: 'Bad posture can lead to breathing difficulties, it can slow down your digestive system, as well as causing the more common complaints of low back pain, neck and shoulder pain, tension headaches, aching through the hips and more. 'People often come to see me after they’ve injured themselves doing something at the weekend, like working in the garden, but often the problem stems from the posture they have adopted during the preceding days. 'I advise many of my patients to imagine they are a string puppet being pulled up through the top of their head, which engages your core muscles and in turn your shoulders will drop, your neck will elongate and your rib cage will lift. 'This allows you to breath more easily and reduces the load on your lumbar spine. My patients often tell me they are lighter on their feet as a result.'","UpRight is a wearable device that sticks to a person's lower back .

"By . Anna Hodgekiss . A grandfather given 18 months to live after he was diagnosed with leukaemia has had his life saved by two umbilical cords. David Pyne, 60, underwent a remarkable stem cell transplant using the babies’ cords after all other treatments were exhausted. Patients with cancers such as leukaemia need blood stem cells to replace their own damaged cells and cells taken from babies' donated cords can now be used for bone marrow transplants. Hope: David Pyne (with wife Susan),  underwent a stem cell transplant for his leukeamia using blood from umbilical cords after all other treatments were exhausted . The . cords are rich in stem cells, which can grow into healthy blood. And . because newborns have not been exposed to infections, their stem cells . are less likely to attack the immune system. Mr Pyne said: 'I was truly amazed when my doctor at The Christie Hospital in Manchester said we could use this option. 'To think that two newborns saved an old man’s life is just marvellous and it’s given me more time with my own grandchildren.' The father-of-four and grandfather-of-seven, from Baguley, Wythenshawe, was diagnosed with leukaemia following routine blood tests in August 2012. He began chemotherapy and blood transfusions and in 2012, a search for a stem cell donor was launched. But no members of his family proved a match and no other donors could be found - leaving him with a life expectancy of around 12 to 18 months. Cord blood is taken from a baby's umbilical cord soon after birth. A machine is used to spin the blood and separate off the stem cells. These are then frozen until needed (the rest of the blood is discarded). Once a match has been found, the patient has chemotherapy, and . sometimes radiotherapy, to destroy their cancerous white blood cells. During the transplant, relatively few stem cells are used - around 100ml - which are given like a blood transfusion. Once in the bloodstream, the cells find their way to the bone marrow and start producing healthy blood cells. Patients spend several weeks in hospital while their immune system recovers. Then last September, he underwent the . transplant using stem cells from the umbilical cords of a baby born in . America and one born in France. The childrens' parents . had already agreed to allow the stems cells to be harvested and banked . with a view to helping save another person’s life. The two donor babies were found to be a good match and their cells were flown to The Christie Hospital. The technique is available on the NHS and the hospital has carried out six similar transplants in the past year. Mr . Pyne said: 'Things were looking pretty grim until I got the news about . the possibility of an umbilical cord stem cell transplant. 'The team from The Christie found two separate umbilical cord donors that were a good match. I just felt elated. 'It was something to hope for - like a lifeline was being thrown to you. I grabbed it with both hands and hoped for the best.' During the procedure, Mr Pyne spent six . weeks in hospital. Stem cells from the second cord began to work and his . condition slowly began to improve. Dr Mike Dennis, director of the . haematology and transplant unit at The Christie, said: 'Umbilical cord . blood is very rich in stem cells, which being so immature has phenomenal . regenerative powers . 'These . were a great, alternative source of cells for David - in fact the only . option - as after a worldwide search he had no other available donor.' Relief: Mr Pyne said: 'To think that two newborns saved an old man's life is just marvellous and it's given me more time with my own grandchildren' The first line of treatment in cancer of the blood is chemotherapy, but . if that fails then doctors consider a bone marrow transplant. Around . 1,100 patients in Britain have these transplants every year - mainly for . leukaemia but also for disorders such as sickle cell anaemia. A . good match is important if the patient's body is not to reject the . healthy donor bone marrow. Dr Mike Dennis, director of the haematology and transplant unit at The Christie, said the cord blood was Mr Pyne's last option . Thirty per cent of patients find a match . among their relatives; another 50 per cent are successfully matched with . donors from bone marrow registers. In recent years, it has been discovered that blood taken from babies’ umbilical cords and placentas is rich in life-saving stem cells that can be used for transplants. But around 65,000 litres of cord blood are still discarded following births in Britain. It is estimated that around 400 patients miss out on vital treatment because of a lack of suitable stem cell donors. If 50,000 units of cord blood were saved, 80 per cent of transplant requests in Britain could be met. An increasing number of pregnant women here are being asked if they want to donate their baby’s umbilical cord and placenta. The blood is also collected in countries including the US, Germany, France and Spain. It is totally risk-free and does not interfere with the baby’s delivery. The blood is collected from the umbilical cord by a specialist nurse shortly after a baby has been born. The Anthony Nolan Trust, Britain’s blood cancer charity and bone marrow register, hosts a collection centre in Nottingham where cord blood is stored. It collects cord blood at hospitals in London, Birmingham and Leicester and aims to collect 15,000 cord blood units by the end of this year. Cord blood can also be donated through the NHS at six hospitals in London. The NHS has its own cord blood bank in Bristol, which contains more than 20,000 units.

"By . Lizzie Parry . Stress triggers a person's compulsion to comfort eat, a new study at the Monell Chemical Senses Centre in the U.S. has found . Feeling stressed encourages people to comfort eating, a new study has revealed. Hormones activated when a person feels anxious or worried have been discovered in taste cells, which identify sweet, savoury and bitter flavours. The findings could explain why many people dip their hand into the biscuit tin or raid the fridge when they come under pressure. Researcher Dr Rockwell Parker, a chemical ecologist, said: 'Sweet taste could be particularly affected by stress. 'Our results may provide a molecular mechanism to help explain why some people eat more sugary foods when they are experiencing intense stress.' He said he believes the hormones glucocorticoids act directly on taste receptor cells when a person is stressed, affecting how they respond to sugars and certain other foods. Glucocorticoids affect the body by activating specialised receptors inside cells. Knowing stress can have major effects on metabolism and diet experiments on mice showed their tongues contained receptors for them. The highest concentrations were found in those sensitive to sweet and savoury taste, reports the journal Neuroscience Letters. The study showed stressed mice had 77 per cent more hormone receptors in the nucleus of taste cells than those that were more relaxed. It suggests the perception of sweet food . - which is known to be altered by stress - could be specifically . affected by the secretion of glucocorticoids and subsequent activation . of their receptors in the tongue. Dr Parker, of Monell Chemical Senses Centre in the U.S., said: 'Taste provides one of our initial evaluations of potential foods. 'If this sense can be directly affected by stress-related hormonal changes our food interaction will likewise be altered.' He said although stress is known to . affect intake of salty foods the hormone receptors were not found in . cells thought to be responsible for detecting this taste - or sour. Researchers noted a person experiencing anxiety or worry were particularly likely to crave sugary foods . One explanation is stress could influence salt taste processing in the brain. The researchers say the implications of their findings extend beyond the oral taste system because taste receptors are found throughout the body. Study co-author Dr Robert Margolskee, a molecular neurobiologist, said: 'Taste receptors in the gut and pancreas might also be influenced by stress - potentially impacting metabolism of sugars and other nutrients and affecting appetite.' About three-in-four people in the UK are now overweight or obese - with comfort eating identified as one of the causes. A study of 500 schoolchildren in Belgium showed those with high levels of the stress hormone cortisol and who turned to food gained body fat.","Study carried out in U.S. found feelings of anxiety or worry stimulated a person's desire to comfort eat .

"By . Lizzie Parry . Toby Hart was left severely disabled after medics failed to 'act upon' his abnormal heartbeat leaving him brain damaged . A High Court judge has awarded a seven-year-old boy £12million compensation after he was left severely disabled when doctors failed to 'act upon' an abnormal heartbeat when he was born. Toby Hart, from Bedale in North Yorkshire, will need 24-hour care for the rest of his life, Mrs Justice Nicola Davies was today told at a High Court hearing in London. She gave her backing to a settlement - which included a £2million lump sum and annual payments of nearly £500,000 - agreed between lawyers representing Toby's parents Michelle and Matthew Hart, and Friarage Hospital in Northallerton. Mr and Mrs Hart today called for the NHS to invest in better midwife training. Law firm Irwin Mitchell, which represented the couple at the hearing, said in a statement after today's hearing that problems arose during Toby's birth in October 2006. The newborn's abnormal heartbeat 'was not acted upon', they said. The firm said a settlement had been agreed with the South Tees Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust. 'During his birth at the Friarage Hospital in Northallerton in October 2006, Toby’s heart rate slowed drastically but medical staff failed to spot he was in distress and he was born 25 minutes later than he should have been, starving his brain of oxygen and leaving him permanently brain damaged,' said an Irwin Mitchell spokesman in the statement. '(We) have now secured the family a £2 million lump sum to help cover costs of treatments, therapies, specialist equipment and adaptations that they need to their home. 'Toby will also receive annual payments of up to £490,000 for the rest of his life. 'This is believed to be the largest annual payment ever agreed and will be managed by Irwin Mitchell to ensure that the funds last for the correct amount of time.' He said the payments added up to a £12 million settlement. The spokesman said Toby - who was at today’s hearing with his parents - suffered from cerebral palsy, epilepsy, had a severe learning disability, was registered blind and would need 24-hour care, support and rehabilitation for the rest of his life. Mrs Hart said: 'Although nothing can . turn back the clock and undo the mistakes made during Toby’s birth, it . is a massive relief to know that his care and rehabilitation needs for . the rest of his life will be taken care of by the final settlement. 'Being . thrust into this situation without any warning when Toby was born . opened our eyes to the lack of support for new parents of babies with . birth injuries. Toby, now seven years old, and pictured with his father Matthew Hart, suffers cerebral palsy, epilepsy, has a severe learning disability, was registered blind and needs 24-hour care, support and rehabilitation for the rest of his life . 'In the first few years we had to wade through all the . administration and systems to apply for things such as therapies and . chairs to help him sit up - thankfully now we will be able to support . him using the settlement. 'We . are incredibly grateful to Irwin Mitchell for their support as we felt . extremely isolated when we first left hospital. 'There was very little . help available and more needs to be done to assist parents who suddenly . find themselves having to care for a baby who has suffered a birth . injury as we did. 'Although nothing can . turn back the clock and undo the mistakes made during Toby’s birth, it . is a massive relief to know that his care and rehabilitation needs for . the rest of his life will be taken care of' - Toby's mother, Michelle Hart . 'All the . current support for parents is focused on being a good mother to a . ‘normal’ healthy baby and the last thing we wanted was to be around . other parents whose situation didn’t bear any resemblance to our new . lives. 'We constantly had to battle to get support, equipment and . therapies that Toby needed and it just highlights how important the . settlement is in ensuring that his quality of life is as comfortable as . possible for the rest of his life. 'Midwives need to be fully aware and accountable for the . consequences of their actions within the delivery room. 'For example, . does the current midwifery training and ‘updates’ for qualified staff . include meeting parents of children who had sustained life-changing . injuries as a result of a mismanaged birth? 'Their . practice and responsibility has to move away from the confines of the . delivery room if the real impact and importance of their role is to be . fully understood. 'There has to be a shift towards doing everything they . can to prevent babies being born with brain damage.' A High Court judge has given her backing to a £12million compensation settlement agreed between lawyers acting for Mr and Mrs Hart and the hospital trust. It includes a £2million lump sum and annual payments of £500,000 for the rest of his life . Angela Kirtley, a specialist medical negligence lawyer at Irwin Mitchell, said Toby’s parents had been 'incredibly resilient'. 'The mistakes made during his birth were unacceptable and have had a life-changing effect not just on Toby, but the entire family and all those close to them,' she said. 'He will be dependent on carers forever and it was vital that they received the support they needed.' Mrs Justice Nicola Davies told Mr and Mrs Hart at the hearing the she hoped the money would give the family a better quality of life. 'I know you have battled on Toby’s behalf,' said the judge. 'I hope that what this money does is to give you some peace of mind. 'There is at least in place some financial stability. I know nothing can turn the clock back.' A spokeswoman for South Tees Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust said: 'We are sorry that the care afforded to Mrs Hart and to Toby fell below an acceptable standard and that Toby suffered very substantial injuries as a result. 'The trust acknowledges that no amount of money can compensate adequately for the damage suffered but it is hoped at least that the agreed sum will give some financial security and provide for Toby's needs now and in the future.'","Toby Hart was born at Friarage Hospital in Northallerton in October 2006 .

"By . Lizzie Parry . Bride-to-be Claire Atkins delayed lifesaving chemotherapy so she could keep her natural hair for her wedding day . A bride-to-be battling breast cancer delayed lifesaving chemotherapy to keep her natural hair for her wedding day. School secretary Claire Atkins, 41, asked doctors to postpone her treatment for a month to avoid wearing a wig on her big day. And instead of heading off to enjoy a honeymoon with her new husband, Mrs Atkins began a course of lifesaving chemotherapy just three days after tying the knot. Four months ago, she was declared cancer-free. The mother-of-three, from Hempstead in Kent, said: 'I knew I didn't want to wear a hairpiece. 'We had booked our wedding date and venue and I was adamant that I would have my own hair when I got married.' Two months after giving birth to her daughter Rose in August 2012, Mrs Atkins discovered a lump on the surface of her left breast. Doctors diagnosed it as a blocked milk duct, but she was told to return if any further lumps appeared. In February 2013, she discovered several more lumps beneath the skin and was sent for an ultrasound at Medway Maritime Hospital in Gillingham. Mrs Atkins said: 'The nurse wasn’t happy to see a white chalky space on the scan, so I was sent for a mammogram. 'I had an immediate biopsy and two weeks later I recieved the results that I had breast cancer. I was shocked and scared, but my fiance Jason was with me.' Mrs Atkins, who has two older children, Charlie, 17, and Libby, 13, decided to bring forward her wedding to fiance Jason, 39, a sales consultant. She said: 'Jason and I knew we wanted to get married and having the diagnosis put things in focus. 'We thought, ""let’s just do it"". It was very helpful to have something really positive to focus on.' Preliminary surgery revealed that Mrs Atkins had a stage three invasive tumour in her breast. Scroll down for video . Mrs Atkins pictured on her wedding day last July with her son Charlie Stevens, 17, her daughter Libby Stevens, 13, holding Rose, 22 months, her husband Jason Atkins, 39 and his sons Tommy, 10 and Joe, eight . Mrs Atkins discovered a lump on the surface of her left breast shortly after the birth of her daughter Rose in August 2012 (left). Doctors initially diagnosed a blocked breast duct but in February 2013 the mother-of-three discovered several more lumps, and tests revealed she had breast cancer . After gaining a second opinion on the best course of treatment at the Royal Marsden Hospital in London, she was told to prepare for the surgical removal of the lump, followed by radiotherapy, chemotherapy and longer-term targeted medication. She said: 'The idea of chemotherapy was frightening. I’d heard such harsh stories about the sickness I should expect. 'We had booked our wedding date and venue and I was adamant that I would have my own hair when I got married' - Claire Atkins . 'I also knew I would lose my hair for the wedding if the treatment started straight away. 'Having found the wedding so helpful to focus on, I wanted the actual event to be just how we imagined it to be. 'The doctors were satisfied that because the cancerous tissue had already been removed surgically, it was safe to put off the chemotherapy until the end of the following month.' Mr and Mrs Atkins tied the knot in front of family and friends on July 20, 2013. Mrs Atkins said: 'It was a very emotional day, considering what we were going through. 'Our families made speeches acknowledging how important all of our friends are in our lives.' Three days later, she started her first round of chemotherapy. Instead of jetting off on honeymoon, three days after her wedding, Mrs Atkins started a lifesaving course of chemotherapy, causing her to lose her hair (left). In February this year she was declared cancer-free (right) She said: 'I felt extremely tired, but I didn’t feel quite as sick as I expected to. I decided to wear scarves instead of wigs, which I found hot and itchy.' Despite a worrying wait, Mrs Atkins was declared cancer-free following a mammogram in February. She said: 'I’m over the moon, of course, but the experience has changed me. I’ll always carry a level of concern that the cancer might return, and I lost a lot of my femininity. 'It will take a year or so before my hair grows back to the way it was, and by then I’ll be ready to return to my old self again. 'Now I advise all women to check themselves regularly. If I hadn’t been so diligent in looking out for lumps before my diagnosis, it might have been missed and I might not be here today. 'I also believe that breast cancer screening should be routinely offered to women under the age of 50. 'I’ve heard of cases of younger women with concerns being palmed off simply because of their age. 'The truth is that younger women get breast cancer too.'","Claire Atkins discovered a lump in her breast two months after giving birth .

"By . Lizzie Parry . Some hair dyes may still contain banned compounds thought to increase a person's risk of developing cancer, it has emerged. A glitch in the production process could have resulted in carcinogenic chemicals getting into dyes and perming products, Swedish scientists warned. Researchers at Lund University found that hairdressers had a high concentration of toluidines -  banned from EU products - in their blood. The chemicals were found in higher concentrations in hairdressers who apply light-colour permanent dyes and those who perform perms on their clients. Scientists have raised fears that hairdressers could be at risk of developing bladder cancer, after a study showed high levels of a banned carcinogenic compound in the bloodstream of a group taking part in the Swedish study . The dangerous chemicals, which are linked to bladder cancer, were banned by the EU in the early 1990s. Scientists involved in the study said they fear the complexity of some hair products mean that toluidines could still be found in modern hair dyes due to contamination in the production process. They measured the . levels of eight carcinogenic compounds, including toluidines, in the . blood of 295 female hairdressers, 32 regular users of hair dyes, and 50 . people who had not used any dyes or perms for 12 months. It was revealed that for people who . regularly came into contact with hair dye or perming products, the levels . of toluidines were higher, leaving them at higher risk of bladder . cancer. The levels rose in . tandem with how often they came into contact with dyes or perming . products, according to the study published in the BMJ. Experts warned that in the 1970s . around 90 per cent of commercial hair dyes contained carcinogenic . substances, prompting restrictions in their use. And . they called for more research into dying and perming products to find . out the cause of increased toluidine levels in the blood of people who . regularly come into contact with them. Dr . Gabriella Johansson, from Lund University’s Division of Occupational . and Environmental Medicine, in Sweden said: 'We believe there is some . kind of contamination in the production process which we need to . investigate. No-one really knows. 'In the late 1970s there were carcinogenic compounds in hair dyes that were later banned. 'There’s . still a massive debate on whether there are still carcinogenic . compounds present in modern hair dyes. We still really have no idea . what’s in some of these products, they’re so complex. The dangerous chemicals, toluidines, were banned by the EU in the early 1990s, after fears they caused bladder cancer. File picture of bladder cancer cells under the microscope . 'It’s important to keep exposure to carcinogenic compounds as low as possible. 'The current knowledge on consumers using hair dye is conflicting- some studies show it increases the risk of cancer. 'For . hair dyes it’s important to work properly with gloves when you apply . the colour and then you apply it to the hair, you have to be so careful. 'We . believe that the main exposure is skin contact. Our study shows that . there might be a possible exposure from modern hair dyes. 'Our study the main focus was hairdressers as they come into regular contact with these products. 'By regular we mean weekly for professionals, monthly for consumers. 'People using hair dye should be using disposable gloves and should try to minimise skin contact as much as possible. 'Another . important thing to do research wise is look at hair dye products and . analyse them to see if you can see an exposure of toluidines in . different types of hair dye.'","Swedish scientists say those who use certain dyes regularly - weekly for professionals or monthly for consumers - may be at risk .

J’ssiah was diagnosed with a rare form of cancer - acute myeloid leukaemia - in June 2013, when he was just one. The toddler underwent several rounds of gruelling chemotherapy but the cancer remained. When six-year-old Kyerell proved to a transplant match for J’ssiah, he immediately offered to undergo surgery to save his baby brother’s life.

"By . Emily Payne . A hospital accused of making 'serious errors' in the care of a child has become the subject of an independent inquiry. Luke Jenkins, from Cardiff, was admitted to Bristol Children’s Hospital for routine heart surgery in April 2012. But the seven-year-old, who was expected to make a full recovery, died from a cardiac arrest. Inquiry: Luke Jenkins, celebrating his 1st birthday at the Children's Hospital of Wales, in Cardiff. He died six years later during routine surgery . In . November 2013, a coroner recorded a narrative conclusion, but his . family maintain the hospital could have done more to save . him. Now . an independent inquiry has been launched into the children’s cardiac . unit, which has been accused of making 'serious errors' in Luke's . treatment. The Bristol Review into cardiac services at the hospital, which was opened yesterday, aims to gather evidence from aggrieved families who claim they have suffered at the hands of staff. The hospital was accused of a catalogue of neglect and mistreatment of babies and children with heart problems. Last year, it emerged that around 10 families were believed to be taking legal action against the trust, including seven whose children died following treatment at the hospital. Luke’s mother Faye Valentine, who has campaigned for improvements in quality of care, believes her son’s death was preventable. She said: 'Nothing will bring Luke back - we just want to seek justice. Grieving: Luke's parents Steve Jenkins and Faye Valentine believe that their son Luke's death was preventable . 'It feels like we have been pushing for . this for a long time, but we are hopeful something good will come of it. We cannot be negative about it. 'All we want the hospital to do is accept they were wrong in the treatment of my son. My main concern is making the hospital a safe place.' Launching the inquiry in Bristol, Eleanor Grey QC, who has been commissioned by NHS England to conduct the review, said confidentiality and support for witnesses would be an 'important principle' of its work. She said: 'We won’t be having any public hearings. We want witnesses to feel as free and as well-supported as possible when they give their evidence. 'They will be free to bring a friend or a trade union representative, for example. We will also be offering independent, professional emotional support for participants, provided free under the NHS.' Ms Grey said the review will examine care provided to children with congenital heart disease and the experiences of parents and carers from March 2010 until the present day. Luke Jenkins, pictured with his grandad Paul Valentine, died following a routine heart operation . It will look at all the respective cardiac services delivered, both in Bristol and through clinics closer to families’ homes. Ms Grey . said March 2010 was the date when new quality and safety standards were . set but events before this date 'may well be relevant'. The experiences of all potential witnesses will be valuable, she said, whether they are positive, negative or mixed.

"By . Lizzie Parry . An impending 'health crisis' is threatening the NHS as the majority of people entering old age are overweight, experts said today. New figures show almost three quarters of people aged 45 to 74 in England are either overweight or obese. Young adults are the only age group which have a normal average body mass index (BMI), according to the statistics from the Health and Social Care Information Centre. The National Obesity Forum today warned a large proportion of the population will face significant problems as they enter old age. Experts have warned of a 'looming health crisis' as more people enter old age overweight or obese . Being overweight or obese can lead to a number of potentially life-threatening conditions including type 2 diabetes, coronary heart disease, some types of cancer, such as breast cancer and bowel cancer, and stroke. Tam Fry of the National Obesity Forum said: 'These figures show that there is a looming health crisis for the nation. 'If you think that obesity is just for the young and the middle aged then you are wrong. 'There needs to be a clear message that everybody needs to take control and watch what they are eating.' He warned that many overweight elderly people are in a 'catch 22' situation because they are suffering a combination of problems linked to being overweight and muscle wastage - so they cannot exercise to improve their health. The HSCIC figures show that there is a rising tide in the proportion of people who are overweight or obese. At least seven in 10 people in England aged 45 and over are either overweight or obese. And the average BMI measurement of those aged 45 to 74 is 28.3 - those with a BMI of 25 to 29.9 are considered to be overweight. Professor Martin Severs, a geriatrician from Portsmouth and HSCIC lead clinician, said: 'Obesity is going to have a lot of short to medium effects around diabetes and heart disease. 'And then you have got long term issues because your body will be carrying around a lot more weight, you then go on to suffer problems such as arthritis and having difficulty breathing. New figures released today by the Health and Social Care Information Centre reveal that almost three quarters of 45 to 74 year olds in England are either overweight or obese . 'There is a whole set of second-order things as a consequence of weight.' When . asked what impact the growing number of overweight and obese older . people will have on society, he said: 'There are potentially a number of . scenarios, one is that you get less older people because they get . illnesses (as a result of) obesity younger and therefore there is a . mortality effect. 'The second possibility is that the life expectancy of older people plateaus and starts to drop. 'The third possible interpretation is . that the disability-free life expectancy starts to shorten. But I don’t . have enough evidence to say which one or combination of those scenarios . could happen.' The proportion of people entering old age being either obese or overweight could lead to a 'health crisis', experts have warned. The . below figures show the proportion of the population in different age . groups who are overweight or obese, and the average body mass index . (BMI) of people in that age bracket. People . are deemed to be of normal weight if they have a BMI score of 18.5 to . 24.9 and overweight with a score of over 25. Those with a BMI over 30 . are deemed to be obese. Charity Age UK warned that public health measures are mostly aimed at younger and not older people. Ruthe Isden, health influencing . programme director at the charity, said: 'Historically public health . approaches have been very focused on children and it’s all about getting . them while they are young and if you are old then ""it’s a bit late to . bother"". 'There is a really important need to turn some of that around and actually start talking to people about how it’s never too late to adopt healthy behaviours.' She said just a 'tiny' proportion of older people get the recommended amounts of exercise, adding: 'In the 75-plus population it’s something as low as four per cent of people getting their recommended weekly amounts of exercise so we do have a really big issue here with obesity and inactivity.' The new HSCIC data, which focuses on the health and care of older people also shows that the population aged 65 and over is rapidly rising. In 1951, 4.5 million people were aged 65 and above but by 2051 this number is expected to rise to 16.6 million. While people in this age bracket account for just one in six of the population, they take up one in every two hospital beds, the figures show. Janet Morrison, chief executive of charity Independent Age, said: 'These figures show that older people are the main users of the NHS and are most likely to be affected by any cuts in services as a result of funding problems. 'If we are going to expect more older people to get treated outside of hospital, we need realistic levels of funding for councils to provide community care.' Dr Alison Tedstone, chief nutritionist at Public Health England (PHE), said: 'There is no easy answer to reducing obesity; it is a complex issue that requires action at individual, family, local and national levels. Being overweight or obese increases the risk of developing type 2 diabetes, heart disease and certain cancers. 'Excess weight can also be associated with low self-esteem and mental health issues. PHE is committed to helping tackle overweight and obesity in adults of all ages through a range of approaches that support action on the local environment to make eating less and being more physically active easier, with many local authorities already working hard to achieve this.'","New figures show a rising tide of people who are overweight or obese .

"By . Lizzie Parry . A cancer-stricken bride married her sweetheart in hospital after fearing her big day would be cancelled because of her treatment. Joann Howells, 46, had resigned herself to postponing her wedding to partner Neil Ward, 45, after starting treatment for lung cancer. But when the 46-year-old told nurses and staff at Worthing Hospital in West Sussex of her disappointment at delaying her big day, they set about ensuring her dream wedding could still go ahead on the planned date. Cancer patient Joann Howells married her sweetheart Neil Ward after staff at Worthing Hospital rallied round to ensure the 46-year-old did not have to postpone her big day after being diagnosed with lung cancer . An emergency licence was granted to enable them to wed in the hospital chapel, and an appeal on a local radio station led to flowers, decorations, food and drink being donated by businesses. Hospital chefs baked the wedding cake and supplied canapes and sandwiches for the reception, which was held in a day room at the hospital. And nurses and other staff worked through their lunch breaks to ensure the rooms were transformed, including scattering rose petals on the chapel floor. Ms Howells, from East Preston, said: 'It was so special, just overwhelming, with everybody helping to make our day come together.' She added: 'I wanted to go home so I could get married, and I was just thinking I was stuck in hospital, and then they just did it all for us.' An emergency licence was granted to enable the couple to wed in the hospital chapel, and an appeal on a local radio station led to flowers, decorations, food and drink being donated. Hospital chefs baked the wedding cake and supplied canapes and sandwiches for the reception, which was held in a day room at the hospital . The service was led by assistant chaplain, the Reverend Linda Rowlinson, whose theme for her address was 'love is kind'. The Rev Rowlinson said: 'It was a very special day, especially because the bride is so poorly, and knowing the great challenge they are facing in their marriage.' Mr Ward said: 'We cannot thank people enough to be honest. 'You don’t realise how kind people are until something like this happens. It is really, really amazing.' Ms Howells went home last Thursday following eight days in hospital. Her daughter, Jessica Kelleway, 23, said: 'They could not have put a bigger smile on her face.'","Joann Howells married her sweetheart Neil Ward at Worthing Hospital .

"By . Lizzie Parry . NHS bosses have warned pregnant women against using a specific type of home birthing pool after a baby became infected with Legionnaire's disease . NHS bosses have warned pregnant women against using a specific type of birthing pool at home after a baby born in one was infected with Legionnaire's disease. The newborn is in intensive care and is described as being 'severely ill'. Samples taken from the heated birthing pool have confirmed the presence of legionella bacteria, which causes Legionnaires' disease - a serious lung infection. Experts are carrying out tests to establish if it is the same strain as that which infected the baby. Public Health England (PHE) and NHS England today advised against the use of the pools, which have built-in heaters and recirculation pumps, and can be filled two weeks before the birth. It is the first reported case of Legionnaire's disease linked to a birthing pool in England, PHE said. Professor Nick Phin, PHE’s head of Legionnaires’ disease, said: 'This is an extremely unusual situation, which we are taking very seriously. 'As a precaution, we advise that heated birthing pools, filled in advance of labour and where the temperature is then maintained by use of a heater and pump, are not used in the home setting, while we investigate further and until definitive advice on disinfection and safety is available.' NHS England issued a Patient Safety Alert to notify the healthcare system - and midwives in particular - of the possible risk associated with the use of the heated birthing pools at home. The alert recommends that heated birthing pools are not used for labour or birth. A full risk assessment is being carried out in the meantime. Heated pools from the supplier involved in the incident have been recalled, PHE said. There are around 10 firms which supply the specific pools and each have between two and 14, which they loan out. The pools are typically delivered around a fortnight before the expected delivery date and filled from the domestic hot water supply. The temperature is then maintained by a pump and heater until labour and delivery, with the companies recommending various disinfection regimes. PHE said the majority of birthing pools used at home are filled from domestic hot water systems at the time of labour and these do not pose the same risk and are not included in the alert. Prof Phin said: 'We do not have concerns about purchased or hired pools that are filled from domestic hot water supplies at the onset of labour, provided that any pumps are used solely for pool emptying. The newborn was rushed to intensive care and is said to be 'severely ill'. Samples taken from the birthing pool confirmed the presence of legionella bacteria (pictured) which causes the lung disease . 'PHE and relevant local authorities . are investigating the infection control measures required for this type . of birthing pool and local authorities will be working with the small . number of companies who supply these heated birthing pools for use at . home.' Louise Silverton, . director for midwifery at the Royal College of Midwives, said: 'Women . planning birth at home using a traditional pool that is filled when the . woman is in labour or using a fixed pool in an NHS unit are not affected . by this alert and should not be concerned. Legionnaire's disease is a serious lung infection caused by legionella bacteria. Initial symptoms include a high fever, muscle pain and chills. Once the bacteria infects a person's lungs, they may also develop a persistant cough, chest pains and breathing problems. A urine test can detect the disease. Legionnaire's disease is usually caught by breathing in small droplets of contaminated water. It is not contagious and cannot be spread directly from person to person. Legionella bacteria is commonly found in water, including lakes and rivers, though is often in harmlessly low numbers. However, the bacteria can multiply if they find their way into artifical water supplies, including air conditioning systems. Legionnaire's disease is commonly treated with a course of antibiotics. The condition can be particularly serious in people with pre-existing health problems. Most people make a full recovery, but in some cases it can lead to further life-threatening complications. The disease can cause your lungs and kidneys to stop working properly. Another complication is septic shock, which is the result of a blood infection causing a sudden drop in blood pressure. Between 10 and 15 per cent of otherwise healthy people who contract Legionnaire's disease will die due to problems as a result of the condition. In 2010 there were 38 deaths from Legionnaire's disease in England and Wales. Source: NHS Choices . 'Birthing pools in hospitals are subject to stringent infection control procedures and monitoring. 'Home birthing pools filled during labour come with disposable liners and are only in place for a relatively short time period, reducing opportunity for bacterial growth. 'Any women with concerns about using home birthing pools should contact their midwife or local maternity unit.' Legionnaires’ disease is extremely rare in children, with only one case in youngsters aged up to nine in England between 1990 and 2011. Although there were two cases reported in Italy and Japan several years ago, it is the first reported case of Legionnaires’ disease linked to a birthing pool in England. Patients become infected with the bacteria through inhalation of contaminated water droplets. The infection does not spread from person to person. The disease is a severe form of pneumonia which affects around 350 to 400 people each year in England and Wales. The majority of cases involve older patients. NHS information about the condition says that most people make a full recovery but 'in some cases it can lead to further, life-threatening, problems'. Midwives and every local authority in the country are being contacted to see if they use the specific pools provided by any of the companies that supply them. If the pools are currently out for use, councils and midwives should take steps to get them back, a PHE spokeswoman said. The spokeswoman declined to give any further information about the sick baby, including when and where it was born and its sex. The NHS patient safety alert described the child as 'severely ill'. The company that supplied the pool involved has not been named. Microbiologists and nursing bosses today moved to reassure expectant mothers that this is an 'extremely rare' case. Carmel Bagness, Midwifery and Women's Health Adviser at the RCN said it is right that the precautions taken by Public Health England and NHS England were enforced. She said the warnings apply only to a specific type of birthing pool. She said: 'This is a highly unusual situation, and it is right that the proper precautions are taken, but women should be reassured that this alert does not apply to home pools which are filled at the time of labour, or fixed pools in NHS units, which do not pose the same risk. 'Any woman or partner concerned about this alert should contact their midwife or maternity unit for further information.' Professor Nigel Brown, President, Society for General Microbiology, said: 'Legionnaires' disease is often caused by inhaling water droplets containing the bacterium Legionella, which can reproduce in warm water systems. Experts are carrying out more tests to establish if the strain of legionella bacteria which infected the baby was the same as that found in the birthing pool. File picture . 'It is a particularly serious illness in the elderly and immunocompromised individuals, including young infants. 'Legionella is common in the environment and one of the reasons why air conditioning systems have to be regularly serviced to remove bacterial build-up.' Prof Mark Fielder, Professor in Medical Microbiology, Kingston University, said: 'The recent report of a baby being treated in intensive care following the diagnosis of Legionnaires’ disease is an unfortunate and very rare occurrence. 'The case has been reported by Public Health England they have already advised against a specific type of birthing pool with built in heaters and recirculation pumps. 'The specific type of pool implicated can be filled in advance of labour and the temperature is maintained by the heater and pump. 'Birthing pools that are filled from domestic hot water systems at the time of labour do not appear to possess the same risk factors and are not included under the current exclusion. 'This single case does represent a rare occurrence, indeed this is the first case reported in England from a birthing pool (there were two other cases reported internationally in past years, one in Italy in 1999). 'The infection is caused by a bacterium called Legionella pneumophilia which can be found commonly in water sources and at low levels it is harmless. 'The organism can be controlled effectively if the water is cooled to below 20˚C or heated to above 60˚C. 'This type of treatment coupled with general good hygiene in terms of keeping water free of impurities will help to keep the organism under control.'","Legionnaire's disease is a serious lung infection, though is not contagious .

"By . Sarah Griffiths . For young singer Cassie Graves it takes more than just an extra strong mint or a stick of chewing gum to freshen her breath. The 22-year-old has been forced to change her diet after being diagnosed with a rare but debilitating condition - fish odour syndrome. The smell can be so strong it can engulf a room and the condition has left the singer eliminating certain foods in a bid to stem the stench. Ms Graves suffers from Trimethylaminuria, a rare metabolic disorder where the body cannot break down trimethylamine, which is found in certain foods. Cassie Graves, 22, (pictured) suffers from Trimethylaminuria, or fish odour syndrome, which is a rare metabolic disorder where the body can't break down trimethylamine which is found in certain foods. The result is that she can make a room smell of rotting fish . The . disorder causes the chemical to build up in her system before it is . released in her sweat, urine and breath - giving off a strong fishy . odour. Ms . Graves, from South London, said: ‘You know when you go to the food . market and there’s rotting fish? That’s what I smell like. ‘The . whiff comes out from my skin and hair. I sweat it out and it doesn’t . matter how many showers I take, I just can’t get rid of it. ‘There . were times when I smelt so badly of fish that my mum wouldn’t let me go . to school because she didn’t want me to be bullied by the other kids. ‘And it’s hardly ideal to have to go on stage and give a performance when you stink of fish!’ She is unable to smell her own odour and has to rely on friends and family to tell her. ‘The fact that I can’t sniff it out myself is the most frustrating thing about the disorder. It makes you paranoid,’ she said. Ms Graves's unpleasant smell was first noticeable when she was three years old, her sister first picking up on it. ‘I used to share my bedroom with my sister and she started complaining about how much I stank of fish,’ Ms Graves said. ‘My . mum presumed she was just being the standard grumpy older sibling and . ignored her. However gradually, the smell became so strong that no-one . could deny it.’ She . saw several doctors but none could explain the reason for her fishy . odour. It was only after Ms Graves’ mother listened to a radio show . about someone with fish odour syndrome, that she was finally diagnosed . with the condition. Ms Graves (pictured now, left and as a child, right) said it . is not ideal to have to go on stage and give a performance when you . stink of fish. She is unable to smell her own odour. Ms Graves' condition became noticeable when she was three and her mother worried . she might be bullied at school because of it . 'I used to share my bedroom with my sister and she started complaining about how much I stank of fish,' Ms Graves said. 'My mum presumed she was just being the standard grumpy older sibling and ignored her. However gradually, the smell became so strong that no-one could deny it' Trimethylaminuria is an uncommon genetic disorder that causes a strong body odour usually described as like rotting fish, faeces or rubbish. The smell is created when the body is not able to break down trimethylamine - a smelly chemical that is produced in the gut - particularly when protein and choline-rich foods are digested, such as meat and eggs. The chemical trimethylamine builds up the body and sufferers of the condition give off a strong odour in their sweat, urine and breath. Usually the smell first becomes apparent in childhood when children first eat food responsible for the odour. Sometimes the disorder is temporary. Typically people with the disorder typically avoid eggs, dark green vegetables such as broccoli and peas, beans, seafood and oily fish. Low doses of antibiotics can suppress the production of trimethylamine in the short term and supplements can help, but lifestyle changes are mostly used to treat trimethylaminuria. Ms . Graves began to identify the foods that were directly causing her smell . and as a result she has cut out fish, meat and dark green leafy . vegetables out of her diet. ‘Eliminating those foods was devastating. As a child, fish fingers were my favourite food,' said Ms Graves. ‘Over the years, I’ve tried to re-introduce small amounts of fish into my diet again to see if I had grown out of it. But each time, I wake up the next morning and my whole bedroom reeks of fish.’ The singer-songwriter says that living with Trimethylaminuria is a daily struggle. ‘Even now, . it’s hard explaining to others that I have fish odour syndrome,' she added. It’s so . rare that people don’t believe you when you say you have it. ‘At . gigs, I feel like a right diva asking that they don’t serve certain . food. 'Reputation is everything in the music business and I don’t want . people regarding me as ungrateful. I know I’m not Mariah Carey!’ One person who is supportive of Ms Graves’s disorder is her boyfriend, Dom Oliver, a 21-year-old student. ‘I’m so fortunate that Dom is cool about the smell and doesn’t find me gross,’ she said. The condition causes the chemical to build up in Ms Graves' system before it is released in her sweat, urine and breath - giving off a strong fishy odour. She is pictured here with a plate of the food she enjoys eating, but has to steer clear of . ‘He . helps me with my restricted diet. We also have a pact that if I stink . of fish in the morning, he’ll tell me immediately and try not to laugh. ‘I’m . lucky I’ve found a boy who has a sense of humour about it. Dom’s family . have accepted me with it too - in fact, his dad often make jokes about . me smelling!’ However, Ms Graves admits that her condition has led to some embarrassing moments during their relationship. ‘For Valentine’s Day, Dom treated me to a lovely meal at a posh restaurant. I was swept away by the whole occasion and stupidly, I thought I’d treat myself and try some seafood,' she said. 'There . were times when I smelt so badly of fish that my mum wouldn’t let me go . to school because she didn’t want me to be bullied by the other kids' - Cassie Graves . ‘Later during that evening, I absolutely stank of fish - not romantic at all.’ Ms Graves, who is currently working on her first solo album ‘Unpunished’, wants to educate more people about the disorder. ‘I’ve got to a point where I don’t want to hide it anymore. It’s a tricky thing to admit that “Yeah, I stink” but at the end of the day, there are worse things in life than smelling of fish,’ she said. ‘Fellow sufferers need to be more open and talk about their experiences.’ Dr Robin Lachmann, a consultant in Metabolic Medicine at University College Hospital in London, said: ‘Trimethylaminuria is still very much under-recognised and a lot of doctors aren’t aware of the condition. ‘As a result, it takes a long time for patients to be referred to a specialist and diagnosed. ‘Treatment is a diet low in trimethylamine, which is found in fish and choline, which is found in foods like red meat and eggs.’","Cassie Graves, 22, suffers from Trimethylaminuria, or fish odour syndrome .

"By . John Stevens . Speaking out: Dr Charles Alessi said doctors treat patients as 'conditions rather than people' Many older patients’ lives are becoming a misery because they are being prescribed up to 18 tablets a day for different illnesses, a senior government health adviser has warned. Dr Charles Alessi said modern medicine treats patients as ‘conditions rather than people’ and urged doctors to stop practising ‘medicine by body part’ which leads to the over-prescribing of many drugs. But he also said that older patients needed to be more resilient and take control of their illnesses by leading more pro-active lives. Speaking at charity Age UK’s For Later . Life conference, Dr Alessi, who is lead adviser for preventable . dementia in Public Health England, said: ‘Lots of medicine is starting . to lose its way. It’s become far more reductionist – we practise . medicine by body part. ‘We . end up treating conditions on their own. 'So somebody with diabetes and . dementia, who has had a stroke, has a mixture of 12, 15 or 18 drugs to . take in a day and it is very difficult to do that.’ And he said many give up on the pills anyway because they are so fed up with it dominating their lives. He . said: ‘Most people who are put on medication for long-term conditions . are very rarely on the same medication a year later because they have . stopped taking them, because every normal person would if they’re on 18 . drugs a day, because there is very little time to do anything else.’ Almost . half of over-65s have three chronic health problems, such as high blood . pressure, diabetes, and arthritis, leading to many taking an array of . drugs every day and having to cope with the side-effects. Dr . Alessi, who is also chairman of the National Association of Primary . Care, said there was a need for a ‘personalisation of medicine’ in which . doctors would discuss a patient’s priorities with them. But . he also said that older patients must act too and take charge of their . illnesses by finding support from someone who ‘loves you’. High numbers: Dr Alessi said some elderly people are on 'a mixture of 12, 15 or 18 drugs a day' He said: ‘We need to give control back to people and we give control back to people by increasing their resilience. ‘The steps to do that are remarkably simple: be active, connect with people. 'Somebody loves you somewhere, you must belong somewhere, look around you, connect with people around you. ‘Try to learn something every day; try to help somebody else around you and be aware of your surroundings. That’s all you need to do. That activates you.’ Earlier this year Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt called for NHS patients to be ‘treated as people’. Since April, doctors’ practices have had to assign every patient aged 75 or over a named, accountable GP.","Health adviser say elderly are fed up with pills dominating their lives .

"By . Simon Peach, Press Association . Olympic and Commonwealth gold medallist Greg Rutherford can now add European long jump champion to his impressive list of honours. Two years on from the high of his London triumph on 'Super Saturday', the 27-year-old has enjoyed quite a time of late. Earlier this year Rutherford revealed that his girlfriend Susie Verrill is expecting their first child in the same week he was named British record holder, having jumped 8.51 metres in Chula Vista, San Diego in April. Success: Greg Rutherford wins long jump gold at the European Championships . He overcame injury to triumph at Hampden Park a fortnight ago and secured his place at the top of the long jump podium in Zurich with an impressive leap of 8.29m - 14 centimetres ahead of nearest rival Louis Tsatoumas of Greece. Given some have suggested Rutherford was lucky to win the Olympics with an 8.31m jump, he was particularly pleased to quieten such naysayers with another gold medal. 'I'm the biggest fluke going,' he said with a smile. 'I keep doing this. It's fantastic. 'It's great to go out there and put out a couple of half decent jumps and have another title. I only took four today. 'I had the luxury of four rounds and leaving it. I had a slight tightening after the fourth and thought I'd wait and see if someone could jump further.' Medals: The 27-year-old has also won gold at the Olympic and Commonwealth games . Rutherford was one of three Brits in the long jump final, with JJ Jegede finishing ninth with a best of 7.88m and Chris Tomlinson ending 11th after a 7.75m effort. Rutherford came to fame in 2012 when he won gold in the long jump at the London Olympics and has since gone on to extend his list of achievements at the Commonwealth Games.

Golden: Gemili, Ashleigh Nelson, Richard Kilty, James Ellington, Asha Phillip, Harry Aikines-Aryeetey, Jodie Williams and Desiree Henry of Great Britain pictured after winning gold in the Mens and Womens 4x100m relay . Victorious: Adam Gemili crosses the line as Great Britain win gold in the 4x100m relay in Zurich . While the relay runners were doing their thing, Farah was celebrating adding the 5000m title to his 10,000m one. 'It was amazing to have my family here and to have my kids on the track with me, kissing me and saying 'daddy won',' Farah said. 'It's the first time my young twins have properly watched me race so it's great. History's very important to me and I always hope to make my country proud. 'There's been some down times but two golds here is great and now I hope to get ready to face the big guys next year at the IAAF World Championships. 'What I've achieved over the years means that the rest of the field let me do my thing. The race went well, I went to the front so it was good. My distance double's great for my country and thanks to everyone's support over the years.' Done it: Gemili reacts in delight as he continues what was a fantastic day for Great Britain in Zurich . British team-mate Vernon had hoped to dash Farah's long-distance double, but could only add bronze to his 10,000m silver. 'I feel I almost missed out in the 10,000m when I got silver, so I came into this thinking I won't let that happen again,' he told the BBC. 'I had a plan to win the gold but it got to the last 800m and the wheels slowly started to come off. I was surprised I held on for bronze in the end. 'But to get two medals is brilliant. I wish one of them could have been gold but when you are racing against the best you have to accept a silver and a bronze is good.'","Adam Gemili led the men home on the final day of European Championships .

"By . Rob Draper for The Mail on Sunday . Follow @@draper_rob . Jose Mourinho says that his team finally has the balls to win the title and that the new signings he has brought to the club will add to the character of the team, which was found wanting last season. Mourinho famously accused his side of lacking the right mentality to win the title when they slipped up losing 1-0 at Crystal Palace in the title run-in last March – refusing to say the words but writing ‘balls’ down on a notepad when asked what his side were missing. But now with the addition of some key players in Diego Costa, Thibaut Courtois, Cesc Fabregas, Filipe Luis and returnee Didier Drogba, Mourinho says that his team will have the right attitude travelling to venues like Turf Moor on Monday to meet newly-promoted Burnley . Balls: Cesc Fabregas and Diego Costa are 'men' says Jose Mourinho, and will help win Chelsea the league . And it is the likes of Costa, who famously squared up to John Terry and then argued with a number of Chelsea players in the Champions League semi-final when playing for Atletico, and Courtois, the goalkeeper whose outstanding display in the same game helped defeat Chelsea, in whom Mourinho seems to place his confidence. ‘I have met so many wonderful characters in football but it is difficult to find one better than Diego Costa,’ said Mourinho. ‘In the group, in the club, he’s so nice, so funny. He’s the kind of guy who at this moment probably knows ten words in English, but he speaks with everybody. I don’t know in which language, I don’t know how, but he understands everybody and everybody understands him. ‘They are laughing all the time and he is an amazing, positive guy in the group. After that, when he goes to the pitch, he wants to win matches and the fact that he played against Chelsea, a club that he was already connected to, as people were having the feeling he could come to us, and play against us and play the way he did for his club shows his character, as well as the goalkeeper (Courtois), who was the Chelsea goalkeeper (on loan to Atletico) and he played against us and he killed us. Opponent: Diego Costa caused quite a stir when playing for Ateltico against Chelsea lasts season . ‘The group is different. Costa is a man, Fabregas is a man. It’s not about individuals, it’s about the team profile. Chelsea last season were closer to winning the title than the season before. Then (2012-13) they finished third but only in the last game of the season. Before that, fifth, 20 points behind. ‘If you generate in the team the feeling that you are not ready to compete for the title, you don’t have that habit of playing every game for every point. You lose qualities. In the last years, Chelsea became a good team in knockouts, in Cup and European competitions and so on. In terms of competitive marathons, being strong every week, every game, fighting in every condition, at home, away, in rain, cold, in hot sun, I found a team that lost the ingredients you need to be champions. Last season, step by step, we recovered these. Some boys, like Eden Hazard, Oscar, for them it was something new to go in that direction. This season they are much more prepared.’ Friendly: Diego Costa's lack of English has done nothing to dampen his spirits, says Mourinho . At £32m, Costa is the marquee signing and despite a disappointing World Cup with Spain, the striker, who was born and raised in the remote town of Lagarto in north-east Brazil, remains one of the most exciting additions to the Premier League after his 35 goals at Atletico Madrid last season as they won the league and reached the Champions League final. Having been part-owned by a business group, the 25-year-old took his time to make it to the top, having been brought to Braga in Portugal in 2006 before joining Atletico but then being loaned to Celta Vigo, Albacete, Real Valladolid and Rayo Vallecano and only becoming a regular at Atletico two seasons ago. Mourinho believes he is now ready to become one of the dominant stars of the Premier League. ‘He can be. I know he can be,’ said Mourinho. ‘He’s on that level (of the best players I have ever had). He was in Portugal at the age of 18 and I never look at him. So everybody was blind, including me. Matured: After numerous loan spells Costa finally matured, which led to his Chelsea transfer . ‘He went to Atletico and Sergio Aguero was the superstar and he went on loan. After Aguero was gone, they brought Radamel Falcao, who was the superstar and he was on loan. I think he was always behind very important players but at the same time he was developing himself so that when he got the chance to go back to Atletico he was even better than the previous ones. ‘He’s still the guy that comes from a very small village, somewhere over the horizon. It’s the kind of place that is difficult to find. He’s still that guy. The way he behaves, the way he acts, the way he interacts, he’s still that naïve, pure, simple, humble guy. At the same time, he’s such a communicator, such a good group guy, such a happy man. He can establish a conversation and interact with somebody and he doesn’t understand anything the other person is saying. But just because of his gestures and body language and his happiness, everybody likes the guy so much. ‘Every time I say to him: “Do you need me to explain something in Portguese?” And he’s just: “No! I understand everything.” And I think in terms of the football, he does. In meetings, and when we watch videos, and my comments, I think the guy goes in the direction I want him to go. He’s a clever guy.’ Change: Mourinho said that his team did not always have the right attitude last season .","Jose Mourinho says his latest signings have improved Chelsea's attitude .

"By . Press Association Reporter . Co-chairmen David Sullivan and David Gold have urged West Ham supporters to avoid any unwanted behaviour when they start their Barclays Premier League campaign at home to fierce rivals Tottenham on Saturday. With the club having come under scrutiny in the past - anti-Semitic chanting and hisses have been heard, allegedly replicating gas chambers used during the Holocaust - the spotlight could again shift away from the on-field action. But Sullivan and Gold, writing a message to fans on the club’s official website, are keen to avoid any further incidents which would portray West Ham in a bad light. VIDEO Scroll down to watch  Allardyce and  Pochettino talk ahead of the derby . London affair: West Ham play host to north London outfit Tottenham on Saturday afternoon . Fierce encounter: Both sides will be looking to claim all three points in their opening match of the season . The statement read: 'West Ham United would like to thank all supporters who have purchased a ticket for Saturday’s season opening London derby with Tottenham Hotspur. 'The Hammers enjoyed three memorable wins against Spurs last season, with the resultant press coverage of each game rightly focusing on the action on the pitch three outstanding performances from the team. 'Saturday’s game is likely to be an immensely passionate affair and, as ever, we know both sets of fans will be providing plenty of vocal support for their team. 'However, West Ham United seeks to remind all home fans attending the match at the Boleyn Ground that they will be acting as ambassadors for West Ham United and their behaviour should reflect the values and standards of our club. 'We are proud to support causes that promote tolerance and inclusion and tackle discrimination in whatever form it takes. 'Therefore, any inappropriate behaviour is completely unacceptable and will not be tolerated by the club. 'Working with the Metropolitan Police, the club will continue to adopt a zero tolerance policy towards any form of discriminatory behaviour and any fan found to be acting inappropriately - including racist, anti-Semitic and homophobic behaviour - will be punished to the full extent of the law and banned from attending matches. 'Everyone at West Ham United is looking forward to the first game of the new season at the Boleyn Ground, where the famous Claret and Blue Army can show the world what being a Hammers fan is all about - supporting with pride, passion and respect.' Wise words: Owners David Sullivan (left) and David Gold (right) have called for calm ahead of the game . Tottenham also moved to stress the need for proper conduct from their travelling supporters.

'All of our supporters travelling to Upton Park are doing so as ambassadors of the club and we would ask that they behave in a manner of which we can be proud. 'The club does not tolerate discrimination of any sort, on the pitch or in the stands, and we shall also take appropriate action against anyone heard using abusive, offensive or obscene language. 'Our fans generate a fantastic, positive atmosphere both at the Lane and on our travels and we hope everyone continues to focus their energies on cheering the team on.'","The Hammers host London rivals Tottenham on Saturday afternoon .

"By . Phil Blanche, Press Association Sport . Wales manager Chris Coleman insists Real Madrid are happy for Gareth Bale to play on Andorra's 3G pitch should FIFA give the controversial surface the all-clear for their Euro 2016 opener. Coleman spent last weekend in Madrid where he saw two games and met up with Real boss Carlo Ancelotti and his star man Bale. Top of the agenda was the playing surface at Andorra's rebuilt 3,300 capacity national stadium where Wales will kick-off their Euro campaign on September 9 - if it passes a FIFA inspection on Friday. No problem: Real Madrid will allow Gareth Bale to play for Wales on Andorra's artificial pitch . Boost: Wales boss Chris Coleman will be able to call on Bale for his first Euro 2016 qualifier next month . Hennessey (Crystal Palace), Letheren (Dundee), Fon Williams (Tranmere), Chester (Hull), Collins (West Ham), Davies (Tottenham), Gunter (Reading), Matthews (Celtic), Ricketts (Wolves), Taylor (Swansea), Williams (capt, Swansea), Allen (Liverpool), Huws (Manchester City, loan Wigan), King (Leicester), Ledley (Crystal Palace), Ramsey (Arsenal), Vaughan (Nottingham Forest), Bale (Real Madrid), Church (Charlton), Lawrence (Manchester United), Robson-Kanu (Reading), G Williams (Fulham), J Williams (Crystal Palace). The new surface will be subjected to laboratory and field tests, determining how the surface reacts to players' skin when sliding, how the ball rolls and bounces on the turf and how it absorbs the shock of a player hitting the floor when falling. Coleman said Ancelotti has experience of his teams playing on artificial surfaces and was quick to point out the dangers, but the Wales boss is adamant that Bale will be available for the opening game in Group B. 'Ideally we'd be on the grass as we're not used to playing on a 3G pitch,' Coleman said after naming a 23-man squad which includes talented youngsters Tom Lawrence and George Williams, but is without veteran centre-back Danny Gabbidon, now without a club following his summer release by Crystal Palace. 'I was speaking to Carlo and he said when Madrid played on 3G pitch against weaker opposition the players struggled because they didn't like the surface. 'My message to our players is 'forget where we're playing'. We've got to get a result and whatever the surface we've got to get through it and do our job. 'If Fifa say we're not going to play on that pitch and we're going to play on the grass, we'll play on the grass. 'But if they say we've got to play on 3G, we'll play on 3G - and get a result. That's how it is.' Wise words: Real Madrid manager Carlo Ancelotti has spoken to Coleman about playing on artificial pitches . Should FIFA veto the use of Andorra's national stadium, the game could be switched to Barcelona some three hours away - possibly at Espanyol's Estadi Cornella-El Prat. But Coleman insisted that Bale would travel to Andorra if the game there gets the go-ahead, despite acknowledging that some players have had bad reactions to playing on 3G surfaces. 'Madrid understand Gareth's got a job to play for Wales, if he's available he's going to play,' said Coleman, stressing that his squad would not train on the surface beforehand for fear of picking up injuries. 'Carlo said when they trained on 3G a lot of players had bad reactions, it was tough. 'Some of our players have also trained on a 3G pitch and the reaction a day or two after is not good. 'They're not used to it and we have looked at that and most coaches at our level would not like to play on a 3G pitch. 'It was a bit of a surprise the games were sanctioned so we've simply said can it be looked at and that's what's happened.' Superstar: Bale, pictured here in action against Cordoba in La Liga, will be hoping to fire Wales to Euro 2016 . Coleman was also asked whether he would name Ched Evans in his Welsh squad when the Sheffield United striker is released from prison in October. Evans was convicted of rape and sentenced to five years in prison in April 2012 and news of his imminent release sparked an online petition with over 60,000 people saying he should be prevented from resuming his football career. 'I've not yet had that conversation with anybody at the Football Association of Wales,' Coleman said. 'It's not a five-minute conversation, that's a serious and long conversation before we make any decision. 'I've never met Ched and I can't comment on him but I wouldn't imagine it's going to be easy for him to find himself at the level where he was before. 'But it's up to myself and the FAW to have a conversation about it because it's such a serious matter.'","Wales will face Andorra in their first Euro 2016 qualifier on September 9 .
