Women who smoke in pregnancy could be putting their children at greater risk of being fat as teenagers, warn researchers. They fear that smoking leads to subtle structural variations in the growing brain of the unborn baby that create a preference for eating fatty foods. Smoking during pregnancy is already linked to low birthweight and premature delivery of the baby, but evidence is now emerging of the way in which it affects the child's health in the long-term. Dr Amirreza Haghighi, of the Hospital . for Sick Children, Toronto, Canada, who led a new study, said 'Prenatal . exposure to maternal cigarette smoking is a well-established risk . factor for obesity, but the underlying mechanisms are not known. 'Preference for fatty foods, regulated in part by the brain reward system, may contribute to the development of obesity.' The research comes as experts predict two out of three children could be obese by 2050 if current trends continue. More than one in five is obese at present - so fat it threatens their health. The study recruited 378 adolescents age 13 to 19 years of which almost half had mothers who smoked during pregnancy. They were carefully matched with the remaining participants whose mothers didn't. Maternal smoking was defined as having a mother who smoked more than one cigarette a day during the second trimester of pregnancy, while the mothers of the remainder did not smoke one year before or during the pregnancy. Babies born to women who smoked weighed less at birth and were breastfed for shorter periods of time. The . researchers found the teenagers whose mothers smoked had a marginally . higher body weight and Body Mass Index (BMI), a measure of weight . related to height. They also had significantly higher total body fat . compared with adolescents whose mothers did not smoke in pregnancy. The other significant difference was noted by researchers on brain scans.They . found teens whose mothers smoked while they were in the womb had a . lower volume of the region called the amygdala, which plays a role in . processing emotions and storing memories. This . part of the brain also appears to have a role in limiting fat intake, . and the researchers found that as amygdala volume fell, fat intake went . up. Teenagers may find it harder to resist sweet and fatty foods if their mothers smoked when pregnant with them (file picture) 'Prenatal exposure to maternal cigarette smoking may promote obesity by enhancing dietary preference for fat, and this effect may be mediated in part through subtle structural variations in the amygdala' say the researchers in a report published Online First in the Archives of General Psychiatry journal. Latest figures show 13.4 per cent of women smoked in pregnancy in England last year, down from 15 per cent on 2006-07. Cutting smoking during pregnancy is one of three national aims in the government's tobacco control plan, published in March last year. The aim is to have cut the number of women smoking at the time of giving birth to no more than 11 per cent by the end of 2015. Dr David Haslam, chairman of the UK's National Obesity Forum, said it was clear that a mother's dietary and other choices in pregnancy could 'switch on' bad genes. He said 'We're seeing the results of the new science of epigenetics in which genes can express proteins, or become activated, by what happens in pregnancy. 'Everyone knows that smoking is bad for you, and we've seen clear evidence of the health risks over the last 50 years. 'But now there are even more reasons for a pregnant woman to avoid smoking, and press home the message that obesity begins in the womb. 'You can give your child the best start in life and help them avoid obesity at the same time' he added.","Smoking may lead to subtle structural variations in the growing brain of the unborn baby .

A terminally ill woman who was granted the right to die after a court battle with her own parents has had a last-minute change of heart. Grace Sung Eun Lee today signed a document allowing her deeply religious father to make all decisions about her healthcare. He is certain to keep her on life support for as long as possible, as he believes that if she removes her breathing tube she will have committed suicide, which he regards as a sin. Bitter battle: Grace Sung Eun Lee, centre, is on breathing tubes following a seizure from a brain tumour, but her parents will not allow her to be removed from the tubes . Ms Lee, a 28-year-old former bank manager from New York, said the decision would allow her 'to make peace with my God'. It was only yesterday that she won . the right to take control of her own healthcare after a court declared . that she was competent to make decisions. But 24 hours later, she signed over her decision-making abilities to her father, Rev. Manho Lee, according to WABC-TV. Ms Lee had told her parents and the doctors: ‘I want to die.’ But . because her parents are deeply religious and belong to a Korean . Christian church in Queens, they believe that allowing her daughter to . choose death over life is a sin. A judge at the state appeals court yesterday sided with Ms Lee after the rift with her parents led to an agonising legal battle for the family. Devastated: Miss Lee's parents are pictured at the hospital after hearing the news that she has won the right to die . Happier times: Grace, centre, pictured with her parents Manho Lee, left, and Jin-ah Lee, right; her father is a pastor at a Flushing, Queens church . Speaking with the New York Daily News, Ms Lee’s mother, Jin-ah Lee, said: ‘Despite all this confusion, (my daughter) wants to go to heaven. I keep telling her she can get better.’ Her daughter is currently at Long Island North Shore Hospital, hooked up to breathing tubes that are keeping her alive. She is paralysed from the neck down due to the tumour on her brain stem. Ms Lee’s father is Antioch Missionary Church reverend Manho Lee, and practices out of his church in the Flushing neighbourhood of Queens. His congregation has flocked behind him to pray for Ms Lee and tell her of God's plans for her life. The sin of suicide, they said, would condemn their daughter's soul to hell. The difference in beliefs has led to an emergency end-of-life hearing at the hospital, with the two sides bitterly re-affirming their respective stances. Smiling: Ms Lee had worked as a manager at Bank of America and lived in Manhattan . Meeting: On October 1, there was a press conference at North Shore Hospital to inform the media of Grace's condition . Speaking on behalf of Ms Lee, Dr Dana Lustbader testified that the patient ‘consistently asks that her breathing tube be removed.’ However, Rev Lee and his wife argued that their daughter is heavily medicated, and is not lucid enough to make the life-or-death decision. Doctors said that her medications, including morphine and an anti-anxiety medication, are not strong enough to cloud her judgment. Ms Lee’s troubles began last year. Before her illness, she worked as a manager for Bank of America, living and working in Manhattan. She was also training for the famous New York City marathon. She had emigrated with her parents from Seoul, South Korea, the Daily News reported. But Ms Lee was devastated when she was diagnosed with a tumour in her brain stem. Though she received chemotherapy and radiation, the treatments did not successfully target the tumour, and last month, she had a seizure that eventually left her paralysed. Ms Lee had apparently talked to nurses at North Shore about removing the tubes, but her parents interceded. Offering support: Members of the congregation in Ms Lee's room, praying for her to be healed . Full of life: Grace Sung Eun Lee pictured before her illness . A Facebook page entitled Save Grace SungEun Lee cites a passage from the Old Testament, which reads: ‘”For I know the plans I have for you,” declares the Lord. “Plans to prosper you and not to harm you, plans to give you hope and a future.”’ A post from Tuesday reads: ‘We can see God’s powers working every day and know that God has a plan for her too!’ Children from the congregation have written notes of encouragement for the 28-year-old, with one writing: ‘I hope you feel better. I miss you, Grace Teacher.’ Cultural, as well as religious differences have come to play in Ms Lee’s case. Rev Young Gab Hyun said: ‘In Korean culture... we believe that the decisions that the parents make have a lot more influence in this type of matter.’ Words of love: Young members of the church offered kind words to Ms Lee, calling her 'Grace Teacher,' and pleading with her to come back soon . ‘The role of religion in medial decision making really pertains to the patient,’ Tia Powell, M.D., the director of Montefiore Einstein Center for Bioethics, told MailOnline. ‘If the patient is capable of making her decisions, then that’s where we would honour.’ Dr Powell added that while it may be heart-wrenching for the parents to face, she said the goal of bioethics is to bring the families together. ‘The question is not whether she’s going to die, it’s how she’s going to die. ‘There’s nothing worse than losing a child,’ she said, ‘but there are limits to medical treatment. There are many things we cannot fix, we cannot perform miracles.’ Dr Powell said that there are some practices that could help Ms Lee’s parents come to terms with their daughter’s illness. ‘These are religious people, and they know we are all mortal,’ she said. ‘Being clear about that can maybe help decrease their suffering.’","Grace Sung Eun Lee, 28, is paralysed from neck down due to brain tumour .

Appalling: Darren Leggett's 'catalogue' of paedophile abuse was branded 'about as depressing as it's possible to be' A supermarket worker who was also the leader of an international paedophile ring raped children as young as five before trading videos of the horrific abuse online, a court heard today. Darren Leggett, 32, raped his three victims - all aged under 13 - then made 36 harrowing films of the sickening abuse for others to see. The paedophile's six-year campaign of abuse saw him create his own websites from his parents' house, which itself was just a short walk from a local primary school. Leggett, branded simply 'wrong' by a judge, gave the clips disgusting titles and included one where he made horrendous boasts about having sex with a boy who did not know he was being filmed. The sex offender was today jailed indefinitely, although his tariff will be a minimum of seven years. Maidstone . Crown Court heard the quiet supermarket employee first came across the . youngsters in the aisles of the store where he worked, then later gained . access to the children. Leggett’s six-year campaign of abuse was only uncovered when a boy he abused told a teacher what had been happening to him. The Internet Watch Foundation received an anonymous tip-off which then alerted child exploitation experts. Undercover . police launched an online sting - dubbed Operation Cake - and Leggett, . calling himself Ben, was caught after he contacted an officer, posing as . 'JJ', and told him he was interested in having sex with children. The court heard he had previously written depraved text messages boasting of his plans to 'rape and kill kids'. Judge . Philip Statman, jailing Leggett, said the paedophile's attitude to . children was abundantly clear on a websites where he stated: 'We are not . sickos, we just like children more than adult women or men. It is not . wrong to like who you are. You are who you are.' The judge told him: 'You have a distorted thought-pattern that leads to the view that sexual activity is a way of loving your victims. You are wrong.' The judge said he had given anxious consideration as to whether he should impose a life sentence, but was just persuaded he should not. He said: 'However, I am satisfied you represent a significant risk of committing further specified offences. Dangerousness is well and truly passed in the terms of the test in your case.' Jailed: Leggett was given an indefinite prison term at Maidstone Crown Court, but will serve a minimum of seven years . Leggett, of Yalding, Kent, was convicted at Maidstone Crown Court on May 11 after pleading guilty to 31 offences including rape, sexual assault, arranging a child for a sexual offence, and for possessing and distributing indecent images of children. Police uncovered the full extent of sexual abuse following a raid at his home, where a rucksack containing cannabis equipment, cable ties, a knife and 13 pairs of boys pants was also seized. The sex pest despicably joked as he was handcuffed claiming he preferred 'pink fluffy ones'. Crispian Cartwright, defending, described the offending as 'an absolutely lamentable catalogue and about as depressing to read as anything can be'. He added: 'This is a man who through his own admission showed he was a paedophile. He faced up to it. He has the terrible misfortune to be cursed with paedophilia.' Leggett will remain on the sex offenders’ register for life and be banned from working with children or vulnerable adults. A sexual offences prevention order was imposed, also for life.","Darren Leggett's rape victims were all under 13 .

Small change: Christoffel Hendrik Wiese, worth £3billion, claims carrying large sums of cash is not unusual . A South African billionaire says he should not have been treated with suspicion for trying to board a plane with nearly £700,000 in cash - because that amount of money is peanuts to him. Customs Officers seized £674,920 from Dr Christoffel Hendrik Wiese at London City Airport in 2009 and a judge later ordered the money be forfeited as 'the proceeds of criminal activity'. But Dr Wiese, who is South Africa's third-richest man, has launched a High Court bid to claw back the cash, citing his entirely clean criminal record in the UK and abroad. His barrister, Clare Montgomery QC, told the court: 'The amount of money was consistent with Dr Wiese's stated wealth, representing less than two weeks' income and a minute fraction of his assets.' Dr Wiese - worth an estimated £3billion - is the largest single shareholder in Africa's biggest supermarket, Shoprite, as well as having investments in mining and wine companies, according to Forbes. The High Court heard that on April 27, 2009 customs officials found £120,000 in his hand luggage as he went to board a flight to Luxembourg and more than £500,000 in two suitcases he had checked into the hold. Dr Wiese explained the money came from diamond deals in South Africa in the 80s and 90s, and had been kept in a safety deposit box in the Ritz hotel because of foreign exchange restrictions in his homeland, lawyers for the UK Border Agency said. More than £400,000 was in used notes, bundled together with elastic bands, nearly £7,000 was in Scottish currency and around £5,400 was in a 'mutilated' state, the court heard. Suspicions aroused: Customs officials found £120,000 in Dr Wiese's hand luggage as he went to board a flight at London City Airport and more than £500,000 in two suitcases he had checked into the hold, the High Court heard . Dr Wiese told officials he was going to invest the money in Luxembourg and was due to fly back later that same afternoon. However, District Judge Snow, sitting at Westminster Magistrates' Court the following year, ruled the huge value of the cash and the insecure method of transporting it meant the money should be seized as the proceeds of crime. Dr Wiese is now challenging that decision at the High Court, claiming the UK Border Agency had not a shred of evidence linking him to criminal activity, and his enormous wealth meant it was not suspicious for him to be carrying such a large sum in cash. Miss Montgomery told the court: 'Dr Wiese was a man of good character whose wealth could be traced to legitimate and extensive business activities. There was no evidence that he had any criminal associates in the UK or South Africa. 'Dr Wiese told no lies to the Customs Officers. He answered their questions without recourse to legal advice. He assisted in the process of questioning without protest at any point.' The UK Border Agency argue the judge was entitled to make the finding he did on the 'startling' facts of the case and considering Dr Wiese had no documentation backing up his account. Mr Justice Underhill, who will decide whether to quash the ruling and hand back the money, reserved his judgment, which will be given at an unspecified date in the future.","Christoffel Hendrik Wiese wants return of seized stash .

Swipe: Speaker Bercow ordered the Prime Minister to respond to an urgent question from Labour . David Cameron took an extraordinary swipe at Speaker John Bercow tonight after being dragged to the Commons to answer more questions over the Jeremy Hunt affair. The Prime Minister was said to be ‘furious’ at having been made to scrap plans for a local election speech on the economy after Speaker Bercow ordered him to respond to an urgent question from Labour. It is thought to be the first time a Prime Minister has been forced to answer an urgent question since Tony Blair in 2002, over the firefighters’ dispute. In an angry appearance, Mr Cameron insisted Mr Hunt – whose career is hanging in the balance over his dealings with Rupert Murdoch’s media empire – had already answered MPs’ questions in an emergency statement last week, while he had addressed the issue in Prime Minister’s Questions. He restated the position he outlined over the weekend, saying he did not believe the Culture Secretary had broken ministerial rules but opening the door to a Whitehall inquiry or his dismissal if further damaging evidence emerges when he appears at the Leveson inquiry. Number Ten confirmed that Mr Cameron decided not to sack Mr Hunt, for now, without seeing email or text exchanges between him and his special adviser Adam Smith, who resigned last week. Officials said that as both men are appearing as witness at the Leveson inquiry, they are not allowed to share evidence. But they insisted Mr Cameron had sought assurances from Mr Hunt that nothing incriminating was contained in the messages, which will be handed to Lord Leveson. Scroll down for video . Refusing to budge: Cameron staunchly defended Jeremy Hunt's conduct over the BSkyB affair, insisting there was no proof he had breached the ministerial code . Labour . leader Ed Miliband attempted to draw the Prime Minister deeper into . the row surrounding Culture Secretary Jeremy Hunt’s handling of News . Corporation’s bid for BSkyB. A defiant David Cameron . condemned Mr Miliband for 'trying to use the Leveson Inquiry for party . political purposes'. Mr . Miliband claimed the Culture Secretary had committed three breaches of . the ministerial code but Mr Cameron needed the Cabinet minister to . survive for his own protection. 'The Prime Minister is defending the indefensible and he knows it,' Mr Miliband said. 'Protecting the Culture Secretary's job while up and down the country hundreds of thousands are losing theirs.' Mr Hunt's former special adviser Adam Smith, who quit last week, 'had to go to protect the Culture Secretary', Mr Miliband said. But he added: 'The Culture Secretary has to stay to protect the Prime Minister. On . the attack: Ed Miliband insisted the Prime Minister was keeping Hunt in . a job to deflect attention away from his own relationship with Rupert . Murdoch's empire . 'The Prime Minister has shown today he is incapable of doing his duty: too close to a powerful few, out of touch with everyone else.But Mr Cameron dismissed the attack as 'weak and wrong'. Labour pressed for the issue to be referred to the independent adviser on ministerial interests, Sir Alex Allan. But Mr Cameron insisted that it would be wrong to launch a separate investigation into Mr Hunt's actions unless new evidence emerged from the Leveson Inquiry. He said: 'As was made clear in his . statement last Wednesday, in every respect with regard to the News . Corporation bid, the Culture Secretary asked for independent advice and . acted on it. Smiling in face of adversity: Hunt . 'He was not required to ask or to follow such advice, but he did so. 'He acted fairly and impartially and in line with the advice of his Permanent Secretary. Mr Cameron added: 'I have seen no evidence to suggest that in handling this issue the Secretary of State acted in any way that was contrary to the ministerial code.' Commons Speaker John Bercow approved an urgent question tabled by Labour demanding to know why the issue of Mr Hunt's links to News Corporation has not been handed to independent adviser on ministerial interests, Sir Alex Allan. Downing Street confirmed that the Prime Minister - who had been due to visit Milton Keynes campaigning for local elections - will respond personally in the Commons this afternoon. Hunt managed another blunder yesterday . by showing details of a meeting he was about to enter, dealing with, . among other topics, the bad press coverage over the lengthy queues to . pass border controls at Heathrow. Mr Cameron yesterday offered qualified support to his Cabinet minister, who is facing calls to resign over his handling of the BSkyB deal. The premier insisted he did not currently believe the ministerial code had been broken - although he also hinted that an independent investigation could take place after Mr Hunt has given evidence to the Leveson Inquiry. He also said Mr Hunt's special adviser Adam Smith had been right to resign over 'too close, too frequent' contacts with News Corp lobbyist Frederic Michel. This morning, Labour leader Ed . Miliband sought to broaden the controversy by saying it 'goes to the . character of the Government'. Unbowed: Hunt shows no signs of feeling the mounting pressure for his resignation as he travels to a meeting . 'People need to know, particularly in these times, that they have a Government that stands up for them, not the rich and powerful,' he told a question and answer event in central London. 'People need to know that there is the utmost probity and integrity in the way that Government is run. 'I am afraid the events of the last week suggest that something other than that has been going on.' Mr Miliband went on: 'It is a pattern with this Prime Minister, particularly around News International. He resists the calls for change. He resists the calls to do the right thing. 'Exactly as he did in phone hacking last summer, exactly as he did with Rebekah Brooks, exactly as he did with Andy Coulson. 'He is doing the same now when everyone can see that the obvious thing for him to do is make this referral to Alex Allan. 'That is what he should get on and do rather than seeking to use Jeremy Hunt as a firewall.' Edward Miliband was aghast, appalled, . his eyes two white billiard balls. ‘This,’ he schpluttered, ‘is a . breach of paragraph 1.2 C of the code!’ My goodness. Not paragraph 1.2 C. Smelling salts, Petunia. Someone put in a call to the Tower of London . pronto and see if a firing squad for Jeremy Hunt can be arranged this . very day. You can’t go breaking paragraph 1.2 C . and still expect to belong to a Government, matey, not in this day and . age. Call The Guardian! Pull in the BBC! Warp factor five! Commons Speaker John Bercow . Mr . Miliband, champion Rubik cubist, had discerned an infraction (alleged) of the rules. His media allies were breathing so fast with the shock of . it all, they practically needed a brown paper bag to increase the oxygen . supply. Gather, girls, gather. Labour MPs pulled in their cheeks as though they were attached to the suction duct of a Dyson. Speaker . Bercow, who had awarded possibly the lamest Urgent Question ever . granted in parliamentary history, frowned and cocked his ear. He could have been a great conductor . at an oratorio rehearsal who is certain he has just identified a groaner . in the back row of the tenor line. Paragraph 1.2 C of the code. Well, well. This was going to make the Profumo affair look like a teddy bears’ picnic. Or maybe not. Yesterday’s comically . melodramatic calling to the despatch box of David Cameron was, for its . progenitors, a failure. They had hoped to show the Prime . Minister as some sort of scuttling beetle, shifty, panicked, a . collaborator with the Murdoch regime. They had intended him to emerge from the session wounded, bloodied, black smoke trailing from his starboard engine. None of this happened. Comrades, the . revolutionary  Milibandian-Bercowite plot for world domination has been, . er, postponed. As the Japanese emperor said, things did not necessarily . proceed to our advantage. The devil Cameron, most regrettably, . performed rather brilliantly. He did not just win the narrow encounters . between himself and Mr Miliband. By the end he had the Tory side roaring its support for him. Speaker Bercow, like Muttley the dog, had been foiled! The PM made pretty plain his contempt . for the Squeaker’s decision to haul him to the Commons (he had had . other things planned for the day). He noted that he and Culture Secretary Hunt had answered questions about the matter only on Wednesday. Translation: why on earth this is worthy of Urgent Question status, Gawd only knows. Or as David Davies (Con, Monmouth) was to put it: ‘This is more nakedly opportunistic than you’ll find on . page three of The Sun.’ The closest we got to Tory dissent . was from Julian Lewis (New Forest E), who craftily asked if we were . getting ‘value for money’ from Downing Street’s standards inspector. Dr Lewis put this with just enough drollery to keep Mr Cameron smiling. The Prime Minister was fired up, certainly, even a little tremulous of hand. There was a flash of anger when he told Mr Miliband, ‘If you’re going to make these accusations, get your facts right.’ He said he did ‘not belittle’ the . Hunt business but at the same time simply did not think it matched the . importance of the economy, jobs, the euro’s future and investment. It was ‘bad judgement, rotten politics and plain wrong’ of Mr Miliband to make such a bally-hoo about such recherche concerns. Mr Miliband, for his part, called for Mr Cameron to sack Mr Hunt. It was that paragraph 1.2 C thing, see? Mr Miliband thought that Mr Cameron was over-familiar with a small clique of powerful people. Never! Urgent Questions are sometimes held . as a great weapon in the Opposition’s armoury but recent events suggest . that they backfire when used in too political a way. That happened yesterday. The Tory benches united so strongly . behind Mr Cameron that the PM was left looking stronger, while Mr . Miliband was stranded in the position of an obsessive deriving . frottage-style satisfaction at his Rubik’s Cube.","PM cancels local election campaigning to respond to urgent Commons question tabled by Labour .

David Beckham is to play a last-minute part in the Olympics opening ceremony - a gesture aimed at thanking the footballer for helping to get the Games to London. A 'starring role' is thought to have been created especially for the 37-year-old after he was left out of the GB football squad. Beckham, who had considered boycotting the event, is now said to be in talks with organisers over his precise involvement with Friday's ceremony, which is expected to be watched by a global audience of 4billion. Carrying the torch: David Beckham is said to be 'delighted and excited' about the prospect of playing a key role in the opening ceremony . The former England captain is said to be 'excited and delighted' about the invitation to join the ceremony - particularly as London is his home city, The People reported. An Olympics source told the newspaper: 'David will have a starring role in the Games and he is excited about the prospect. It's going to be a big, big surprise.' The role is said to be in recognition for the footballer's work at the International Olympic Committee vote in 2005, helping London win its bid to host the Games. He was seen lobbying alongside former Prime Minister Tony Blair and Lord Sebastian Coe and was considered to have played a pivotal role during the final days of the campaign trail. However, he was said to have been so . disappointed and angry when he was left out of the Team GB football . squad by manager Stuart Pearce that he threatened to boycott the Games altogether. The move was said to have also . shocked Lord Coe - who is in charge of the 2012 organising committee - . and he is thought to have begun secretly making plans to involve Beckham . in the proceedings. Global stage: About 4billion people are expected to tune in to the Games' opening ceremony in Stratford (pictured) It is unclear precisely what role the footballer will play, but speculation that he could light the Olympic torch has been ruled out because the footballer is not an Olympian - a requirement under the rules of the International Olympic Committee. Instead, organisers are said to have added a new section to the ceremony in Stratford to accommodate him. A source told The People: 'It's all being kept secretive because both the   Olympics committee and David Beckham's camp want it to remain a huge surprise. 'It will be a fitting role for David who, let's not forget, was a big factor in the UK winning the Olympic bid in the first place.' Details of his role will be ironed out and finalised tomorrow, sources added. He will not be the only person in his family to play a part in the Games.

Murdered: Rachel Wilson, 19, who went missing from the Southfield Road area of Middlesbrough, where she was a sex worker, in May 2002 . The family of a teenager murdered after going missing a decade ago made an emotional plea today as police confirmed they had found her body. Rachel Wilson, 19, disappeared from Middlesbrough, where she was a sex worker, in May 2002. Cleveland Police today confirmed that human remains found on farmland on the outskirts of the town three weeks ago were hers and said they had reopened the investigation into Rachel's death as a murder inquiry. Speaking at a press conference at the force's headquarters in Middlesbrough, her mother, Tina Wilson, accompanied by Rachel's brother Carl, said: 'For the last ten years we've been sure she'll come in the house. On Friday we found out she wouldn't. 'All I'm asking for is somebody that knows, come forward and let us know and let us find out what happened to Rachel.' The teenager had turned to prostitution to feed a drug addiction that had blighted her life since the age of 16. The last sighting known of her was at about 3.30am on May . 31, 2002, when CCTV images showed her walking along Southfield Road in . the town’s centre. Her remains were found in a shallow grave at 6.15pm on Wednesday, June 27, by a farmer who was working on his land at the Newham Hall Farm estate in Middlesbrough. Following the discovery, the area was placed under police guard, with two marked cars and the entrance taped off. The white forensic tents at the scene sparked speculation on social networking sites, with locals taking to Facebook to express their concern. The tents have now been removed from the site. Appeal: Today Rachel's mother Tina and brother Carl (pictured at a press conference) appealed to anyone with information about what happened to her daughter to come forward. Her remains were found on a farm last month . The news is likely to rock the community of Beechwood where Rachel grew up. She had attended Beechwood Primary and Hall Garth schools and worked for a time at a care home in Eston. A 57-year-old man was arrested in 2003 following her disappearance but released without charge. At one point 100 officers were working on the investigation, which has been led by several senior figures over the last decade. Detective Superintendent Peter McPhillips said the investigation will . focus on those who frequented the area in which Rachel's body was found. 'Obviously one of our lines of inquiry is to see who was accessing that . site and that may well encompass people who use prostitutes,' he said. Case re-opened: Rachel Wilson had turned to prostitution to feed a drug addiction that had blighted her life since the age of 16. The last sighting known of her was at about 3.30am on May . 31, 2002, on CCTV images . 'My message to them is this: It's . never too late to do the right thing.' He said the discovery represents . 'some closure' for Rachel's family but many fundamental questions . remain. 'The anguish they have suffered over the years is unimaginable but they . have never given up hope that Rachel will return home again,' he said. 'There's been a post-mortem examination carried out and we cannot confirm how she died. It's going to be really difficult. We have got no cause of death, there . was no clothing there.' He added that there was a chance police may . never know how she died. Grief: Rachel's mother Tina described her daughter as a 'bubbly character' who 'always wanted to be centre of attention' Police said 'at this moment' they are not treating the murder as being linked to two others that happened around the same time. Vicky Glass was 21 when she vanished from Middlesbrough town centre in . 2000 and her body was found in Danby, in rural North Yorkshire. The body . of Donna Keogh, who went missing from a Middlesbrough house party in . 1998, has never been found. 'Rachel disappeared in 2002 and at that time other girls disappeared. But there is nothing to suggest this is linked to other inquiries,' said . Mr McPhillips. During appeals at the time of Rachel's disappearance, police said they . believed she was working as a prostitute in the Southfield Road area of . Middlesbrough. Officers have already investigated and ruled out links with the Suffolk Strangler murders in 2006. Speaking on the 10th anniversary of Miss Wilson’s disappearance in May, Ms Wilson  had spoken fondly of Rachel, describing her as 'a bubbly character' who 'always wanted to be centre of attention'. Temporary Detective Chief Inspector Gordon Lang also said at the time: 'Rachel visited her family regularly, and was always in touch with one of them on a daily basis. 'Someone somewhere has knowledge of where she went and what happened to her all those years ago, and I am appealing for them to get in touch and tell us what they know. 'Last November we released CCTV footage of Rachel in Middlesbrough town centre and today, 10 years on from her disappearance, we are hoping to uncover what happened to her and bring closure for her family.'","Rachel Wilson, 19, disappeared from Middlesbrough in May 2002 .

The suicide letter arrived on Tuesday this week – three days after Mr Allison embarked on his mission of murderous revenge.

Neglect: Mahroof, pictured with the seven-month-old she abandoned daily, left her while on the school run, which the judge compared to the PM accidentally leaving his daughter Nancy in a pub a few months ago. A neglectful mother has been spared jail after a judge compared her child-rearing abilities to those of David Cameron. Aysiea Mahroof, 27, appeared in the dock after regularly leaving  her seven-month-old daughter home alone. She wept in court as she admitted child neglect, which carries a maximum sentence of ten years. However, Judge Vivian Manning-Davies gave her a community order instead. In doing so, he referred to the recent revelation that Mr Cameron and his wife drove off without their eight-year-old daughter Nancy after a Sunday pub lunch. Mahroof, who routinely left her youngest alone for an hour every day while she took her two older children to and from school, admitted a charge of neglect but claimed she did not know she had done anything illegal. Judge Manning-Davies sympathised, telling her: ‘A parent makes mistakes in relation to children. ‘I include myself in that statement. Recently, by way of an example, the Prime Minister left his own daughter in a pub.’ Mahroof’s school run took 40 minutes in the morning, and 20 in the afternoon. Her neighbours tipped off police after seeing her leave home every day without her baby. When Mahroof was arrested, she pleaded with the officers: ‘If I  don’t do it again, can I go?’ She also told police she could not  manage to get the baby’s buggy down the steps outside her house in Swansea. In addition, she claimed she received no childcare help from her family because they had shunned her after she refused an arranged marriage. Abandoned: The child was left here for 40 minutes in the morning and 20 minutes in the afternoon because she couldn't get the buggy up and down the steps . Judge Manning-Davies gave Mahroof a . community order with 12 months’ supervision, saying her only motive was . to take her children to school. ‘What this case is not, like so many in . court, is that you left children for only self-interest,’ he said. ‘In that situation, I would be  sentencing you to a term of imprisonment. ‘But this is not a case of you being an uncaring mother – quite the contrary.’ Mahroof said after the case that she had not realised leaving her baby alone was illegal. ‘When I took my two children to school my heart was pounding. ‘But I thought I was keeping  her . safe,’ she explained. ‘No  mother wants their child harmed but I didn’t . realise it was the law not to leave them. I will never ever do that . again. ‘I want to thank the judge for understanding my feelings and what I am going through.’ Whoops: David Cameron, pictured holding his daughter Nancy at a wedding in 2007, thought Samantha Cameron had all their children but she thought Nancy was with him . Error: The Plough pub, where the Camerons accidentally left their daughter Nancy when they drove off in separate cars, which the judge compared to Mahroof acts of neglect . The details of the Camerons’  accident . emerged last month, weeks after the Prime Minister was widely ridiculed . after a biography claimed he liked to ‘chillax’ at Chequers on . weekends. After the Sunday lunch in question, . the Prime Minister was  driven back to Chequers with his police . protection officers in one car while his wife Samantha drove children . Arthur, six, and Florence, one, home. Nancy had popped in to the toilet . without telling her parents as  they left and each of her parents . thought she was in the other car. A spokesman for Mr Cameron said he was . ‘distraught’ when he realised what had happened, and confirmed that Mrs . Cameron  had returned to pick up Nancy as soon as they discovered she . was missing. She was found safe and well at the Plough Inn in Cadsden, Buckinghamshire, and taken home.","Aysiea Mahroof, 27, left her daughter while she took her older children on the school run and didn't realise it was illegal .

A kindergarten teacher has been hailed a hero after jumping into a 75ft-deep mine to save the life of a three-year-old child. Ina Koenig emerged bruised, cold, wet and tearful from the chasm near Hanover, but rescued a little boy called Jannic who would have drowned had she not gone in after him. She neither knew how deep the hole was or if she could rescue him. But she jumped in after him in a split second after he vanished into the earth. Heroic: Kindergarten teacher Ina Koenig (in helmet) is pulled from a mine shaft by rescue workers after jumping down the 75ft hole to save a three-year-old pupil . She had to fight for both their lives as they ended up in deep water in the flooded shaft at Osterwald. Her heroism has hit the front pages of newspapers across Germany and Chancellor Angela Merkel has sent her congratulations to the 37-year-old for her 'courage'. Ina is to receive a bravery award from the state of Lower Saxony for her actions and has also been recommended already for the Federal Cross of Merit - Germany's highest civilian award for bravery. For two hours, in the near freezing water, she kept the child’s head above the surface while she battled to stay afloat. Ordeal: Three-year-old Jannic is taken away on a stretcher after being kept afloat for two hours by his teacher before they were rescued by firefighters . They clung to tree roots and bulges in the shaft that was just four and-a-half feet wide until firemen could eventually pull them free. Rescuers said it was only the body heat of Jana that kept Jannic alive in the water. Colleagues of her’s on the surface looking after the 39 other children from the St. Nicolai Kindergarten on a day out called the police and fire service. The shaft was constructed to bring light into a coal mine that closed down years ago. But the wooden planks meant to seal it off from the workings deep underground had rotted. Hidden in a copse of trees, Jannic plunged straight down - followed by his teacher. Dangerous: The shaft, hidden in a wooded aerea in Hanover, was constructed to bring light into a now-disused coal mine, but the planks meant to seal it off from the workings deep underground had rotted . Fire chief Dirk Habenicht said: 'We had to bring in a crane and lower men down the shaft.  We got the little boy into a belt first.  He wasn’t crying, just trembling a little. 'Then we got Ina into the belt and brought her up.  Both were only slightly injured.  The water was cold but it saved them; no water, and the fall would have killed them.' Both were taken to the Hamelin-Pyrmont Sana Clinic where mild hypothermia was diagnosed and Jannic had bruises to his skin.  He is being kept in for observation for a week but she left the clinic after a check up. Jannic is also to undergo counselling for the massive emotional trauma he suffered in the fall. The mine began operating in the middle ages and closed down 100 years ago. The local authority said it tried to fill in the shaft on numerous occasions but it was too deep.  An inquiry is now underway as to why the rotting timber that covered its entrance was not replaced. Ina refused to give interviews to local media, insisting: 'I am not a hero.I did what any human being would do.'","Child fell down chasm in wooded area on school trip in Hanover, Germany .

ITN captured footage of Mr Murdoch waving to Mr Hunt after he spotted the Government minister outside the swimming venue in east London. The two men shook hands and smiled as they exchanged a few words before parting, but their conversation, lasting less than a minute, was not recorded. An aide to Mr Hunt told the Press Association: 'They were both at the swimming and bumped into each other and shook hands and said hello. That's all there was to it. 'I think they were talking about the swimming.' Mr Murdoch was at the Aquatics Centre as a . guest of London Mayor Boris Johnson, while Mr Hunt is a regular visitor . to the Olympic venues in his capacity as Culture Secretary.

Enjoying the Games: Mr Murdoch was at the Aquatics Centre as a guest of London Mayor Boris Johnson, while Mr Hunt is a regular visitor to the Olympic venues in his capacity as Culture Secretary . Mr Mann told the Press Association: 'Hunt just doesn't seem to be able to help himself. He is repeatedly careless and this is another example of it. 'It's quite inappropriate, after what has happened, that the two of them should be together at any stage. He should be avoiding Rupert Murdoch like the plague.' And Mr Sheridan, a member of the Commons Culture Committee which carried out an inquiry into phone-hacking at the News Corp-owned News of the World, said it appeared the relationship between Mr Hunt and Mr Murdoch was 'as close as ever'. 'The relationship between the Conservative Party and the Murdoch empire still looks strong,' said Mr Sheridan. On the offensive: Labour MPs John Mann (left) and Jim Sheridan (right) have criticised Mr Hunt's conduct . 'And after everything that's gone on, the very fact that Boris Johnson invited Murdoch to the Olympics is outrageous. What do Milly Dowler's family make of that I wonder? There appears to be no contrition whatsoever for the mistakes.' Mr Murdoch has faced questioning on the hacking of mobile phones, including that of teenage murder victim Milly Dowler, by both the MPs' committee and the Leveson Inquiry into press standards. Seven former journalists at the News of the World, including ex-editors Rebekah Brooks and Andy Coulson, have been charged with offences in relation to the phone-hacking inquiry.

Mr Hunt came under intense pressure earlier this year when the Leveson Inquiry uncovered a cache of emails detailing contacts between his office and News Corp lobbyist Fred Michel during the abortive bid for BSkyB. Critics also questioned his impartiality after it emerged he had written to David Cameron prior to being given quasi-judicial authority over the bid, arguing the case for the deal to go ahead.

A wealthy former yacht dealer has snapped up every foreclosed home in Michigan's Macomb County, paying the cut price of $4.9million for a whopping 645 properties. Bill McMachen handed over a measly $7,500 on average for each of the properties, of which 403 are family homes, and he's now being bombarded with emails from prospective buyers. 'It's overwhelming,' McMachen told the Detroit News after Tuesday's transaction. 'I'm having a hard time keeping up with them all.' SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Bargain: Former yacht dealer Bill McMachen, pictured, bought every foreclosed home in Michigan's Macomb County for $4.9 million . In an arrangement with the Macomb County, McMachen agreed to take all the foreclosed homes authorities didn't want off their hands in exchange for paying back all taxes owed. 'By packaging the good with the bad, it's in the center for somebody to come in and buy it all,' Macomb County Treasurer Ted Wahby told Fox 2 in Detroit. McMachen expects to make $2million from his investment after fixing up the dilapidated properties. But some investors were less happy about the mass-scale house-flogging deal. Dilapidated homes: McMachen bought 645 homes, many of them in a severely rundown state like that pictured . Crunching numbers: Even after covering the $4.9million he spent purchasing all of the homes, Mr McMachen plans to make approximately $2million in profit by selling off the homes . Around 300 people waited hours at the auction but were turned away, having forked out $500 to register. One would-be buyer told the TV station he was prepared to bid up the four times what McMachen actually paid for some of the homes. 'I feel bad that it went that way,' he said. 'If we knew it was going to happen like this we wouldn't have wasted any time.' But Wahby said the county's job was to collect taxes, which is what they did. 'People who are going to buy five or ten houses weren't buying them because they wanted to move in,' he told Fox 2. Angry investors: Would-be buyers were disappointed with the fire sale . 'They wanted to make money on them, and God bless them, I wish they could have, but that's not my mission. I have a job to do. I have to collect the taxes, and that's what we did.' McMachen and his investment partner plan to sell the homes, perhaps to the investors who missed out at auction. 'They can still buy the property from me, probably for about the same price they would have bought it at the auctions,' McMachen said. WATCH THE VIDEO HERE .

'I think I cried pretty much every night.' She testified against him and he is now serving the maximum 10-year prison sentence. When released, Doyle will have to register as a sex offender. 'Going through that, I felt so guilty,' Harrison said. 'This is the man that I thought I loved. And I just told on him and I put him in jail.' But she turned the tragedy to triumph when her mother sent her to Wakefield, Massachusetts to train with Jimmy Pedro Jr., who won Olympic bronze medals in 1996 and 2004, and his father, Big Jim. She moved into a house with 10 other athletes but struggled with the transition. 'She was an emotional wreck,' Pedro Jr told the Boston Herald.

Revenge: Donald Foster III, allegedly poured bleach into the water tanks used for kidney dialysis machines as revenge against his employer . A kidney dialysis worker accused of asking his patients for painkillers is behind bars after allegedly pouring bleach into the clinic’s dialysis machines. Donald Foster III, 49, who worked at the Fresenius Medical Care clinic in West Columbia, South Carolina, was arrested after a month-long investigation by local authorities. Workers at the clinic discovered the contaminated water before anyone was hurt. He has been charged with attempted murder and second-degree burglary, and is currently being held on $525,000 bond. Foster was suspended from his job as an equipment technician and patient care technician on July 2, but he came back less than a week later and tainted the water, police said. 'He had planned to carry out a mass murder in order to get back at his employer,' Lexington County Sheriff James Metts told the Associated press. Foster poured bleach into tanks that hold the purified water used to filter waste from the bodies of 20 patients, hoping the deaths from his sabotage would bankrupt the firm, police said. The 49-year-old single parent asked a judge to let him out of jail because he needs to take care of his 5-year-old daughter. Scroll down for video .

'This is all a misunderstanding, really,' Foster said, speaking from behind a mesh-covered opening behind a locked door during his arraignment. 'He had no empathy or feeling for human life at all. All he wanted to do was destroy this company.' -Sheriff James Metts . Foster's lawyer asked for a reasonable bond, and declined to talk about the case after the hearing, WMBF reported. Authorities asked for as high of a bond as possible, saying Foster was a flight risk with no regard for the lives of other people. Foster faces up to 45 years in prison if convicted of both charges. Foster was suspended because he was trying to get elderly patients to give him their prescription painkillers, Mr Metts said.

Saturday and poured bleach into the tanks that hold the purified water . for the dialysis treatment, prosecutors alleged. Authorities said that Foster was fully aware that any contaminant could kill . people whose kidneys are already so weak that they filter very little of the . impurities in their blood. Those with poor renal function are reliant on kidney dialysis machines to filter waste from the body, which is the function of healthy kidneys. A patient is hooked up to a dialysis machine, which removes blood from the body and circulated through a fluid circuit outside the body. This process is known as hemodialysis. It is of utmost importance that the water be purse, as any small bit of dirt or debris could affect the blood stream. Pure water is so critical to the dialysis process that workers check the tanks several times a day, including before any patients are hooked up to the machines, said Jon Stone, a spokesman for German-based Fresenius Medical Care. 'Although patients' treatments were slightly delayed, no one was harmed and all of our patients received their scheduled treatments that day. We are proud of our staff and are grateful that they caught this situation,' Stone said in a statement. The workers called police after discovering the contaminated water. Foster was fired, and representatives of the clinic who were at his bond hearing again asked he be kept far away from the facility. They did not give their names. The sheriff said Foster denied the sabotage at first, but as detectives gathered more evidence, his story became less credible. 'He finally did admit he had done it,' Mr Metts said. The indifference Foster showed toward human life and the very patients he made sure were comfortable as they endured dialysis treatments for several hours, several times a week shocked the sheriff.

A ten-year-old boy has been charged with aggravated assault after he attacked his Vietnamese neighbour with sticks, stones and a skipping rope after months of tormenting her. Minh Tran, 51, was found cowering in the backyard of her home in Juniata Park, Philadelphia. According to Tran's landlords, the . boy, who cannot be named for legal reasons, had frequently made fun of her for being 'dumb and . fat'. Minh Tran, pictured left during an interview with American television channel NBC, was attacked in her home . The child recruited his younger friends, thought to be aged seven and nine, on Monday evening for the sickening attack. 'To have such a young offender committing such a violent crime - it's almost a shock to my system,' said Captain John Gallagher of Philadelphia Police East Detectives yesterday. The ten-year-old, who lives one block away from Tran, has been charged as a juvenile with aggravated assault, criminal trespass, and related offenses, according to the District Attorney's Office. The boy's mother handed him over to the police but the identities of the other two boys are still being investigated by Gallagher's unit. 'This ten-year-old torments her in the neighborhood,' said Gallagher. 'He's tried to do things to her before in terms of harassments and threats. 'He chases her and confronts her.' Tran lives on her own on East Luzerne Street in an apartment next door to owner Pastor Dao Tien of Vietnamese Alliance Church. The apartment was converted from a garage when Tien's family took in Tran. Tien said the harassment became routine but was unable to pinpoint when or why it started. Captain John Gallagher said the boy had previously chased and confrotned Minh Tran . The young boys also targeted Tien's family and would often come through the fence into their garden to cause general destruction and turn on the outdoor taps. As recently as 8pm on Saturday, Tien's mother-in-law called the police because the boys were running back and forth outside the house, pounding on the doors. But Tran suffered the worst of the abuse. At around 5.50pm on Monday, the youngsters entered her home through her open front door. 'They saw a chance to get in,' Gallagher said. Once inside, they attacked Tran. One boy even took a plant and threw it at her. Unable to speak English, Tran told a reporter through Tien that she was feeling physically all right. Initially, she anxiously avoided saying what had happened before reluctantly stating that 'they came and they beat me up.' Minh Tran lives on her own on East Luzerne Street, pictured in an apartment next door to owner Pastor Dao Tien of Vietnamese Alliance Church . Tran gestured with the skipping rope how one boy stood over her and whipped her with it before pointing to a broken stick in an attempt to explain that it had also been used during the attack. The boys proceeded to rifle through Tran's cabinets in the hunt for money before eventually settling for her purse and $20. Tran's screams were heard by another family on the property who alerted the boy's mother. The mother called the police without hesitation and explained how she suspects him of other crimes in the neighbourhood. Tran suffered cuts and bruises to her face and cuts and scrapes to her legs, and complained of head and chest pain, police said. Tien said, he took her to Temple University Hospital for treatment later on Monday night. The 10-year-old was being held Tuesday night at the Youth Study Center with a hearing scheduled for Aug 27 in Family Court. In addition to aggravated assault and criminal trespass, the boy was charged with simple assault, conspiracy, possession of an instrument of crime, theft, recklessly endangering another person, robbery, and burglary, according to Tasha Jamerson, a spokeswoman for District Attorney Seth Williams. According to Jamerson, Pennsylvania allows for the criminal prosecution of children under 10 only in cases of murder.","Minh Tran was assaulted by a trio of pre-teens after they entered her Philadelphia home .

Britain's showjumping golden oldies cantered to victory yesterday in a thrilling jump-off – ending a 60-year wait for an Olympic triumph. For the four man team of Nick Skelton, Peter Charles, Scott Brash and Ben Maher – with an average age of 40 – it was also a victory over adversity.

A delighted Skelton, who overcame a . broken neck and hip replacement to continue as one of the world’s . leading showjumpers, said: ‘I’m speechless, unbelievable. What a place . to do it. I have never seen people like it. Unbelievable. The lads have . done great. It’s a dream come true. Absolutely brilliant. Great for the . country, great for our sport. It’s taken all these years.’ Charles doffs his cap to the frenzied crowd after coming through a tense jump-off .

The British . equestrian team is likely to have further medal success today when the . dressage team of Carl Hester, Laura Bechtolsheimer and Charlotte . Dujardin go for gold. Skelton, who will go for a second gold . in the individual event, said he was more nervous watching his . team-mates than riding himself. ‘I wish I could have gone four times,’ he joked. Britain went into yesterday’s second . day tied for second place with Holland, Switzerland and Sweden, three . penalties behind leaders Saudi Arabia, the eventual bronze medal . winners. But at the end of an enthralling second round they shared the . lead with Holland, which set up the astonishing finale. Skelton and Scotsman Brash, riding . Hello Sanctos on his Olympic debut, had both jumped clear, while Maher . had an unlucky fence down and Charles collected five faults. Final Dutch rider Gerco Schroder would . have won the competition in ‘normal time’ had he jumped clear, but four . faults then took it into extra time . Smiles all round as the British team soak up the crowd's acclaim . Leaping into the history books: The team's stunning achievements will be commemorated with this special stamp . At 54, Nick Skelton is our oldest gold medal winner for more than 40 years. A remarkable feat considering he retired 11 years ago after breaking his neck in two places in a fall.He described the experience as hearing ‘a loud crack, literally in my head’. The fall caused a ligament to snap, tearing a piece of bone away from his spine. A year after he had titanium screwed into his head, he was back in the saddle. ‘If it had been just 5mm different, I’d have been dead,’ he said. ‘When they told me I’d never ride again I was in shock. You’ve done it all your life and then it suddenly just stops. ‘In the end it was down to my stallion, Arko III. I knew he could do everything. He was my incentive and inspiration. So when a German doctor said I could ride again, that was enough for me.’ Since then Skelton, who has also had a hip replacement and two knee operations, has won medals at seven championships. His team-mate, Peter Charles, is two years younger at 52 and has also recovered from a serious spinal injury. He ruptured his spinal sheath and broke a vertebrae and three ribs in a fall in 2006. Born in Liverpool to an Irish mother, he had spent 20 years jumping for Ireland. But after recovering from his fall in 2007, he decided to switch nationality and become a British rider.","First showjumping gold for Great Britain since 1952 won in jump-off against the Netherlands .

A street was covered in seaweed after it fell from the sky during freak weather which carried it from a beach 20 miles away. Residents were stunned to find their homes, gardens and cars plastered with smelly marine algae after a storm swept up debris from Clevedon Beach in North Somerset and dumped it in Berkeley, near Cheltenham, Gloucestershire on Sunday. Weather experts believe the unusual downpour was caused by a tornado which formed from several thunderstorms in the area. Smelly downpour: Naomi Sheldon, 16, was stunned to find seaweed had fallen from the sky into her backyard . Resident Dr Richard Overton, 55, collected an entire bucket full of the green gunk from his front garden with still more to clear up. The engineer said: ‘I looked out of the window after a very big storm finished and to my amazement there were lots of flakes of seaweed scattered over the garden. ‘I’ve heard stories of fish being picked up and dumped by storms but never seaweed. I was just so surprised. Caused by thunderstorms: Weather experts believe several thunderstorms on Clevedon Beach and another nearby created a tornado that could have swept up the seaweed, dumping it in Berkeley 20 miles away . Front garden full: Dr Richard Overton was surprised to find his garden filled with seaweed and has struggled to clear it all up . ‘It’s a shame really because had it have been fish we could have made a tasty dish with it but you can’t really do the same with seaweed.’ Weather expert, Ian Fergusson from the Met Office, said the strange downpour could have occurred because of thunderstorms on Clevedon Beach. Fish - reported several times . Frogs and tadpoles - Greece, 1981 . Squid - Falklands Island, 1997 . Spiders - Argentina, 2007 . He said: ‘At the same time as this incident was reported there were several thunderstorms in the area, one of which was pictured by satellites, on a nearby beach. ‘If one of the funnel clouds touched down onto the beach, making it a tornado it could have quite possibly picked up the seaweed and other debris if the tide was out and then later dumped it down the road at Berkeley Heath. ‘It is a very strange event but it is possible. Look out for fish in your garden too!’ Dr Overton’s wife Kay said they were struggling of clear all the debris from their garden because so much seaweed had fallen. She said: ‘We’ve managed to pick up . quite a lot of it now but there is still loads there because it’s . camouflaged in the bushes and grass.’ Far away: Seaweed from Clevedon Beach in North Somerset made up the unusual downpour that plastered a residential street on Sunday . Dr Overton said: ‘We’ve put it all in a big pot and we’ll probably just wait for it to wither away. It’s quite funny really, just so strange.’ Other residents on ‘The Common’, an up-market lane which overlooks acres of fields, also found seaweed in their gardens. Neighbour Steven Belton said: ‘We had really heavy rain yesterday (Sunday), our garden was almost flooded. ‘We didn’t really notice anything out of the ordinary but after speaking to Richard and Kay we found quite a lot of the seaweed in out driveway. ‘It’s very strange, just so, so odd.’","Seaweed fell from the sky in Berkeley during thunderstorms on Sunday .

A Qantas jet touched down in Melbourne without two of its first class passengers, because they refused to fly when the airline could not provide them with the right size of luxury pyjamas. The extraordinary dilemma facing the A380 superjet’s crew could not be resolved before the aircraft took off from Los Angeles and so the angry couple demanded to leave the plane just as it was preparing to taxi from the terminal. The Australian couple absolutely refused a pair of business class pyjamas and insisted they had the first class type in XL-size or they would wait for another flight. Delayed: A Qantas A380 flight from Los Angeles to Melbourne was delayed when two first class passengers demanded they were given the right sized pyjamas . Finally the aircraft crew agreed, the doors were opened and the grumpy pair walked back into the terminal. It meant the aircraft was delayed for departure for the 15-hour flight across the Pacific by 30 minutes while the couple’s baggage was unloaded. But rather than feeling angry about the situation, the other passengers on board were said to have roared with laughter when the captain announced the reason for the delay, Melbourne’s Herald Sun newspaper reported. Business class passenger Angela Ceberano said the captain had no hesitation in explaining the reason for a delayed take-off. ‘He said: “Just to inform you all, the reason we’ve had the delay is because two of our first class passengers refused to fly on this plane as there were no extra large pyjamas on board for them,’ said Miss Ceberano. She added that ‘the pyjama guy’ wanted the crew to tell everyone why the plane was late. ‘In his mind, he thought everyone sympathised with him,’ said Miss Ceberano. ‘If you didn’t laugh, you would have cried. It was unbelievable.’ Back to the terminal: The couple were left behind at Los Angeles Airport after refusing to stay on the Qantas flight . Another passenger, who wanted to be known only as Ian, said passengers in first class could not believe what they were hearing. ‘They (the couple) were quite upset and simply refused to fly without pyjamas that fitted,’ he told the Herald Sun. ‘In the end, they disembarked and the flight was delayed as their baggage was removed.’ According to the airline, first class passengers are usually offered ‘soft and luxurious pyjamas and slippers.' It also describes first class as a ‘private sanctuary in the sky.’ Last night Qantas confirmed two passengers chose to get off a jet prior to departure in LA, but other passengers were unaffected and the aircraft touched down in Melbourne on schedule.","Couple insist on right size nightwear and turn down offer of business class pyjamas .

A spurned teenager stabbed his ex-girlfriend to death with a six inch kitchen knife just hours after she begged police for help, a court heard. Thomas Dalton, 19, is accused of waiting for Samantha Laney, 19, for 45 minutes outside her home before launching a vicious attack on her and her father. Stafford Crown Court heard shortly after the killing Dalton updated his Facebook profile, saying: 'Some things got to be done in life.' Murder charge: Thomas Dalton, 19, (left) is accused of stabbing Samantha Laney, 19, after lying in wait for 45 minutes outside her home before . launching a vicious attack on her and her father . Miss Laney bled to death after a single stab wound to the back which punctured her lung and severed an artery. Dalton is also accused of stabbing Miss Laney's father Steven Laney during the attack inside the family’s home in Newcastle-under-Lyme, Staffs., on February 21. Mr Laney survived but the Court heard how just hours before her death, Miss Laney had called the police and asked them to help her after she received a string of violent threats from Dalton. But officers refused to provide a police escort to accompany her to Dalton’s home to collect her belongings, saying they were too busy. Philip Bennetts QC, prosecuting, told . the court Dalton had told Samantha he was going to 'slice her open' after she ended their relationship in January. He . said Samantha had contacted Dalton to try and arrange for her or her . dad to collect her personal items from his flat in Kidsgrove, Staffs. The court heard he refused and threatened to kill her if she went near his home. Dalton is also accused of stabbing Miss Laney's father Steven (pictured), during the attack at their home in Newcastle-under-Lyme . Mr Bennetts said: 'Samantha rang the police, asking for a police escort. She was told there were not enough police officers available. 'Samantha went to her aunt’s home. Dalton rang, ranting down the phone. He said if she or Steven went to their flat, he was going to slice them open. 'Steven entered Samantha’s house first, followed by Samantha and then her friend Elise. Elise attempted to close the door, but the door was flung open. 'Dalton, knife in hand, asked where Samantha was. Samantha was in the doorway between the kitchen and the hallway. Dalton ran up to her and stabbed her. 'Steven did not see the stabbing, but he saw Dalton with the knife. He ran up to him, and Dalton held the knife against him, trying to stab him. 'They struggled. During their struggle the knife fell to the floor.' The . jury heard witnesses saw a man matching Dalton’s description standing . near the address at 4.40pm, 45 minutes before Samantha arrived home.

The court was told Dalton then fled but was later arrested as he walked along the A34 towards his home in Kidsgrove. Despite the efforts of paramedics, Samantha died shortly after 6pm. Mr Bennetts said that while on remand, Dalton had written about the events of February 21, as part of a 'life story'.

Now that Kobe Bryant has finally joined the fun, the U.S. men's basketball team appears complete. There are some major defensive flaws but that hardly matters to this suped-up, scoring machine that goes from zero to 100 points in seconds. Overpowering and dominant in a way not seen since the 1992 Dream Team, the Americans are now two wins from a second straight Olympic gold medal. Dominated: Patrick Mills of Australia moves the ball against Deron Williams of United States . Argentina awaits. Carmelo Anthony said: 'We're ready.' Pushed by teammate Kevin Durant to 'turn it on', Bryant scored 20 points - all in the second half - and the U.S. team stomped its way into the semifinals with a 119-86 win on Wednesday night over Australia, which scrapped as hard as it could until the world's best team put the game away. Bryant made six 3-pointers, LeBron James racked up a triple-double with 11 points, 14 rebounds and 12 assists and the U.S. moved a step closer to gold on the 20th anniversary of the '92 team's historic rampage in Barcelona. With NBA Commissioner David Stern and two-time Olympian Dwyane Wade watching from the stands, the Americans set up a rematch in the semifinals with Argentina - a team they buried by 29 in the preliminary round. Unless the Argentines, with their roster of thirty-somethings, can find a way to slow down the U.S., another lopsided loss seems inevitable. 'We have maybe a five-percent chance of winning,' forward Manu Ginobili said after Argentina beat Brazil 82-77 to set up a third straight meeting with the U.S. in the semifinals. 'But we are going to fight for that.' Bryant had been more spectator than spectacular since coming to London. He . entered the quarterfinals averaging just 9.4 points per game, touching . off questions about whether he was hurt, disinterested or perhaps unable . to produce the same way Anthony, Durant and James have been. Nobody's . wondering any longer. At halftime, Anthony and Durant both pushed the . man nicknamed the Black Mamba to do more, and Bryant struck back with a . barrage of 3-pointers that sent the U.S. bench into a towel-waving . frenzy. 'He was a little sleepy out there,' Anthony said. 'I guess I woke up the Mamba and he responded.' Deron . Williams added 18 points, Anthony 17 and Durant 14 for the Americans, . who pounded Argentina 126-97 on Monday night in their preliminary-round . finale. Tempers flared in that one when . Argentina guard Facunda Campazzo intentionally punched Anthony in the . groin. Campazzo said he retaliated for being punched earlier by U.S. guard Chris Paul, who never denied that he took a swipe at Campazzo. Anthony doesn't expect the Argentines to play nice again. 'You just have to go out there and take them punches - not literally,' he said. 'We're excited about it. Just now in the huddle we said we gotta prepare for them.' Winning side: LeBron James runs with the ball in the game which took the U.S. to the Olympic semi-finals . Down by 14 at halftime, Australia was determined to make it a game and scored the first 11 points of the second half, cutting the Americans' lead to three. The U.S. was only ahead by six before Bryant, who had struggled with his shot and foul trouble in previous games, finally broke out. He made a 3-pointer, batted away a pass and chased it down along the left sideline. Feeling a rhythm that had been missing, Bryant pulled up and dropped another 3 that made it 70-58. Two shots in 18 seconds was all it took - Bryant was back. 'Somebody made him mad. I could see it in his eyes,' Durant said. 'I wanted him to kind of turn it on and that's what he did. That was the first time we've seen it here. He got so upset and when he does that he's in another world. It was just a matter of time.' Bryant laughed when told there were doubters back home. The Aussies knew he was dead serious. 'Kobe got a little bit sniff,' Patty Mills said. 'And for great teams, that's all they need and they stretch it out.' Mills scored 26 points and Joe Ingles had 19 for Australia, which had the misfortune of running into the U.S. in the quarterfinals for the second straight Olympics. By the time Bryant got done, even the Australian fans were cheering for him as he walked to the locker room, bumping fists with a Aussies' kangaroo mascot wearing boxing gloves. This was another knockout, albeit one in the late rounds, for the Americans. All that's between the U.S. and a gold medal now is Argentina, a dangerous team with swagger and experience, and a matchup with the Russia-Spain semifinal winner. The Americans have tangled with the Spaniards before, beating them in the gold-medal game four years ago. A matchup with Russia would rekindle Cold Ward memories and the 1972 final in Munich, when the U.S. had its 63-game winning streak stopped amid a controversial ending still debated today. The U.S. has shown moments of vulnerability in this tourney. Not many, but a few. It came in as the team to beat, and through six games, that hasn't changed.

Millions of New Yorkers were today struggling to go about their normal day after one of the busiest cities in the world was brought to its knees by one of the biggest storm's in its history. The city that never sleeps spent the night at a virtual standstill and cloaked in darkness, waking up today to deal with the aftermath of Hurricane Sandy which has so far claimed the lives of 18 people and caused what is expected to be $20billion of damage. As daylight finally illuminated the streets this morning, New Yorkers were faced with a flooded subway, shuttered financial markets, closed schools, deserted streets and many homes still without power after a night which saw a wall of sea water and high winds slam into the city.

Buildings were destroyed, tunnels going into and out of Manhattan were flooded, dozens of trees and power lines were felled and thousands had fled from their homes. Some would have no homes to return to after at least 50 in the Queens area flooded and caught fire. This morning, there were police officers on every corner, patrol cars circling the neighborhoods on the lookout for looters and casualties. Traffic lights were down and streets and subways were eerily empty. Those on the streets seemed confused as to what to do and how to go about it. High above midtown, the broken boom of a crane continued to dangle precariously over a neighborhood. New York City police officers put up police tape in front of a subway station today .

The city's subway, which is 108 years old, has never faced a disaster as devastating as last night, an MTA spokesman said today. 'We knew that this was going to be a very dangerous storm, and the storm has met our expectations,' Mayor Michael Bloomberg said today. 'This is a once-in-a-long-time storm.' From 8pm last night, lower Manhattan was bathed in darkness as the power went out from one neighborhood to another like a domino effect. Soon after, the city's cell phone networks stopped working leaving people in virtual obscurity. 'We see a pop. The whole sky lights up,' said Dani Hart, 30, who was watching the storm from the roof of her building in the Navy Yards.

'They said to take only what we needed, and leave the rest, because we'll come back in two or three days,' she said as she and hundreds of others gathered in the luggage-strewn marble lobby. 'I hope so.' It could be several days to a week before all residents who lost power during the storm get their lights back, officials said.

Only a few emergency or backup lights appeared in buildings. Further downtown, only the flicker of candlelight could be seen from windows, the usually bustling financial district was both flooded with water and cloaked in darkness.

There can only be one person in New York who would use Hurricane Sandy to garner yet more publicity for himself – and that is Donald Trump. The billionaire real estate mogul, 66, launched into a self-serving attack on President Obama just hours after the devastating storm hit the East Coast. And as the city struggled to recover from a blackout, Trump, 66, lashed out as he accused the President of using Sandy to win votes for next week’s election. Trump tweet: The billionaire real estate mogul, 66, launched into a self-serving attack on President Obama just hours after the devastating storm hit the East Coast . He tweeted: ‘Not only giving out money, but Obama will be seen today standing in water and rain like he is a real President - don't fall for it. 'Hurricane is good luck for Obama again- he will buy the election by handing out billions of dollars.’ After offering $5 million to charity in a bid to get President Obama to produce his college records and passport application in a desperate publicity stunt, Trump today said he was extending the deadline until midday on Thursday due to the hurricane. He tweeted: 'Another great cause Obama could send my $5M donation to is a charity for 9/11 First Responders. They are American heroes. ‘Don't let Obama buy the election by handing out unlimited free money to states,’ adding: ‘Remember this: Obama wants to raise taxes, @MittRomney wants to lower taxes - need I say more.’ Scathing: Trump claimed Hurricane Sandy would be 'good luck' for President Obama . Online abuse: The barrage of anti Obama tweets have left a sour taste in some people's mouths. Even Trump¿s good friend Barbara Walters has made a plea for him to stop . Trump also boasted that Trump Tower on 5th Avenue in Manhattan had stayed open last night during the storm, saying: ‘We are taking care of hundreds of people in the Trump Tower atrium - they are seeking refuge. Free coffee and food. And posting a picture on Facebook, he wrote: ‘People having a great time in the Trump Tower atrium - unlike others, I stayed open. U.S. President Barack Obama walks from the podium after delivering a statement on the Hurricane Sandy situation . 'He then boasted: 'The Trump Tower atrium is such a great place & kept thousands of people warm & safe during the storm--thanks, staff' As a broken crane continues to dangle 90 stories above a luxury building on West 57th street, Trump even found time to gripe: ‘I am the best builder but if that were my building with the crane mishap, I would have been lambasted from coast to coast.’ Even Trump’s good friend Barbara Walters has made a plea for him to stop. On The View last week, the TV veteran begged: ‘You and I have known each other for many years. ‘And you know that I am your friend, and I think you are a brilliant businessman, and you are great on television, and you have a fascinating personality. Donald, you're making a fool of yourself. ‘You're not hurting Obama. You're hurting Donald, and that hurts me because you're a decent man. Stop it. Get off it, Donald.’ Meanwhile, President Obama last week joked that Trump’s issue with him stemmed from a childhood feud in Kenya. Trump's outpouring was met by general disdain from New Yorkers - including by model Chrissy Teigen, the fiancee of singer John Legend.The stunning brunette tweeted today: 'Finally unfollowed donald trump. my blood pressure skyrockets when he tweets and I will not allow him to have the pleasure any longer.' And the Trump was keen not to stop as he continued with his onslaught of tweets, writing: 'The election is trending towards @MittRomney. Americans know we can't afford another 4 years of the Obama economic decline. 'These last 4 years have not had a single quarter over 4% GDP. Obama has overseen the weakest economic recovery in American history' To add insult to injury, Trump will inflict his views on the rest of America tonight when he appears on Late Night With Jimmy Fallon.","The real estate mogul said the super storm had been 'good luck' for the President .

Arrested: Laszlo Csatary was the world's most wanted Nazi for his alleged role in the Holocaust . The world's number one Nazi war crimes suspect is facing prison in the city he once ruled with fear. Authorities in Slovakia want Laszlo Csatary to serve a life sentence for his role in the deportation of 15,700 Jews to the Auschwitz death camp. Csatary, 97, is under house arrest in Hungary after it was revealed he was secretly living in Budapest. Now the authorities there are considering bringing new war crime charges against him. But Slovakia's Justice Minister Tomas Borec has asked a court in Kassa where Csatary was a police chief to issue an international arrest warrant and make an extradition request. He said:'This is one of the last possibilities for us to punish someone for crimes carried out during the Second World War. 'Csatary's crimes cannot be justified on the basis he acted on orders.' Csatary - full name Laszlo Csizsik-Csatary - is number one on the Simon Wiesenthal Centre's wanted list. He was a senior police officer in Kosice, which at that time . was occupied by Nazi ally Hungary and is now in Slovakia. He fled after the war, but in 1948, a court condemned him to death. Prosecutors said he was present when trains took Jewish men, women and children to Auschwitz. Slovakia has indicated the sentence will be commuted to life in prison if he is extradited. After the war, Csatary sneaked into Canada, where he worked as an art dealer in Montreal and . Toronto until in the 1990s he was stripped of his citizenship there and . was forced to flee. He . ended up in Budapest where he has lived undisturbed until the . Wiesenthal Center alerted Hungarian authorities last year, providing it . with evidence it said implicated Csatary in war crimes. He was then tracked down by the Sun newspaper, who photographed him after confronting him at his front door. Acting on the information provided by . the Wiesenthal Center, which was supplemented by fresh evidence last . week over the deportation of some 300 other Jews in 1941, prosecutors . began an investigation in September. A statement by prosecutors last month, however, appeared to limit the chances that the old man will end up in the dock. Manhunt: The 97-year-old arrested and questioned by Budapest police. He is accused of orchestrating the murder of 15,700 Jewish Hungarians . Case: Csatary was a senior police officer at the time he is accused of committing the crimes . The . events 'took place 68 years ago in an area that now falls under the . jurisdiction of another country - which also with regard to the related . international conventions raises several investigative and legal . problems.' Efraim . Zuroff, the Wiesenthal Center's chief Nazi-hunter, said that . he has been 'very upset and very frustrated' about the lack of action by . Hungarian authorities. The . fact that Csatary lived freely in Hungary for some 15 years and the . lack of progress by prosecutors also added to worries about the . direction of the EU member state under right-wing Prime Minister Viktor . Orban. Almost exactly a . year ago, a court in Budapest acquitted Hungarian Sandor Kepiro, 97, of . charges of ordering the execution of over 30 Jews and Serbs in the . Serbian town of Novi Sad in January 1942. The . Wiesenthal Center, which had also listed Kepiro as the most wanted Nazi . war criminal and helped bring him to court, described the verdict as an . 'outrageous miscarriage of justice'. Six weeks later Kepiro died.

Slow progress by prosecutors has added to worries about the direction of Hungary under right-wing PM Viktor Orban (right) Prior to his arrest: The European Union of Jewish Students stand with their hands taped together in front of Csatary's home . Recent months have seen something of a . public rehabilitation of controversial figures, most notably of Miklos . Horthy, Hungary's dictator from 1920 until falling out with his . erstwhile ally Adolf Hitler in 1944. Anti-Semitic . writers like Albert Wass and Jozsef Nyiro, a keen supporter of the . brutal Arrow Cross regime installed in power by the Nazis in 1944, have . also been reintroduced into the curriculum for schools. Other . incidents include the verbal assault of a 90-year-old rabbi, Jozsef . Schweitzer, when a stranger came up to him in the street and said 'I . hate all Jews!' The . decision by the speaker of the Hungarian parliament, Orban ally Laszlo . Kover, to attend a ceremony in May honouring Nyiro, prompted Nobel . laureate Elie Wiesel to return Hungary's highest honour in disgust. Holocaust . survivor Mr Wiesel, 83, said: 'It has become increasingly clear that . Hungarian authorities are encouraging the whitewashing of tragic and . criminal episodes in Hungary's past.' The . speaker of Israel's Knesset followed this up by withdrawing an . invitation to Kover to a ceremony this week in Israel paying tribute to .

Csatary, the former police commander of the Jewish ghetto in Kassa, Hungary, is accused of complicity in transporting thousands to their deaths . Laszlo Csatary is number one on the Simon Wiesenthal Centre's list of Nazi war criminals known to be alive and at large almost seven decades after the end of the Second World War. Csatary, 97, is listed by the Vienna-based Nazi-hunters as having 'helped organise the deportation to Auschwitz of approximately 15,700 Jews' from Nazi-occupied Czechoslovakia in early 1944.

Hooper was sentenced to death for killing 23-year-old Cynthia Lynn Jarman and her two children, 5-year-old Tonya and 3-year-old Timmy. Prosecutors alleged that the victims were with Hooper in a pickup truck in a mowed field when he placed a 9mm pistol under Cynthia Jarman's chin and shot her, then shot the children to prevent them from being witnesses. Each of the victims was shot twice in the head, and their bodies were buried in a shallow grave in a field northwest of Oklahoma City. Hooper had sued the state last month in an effort to halt his execution, claiming that Oklahoma's three-drug lethal injection protocol was unconstitutional. Victims: Hooper was sentenced to death for killing 23-year-old Cynthia Lynn Jarman and her two children, 5-year-old Tonya and 3-year-old Timmy . Potential witnesses: Hooper in a pickup truck in a mowed field when he placed a 9mm pistol under Cynthia Jarman's chin and shot her, then shot the children to prevent them from being witnesses. The lawsuit sought to force the state to have an extra dose of pentobarbital, a sedative, on hand during his execution. Pentobarbital is the first drug administered during lethal injections in Oklahoma and is used to render a condemned inmate unconscious. It's followed by vecuronium bromide, which stops the inmate's breathing, then potassium chloride to stop the heart. Hooper's attorney, Jim Drummond, had argued that if the sedative were ineffective, the remaining drugs could cause great pain in violation of the Eighth Amendment's prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment. The lawsuit also noted that other states have adopted a one-drug process using a fast-acting barbiturate that supporters say causes no pain. But his request to stall the execution was rejected by a federal judge, then upheld by a federal appeals court. And the U.S. Supreme Court rejected Hooper's request without elaboration just hours before his execution. Hooper was the fourth death-row inmate executed in Oklahoma this year. Gary Roland Welch was executed Jan. 5 for fatally stabbing a 35-year-old man, and Timothy Stemple was executed on March 15 for the beating death of his wife. Michael Selsor was put to death on May 1 for the shooting death of a Tulsa convenience store manager. VIDEO: Lethal injection explained...","Michael Hooper, 39, was executed in Oklahoma on Tuesday .

Outrage is growing over police claims that a 21-year-old man shot himself in the head while handcuffed in the back of a squad car last month. Chavis Carter was arrested on July 28 in Jonesboro, Arkansas, after police found a $10 baggie of marijuana in his pocket following a search during a routine traffic stop. Police say they missed the .380-caliber handgun Carter was carrying during two searches and that he was able to pull it out and commit suicide. But his family and activists are skeptical and claim his is one more wrongful death of a young black at the hands of authorities. Skeptical: Chavis Carter's family says he wasn't suicidal and they are doubting the official police version of events in his shooting . Bizarre: Police in Jonesboro, Arkansas, say they missed the small handgun Carter was carrying and only found it after he had shot himself in the temple while being held in a squad car . 'If you could find a dime bag of marijuana on a person, you could find a .380,' his great-aunt, Cassie Carter, said. Local authorities are now investigating Carter's death, and the FBI is monitoring the case. Jonesboro Police Chief Michael Yates said this week it appears that Carter shot himself, but he said he's waiting on autopsy results which could provide more details about the shooting. In the meantime, Carter's great-aunt said supporters are planning a vigil Sunday night in a park in Tunica, Mississippi, not far from where Carter used to live in Southaven, Mississippi. Supporters also have been expressing their doubts about the police account online. Columnists and pundits have been skeptical of the official police story -- comparing it to the deaths of Trayvon Martin, the unarmed teen who was killed by a neighborhood watch volunteer who claimed self defense, and Sean Bell, a New York man shot four times in 2006 when police opened fire on his car as he was leaving a nightclub because they thought he had a gun. 'How do you shoot yourself in the head . with your hands handcuffed behind your back? Police are out of control,' rapper Talib Kweli wrote earlier this month on Twitter. Wanted: Officers discovered a $10 baggie of marijuana in Carter's pocket and also discovered he was wanted on a warrant from Mississippi . A Facebook group called 'Justice for Chavis Carter' says: '21 year old Chavis Carter was shot in cold blooded murder. This was NOT A suicide attempt.' It has nearly 3,000 followers. Carter's great-aunt said she has been wondering the same thing, especially since her great-nephew didn't seem to have a sad bone in his body. 'It's hard for me to accept the fact that he would do something like that due to his personality,' Cassie Carter said by phone from Lorain, Ohio, where she lives. 'How do you shoot yourself in the head . with your hands handcuffed behind your back? Police are out of control.' Rapper Talib Kweli on Twitter . Russell Marlin, a Memphis-based attorney representing Carter's mother and grandmother, declined to talk about what they believe happened. But Carter's mother, Teresa, told a Memphis television station that her son wasn't suicidal. Police said video and audio recordings, as well as statements from witnesses, show neither officer pulled his weapon nor fired a shot during the traffic stop. However, police have refused to release those recordings, citing the ongoing investigation. Yates said investigators have figured out several ways someone could shoot themselves while handcuffed, although he refused to describe them while the investigation was under way. Jeff Walker, who chairs the criminal justice department at the University of Arkansas at Little Rock, agreed it was possible. 'It is very, very, very rare and usually it's on a missed gun,' he said. Yet, . less than two weeks after Carter was shot on July 28, police in Mobile, . Alabama, said a man shot himself in the torso while he was handcuffed . in the back of a squad car. That . 51-year-old man survived, Mobile police spokeswoman Ashley Rains said. She said officers responding to a report of a domestic dispute on . Wednesday found two knives when they searched the man but missed the . gun. Yates, the police . chief in Jonesboro, about 130 miles northeast of Little Rock, said most . officers eventually miss something in a search. Rallying cry: Carter's death has been compared to the shooting of Trayvon Martin as well as wrongful police shootings in the past . 'Most of them, sooner or later, you find yourself in a position where you missed a knife or a firearm or some drugs or a razor or something like that,' he said. In Carter's case, the searches came after police received a report of a suspicious vehicle driving up and down a residential street in Jonesboro. Police pulled the truck over and frisked or patted down the three men inside. One of the officers found marijuana in Carter's pocket and placed him in the back of a patrol car, without handcuffs, according to the police report. Carter gave police a false name, but at some point, they learned who he was and that there was an arrest warrant for him in Mississippi. Court records show it had to do with a drug case out of DeSoto County. One of the officers handcuffed Carter, searched him again and put him back in the patrol car, police said. The officers spoke to the other men in the truck for a while and then released them because they didn't have any outstanding warrants, police said. As the officers were getting ready to leave, one smelled something burning and noticed Carter slumped over in the patrol car. He was covered in blood, according to the police report, which concluded he had managed to conceal a handgun he used to shoot himself. He later died at a hospital. Both officers are on paid leave while the investigation continues.","Chavis Carter was arrested in Jonesboro, Arkansas, on July 28 after police found $10 worth of marijuana in his pocket .

The stoppage in France may include up to 250 staff. If it goes ahead it will affect many easyJet flights in France but not all the airline's flights to and from the country. To increase the impact, the walkout coincides with the busy Assumption Day holiday period in France. A spokesman for the airline said: 'The company regrets that some of its pilots have chosen to move ahead with an industrial action rather than coming back to the negotiations table, particularly in this busy period for holidaymakers. Heading for the exit doors: Pilots are threatening to walk out over a dispute about pay . 'The management remains open to discussion and calls the SNPL union representatives to resume negotiations.'

Panic: 76-year-old William Mueller's death has sparked fears the virus epidemic may be spreading . An Illinois man has been killed by the West Nile virus, sparking fears the deadly disease is spreading. 76-year-old William Mueller died on Saturday, two weeks after being hospitalised. Serving as president of Lombard Village, Mueller was described by his family as 'an amazing dad, husband and grandpa'. He becomes the 27th person to be killed by the mosquito-borne virus in the U.S., of 694 cases - the sharpest spike in case numbers seen since 2004 that is baffling experts.. 'It is not clear why we are seeing more activity than in recent years,' Marc Fischer of the CDC told CNN. 'Regardless of the reasons for the increase, people should be aware of the West Nile virus activity in their area and take action to protect themselves and their family.' There is no medication to treat West Nile virus, symptoms of which include fever, headache, body aches, joint pains, vomiting, diarrhea or rash. No vaccinations exist, either. The Majority of cases have been recorded in Texas, Mississippi and Oklahoma. In Dallas panic has deepened since a judge declared the epidemic to be a public health emergency. An aerial assault was launched on the blood-sucking insect population for the first time in 45 years in a bid to combat the spread. Aircraft loaded with insecticide have sprayed parts of the north east of Dallas County, after the virus killed 10 people and left at least 230 more ill. Although commonplace in other major cities, the efforts have provoked a debate in the Dallas area between health officials trying to reduce the risk of disease and residents concerned about the dangers posed by the chemical cloud drifting down from above them. Preparing for action: An aircraft carrying insecticide is loaded with fuel before taking off to spray parts of Dallas County as part of the battle against the spread of the West Nile virus . Battle: An aircraft sprays insecticide over part of Dallas County . 'I cannot have any more deaths on my conscience because we did not take action,' Dallas mayor Mike Rawlings said. Aerial . spraying is also being used elsewhere, including in neighborhoods in . New York City and Sacramento, California, to combat the spread of West . Nile virus. Cases of West Nile Virus have also been reported in the Chicago area, with officials spraying the nearby town of Skokie with insecticide. Two people have been taken ill with the virus in Skokie, while the Chicago suburb of Lake County has reported its first case. State of emergency: The Culex quinquefasciatus mosquito is associated with transmission of the West Nile virus . Nearly half of all West Nile cases in . the United States so far this year are in Texas, however, according to . the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. If the trend continues, 2012 will be the worst West Nile year in the southern state's history. The hot, dry weather has created ideal conditions for some species of mosquito. The heat speeds up their life cycle, which accelerates the virus's replication process. And during a drought, standing water can quickly turn stagnant when it's not flushed away by rain or runoff.

Both the mayor and Dallas County Judge Clay Jenkins have declared a state of . emergency and voiced their support for the use of aircraft to battle the virus. Yet even with the threat of . infection, the spraying has sparked widespread opposition from people . who fear the chemicals could be harmful. Because of the severity of the outbreak, the Texas Health Department is stepping in to oversee the effort and to pay for it.

About eight-tenths of an ounce of chemical is applied per acre. The . insecticide's common name is Duet Dual-Action Adulticide.

West Nile Virus (WNV) is found in . both temperate and tropical regions, having been first identified in the . West Nile region of Uganda in 1937. It mainly infects birds and horses, and human infection is almost always transmitted through the bite of an infected mosquito. Symptoms include fever, headache, excessive sweating), weakness,  drowsiness and, pain in the joints. Stronger strains of the virus can inuce nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea. The most dangerous form can lead to unconsciousness, sometimes approaching near-coma, and death. Up to 80 per cent of human infections do not show any symptoms. WNV . emerged as a distinct virus around 1,000 years ago, developing into two . distinct forms. One has been transmitted in Africa and around the . world, while the other has been confined to Africa - although it has been recently detected in horses Europe. The label . says it's toxic to fish and other types of aquatic life, and it contains . distilled petroleum. Kelly Nash, . who lives in Dallas and works for an environmental consulting firm, has questioned the move. 'One . ounce an acre doesn't sound like much, but we will spray at least 2,000 . gallons all over the city,' Nash said. 'A 2,000-gallon oil spill would . be significant. 'I'm concerned that we're breeding resistant mosquitoes . that next time will have Dengue fever or something worse.' Harris . County, which includes humid, mosquito-filled Houston, has used aerial . spraying once a year since 2002, the year the virus was first detected . in Texas. 'We can't be everywhere at all . times,' Mosquito Control Director Dr. Rudy Bueno said. 'Aerial treatment . is a way to supplement what we do on the ground.' Most people . infected with West Nile virus won't get sick, but about one in 150 . people will develop the severe form of the illness.

An accused serial molesting tattoo artist is facing 150 years behind bars for trying to force a 17-year-old to have sex with her mother's boyfriend and allegedly committing nearly 200 other sex crimes against children as young as four. Walter Meyerle, 35, of Falls Township, Pennsylvania, is on trial for the catalogue of twisted abuse, allegedly committed against 15 children from 1998 to 2011. Evidence presented in court on Thursday accuses the man of trying to make the unnamed Croydon 17-year-old take photos of classmates in her school locker room as well as threatening to send her mother nude photos he had made her take of herself if she didn't do as he said. On trial: Walter Meyerle, 35, pictured, is on trial for a catalogue of twisted abuse, allegedly committed against 15 children from 1998 to 2011 . One of the photos presented in Bucks County Court, on the fourth day of the trial, showed the teen topless, with her nine-year-old sister touching her breasts, according to Philly.com. 'Payback is a bitch,' Meyerle told the teenager in exchanges read out by Assistant District Attorney Jennifer Schorn, after she refused to tease and have sex with her mother’s boyfriend. 'Now you will have no friends when they see what you did with kids,' he told her. The man is also facing child pornography charges and his expansive collection cleared the courtroom on Thursday, according to Phillyburbs.com. Approximately 50 videos and 30 photos . were found on Meyerle's computers and cell phone following his arrest . last year, and included images of 'rapes of children, children with . adults, children with children, children with animals,' Bucks County . Judge Gibbons said. Horrific: Meyerle's collection of shocking child pornography nearly cleared the Bucks County Court, pictured, on Thursday . Some of the movies involved very young children crying and saying 'no,no' during sex acts. The 17-year-old Benjamin Franklin Freshman Academy student said she was introduced to Meyerle in 2010 by a friend who was also abused and a series of text messages from February and March 2011 suggest the pair were an item. Most of the exchanges involved phone sex, with the tattoo artist dictating the sexual favours he wanted performed, according to Philly.com. Meyerle also convinced the teen to send him naked photos of herself, which he used to blackmail her when she refused to do as she was told. He initially talked the girl into sending photos of her wearing a bra and knickers, and then to 'lose the bra,' because he could get her a job modeling bikinis, according to Philly.com. He also had the minor hold up a sign saying, 'Hi Steve,' and he sent those photos to a friend, detective and phone records show. Lockdown: Meyerle was in court in February to face further abuse charges against a girl, 12. He was charged last year with the sexual assault of 14 children and two adults . When the student refused to take photos of girls in the locker room at the Bristol Township school, he said he was 'done' with her and threatened to send the nude pictures to her friends and her mother. 'That’s the last time you tell me 'no,'' he said in one exchange, according to the news website. In other texts, the man told the teenager: 'You are every guy's fantasy -- getting with a daughter with a hot-ass body.' Meyerle found several of his victims by dating their mothers and offering the children tattoos in exchange for sex, according to reports. His alleged victims include boys and girls, some as young as four years old. The man has been in Bucks County Prison's restricted housing unit on $5 million bail since his arrest last March. He attempted to break out of prison last year.","Walter Meyerle, 35, on trial for nearly 200 twisted sex abuse crimes committed against 15 children over a decade .

Boat passengers caught a glimpse of a rare shark as it was spotted jumping out of the sea in 'shark infested waters' off the Welsh coast. Swimmers and holidaymakers last week rushed for the shore after a blue shark ventured into the shallows on a beach in Wales. Now a thresher shark has been caught on camera in the same stretch of water off the coast of  Ceredigion, mid-wales. Rare species: A thresher shark jumps out of the water off the coast of Wales days after holidaymakers were ordered out of the water following the sighting of a blue shark . An unlikely sight: Boat passengers rushed to catch a glimpse of the 'threatened' species . The giant predator, usually seen in Asia and . North America, shocked boat passengers when it suddenly hurled itself . out of the water in front of the research vessel Sulaire. As well as members of the public being on board the boat, researchers from the Cardigan Bay Marine Wildlife Centre were also conducting an-all day survey. The sighting of the Thresher Shark caused much excitement. Sarah Perry, the marine centre's science officer, . who was on board, said sightings of the sharks had been increasing in . recent years in UK waters. 'Thresher sharks are normally found . in deep waters but can follow their prey closer to the shore so maybe . that’s what this one was doing,' she said. 'Perhaps either it or its prey were attracted by increasing sea temperatures. 'You can recognise thresher sharks by . their long tails - which they use to herd their prey into tight groups . before feeding on them. 'They’re protected as a threatened species - they’re far more at risk from us.' Days before the sighting, red flags were raised on the beach at New Quay, Ceredigion, as a baby blue shark swam between moored boats behind the breakwater. The baby blue shark sparked panic when it was spotted by RNLI lifeguards heading for the shore. The . creature came within yards of the beach and holidaymakers watched in . wonder as it swam past their feet in water less than a metre deep. The . incident, which happened at about 5.30pm last Tuesday, was caught on . camera by 16-year-old, Jasmine Jones, who was on her boat as the curious creature . investigated the shallows, the BBC reported. Holidaymakers were advised not to swim in the water after the shark sighting. However, the beach re-opened on Wednesday. Scroll down for video .

Captured on camera: The blue shark swimming close to the shore . While . the RNLI said it was very unusual to see a blue shark so close to the . shoreline, the species are frequently spotted in waters of the coast of . Wales, Ireland and Cornwall. Miss Perry added: 'It’s actually not unusual to see a blue shark in British waters but they don’t usually come so close to shore. This one was very small and perhaps it was ill.' Thresher sharks are not known as man-eaters, and tend to feed on schools of fish in shallow waters. They use their long scythe like tails, which can make up around half of their total length, to stun prey before they tear at their flesh. Earlier this month fearless angler Malcolm Roberts, 49, was fishing with a group of pals off the coast of Cornwall when he felt a 350lb thresher shark - which could decapitate a human using just its tail - tugging in his line. Monster: Malcolm Roberts with the huge 13ft Thresher shark he caught off the coast of Cornwall. The beast could decapitate a human using just its tail . Big bite: The thresher shark was on sale at Ashton Fishmongers in Cardiff . It took him an hour and a half to haul in a 13ft shark out the water. Mr Roberts and his five-strong crew wrestled with the giant predator before he finally pulled it into his boat. The giant catch, landed around 20 miles off the coast of Looe, Cornwall, was one of the biggest ever caught in British waters. In July a 20ft long thresher shark was caught by the trawler The John Boy, in Falmouth, Cornwall, which was fishing for mackerel in the English Channel. The 550lb beast was bought by Ashton's Fishmongers in Cardiff market for a hefty price of £3,000. A bigeye thresher shark: the thresher shark can grow up to 20ft long . Thresher sharks tend to feed on schools of fish in shallow waters. Their name comes from the sharks' unusually long tail, which can be as long as the shark itself. They use their long scythe like tails, which can make up around half of their total length, to stun prey before they tear at their flesh. An adult beast can grow up to 20ft long. The average weight for a thresher shark is roughly 250lbs but some can weigh as much as 1000lbs. Its body is built almost like a torpedo-shape. There are three species of this shark, a pelagic thresher, a bigeye thresher and a common thresher. The common thresher shark has a small body and broad head with relatively small sets of teeth. Thresher Sharks love open and deep waters but are not generally not found deeper than 1,640ft. They are usually seen in Asia and . North America, but their exact habitat remains largely a mystery.

The man from Chelmsford, Essex denied smuggling the ‘sophisticated concealment’ of drugs but was found guilty and sentenced to 12 years in jail on Friday. The Maidstone Crown Court heard how UK Border Agency officers at Dover’s Eastern Docks searched the lorry and trailer in August last year and found powder in the truck’s roof which tested positive for cocaine. The officers dismantled the truck’s inner roof, finding the drugs hidden between the roof and inner roof. Malcolm Bragg from the UK Border force said: ‘This was a sophisticated drugs concealment and shows the lengths criminals will go to in attempting to evade the UK's border controls. ‘The sentence handed down today should act as a warning to those who attempt to smuggle illegal drugs into this country.’ 'Sophisticated drug concealment': 50lbs of heroin, 22lbs of cocaine and more than 23,000 ecstasy tablets were seized from the truck carrying pickled onions . The heroin was valued as having a potential street price of up to £2.1 million, the cocaine was worth £1.7 million and the ecstasy £71,000. Mr Bragg said: ‘Drug use destroys not only the lives of individual users, but also their families and the wider community.’ Earlier this month, three Welsh men were jailed for three years and eight months each for attempting to import drug cutting agents through the docks. The agents, if mixed with with heroin or amphetamine, could have made an estimated £10 million on the streets. The docks at Dover see at least 2.3 million lorry movements every year.

Mrs Rayner, 27, began collecting Disney memorabilia at the age of three when she bought a Mickey Mouse doll in California. Fanatic: Caroline Rayner, 27, has a collection of more than 400 Disney toys, worth £5,000 . It triggered a lifelong obsession and her favourite toys were even in attendance at the couple's wedding reception. The toys take pride of place in the Rayners' bedroom in Bromley, Kent, and Mr Rayner, 30, has to jostle for room in the bed. Caroline and David Rayner stand next to a Mickey Mouse cake at their Disney-themed wedding reception . Mrs Rayner, a retail sales assistant, . said: 'I brought my first toy almost 24 years ago, a Mickey Mouse doll . from America, and I fell in love with it. 'I was the victim of bullying when I was at secondary school so to make myself feel better I would go out and buy some more toys, and that’s when my collection really began to grow.' Mrs Rayner's collection is worth £5,000 and includes a 4ft toy of Jungle Book character Baloo. Her favourite toy is a Bolt teddy bear. Mrs Rayner was worried that her collection would put off her future husband when she first showed him her bedroom. 'When I first took David back to my house I was worried about what he might think about my collection,' she said. 'I took a deep breath when I opened the door but to my surprise he didn’t seem that bothered. In fact, he actually embraced it.' Mr Rayner now helps his wife of two years expand her collection by scouring local car boot sales and internet site eBay. Mrs . Rayner, a keen artist, added: 'When we went on dates David would treat . me to a Disney toy or figurine instead of bringing flowers or . chocolates. 'I was so relieved that he didn’t mind my collection. He’s often off hunting down little treasures for me now.' Mr Rayner did put his foot down when the couple married in 2010, banning Disney from the wedding ceremony. But Mrs Rayner organised a . Disney-themed reception complete with Disney music, balloons and cake - . and their honeymoon was spent at Disneyland Florida. She said: 'I wasn’t allowed any of my memorabilia at the ceremony but I made sure that the reception had a Disney theme. 'We listened to Disney music and we had some Disney balloons with a cake that had Mickey and Minnie Mouse on. 'Some of my soft toys were even sat on the side at the reception.'

Brutal scene: Zena, 10, suffered horrific injuries after being run over by the biker in front of her owner . A motorcross rider who deliberately ran down and killed an elderly dog in front of her owner is being hunted by police and the RSPCA. The killer accelerated straight at 10-year-old Zena on a heath in Aldershot, Hants, and sent her flying 25ft, causing the German Shepherd terrible injuries. The dog's owner said he feared for his own life as the biker roared towards him during his regular walk on Ministry of Defence-owned heathland. He had even put Zena on a lead for safety after hearing the bike coming, but the motorcyclist mowed straight into her and her heart stopped beating minutes later. Zena’s owner, who did not want to be identified, said: 'It was a nice day and we were in full view with lots of space around us but the man on the bike seemed to stop, look right at me and then he speeded up to around 60 miles per hour and headed flat out towards us. 'I honestly thought I was going to die but instead he hit my beautiful dog. 'As she lay on the ground dying, he carried on riding his bike around and around the area and eventually when I shouted that my dog was dead and then got my camera out to take a picture of the man, he eventually rode off.' The man, who had owned Zena since she was 11 months old, added: 'I have gone over it in my mind.I know he could see us. He even stopped as though he was trying to intimidate me and then he rode at full speed in our direction. 'There was plenty of space for him to swerve or slow down if he wanted. It was no accident. 'I cannot even imagine what would cause anyone to behave in such a way and I am stunned, I have lost my companion and my friend. She was such a lovely dog.' The man managed to take some pictures during the shocking incident last Thursday, which the RSPCA hope will help trap the killer. The pair were at a site known as Caesar’s Camp, which is used for military exercises by the MoD and is also open to the public. Killer: The shocked owner managed to capture this picture of the motorcyclist, who sped off after deliberately mowing down his dog . Over the years there has been trouble with illegal motorcyclists at the spot, which is popular with dog walkers, joggers and other nature lovers, although parts of the site have been used to host official motorcross competitions. A spokesman for the RSPCA said: 'Although the biker appeared to stop in the distance and stare right at the dog walker, who was in plain sight, he still headed his vehicle straight towards him.' RSPCA chief inspector Dave Fox said: 'Doing this job you get used to all manner of cruel things being done to animals but I can honestly say that this unbelievable act of cruelty is one of the worst I have seen. 'Not only did it cause no end of suffering to a much-loved pet but what the poor owner went through is horrendous.' The biker never removed his helmet but from his frame and the way he was dressed, investigators suspect he is young. The bike he was riding was a KTM EXC/Super Moto, which is a road legal bike, unlike a normal Moto Cross bike, as it was fitted with lights and indicators. Under the Animal Welfare Act, anyone found guilty of causing deliberate suffering to an animal faces up to six months in prison and/or a £20,000 fine. Anyone with information on the incident or who recognises the biker or description of the motorbike is asked to contact Ministry of Defence Police, Hampshire Police or the RSPCA.","Dog owner said he feared for his life as motorcyclist sped towards them .

The brother of Moors Murders victim Keith Bennett has described Ian Brady’s confidante as ‘sick’ and ‘twisted’ following allegations that she concealed a letter that may reveal the whereabouts of the 12-year-old’s remains. Alan Bennett said the killer’s self-styled mental health advocate Jackie Powell had ‘a very empty soul, just like Brady’ and ought to be locked up with him. Mr Bennett, 52, was speaking after the broadcast of a Channel 4 documentary in which Miss Powell, 48, described being given a sealed envelope by Brady addressed to Keith and Alan’s mother, Winnie Johnson, who died at the weekend. 'Sick and twisted': Alan Bennett (left), the brother of Moors Murder victim Keith has spoken out over claims that Ian Brady's confidante Jackie Powell (right) concealed a letter that may reveal the location of the 12-year-old's body . Mrs Johnson had dedicated her life to finding where Brady and Myra Hindley buried her son, who vanished in 1964. He is the only one of the pair’s five victims whose body has not been found. Last week, police responded to publicity about the documentary by raiding Miss Powell’s home and arresting her on suspicion of preventing the lawful burial of a body. No letter was found. Miss Powell disclosed its existence while being interviewed for the documentary, Endgames of a Psychopath, which was shown on Monday. Mr Bennett branded her ‘nothing more than another sick friend to Brady’, adding on his website: ‘Jackie Powell, you are . . . a self-important, callous twisted individual with no heart and a very empty soul, just like Brady.’ Tragic: Keith's mother Winnie on Saddleworth Moor, where her son is believed to be buried. She died at the weekend without ever knowing the truth . He said Miss Powell and former religious studies teacher Dr Alan Keighley, another Brady confidant interviewed in the film, ‘should be in Ashworth [the secure hospital where Brady is held] themselves’. Miss Powell was unavailable for comment yesterday. She has claimed that she told police about Brady’s letter two weeks before her arrest, but officers from the cold case unit were not interested. ‘It is no surprise at all that Brady was/is willing to sit and talk to the likes of these people,’ he wrote. ‘They should be in Ashworth themselves or some other institution to try and help with their problems, although they may well be beyond any help at all.’ And he concluded: ‘Powell and Keighley you are both a total and utter disgrace. ‘You sicken and disgust me more than I could ever say, just like the rest of the Brady’s sympathisers and friends.’ Killer': Brady (left) has always refused to reveal where Keith's remains are buried . Mr Bennett backed the decision to broadcast the film so soon after his mother’s death and said it had demonstrated how Brady had ‘conned’ so many people during his long incarceration. At the weekend he criticised Greater Manchester Police’s refusal to relaunch the hunt for his brother’s remains, branding their vow to resume the search if they received significant new information ‘pointless platitudes’. Meanwhile Action for Advocacy - which provides support for mental health advocates - said Miss Powell’s conduct breached its guidelines. Chief executive Martin Coyle said Ashworth had questions to answer about the level of access to Brady she had been given for the past 13 years and how she was apparently able to smuggle a letter out. He added that her role as an executor of Brady’s will represented ‘a big conflict of interest’. ‘Either she had a formal role, which would involve someone supervising her, and which apparently didn’t happen, or she’d be better described as a long-term visitor or friend,’ he said. Mr Coyle criticised Channel 4 for not querying her claim to be Brady’s formal mental health advocate, saying her behaviour ‘tarnished’ the reputation of thousands of well-intentioned professionals. The health of 74-year-old Brady is reported to be fading after 13 years on hunger strike, with injuries he sustained after a seizure at the secure hospital in Merseyside last month meaning he is now too ill to be force-fed. Keith was on his way to visit his grandmother’s house in Longsight, Manchester when he vanished on June 16, 1964. His mother died at a hospice on Saturday after a long battle with cancer without being informed of the latest developments in the hunt for his body. Miss Powell was unavailable for comment yesterday. She has previously alleged that she told police about Brady’s letter two weeks before her arrest but officers from the cold case unit were not interested.

A diver has lost his life after losing his air supply 150ft underwater while exploring the wreck of a German U-boat. Rescue boat crew tried to resuscitate Ian Woolston for 30 minutes who was then taken by a rescue helicopter and . raced to a pressure chamber in Dundee but could not be saved. Mr Woolston, from Halifax, West Yorkshire, lost his air supply . 150ft down and may have suffered a fatal case of the bends as he was . sent to the surface to avoid drowning. Decompression illness - otherwise known . as the 'bends' - is when small gas bubbles form in the blood as a diver . rises to the surface, blocking circulation to the brain. The diver was seen frantically signalling to his dive partner that he was returning to the surface. His partner then tried to help him upwards as he pushed him towards the surface. Mr Woolston was part of a seven-strong expedition visiting the remains of a U-boat . which was sunk almost 100 years ago with the loss of 19 lives. On . his Facebook page the keen diver was excited by the trip after having a . previous expedition cancelled and had been posting about his up and . coming adventure. He wrote: 'Another dive trip cancelled due to the weather. Bollox.'We were going to Eyemouth to do the Exmouth, we are still on for tomorrow though to do the U12. 'I need to get to Divers today and get an 80 per cent fill in my stage, I was going to get it up there.' The U12, which was destroyed by the . Royal Navy 25 miles off the coast of Eyemouth, Berwickshire, in 1915, is . one of at least four submarine-wrecks which regularly attract diving . expeditions. But the wrecks . are in such deep water it can take divers on a 60-minute trip up to . half an hour to come to the surface to avoid the bends. Gary Fairbairn, the coxswain of Dunbar lifeboat, said: 'We were responding to a mayday from the Eyemouth dive boat Jacob George. ''One of a party of seven divers exploring the wreck of a German U Boat had lost his air supply on the seabed. Keen diver: Ian Woolston lost his air supply . 150ft down and may have suffered a fatal case of the bends as he was . sent to the surface to avoid drowning . 'His dive buddy sent him up to the surface but he was unconscious. 'We were about an hour away and as we were about three miles from the casualty a rescue helicopter from RAF Boulmer arrived on scene and winched the diver a board and rushed him to Ninewellls Hospital in Dundee but very sadly he was dead.' The Dunbar lifeboat took the Mr Woolston’s dive buddy back to Eyemouth suffering from shock where he was examined by medics. A rescue insider said: 'He was at a depth of about 47m (154ft). The diver was still attached to the shot line [safety rope] and floated up while still attached to it.' Deadly: This black and white photograph shows U 12 before it was sunk off the coast of Scotland . The casualty was taken to Ninewells . Hospital, Dundee, which has a hyperbaric chamber - a facility which can . save the lives of bends victims by artificially creating pressure and . then slowly reducing it. The trip was organised by Eyemouth-based diving company Marine Quest. They confirmed the dead diver was on their trip but declined to comment further. Jim MacLeod, part of the 2008 research team which discovered U12, said the trip should not have posed any unusual dangers. Mr MacLeod, who dived on the wreck . himself, said: 'It’s not a hazardous dive. It’s at a depth of 48m and is . on an open sand bed - there’s nothing overly dangerous down there.' He suggested the bends - the forming of nitrogen bubbles in the blood caused by pressure - may have caused the man’s death. 'If you’re diving for an hour, . depending on equipment and oxygen levels, you can complete it in 20 . minutes, leaving you with half an hour to return to the surface. Resting place: The wreck of U12 was discovered by a dive team in September 2008 . 'But . if you’re down for only five minutes then you can get away with coming . up quicker - it all depends on how long you’re diving for, your depth . and the oxygen you have with you. 'It’s a shame this diver died as result of his trip. A trawler spotted U12 early on the morning of the 10th March 1915 east of Fife Ness. Three British warships, the Acheron, the Attack and the Ariel, were sent to track it down and engage it. The Ariel spotted the periscope of the vessel submerged just under the surface - ramming it at full speed. The rusted remains of the U12 and her crew remained undiscovered for 93 years. For many years numerous locations for the wreck had been reported. All proved fruitless. Finally, after a five year search, the U12 was rediscovered off the coast of Scotland 25 miles east of Eyemouth following a detailed study of contemporary records of the battle. In January 2008 a dive was organised to explore the location which was discovered. 'Marine Quest are a popular company and those in charge really know their stuff.' The U12 - a 60m-long submarine - was . attacked and sunk by three Royal Navy destroyers on 10 March 1915 as it . targeted cargo ships on the east coast. Ten crew survived. At least three other wrecked German submarines lie on the seabed off the east coast of Scotland. Around . 100 submariners perished aboard U714, U40 and UC41, which were . targeting supply ships making their way out the Firth of Forth. Lothian and Borders Police have launched an investigation into the man’s death. A . police spokesman said: 'Lothian and Borders Police are investigating . the sudden death of a man in his fifties after he took ill during a . diving trip, which set off from Eyemouth, Scottish Borders. 'The man was taken to Ninewells Hospital after members of his group raised the alarm around 2.30pm on Sunday 19th August. 'However, . despite the best efforts of medical staff, he later passed away.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter and Associated Press Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 00:32 EST, 23 August 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 06:03 EST, 23 August 2012 . Ramzi Yousef, who planned and carried out the 1993 bombing of the World Trade Center that killed six people and injured 1,000 others, has been held in isolation for more than a decade. The 44-year-old Pakistani national has been held in solitary confinement in a 7-foot-by-11-foot cell at the federal Supermax prison Colorado since the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. But he is now asking to be let out of solitary - because he's 'lonely'. Despite the World Trade Center attack, a bombing of a Thai airliner, a plot to kill the Pope and a string of other plots -- Yousef's lawyer now claims that his client is 'no longer a threat.' Terrorist: Ramzi Yousef bragged that he was a terrorist at his sentencing in 1998. Now he says he's lonely . Damage: This is the hole that was blown in the basement of the World Trade Center by the truck bomb Yousef detonated . Attorney Bernard Kleinman wants the 2nd US Circuit Court of Appeals in Manhattan to let him gather facts from prosecutors about why Ramzi Yousef remains held under the strictest security measures 15 years after they were first imposed. The three-judge panel did not immediately rule. 'I think it's just plain unfair,' Kleinman said outside court. 'Most of the terrorists he knew are either dead or in jail.' Yousef was sentenced to life in prison after he was convicted in the February 1993 attack that killed six people and injured hundreds of others and in a plot to bomb 12 American airliners over the Far East. He fled to the Middle East the night of the bombing and was captured two years later in Pakistan, where he was turned over to the FBI. He now lives in a 7-foot by 11-foot cell with a radio, a television, a desk, a toilet and a shower, Kleinman said. Since 1997, he has been subjected to special administrative measures reserved for prisoners who are believed to be a continuing threat to the country. Kleinman said he is challenging the grounds under which the government continues to impose the severe restrictions on Yousef. Catastrophic: Yousef had hoped the bomb blast would collapse the one tower into the other and bring both crumbling down . Wounded: More than 1,000 people were injured in the World Trade Center attack . The restrictions prevent Yousef from communicating with other prisoners and only allow him to meet with his lawyer, Kleinman said. For those visits, the last of which occurred in October 2010, Yousef is shackled and forced to communicate through Plexiglass. Yousef is a nephew of Khalid Sheik Mohammed, who has conceded in a written statement that he directed the Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks. Kleinman said Yousef's prison conditions were tightened even more after the September 11 attacks so that he was no longer housed near notorious criminals including Unabomber Ted Kaczynski and Oklahoma City bombing conspirators Terry Nichols and Timothy McVeigh. McVeigh was executed while Nichols is serving life in prison. At his 1998 sentencing, Yousef defiantly proclaimed: 'Yes, I am a terrorist and am proud of it.' Kleinman said he knows his client is 'not a sympathetic character' and that there are 'legitimate hard feelings against him.' But he added that he hopes to eventually get the severe prison conditions loosened so that Yousef can have fewer restrictions on his communications with family, including his wife and two daughters. 'The human interaction is really a big issue for him,' Kleinman said. 'He recognizes he'll be in jail the rest of his life.'","Ramzi Yousef was the mastermind of the terrorist attack that killed six people and injured 1,000 others .

A film producer on a flight bound for Los Angeles has given a blow-by-blow account of how an unruly passenger forced the plane to make an unscheduled landing in Denver. Cassian Elwes took to Twitter to reveal the ordeal suffered by passengers on Flight 677 when a man, identified only as an ex-Marine called Marco from Queens, New York, began behaving in an aggressive and erratic manner. Drinking heavily and swallowing pills, the veteran abused passengers with threatening language, stumbled around the plane and sexually assaulted a pregnant woman, it is claimed. The trouble began when the British filmmaker boarded the JetBlue Airways flight in New York on Sunday evening and found a man wearing a hooded top sitting in his window seat. Scroll down for video . Arrest: An unruly passenger who forced a New York to Los Angeles flight to make an emergency landing is led away by Denver police in the early hours of yesterday morning . Intoxicated: The ex-Marine was drinking heavily and swallowing pills taken by people with bipolar disorder, according to tweets made by film producer Cassian Elwes, who was sat next to him . In the first of 60 tweets, Mr Elwes said: . 'When I got on the plane I went to my seat 20f a window seat I had . specifically booked. There was someone sitting already in my seat. 'A youngish looking guy maybe late 20s (turned out he was 32) quite burly white crew cut lots of tattoos. Gang looking maybe. 'Hey that's my seat man I said. A . quick drawling f*** you its mine now was the response I sat down next to . him mumbling ""charming"".' Fodder for his next script: Mr Elwes, a British movie producer, posted 60 tweets on the prolonged incident after landing in Los Angeles . Mr Elwes, who has worked on films . including Margin Call, Blue Valentine and Lawless, said that Marco's . bizarre behaviour rapidly escalated over the next three hours. At one point he tore up a magazine, licked the pieces and stuck them to a television monitor in front of his seat. He also stumbled up and down the plane and is said to have groped a pregnant woman. Describing one walk around, Mr Elwes said: 'This time he walks to the front. I feel uneasy and I go . back & tell one of the ladies that he's acting weird. 'And I'm really not sure that it's a good idea that he's hanging around the front where all the buttons are for the doors.' Marco's verbal abuse and intoxicated . demeanour eventually became so threatening that an off-duty air marshal . was forced to sit next to him and the flight was diverted to Denver . International Airport. The . air marshal and Marco exchanged words, until, as Elwes tweeted: 'Hoodie . tries to get up but air marshal blocks him. More f*** yous. 'Hoodie throws his vodka at him but it lands on the couple in front of him.' It . was then that Mr Elwes, who had moved his seat earlier in the flight to . get away from Marco, volunteered to again sit next to the ex-Marine, . telling him, 'Let's talk let's just talk.'

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 20:37 EST, 23 August 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 23:12 EST, 23 August 2012 . Scientists discovered that ink diluted with bacteria-tainted water is to blame for more than four dozen cases involving infected tattoos that have been reported in at least four states. According to researchers, the largest cluster of cases was in Rochester, New York, where 19 people ended up with bubbly rashes on their new tattoos which they got from the same artist. The investigation into the outbreak started last fall when a 19-year-old man from upstate New York got a stubborn rash that would not go away. Nasty bug: A common bacteria fond in distilled water can cause itchy and painful pus-filled blisters that can take months to clear up . Tests showed that the infection was caused by a distant bacterial relative of tuberculosis called Mycobacterium chelonae. While not life-threatening, the bacteria can cause itchy and painful pus-filled blisters that can take four months or longer to clear up, and involve treatment with harsh antibiotics with unpleasant side effects. In some cases, it is necessary to remove the entire area of the skin affected by the bacteria, which could leave a large scar. Infections from body art are nothing . new. Hepatitis, staph infections and even the superbug known as MRSA . have been tied to tattoos. Dirty needles and unsanitary conditions are . often to blame. Culprit: Bacteria called Mycobacterium chelonae was detected in non-sterile water used to dilute tattoo ink . Source of outbreak: A tattoo artist from upstate New York said he bought the ink linked to the infection at a large trade show in Arizona . But in all the New York cases, the . tattoo artist wore disposable gloves and sterilized his instruments. The . problem, investigators concluded, was in the ink, which the Rochester . artist bought at large trade show in Arizona, according to NBC. ‘Even . if you get a tattoo from a facility that does everything right, it's . not risk free,’ said Dr Byron Kennedy, deputy director of the health . department in New York's Monroe County. He is lead author of a report on last fall's Rochester cases was released by the New England Journal of Medicine on Wednesday. In the past year, there have been 22 . confirmed cases and more than 30 suspected cases of the skin infection . in Colorado, Iowa, New York and Washington state, health officials said. The infections were tied to ink or non-sterile water used to dilute the ink, according to health officials. Outbreak: The largest cluster of tattoo infections was found in Rochester, New York, where 19 people who went to the same artist caught the bug . Scattered reports of the illness in tattoo customers have been reported over the past 10 years. But they may be growing more common as more people get tattoos, experts said. An estimated 21 per cent of U.S. adults have at least one tattoo, according to polls. The bacteria are common in tap water, and have been seen in the past when tattoo artists used contaminated water to lighten dark ink. The ink used in New York was ‘gray wash,’ which can make a tattoo resemble a photograph. The ink was since recalled and has not returned to the market. Makers of 'gray wash' ink sometimes . use distilled water to lighten the ink, thinking it's clean of . infection-causing contaminants. But the bacteria can live in that too, . said Tara MacCannell, who led a related investigation by the Centers for . Disease Control and Prevention. Her study appears in CDC's Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report released on Wednesday. Special effect: The ink used in Rochester was 'gray wash,' which can make a tattoo resemble a photograph . Complications: It takes a cocktail of antibiotics to treat the infection caused by the Mycobacterium chelonae bacteria, and sometimes it even requires removing skin . Some ink manufacturers add witch hazel or an alcohol preservative to lower risk of certain viruses, but the hardy chelonae bacteria are resistant to disinfectants, she added. Investigators found the bacteria in opened and unopened bottles of ink at the New York tattoo parlor. They did not find it in water at the shop, meaning that the artist was not the one who diluted the ink, MacCannell said. Health officials say tattoo customers should ask what kind of ink is being used and what measures are in place to prevent infections.","Infections were traced to bacteria called Mycobacterium chelonae .

Britain's deepest double-dip recession for more than 50 years is not quite as bad as previously feared, official figures have revealed. The Office for National Statistics has revised its Gross Domestic Product figures upwards, showing a smaller contraction in the economy between April and June this year. GDP fell 0.5 per cent in three months after a second estimate today, which is better than the initial 0.7 per cent drop that shocked the City last month. The figures show the extra bank . holiday for the Queen's Diamond Jubilee did not have as much of an effect on spending. Poor: The economy shrank by 0.5% in quarter two this year, but it is still bad news for the Chancellor . But despite the upward revision, it still represents the biggest quarter-on-quarter fall for more than three years and means the economy remains mired in the longest double-dip recession since the 1950s. Smaller than previously thought falls in the production and . construction sectors drove the figure higher, while the powerhouse . services sector was unrevised, with a 0.1% fall. Figures released today showed the UK's trade deficit increased to . £7.3 billion, up from £3.7 billion in the previous quarter as the . eurozone debt crisis hit exports - its biggest fall since the third . quarter of 2010, which wiped 1% off the GDP figure. Business investment also fell for the first time for more than a year. Pressure: George Osborne's management of the economy is still be questioned after the revision . The economy is now 0.1 per cent . smaller than when the Coalition came to power in 2010, with national . output still 4.3 per cent below the pre-crisis peak of 2008. After the Great Depression, by this stage the economy had already surpassed the pre-crash percentage. Analysts . have branded the figures a ‘disaster’ and warned that the economy . will grow this year by far less than the 0.8 per cent expected by the . Treasury – if at all. The improved GDP figures will not to ease the pressure on Chancellor George Osborne who came under fresh fire to boost the economy last week when figures showed a shock increase in public sector borrowing in July. A spokesman for the Treasury said: 'Britain is dealing with some very deep-rooted problems at home and a very serious debt crisis abroad, and that is why the healing of the economy is proving to be a slow and difficult process. 'Compared to two years ago, the deficit is down, inflation is down, and there are more private sector jobs.'The Government will continue to give its undivided attention to the economy - for example with recent announcements on infrastructure and lending.' The fall in production was revised up from minus 1.3% to minus 0.9%, while the ONS said construction fell 3.9% rather than 5.2% as previously estimated. Economists believe the extra bank holiday may have knocked as much as 0.5% off GDP, but the ONS said it was too early to measure the effect. The services sector was not revised higher despite a better than previously thought 0.8% uplift in retail sales in June. In another grim sign for the high street, household spending decreased 0.4% in the second quarter, despite falling inflation easing the pressure on consumers. There are fears that the economy will struggle to pull out of its double-dip recession in the current quarter as the eurozone debt crisis slows global growth. Vicky Redwood, chief UK economist at Capital Economics, said: 'UK GDP was revised up in Q2 as expected, but the revision is very small in the big picture and means that output is still more than 4% below its pre-recession peak. 'Of course, the GDP figures may in the future be revised up further. 'Nonetheless, given the drags from the fiscal squeeze, eurozone crisis and high domestic debt levels, we still doubt that a strong recovery lies ahead.'","Previous estimate said it shrank by 0.7% between April and June, but this was changed to 0.5% today .

After spending millions of dollars trying to find a new type of scanner that would allow travelers to keep their shoes on while going through airport security, the U.S. government decided to leave things as they are. The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) said it had rejected all four devices that were under consideration because they failed to detect all the explosive devices and metal weapons that were hidden in footwear during tests. The news comes less than a year after Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano had announced that the TSA is well on its way to develop and put in place new scanning machines that would allow passengers to remain shod, thus cutting down on long lines and complaints. Dashed hopes: The TSA had rejected all four scanning devices that were being tested because they failed to detect all the weapons hidden in footwear . But now the TSA says that it is not any closer to solving the security scanner problem, the New York Times reported. The policy requiring passengers to take off their footwear was instituted after Richard Reid tried unsuccessfully to detonate an explosive device concealed in his shoes on a flight from Paris to Miami in 2001. Over the years, the government has made attempts to improve airport security procedures, allowing elderly travelers and children to keep their shoes on when going through airport screening. In another move to streamline the . process, the TSA put in place the PreCheck program in about 20 domestic . airports where travelers willing to submit themselves to a security . screening may go through checkpoints without having to remove any . clothing or part with their laptops. Pet peeve: Passengers say they hate taking off their shoes more than pat-downs and full-body scans . While the introduction of full-body scanners to airports around the U.S. has been a controversial move, with critics raising a host of concerns ranging from radiation to privacy, no part of airport security has drawn more ire from travelers than removing their footwear. According to the U.S. Travel . Association, a Washington-based trade group, passengers say they hate . taking off their shoes more than pat-downs and full-body scans. Shoe bomber: The shoe-removal policy was put in place after Richard Reid, pictured, attempted to detonate an explosive device hidden in his footwear on a plane in 2001 . TSA officials are aware that standing security procedures related to the removal of clothing are widely detested by travelers and in no small part contribute to longer lines at checkpoints. In 2007, the agency tested a General Electric shoe scanner at Orlando International Airport. The following year, it tested two devices made by L3 Communications at Los Angeles’ LAX, but none of them had earned the TSA’s stamp of approval. Another scanning machine that was under consideration was Magshoe, which is manufactured by an Israeli firm. The device, which is meant to detect metal, has been depplyed in hundreds of airports and cruise ships around the world, including in China, Italy and Israel. Michael Goldberg, the company’s president, told The Times the contraption can detect bombs containing metal, but not plastic explosives. The government has a $1.4million contract with Morpho Detection, a subsidiary of the French defense giant Safran, to develop a shoe-scanning machine. Morpho’s device can detect chemical . compounds and metal objects, said Brad Buswell, the president of Morpho . and a former Homeland Security official, who added that the TSa will be . testing a rotoyp of the machine this year. . High-tech machine: The Magshoe, made by an Israeli firm, can detect explosives that contain metals, but not plastic . Many security experts believe that the TSA should abandon its current approach that hinges on finding weapons in shoes and bags and focus instead on detecting the people who may be planning to carry out an attack. In Israel, security officials are trained to quickly determine whether a passenger may pose a threat by conducting an interview with him or her. But critics believe that in the U.S., where some 803 million travelers passed through airports last year alone, such an approach would be futile and may open the door on racial profiling.","TSA said four scanners failed to detect all weapons hidden in shoes during tests .

A mobile DNA testing facility ensconced in an jury-rigged Winnebago has been cruising New York City of late, picking up street hails as if it were a taxi and offering on-the-spot DNA testing. The owner of the R.V. - or as he calls it, a mobile medical facility - says he caters to family cases like long-lost sisters. But Health Street doesn't really make any bones about who it's really pitching, cheekily emblazoning the question, 'Who's Your Daddy? on the vehicle's side. Scroll Down for Video . Who's Your Daddy?: Mobile facility is ensconced in a jury-rigged, blue-and-brown Winnebago that is cheekily emblazoned with the question, 'Who's Your Daddy?' on its side . The clinic started in . 2010 but was revamped two months ago. The facility, owned by Health Street, which was founded by Jared Rosenthal (pictured), caters to a variety of clients, including returning soldiers who want to confirm the paternity of newly-born babies . Indeed, the 28-foot brown-and-blue R.V. looks more like a mobile home than a medical facility, but the interior does provide the service it promises, starting at $299. 'It's just such a serious, fundamental question ... who are your children? Who are your parents?' Jared Rosenthal, the founder of Health Street, told Reuters. Rosenthal also drives the R.V., stopping much like a taxi cab for passersby who hail it on the street for impromptu paternity tests. One New Yorker, who declined to give his name discovered he was the dad of a long-lost daughter he had fathered with a woman he had dated some 20 years ago. The 44-year-old married father of two - make that now three - confirmed the paternity in July. 'This issue is still raw and very sensitive,' he said. 'I will get to . know my daughter ... this is something I'm taking one day at a time.' Inside the facility, technicians take DNA samples, which are then packaged and shipped off to an Ohio  laboratory. Results are returned three to five business days later. Mandatory prescriptions from a physician can be faxed via the Internet to waiting techs. Experts say there has been a steady . increase in demand for such tests in the U.S., reaching close to 500,000 . a year - in part to the uptick in  births to unmarried women. Rosenthal's mobile DNA-testing facility is ensconced in a brown-and-blue improvised Winnebago that makes no bones about its mission . Cruisin': Much like a taxi, the mobile DNA-testing unit will stop for street hails from passersby who want an on-the-spot DNA test to confirm paternity and whatnot . In 2010, at least 382,199 so-called 'relationship tests' were conducted in the U.S., although the total is likely much higher because some labs don't submit data, according to the AABB,, which accredits 'relationship testing' facilities. State child-support agencies make up the bulk of this demand, but experts said the number of people simply seeking answers has dramatically increased. 'It's just such a serious, fundamental question ... who are your children? Who are your parents?' 'The bigger question is what do we do with this information. Why are we looking for it and what do we think it means?' said Susan Crockin, a lawyer who teaches at Georgetown Law Center and specializes in reproductive technology. 'The underlying issues are obviously the quality of testing,' Crockin said. Typical Health Street customers include engaged men who want to confirm offspring from a past relationship, returning soldiers seeking reassurance they fathered newly-born children, and women inquiring about the paternity of their children. So far, Rosenthal said, two women learned they were half-sisters, and a man whose . suspicion that he might be the father of a friend's daughter was . confirmed. Inside the facility, technicians take DNA samples, which are then packaged and shipped off to an Ohio laboratory. Results are returned three to five business days later . However, the door is open to heartbreak, especially when men discover that somebody else fathered their children. 'If you're really happy with the children in your life, don't go near these things,' Bishai said David . Bishai, a professor at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public . Health. Rosenthal's experiment is by no means groundbreaking - it's fairly common, said experts, for DNA testing labs to offer mobile collection services. However, his mobile facility may be the first to splash the phrase, 'DNA TESTING' in bold red lettering on its side. Health experts advise customers to only use labs accredited by AABB or distributors who use those labs, but there are no regulations on the outfits themselves. It is also not illegal to run a DNA testing laboratory that is not AABB-certified.

Alternate lifestyle: Prosecutors say Louis Ray Perez led a bondage sex ring and was active in playing out violent sex fantasies with his two lovers . Suspects: Prosecutors say Dorothy Maraglino (left) and Jessica Lynn Lopez (right) were part of a bondage sex ring and helped to torture and murder Killgore . Previous media accounts have suggested Mrs Killgore might have somehow been involved in the bondage fetishes of Perez, Maraglino and Lopez. However, prosecutors now say she was tricked into getting into a car with Perez an then abducted, the San Diego Union-Tribune reports. 'Based on my training, experience and investigation, I believe that Perez, Maraglino and Lopez were involved in sexual behavior which included bondage, torture, and master, servant and slave role playing,' court documents say. Three days before her murder, Mrs Killgore had filed for divorce from U.S. Marine Lance Corporal Cory Killgore, who was deployed to Afghanistan. The couple moved from their hometown in rural Missouri to San Diego when Corporal Killgore was stationed at nearby Camp Pendleton. Prosecutors say she had packed up her belonging was was preparing to move out of state when Perez, 46, came to her door on April 13 and asked her to go on a dinner cruise with him, the Union-Tribune reported.

Fears: Cory, right, returned from Afghanistan after hearing about the disappearance of his wife, left . Missing: Brittany Killgore lived in Fallbrook, California, not far from Camp Pendleton US Marine base . Newly unsealed documents listed numerous bondage objects seized as evidence from the house of Louis Perez, Dorothy Maraglino and  Jessica Lynn Lopez. A partial list follows:, . She had met Perez, who is a Marine Staff Sargent, previously when she accompanied her friend to his house to pick up something she had bought online. Killgore turned down Perez's offer. However, later in the day, she sent him a text message asking if she knew anyone who could help her move. 'Party with me tonight & you’ll have five guys there in the morning,' he replied. She agreed. Perez went to her apartment and picked her up -- promising him a night out with her and Maraglino on a dinner cruise. She never made it to the cruise. Just 13 minutes into the car ride, she sent a friend a desperate text message: 'Help.' Prosecutors say Perez then turned off her phone. Authorities believe Killgore was taken to Perez's house, where he summoned Maraglino and Lopez to participate in bondage torture. Following the torture, she was strangled to death and her naked body dumped in a ditch, where she was found four days later. Previously, Perez had bragged on an online bondage group that same day Killgore disappeared that he was he was planning to have a bondage session that weekend. Police seized a host of bondage equipment from Perez's house during a search. The included: nylon rope with hairs on it, and open container of latex gloves. Rope/pulley system in plastic bag, two saws, a stun gun, a baton and several rolls of tape.","Brittany Killgore, 22, was found naked and dismembered in a ditch in April .

The ex-wife of former Dallas Cowboys quarterback Troy Aikman was yesterday arrested and charged with being drunk in public. Rhonda Aikman, 43, who last year divorced the three-time Super Bowl winner after a ten-year marriage, was released from jail the same day on a $269 bond. She was taken to Collin County Jail after appearing to be drunk near Plano, Texas, and her car was towed to a pound, according to TMZ. Mug shot: Rhonda Aikman in a police booking photo after being arrested . The mother-of-three was charged with public intoxication, but police have not revealed any more details about her arrest. It comes 16 months after Mrs Aikman, who is a cast member of the upcoming Bravo TV reality show The Real Housewives of Dallas, quietly divorced her 45-year-old husband. Following an agreement last April the former Dallas Cowboys publicist was paid a $1.75million chunk of Mr Aikman’s $25million fortune he accrued after his football career ended in 2001. They announced they were separating in January last year but did not reveal what was behind their decision, saying only that they ‘remain deeply committed to our children’ They reportedly began dividing their property between them months before they officially split. During their marriage: Rhonda and Troy Aikman pictured together in 2005 . The couple had wed in 2001, months after Mr Aikman retired from his highly successful 12-year career with the Cowboys. Mrs Aikman, who had one child from a previous marriage, had two daughters with Mr Aikman – Jordan, 11, and ten-year-old Alexa. Mr Aikman, who works as a TV commentator for Fox Sports and also co-owns the San Diego Padres baseball team, is considered by many experts as one of the finest quarterbacks of all time. Despite being a promising ball player during his teenage years in West Covina, California, he rejected an offer to sign for the New York Mets. Instead he joined the University of Oklahoma’s football squad in 1984 and embarked on a journey that would later see him being inducted into both the college and NFL halls of fame. However, his first season ended badly when he broke his ankle during a game. Legend: Troy with Dallas Cowboys head coach Chan Gailey, left, in 1998 . After sitting out most of the National Championship-winning 1985 season, he transferred to UCLA. He led the Bruins to the 1987 Aloha Bowl, won the Davey O’Brien Award as the nation’s top college quarterback in 1988 and helped his side achieve a 17-3 victory over the Arkansas Razorbacks in the 1989 Cotton Bowl Classic in Dallas. After the game, the Cowboys snapped him up as the Number 1 NFL draft for the 1989 season. In the 1992 playoffs, he broke Joe Montana's passing record to help Dallas first get into and then win the team’s first Super Bowl since 1977. He helped the Cowboys win the NFL championship again in 1993 and 1995. His career ended after suffering a string of injuries, including ten concussions.","Rhonda Aikman, 43, arrested and has car impounded .

Investigated: Ledford High School drama teacher Bob Dye was suspended with pay for handing out a survey to his students containing racy questions . A high school teacher in Thomasville, North Carolina, has found himself in hot water after parents said he handed out a survey to students on the first day of class asking them racy questions about their sex life. Ledford High School drama teacher Bob Dye wrote the two-page, 50-question survey for a theater arts class which included a section under the heading ‘sex.’ Parent Mike Shore said he was outraged when his 15-year-old daughter brought the questionnaire home from school this week. ‘I’m just super paranoid about stuff like that,’ Shore told WGHP. The parent explained that his daughter was reading the questions out loud while going over the survey when he heard something that piqued his interest. The two-page survey starts out with innocuous questions like ‘Do you consider yourself and extrovert or introvert?’ But towards the end of the questionnaire comes the five-question section labelled ‘sex.’ Among the racy questions the students were asked to answer were: ‘What form of seduction do you like the most?’ and ‘What's the most sensual or sexual part about you?’ Veteran teacher: Dye has worked at Ledford High School in Thomasville, North Carolina, since 2005 and headed a youth summer theater program . Risque: Students at Mr Dye's theater arts class came home on the first day of school with a two-page survey which included a section labeled 'sex' Misunderstanding: A member of a Facebook group created in support of Dye said that the teacher said that students were not obligated to answer the sex questions . Shore said that the questions are just too personal to be asked in any class, even sexual education. ‘I just really didn’t think these were appropriate questions for a child to be answering,’ he said, adding that if he were to ask a child on the street something of that nature, he would be either shot or hauled off to jail. Concerned dad: Mike Shore said he was outraged when he discovered that the survey his 15-year-old daughter received from her teacher contained personal questions about sex . Davidson County School District Public Information Director Donna Stafford told the Daily Mail in a phone interview on Thursday that Dye has been suspended with pay beginning August 29 for the purpose of an investigation. Dye, 58, has worked at Ledford since August of 2005, according to the school district spokesperson. Beside teaching drama at the school, Dye is also the director of the Davidson County Youth Summer Theater Program, which has staged student productions of Godspell, Disney's The Jungle Boo, and the Wizard of Oz. Since his suspension, parents and students created a Facebook group in support of the popular teacher called Team Dye. Members of the online community called the 58-year-old man a role model and an inspiring figure. Some commenters on the page have blamed the 15-year-old student for taking the survey out of context and going to the media. One person went further, saying that the girl fell asleep in class and therefore did not hear that Dye told the students that they were not obligated to answer the sex-related questions. It remains unknown how many students were given the survey. Shore said his daughter dropped the class after the first day.","Theater arts teacher Bob Dye, 58, has been suspended with pay .

Unveiling a new campaign speech, Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney vowed Saturday to lead America to a 'winning season' and insisted that his party would stick to the promises of fiscal responsibility that it had abandoned in the past. 'We're going to finally have to do something that Republicans have spoken about for a long time, and for a while we didn't do it. When we had the lead, we let people down,' Romney told a roaring crowd in Ohio as House Speaker John Boehner, a longtime congressional leader, stood behind him. 'We need to make sure we don't let them down this time. I will cut the deficit and get us on track to a balanced budget.' Man with a plan: Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney speaks at a campaign event on Saturday where he said it was 'winning season again' Stumping: Romney spoke at a campaign rally at Jacksonville Landing in downtown Jacksonville, Florida . Warm welcome: Romney greets supporters during a campaign rally on today . Behind every great woman: Ann Romney addresses crowds today. Mrs Romney has been a key part of his campaign . The former Massachusetts governor blames President Barack Obama, a Democrat, for the country's exploding debt and deficits. Romney himself has not yet provided enough policy detail to show whether his budget plan would cut the deficit in the long term. The budget that his running mate, Wisconsin Rep. Paul Ryan, wrote and that House Republicans passed this year shows a decline in the deficit each year from 2013 until 2017, when it is forecast to be $488billion. But beginning in 2019, it begins rising again each year through 2022, when it is forecast to be $728billion. Two days after accepting his party's nomination, Romney rolled out a pared-down version of his acceptance speech. His Ohio appearance was the first of two campaign events planned for Saturday. Those were his last scheduled public appearances before he spends a few days in New England preparing for three debates planned in October with Obama.

A Romney spokesman said the campaign currently has no public events planned for the most competitive states during the Democratic National Convention that starts Tuesday, and that Romney would be sequestered with Ohio Sen. Rob Portman preparing for the debates. Obama campaigned in three battleground states last week during Romney's Republican National Convention. Ryan, the vice presidential nominee, will campaign in Greenville, N.C., Monday, and other Romney allies also will make appearances on his behalf. On Saturday, Romney stood in a cavernous Art Deco train station in the heart of the industrial Midwest - the Union Terminal in Cincinnati - and told a screaming, cheering crowd that the country is stronger when it hangs together. His voice was hoarse as he delivered his remarks, though he was clearly buoyed by the energy of the crowd. Buckeye: Republican vice presidential candidate, Rep.

Ohio welcome: Ryan greets supporters during the tailgate party . Cooking with the enemy: Ryan, who graduated from Miami University, flips burgers with an Ohio State supporter . 'United, America built the strongest economy in the history of the earth. United we put Neil Armstrong on the moon,' Romney said. 'United we face down unspeakable darkness.' He mentioned the hardships facing families who are struggling with rising prices for food and gas and having trouble finding well-paying jobs, saying: ""We recognize what a great responsibility you've given us. How much you expect from us to be able to get back the White House and get America back on track. He pointed to Obama's own convention speech. 'He famously said he was going to slow the rise of the oceans and he was going to heal the planet,' Romney said. 'Our promise to you is this: We're going to help the American people and help the families of America. Romney spoke on the first day of college football season, and as he began his speech, he said: 'Let me tell you, if you have a coach that is zero and 23 million, you say it's time to get a new coach.' Love and honour: With hands clasped, Ryan speaks to his alma mater team Miami University before the start of their game against The Ohio State University . He referred to the 23 million Americans who are unemployed, and said: 'It's time for America to see a winning season again, and we're going to bring it to them.' As Romney spoke, Ryan, his running mate, attended Ohio State game against his alma mater, Miami University of Ohio, in Columbus. A Romney spokesman did not respond to a request for comment about whether Romney planned to watch any of the day's games, follow the score of any particular matchup or had a team that he backs, though spokesman Kevin Madden said staffers had been talking to him about the day's match-ups.

"By . Associated Press . PUBLISHED: . 09:09 EST, 1 September 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 11:56 EST, 1 September 2012 . A cruise line company left in disrepute over claims one of its ships ignored pleas for help from a stricken fishing boat has fought back, saying it can prove the allegations to be false. Six months after two Panamanian fishermen died at sea, Princess Cruises says it has new information to counter accusations of distress signals being ignored, which have landed the company in a court battle. In statement released on Thursday the California-based liner operator said that it compared a video of the fishermen's boat when it was found off Ecuador with a photograph of the boat taken by birdwatchers aboard the Star Princess off Panama last March and concluded they were not the same. Dispute: Princess Cruises says the photographs taken by birdwatchers on board the ship do not match video footage of the fishing boat . Jeff Gilligan was one of the passengers who spotted the tiny fishing boat while bird watching but his messages to the captain did not get through . The video, taken by someone on the fishing boat that rescued survivor Adrian Vasquez, clearly shows the name 'Fifty Cent' painted in big red letters on the bow, while the photo of the boat taken from the deck of the Star Princess does not. The birdwatchers notified the ship's crew that men on the small boat were signaling and appeared to be in trouble, but the ship never changed course to help them. Princess has said that word never reached the captain, and the crew on the bridge saw no signs of distress. Vasquez and the families of the two fishermen who died are suing the cruise line. The 18-year-old Vazquez and his companions, Fernando Osorio, 16, and Elvis Oropeza, 31, set off for a night of fishing on February 24 from Rio Hato, a small fishing and farming town on the Pacific coast of Panama that was once the site of a U.S. Army base guarding the Panama Canal. Their motor broke down on the way back and the men drifted at sea for weeks. Osorio and Oropeza died. Vazquez was rescued by a fishing boat March 22 near Ecuador's Galapagos Islands, more than 600 miles from where they had set out. Incredible strength: Vasquez, bottom left, survived, while his two friends were killed at sea . Out of mobile phone range, they had no choice but to survive on fish they had caught and hoped they would be spotted. Since being rescued Vásquez has told how he used a piece of red cloth to try and flag the vessel down. Vásquez said he immediately shouted to his two friends Elvis Oropeza Betancourt, 31, and Fernando Osario, 16, that he had spotted the ship. Though very weak and near death, Elvis also joined in by using a brightly coloured life jacket. The ship didn't stop, and the tiny fishing boat drifted for another two weeks before it was found. By then, Vásquez's two friends had died. '""I said, 'God will not forgive them,""' he said, 'Today, I still feel rage when I remember that.' Vasquez' attorney, attorney Edna Ramos, said they have proof the boat seen by the birdwatchers was the same boat, including the fact that the ship passengers described a blue sailcloth or tarp aboard the vessel, of the same kind his boat had. 'Ignored sightings': Three passengers on a deck of the Star Princess claim to have reported seeing frantic signals from those aboard the stranded fishing boat, but say the liner continued to sail on . 'You can see photos in which the same characteristics are seen ... you can see the blue tarp, which had fallen down by the time of the rescue, and the poles that held it up,' she said. 'The cruise company is just trying to extend this, to wear us out until we give up,' she said. 'We are ready to fight for years. This is the message that we want to transmit to mankind: we cannot become insensitive to human suffering. 'This was simply condemning them to death of great suffering. This is not just a lawsuit against the cruise company, it is a message to mankind.' The cruise line said it had the video and the photo analyzed by Michael Snyder, a retired photo analyst and photogrammetry expert from NASA's Johnson Space Center, who concluded that they were different boats. Jeff Gilligan, of Portland, Oregon, who took photos of a small boat from the deck of the Star Princess, said he had no comment on whether it is the same boat. Princess added that the captain of the fishing boat that rescued Vasquez gave a sworn statement saying Vasquez never said anything about seeing a cruise ship pass by when he told of his ordeal. This map shows the ill-fated fishing boat's movements, starting in Rio Hato and ending up near the Galapagos Islands . A drift analysis charting the movements of the two boats by Weather Routing Inc., a meteorological consulting firm, concluded it was unlikely the Fifty Cent was the boat sighted by the passengers, Princess said. 'While this remains a tragic story, we are gratified to have scientific confirmation that Star Princess was never in the vicinity of the adrift boat and that the boat photographed by our passengers was not the adrift Fifty Cent,' Alan Buckelew, president and CEO of Princess Cruises, said in a statement. 'Nevertheless, we have used this as a valuable learning opportunity and have strengthened our bridge reporting procedures to ensure that all messages of concern from passengers or crew are carefully evaluated by our senior bridge officers,' he said.","A ship operated by Princess Cruises was alleged to have ignored distress signals from a stricken fishing boat .

Exam watchdogs last night dismissed calls for the wholesale regrading of this summer’s English GCSE papers, despite admitting that nearly 60,000 pupils who entered early got away with an easier test. Ofqual said schools had been ‘surprised’ after ‘two decades of grade inflation’ were finally brought under control. It said English grades issued to nearly 670,000 pupils this summer were fair and comparable with last year, and regrading would be ‘impossible to justify’. Scroll down to hear from the National Association of Head Teachers . Action: Teachers and parents protest outside Education Secretary Michael Gove's office earlier this week over claims GCSE English exams were unfairly marked . The watchdog conceded that English . GCSEs set in January – taken by more than 58,000 pupils – were ‘graded . generously’. However, it had decided it would be unfair to strip these . candidates of their grades. Heads and teachers denounced the report as a ‘whitewash’ and renewed threats of legal action against exam boards. Ofqual’s report claimed that schools . were partly to blame for the problem by attaching too much importance to . grade boundaries set in January that they should have known were . subject to change. This had caused some teachers to make excessively . generous predictions of pupils’ final achievements. 'Grade robbers': Headteachers today warned they could still mount a legal challenge over GCSE English as Ofqual said that this summer's results will not be re-graded . Under pressure: Education Secretary Michael Gove (pictured) has been called on to make a statement to Parliament on Monday about how the government intends to address concerns about GCSE English . Q. So, now that Ofqual has published its findings, is that the end of the matter, then? No. The unions are generally unhappy about Ofqual's stance. The Association of School and College Leaders (ASCL) maintains that there has been a 'systemic failure' in the awarding of GCSE English grades. They are most concerned that thousands of students who should have got a C in their English GCSE instead got a D, generally considered a fail, even though officially it is a pass, and that it could affect their chances of getting into the sixth-form college, or gaining an apprenticeship. Q. What do the unions want to happen? There have been calls for results to be re-graded and Ofqual to reconsider its findings. They say it is 'wholly unacceptable to leave the students and their teachers to pick up the pieces of a problem they did not cause' and that 'it is not acceptable or practicable to make the students resit examinations'. They also say that the grade boundaries should have not have been moved during the academic year amid fears that too many children were going to get a C. Q. What will happen now? Ofqual says it will continue to go through any further evidence with unions and talk to them about wider issues around exams and gradings, as well as information and advice to teachers and schools. Labour education spokesman Stephen Twigg wants Education Secretary Michael Gove to address the issue in Parliament on Monday, when MPs go back after their summer break. And education unions bosses are threatening to begin a legal challenge against the grade boundary changes on the grounds that it disadvantaged certain groups of students. This could be a protracted debate. Up to 1,000 schools submitted evidence to Ofqual’s inquiry claiming that English grades were lower than expected. But Ofqual insisted: ‘The standard set . for these English GCSEs is comparable with that in previous years. Each . exam board set standards for the qualifications in the manner . expected.’ In a concession, Ofqual said it would . allow pupils, as a one-off, an extra, earlier resit opportunity in . November. But this will come as little comfort to those who were . supposed to be starting sixth-form or college courses on Monday and . missed the  C grades they needed to confirm places. Ofqual carried out the inquiry after the first drop in GCSE results in the exam’s history. Headache: Teachers claim the grade boundary changes during the year have disadvantaged certain groups of students . Concern focused on English after the C . pass mark dropped 1.5 points – from 65.4 to 63.9 per cent. C grades in . the subject are demanded by many employers and universities while . schools risk closure or being taken over if they persistently fail to . bring enough pupils up to the standard. Ofqual said: ‘We know that schools and colleges will be disappointed with our conclusions. ‘Many will have been hoping that we . would conclude that the June grade boundaries were too harsh, and that . we should return to the January boundaries. 'Doing so would undermine . standards and damage confidence.’ But Brian Lightman of the Association . of School and College Leaders, said: ‘There has been a systemic failure . over the awarding of English GCSE grades. If necessary we will resort to . a legal challenge.’ 2010: New GCSE English syllabuses introduced with pupils sitting exam and submitting two pieces of controlled assessment.

Fall From Grace: Erica DePalo, 33, is the reigning 'Teach of the Year' in Essex County, New Jersey . A New Jersey 'Teacher of the Year' is under arrest over claims she had a summer affair with a teenage student. Erica DePalo, 33, romanced a 15-year-old West Orange High School pupil from mid-June until just a week ago, according to police. The honors English teacher is Essex County's reigning top teacher for the 2011-12 school year. But she now faces first- and second-degree aggravated sexual assault charges, as well as a claim for endangering the welfare of a child. The single woman from the town of Montclair is being held at a northern New Jersey lock-up in lieu of $100,000 bail. 'I don’t have any children,' DePalo remarked after winning her award, 'and I always say that I don’t have any children to go home and take care of. 'But every morning and every day that I go to school I have 110 children that are very near-and-dear to my heart.' 'The district has taken strong action by . suspending the employee immediately and indefinitely,' Superintendent . James O'Neill noted in a statement, adding that he plans to 'cooperate . with the prosecutor's office in every way.' Sacked: DePalo has been suspended indefinitely from her post as an honors English teacher after allegedly carrying on an affair with one the students in her class . The allegations belie DePalo's pedigree. She graduated from Villanova - a Roman-Catholic college in Philadelphia - with an English degree, before continuing her studies at New York University's Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, where she earned her master's in Liberal Studies. Officials made counselors available at the high school following the arrest.

"By . Meghan Keneally and Hugo Gye . PUBLISHED: . 14:36 EST, 2 September 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 17:58 EST, 2 September 2012 . Mitt Romney got a rave review during this week's church service as his close friend hotel billionaire J.W. Marriott Jr. praised the presidential candidate for bringing positive attention to their shared religion. 'There has never been as much positive attention to the church, thanks to the wonderful campaign of Mitt Romney and his family,' the 80-year-old J.W. Marriott Jr. said at Sunday service at the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in New Hampshire. The quick note of praise comes just days after the Republican National Convention, where the candidate and his wife both spoke personally about their Mormon beliefs and also highlighted members of their church who spoke to the nationally televised audience about Mitt's role in the lay organization. Devout: Mitt and Ann Romney have begun speaking more openly about their religious beliefs, including their speeches during the Republican National Convention . Though only a select few members of the candidate's press pool were allowed into the Church for today's service, CNN reports that Marriott feels that, because of the campaign, the church is 'coming out of obscurity. He also cited an unattributed statistic that 90 per cent of all media reports relating to Romney's faith have 'been favorable'. 'That's a great tribute to Mitt and Ann and their family for living such an exemplary life,' he said. 'Now that we're out of obscurity, everybody is looking at us and saying, ""Are you as good as the Romneys?""' ABC News reports that Mr and Mrs Romney, who were sitting in the sixth row of the church in Wolfeboro, had little visible reaction to the comments. The former Massachusetts governor and hotel magnate have been close friends, as were generations of their family. Mitt's . father, George Romney, was in fact so close to J.W. Jr's father J. Willard Marriott that Romney named his son after him. Mitt is the . politician's middle name, and his legal first name is Willard. Friends in hand: Nancy Marriott handed her umbrella to Ann Romney as she walked into the service at Wolfeboro, New Hampshire . Happy to see you: Once inside, Nancy's husband J.W. Marriott Jr praised the Romneys and what their openness has done for the public perception of Mormonism . The praise for the Romneys from with their church comes as the candidate's opponents continue to attack his convention speech last week for failing to mention the military. Republican campaign strategist Eric Fehrnstrom defended Mr Romney, pointing out that the previous day he had 'talked about Afghanistan' in an address to a group of veterans. 'Governor Romney thought it was a privilege to be speaking to people who had served so nobly,' Mr Fehrnstrom told CNN. As the Democratic convention starts up in Charlotte, North Carolina this week, the GOP will aim to remain in the spotlight by holding daily events on the sidelines, while Republican running mate Paul Ryan will make a speech in nearby Greenville on Monday. The Marriotts aren't the only ones who . appear to be happy with the Romney campaign, as the latest Rasmussen . Report tracking poll alleges that Mr Romney earned 48 per cent of the . respondents support while President Obama trailed behind with 44 per . cent. This increase marks a clear change since before last week's . Republican National Convention when Obama was leading. Sunday was also memorable for Mr Romney as the day he finally picked up his millionth follower on Twitter, though he still remains some way behind the President, who has over 19million. Verbally proud: J.W. Marriott Jr., of the hotel magnate family, praised Mitt and Ann Romney during church on Sunday . In addition to his verbal praise, Mr . Marriott has also pledged a significant amount of financial support to . his friend's campaign. Federal . election filings show that he has pledged $1million in personal . donations to Restore Our Future, a political action committee designed . to help Romney's campaign. He is far from alone, as The New York Times reported in July, about 20 well-connected Mormons had donated almost $8million to the same PAC. Though . Mr Marriott kept his remarks about the Romneys brief, he did talk at . length about an interview he had given nearly two decades ago to show . how the times have changed regarding the public's understanding of . Mormonism. He recalled a CBS interview with . the now-deceased journalist Mike Wallace, and Mr Marriott talked about . the long undergarments that Mormons wear. Besides just describing the . custom, which involves wearing 'a t-shirt and pair of boxer shorts', he . talked about how it nearly saved his life. 'Of . course the one question that they put on the air was, I understand . Mormons wear different underwear, and I said yes, and he says, ""Do . you?""’ Mr Marriott said. 'I’d . been involved in a very serious boat accident, here in New Hampshire. I . caught fire; my polyester pants had burned off all the way to my waist. But my undergarments from my waist down to my knees had not even been . singed. There was not a mark on them. And I said, these holy . undergarments saved my life.' Long-time friends: This undated photo shows Lenore Romney (center), Mitt's mother, and Mrs J. Willard Marriott together. The couples were so close that Mitt (whose first name is Willard) is named after the elder Mr Marriott . Mr Marriott was not the only public figure to praise Mr Romney this weekend - action star Chuck Norris also announced his support of the Republican in a video he filmed alongside his wife Gena. The message, aimed primarily at evangelical Christians, warned: 'Our great country and freedom are under attack. 'We're at a tipping point and, quite possibly, our country as we know it may be lost forever if we don't change the course in which our country is headed.' Mr Norris added: 'We can no longer sit quietly or stand on the sidelines and watch our country go the way of socialism or something much worse,' urging conservative voters to head to the polls on Election Day.","Hotel magnate J.W.

On the rather stodgy agenda of the House of Commons, you are more likely to find members tabling motions than standing on tables. Nadine Dorries, however, appears happy to raise the bar – and probably a few eyebrows – with this pose on the terrace. The outspoken Tory MP took advantage of the summer recess for a photoshoot for Tatler in a members-only area of Parliament - and then slammed Prime Minister David Cameron in an interview with the society magazine. Turning the tables: Nadine Dorries strikes a pose on the House of Commons terrace . She branded him patronising and sexist and challenged him to 'spend more of his time being a Conservative'. The glossy women's magazine focuses on the glamorous lives and lifestyles of the upper class . Ms Dorries dismissed the Prime . Minister as 'a sheep in wolf's clothing' while praising his old rival . Boris Johnson as a Tory who could reach out to ordinary voters. She previously hit the headlines when . she denounced Mr Cameron and Chancellor George Osborne as 'arrogant . posh boys who don't know the price of milk'. The MP for Mid Bedfordshire indicated . that she is still angry at his put-down of her at Prime Minister's . Question's when he called her 'frustrated'. She said: 'It was a patronising, . sexist thing to do, and that's not the act of a statesman or someone . worthy of the position of Prime Minister.' Ms Dorries, 55, was in in towering . £550 satin and leather Manolo Blahnik heels as she clambered on top of a . table to take in the view with the London Eye and the Thames as a backdrop. She wore a £1,299 blue silk dress by designer Oscar de la Renta for the terrace pose. She then changed into a £1,260 sequinned dress by Erdem – a label popular with Sarah Jessica Parker and Gwyneth Paltrow – for another shot, which shows her with hand on hip as she leans against the ornate Commons brickwork. For anyone who suspected she was nursing catwalk ambitions, she had a clear message. ‘I wouldn’t want to do this every day, but it is fun,’ she told the society magazine. While the daring pictures show a new side to the Tory MP, she is accustomed to creating a stir in Westminster. All in a day's work: She shows a different side in Tatler . She continued her broadside against the Mr Osborne in the Tatler interview, describing him as ‘a Machiavellian . who manipulates people and practises dark arts’. Under fire: Louise Mensch was criticised by Nadine Dorries . Despite her criticisms of the party . leadership, Ms Dorries insisted that she was not a natural rebel and . had, in the past, held Mr Cameron in great affection. She said: 'I've never been disloyal to this . party until now. If you had asked me even 18 months ago: ""would you ever . vote against your party""? I would have said: ""no because the party is much . bigger and more important than me."" And because I felt great affection . for Dave in a sisterly brotherly kind of way.' Amid intense speculation that Mr Johnson is positioning himself for a future Tory leadership challenge, she pointedly praised the London mayor. 'I love Boris. He reaches the parts that other politicians can't. And he had an office next to mine and I used to go and wake him up to make him vote,' she said. 'But what's important is that he does more than speak inwards into Westminster. There are millions of people out there who need to know that there are ordinary people in Parliament. 'They've got this impression of us, and we've got a responsibility to break that image.' Just days ago she was locked in a . catfight with MP Louise Mensch over the media’s portrayal of Prince . Harry following his naked Las Vegas billiards party. Mrs . Dorries accused the fellow Tory – who was in favour of publication of . photos of the prince naked – of being ‘void of principle’. And she . condemned Mrs Mensch, 41, for undermining women in Parliament, . dismissing her as ‘an ultimate loyalist Cameroon, regardless of the . issues’.","Dorries stands on tables in a members-only area of Parliament .

Allem Kerr from Balloch, Dunbartonshire in Scotland, has spent years trying to register her existence but may be forced to go to court to do so . A woman who has lived in Scotland since her British family moved from South Africa when she was four is going to court to prove she exists - after losing her birth certificate . Angry Allem Kerr, 25, was born in South Africa after her parents had emigrated. They returned to the UK more than 20 years ago but she cannot work, go on holiday abroad, apply for a driving licence or go to university after losing her birth certificate 13 years ago. She has tried in vain to register her existence but Home Office officials and the consulate of South Africa keep telling her there is no official record of her birth. Miss Kerr, of Balloch, West Dunbartonshire, even tried to contact the hospital where she was born but to her dismay found it had been shut down and the records moved or lost. The identity crisis means the 25-year-old, who wants to study nursing at university, is also unable to marry long-term boyfriend Joel Healy, 26. Her agonising ordeal has left her Scottish parents Ann, 55, an MS sufferer, and dad Andrew, 59, Ann’s full-time carer, struggling to support her. Out of desperation, she wrote to the Prime Minister last year, whose office vowed to pass her details on to the Home Office. But Miss Kerr said she has been left without a further reply and still has her life on hold. The only option left to her now is to convince the Court of Session in Edinburgh that she is genetically linked to her mother, and therefore automatically a British citizen. The aspiring nurse, who is in talks with lawyers, said: ‘I’m frustrated and angry. ‘I’m British. I happen to have been born in South Africa but I have lived in Scotland almost my entire life, but proving it seems to be a problem. ‘I wrote to David Cameron and his secretary replied that she would pass it on to the Home Office, but that was months ago and I’ve heard nothing. ‘I want to work and go to university . and support myself but I can’t. I will do whatever it takes and if I . have to go to court to prove I exist then that’s what I’ll do.’ Allem . was born in South Africa after her Scottish mum and dad decided to . emigrate but the family returned to Scotland when she was four. Miss Kerr, 25, is unable to marry her long-term boyfriend Joel Healy, 26, without her passport, or even live with him without a job to support herself . Her brother Alasdair, 27, and sister Mallory, 23, both have their birth certificates and are eligible to work, while Miss Kerr’s was lost in a house move when she was 12. Since then she and her parents have tried in vain to track down the vital piece of paper, which has stopped her from gaining a passport and traveling abroad on holiday. Miss Kerr held down part-time jobs until she returned to college five years ago. But when she applied to the University of the West of Scotland to study nursing she was refused as she did not have the documentation. Her desperate struggle has led her to Dumbarton MSP Jackie Baillie, former West Dunbartonshire MP John McFall, the Home Office and the South African Embassy in London. But embassy staff could find no record of her birth and sent her back to the British Government. An attempt to apply for naturalisation was refused because she is not considered an immigrant. Miss Kerr added: ‘I have basically been told I don’t exist. ‘I have cried so many times over this. I just want to live a normal life. ‘I . have been speaking to the passport office from the word go and they . have told me there is no point applying because legally I don’t exist. Pictured as a two-year-old, left, in 1989 with her older brother Alasdair while living in South Africa where she was born . ‘It’s ridiculous. I just want the consulate to recognise my birth so I can do all the things that everyone else takes for granted. ‘It’s not fair on my parents. I want to move in with my boyfriend but we can’t afford to because he doesn’t earn enough to support me. ‘I hate asking for money to do the simplest thing but it is all I can do. I want to earn my own.’ Mum Ann said: ‘The government should be giving her benefits to live until it is sorted. ‘People who move here from other countries are entitled, but my daughter, who is Scottish, isn’t. ‘It  seems she has fewer rights than everyone else and it’s not fair.’ Grace McGill, an immigration lawyer at Scottish law firm McGill and Co, said the only option left is to apply for a declaration of parentage at the Court of Session. ‘Allem’s mum would have to prove to the court that Allem is her daughter using a DNA test and from that Allem’s nationality is inferred, because her mum is British.’ A spokesman for the Identity and Passport Service said: ‘While we sympathise with Ms Kerr’s situation, the Identity and Passport Service can only issue British passports to British citizens. ‘We are offering advice to help her provide alternative supporting documents when she applies for her passport.’","Allem Kerr, 25, was born in South Africa to British parents and moved to Scotland when she was four .

It was early evening and under the lights of the small, artfully shabby garden bar of the Chateau Marmont, troubled Hollywood actress Lindsay Lohan was drinking with close friend Lady Gaga. ‘Lindsay was on good form that night,’ said a friend who saw her. ‘Italked to her and her eyes were clear and she didn’t appear to be under the influence of anything. ‘She and Gaga seemed to be getting on like a house on fire. Gaga kept going behind the bushes to smoke, but Lindsay didn’t go with her. Driven out: Lindsay Lohan was informed of her eviction Chateau Marmont by letter following a dispute over an unpaid £29,000 bill . REPUTATION: The Chateau Marmont hotel in West Hollywood . She was charm itself – laughing and joking like she didn’t have a care in the world.’ But not long after that night, Lohan, 26, was again in the news for the wrong reasons. The Chateau – which has been her home for much of the past decade – told her she was banned from the premises, and details were leaked of her unpaid bill of more than £29,000, including room-service meals, £500 on her mini-bar in one night and £432 worth of cigarettes over 47 days. Days later, she was accused of badly damaging a dressing room on the set of her latest film, Liz & Dick – a biopic of Elizabeth Taylor’s relationship with Richard Burton. Day job: Lohan on the set of Liz & Dick in LA . The quintessential Hollywood wild-child has long been better known for her drug-taking, car-crash relationships and multiple arrests than her acting work. Yet even by her standards, this latest episode is remarkable. Throughout its 80-year history, the Chateau Marmont’s reputation for hedonism has been matched only by its discretion. Its celebrity guests know their sordid secrets – from trysts in lifts to drug overdoses – will remain within its turreted walls. Every hellraising celebrity has stayed there, from Jimi Hendrix to Phil Spector and John Belushi. None has ever been thrown out, until now. ‘Lindsay has been pretty much living at . the Chateau for years, and during her worst periods, when she was taking . a lot of drugs, they always took care of her,’ says a source. ‘For her failure to pay this bill to have been made public shows that eventhe place she considers her home just can’t take any more of her.’ As a child, Lohan’s red hair and green eyes and natural comic timing earned her roles in hit films The Parent Trap, Freaky Friday and teen classic Mean Girls. By the age of 18, she had netted a £20 million fortune. But over the past few years, her drug and alcohol addictions have destroyed a promising career. Letter: An extract from the letter to Lohan from the hotel asking her to leave . Her repeated attempts to revive her film career have been thwarted by her inability to change her lifestyle, which has led to three attempts at rehab, along with three stints in jail for driving under the influence of narcotics and, later, breaking the terms of her probation. Last year, she pleaded guilty to the theft of a £1,500 necklace and was sentenced to 120 days in jail, which she served under house arrest. A friend says: ‘Lindsay is genuinely trying to get back into her career, but Lindsay being Lindsay, controversy just naturally finds her. ‘She’s a Jekyll and Hyde character. There’s the lovely Lindsay who is a charming and thoughtful friend, but she changes entirely when she’s taken something or drunk too much. She surrounds herself with lackeys and hangers-on who sponge off her and don’t give her good advice.’ Lohan’s part of Elizabeth Taylor in Liz & Dick was seen as a major step towards salvaging her ailing reputation and proving she still has talent, but during filming in June, an ambulance was called to the Ritz-Carlton hotel where she was found ‘unresponsive’ in her room. Her mother Dina claimed no drugs were involved, saying: ‘She was just exhausted.’ Her unreliability means most major film studios will not hire her because the cost of insurance is prohibitive. ‘It would be hard to think of a person more hated by Hollywood than Lindsay,’ one insider told The Mail on Sunday. The only work she can get is low budget and often low-rent. She is filming The Canyons, in which she has a topless sex scene with James Deen, a porn actor, and last year she posed naked for Playboy magazine. Following her banning from Chateau Marmont, Lohan said she assumed the producers of Liz & Dick were covering the expenses.

A fitness fan died after he became trapped beneath a 40kg weight-lifting bar following a late-night drinking session, an inquest has heard. Christopher Bailey, 28, was discovered by his landlord lying on a weights bench with the bar compressing his neck, in a gym set up in the garage of the house they shared in East Sussex. Mr Bailey had been drinking Jack Daniels whiskey with his landlord Oliver Steer and another tenant, Kevin Mare, into the early hours of May 19 before he decided to lift weights in the garage, the inquest at Brighton Coroners Court was told. Crushed: Christopher Bailey, 28, was found lying on a weights bench in the garage of his East Sussex home . Shortly before 1pm Mr Steer - who had since been to bed - found Mr Bailey on the weights bench with the bar lying across his neck. A burnt out cannabis joint was found beside the bench in the garage of the house in Portslade, the inquest heard. The 57-year-old managed to remove the bar and attempted to resuscitate Mr Bailey on the instruction of the 999 call handler, but the inquest heard that he had been dead for several hours. Describing the discovery in a statement read out in the court, Mr Steer said: 'I saw Chris lying back on his weight-bench, as soon as I saw him, his face and colour of his lips, I knew something wasn’t right. 'I screamed and called his name. I lifted the weights from his chest and called 999. 'They told me to go back and do CPR, I did but he was completely cold and not responding. 'I carried on for a few minutes but I knew he was dead.' 'Catastrophic': The 28-year-old chef had been drinking before deciding to lift weights in his home gym . Mr Steer added that Mr Bailey had bought the weight-lifting equipment about six weeks earlier and had cancelled his gym membership. The weight-lifting bar was loaded with 15kg of weights on each end with the bar itself weighing 10kg.A post-mortem examination showed that Mr Bailey, a chef at a bakery, died as a result of compression to the neck. Toxicology tests also showed that Mr Bailey was, at 274mg per 100ml of blood, three-and-a-half times the drink-drive limit with cannabis also found in his blood. Pathologist Dr David Wright said: 'We are not as strong as we normally are when we have 274mg of alcohol on board, not so co-ordinated.' Inquest: A verdict of accidental death was recorded at Brighton Coroners Court, pictured . Detective Sergeant Mark Rosser, of Sussex Police, added: 'Established body builders could lift a lot more than that but for a normal person, 40kg across your throat would be catastrophic.' The inquest heard that Mr Bailey had talked to his sister Kayleigh Tedford during the evening and she told the inquest he was 'fine and happy'. The family described him as a 'loving member of the family' who stayed in touch since he moved to Brighton from his home city of Nottingham in late 2011. Recording a verdict of accidental death, Brighton coroner Veronica Hamilton-Deeley said: 'He has had a good drink, he’s decided he’s going to lift some weights, which is not a good idea, and he may have got away it. 'What has happened is that bar that is weighing 40kg, which is not lightweight by any account, has come down on his neck for whatever reason, he’s not able to move it and that has resulted in neck compression which has slowed his heart down and been the direct cause of his death.' The coroner concluded by expressing her condolences to the family members present at the inquest.","Christopher Bailey had been drinking whiskey with his landlord and another tenant before he decided to lift weights at their East Sussex home .

A businessman killed a love rival after rekindling a relationship with a former girlfriend from 40 years ago, a court heard yesterday. Kenneth Bill, 63, allegedly hatched an elaborate murder plot after the married woman ended their relationship. He believed a romance with the girlfriend of his youth could work with her husband John Hay, 61, out of the way, the jury was told.

Bill had ‘become obsessed’ with her . and ‘closed his mind to the obvious fact the relationship was going . nowhere’, the court heard.

The staggering extent to which high street bank staff chasing bonuses and commission are routinely ripping off customers was laid bare in a scathing report yesterday. At the same time, the Daily Mail can reveal that 40 per cent of staff at Lloyds Banking Group earn extra payments if customers are persuaded to buy additional financial products. They get bonuses if they can entice millions of loyal account holders to fork out for costly insurance policies or 'premium' current accounts which charge a monthly fee. Probe: Lloyds Banking Group is facing further investigation and a possible penalty following an FSA investigation into 'dysfunctional' incentive schemes in the banking sector . Separately, in a report by the . Financial  Services Authority regulator, published  yesterday, account . holders were said to be viewed only as 'sales targets' exploited by . 'pile it high and sell it quick' tactics that verge on the criminal. Banks were told to clean up their act or face a major clampdown. The FSA's report into the incentive payments has brought another day of shame for Britain's financial industry. It revealed that one firm has been . referred to its Enforcement and Financial Crime Division. Sources named . the bank as Lloyds, which is 41 per cent owned by the taxpayer. Anrgy: FSA boss Martin Wheatley says: 'Financial institutions have changed their view of consumers from someone to serve to someone to sell to' Ruthless salesmen were said to be so . desperate to meet sales targets that they even sell to family members . such as their elderly mothers or sisters. Others were found guilty of colluding . to 'intentionally overcharge' a customer to trigger a bonus payout. The . report said that some firms pay a 'Super Bonus' of up to £10,000 to the . first 21 workers who meet a sales target. In other cases, staff are not paid a . basic salary, which means their own financial survival depends on their . ability to sell, a situation the report warned 'significantly' increased . the risk of mis-selling. Yesterday Martin Wheatley, of the FSA, . said: 'Some time ago, financial institutions changed their view of . consumers from people to serve, to people to sell to.' He read the riot act to the industry – . which also includes insurers and investment firms – telling companies . to 'clean up their act' or face a clampdown in the next 12 to 18 months. Firms can continue to pay commission, but such payments must benefit the customer, not the salesmen. 'It has been too easy, for too long, . for those selling or giving advice to be motivated solely by the rewards . on offer to them, rather than how to enrich their customer,' he said. 'We all know what it is like to walk . into a bank to do something simple, like paying a credit card bill, only . for the person behind the counter to ask if you would like to extend . your credit, take out more insurance or look at their competitive . mortgage rates?' He warned some of the mis-selling was 'very close to fraud, which is a criminal offence'. Crackdown: FSA says cultural change is needed and chief executives at top banks are ultimately accountable for the way their staff are incentivised . The scale of the mis-selling is shocking in an industry which provides products essential to the lives of millions. Of the 22 firms investigated by the . FSA between September 2010 and September 2011, 20 were found to have . 'features in their incentive schemes that increased the risk of . mis-selling'. The report highlights one salesman 'blatantly misleading' a customer to scoop £1,000. In another case, two salesmen . 'colluded to intentionally overcharge' a customer because the bonus was . linked to the amount that the client had agreed to pay for the product. Yesterday the Financial Services . Consumer Panel criticised the FSA for being 'slow to respond' to a . problem which has existed for decades. Chairman Adam Phillips said: 'The . regulator has made a commitment to change the industry's behaviour. We . hope that this time the industry will get the message and not try to . find a way to get around the rules as they have done in the past.' Lloyds Banking Group said it had made . significant changes to its incentive schemes this year, adding: 'Today . these schemes reward staff for providing high quality customer service, . assessed by a wide range of metrics.' But it confirmed that around 40,000 of its 100,000 staff were eligible for incentive schemes. On serving customers:'Why is it that every time I walk into the bank to do something simple, like pay my credit card bill, the person behind the counter asks me if I would like to extend my credit, take out more insurance or look at their competitive mortgage rates? 'When did this happen? Banks for me used to be a service – a place where you would go in, stand in a queue, have a pleasant chat with the clerk and go about your daily business. Some time ago, this changed – financial institutions have changed their view of consumers from someone to serve to someone to sell to.'  On why selling financial products is different from flogging fast food or TVs:'This is not like when you go to a fast food restaurant and the server asks ‘do you want fries with that?’, or ‘do you want to go large?’. We all know they ask these questions because they are encouraged to make the most of every sale, and when customers are standing at the counter, they are more likely to say yes. But then we also know what to expect – chiefly lots of salt, calories and a bigger waistline. 'But far fewer of us actually have such a clear understanding of financial services.  We also mostly trust those selling or giving advice to be acting in our best interests. 'These are often complex and long-term products that turn into long-term problems if they go wrong. 'The cost of going large may cost us a few pence – the cost of buying the wrong mortgage could see you lose your home. 'And while it is annoying that when you buy a TV they only seem interested in selling you the warranty, that is nothing compared to trying to find a safe home for your money, only for the person in the bank to only seem interested in selling you a confusing product that could put your life savings at risk.'On changing culture at the top:'Firms need to change how they incentivise their staff and learn to manage their risks. CEOs are ultimately accountable for the way their staff are incentivised, so we expect them to take a real interest in fixing this.  Recurring problems need to be investigated, action taken and redress paid to consumers who have lost out. 'I want to draw a line in the sand here.'","A probe into banks' incentive schemes uncovered 'serious' failings at Lloyds, which now faces further investigation and a potential penalty .

Hundreds of Afghan soldiers have been removed from the ranks as part of an investigation into Taliban infiltration of the country's military. The backgrounds of Afghan troops are being double-checked after 45 Coalition forces were killed in a surge of so-called 'green on blue' killings during the past year, the Afghan Defence Ministry has said. Britain and its allies are pushing for Afghan forces to take over security for the country by the end of 2014 but this is being undermined by the number of attacks by infiltrators. Investigation: Hundreds of Afghan troops have been removed from the ranks as part of an investigation into infiltration by the Taliban (stock picture) Cooperation: Soldiers from the Afghanistan National Army (ANA) and US Army soldiers conduct a joint patrol at Nevay-deh village in Kandahar province today (stock picture) At least 12 insider attacks have taken place in August alone, resulting in 15 deaths, with Seven Britons killed this year when Afghan security forces have turned on Western troops. At the weekend, NATO said it was suspending training of Afghan police amid security concerns. The killings are straining an alliance . already stretched by a tense relationship with Afghanistan’s president, . Hamid Karzai, and disagreements over NATO tactics that Kabul says . endanger civilians. NATO Secretary-General Anders Fogh . Rasmussen has expressed deep concern to Karzai over the growing number of . assaults by Afghan troops on coalition forces. Plan: International soldiers are training and mentoring Afghan forces so they can assume responsibility for the country's security by the end of 2014. It means that Nato soldiers must work closely with the Afghan police they are training (stock picture) In July, Warrant Officer Class 2 Leonard Perran Thomas, 44, (not pictured) from the Royal Corps of Signals, Guardsman Craig Roderick, 22, (left) and Guardsman Apete Tuisovurua, 28, (right) of the 1st Battalion the Welsh Guards, were killed in a 'green on blue' attack . Defense Ministry spokesman Mohammad . Zahir Azimi would not give any figures for the number of soldiers . removed - but said many of those affected had been pushed out because . they had either incomplete or forged documents. Azimi added that the investigation began . about six months ago but could provide no further details. He said more . information would be released next week. NATO did not comment on Azimi's remarks. Militants have infiltrated the ranks . of the Afghan army and police and in other cases are believed to have . coerced or persuaded legitimate members to turn on their coalition . partners. The insider killings, together with . the persistent level of violence in Afghanistan and the number of . foreign troops dying - 320 so far this year - are threatening to derail . NATO's plan to hand over security to local forces. The deputy commander of the U.S.-led NATO coalition, British Lt Gen Adrian Bradshaw, confirmed that the . U.S. military had halted the training of some Afghan forces. Although the move affects only about . 1,000 trainees in the Afghan Local Police, a small fraction of the . country's 350,000-strong army and police, it highlighted the potential . of the attacks to derail the U.S.-Afghan security handover. He added that the decision was 'part . of a number of actions recently instituted to reinforce existing . precautions related to the insider threat.' He said much of the re-vetting task . had already been finished and that some individuals had been suspended . pending further investigation, or removed from the force. Bradshaw made the remarks after meeting with Karzai to discuss ways to counter the threat posed by insider attacks. On Tuesday, Fogh Rasmussen said the . insider shootings will not derail plans to reduce the number of international . troops in Afghanistan, but that in the meantime, NATO will 'do everything . it takes' to stop such killings. Additional measures to prevent such . attacks may include strengthened vetting and screening procedures, . improved counterintelligence, as well as cultural awareness training, . Fogh Rasmussen said. U.S. Gen. John R. Allen, who commands NATO's 129,000-strong force, briefed . the alliance's top decision-making body on Wednesday about the . shootings. In further violence today, NATO said two of its service members died in a helicopter crash in eastern Afghanistan. It did not provide details of their nationalities, but said the crash was under investigation. Their deaths brought to six the number of foreign troops who have been killed in Afghanistan this month. The Taliban claimed to have shot down a helicopter in eastern Logar province, where coalition forces are staging an operation against the insurgents. However, the militants often issue claims of responsibility even when it is unclear whether they had anything to do with the downing of an aircraft.

If this nine-year-old boy's reaction is anything to go by, the Coalition's plan to allow homeowners to build small extensions or conservatories without needing planning permission is an absolute stinker. Young Josh Wood appeared to stare with disbelief as David Cameron announced the policy - and his partner in crime Nick Clegg didn't look that interested either. Today the Prime Minister and his deputy were at a new housing development in Cheshunt, Hertfordshire, to announce they would sweep away planning rules and bureaucracy so homes, shops, offices and industrial units will be allowed to expand with no need to ask their local authority. Perhaps realising he needed more convincing, the Prime Minister and Nick Clegg then popped for a cup of tea with Josh and his mother to explain their planning reforms further. Scroll down for videos . Joint effort: David Cameron and Nick Clegg are watched by the less than impressed Josh Wood, 9, as they launched their planning changes in Cheshunt, Hertfordshire today . The move is designed to encourage . conservatories, loft extensions or garage conversions, and support . businesses which want to grow or diversify. However, it will also mean residents no longer have a right to challenge thousands of construction schemes on neighbouring properties, even if they believe it will have an adverse impact on them. In other plans, the Government is to offer up to £10billion in state-backed guarantees to encourage housing developments, a move which ministers believe could mean 100,000 homes being built over three years. Rules on how many affordable homes must be included in a development may also be relaxed. Cuppa: David Cameron and Nick Clegg then had some tea with Josh and his mum Jenny in their new home and explained their planning reforms . There will be help for 16,500 first-time buyers, who will be offered equity loans of up to 20 per cent of the property value that can be used as a deposit. New ‘permitted development rights’ will . be introduced to allow a change of use from commercial to residential . purposes – although local authorities will be able to seek exemptions . where they believe there will be a negative economic impact . The move will mean residents no longer have a right to challenge thousands of construction schemes . It means disused offices or light . industrial premises will be able to switch to residential developments . with no need for planning permission. Currently, homeowners need planning permission to make any change that extends more than a few feet from their property’s rear wall, requiring them to fill in complicated application forms that typically take eight weeks or more to be considered. Ministers say this adds unnecessary cost and delays to people’s improvement plans. Under . the new system, the size of extensions allowed without permission, . therefore, will be doubled to about 20 feet for terraced properties and . 26 feet for detatched. The change will not apply in protected areas, including conservation areas, World Heritage Sites, the Broads and areas of outstanding natural beauty, where development rights are already more limited. Under changes, businesses will be able to expand premises by 100 square metres and industrial units by 200 square metres, and shops and offices will be permitted to develop up to the boundary of the premises. Every year there are more than 400,000 planning applications processed, with almost 200,000 for residential improvements, many of which are for changes such as conservatories or extensions. Ministers say the changes will provide a crucial and immediate stimulus to the construction sector. There will be a month-long consultation on the measures before they are implemented later in the year. ‘This government means business in delivering plans to help people build new homes and kick-start the economy,' the Prime Minister and Deputy Prime Minister will say. ‘We’re determined to cut through the bureaucracy that holds us back. Yep, this one should protect me from booing crowds: Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne points at at a Bushmaster vehicle during a visit to defence contractor Thales' facility in Glasgow today . You could record your Budget speech with one of those: The Chancellor was accompanied on his tour by chief executive of Thales UK Victor Chavez (right) ‘That starts with getting the planners off our backs, getting behind the businesses that have the ambition to expand, and meeting the aspirations of families that want to buy or improve a home.’ A Government source added: ‘We want to make it easier for families to undertake home improvements: not just to cut red tape and strengthen individual homeowners’ rights, but also to help generate economic activity which will support small traders in particular.’","The PM and DPM were in Cheshunt, Herts, to launch the policy but young Josh Wood appeared less than impressed .

It was just five months earlier Maria Del Carmen Gomez, 53, of Las Vegas, Nevada was attacked outside a convenience store by an 18-inch blade that severed both her hands and sliced brutally across her head. Months later into her recovery, taking numerous tolling surgeries to repair her hands and scalp, doctors delivered one last crushing blow with her diagnosis of metastatic uterine cancer. Fallen: After surviving a brutal machete attack in March, Maria Del Carmen Gomez, 53, has died after diagnosed with cancer just months later . Resting in her final moments around friends and family last weekend, Ms Gomez described the Kindred hospital's walls in details only seen by her and the aid of her Morphine's drip. 'God will take care of him,' she managed to moan on Saturday about her accused attacker Armando Vergara-Martinez, according to the Las Vegas Review-Journal. 'I know he will,' she said. It was the last day before she fell into a coma. 'I know her immune system had to be way, way down,' her plastic surgeon Carl Williams told the Review-Journal of her recovery efforts from her attack on March 21. Survivor: Ms Gomez had both of her hands severed by her attacker while recently regaining function of her left hand, pictured beside her other hand still bandaged . Recovery: Ms Gomez, later diagnosed with metastatic uterine cancer, shows the extent of her hand injuries after her machete attack earlier this year . 'I don't think she could fight anymore after what she went through,' he said. - Surgeon Dr Carl Williams . At the time medics found that Ms Gomez had a malignant disease at an 'advanced stage' but was curable. They planned to give her chemotherapy treatment and were hopeful she would recover, but with her dual fight to recover from the machete attack, she was ultimately beaten. Vergara-Martinez is currently being held in the Clark County Detention Center on a $250,000 bond, with his trial on charges of attempted murder and domestic valance schedule for October. Battling: Gomez, right, underwent chemotherapy and extensive surgery for the cancer treatment alone, months after the attack which saw her knifed in the head and arms . Horrific: Surgeons carried out a painstaking five-hour operation on Gomez's hands after she was slashed outside a convenience store in Vegas five months ago . Accused: Gomez's ex-boyfriend, Armando Vergara-Martinez, 49, has since been charged with attempted murder and domestic violence . She told CBS earlier this year: 'I tried to open my car. He started hitting me without saying [anything]. 'He stabbed me two, three times on my head. I felt such strong hits over there. 'He cut these three fingers and left it on the floor.' Doctors said that Gomez could have been decapitated if her attacker had aimed a couple of inches lower. Medical staff who . reattached Gomez's hands believe she was . covering her head with them when she was knifed. She had since said she had no idea why she was attacked. Two years ago she had already reported Martinez to police for attacking her. He spent 41 days in jail no a misdemeanour strangulation charge. Gomez added: 'I never went back to him, but I did speak to him on the phone. 'And then one day he said he needed help getting recommendations for a job. I told him to come by the store on the night the attack happened.' Doctors praised her remarkable resilience in battling through the machete attack recovery and then refusing to be beaten by cancer. She endured a five-hour surgical . procedure to remove her uterus and ovaries as experts cut out the cancer . from her colon, diaphragm and lymph nodes. Brutal: Gomez was also savagely knifed in the back of the head during the frenzied attack earlier this year . Savage: Surgeons managed to reattach Gomez's hands in an operation, after the attack severed both at the wrist . ‘I know I'm seeing the brutality of this terrible crime in a whole new light,’ said Williams. ‘I think others will, too, and we'll do more to stop it in this community."" Family of Ms Gomez said that she never complained about her pain, but smiled as much as she could and promised to champion against domestic violence once released. ‘But if they can't save my hands, I'll just use my voice,’ she said, according to the Review-Journal. ‘I can talk without my hands.’","Maria Del Carmen Gomez was left fighting for life after being slashed in March by former boyfriend .

A British toddler was found playing next to a busy road in Portugal after being abandoned by her ‘clearly drunk’ parents. The two-year-old’s parents, described as middle-class teachers on holiday, were  found drinking in a bar 100 yards away. Police officers found the hungry youngster – known only as Scarlet – in tears, being comforted by locals. The parents showed no concern for their daughter and became abusive when questioned, police said. Handed to social workers: Scarlet, who was left abandoned by her parents, is being cared for until a court decides when to return her to her parents . A local newspaper said they were so drunk they were unable to tell police Scarlet’s full name. Officers fed the child soup and water in a cafe before taking her to a police station where she wolfed down a fish meal. State prosecutors are considering whether to bring charges. A police spokesman said: ‘The girl was playing on her own right next to a dangerous busy road. ‘Passers-by were obviously concerned for her safety because she was in a risky situation, so they took her and put her in a buggy. ‘They called the police, and when we arrived she was crying in her buggy and was obviously hungry and thirsty. She was fed soup and water while we tracked down her parents, who were in a bar 100 metres away drinking. The girl was found alone, crying in her buggy in seaside village Carcavelos, Portugal . ‘They were clearly very drunk and officers tried to speak to them in several languages but they refused to acknowledge the officers. 'Later they became very abusive to our officers and locals. The girl was taken to the police station, given some dry clothes because she was wet, and some more food. She ate very quickly. ‘The parents were also taken to the police station but they were too drunk to speak properly. They showed absolutely no concern for her welfare so she was taken into care. ‘She spent the night at an emergency centre for children and as far as I know she is still there. Well known for wine: The little girl was handed to social workers after police found her and her parents in the holiday destination which became famous for its strong white wine . ‘It is an extremely sad situation for the poor little girl. As far as we know she has no brothers and sisters.’ Scarlet was found in the village of Carcavelos, 15 miles west of the capital Lisbon, on Monday night. Portuguese newspaper Diario de Noticias described the man and woman as ‘middle-class teachers’, aged 40 and 38, who were on holiday from the UK and so drunk they were unable to tell police their daughter’s full name. However, another newspaper said they lived in Carcavelos and worked as teachers in Lisbon. The parents were drinking in a cafe called Manhas do Chocolate, in a tree-lined square in Carcavelos. A two-way road runs through the square, which is dotted with  cafes and restaurants on its  cobbled pavements. A manager at the cafe said the couple had drunk at least three glasses of white wine from 5pm until the police arrived. But she contradicted the police account, saying the girl  was with her parents when  officers arrived. The manager, who did not want to be named, said: ‘I arrived at work at around 7.30pm and the couple were already sat here at a table on the pavement outside the cafe. ‘The mother looked completely out of it and the father also looked very strange. I don’t drink so I can’t swear they were drunk, but they certainly didn’t seem normal. ‘The mother was incapable of standing up. The child was very impatient, crying. I was told there had been an incident earlier when the girl had got out of her pram and somehow run towards the road. ‘A man had grabbed hold of her to stop her running into traffic.

Workmen have been forced to abandon fitting new eco-friendly lampposts on a leafy estate because householders say they look like flying saucers. Furious residents are adamant the new lamps are alien to the landscape. They insist they are 'not in keeping with the historic character' of the pretty 22-acre conservation site. They were outraged when pavements outside their £250,000 homes in Birmingham's Selly Park were dug-up to make way for the modern aluminium street furniture. The new environmentally-friendly lights were supposed to cut light pollution. But angry locals of the 100-year-old estate complained to Birmingham City Council that they did not fit the area's image. Now contractors working for the authority have been forced to halt work on the streets because of the controversy. The town hall now faces finding extra cash to fund so-called 'heritage-style' lamps for the estate - which has always been adorned with cast iron street signs and old-fashioned swan-necked street lamps. Former Birmingham city councillor Andy Foster lives in the area. The 59-year-old claimed work started last week without warning. He said: 'A hole appeared in the footpath outside my house, about six feet from my front window, where there had not been a lamppost before. 'They started work a week before they said they were going to so we were shocked. 'When we complained, we discovered the . contractors working for the council do a rather nice looking lamppost . for conservation areas, so we have asked for them.' Leafy Fourth Avenue was among the streets where work was to begin installing the lampposts that were alien to the estate . Work was about to start installing posts outside the home of Andrew Foster . Old-fashioned lighting will now be fitted to appease the angry residents of Selly Park's pretty streets . Even though the new ones 'were supposed to be terribly efficient and green' Andy thought it 'best to have the heritage ones.' 'We’ve got them to have a temporary stop but the city council might have to find some extra money to install the heritage lampposts,' he said. The hole outside Andy Foster's home was ready for the new lighting until locals expressed their unhappiness about the shiny new lighting. Another disgruntled resident was Thomas Bonham. The 51-year-old said: 'I couldn’t believe it when they said they were going to install these monstrosities in our area. 'They look like flying saucers or something from one of those sci-fi films. They are an absolute eyesore. 'It doesn’t fit in with the historic feel of the area and it made a lot of the residents feel very angry.' The leafy estate was awarded conservation area status in 2009, meaning historic features are protected. As a result of the complaints Amey - contracted to do the council’s highways work for 25 years - has halted the installation and ordered old fashioned lampposts instead. An Amey spokeswoman admitted they will cost the council more.She said: 'Residents were concerned that, although their roads are listed as a conservation area, they had not had the opportunity to request an upgrade to heritage-style streetlights. 'As a consequence of the concerns raised, the lighting improvement works in the area have been put on hold in order that a review can be undertaken. 'Normally in a conservation area we would look if they wanted heritage lights but that didn’t happen this time for some reason. 'It’s a case of talking to the residents and finding out what they want and finding a way forward that pleases everyone. 'There’s an extra cost to the heritage lights and councillors will need to find the funding from their constituency committee.'","Householders left furious as they complain new lampposts look like UFOs .

Every day, a student attending Georgia Technical College was forced to walk 15 miles each way to class because he didn’t own a car. But last month, a hit-and-run driver left him with a slew of serious injuries, making the walk impossible for 20-year-old Branden Whitehead. Now, thanks to the generosity of Vanessa Peebles, a woman who saw the student’s story on the local news, Whitehead can drive to class. Scroll down for video . Baby you can drive my car: A generous woman in Georgia donated her 1990 Cadillac to 20-year-old student Branden Whitehead, pictured . Hot wheels: The 1990 Cadillac Fleetwood means that Whitehead will no longer have to walk 15 miles each way to class . Peebles, who was touched by the student’s story after seeing it on a local news report, gave only one condition to her benevolent gift. ‘I want to see you a surgeon one day,’ she said. Whitehead is studying to be a surgical technician. He said that getting the 1990 Cadillac Fleetwood has only inspired him to work harder toward his dream. ‘I’m thankful to be alive,’ he told MyFoxAtlanta, ‘and that makes me want to be a surgical tech even more.’ Last month, Whitehead was walking the 15 miles in Coweta County, Georgia. He said that a car came out of nowhere, throwing him up in the air. Caveat: Peebles said that he gets to keep the car on the condition he continues to do well in school . Roadside damage: He was struck by a hit-and-run driver last month on his walk back from school, puncturing a lung and broke a few ribs . Grateful: The thankful student gives Peebles a hug for her generosity . ‘All of a sudden, out of nowhere, I felt a sharp pain and I blacked out,’ he told MyFoxAtlanta at the time. ‘When I woke up, I looked down at my arm – there was a puddle of blood.’ He suffered several injuries, including broken ribs, cuts, bruises, and a punctured lung. The student was in the hospital for five days as he recovered. He said his 30-pound backpack, stuffed to the brim, might have saved his life. Police in East Point are still trying to track down the hit-and-run driver. The car, which rumbles ominously before starting, no doubt needs some work, but for Whitehall, the gift is beyond measure. And perhaps the best news of all? Rather than walking four-and-a-half hours each way, the trek to class only takes Whitehead 15 minutes.

When a woman in California started losing feeling in her lower extremities and then her upper, she was terrified at what was happening to her body. When Sara Alvarez found out that her brain was infected with a calcified tapeworm and she had to have a life-threatening surgery, the terror grew. Her case is one of a growing number of cases popping up in the west-coast state, and now some physicians are saying that neurocysticercosis – where tapeworms lodge in one’s brain – is becoming a first-world problem. Emergency: Sara Alvarez had the parasites removed in a potentially life-threatening operation in 2011 . Alvarez, was told by doctors in December 2010 that she needed this surgery to extricate the growing number of parasites in her brain. Her children were horrified that they might lose their mother. Doctors in Redwood, California were at first baffled by her symptoms, and first diagnosed her with a tumour. It was only after a CT scan revealed calcified tapeworm larvae that they knew she had neurocysticercosis. Only about 1,900 cases are reported in U.S. hospitals annually. Alvarez, who was born in Mexico, told Scientific American that she experienced crippling headaches for more than two decades before she was diagnosed. She received the operation in January of 2011. A large part of her hair had to be shaven to allow surgeons to cut into her scalp and reach her brain. Dangerous: The large circle indicated by the black arrow is a sucker in the brain, the dark dots highlighted with green arrows are calcified larvae of the pork tapeworm . The tapeworm larvae form little nodules in the brain like this one . A study published by PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases in January stated that 304 of the hospitalisations in the U.S. during 2009 were in California. In addition, 85 per cent of those identified in the state were Latino, with 72 per cent from the southern areas. Many of the population are Hispanic immigrants who do not have access to proper health education and are unaware how the parasite is spread. Tapeworm larvae are passed through direct contact with human feces. Though her surgery was a success, some medical professionals are worried of the growing number of cysticerosis cases in the state. Neurocysticercosis . is a common disease within third-world and developing countries, . affecting 50million people globally, but is largely overlooked by . physicians in America because of inexpensive early treatment options and . hygiene available. Patricia Wilkins, a scientist with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, told Scientific American that neurocysticercosis has been affecting a growing number of marginalised populations within the U.S., including immigrant Latinos and Hispanics. She said that these populations are not given the education necessary to prevent infections. According to the CDC, neurocysticercosis is preventable, but happens with larval cysts of the pork tapeworm enter the brain. It is the most severe form of cyticercosis. A person can become infected then they unwittingly ingest microscopic eggs. For instance, if an infected person who hasn’t properly washed their hands after defecation then contaminates food or other surfaces, that puts others at risk for contracting the parasite. The larvae can then be unknowingly consumed. When the larvae hatch inside the body, they migrate up towards the brain. Microscopic: A Cestode Tapeworm (Taenia) cysticercus is invisible to the human eye and is passed from human to human in fecal matter . The CDC notes that the infection is preventable if people thoroughly wash their hands after using the toilet. Treatment for neurocysticercosis is extremely costly. The CDC estimates that the average cost of hospitalisation for one infected cost $37,600. A staggering 43 per cent of the financial burden was passed to Medicaid.","Sara Alvarez was diagnosed with neurocysticercosis, where pork larvae infect the brain .

Outspoken new Health Minister Anna Soubry faced a Tory call to resign after saying she backed changing the law on assisted suicide. The former television presenter, who joined the Government in last week’s reshuffle, said it was ‘ridiculous and appalling’ that Britons had to ‘go abroad to end their life’. Ms Soubry immediately came under attack from fellow Tories, with one warning that any attempt to change the law would be ‘fiercely’ opposed. Health Minister Anna Soubry has been asked to resign by Tories after calling for assisted suicide to be made legal . Tory MP Peter Bone dismissed her views as ‘totally wrong’. He said: ‘If she wants to speak out like this on something that is matter for Parliament – not government – she should resign as a Minister and make them.’ Tory MP Mark Pritchard said: ‘Any new right-to-die legislation will be rigorously fought by MPs from across the House.’ The outspoken remarks  put her on a collision course with new Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt, with sources saying he would not appreciate ‘attention-seeking’ by members of his Ministerial team. Assisted suicide is punishable by up to 14 years’ imprisonment. Tony Nicklinson's lawyers failed to overturn the country's euthanasia law before he died at home last month after suffering from locked-in syndrome since 2005 . However, 60 people have killed themselves with the help of friends or family in Britain since 2009. Ms Soubry said that the laws governing how people could take their lives needed to ‘evolve’ to allow people to die at home. But the MP – who is also a barrister – made it clear she did not approve of allowing doctors to end patients’ lives. ‘The rules we have about who we don’t prosecute allow things to happen, but there’s a good argument that we should be a bit more honest about it,’ she said. A Downing Street spokesman said the Government had no plans to legislate on assisted suicide, adding that if any new laws were proposed, MPs would be given a free vote.","Anna Soubry said it was 'ridiculous and appalling' that Britons had to 'go abroad to end their life'

The newborn, who had been reported . missing, was found in a bin to the rear of the building in Wolverhampton, West Midlands, at 6.30pm on Saturday. A 24-year-old woman has been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder. Theory: Detectives believe the baby may have fallen 50ft from the fifth floor of this block of flats in Wolverhampton, West Midlands . Inquiry: Police have begun an attempted murder investigation after the newborn girl was found in a bin behind the flats . The young girl was taken to Birmingham Children's Hospital with serious injuries. Police have also arrested a 32-year-old man on suspicion of assisting an offender. Detective Inspector John Smith, of West Midlands Police's Public Protection Unit, said: 'We are making a number of enquiries to establish how this young baby has come to sustain her injuries, and how she came to be found in the refuse area of the flats.' Scene: Police found the baby in a bin in a refuse collection area at the rear of the building after a girl was reported missing . Out of bounds: Police sealed off large areas of the block of flats as they investigated the case . 'We urge anyone who has information to help our investigation to come forward at the earliest opportunity.' A police officer at the scene said: 'I can tell you that the child is thought to have fallen from the fifth floor. 'That's all I can tell you at the moment.' He said: 'The police came and asked me if there had been any commotion between 16.30 and 19.00 on Saturday night. 'They have had a non-stop presence. All the rubbish chutes are still blocked up and detectives have been back and forth.' Constant presence: Residents said police officers had been at the building ever since the girl was found . Fact finding: A police officer stands at an entrance to the block of flats where the baby girl was found in a bin with serious injuries . Nora Donnelly, 49, said: 'On Saturday night there were about five police cars and two ambulances at the front door. 'You could hear a child crying in the back of one of the ambulances. Emergency: Police were called to the block of flats in Boscobel Crescent, Wolverhampton, on Saturday evening . 'It's strange because I don't remember seeing anyone pregnant or carrying a young child around.

The wealthiest man in France is to sue the country’s biggest Left-wing newspaper for running a front-page picture of him under the headline: ‘Get lost, you rich p***k!’ Liberation’s attack on Bernard Arnault, 63, worth around £32billion and also Europe’s richest man, came after his decision to seek Belgian nationality as President Francois Hollande prepares to introduce a 75 per cent tax rate for the super-wealthy. Yesterday’s headline, with a picture of Mr Arnault smiling in front of an overnight travel bag, read: ‘Casse-toi riche con!’ Tax avoidance: Bernard Arnault has applied for Belgian nationality . News of his intention to quit France . has prompted anger across the country, but Mr Arnault, whose LVMH . luxury-goods group runs companies such as Dior, Dom Perignon and Louis . Vuitton, insists his desire to become a Belgian has nothing to do with . avoiding tax. He claims he is moving for personal reasons and will continue paying taxes in France. But few believe him, and Liberation was not alone in its attack. Mr Hollande, who has openly admitted that he dislikes rich people, said Mr Arnaud 'should have reflected on what it means to ask for another nationality, because we are proud to be French'. Benoit Hamon, Minister for the Social Economy, also suggested Mr Arnault was unpatriotic saying: 'I expect the French, especially the richest ones, to be true patriots.' Leftist politician Jean-Luc Melenchon . said the country did not need such ‘parasites’ and Socialist lawmaker . Bruno Le Roux said Mr Arnault was ‘betraying France’s recovery’. But Mr Arnault, who runs luxury goods giant LVMH – which includes designer brands like Christian Dior and Louis Vuitton – said Liberation had gone too far. He is suing the paper for making 'public personal insults', with a statement reading: 'Bernard Arnault has no other choice, given the extreme vulgarity and brutality' of the headline in Liberation, which is the French equivalent of The Guardian. Former Prime Minister of France Francois . Fillon (left) said ‘stupid decisions’ by the socialist government led by . President Francois Hollande (right) had prompted Mr Arnault to become a . Belgian . If found guilty Liberation will be . expected to run a public apology, probably on its front page, although . any fine will be nominal. Politicians . from right and left are now accusing Mr Hollande of driving . wealth-creating tycoons out of the country to cities like Brussels, . London, and Geneva, where they will pay less tax. Francois . Fillon, the conservative who stepped down as Prime Minister of France . in May, said 'stupid decisions' by the Socialists who replaced his own . government had prompted Mr Arnault to become a Belgian. Mr . Fillon said: 'When you take stupid decisions, you get these terrible . results. The chief of one of the best companies in the world, who . symbolises French know-how and success, known throughout the world, has . been prompted to change his nationality because of the fiscal policy . which is being applied in our country.' 'If there's a certain brutality, or . vulgarity in Liberation, it it precisely because of the situation in . which we find ourselves.' Sylvain Bourmeau . Despite the row, Mr Hollande insists there will be 'no exceptions' to his 75 per cent super tax, which with other contributions will see some giving up to 90 per cent of their salaries to the government. Mr Hollande said that the tax was 'symbolic' and would 'set an example' to everybody else in society. The Socialist President has made no secret of the fact that he sees taxing the rich as the key to revitalising France's stagnant economy. Liberation used the front page headline as a play on words on a similar insult former conservative President Nicolas Sarkozy used in 2008. Mr Sarkozy, a close personal friend of Mr Arnault, told a man who had been rude to him in a crowd in Paris: 'casse-toi, pauvre con'. This means 'go away, poor p****', with the idea being that the Socialist were telling multi-billionaires like Mr Arnault 'go away, rich p****'. In an editorial linked to their front page, Liberation made it clear that they were highlighting a nationwide debate about Mr Hollande apparently driving the rich out of France with his high taxes. 'It is primarily ironic humour, ' said deputy editor Sylvain Bourmeau. 'If there's a certain brutality, or vulgarity in Liberation, it it precisely because of the situation in which we find ourselves. 'The decision by Bernard Arnault' to see Belgian nationality 'also contains a certain dose of vulgarity, and there's been a boomerang effect.' If Mr Arnaud wins his case he is likely to get no more than 1 euro in damages. Liberation was founded by the world famous philosopher Jean-Paul Sartre in 1973, and is viewed as the mouthpiece of liberal France. It sells around 140,000 copies a day, and is widely read online.","Liberation aimed attack at tycoon Bernard Arnault .

Here's an artist who's completely dotty about her work - spending months at a time constructing portraits of celebrities using paper dots made by a hole punch. Nikki Douthwaite painstakingly arranges hundreds of thousands of tiny coloured dots to make up the incredible portraits, which can sell for five figure sums. Ms Douthwaite, from Timperley, Cheshire, punches holes in the paper before using tweezers and glue to stick them on in a precise order - making up a host of famous faces when viewed from afar. Marilyn Monroe, Mohammed Ali, Jimi Hendrix, Cheryl Cole and John Lennon have all been given the dot treatment - and Simon Cowell admitted he had ordered a dot portrait of himself as a gift for a friend. Movie star: Marilyn Monroe recreated in hundreds of thousands of dots by artist Nikki Douthwaite . Meticulous detail: From a distance the famous portrait of boxing icon Mohammed Ali is unmistakable . Dedicated Nikki has even suffered repetitive strain injuries in her arm, hand and shoulder after spending hundreds of hours repetitively sticking dots to a canvas. Nikki, who holds a Guinness World Record for the highest number of dots ever used in a picture, said: 'My goal is to create two experiences for the viewer. 'The first is a close up experience of either thousands of tiny, mixed up coloured dots, which in detail intrigue in themselves, but may seem chaotic and to have no order to the viewer at this distance. 'The second experience is the far away view, the viewers’ eyes and brain mix the dots and colours together, revealing the relationships of the details and the image as a whole. 'My choice of portraits comes from an interest in faces, in the biological form; bone and muscle construction, sociological, expression and individuality. Close up: John Lennon imagined through hundreds of thousands of hole punched paper spheres . Panning further out: The tiny pieces of paper create a realistic grainy effect in this portrait of John Lennon . The finished piece: Nikki's enormous portrait of John Lennon propped up against a wall . 'I need complete peace and quiet to create my work, so I try to do most of my work at night, when there are fewer distractions. 'I can be sitting for hours at a time arranging the pieces, which has caused me huge problems with my shoulder. 'But the feeling I get as I see a piece develop, and when it is finally finished is enough to make sure I keep going through the pain. 'It can take several days, working up to eight hours a day, to even punch all the holes I need to begin a piece. It’s not the most exciting thing to do. 'I mix the coloured dots into tones - although the portraits look black and white from a distance, I actually use hundreds of colours, which you can see when you look at a piece close up. 'I work for up to 12 hours at a time, and I’m a meticulous perfectionist - I won’t say a piece is finished until every last dot is in the perfect place.' Pointillism: Nikki recreated this portrait of guitar legend Jimi Hendrix using a technique inspired by post-impressionist painter Georges Seurat . It's clearer now: Jimi Hendrix looking wistful depicted through a sea of dots . The artist: Nikki Douthwaite pictured alongside her artwork of Jenson Button . Nikki’s artworks contain up to 600,000 little dots - with her biggest portrait so far measuring a staggering two metres high and three metres wide. She created her first dot art piece more than four years ago, while studying for an undergraduate degree in art. Nikki took inspiration from Seurat’s famous painting A Sunday Afternoon on the Island of Grande Jatte, which was famously created by Seurat making tiny dots with paint on the canvas, rather than long brush strokes. After visiting the same spot in Paris where he painted the portrait, Nikki decided to create a modern day version - using the tiny dots from a hole punch. It took almost five months for Nikki to create the piece - which used up 587,000 dots. Zoomed in: How the tiny spherical pieces of coloured paper used in Nikki's portraits appear close up . She added: 'My plan was to find the spot in Paris from where Seurat painted this picture and paint whatever I found there at this time. What had changed? What would Seurat see if he were to paint this picture now, 125 years later? 'I went to Paris and found the spot by matching pictures of the original with the current landscape, and recorded my findings as planned. 'On return I found out the hole punch was invented the year he completed his painting in 1886, and he painted in dots, I found that too juicy to ignore. 'I had to work up to 17 hours a day to get it finished in time for my degree show, but it sparked a passion for this type of art which I’m still continuing to explore.' Nikki has been working on her first 'dot art' collection for the past year which will be revealed with F1 supremos McLaren in January at the McLaren technology centre.","Nikki Douthwaite's artworks are composed of up to 600,000 dots .

Disturbing CCTV footage showed her pleading with the driver for eight minutes, while his  passengers simply watched. The girl had to call her mother to ask her to pick her up and began walking in the direction she would be approaching from. But, after travelling less than a mile, she was pounced on by Moran, who, drunk and high on cannabis, dragged her into a park and subjected her to a 25-minute attack. After being found guilty of rape and . wounding with intent, Moran was handed an indeterminate sentence for the . protection of the public. Picking his fingers and nonchalantly . stretching his arms in the dock, he was told he must serve a minimum of . six-and-a-half years before he will be considered for release. He will . be freed only if he is no longer seen as a danger to society. Thrown off: The bus stop outside Boots, Nottingham, where the woman was not allowed to board .

Hearing: Moran was ordered at Nottingham Crown Court to serve more than six years in jail (file picture) The 23-year-old woman thanked those involved in bringing her attacker to justice in a statement issued through local police. She said: ‘First and foremost, I would like to thank my family for their unwavering and unremitting support and prayers during what has been a very difficult time. ‘I would also like to thank the staff at the Queen's Medical Centre for the dedication, professionalism, care and consideration demonstrated by them during my week in hospital and in the weeks that followed on my return for further treatment. ‘The police have not only worked extremely hard on this case, they have also offered a great deal of pastoral support and shown incredible sensitivity towards me, something that often goes unrecognised. For that I will always be grateful. ‘I am now moving forward with my life and I ask that people respect that and allow me and my family to maintain our privacy.’ Judge James Sampson said Moran had . carried out a 'brutal and horrific' attack and had not shown 'an ounce . of remorse or shame' for what he had done. He said his victim was 'intelligent, . hard-working, brave, full of the optimism of youth, and delightful', . adding that she 'for the want of a small act of kindness was left . isolated and vulnerable in the small hours'. Michael Auty, prosecuting, told the . hearing the attack was 'every parent's darkest fear'. However, the court . heard the courageous student had returned to her course and had . achieved a good grade in her law degree. Detective Chief Inspector Rob Griffin, . who was in charge of the investigation, described Moran as a 'vile . predator'. He said police had been humbled by the victim's 'bravery and . resilience'. Despite overwhelming evidence, Moran's . mother yesterday clutched posters saying 'Miscarriage of justice Lies . told in Court' and 'Convicted with no evidence Joseph Moran Innocent'.

Coffee giant Costa has apologised to a mother who was thrown out for feeding her disabled son. Clair Walker was asked to leave after a customer complained she was put off her latte by 15-month-old Brayden being fed through a tube. Mrs Walker, 29, and her husband, Kenneth, 44, said they were told not to return to the Aberdeen shop after the incident on September 4. Unfair: Clair and Kenneth Walker say Costa coffee discriminated against their disabled son Brayden by asking them to leave the shop . Costa investigated after a friend of the couple posted about the incident on Facebook, prompting an angry reaction. The firm said it had apologised to the family and would deal with the member of staff involved. Staff asked Mrs Walker to leave the Bon Accord shopping centre cafe after a customer complained they 'could hear the wind in his tube'. She said: 'I felt the whole situation was disrespectful but I am pleased that Costa called me to apologise. 'I agree that this is a one-off, isolated situation, caused by one person and not Costa as an organisation.'

Mrs Walker added: 'Brayden gets air through it when he feeds. 'The staff said it was making other customers uncomfortable and could we stop and leave. 'They said not to come back - I assumed that meant ever. 'Nobody bats an eyelid when a woman breast-feeds in public - but when you feed a child through a tube they’re outraged. 'I was sickened that someone could be so shallow.' In a statement a Costa spokesman said: 'We are able to confirm that we have now spoken to Mrs Walker, the lady involved, and sincerely apologised for the incident involving her family. 'We will deal with the staff member involved in line with our human resource procedures. We will reinforce our policies around disability to all Costa team members at the earliest opportunity. 'We will increase our focus on teaching staff how to deal better with sensitive situations whatever they may be.' The coffee chain was a partner in a scheme in 2009 that helped disabled people gain work placements and employment. Costa Coffee: Mr and Mrs Walker were asked to leave the branch in Aberdeen's Bon Accord shopping centre . Richard Hamer from Capability Scotland, a campaign group for the disabled, said: 'It seems the everyday lives of disabled children are too much for some people to stomach. 'Costa must take action to show they won’t tolerate such discrimination.' Aberdeen MSP Kevin Stewart said: 'Common sense and courtesy shouldn’t have allowed this.' The Equality and Human Rights Commission for Scotland said that it is possible to look into further action if the Walker family register a complaint.

"By . Associated Press . PUBLISHED: . 05:07 EST, 17 September 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 05:07 EST, 17 September 2012 . A couple from southwestern Idaho took off in their motorhome less than a week after the husband underwent heart surgery because they felt compelled to help search for the body of a man that drowned in a Canadian lake. Gene and Sandy Ralston didn’t know the drowning victim personally until his family reached out the Ralstons in hope that they would use their sonar technology and aluminium boat to help find the missing body. They've recovered the remains of 80 people and participated in the high-profile searches for Laci Peterson and Natalee Holloway. On a mission: Gene and Sandy Ralston started volunteering to search for drowning victims in the 1980s but they became more precise 12 years ago when they began using side-scanning sonar equipment . Their latest case was that of Ralph Der, 59, drowned in early August while fishing at a lake in British Columbia. Although he had never met the Ralstons, they would become intimately involved with the man's family while working to recover his body from the lake floor. 'We know practically everything about him, his favourite fish, and all kinds of things,' said Ralston, who has volunteered with his wife in body searches since the early 1980s. Ralston acknowledges not everyone may understand their life's work - he chuckled at a recent headline in the Canadian newspaper that read: 'Idaho couple with odd hobby bring drowning victim home.' 'We don't think it's odd,' said his wife, Sandy. The Ralstons initially worked with watercrafts, dogs and GPS coordinate systems, but their searches for drowning victims became more exact 12 years ago after they started using side-scanning sonar developed with technology similar to that used in medical ultrasounds. Ralston first learned about the technology in 1999 when he was assisting with a body search in Oregon. He was horrified when the company leading the effort charged the grieving family around $30,000 for their time and use of the equipment, he said. Technology tricks: Ralston's side-scanning sonar is similar to that used in medical ultrasounds . Dedication: The Ralstons travel throughout the country and into Canada, Mexico and Aruba when they are called by the families of victims who are searching for closure and cannot be assisted by police . Ralston and his wife purchased their own scanning sonar in 2000 and travelled later that year to Utah's Bear Lake, where authorities sought help in recovering a young man who drowned six weeks earlier. The Ralstons found the body within a few hours, under more than 100 feet of water. 'It was just such an awesome experience,' Sandy Ralston said, her voice choking up at the memory. 'To actually find somebody when everybody else had just totally given up.' The torpedo-shaped sonar device is 6 feet long and drags behind the boat, mapping the area and recording images in real time for the Ralstons to read on a computer screen. The Ralstons later acquired a remote-operated vehicle, called an ROV, which has a grabbing device that allows them to retrieve bodies. Ralston estimates they've spent $100,000 on their equipment, though they don't charge families for their time or for the use of their technology, asking only for travel expenses. There are other companies that offer similar services, but they typically seek payment, sometimes thousands of dollars for a day's work, Ralston said. Some law enforcement agencies also have the technology but most don't take it outside their jurisdictions nor use it as frequently, Ralston said. High profile: The Ralstons participated in the searches for Natalee Holloway (left) and Laci Peterson (right) Help: In the case of the the disappearance of pregnant Peterson, the Ralstons helped police operations that were underway in Berkeley, California, but the Ralstons could continue their search longer than police . He and his wife, who are in their 60s and mostly retired from their business as environmental consultants specializing in water issues, don't have children and are mostly unencumbered when it comes to travel. 'Typically law enforcement agencies will spend a few days on a search,' Mr Ralston said. 'They don't have the resources that we do, they don't have the luxury of having two or three weeks or more to search for someone.' In eastern Washington, Walla Walla County Sheriff John Turner met the couple this summer when they helped search for a 14-year-old boy who fell in the Snake River after a boat capsized. Mr Turner's agency deployed all their resources in a rescue effort, he said, but at some point it turned into mission to recover the boy's body. 'You cannot, especially for an agency our size, you cannot sustain that level of commitment toward that mission just because you don't have the resources,' said Turner, who called the Ralstons a godsend. 'They have expertise and equipment that we don't have.' A few days into the search, the Ralstons were asked to help find a 12-year-old boy who had also drowned, Turner said. The couple recovered the second drowning victim, and stayed until the following weekend when the first boy was found. While some might find the couple's work weird - maybe even morbid - Turner doesn't see it that way. His agency oversees a search and rescue team that includes about 50 volunteers, he said. Science: The couple use the reflective sonar sounds that come from the seafloor as a gauge of where the bodies may lie . 'People volunteering to help other people is not a strange concept, the Ralstons just do it on a broader scale, and they bring unique experience and tools,' Mr Turner said. The Ralstons have driven twice to Alaska and have also taken their equipment to Mexico City and Aruba. Some years, they'll have just two or three searchers, while during others they'll spend more than 200 days on the road. Among the seven bodies they've found so far this year was Gina Hoogendoorn's father, who drowned in 1997 at Flaming Gorge Reservoir in Wyoming. 'You don't really have that closure, it's like you keep running into a wall, you don't really get that full circle of grieving, you're just stuck somewhere,' said Ms Hoogendoorn, of Rock Springs, Wyoming, who was 18 when her father died. She contacted the Ralstons in April after finding them online. They found her father, Richard Herren, several minutes into their boat search later that month. Hoogendoorn, who never expected to find closure, said she credits the Ralstons for giving her peace about her father, who has since been cremated. The feeling of appreciation is what keeps the Ralstons going even as they reach an age when most couples start thinking about retirement. They know what it means for families to have their services available, and they've also seen tragedy firsthand. Expensive hobby: Though their boat and sonar equipment cost the Ralstons thousands of dollars, they do not charge the grieving families but ask only that their travel expenses be covered . The Ralstons’ foray into the underwater world of body recovery began when they were surveying the Snake River in 1996 for endangered snail species with a Bureau of Reclamation worker when the boat flipped and he drowned. 'We can't say that we know what it would be like to lose a son or a daughter or a wife or a father or that type of thing, but we know pretty well what it means,' Ralston said. They take pride in their commitment, which is why they didn't hesitate to go search for Der in Canada, even as Ralston was recovering from his heart procedure. The day after they recovered the body, Ralston was back in the hospital with internal bleeding due to complications from his heart procedure. He's now doing better with changes to his medication and returned to Canada last week with his wife for Der's funeral. Mr Ralston has vowed to continue the searches as long as he's physically able, but his wife is thinking more and more about passing the torch onto someone else, he said. 'We haven't really found the right person yet,' he said. 'It takes a bit of a special person who, in our opinion, will do more than just work on a weekend and then go home. It needs to be someone who has enough compassion to where they'll stop everything and go on a search, for as long as it takes.'","Gene and Sandy Ralston, both in their 60s, are based in southwestern Idaho .

Shocked: Mother-of-two Tanya Joiner only discovered what had happened to her when she used data protection laws to ask for the information held on her file . Controversial security firm G4S is using undercover surveillance teams disguised as delivery men to spy on the sick or disabled in their homes. The company holds lucrative contracts to carry out investigative work for insurance companies. Papers seen by the Daily Mail reveal how staff are employed to watch covertly those who have lodged claims for the likes of critical injury cover to check they are not faking the extent of their condition. But the documents also reveal how it is ‘usual practice’ to send agents dressed as delivery men to knock on a claimant’s front door while wearing secret cameras. They claim to have a parcel or other such item – which the person did not request – so they can film them at the door. G4S, which was widely condemned for its catastrophic failure to supply enough security guards for the Olympics, said the tactic is known as the ‘parcel pretext’. It is now facing legal action from a disabled woman whose home was entered by one of its staff claiming to be delivering a clothing catalogue. The case has been taken up by civil rights group Liberty, which accused G4S of ‘oppressive and completely disproportionate’ behaviour. Mother-of-two Tanya Joiner only discovered what had happened to her when she used data protection laws to ask for the information held on her file. Couple: Mrs Joiner, who lives on Canvey Island, Essex, with husband Paul, 43, (pictured) and her daughters, suffers from various debilitating medical conditions such as arthritis and fibromyalgia . Mrs Joiner, 38, suffers from various debilitating medical conditions, including arthritis and fibromyalgia – a long-term condition that causes pain all over the body. Her disability prevents her from working and in early 2011 she made a claim on her Zurich critical injury insurance policy. Zurich, which disputes the extent of her disability, responded by engaging covert surveillance experts the Cotswold Group – now a division of G4S – to investigate her circumstances. Mrs Joiner, who lives on Canvey Island, Essex, with husband Paul, 43, and daughters Jamie, 17, and Hannah-Lee, 11, said: ‘Zurich had already sent out a medical examiner, which I knew – but I have since discovered that while he was doing my report, the surveillance started in November 2011. ‘When I applied under the Data Protection Act to see what they had got, I found they had videoed my mother-in-law taking me to the supermarket. There’s hardly any footage of me in it. ‘But then I saw that during several days of surveillance outside, they had also come into my house – and had a picture of me on my sofa. ‘I could barely remember it, but they had knocked on my door with a parcel for me and wanted me to sign for it. My husband told them I couldn’t move, and said they would have to come in. They came into the living room, I signed it, and they left. Surveillance video: Zurich, which disputes the extent of her disability, engaged covert surveillance experts the Cotswold Group - now a division of G4S - to investigate her circumstances . Filming: This surveillance video showed Mrs Joiner, who has arthritis, shopping in a Morrisons store . ‘It was only when I got the report that I found it what had been going on. I was absolutely devastated. I only took out my insurance for the sake of my children. Now I feel like I signed a deal with the devil.’ Zurich refused to pay out on Mrs Joiner’s claim, which she is challenging through the financial ombudsman. 'I was absolutely devastated. I only took out my insurance for the sake of my children. Now I feel like I signed a deal with the devil' Tanya Joiner . She is also demanding an apology and explanation from G4S for the invasion of her home. If that fails, she will sue them for damages in court in a bid to embarrass them and stop similar techniques by other firms. Lawyers insist the company’s actions were illegal and Liberty is pursuing the case on her behalf. But G4S says it has done nothing wrong and was merely pursuing normal procedures – raising the prospect of thousands more people being subjected to the same intrusive tactics. Corinna Ferguson, legal officer for Liberty, said: ‘Of course insurance companies need protection from bogus claims, but that shouldn’t mean riding roughshod over people’s privacy. Investigation: Her disability prevents her from working and in early 2011 she made a claim on her Zurich critical injury insurance policy . ‘G4S tricked their way into a disabled woman’s home – which was oppressive and completely disproportionate. ‘Given the power and influence of this company is ever increasing, shouldn’t they have a better grasp of the law?’ 'G4S tricked their way into a disabled woman’s home – which was oppressive and completely disproportionate. Given the power and influence of this company is ever increasing, shouldn’t they have a better grasp of the law?' Corinna Ferguson, Liberty . Both Cotswold and G4S boast that surveillance is ‘conducted in line with the principles of the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act’. In fact, the Act makes it clear that any uninvited activity inside a private home is ‘intrusive surveillance’ that would require official authorisation. In a letter to Mrs Joiner, G4S director of investigations Stephen Cantello said it was ‘usual practice’ to carry out a ‘positive identification’ of the person under surveillance and there were several ways this could be done. ‘In this particular case the field operative decided to use a parcel pretext. This entails a parcel delivery that is signed by the party concerned, supported if possible by covert film. This is acceptable practice,’ he said.","G4S staff watch injury claimants to ensure they are not faking condition .

Jailed: Jason Novak met the woman last year as they were investigating her fiancee, Christopher L. Branham, above . A sheriff’s deputy may have overstepped his bounds with a key informant in a drug case after the two allegedly had a brief sexual affair while he investigated her fiancé. Then-Detective Jason Novak of the McHenry County Sheriff’s Office in Illinois was reportedly suspended and relegated back to the patrol division in the case. Novak met the woman last year as they were conducting their investigation of Christopher L. Branham, who was suspected of selling illegal narcotics and prescription drugs. The Northwest Herald reported that after their initial meeting in March 2011, Novak kept in contact with the woman, mostly with his cell phone. The allegations are being brought by Branham’s attorney in a bid to have evidence thrown out in his drug case, arguing that Novak took advantage of her. Branham was arrested on April 28, 2011, after his fiancé signed a ‘permission to search’ form at the couple's home. During that search, cops said that they had found a slew of drugs, including morphine, Oxycontin and meth, according to the Herald. In court documents obtained by the Herald, Branham’s attorney Hal Stinespring said: 'Novak persisted in his interaction with Fiance, much of which became personal and not relevant to the issue of potential contraband in Branham’s home. 'Some of Novak's contact with Fiance was sexual in nature and relayed over phone calls or text messages on his department-issued cell phone.' The court documents allege that the fiancée took a page from the Monica Lewinsky scandal when she wore a blue dress as she travelled to Novak’s house, where she allegedly performed a sex act on him, the evidence of which remains on the dress.

A businessman underwent a five-hour operation to rebuild his skull after he was glassed by a thug at a pub. Simon Morris, 31, suffered such appalling injuries that surgeons had to peel back part of his face to insert four titanium plates. Mr Morris, from Hagley, Worcestershire, had to have more than 60 stapes to his face and is now permanently scarred following the vicious attack in a pub in Birmingham. Simon Morris, pictured in hospital, had to have a five-hour operation to rebuild his skull after he was glassed . The Victoria pub in Birmingham where a thug chucked a pint glass which hit Mr Morris on his face . Captured: Police want to hear from anybody who knows who this man is captured on CCTV outside the pub . Separate micro-stitches had to be used on his shattered eye socket. Police are hunting the thug who threw the glass in The Victoria pub on John Bright . Street, Birmingham, at 11.30pm on August 3 and have released CCTV footage. The advertising and marketing firm boss said: 'I just went out for a drink - and have been through all of this. 'The physical injuries have been bad enough, but there’s also been the psychological damage and pressure that it has put on relationships. 'I have found it very difficult to accept the changes to my face.' Mr Morris was drinking with work colleagues at The Victoria when he was hit by the glass, which had been thrown across the room. The married businessman, who runs Bareface Media in the Custard Factory, initially thought he had been punched. He had, in fact, been hit with a full pint glass, thrown by a drinker who was fighting with others in a row over two women. Mr Morris was in the pub with workmates and foreigners on work experience placements. He said: 'We offer placements for young people and had some over from Germany. We wanted to show them what Birmingham was like - unfortunately they did not leave with the best impression. 'In fact, I was talking to another guy from Manchester. I was telling him how good Birmingham was when it felt like I had been punched on the side of my face. 'I was caught completely unaware. I didn’t know what had happened. 'I fell to the floor and the people involved in the scuffle nearby all ran off. I was told later that the glass was thrown by a guy who had been arguing in the two groups about two women. 'I think it was aimed at somebody else, but it obviously missed.' Permanent scarring: The victim now suffers from double vision and numbness in his face . Shocked: Mr Morris was having drinks with friends and some foreigners on work experience . CCTV: Police want to trace this man captured outside The Victoria pub in Birmingham . Mr Morris was rushed to A&E at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital and an X-ray later revealed the full extent of his horror injuries. As well as the four fractures, he had suffered damage to his sinuses, which had filled with blood, and his eye socket. He was also suffering excruciating pain from a collapsed nerve that was also affecting his teeth. 'The surgeons told me that the glass must have been full,' Simon recalled. 'They said a punch, or an empty glass would not have caused the same level of damage. 'I was on morphine to combat the pain and was hallucinating about seeing white elephants in the room with me. 'After going through the trauma of the operation and all the pain, I was told that I could lose the sight in my eye because of internal bleeding. It was like being hit for a second time. The innocent bystander has had to have his right eye socket rebuilt with five titanium plates . 'Just a few days after this happened my wife’s grandad died yet I was unable to support her, which was upsetting and frustrating. She has really been put through the mill. 'It was also my birthday a couple of days later and the surprise party that had been arranged obviously had to be cancelled.' He has made a remarkable recovery, but is now only able to work in short bursts. He struggles with headaches and finds it difficult to concentrate in sunlight or under bright lights. The businessman also suffers from double vision and numbness in the face, which he has been warned could be permanent. He also finds crowded places difficult to deal with. 'It’s frustrating and it has been a real rollercoaster, but I am trying to get back to reality,' he said. 'My family, friends, the police and the hospital staff have all been brilliant and it has been reassuring that there are some nice people out there. 'It is a bit strange when you turn up for a business meeting and you are wearing a cap to cover the huge scars, but you have to get on with things.' And Simon added about the man responsible: 'What I would say to the person who did this, or the people who know him, is to take a look inside yourself and think about what you have done. 'People like this make a split second decision to do something like this, but do not have to live with the ramifications. 'People should not be allowed to carry on behaving in this way.' Detective Constable Andy Atkinson, from West Midlands Police, said: 'This was a completely innocent bystander who was in the wrong place at the wrong time. It could have happened to anyone. 'He was simply drinking and chatting with friends, when a glass was thrown into the crowd. 'He’s had to go through a terrible ordeal and the person responsible needs to be aware of the damage they’ve done and be held accountable for their actions.'","Simon Morris, 31, permanently scarred after vicious attack in Birmingham .

A witness told police that Boedecker had gotten out of the car, and first said that he had pulled over to take a nap. He later changed his story completely, saying that his girlfriend had been driving, and she is 'bats*** crazy'. Boedecker, whose other business ventures . include Domino's Pizza and Quizno’s, was approached by an officer, who . asked what had happened. A police report obtained by TheSmokingGun.com said that Boedecker told the officer that his girlfriend had been driving, and she ran away after the two had an argument. When asked about the girlfriend, Boedecker told the officer that she is a singer who is 'really f****** famous.' He then asked if the officer had ever heard of Taylor Swift. When the officer pressed for information about where the girlfriend went, Boedecker allegedly motioned toward a neighboring backyard, and then said 'Taylor' was in Nashville.

Cutting agent: The jury considered the haul of paracetamol and caffeine to be prepared as a cutting agent for heroin . Two men have made UK legal history after being convicted of a drugs-related offence even though the substances involved are not illegal, police said. Anthony Woodford, 23, and David Lewinson, 44, stood trial after Lewinson was found with 150kg of ground Paracetamol and caffeine at Dover docks in Kent. Although the substances are not illegal, investigators suspected they would be used as cutting agents for heroin, giving the Class A drug a street value of more than £5 million. The Kent and Essex Serious Crime Directorate launched an investigation and identified Woodford as the organiser of the cross-Channel trip, which led on to a landmark prosecution. The pair were charged under the Serious Crime Act 2007 with 'importing a quantity of caffeine and paracetamol which was capable of encouraging or assisting ... the supply of a controlled drug of Class A'. At Maidstone Crown Court on Monday, a jury found Woodford, of Harlow, Essex, and Lewinson, of Colindale, north London, guilty of the offence. Making history: Anthony Woodford and David Lewinson were found guilty at Maidstone Crown Court making them the first in UK history to be convicted of a drug offence when the substance was legal . Today, Detective Sergeant Mat Scott, . of the Kent and Essex Serious Crime Directorate, said: 'This is the . first time in the UK that a successful prosecution has been made when . the drug found has not itself been an illegal substance.

Police said that Lewinson drove a white Volkswagen Caddy van out of Dover’s Eastern Docks and on to a Dunkirk-bound ferry on April 20 last year.

Police probing the photographer who took the topless pictures of the Duchess of Cambridge are now questioning staff at the French chateau where the couple were staying. In the latest development of the scandal, detectives want to know how the photographer knew exactly where to take the intrusive photos amid suspicions it was an 'inside job'. The news comes after French paparazzo Pascal Rostain said it was an Englishman living in the south of France that staked out the Royal couple at the chateau while on their holiday. And Danish celebrity magazine Se og Hoer has become the fifth publication to print photographs of Kate sunbathing topless as the images have now been seen by millions worldwide. Scroll down for video . Staff at Chateau D'Autet in Southern France, where the Royal couple were holidaying when the pictures were taken, are now being quizzed by police . The pictures, first published in French Closer magazine, left, appeared in a Swedish magazine on Wednesday and in a Danish magazine yesterday . Crime scene: A police source said they will search the place where the pictures were taken more than half a mile from the retreat, pictured . William and Kate have won a court order banning French Closer from selling or republishing the photographs, under the threat of a 100,000 euro fine . A criminal investigation is under way to find and prosecute the . photographer - who could face a year in jail and a £36,000 fine. Police will now search the place where the pictures were taken more than half a mile from the retreat. It is thought they will also look for clues or DNA traces left behind. A source told The Sun newspaper: 'Officially the crime scene is the chateau and its environs. 'This will be visited by detectives who will then have to work out how the photographer came to be there - who alerted him to the presence of the royal couple and where he took the pictures from. 'This kind of investigation involves interviewing as many potential witnesses as possible.' A spokesman for Clarence House said any investigation at the chateau was a matter for the French authorities. Denial: If true, the claim would exonerate French photographer Valerie Suau, who claims she took bikini photos of Kate but not topless ones . Yesterday Mr Rostain, a close . friend of former French First Lady Carla Bruni and one of France's most . notorious long lens photographers, revealed the photographer who took topless pictures of Kate was British. He also sensationally claimed . that the photographer was spying on them on the orders of France's . Closer magazine, which was first to publish 13 intimate images of Kate . and William last week. He told France Metro newspaper in . Lyon: 'The irony of this whole thing is that the photographer who took . these pictures is an Englishman living in the south of France. 'These photos were taken on the orders of Closer, who asked him to sit around for several days to take them. 'For his efforts he did not earn a lot. He could have sold them for 10,000 euros. 'But in fact he was just paid his wages for going to take them. 'He didn't put them on the open market either, where he could have earned a lot more.' Mr Rostain did not specifically say . he knew the identity of Kate's photographer, but is known to be very . well connected among the French paparazzi community. He . defended the person who took them, adding: 'As a photographer, I take . the pictures I want and let the publication decide whether to print . them. 'What they choose to print is not the photographer's problem, but the editor's.' Originally it was believed the intimate photographs may have been taken by a French photographer named Valerie Suau . - nicknamed The Sewer because of the pronunciation of her surname. She has admitted taking pictures of Kate in her bikini, but said she does not know who took the topless photos. The Royal couple this week won a landmark injunction preventing further distribution of the images by Closer, under the threat of a 100,000 euro fine. They . have also handed over all files containing the images to . representatives of the couple on the orders of the judge, after they . were ruled a 'brutal' invasion of privacy. The . court made no ruling for the magazine to name the photographer, . however, and it has the right to protect his or identity under France's . laws on protection of journalistic sources. X marks the spot: The long lens pictures taken of the topless Duchess were shot from the side of the road between trees around half a mile away from the chateau . But the ruling has not prevented the publication of the photos elsewhere. Danish magazine Se Og Hor (See And . Hear) became the fifth publication to print the photographs of the Duchess sunbathing topless yesteday. The magazine's 16-page spread included 14 topless shots of Kate and three where she is changing her bikini bottoms . Yet the photos are still being touted on . the open market worldwide, with magazines in Italy, Denmark and Sweden . all publishing them. St James's Palace said 'proportionate responses were under review'. The Swedish magazine which published the pictures on Wednesday, Se och Hoer and its . Danish counterpart are owned by the Denmark-based Aller Media company. Kim Henningsen, editor-in-chief of the Danish magazine, said he was 'incredibly proud' to have obtained the sole Danish rights to the . photographs. Closer published 13 grainy images of Kate's breasts and bottom last Thursday, branded 'grotesque and unjustifiable' by a Royal spokesman. Italian magazine Chi also published the pictures, while Michael O'Kane, editor of the Irish Daily Star, was suspended after publishing a selection that he called 'tasteful' Italian magazine Chi also published the photos in a 26-page special edition. Chi's editor Alfonso Signorini said on the matter: 'The fact that these are the future rulers of England makes the article more interesting and topical. 'This is a deserving topic because it shows in a completely natural way the daily life of a very famous, young and modern couple in love,' he said. There are thought to be up to 200 photos taken of Kate and William at the time - many of them much more revealing. Closer magazine's editor Laurence Pieau defended her decision to publish 13 of the photos, insisting the images were 'joyous'. She said: 'These photos are not in the least shocking. They show a young woman sunbathing topless, like millions of women you see on beaches. 'They were not making any special effort to conceal themselves. Critcising our magazine is stupid.' Ms Pieau also warned also that Closer had more photos, adding: 'Intimate pictures exist that we haven't published and will not publish. Probably other newspapers will choose to publish them.'

The families were supported by more than 300 friends and well-wishers - many with tears in their eyes as they shook their heads when the coffins passed by. The cortege was escorted at walking pace past the memorial garden, where it paused briefly next to a Union flag hung at half mast.

Speaking about the way in which Pte Wroe’s life was taken he said: 'I think it proves one thing that, even though what happened, that our guys will help anybody, they will come to somebody’s aid no matter what. 'It is just the nature that we are and the way that we are and the way that we are taught in that we don’t see people struggle and Tom Wroe was an ambassador for that really.' Lt Keaveney, from Huddersfield, said he travelled down to Oxfordshire with a group of people to pay tribute to the man he knew as a 'keen and eager' young man. 'He was a keen individual, a comedian sometimes, a cheeky guy, but with one of those personalities that you couldn’t fail to like him, always willing to learn, always willing to teach, because he experienced quite a lot as a cadet and he used to pass that on to the other kids that were coming through, just an out and out genuine, brilliant young man.'

An eminent former Great Ormond Street cardiologist has been found guilty of inappropriate and sexually motivated conduct by a medical disciplinary tribunal. The tribunal decided that Philipp Bonhoeffer, who was dismissed from the famous hospital in May 2010, was guilty of a string of incidents which included caressing a young boy and writing a love letter to a teenager. A fitness to practise panel of the Medical Practitioners Tribunal Service in Manchester also found that the top child doctor had behaved in an inappropriate manner towards youngsters in Kenya. Professor Bonhoeffer denies the findings and allegations of the tribunal and says he has no intention of resuming his medical practise in the UK. The panel decided today which facts it found proved against Professor Bonhoeffer, 50, and will go on to consider on Monday whether it considers his fitness to practise is impaired. It decided that while he was working at Hospital Necker, a teaching hospital in Paris, from 1995 to 1997, he regularly visited the home of DT and ET, and gave violin lessons to their son, FT, who was about eight- to 10-years-old. He sometimes shared a bedroom with FT, and put his hands on FT’s legs on several occasions. On a date in or around February 1997, he went into the bedroom of FT, then 10 years- old, and sat next to him on his bed while he was apparently sleeping. The eminent doctor worked at Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children . The top doctor is accused of inappropriate conduct . He caressed his whole body in actions which were sexually motivated, the panel decided. It did not find proved an allegation that he admitted to ET that he had a paedophile tendency, or that he said he hoped some children in Kenya would never speak of what had happened to them, or words to that effect. Professor Bonhoeffer was employed by Great Ormond Street from 2001 to May 24 2010 as a consultant cardiologist, and from 2002 as head of cardiology. From 2003 to 2008 he was chairman of the medical board of the UK-based charity The Chain of Hope. Between 1993 and 2008, he travelled to Kenya to undertake charitable medical work, including, from 2005 onwards, through The Chain of Hope. The panel found proved that in 1995, during an overnight stay at a camp in the Marsabit District of Kenya, he placed his hand inside the lower clothing of A, who was 13 at the time, and touched his genital area. This behaviour was sexually motivated, and when he told A he was a doctor and was trying to find his femoral vein, this was intended to mislead, and an abuse of his professional position, the panel decided. During the same trip, he told A that he would make sure he went to high school, and would support him to do so, conduct which was inappropriate and sexually motivated, the panel said. It also found proved that in 1998 he wrote to A, then aged around 16, saying he loved him, and began to pay his high school fees, continuing to provide him with money and gifts until 2008. The panel also found that in August 1998 the professor arranged for young Kenyan male children to stay with him in a flat at the Mater Hospital, Nairobi, provided to him on his trips to Kenya for charity work. Those staying with him included A, then 16, and C, then about 15, who had been his patient. The panel found proved that on the first night of A's stay at the flat, he shared a bed with A, and touched him without A's consent, telling him afterwards that such conduct was normal and acceptable in Europe. During the visit, he also shared a bed with C, conduct which was inappropriate and sexually motivated, the panel found. Professor Bonhoeffer was also found, between 2001 and 2008, to have arranged for Kenyan male children and young male adults, to whom he was providing financial support and gifts, to stay with him in the flat. He was found to have shared a bed with G, who was aged between 10 and 17. In August 2008, at the flat, he kissed F, aged 10 or 11, the younger brother of C, on the mouth, the panel found. The Medical Protection Society issued a statement from Prof Bonhoeffer which said: 'I am no longer participating in the GMC process. 'My reasons are set out in a letter to the GMC's chief executive, Mr Niall Dickson, which I disclose. 'I will be making no further comment.' The letter, dated May 3, from lawyers RadcliffesLeBrasseur, said he maintained his denial of the allegations. 'He has no intention of resuming the practice of medicine in the United Kingdom. 'He no longer has any confidence in the fairness of the process or, given the history of the case, that the proceedings will be concluded in a timely way. 'Moreover, he has come to understand that, even when he is exonerated, he would not be able to resume the practice of medicine in the United Kingdom, even if he wished to do so. Confidence in him has been very seriously, if not irretrievably, damaged already by adverse publicity. 'It is clear that the planned hearings, particularly if Professor Bonhoeffer attends, will attract considerable further publicity.

But some felt more than a little embarrassed to put Tesco’s blue-and-white-striped Value range in their baskets. So much so, that the supermarket was forced to ditch the range completely. The chain has admitted it relaunched the budget own-brand because shoppers ‘didn’t feel comfortable’ about picking it up. Britain's biggest retailer, Tesco, has ditched its basic Value range . It has been replaced with a newly . designed Everyday Value range, which features brightly coloured, more . upmarket-looking packaging. Andy Yaxley, commercial director of Tesco . Fresh Food, said: ‘Embarrassed is probably the wrong word. But customers told us that they questioned the quality of the Value brand because of the packaging and some didn’t feel comfortable putting it in their trolleys. ‘Tesco was the first supermarket to launch a value range. . .but customer needs have changed. We have listened closely to what our customers want and Everyday Value will provide products that taste better, look better and are healthier.’ Facesaver: The old and new labels. Tesco admitted that 'customers didn't feel comfortable' about putting value products in their shopping baskets . The new design features a smarter . white and orange livery and forms part of sweeping changes that include a . revamped premium range. The . retail giant said it is introducing posh bottled water which it has . shipped in from Norway – the Voss brand will sell at a hefty  £4.89 a . bottle. The changes, which have been trialled over the past six months, are part of a £1 billion investment which will see 25pc of the grocer’s store space refitted this year. It is also re-launching its frozen food department for the first time in 5 years, kitting its bakeries out with wood fittings and trialling patisseries. Clothing will be relegated to the back of the store to make way for fruit and vegetables at the entrance. Customers will also be able to use a new scanning system so they will not need to pass items through tills. They will be able to scan their products as they put them into bags in their trolleys and then pay at the end. It also found that shoppers felt its meat aisle was too clinical, so chief executive Phil Clarke had the shelves tilted at an angle to improve visibility and made the aisle ‘warmer’. He said: ‘We are starting to seen green roots of progress.

A middle-class couple who lived in luxury and sent their son to a posh private school illegally claimed £11,500 in benefits to fund their lifestyle. Mother Gaye Williams, 38, lied to the authorities about being a single parent in need of extra financial support to ensure she was eligible for council, housing and tax benefits.

The court heard . that Gaye was the ‘brains’ behind the scam, while her husband was ‘very . hard working with considerable earning ability’. Judge Jamie Tabor told Mrs Williams: . ‘You are an intelligent woman and you decided to defraud the public, . which was unnecessary. Members of the public would say it is a lot of . money - and it is.' As well as lying to the Department of . Work and Pensions, Williams claimed housing and council tax benefit . while living in Hempsted, Gloucester, between November 2008 and January . 2009, and similar benefits from Tewkesbury Borough Council while living . in the village of Highnam between March and August 2009. The total paid out by the three authorities was about £11,500. Steve . Young, defending Mrs Williams, a former estate agent, said publicity of . the case had caused her distress and made it difficult for her to work. He . added that the dogs had not been paid for with the benefits but that . the couple’s son bought the pets with money he won at a horticultural . fair. But Judge Tabor told Mrs Williams it was unlikely publicity was the reason she could not find employment. Gaye Williams, left, and Glyn Williams, right, both admitted to the frauds after pretending to be separated . He said: ‘In fact it is because you committed serious offences.’ Judge . Jamie Tabor ordered Mrs Williams to do 180 hours unpaid work and Mr . Williams to do 125 hours, telling them it was a ‘sad and sorry tale’. Judge Tabor said: ‘I expect the Department of Work and Pensions will get the money back in the next two or three years.’ Sabiha Pathan, defending Mr Williams, 47, told the court he had been working hard towards repayment. The benefit fraudsters avoided prison at Gloucester Crown Court and instead were sentenced to unpaid work . Judge Tabor told him: ‘Your wife is an intelligent woman and she knew what she was doing. ‘You knew what she was doing by letting her put the money in your bank account. You allowed it to happen. ‘I’m quite satisfied we will not see you here again. I know this has been agony for you.’ As well as unpaid work, Mr Williams was ordered to pay back £2,500.

German schoolchildren preparing for the invasion of the UK during the Second World War were given a textbook portraying Hitler as a man of peace and the British as evil warmongers. The bizarre 1942 publication - which was written in English - attempts to give children an idea of what to expect when visiting the British Isles in the event of a successful Nazi take-over. In it, a variety of bold claims are made, accusing Jews of running the British . press and statements about English people secretly supporting Fascism, but it does reflect Hitler's admiration for the work of William Shakespeare. Taking the peace: Designed to prepare schoolchildren for life in Britain under German occupation, the text book makes a series of bizarre claims . Embellished: The textbook grossly exaggerates the gulf between the rich and the poor, complete with his cartoon which supposedly depicts how the British upper classes treat the impoverished . How the other half live: This image, left, is designed to give an 'insight' into how the lower classes were housed in slums, while another chapter, right, focuses on the 'decline' of agriculture . Sentiments of anti-semitism: Predictably, the guide book also includes a section on how the Jews are supposedly regarded in England . Laughably, Hitler . is portrayed as a 'great peacemaker' while English ‘atrocities’ against . India and Ireland are described in gory detail - with no mention at all of . Nazi death camps. And the . gulf between the upper and working classes is greatly exaggerated, with . whole chapters dedicated to the Victorian slums of London. To emphasise their claims, the text is accompanied by strange . illustrations, including a cartoon of an . aristocrat trampling over poor people. Sections have titles like ‘A Document of Misery’, ‘Decline and Fall of the British Empire’ and ‘England and the Jews’. 'Great peacemaker': The book portrays Adolf Hitler (left) in a favourable light. It also reflects Der Führer's admiration for the work of the Bard, William Shakespeare (right) However, the textbook also celebrates . various aspects of British culture, including the countryside and the . works of Shakespeare. A picture of the Bard’s birthplace, Stratford-Upon-Avon, Warkwickshire, is even splashed across the front cover. Hitler, a notorious fan of the playwright, even dedicated a section of the text to his role as a British cultural icon. The . book, which was designed to be distributed among German teens ahead of a . planned invasion, celebrates Hitler as a man of peace. One . section reads: 'He [Hitler] made before the German people and the world . several offers of peace, in words which were unequivocal, emotional and . idealistic. 'He was called a . liar in the world press. He offered France friendship saying that there . was no further cause of quarrel between their two peoples. 'The French press spat on his outstretched hand and increased their military strength.' The . 1942 book was entitled ‘Hirts Englandkundliches Lesebuch fur die .

Trina Rocker, 41, had chaperoned the student’s trip to Washington, D.C., last year, and the two had sex in a laundry closet at a Holiday Inn in Richmond, Virginia. The Haines City, Florida woman was arrested Monday after her relationship was uncovered by the boy’s parents.

Landmark Christian Church co-pastor Steve Carter told Tampa Bay Online that all teachers are put through a background check before they are hired. ‘Being a smaller Christian school, we have to think that there would be less chance of it here, but as we found out, shockingly, there is a chance of it to be here.’ He said there were no more than 90 students at the central Florida school.

When 26-year-old Sophie Linfield put on her blue British Airways cabin crew suit and headed to work earlier this year, she could never have expected the Transatlantic trip she was working on to end with a proposal from one of Britain's wealthiest entrepreneurs. But this was no indecent proposal. Sophie, who had been tending to Ultimo chief Michelle Mone in the First Class cabin, made such an impression on the billionaire businesswoman that Mone handed the BA employee her details and implored her to enter a competition she was holding to find 'real women' to model the lingerie brand's latest collections. Bemused Sophie put the experience aside. But when she landed, something compelled her to call Mone's PA, who asked Sophie to send in a natural photograph of herself and fill in an entry form - which she did. Winning curves: Air hostess Sophie Linfield (left) winner of the Real Women competition and gorgeous Angela Wheeler (right) 'I got my brother's girlfriend to take a photo of me in the garden, just wearing jeans and T-shirt,' Sophie says. 'But I didn't hear anything back for a few weeks, so I just chalked it up as one of those crazy things that happen. But then after a month, I had a call saying I'd won. I couldn't believe it.' Sophie, who has never modelled, says she had always felt lacking in confidence when it came to body image. All natural: Finalist Dal Dosanjh (left) was chosen for her shape next to Becky Davenport (right) Beautiful: Lisa MacLachlan (left) was picked to be in the top 12 along with Leah Morris (right) 'I had never posed in underwear - I would never have considered doing anything like this. I was terrified ahead of the shoot, and I really didn't enjoy posing. I felt awful, and I was so nervous. 'Fortunately, all ten of us taking part in the shoot had been chatting all week on Facebook, so when it came to posing on the day, I felt like I was among friends. 'The photographer was so nice, and Michelle came down on the day, which was lovely.' Despite her nerves, Sophie says that posing in her underwear gave her a huge and unexpected confidence boost. 'It made me realise that we are all different. Women come in all shapes and sizes,' she said. 'We can't all have bodies like celebrities - we don't have chefs and personal trainers. But everyone is beautiful in their own way.' Such was the transformation that . Sophie says she would now be happy to give her delighted fiance Nick, . also 26, a treat ahead of their wedding next year. 'I . have never been one for nice underwear,' she says. 'I have a drawer of . mismatched knickers and bras. But Ultimo gave us the lingerie we were . wearing on the day, and a few other nice pieces, so my underwear drawer . has been transformed.'

He is said to have preferred the company of his pupils to fellow teachers . Jeremy Forrest regularly exchanged text and online messages with girl pupils at his previous school and sent them birthday cards, it emerged yesterday. The married 30-year-old was said to prefer the company of pupils to fellow teachers and treated them like his ‘little sisters’. One pupil said on Twitter: ‘The guy used to give me a birthday card every year, he never forgot! Now I think he just wanted to take me to France.’ Another, who is now 19, admitted she was his favourite and he would treat her ‘like a little sister’ encouraging her to take up singing and discover new bands. Once he even went to watch her sing at a competition out of school hours and encouraged her to sing songs by his favourite band, Nirvana, and wept at a farewell meal for his class. In an echo of his relationship with Megan Stammers, he sat on a plane next to the girl on a school trip, though she insists that he was not trying to groom her. Meanwhile, Forrest’s family have insisted that his decision to flee to France on a cross-Channel ferry with his pupil last week was completely out of character. They claim it was due to a deterioration in his mental health and he is depressed. But his behaviour at Bishop Justus School in Bromley, Kent, where he worked until July 2009, raises disturbing questions in light of what he has now done. One former pupil, who was in Forrest’s tutor group for four years between 11 and 16, described how he used to text her in his spare time, send her online messages and treat her like his ‘favourite’. The former pupil, who is now aged 19, said: ‘He was very shy but seemed more comfortable around his students. He was more outgoing around us. 'On his lunch breaks he would stay in his room and listen to music or help the children who were struggling. ‘He didn’t go to the staff room very much with the other teachers, he kept himself to himself.’ Runaway: Megan Stammers in a picture she posted on the internet. She disappeared with Forrest last week after the pair took a ferry to France . But she said she didn’t think Mr Forrest was ‘grooming’ her for a relationship in any way and insists his behaviour was innocent, and he was never inappropriate towards her. ‘He was just friendly and always offering his help. Not just to me, but to others too,’ she said. ‘Everyone at the school respected him, teachers and pupils. The naughty kids were all put into his class because he was the only one who could handle them. ‘We’d all go on his blog and listen to his music – it was weird seeing your teacher like that. Some of my friends fancied him – but he’s not my type. ‘What’s happened is a surprise because he would always post pictures on Facebook of his wife. He seemed really proud of her. He said he’d invite me to the wedding but I never got an invite.’ The teenager went on a geography and history school trip to Italy with Forrest, where they got to know each other well and became good friends, sitting next to each other on the plane. He also attended the pupil’s end-of-year ball and organised a dinner out for his tutor group after he left, where she said he became was tearful about leaving. She added: ‘Friends are being really mean about him on Twitter, calling him a paedo and stuff, but I don’t think it’s fair. I think he must have really loved this girl to go off with her.’ First pictures: These stills taken from CCTV . camera footage filmed aboard a Dover to Calais ferry last Thursday show Forrest with his arm round  Megan in one picture and walking hand in hand with her in the . other . The girl’s mother agreed that she never suspected anything of Forrest. ‘We met his whole family, they were lovely,’ she said. ‘We honestly couldn’t say a bad word about him – you couldn’t have asked for a nicer man. We are totally shocked.’ Another former pupil of Forrest, said on Twitter: ‘I’m sad his (sic) gone, now I’m going to miss the birthday cards every year, the chats we had.’ She later added: ‘The guy used to give me a birthday card every year, he never forgot! Now I think he just wanted to take me to France.’ Alias: Jeremy Forrest is a keen musician and performs under the name Jeremy Ayre . Other pupils tweeted that they are not concerned about Megan’s safety because she is with Forrest and he will ‘keep her safe’. On Twitter, a girl who describes herself as one of Megan’s ‘best friends’ responded to posts about her being in danger. On Saturday she tweeted: ‘He’ll keep her safe.’ Another friend responded: ‘At least there (sic) happy.’ However, one pupil pointed out: ‘They may be happy but think about megan’s family. He needs to just bring her back.’ Jeremy’s father, Jim Forrest, who runs an IT business, also defended his son, saying that he was not a ‘violent or evil’ person. He said: ‘We have been worried about him for some time and noticed him going further downhill for more than – let’s just say – a matter of months. He’d been in a bad state for a long time. ‘So we don’t understand why the school didn’t step in and do anything. We are very disappointed.’","Married 30-year-old said to prefer to company of pupils to fellow teachers .

Prince Philip dubbed it 'bloody daft' and critics say that the idea of debutantes presenting themselves to the aristocracy is outdated and elitist, but for certain sections of British society the Queen Charlotte's Ball is the ultimate summer event. Dubbed the 'crowning event of the London Season' the guest list is hand-picked with care: only young women from the richest families are invited to the September ball where, after months of careful preparation and spending over £2500 on each ticket, the young debutantes are able to show off their skills in poise and elegance. In the past debutante balls were seen as a rite of passage for the young women of the upper classes, an opportunity to introduce themselves to society and seek out a potential suitor, but for today's debutantes the Season is seen as an opportunity to wear a designer gown, party their way around Europe, and do a little something for charity. Debutantes Maria Austin, Amelia Simmons, Sophie Bonello, Zoe Rawson, and Georgina Riddle (L-R) attend a dress-fitting for Queen Charlotte's Ball in central London . Queen Charlotte's Ball was introduced by King George III in 1780 as a way to celebrate his wife’s birthday, and a huge cake was one of the highlights. Up until 1958, young debutantes used to be presented to the Queen at . Buckingham Palace, until Prince Philip pointed out . that it was ‘bloody daft’. Today the 'daft' debutantes, all aged between 17 and 20, follow the traditional Queen Charlotte's cake in to the ballroom where the girls perform special curtsies to the nine-tier-high gateaux before being judged on their posture, elegance and pace by the room. The event involves meetings with aristocracy, etiquette classes, and charity fund-raising, and the 'deb of the year' is chosen according to 'who has worked hardest’ during fund-raising activities throughout the season and shown the most enthusiasm (she is usually the prettiest too, although that is not an official judging requirement). The debutantes, all hand-picked girls from rich backgrounds, rehearse their entrance to the ball dressed in couture gowns . Debutante Alice Palmer is told off for walking too fast by former debutante Patricia Woodall as she rehearses. The girls make a grand entrance walking in one by one and are judged on their posture, elegance and pace . Brunette Talitha Piggott was named Debutante of the Year at Queen Charlotte's Ball on September 14, 2012 . The young women spend months preparing for their dramatic entrance in to the ballroom and go to several dress fittings to make sure their couture gowns cling perfectly. Prior to the event older debutantes are on hand to guide and critique the girls on their dress, dancing and pace around the ballroom and on the day an army of professional hair and make-up artists are on hand to make sure that the girls are glowing, setting off perfectly coiffed up 'dos with diamond studded tiaras and precious jewellery. And on the night, once the deb of the year award has been handed out - this year Talitha Piggott won the accolade - the girls are free to dance the night away with their families, friends and the handsome male guests, dubbed the 'Debs' delights'.

A former boxer who stabbed his great-nephew in the neck with a wine glass because he didn't 'respect his elders' has been found guilty of murder. Raymond Dupree, 68, was today told he could die in prison after he was jailed for life for the murder of 20-year-old Ryan King. Mr King was stabbed at a party on a sprawling rural estate after Dupree said other young revellers were not 'showing enough respect'. Raymond Dupree, left, has been told he could die in prison after he was jailed for the murder of Ryan King, right . It took just two hours for a jury to find Dupree guilty of murder. Mr Justice Roderick Evans jailed Dupree for life and fixed a minimum term of 13 years. He told Dupree: 'I accept by fixing this period of 13 years you may not be released and you will die in custody.' Mr King is said to have calmly stuck up for the 13 and 14-year-old girls when Dupree complained about music being played in the early hours of August 21 last year. The court heard that the party was being held at the luxury Snurridge Manor House near South Molton in north Devon to celebrate Mr King’s pregnant mother’s 40th birthday. Witnesses said Dupree, a former boxing coach, was clenching a glass when he punched Mr King in the neck as the party began to quieten down at around 3am. As Mr King fell to the floor clutching his wound, Dupree showed him no remorse, saying: 'I’ve done him.' He then left and walked home. Slashed his throat: Dupree, a former boxer (pictured) only realised what he had done when he heard Mr King's mother screaming 'No, no, not my baby' at the hospital . A terrified Mr King told shocked onlookers that he thought he was going to die as friends frantically called for help. Mr King, who was from London, was taken to hospital but later died from his injuries. Bespectacled Dupree, wearing a white T-shirt and blue tracksuit bottoms, stood expressionless as the jury foreman announced his guilt. It then emerged that Dupree had a long history of criminal convictions dating back to being a juvenile in the 1960s. These include offences against the person, public order and possession of firearms and offensive weapons. He has served sentences in borstal and prison, the court was told. The judge also heard of the effect Mr King’s death has had upon his mother, Lisa Wilson, and family in victim impact statements. Prosecutor Simon Laws QC said: 'Lisa Wilson describes the unbearable grief that the loss of her son has brought to her and the devastation it has caused the wider family.' The family were celebrating the birthday of Mr King's, right, mother at the Snurridge Manor House, left, when a row broke out. Dupree smashed a wine glass into the young man's neck . Adam Vaitilingam QC, defending, did not offer any personal mitigation on behalf of Dupree. At the start of the trial, the prosecutor said Dupree 'grossly over-reacted to a trivial dispute'. Mr Laws said: 'There was simply no reason for Dupree to have used any force at all, still less the fatal force that he actually used. 'Mr King lost his life quite needlessly. His death was a product of Dupree’s bad temper and his pride.' Dupree and Mr King were among around 30 people celebrating Ms Wilson’s birthday at the manor house, which was owned by Dupree’s sister. Revellers said the party was 'going well', with music, a buffet and karaoke. But, as guests began to leave the party, witnesses said the atmosphere began to change. Mr Laws told the court: 'Dupree was behaving in a manner which was, at the very least, overbearing. 'Mr King intervened on behalf of a young girl that was bearing the brunt of the defendant’s temper.' He said Mr King asked Dupree to leave the girl alone, prompting Dupree to say his relative should 'respect his elders'. Police at the scene of the incident. The defendant told police it had been a 'family thing' that got out of hand . Dupree had apparently become angry that one girl had broken two glasses, and that the teenagers, who had been drinking, should have been in bed. The defendant, who was stopped by police as he walked home from the party, initially said the incident had been an accident, and that it was a 'family thing' that had got out of hand. He later said his great-nephew had 'offered him outside for a fight' before launching a pre-emptive attack on the 20-year-old. Dupree told the court that he 'could not remember' the details of the incident, including whether he was holding a wine glass at the time he lashed out. He told jurors: 'I became aware (of the seriousness of Mr King’s injury) when I got to the hospital and I heard my niece (Mr King’s mother) scream out: ""Oh, my boy, my baby boy"". 'Ryan was in an adjoining (hospital) room. When I heard my niece, I said: ""What’s going on?"" 'A policeman told me to be quiet, because they (Mr King’s family) don’t know we were there.' Dupree told jurors he did remember telling some children at the party to go to bed. 'You killed him in a fit of temper because you were not getting the respect and deference you . thought you deserved, first by a 13-year-old girl and second your . great-nephew Ryan' Judge Justice Roderick Evans . He said Mr King later challenged him, talking in a 'sarcastic' manner before the 68-year-old admitted offering his young relative to 'go outside', as though to fight. Dupree said: 'He (Mr King) said: ""Come on, then"". He took half a step towards me, I got up and hit him.' The defendant said he threw one punch, a right-arm hook, which he demonstrated to the jury. Passing sentence, the judge said Dupree had killed Mr King because he had lost his temper with some of the youngsters at the party. The judge said: 'You killed him in a fit of temper and annoyance because you were not getting the respect and deference you thought you deserved, first by a 13-year-old girl and second your great-nephew Ryan. 'When he tried to intervene and calm the situation and calm you down, you became aggressive, abusive and violent. 'You thrust a wine glass into his neck which cut his jugular vein and in reality he bled to death on the floor of his grandmother’s kitchen. 'The fact you killed him in front of the people that were there, particularly the young girls, is an aggravating feature of this case.' The judge said he accepted Dupree had not intended to kill Mr King but he had wanted to cause him 'really serious harm' when he attacked him. Following the verdict, Detective Inspector Dave Thorne, who led the investigation, said: 'Justice has prevailed in this tragic case and Raymond Dupree has been convicted of murder. 'It was a needless attack which was unprovoked and undeserved with fatal consequences to Ryan King, a young man with his whole life ahead of him. 'Ryan was part of an extensive but close-knit family with many good friends and was liked by all. 'The trauma and loss that family and friends have experienced is beyond comprehension and although a conviction has been achieved, people will live with this loss for the rest of their lives. 'I would like to thank the prosecution team for their professionalism and the family for their calmness and resilience through this traumatic process.' Mr King’s family did not wish to comment as they left court.","Raymond Dupree stabbed Ryan King in the neck, telling him he didn't 'respect his elders'

Confusion reigns on the first day of the Labour party conference as Ed Miliband faced further questions about his ability to win the next election. Two years after Ed Miliband was named Labour leader in Manchester, the party is back in the city and still publicly confused about who is in charge. And shadow chancellor Ed Balls is embroiled in a football controversy over claims he deliberately dived to secure a penalty in a match against journalists. Scroll down for video . Ed Balls ends up face down in the mud during the annual Labour party v Media football match at Salford City Football Ground . The Labour XI were 2-0 up when Mr Balls made a break down the wing and was clipped by a journalists. After apparently taking time to consider his options, the shadow chancellor fell to the ground. One onlooker said: ‘I have never seen anyone go down so slowly and dramatically in my life.’ Going: Ed Balls is clipped by a rival player . Going: The shadow chancellor throws in some theatrics as he tumbles to the floor . Gone: Face down in the mud again, even his own team mates said the dive was questionable . The move secured a penalty, which Mr Balls slotted home. The final scoreline was 3-0. Even colleague Andy Burnham, the shadow health secretary, said the penalty was ‘questionable’. Later Mr Balls was at pains to stress it was not ‘one of my goals’ to become Labour leader. Running for the leadership: Ed Balls today insisted he 'does not give a toss' about becoming Labour leader . He told Huffington Post: ‘If I’m honest for you, personally, it doesn’t matter, I actually don’t care, it’s not something which I think about, worry about care about at all whether I’m leader of prime minister, it’s not part of my mindset, its not part of my goals. ‘If I say to you I rule it out, I don’t think you’d believe me. If I say to you it’s very unlikely, I think that’s totally honest, I don’t care. I don’t give a toss. I really don’t give a toss.” Yet the question of the Labour leadership continued to dominate. David Miliband, who was defeated by his brother Ed, appeared to suggest that the public would prefer him in charge. Asked about a poll commissioned by the Conservatives which found three quarters of voters think David would make a better leader, he replied: ‘The most important thing to remember is that the grass always seems greener on the other side of the fence.’ To add to the sense of . confusion, Labour’s deputy leader Harriet Harman went on Sky News to . rail against the Prime Minister David Cameron, and declared: ‘If you're . completely out of touch like David Miliband is you cannot make the right . decisions.’ After being corrected by reporter Joey Jones, Ms Harman exclaimed: ‘Oh goodness me’ before launching back into her soundbite. Wakey wakey: The excitement of Yvette Cooper's speech proved too much for shadow business secretary Chuka Umunna (left), shadow health minister Diane Abbott (centre) and shadow immigration Chris Bryant (right) Earlier speeches from the platform left many in the conference hall underwhelmed or distracted. Shadow transport secretary Maria Eagle was spotted taking pictures of her sister Angela during her speech. And during shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper's speech left her coleagues struggling to stay awake. Chris Bryant, shadow immigration minister was spotted yawning, while Diane Abbott, the shadow health minister, and Chuka Umunna, the shadow business secretary, spent the speech checking their phones. The first day of the Labour party has been dominated by gossip and gaffes about who is in charge . Later this week Ed Miliband is expected to put the stamp on his leadership with a party political broadcast which chronicles his upbringing and contrasts with privately-educated Tories. It includes footage from his childhood and teaching students at Harvard where he is repeatedly called ‘Professor Miliband’.

"By . Emma Reynolds and Will Stewart . UPDATED: . 15:54 EST, 5 March 2012 . Beleaguered: Rupert Murdoch's News Corp could be at the centre of fresh corruption allegations after the FBI allegedly began investigating a Russian firm it used to own . The FBI is reportedly investigating whether a Russian billboard company once owned by Rupert Murdoch's media giant News Corp bribed local officials to get their signs in the best positions. Two sources familiar with the investigation said it it will examine operations at former News Corp subsidiary News Outdoor Russia, according to the Associated Press. The alleged investigation appears to have grown out of the phone hacking scandal, which revealed that journalists at Murdoch-owned newspaper News of the World obtained exclusives by illegally listening to private messages. The two people spoke about the alleged Russian probe on condition of anonymity because they were not authorised to discuss the investigation. The story was reported by Fox News, part of Fox Entertainment, which is owned by News Corp. News Corp sold its majority stake in NOR in July, but the alleged investigation opens another legal battlefield for the New York-based media group. Murdoch's empire is trying to contain the damage from the hacking scandal at News International newspapers News of the World and The Sun as well as from allegations of bribes paid to police and other officials. Sources said FBI investigators are trying to establish whether overseas units of News Corp engaged in corrupt acts or bribery, and, if so, whether those acts were part of a pattern, according to the Wall Street Journal, which is also owned by News Corp. News Corp has said it is cooperating with the UK investigations. Asked if NOR employees engaged in bribery or other acts of corruption while it was a subsidiary of News Corp, a spokesman for the Russian company said: 'This is not possible'. He added: 'News Outdoor Russia was an investment project for News Corp and [News Corp] didn't participate in the operations of the company.' A News Corp spokeswoman declined to comment on the FBI probe in Russia, or to say if the media giant had provided any information to U.S. investigators about the Russian business. Advertising world: News Corp sold its majority stake in billboard company News Outdoor Russia in July . Federal prosecutors and the FBI have yet to reach any conclusions about the Russian affair, according to the people familiar with the U.S. investigation. The U.S. probe began in July to investigate a media report that UK-based employees of News Corp newspapers may have hacked the phone messages of 9/11 victims and their families. Investigators have not found any evidence to support that claim, according to multiple people familiar with the investigation, but investigators have apparently since begun probing possible bribery in Britain and Russia. In written responses to WSJ questions, NOR said it had not been contacted by the FBI and was not aware of such an investigation. 'Over the entire history of the company's activities, both before the alliance with News Corp. and after the sale to the strategic investor, NOR conducted its business within Russian law,' a company spokesman said. NOR was a profitable property for News Corp, which had a majority holding in the Moscow-based billboard company for a decade, until it sold its 79 per cent stake last July. NOR benefited from a burgeoning Russian consumer sector and buildings in big cities wallpapered with ads, becoming one of the largest outdoor-ad companies in Russia. Offloaded: Sources in Russia say that Rupert Murdoch felt uneasy with News Outdoor long before he sought to sell the business . Head of the company Maxim Tkachev was shot outside his office in 2002. He survived the shooting, which occurred months after an executive at a chief rival to NOR, Vladimir Kanevsky, was shot dead at a Moscow intersection. No one was convicted in either case. Two people familiar with the probe said the FBI is looking into the murder of Mr Kanevsky to see if it was connected to any possible corruption at NOR, but they cautioned that it may be difficult to learn anything about the decade-old killing. Mr Tkachev declined to speculate on the shootings. The company later became mired in a tax dispute with Russia's federal tax authorities that it eventually lost. In 2008, News Outdoor Russia's offices were raided by Russian anti-corruption authorities investigating a Moscow city official. NOR was not accused of wrongdoing in that case. That same year, News Corp's Mr. Murdoch made clear he had soured on his investment in Russia. On an earnings call in August 2008, he said that the more successful it was, the higher the likelihood the business would be 'stolen' - but did not say by whom. News Corp valued NOR at more than $1billion when it first began looking to sell it in 2007, though that was before the financial crisis and resulting drop in ad sales. News Corp sold its holding in NOR last July for $270 million. Some multinationals, including Daimler AG and Pinalpina World Transport (Holding) Ltd, have fallen foul in Russia of a U.S. law called the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which prohibits entities with U.S. operations from paying bribes to officials overseas. 'Bribery and corruption': News Corp is at the centre of the hacking scandal in Britain, and is now being investigated in the U.S. and allegedly now Russia . In such cases authorities quickly expand the probe to the company's conduct around the globe. If the FBI find that News Corp engaged in acts of corruption or bribery through NOR, the company could face potential liability even though it no longer owns NOR, lawyers said. The Moscow advertising market is widely suspected of being riddled with corruption, though recent attempts have been made to clean it up. A key factor is the influence of city or state officials in making decisions on prime advertising sites, laying them open to bribery. Sources in Russia say that Rupert Murdoch felt uneasy with News Outdoor long before he sought to sell the business, a deal that went through last year. He made clear his strong desire to unload the Russian operation, evidently feeling uneasy in Moscow compared with China. 'The more I read about investments in Russia the less I like the feel of it. The more successful we'd be in Russia the more vulnerable we'd be to have the business stolen from us, so there we sell now,' he said. Earlier he had got rid of stakes in Russian radio stations Nashe Radio and Ultra. Damaged reputation: The hacking scandal led to the demise of News Corp paper News of the World and is threatening the image of The Sun following journalists' arrests . The sale of News Outdoor took place in July last year and the company was purchased by a pool of investors including Russian giants  VTB Capital and  Alfa Capital Partners. When he sold, News Outdoor owned 50,000 advertising spaces in 85 cities. Its business has suffered during the economic crisis with revenues plunging to 2.5billion roubles from 4.5 billion in 2009. In 2008, work at News Outdoor was paralysed by a raid from by Interior Ministry investigators probing financial documents amid suggestions of a bitter conflict between the company and the Moscow authorities. At the time, company officials said they were victims of 'unscrupulous competition'. In the murky and lucrative world of advertising in Moscow - where the city's potential is seen as untapped compared with New York or London - there are many illegal advertising sites giving them impression of an uncontrolled market. While details have not been disclosed of the FBI probe, the advertising market in Moscow is no stranger to legal actions. Last year Moscow mayor Sergei Sobyanin fired the head of the Moscow advertising committee Vladimir Makarov who was earlier arrested over abuse of office allegations. Investigators accused him in 2009 of illegally doling out at least 131m roubles ($4.3m) in discounts to private companies in the city. Makarov's underling Igor Gavrilov was also arrested the same year on charges of accepting a 3.25 million ruble bribe from the head of a private company for prolonging city advertising contracts. Gavrilov served three-and-a-half years in jail for extortion. Makarov spent six months in custody and was released pending further investigations in February 2010.","Alleged investigation seems to have grown from phone-hacking scandal .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 08:45 EST, 30 September 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 20:04 EST, 2 October 2012 . Following a University of Tennessee student’s near death after undergoing a so-called alcohol enema the school has suspended the campus fraternity until at least 2015. The Pi Kappa Alpha house on Knoxville's campus will close on Oct. 7 with the national fraternity notified by the university on Friday that it is voluntarily surrendering its charter. Knoxville Police said that one fraternity member was admitted to the hospital earlier this week with a dangerously high level of intoxication after undergoing what students call 'butt chugging.' A dozen people were later cited for underage drinking. Closing doors: The University of Tenensee Pi Kappa Alpha chapter will close on the Knoxville campus, their house pictured, after a student's near death this month . Brink of death: Alexander Broughton, 20, was given an 'alcohol enema' during a frat party at the University of Tennessee according to police . Twenty-year-old Alexander P. Broughton has denied that that he received an alcohol enema, though police records dispute that claim. Broughton's father has said his son has recovered and returned to classes. Thanks to the fraternity's drunken exploits, the bizarre way of getting drunk is giving parents, administrators and health care workers a new fear. When Broughton was delivered to the hospital after midnight on Sept. 22, his blood alcohol level was measured at 0.448 per cent — nearly six times the intoxication that defines drunken driving in the state. Injuries to his rectum led hospital officials to fear he had been sodomized. Police documents show that when an officer interviewed a fellow fraternity member about what happened, the student said the injuries had been caused by an alcohol enema, known among students as 'butt chugging.' 'It is believed that members of the fraternity were utilizing rubber tubing inserted into their rectums as a conduit for alcohol,' according to a police report. Frat boys: The PIKE chapter at the university campus in Knoxville has been in trouble in the past for hazing . While Broughton told police he remembered participating in a drinking game with fellow members of the Pi Kappa Alpha chapter, he denied having an alcohol enema. Police concluded otherwise from evidence they found at the frat house, including boxes of Franzia Sunset Blush wine. Investigators also found three other students passed out in their rooms from drinking. 'He also had no recollection of . losing control of his bowels and defecating on himself,' according to a . university police report that includes photos of the mess left behind in . the fraternity house after the party. Broughton did not respond to a cellphone message seeking comment on Friday. The university responded with swift . investigation and a decision on Friday to shutter the fraternity. The . national Pi Kappa Alpha fraternity organization also accepted the . withdrawal of the campus charter. Alcohol enemas have been the punch lines . of YouTube videos, a stunt in a 'Jackass' movie and a song by the punk . band NOFX called 'Party Enema.' But Corey Slovis, chairman of department . of emergency medicine at Vanderbilt University Medical Center, said . actually going through with the deed can have severe consequences. 'It's something that offers no advantages, while at the same time risking someone's life,' he said. The procedure bypasses the stomach, accelerating the absorption rate, Slovis said. Pouring the alcohol through a funnel can increase the amount of alcohol consumed because it's hard to gauge how much is going in. 'When you're dumping it into your rectum, often via a funnel, one or two ounces seems like such a minuscule amount,' he said. Ingesting more can create unconsciousness quite quickly, he explained. Irresponsible: Police found empty boxes of wine strewn around the frat house along with three others passed out in their rooms from drinking . The effects have been fatal in at least one case. An autopsy performed after the death of a 58-year-old Texas man in 2004 showed he had been given an enema with enough sherry to have a blood alcohol level of 0.47 per cent. Negligent homicide charges were later dropped against his wife, who said she gave him the enema. Students walking across campus this week generally responded with sighs and eye rolls when asked about the allegations. 'It's like a big joke,' said Erica Davis, a freshman from Hendersonville. 'Because who does that?' Gordon Ray, a senior from Morristown, said the details of the case caught him off guard, but not the fact that fraternity members would be overdoing it with alcohol. 'It is definitely over the top,' said Ray. 'But it doesn't surprise me, I don't guess.' The harm the news has done to the university's national reputation was on the mind of several students. 'If someone wants to be stupid, then they should do it where it won't affect anyone else,' said Marlon Alessandra, freshman from Independence, Va. James E. Lange, who coordinates alcohol and drug abuse prevention strategies at San Diego State University, said alcohol enemas aren't a common occurrence on campuses, though normal consumption still contributes to hundreds of student deaths annually. And many of those can be attributed to reckless attitudes about the consequences of heavy drinking, he said. 'It's not unusual to hear that students are drinking to get drunk,' he said. Lange said he hopes students don't draw the wrong lessons from the University of Tennessee incident. 'Students and people in general are pretty good at denying that they are at risk for whatever happened to someone else,' he said. 'So they can look at something like this and say 'I'm OK because I would never do that.' 'However, they may be drinking heavily, or doing things like mixing alcohol with prescription meds that is putting them at serious risk,' he said. To Tennessee freshman Cody Privett of Sevierville, there's nothing appealing about the incident on his campus. 'It's stupid, it's an unfortunate situation,' said Privett, of Sevierville. 'I mean there's partying, and then there's other things.' It is not the first time the PIKE chapter has been involved in trouble at the university. In . 2008, the chapter was placed on administrative suspension after a . hazing incident where pledges were allegedly asked to do push-ups on . broken glass. Three . students were later hospitalized with staph infections. A member of the . fraternity said pledges were asked perform a 'lateral ab movement' known . as 'bows and toes' on the bathroom floor. The university's Office of Student Judicial Affairs charged the chapter with hazing and it pleaded guilty. After . completing its suspension, the chapter served several months of . probation. The international PIKE organization investigated and kicked . out 25 of the chapter's active members.","Student Alexander Broughton, 20, was brought to hospital unconscious last week .

Don't get excited: Authorities have already said they don't think the timeline adds up and that it's unlikely Hoffa's body is there. He was last seen July 30, 1975, outside a restaurant in Oakland County, more than 30 miles to the west. Recently retired Detroit FBI chief Andrew Arena is among the doubters that the latest report will check out. 'You've got to check it out, but this doesn't sound right,' he told The Associated Press. 'The working theories that have developed over the years, this really doesn't fit any of those. Evidence: Roseville Police Department detectives carry soil samples removed from the site of the dig . Unearthed: On July 16, 2003, authorities searched under a backyard pool in Hampton Township, Michigan . Other attempts: In May of 2004, investigators ripped up floorboards of a home in the Detroit suburbs where one-time Jimmy Hoffa ally Frank Sheeran claims to have killed him . Hunt continues: In 2006, searchers in formation inspected a field at Hidden Dreams Farm in Milford Township, Michigan . 'If this was the mob and they killed somebody, I just don't see them burying the body basically at the intersection of a residential neighborhood with this guy standing there.' Berlin said he's not claiming it's Hoffa under the slab, but they are 'investigating a body that may be at the location.' Neighbors say that the house where authorities are searching for Hoffa's body was a possible gambling den in 1975. They . recalled seeing cars coming and going from the home at strange hours, . however, the family of four that lived there moved away before police . closed in. A scan by . ground-penetrating radar confirmed that the earth below the concrete pad . had been disturbed and that there is likely 'something' down there. Media circus: Reporters and other onlookers flood the Roseville, Michigan, home as authorities drill for soil samples . Tourist attraction: Onlookers stop to take pictures at the alleged burial site in Roseville, Michigan . Waiting: Police officers stand around as the floor of a Roseville, Michigan shed is drilled for soil samples in the latest attempt to uncover the remains of Jimmy Hoffa . Feisty and iron-willed in contract talks, Hoffa was an acquaintance of mobsters and adversary to federal officials. He spent time in prison for jury tampering. The day he disappeared, Hoffa was supposed to meet with a New Jersey Teamsters boss and a Detroit mafia captain. He was declared legally dead in 1982. Previous tips led police to excavate soil in 2006 at a horse farm more than 100 miles north of Detroit, rip up floorboards at a Detroit home in 2004 and search beneath a backyard pool north of the city in 2003. There were even rumors that Hoffa's remains were ground up and tossed into a Florida . swamp, entombed beneath Giants Stadium in New Jersey or obliterated in a . mob-owned fat-rendering plant. Shady past? Neighbors say that the house where authorities are searching for Hoffa's body was a possible gambling den in 1975 . Stadium burial? Self-described hit man Donald Frankos claimed Hoffa was buried under Giants Stadium - which was demolished in 2010 . Jimmy Hoffa waves to delegates at the opening of the Teamsters Union convention at Miami Beach, Florida in 1957 . Roseville is one of several inner-ring communities that grew quickly as unionized auto factory workers left the city in search of nicer homes and bigger yards. News of the latest search has brought attention to the mostly working- and middle-class suburb from the curious and naysayers. Slowly moving vehicles have clogged the residential street as camera-wielding neighbors snapped photos for keepsakes. 'I believe it's him. My sister said it is, and she's a psychic,' said Mike Smith after ambling up to the home Thursday and shying a bit from the yellow police tape stretched across the driveway. One local theory that has endured was that the body was beneath the foundation of a downtown Detroit hockey stadium, said 57-year-old Cindi Frank, who snapped photos Thursday of the driveway. Believed dead: Hoffa was declared legally deceased on July 30, 1982, when he would have been 69 . The daughter of a unionized driver and salesman for a Detroit bakery, Frank remembers conversations about Hoffa while he was alive and rumors about his fate. 'It was a family thing. Every time we'd go somewhere we'd say, ""Hey, I wonder if Jimmy Hoffa is buried there?""' Frank said. 'It's just been one of those unsolved mysteries that's gone on for 30-something years. If he show up in Roseville...' Some think the least likely spot for him to turn up might just be the place he does. 'Maybe the most inconspicuous spot might be the place to stash a body or something,' said 52-year-old Andrew Kacir, who lives across from the taped off driveway. However, the FBI remains skeptical that it's actually Jimmy Hoffa. Former agent John Anthony, who spent years investigating . Hoffa’s disappearance, told WDIV-TV: 'I would say it has no credibility at all. It doesn’t . match up with anything we already know. I'd say it’s just another story - someone . trying to get publicity or looking after a reward.' The tipster came forward months ago after first speaking with Dan Moldea, a journalist and author of the book 'Hoffa Wars,' the Detroit News reported. The . man, who has no mob connections, was simply at the wrong place at the . wrong time when he watched men bury a black bag - which he took to be a . body - days after Hoffa disappeared, Mr Moldea said. Mr Moldea said he, too, is skeptical of the claim. Watch video here .","Teamsters boss last seen at suburban Detroit restaurant on July 30, 1975 .

But according to new research, brides-to-be are ditching fancy foreign trips for their hen nights in favour of cheaper locations at home as the recession bites. For their final night of fun, brides are abandoning expensive weekend breaks in big European capitals like Dublin and Paris and opting instead for just one night away with their friends at British resorts like Brighton and Blackpool. All fired up: Brides-to-be Rochelle Wiseman and Una Healey are decked out in the hen do attire . Hen Night HQ – Britain’s biggest online seller of hen night party packs – says there has been 32% fall in girls going abroad for their celebrations. In contrast, bookings in the UK are up by 5.2% despite there being a 10% drop here in the number of marriages in the last decade. Fewer couples can afford the expense of a big wedding – which now costs an average of £20,248. Those that are tying the knot are cutting costs with simpler hen nights in less glamourous locations. Hen Night HQ, which supplies 30,000 hen nights a year, has seen a sharp rise in bookings in Reading (74%), Norwich (49%) and Lincoln (58%). Many women are saving money even further by staying at home for their hen nights – reflected in a big rise in the sales of partyware and decorations. L-plates are one of the top sellers according to Hen Party HQ who supplied the gear to Rochelle and Una . The typical number of girls on a hen night is 10 and the most popular theme is Cowgirls, with hot pink glittery cowboy hats the most popular accessory. Brighton . Blackpool . Birmingham .

Hen Night HQ has supplied lots of celebrities with hen night gear including Una Healey and Rochelle Wiseman from the Saturdays. They ordered popular items such as mini tiaras, drivers’ L-plate and even willy drinking straws for their parties in May. The two pop stars typified the trend for simpler hen nights by having a one-night joint celebration with close friends in London. Matt Curry from Hen Night HQ said: 'The nature of hen nights is changing as we all feel the pinch. 'Brides are staying in the UK rather than expecting their friends to pay for expensive weekends away overseas. 'And they are having slightly less ambitious hen celebrations. 'Some are choosing to stay at home and decking out their living rooms. 'Lots more girls are taking over an area of a bar or club. We have seen a big rise in demand for ""Hen Party in Progress"" table boppers, which suggests that rather than going on big pub crawls as was popular a few years ago, hen parties are happier staying in one place.' Hen Night HQ’s five most popular products are . Ladies Night Pink Sash . Rainbow Willy Straws . Willy Whistles . L Plate Confetti . Champagne Blowable Bubbles Bottle . Another new hen night trend is for ‘gifts for the bride’ – the British version of the American bridal shower – with most girls favouring very rude gifts. The top 5 are: . Willy-shaped Lipstick .

Murder convict John Massey, who escaped from Pentonville Prison on Wednesday, was arrested today in Faversham, Kent . A convicted murderer who was on the run for 48 hours has been arrested. John Massey, 64, accomplished his most . dramatic break-out two days ago using a makeshift rope to scale the walls of the . Victorian-built jail Pentonville prison in north London on Wednesday evening. But after two days in hiding, Scotland Yard said Massey was arrested in Faversham, Kent, at about 5.15pm this evening. A Scotland Yard spokesman said: 'John Massey has this afternoon, Friday June 29, been arrested by detectives from the Metropolitan Police Service specialist crime and operations command. 'He has been taken into custody at a north London police station.' Massey was found following an intelligence-led operation, the spokesman said. A second male was arrested on suspicion of aiding and abetting an absconder and was also taken into police custody. The Prison Service is investigating how Massey managed to elude staff. Both of Massey’s previous escapes were . to see ailing family members and this time he acted after his ailing . 86-year-old mother appealed to see him. Friends of his family said he had . learned only a few days ago that his mother May, who has Alzheimer’s . disease, had been calling out his name at a care home in Kent. A friend of his mother . said: ‘May is getting very old now, she is in her eighties, and she has a . touch of Alzheimer’s. She has been crying lately and asking for John.’ Lifer: Massey (above) was jailed in 1976 for murdering a bouncer outside an Essex club after a drunken row . Daring: Massey climbed over a wall at Pentonville Prison using a makeshift rope . Pentonville Prison has held some notorious inmates down the years. The jail houses Category B and C prisoners - and not the most serious Category A cases. Oscar Wilde spent time inside Pentonville before being transferred to Wandsworth in the late 19th century. More recently, Pete Doherty (below) spent six weeks inside for possessing cocaine last year, while Boy George and George Michael have also been held there. In 2008, Blake Fielder-Civil, Amy Winehouse's then husband, was jailed at Pentonville for causing grievous bodily harm. The prison, in Islington, north London, holds up to 1,250 inmates and has been used since 1842. Convicted arsonist Julien Chautard escaped from Pentonville by clinging to the underside of the security van he arrived in three years ago. Massey was sentenced to life in 1976 . for shooting bouncer Charlie Higgins, 36, with a sawn-off shotgun after . being thrown out of an East London pub for fighting. He was also . convicted of attempting to shoot a policeman dead after being chased in . his Aston Martin getaway car. An Old Bailey judge jailed the . carpenter for a minimum of 20 years but he has become one of the . country’s longest serving prisoners because of his repeated escapes. The escape on Wednesday is a huge . embarrassment for the authorities, not least because it is the third . time Massey has slipped from their grasp. Massey is suspected of hiding in the . roof of the gym building as other inmates returned to their cells on . Wednesday afternoon. He then used a makeshift rope – . believed to have been strung together out of sheets – and a pair of . heavy duty gloves to scale the high  prison wall. Guards monitoring CCTV cameras saw the . rope and raced to the perimeter wall at about 6.30pm but were too late. They suspect he was assisted by someone outside. A source said: ‘The guy went to the gym and then hid in the roof and just waited and then escaped from there.’ Prison staff have been banned from . speaking about the escape, but one added: ‘He’s done this before, he’ll . be back.’ Massey’s first escape was in 1994 during a home visit when he . calmly walked out of a social club while his guards played pool and . drank. He fled to the Costa Del Sol and spent three years on the run before being caught and returned to Britain. In 2007 he was released on parole but . was told he must live in South London and could not stay with his . family. But he broke the conditions by travelling to stay with his . father, Jack, 82, who was dying at the Royal Free Hospital, in North . London. Afterwards, Massey said: ‘My dad had . travelled the length and breadth of this country a thousand times in 30 . years in order to visit me in various god-forsaken and dingy prisons. ‘I could not fail him or my mother. To do so would have buckled my shoulders with guilt of unspeakable things to come.’ Two years ago he absconded from Ford . open prison in West Sussex after being refused permission to visit his . terminally ill sister Carol, who was in the same hospital where his . father died. She died two weeks later but rather than hand himself in Massey went to live with his mother and was not caught for ten months. Last night, the sister of Massey’s victim said she was disgusted at his escape. Mother-of-three Carol Spooner, 64, of . Braintree, Essex, said: ‘I was stunned to hear it was the third time he . had escaped. It is disgraceful. ‘As far as I am concerned, a life . sentence should mean just that. 'He should die behind bars. ‘I was very . close to my brother and went to each day at court during the trial. I . can still remember the jeers of his family, saying “At least ours is . still alive”.’ A Prison Service spokesman said: 'This continues to be the subject of a thorough ongoing investigation and Mr Massey will be returned to prison custody as soon as possible. 'We always press for the heaviest penalties for those who escape or attempt to escape.' Pentonville houses up to 1,250 category B male prisoners, rather than . the most serious category A offenders. Police last night carried out door-to-door enquiries in an attempt to find out where he had gone. Pentonville was described by prison inspectors as one of Britain's most . challenging jails to run last year, but the inspection also found 'no . obvious problems with physical security'. In 2009 a convicted arsonist escaped from Pentonville by clinging to the underside of a security van. Julien . Chautard was sentenced to seven years in jail at Snaresbrook Crown . Court in February 2009, but spent just minutes inside Pentonville before . slipping out underneath the van he had arrived in.

The Obama administration had a backup plan if the Osama bin Laden raid had failed and had drafted a ‘highly lawyered’ memo to protect President Obama from potential backlash, according to an official. Former Attorney General Michael Mukasey told Fox News’ Sean Hannity today that Secretary of Defence Leon Panetta drafted a note that would have put the blame instead on Navy Admiral William McRaven. At the time of the raid last May, Adm. McRavin was commander of Joint Special Operations Command. Scroll down for video . Placing blame: Former Attorney General Michael Mukasey, left, told Fox News' Sean Hannity, right, that now-Defence Secretary Leon Panetta drafted a note that would have put the blame on Navy Admiral William McRaven had the raid on Osama bin Laden failed . Talking points: Mr Mukasey also contrasted Obama with how Lincoln responded after Gen. Lee conceded . According to Mr Mukasey, the ‘highly lawyered’ memo from Mr Panetta ‘was to proceed according to the risks, only according to the risks that had been outlined to the president.’ Mukasey said the plan was to blame Admiral William McRaven if the raid failed . He told Hannity: ‘You better believe if anything else had been encountered and the mission had failed, then the blame would have fell on McRaven. That’s what this is about.’ President Obama sat anxiously in the Situation Room the night of the raid, flanked by Vice President Joe Biden, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, and other high-ranking officials as they watched the events unfold. SEAL Team 6, a group of two dozen elite Marines, were able to bring down the terrorist leader in his stronghold in Abbottabad, Pakistan. In today’s interview, Hannity prompted Mr Mukasey that the memo was ‘designed to protect the president politically.’ Mr Mukasey responded: ‘I think there is going to be more that come tumbling out about that escapade. But so far, that memo is enough.’ In the interview, the former attorney general put Mr Obama’s leadership in context to presidents of the past, including Abraham Lincoln and Dwight D. Eisenhower. Speaking first about Lincoln, Mr Mukasey referenced the speech he delivered after Gen. Lee surrendered, ending the Civil War. Night to remember: President Obama, centre left, Vice President Joe Biden, left, and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, centre right, looked on at the May 1, 2011 raid . ‘Lincoln delivered what turned out to . (be) his last speech from the window of the White House. He rejected . taking any credit for it. Put it on General (Ulysses S.) Grant and the . troops and then talked mostly about the problems of reconstruction.’ 'You better believe if anything else had . been encountered and the mission had failed, then the blame would have . fell on McRaven. That's what this is about.' -Former Attorney General Michael Mukasey . Several US Navy SEALs spoke out to MailOnline approaching the one-year anniversary of bin Laden’s death, saying that it was a group effort and that Mr Obama is using the killing to springboard his re-election campaign. One currently-serving SEAL said: . ‘Obama wasn’t in the field, at risk,carrying a gun. As president, at . every turn, he should be thanking the guys who put their lives on the . line to do this.’ The SEAL added: ‘He does so in his official speeches because his speechwriters are smart.’ The original note, . which was written by Mr Panetta when he was still serving as Director . of the CIA, said the following: ‘Received phone call from Tom Donilon . who stated that the President made a decision with regard to AC1 . (Abbottabad Compound 1). Drafted: Then CIA-director Leon Panetta wrote in the note: 'The timing, operational decision making and control are in Admiral McRaven¿s hands. The approval is provided on the risk profile presented to the President' Blame game: Former SEALs spoke out in April saying Obama was using bin Laden's death as a rallying point on the campaign trail; he is pictured today at an event in Richmond, Virginia . 'The decision is to proceed with the assault. Killed: Osama bin Laden was killed on the May 1 raid of his compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan . ‘The timing, operational decision making and control are in Admiral McRaven’s hands. 'The approval is provided on the risk profile presented to the President. ‘Any additional risks are to be brought back to the President for his consideration. The direction is to go in and get bin Laden and if he is not there, to get out. Those instructions were conveyed to Admiral McRaven at approximately 10:45am.’ Breitbart columnist Ben Shapiro echoed a similar sentiment, writing: ‘The memo doesn’t show a gutsy call. It doesn’t show a president willing to take the blame for a mission gone wrong. 'It shows a CYA maneuver by the White House…the hero here was McRaven, not Obama. ‘And had the mission gone wrong, McRaven surely would have been thrown under the bus.’ His comments went viral, with more than 160,000 tweets and 25,000 shares on Facebook. Independent magazine Mother Jones responded today with a counterpoint. Writer Kevin Drum called the theory ‘absurd’ and applauded their ‘creative nutbaggery.’ He wrote: ‘The idea of Obama getting credit for killing bin Laden just drives conservatives up a tree. ‘At this point, many of them are, apparently, literally willing to believe anything that suggests otherwise.’ Watch video here: .

Weight-loss programmes can really help obese youngsters shed the pounds – but only if started early enough, new research suggests. Overweight children under 10 had much slower weight gain than teenagers who received similar interventions such as a change in diet and exercise habits, say scientists from the Karolinska Institutet in Stockholm. ‘The results are indeed alarming for severely obese adolescents, who run a serious risk of disease,’ said Claude Marcus, professor of paediatrics at the Institutet. Excessive pounds in childhood often stay on into adulthood, where they have been linked to heart disease, diabetes and other health problems . ‘New treatment methods must be developed and for some young people, surgery must even be considered an option.’ Excessive pounds in childhood often stay on into adulthood, where they have been linked to heart disease, diabetes and other health problems. The Swedish report was published alongside Dutch research in the journal the Archives of Paediatrics & Adolescent Medicine. The Dutch scientists found that heavy three- to five-year-olds saw continued benefits from a weight-loss intervention at least several months after it ended. Excessive pounds in childhood often stay on into adulthood, where they have been linked to heart disease, diabetes and other health problems . Commenting in the journal on both studies, Dr Elsie Taveras, a paediatrician at Harvard Medical School and Boston Children's Hospital, said: ‘What [these studies] are showing is a pretty consistent trend that if we intervene early, we could really have an effect on changing the trajectory of weight gain in children. She added there is mounting evidence that paying attention to young children may be a promising way to stem the global obesity epidemic. In 2008, more than a third of U.S. children were either overweight or obese, according to official figures. The numbers have also been on the rise in Europe, although they are still lower than in the U.S. The Dutch researchers, led by Dr Gianni Bocca of Beatrix Children's Hospital in Groningen, studied 75 heavy children who had been randomly assigned to get either usual care or an intensive weight-loss program. The program lasted four months and involved 25 sessions with dietary advice, exercise and, for the parents only, behavioural counselling. A year after the study began, children in the weight intervention group had lost one unit of their body mass index, while the others saw no change. ‘The magnitude of the effect, especially initially after the intervention, wasn't very large, but what needs to be taken into account was that these children were growing,’ Dr Taveras told Reuters Health. ‘What these interventions are showing is that you can have an effect, and hopefully these interventions are changing the trajectory the children were headed towards.’","Children under 10 had much slower weight gain than teenagers on diet and exercise regimens .

Nigel French, 51, has been found guilty of attempted voyeurism after he drilled peep holes in the floor to watch the girls as they showered after a swimming lesson. The married father-of-two was caught out when a PE teacher spotted his feet and saw him on all fours in a storage room above the changing room. The teacher found a hole over the showers - with a ceiling tile moved to allow a better view. Eight more holes were discovered over the boys changing room at Pen y Dre High School in Merthyr Tydfil, South Wales - which had previously been used by girls. Prosecutor Suzanne Thomas said: 'It was likely the holes above the boys changing room were done some years ago.' French, a former Scout leader and devout churchgoer, claimed he was looking for bats, even though there was no evidence of bats nesting in the school. The caretaker, who had worked at the school for 21 years, told police he was waiting for a swimming lesson to finish before cleaning the pool. He said: “Basically my only offence could be skiving. “I went up to the viewing gallery and I laid down facing forward, looking at the side of the pool, waiting for the lesson to finish. “I wasn’t spying on pupils in the pool because that would be wrong that would.” The court heard that French, who had around-the-clock access to the school and swimming pool, was often seen hanging around the pool's viewing gallery. The married father-of-two had worked at Pen y Dre High School (pictured) for 21 years . Colleague John Davies told Merthyr Tydfil Crown Court how he found French among a stack of gym mats. He said: 'I saw part of his feet sticking out towards the back end and I wondered what was going on. 'I could see somebody was in a semi prone position. He pushed his head above the mats and then quickly ducked back down.' French, of Penydarren, Merthyr Tydfil, South Wales, was found guilty of attempted voyeurism and will be sentenced next month.","Nigel French, 51, claimed he was looking for bats .

Pictured in 2006, modelling with another woman for animal rights group Peta, Patrick Ribbsaeter holds a sign promoting the organisation's campaign to encourage the closure of all zoos. The photograph was taken at a studio in Bangkok, where he posed with fellow model Avi Sewa, and was used in an advertising campaign which ran throughout the Philippines, India, Sweden and Thailand. Posing: Patrick Ribbsaeter and Avi Siwa hold a banner encouraging the closure of all zoos for the Ethical Treatment of Animals at a studio in Bangkok in 2006 . Ribbsaeter is on trial this week accused of beating up his Thai girlfriend after he allegedly found her with another man at a champagne-fuelled swingers party. He is accused of punching Wachiraporn Sara-Pod so many times on their drive . home that she could barely see out of her swollen face, the Old Bailey . was told. She eventually fled his alleged assault wearing nothing but a fur coat, the court heard. The couple had earlier gone to the ‘Killing Kittens’ sex party at a restaurant in Leicester Square, London. Tickets for the event in October cost £150 a person, and complimentary champagne flowed freely. Within a few hours of the party beginning, the court was told, couples were openly having sex. But . instead of being happy to share his lover with others, Ribbsaeter . allegedly flew into a jealous rage when he caught her in the toilet with . a fellow party-goer. 'Suffocated': Patrick Ribbsaeter, left, is . accused of hitting Wachiraporn Sara-Pod, right, repeatedly in the face, . smashing her head against the dashboard and throttling her . Miss Sara-Pod, 29, insisted she was only taking drugs with a male friend when her 32-year-old boyfriend burst in. ‘I was feeling tipsy. I remember I took two lines of cocaine,’ she said. ‘Patrick came in and said I had slept with a guy in the toilet. He was really angry. He grabbed me and took me out.’ Ribbsaeter then left her and went to another West End nightspot, the British Luxury Club. She . followed him there, but he refused to talk to her, she said, and he . left with his friend Dheeraj Harjani, a company director. Finally . at 6.30am he agreed to meet her by her Land Rover Discovery in a car . park. When she arrived he struck her across the face, knocking her to . the ground, the jury was told – and struck her again while she was . sitting on the floor. Patrick Ribbsaeter, 32, is accused of beating his girlfriend repeatedly, forcing her to flee her car wearing just a fur coat . A . passer-by saw the alleged attack and asked: ‘Why are you hitting the . girl?’ before punching Ribbsaeter in the face, the court heard, in turn . knocking him to the ground. But . the Miss Sara-Pod then intervened to protect Ribbsaeter, saying: . ‘Please don’t hurt him, he’s my boyfriend,’ jurors were told. Ribbsaeter . then drove her towards his home in Streatham, south London, while . constantly asking if she had sex with the man in the toilet, it was . claimed. Miss Sara-Pod said: . ‘Patrick hit me again and again. He was asking me “Did you have sex . with that guy?” I say no and when I say no he hit me. ‘He tell me I’m lying. He said he will hit me until I say the truth. ‘Then . he grabbed my hair and hit my head on the console. He kept hitting me . so many times that I tried to open the car to jump out.’ Ribbsaeter eventually stopped the car on their way home, and asked her if she wanted to have sex on the back seat, she claimed. ‘I . said yes because I believed it would calm him down,’ said Miss . Sara-Pod. But after the sex he punched her in the face and put his hands . around her throat, she claimed. ‘He had his whole body on top of me and kept punching on my face many times,’ she went on. ‘I was bleeding. ‘He had his hand round my neck and squeezed it until I felt suffocated.’ The court heard that the assault only stopped when Ribbsaeter noticed she was losing consciousness. For your eyes only: Killing Kittens parties are famous for allowing attendees to explore their sexuality in a liberal environment . Prosecutor Camilla De Silva told the jury: ‘It ended when she managed to escape from the car wearing nothing but a fur coat. ‘She ran to a garage and a mechanic called 999 at 10.14am.’ Ribbsaeter’s . friend Mr Harjani told the court he had joined him on his search for . Miss Sara-Pod at the sex party – and looked on as the accused man pushed . open a lavatory cubicle. Mr . Harjani said: ‘She was there kind of slumped on the toilet seat and the . floor – and there was another guy there having sex with her or . something. He was half naked.’ Mr . Harjani said Ribbsaeter later told him the man had tried to rape her, . and added: ‘Patrick said to me it was OK for her to have sex with . another guy if she had her senses, because that’s the fun of the party, . however,  not if she was being taken advantage of.’ Ribbsaeter denies causing grievous bodily harm.

Many BBC staff have never made a secret of their disdain for their new northern base. But one presenter has taken the sniping to a new level...by making an on-air joke accusing the Corporation’s neighbours in Salford of being light-fingered. The gaffe came when BBC Five Live breakfast show host Rachel Burden was interviewing Olympic cycling hopeful Laura Trott, who won two gold medals at the Track Cycling World Championships in Melbourne, about her success. But when Miss Trott, 19, joked about accidentally leaving the medals in her car, Miss Burden quipped: ‘What? Around here?’ The suggestion that the car was at risk of being broken into caused fury among radio listeners in Salford, who help to pay 35-year-old Miss Burden’s wages through the licence fee and say the city is being unfairly reviled as a crime hotspot by BBC staff. Edward Reid, a legal worker, said of Tuesday’s interview: ‘It’s time presenters like Rachel kept their prejudices to themselves rather than airing them to listeners. She is employed to do a job, not pass snide remarks about an area which she knows little or next to nothing about. Grow up.’ Joanna Smith, 29, a clerical worker, said: ‘It’s just ignorance really. Salford does have a reputation as a hard city but so has London – they need to get a grip.’ Salford MP Hazel Blears said of Salford Quays, where the BBC is based: ‘I go down there on a regular basis and there’s always a lot of activity. It seems like a safe place to be. In any urban environment you get the odd incident.’ This week it emerged that BBC managers have offered staff in Salford personal security guards to escort them to their cars and tram stops from their studios. However, crime rates for Shepherd’s Bush, home to the BBC’s White City London headquarters, are higher than in Salford, and its figures for violent crime and robbery are way above the national average. Furthermore, recent figures show that although Salford remains slightly above the national average for violence and robbery, crime there has dropped. The BBC’s move to Media City in Salford Quays – where about 1,600 staff are now based, has been riddled with gaffes and controversy, with many presenters refusing to move. BBC Breakfast presenters Sian Williams and Chris Hollins both refused to make the change and have since been replaced. Left behind: Laura Trott, centre, with her gold medal following at the Track Cycling World Championships in Melbourne, Australia . Top Gear presenter Jeremy Clarkson blasted the BBC’s move last year, describing Salford as ‘a small suburb with a Starbucks and a canal with ducks on it’ and said that he would resign if the motoring programme was moved north. Miss Burden, a mother-of-three, last year said she was ‘excited’ by the prospect of a move to the North and a new base in Salford. But she revealed she and her partner would not be selling their four-bedroom London home in Ealing, valued at £650,000. ‘London prices are likely to rise faster than other parts of the country so we want to hold on to it and let it out,’ she said. Double winner: Laura Trott with her Gold Medal after winning the Women's Omnium during day four of the 2012 UCI Track Cycling World Championships in Melbourne, Australia . She added that she was looking forward to settling in an upmarket Cheshire village with good schools and an easy commute to Salford. She said: ‘I was surprised prices in Cheshire aren’t much cheaper for a similar-sized house to our home, although the gardens are larger. It may not be easy to find a home that ticks every box so we are likely to rent first.’ A spokesman for BBC North said: 'During a light-hearted moment at the end of the interview with Laura Trott, an off-the-cuff remark was made. No offence was intended and we’re sorry if anyone was upset.' Burden's remarks follow reports that a number of staff have been warned over their safety following the move to Salford. Corporation chiefs have offered personal security guards to escort men and women to their cars and tram stops from the studios. And an extraordinary email intended to reassure staff about on-site security will serve only to increase fears, with a BBC executive admitting she has been looking at site security ‘following a couple of incidents’. In a move costing an estimated . £1.5billion, the BBC has relocated 2,500 staff across five departments . including Sport, Children’s and Radio 5 Live to the Media City site. BBC Breakfast made its Salford debut . on Tuesday, while Blue Peter and Match of the Day are among the . programmes which air from the futuristic complex. Fears: The BBC's £200m Media City development in Salford. Staff were told that it was a 'different kettle of fish' from West London . Incidents there over the past year include: . The offer of personal security applies . particularly for those working late at night or early in the morning. In a leaked email intended to reassure staff about on-site safety, Rhian . Roberts, head of development for Radio 5 Live and Sports Extra, said . the measures had been tightened after incidents affecting staff. ‘I’ve been looking at on-site security . on 5 Live’s behalf following a couple of incidents – and also the . reality that Media City is a different kettle of fish to W12.’ The BBC’s buildings at White City have . private car parks manned by security and which require a pass to enter, . while the Tube station is yards away. Concerned: Rhian Roberts, left, head of development for BBC Radio 5 live and Sports Extra, said Salford was a 'different kettle of fish' to west London and there has been an offer of personal security for those working late . By contrast, the Salford Quays area . has open access as a number of businesses operate in the area and is . relatively deserted after normal working hours. The site is patrolled by . security guards on foot and on Segway electric two-wheeled vehicles. In the same email, Tony Chebrika, the . head of security for Peel Media Group – which owns and polices the site – . said he could ‘arrange for escorts’ for frightened staff. Mr Chebrika . also reassured staff that the site had 300 CCTV cameras, guards on . constant patrol and a 24-hour control room. In spite of these precautions, . however, a wide range of crimes were reported by BBC employees since . last year including assault, spray-paint damage and thefts. Paul Newman, head of communications . for Peel Media, said that the Salford complex includes more than 50 . commercial businesses – including Costa Coffee, Wagamama and Prezzo – . and 378 apartments. He said: ‘From day one our policy has . been to, on request, offer escorts to people who want to get to their . cars or the tram stop, particularly late at night.’ The crime rate has dropped in Salford . in recent years but remains slightly above the national average for . violent crime and robbery. Upping sticks: Bill Turnbull and Susanna Reid present BBC Breakfast, just one of the programmes that has been forced to relocate to the north . Leafy: BBC Television Centre in White City, west London, where staff had previously been based before the move to Salford . Last year a student staying at a hotel in . Salford Quays was shot dead in what police described as an ‘unprovoked . attack’. However, crime rates for the Shepherd’s Bush area around White . City are higher than Salford and its figures for violent crime and . robbery are well above the national average. John Merry, leader of Salford City Council, yesterday pointed out that crime was not unique to the city. ‘This is just scaremongering,’ he . said. ‘It is not unusual for complexes like MediaCityUK to have high . levels of security, whether in Salford, London or any other city.’ BBC Breakfast presenters Susanna Reid . and Bill Turnbull were teased yesterday over their move to Salford. Shaun Ryder, of the Happy Mondays, said: ‘I only live four minutes away . ... great to have you on in the North.’ When Ryder started asking Turnbull . where exactly in Cheshire he would be living, the presenter replied: . ‘Careful’, acknowledging that the travel and residential arrangements of .

Five men who preyed on 'vulnerable' teenage girls for sex have today been found guilty of paying for the sexual services of a child. A jury at Derby Crown Court heard how Anthony Lambert, 51, Stefan Godfrey, 44, John Shaw, 54, Ijaz Ahmed, 35, and Mark Adaoui, 40, picked the girls up from care homes and streets in Derby and paid them up to £30 to perform sex acts. The men gave the girls, who were aged between 13 and 15, alcohol, drugs and cuddly toys to encourage them to have sex with them. Guilty: Mark Adaoui, left, and Anthony Lambert, right, are two of five men found guilty of paying for sexual services of a child . The convictions come after a lengthy and complex investigation by Derbyshire Police, which started in July 2010, when officers became concerned for the safety of teenage girls who were seen on Derby's streets. The force worked with Derby City Council after they discovered some of the 15 girls involved were in care. Seven girls were involved in the prosecution of the men, five of whom were victims and two others who were witnesses to what happened. The girls knew each other but there was no connection between the men, the investigation found. During the five-week trial, the jury heard one of the defendants, Anthony Lambert, 51, had picked up one of the victims at her care home with another girl and drove them back to his house. They had sex on his bed while the other girl sat on the floor playing with her mobile phone. On a separate occasion, the pair drank vodka and smoked cannabis before having sex at his house. On both occasions, Lambert paid the girl £30, the jury heard. Following today's convictions, Detective Superintendent Andy Stokes, head of Public Protection at Derbyshire Police, said: 'These convictions would not have been possible had the victims involved not been brave enough to come forward and speak to police and later give evidence in court. In court: John Shaw, left, and Stafan . Godfrey, right, appeared alongside three other men accused of paying . girls for sexual services . 'They were very vulnerable girls, some of whom came from unstable or difficult backgrounds. They were easy prey for these men, who made them feel important and safe, buying them presents to keep them on side. 'The girls at times felt flattered by the attention and were grateful for the gifts. But they gradually realised that what they were involved in was wrong, they were putting themselves at risk and the men were exploiting them.' He added: 'We have a dedicated team of officers who work with other agencies, such as social care, to safeguard children and investigate cases of abuse and exploitation. 'It is important that people realise that men who abuse children come from all walks of life, backgrounds and cultures. 'Nationally, police forces and other organisations are becoming more aware of child exploitation, gaining a better understanding of victims and how offenders operate. 'More recently, the Deputy Children's Commissioner has warned that a disproportionate number of girls living in care homes are becoming victims of exploitation. The men were found guilty of paying for sexual services of a child at Derby Crown Court, pictured . 'Since 2008, we have continued to build a close relationship with all authorities in Derbyshire that are involved in the welfare of young people so we can work together to better protect children. This includes close liaison with the Derby-based charity Safe and Sound.' At Derby Crown Court today, Ijaz Ahmed, 35, from Derby; Lambert, from Derby; and Stefan Godfrey, 44, from Pinxton were all found guilty of paying for the sexual services of a child. The jury also found John Shaw, 55, of Kniveton, guilty of the same charge but cleared him of a separate charge of assault. Mark Adaoui, 40, from Derby, was also convicted of paying for the sexual services of a child and a separate count of supplying cannabis. Five other men, who were part of the same investigation, have already admitted sexual offences involving children at earlier hearings. A 51-year-old man was jailed for seven years last January for paying for the sexual services of a child and possessing indecent images of children, while a 55-year-old man was given a three-year community order in August after he admitted to three counts of paying for the sexual services of a child, police said. The remaining three men are due to be sentenced at a later date: Ian Yeoman, 60, from Derby, who admitted 13 counts including paying for the sexual services of a child, sexual activity with a child and possessing indecent images; Colin Simpson, 55, from Creswell, who pleaded guilty to sexual activity with a child; and 56-year-old David Shardlow, from Derby, who admitted to nine counts of paying for the sexual services of a child and possessing indecent images. Child welfare charity Safe and Sound Derby has praised the bravery of the young victims of the five convicted men. The charity, which helps children and young people who are being, or who are at risk of being sexually exploited, worked closely with local agencies throughout the police investigation and operation, which began in July 2010. Chief executive Nathalie Walters praised the victims for their bravery and said she hoped the case would prevent others from committing similar crimes. 'We have been providing support to two of the victims as well as to the parents of one of the victims, helping them to move forward in their lives,' she said. 'The girls have had to wait for two years for this case to come to court where they then had to relive their horrific ordeal all over again. 'Giving evidence in court and being questioned in front of the perpetrators has been a harrowing experience for them. 'They have showed amazing bravery and strength of character and without their testimonies these men would not have been convicted. 'This case demonstrates that child sexual exploitation can come in many forms from on-street to internet grooming and that offenders can come from all walks of life. 'We hope these verdicts show that child sexual exploitation will not be tolerated in any form.' The charity Family Lives, which provides help and support to families, said: 'The jury's verdict in the trial of these five disturbed individuals, who preyed on ""vulnerable"" teenage girls for sex, sends a clear and unequivocal message that this will not be tolerated. 'Parents and guardians have a duty to educate both themselves and their children about the dangers of who their children associate with when outside the school and home environment. 'Even within the home, parents and families need to be aware of the risks of new streams of social media and pressure to participate in sexting - the sending of inappropriate images. 'Family Lives encourages all parents and carers to have conversations with their children about the consequences of associating with adults - male or female - who offer alcohol and narcotics freely to their children. 'No one can know where their child is 24/7, but parents can equip themselves with support and information on how to talk to their kids about the consequences of engaging in risky behaviour.'

Former Prime Minister Tony Blair has admitted that at least some of the country's current economic woes are down to him. The ex-Labour leader said today his Government had not fully understood the impact economic integration could have on the British economy. But, in an apparent warning to current party leader Ed Miliband, who wants Britain’s banks dramatically reined in, he insisted that a 'vibrant' financial sector was important for the UK. Acceptance: Former Prime Minister Tony Blair admitted on Sky News, pictured, that some of the country's current economic woes are down to him . Speaking on Sky News he said: 'In respect of the economy, yes, of course, everybody who was in power in the period bears a certain responsibility.' He qualified the remark, however, arguing that the inter-depency of the world economy, which had developed over the last three decades, was also a major factor in causing the financial crisis. He added: 'You have got this deep integration of the global economy and where you have a lot of financial instruments that were created whose impact people didn’t properly understand.' Asked if that meant Labour did not fully understand it while he was in power, he replied: 'No, we didn’t.' He added: 'A vibrant financial sector is also a very important part of our future. 'Take the necessary steps, but realise that a thriving and healthy banking sector is a major part of the modern British economy and will also be so.' Praise: Tony Blair said he thought those who are leading the Labour Party are 'desperate to do their best for the country' - pictured here with current leader Ed Miliband . Mr Blair who has served as a Middle . East envoy for the 'Quartet' - made up of the United Nations, United . States, European Union and Russia - since leaving office, is keen to . return to domestic politics. He said: 'I feel I have got something to contribute to the debates that are going on in the country and I want to do that. 'We have got an extraordinary and uncertain and unpredictable situation today. I think we are living through an era of almost uniquely low predictability, economically and politically. 'We have got the eurozone crisis, which is one big issue. We have got what’s happening in the Middle East, which is another. You know, I have got things to say and if people want to listen, that’s great, and if they don’t, fine.' Mr Blair said when Labour lost power, it traditionally lost power for a long time. 'I think it is possible in these circumstances to re-write that traditional script,' he added. Tony Blair suggested Cherie had played a crucial role in helping to secure the London Olympics . 'I know those people who are leading the Labour Party at the moment are desperate to do their best for the country.' Responding to Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg’s suggestion that he was open to working with Labour after the next election, Mr Blair said he was 'sceptical' about coalition. Mr Blair also suggested his wife Cherie had played a crucial role in helping to secure the Olympics for the UK. 'It’s the strangest electorate I ever had to deal with. It’s about 120 people. 'Strangely, my wife played a very big part in this really because of the 120, some were the great and the good, members of royal families like our own Princess Anne and people who are very well known, and then you have the others that for various reasons worked in sports administration in their countries and they were also on the committee. 'People tended to make a big fuss of all the big names but everyone had the same vote and my wife was very, very good at going to different countries and seeing people before the Games who were the less significant, if you like, people. 'By the time we got to Singapore we knew those people, I then met them and was talking to them, all of these things helped, I think.' A spokesman for Tony Blair's office said: 'The Blairs will support their children in whatever they decide to do, but the idea that either of them is interested in a dynasty is pure invention.'","PM said his Government did not fully understand the impact of economic integration .

Taylor, nicknamed The Power, has been on a strict diet to improve his game and was in no mood to endure the jibes from hecklers. His early exit stunned fans of the sport, which has long been lampooned for the portly appearance of some of its competitors. Taylor, 51, who has lost two-and-a-half stones in three months, was playing long-time rival Raymond van Barneveld at the SRT/Simpson & Ward Shetland Masters in Lerwick when we walked off. He said afterwards that he had been upset by abuse from spectators. 'I want fans to come to the events and to enjoy themselves,' he told the Daily Telegraph, 'and it's fine for them to support a particular player, but it goes too far when the abuse is personal. Rivalry: Taylor (left) walked out during a semi-final match against Raymond van Barneveld (right) 'I was upset by some of the comments being aimed in my direction, which was why I left the stage, and I apologise to the majority of fans that I wasn't able to finish the game.'

However, just seconds after the excited child and her mum had left the store, the bear was taken. Mum Correen, 25, said: 'I’d stopped to look in a shop window and Tilly had put the bear in the pushchair. 'The next thing I knew, she was looking round for it and saying she couldn’t find it. 'I didn’t see anyone take it. They must have done it really quickly because one minute it was there and the next it was gone.' After searching for the teddy without success, Correen took her distraught daughter home and called the police. Correen said: 'She was devastated, she kept saying ‘a naughty man has taken my bear’ and she was crying all night. 'I don’t know how anyone could steal a teddy from a four-year-old girl - some people must have no morals at all.' Tilly said: 'I was sad when the naughty man took it. It made me cry.' Leicestershire . Police are appealing for anyone with information about the theft, which . happened in Highcross Street, to come forward. Back with the bear: When it heard about Tilly's unfortunate incident the Build-a . a-Bear store in Highcross, Leicester offered little Tilly a replacement . Friend Jody Branston, 49, heard about the theft and contacted the shop on Tilly’s behalf to ask if it could help. She said: 'I just thought how can someone do something so horrible to a little girl? 'They nicked a pink teddy bear right off the buggy and they knew exactly what they were doing. 'It’s not like it could have belonged to anyone other than a small child. 'No child should be that upset, so I called the store and asked if staff could do anything and they said ‘yes’ straight away.' Staff at the shop presented Tilly with a new, identical bear on Thursday. Supervisor Oliver Ellison remembered serving Tilly and her mum on Tuesday. He said: 'You could tell she loved it. I was gutted for her when I found out it had been taken. How can someone do that to a little girl?'","Tilly Donaghey had wanted new bear for weeks .

Nelson Mandela celebrated his 94th birthday with the whole nation today as millions of South Africans showed their love for the iconic hero of the struggle against apartheid. Children from across country kicked off celebrations for the country's first black president this morning with resounding choruses of Happy Birthday. Mandela spent the day enjoy a private party with his wife Graca Macel and other members of his family at their homestead in his southeastern birth village of Qunu. Party time: Nelson Mandela celebrated his 94th birthday today with the whole nation today as millions of South Africans showed their love for the iconic hero of the struggle against apartheid . Meanwhile, in a fitting tribute to the man who has dedicated his life to trying to improve the lot of others, communities in South Africa and around the world dedicated 67 minutes of the day to volunteer work and projects for the needy. The time period was one minute for each of Mandela's 67 years in public service. Mandela became South Africa's first black president in 1994 after spending 27 years in prison for his fight against racist apartheid rule, and was awarded a Nobel Peace Prize for his efforts. Tributes to Mandela also poured in from around the globe, with U.S. President Barack Obama saying Mandela 'has changed the arc of history, transforming his country, the continent and the world.' Ahmed Kathrada, one of Mandela's oldest friends, said Madiba, as he is affectionately known by his Xhosa clan name, championed the dignity of all. `'You can be rich but if you don't . have dignity you are a second-class citizen,' Kathrada said in a public . lecture marking the birthday celebrations. Tokyo . Sexwale, a longtime ally in the governing African Nation Congress, . described Mandela as a global statesman who inspired the world. At . one Johannesburg elementary school, children watched a film documenting . Mandela's life and his years of service and sacrifice along with a . photographic display of him meeting celebrities including Beyonce, . Michael Jackson and Cristiano Ronaldo.

Mandela set an example to show us that reconciliation is possible,' said 10-year-old Thakgalo Ditabe. She said she wanted Mandela to know . how much he meant to her. Ntando Ntuli, 12, said with pride: 'He is my hero because he fought for us. He is an icon, the king of Africa.' In . 2009, the United Nations established Nelson Mandela International Day . to honour the African leader on his birthday through acts of community . service. In many districts, . South Africa came to a virtual standstill early this morning as . strangers greeted each other in the streets and even infants at one . pre-school waved at passersby and sang: 'We love you, Tata,' or `'great . father,' a supreme term of endearment. In the eastern port city of Durban Sir . Alex Ferguson, manager of England's Manchester United football team . that is widely followed in Africa, sang Happy Birthday over a cake iced . with the image of the team's yellow and red badge. Ferguson, who met Mandela on previous visits, said 'his presence and personality exudes all around.' Manchester United plays the first game of its South African tour tonight. South African churchmen and politicians urged people across the country 'to make every day a Mandela Day.' Former U.S. President Bill Clinton got the celebrations off to an early start yesterday. He and daughter Chelsea met with Mandela in Qunu. Thirsty work: Mandela sips a cup of tea during the party as his wife Graca Machel looks on admiringly .

Photographs tweeted by one of Mandela's grandsons showed the Nobel Peace Prize winner comfortably seated in an armchair with a blanket over his knees and with the Clintons and his wife, Graca Machel, at his side. Nobel laureate Archbishop Emeritus Desmond Tutu said the greatest gift the nation could give Mandela on Wednesday would be 'to emulate his magnanimity and grace.' 'Mr. Mandela taught us to love ourselves, to love one another and to love our country,' Tutu said. Mandela's activism helped bring democracy and freedom to the once white-ruled South Africa. But the country remains beset by tensions over continued white minority domination of the economy, massive unemployment, poor education and health services and the millions who remain homeless or in shacks.","Iconic leader celebrates 94th birthday at homestead in the eastern cape .

Downturn: Business leaders and economists last night called for interest rates to be slashed to zero - amid warnings that Britain could face an unprecedented 'triple-dip' recession. This has piled further pressure on George Osborne, pictured . Business leaders and economists last night called for interest rates to be slashed to zero – amid warnings that Britain could face an unprecedented ‘triple-dip’ recession. The British Chambers of Commerce (BCC) urged the Bank of England to take immediate action to slash the cost of borrowing to homeowners and business, following shock growth figures last week showing the economic downturn is accelerating. Economists at the Ernst & Young Item Club also backed the call, saying an interest rate cut was ‘not the only answer, but it would help’. The two organisations are the only forecasters to use the same economic model as the Treasury, meaning their conclusions are based on identical data to that used by Chancellor George Osborne. Their intervention comes amid warnings that Britain could suffer an extraordinary triple-dip recession unless urgent action is taken to boost growth. Official figures last week showed Britain’s economy shrank by 0.7 per cent between April and June. Most analysts believe the Olympics effect will pull Britain out of recession later this year. But, with the eurozone crisis unresolved, there are growing fears of a fresh downturn next year – turning the current double-dip recession into a triple-dip. Azad Zangana, an analyst at Schroders, said Britain would enjoy an economic bounce until next spring, but would then slump back into recession unless action was taken to resolve the eurozone crisis. Michael Saunders, at Citigroup, said the outlook was ‘disastrously bad compared with previous [economic] cycles’. The Bank of England’s monetary policy committee is already under pressure to cut interest rates from their historic low of 0.5 per cent. Some commentators believe a cut to 0.25 per cent could be agreed this week, but others want the Bank to go further and slash rates to zero. Pressure: The British Chambers of Commerce has urged the Bank of England, pictured, to take immediate action to slash the cost of borrowing to homeowners and business . Action on this scale would knock . almost £500 a year off a typical £150,000 tracker mortgage – putting . money directly into the hands of cash-strapped families. It could also . help businesses struggling to pay their debts. But . it would be bad news for savers, pensioners and those approaching . retirement, who are already suffering the effects of years of low . interest rates. David Kern, . chief economist at the BCC, said a rate cut would be more effective in . boosting demand and easing inflation than another round of the . quantitative easing recently favoured by the Bank. ‘A rate cut now could really help business,’ he said. ‘Lower inflation is critical to underpinning real incomes and sustaining demand in the UK economy.’ But former Tory Chancellor Lord Lamont warned that existing low rates were already distorting the markets and having a dramatic effect on pensioners. Mr Osborne received a rare boost at the weekend when the ratings agency Standard and Poor’s confirmed Britain’s coveted Triple-A credit rating, which allows the Government to borrow at rock-bottom rates to service the debts left by Labour. The Chancellor said the verdict showed the Government was on the right track. He added: ‘This is a reminder that despite the economic problems we face, the world has confidence that we are dealing with them.’ But Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls said: ‘The long-term impact on the underlying strength of the British economy will be more young people unemployed and businesses investing in other parts of the world. 'All those things add up to an economy which ends up permanently weaker, not just temporarily weaker.’","The British Chambers of Commerce has .

Found alive: Raymond Roth turned up on a highway in Santee, South Carolina, five days after going missing during a swim off Long Island . After a frantic five-day search for a man who went missing while swimming with his son off Long Island, New York, the 47-year-old father was found alive and well - in South Carolina more than 730 miles away. ‘He's not drowned and dead,’ New York State Park Police Capt. Bruce Marx said at a briefing on Thursday. Raymond Roth, 47, of Massapequa, was reported missing Saturday after his 22-year-old son, Jonathan, told authorities the two had gone to Jones Beach and that his father went swimming but never returned. The report prompted a desperate search and rescue operation involving police marine units, helicopters and officers who scoured the waters for several days, but to no avail. On Wednesday night, Roth’s brother contacted police and reported that he was somewhere in Florida, Marx said. By that time, the search for Roth had turned into a body recovery mission. At around 3:30am Thursday, Roth was stopped by police going 90 mph on a highway in Santee, South Carolina, and issued a speeding ticket. The officer who issued the ticket then . observed that Roth was listed in a national registry of missing . persons; Roth said he was returning to New York and the officer let him . proceed north. Long way home: Police stopped Roth as he sped down a highway in Santee, South Carolina, more than 730 miles from the spot where he went missing . Missing swimmer: Raymond Roth vanished while taking a swim near Field 6 at Jones Beach last Saturday . Pricey adventure: Police estimate that the search and rescue mission that was launched following Roth's disappearance cost tens of thousands of dollars . It is not clear how Roth got to South Carolina or where he was coming from when he was stopped. Last Saturday afternoon, Roth’s son told police he was texting on the beach while his father was taking his daily swim in calm waters in an area not protected by a lifeguard, according to CBS2. Distraught son: Roth's 22-year-old son, Jonathan, was texting on the beach when he noticed that his father was gone . When the 22-year-old looked up from his cell phone, he realized that his dad was nowhere to be found. He reported Roth missing, setting off a massive search and rescue operation involving multiple agencies, including the U.S. Coast Guard. So far, no criminal charges have been filed against the 47-year-old man. Marx estimated that the search effort cost ‘tens of thousands’ of dollars. State park police got Roth's cell phone number from a relative and had several telephone conversations with him on Thursday. Authorities said Roth told them he was heading back to Long Island and could arrive later in the day, although Marx said there was no way to know if that's true. A LinkedIn page for Roth noted he worked for Level 3 Communications, a data networking company. According to real estate records cited by NBC4, Roth's Cape Cod-style four-bedroom house in Massapequa was put up for sale for $549,999 on July 21, a week before he went missing. Jane Stone, who has lived in Roth's neighborhood for more than 50 years, said Roth was always pleasant and would often use his snow blower to clear neighbors' walkways in the winter. She said she spoke to him sometime last week and he was proud to show off his home's renovations. Curious timing: Roth put his Cape Cod-style four-bedroom home up for sale for $549,999 a week before he went missing . ‘He was very happy and delighted and asked us to come over for a barbecue,’ she said, although they never followed through on the invitation. ‘He seemed very happy and everything, but this is before the house went on sale.’ Police are not sure if Roth orchestrated his disappearance in an effort to fake his death, NBC News reported. Roth's wife told investigators she thought her husband had drowned and had no idea about his true whereabouts.","Raymond Roth, 47, vanished last Saturday while swimming at Jones Beach .

Kitted out: Team GB swimmer Amy Smith models the new swimsuit, which could give her an advantage over rivals who haven't got one . Britain’s swimmers will wear kit that could give them as much as a 2 per cent advantage over  many of their rivals in the pursuit of gold at the Olympics. Australian swimming great Ian Thorpe – who helped to test the swimsuits – said he believed they could make a difference. ‘It might sound like a minimal advantage, but it could be significant,’ said the five-times Olympic champion, who described yesterday how he battled winds of 128km in a wind tunnel at a special testing centre in Eindhoven in the Netherlands. It remains the personal choice of British stars such as Rebecca Adlington if they want to wear the swimsuits made by team sponsors adidas, or other brands with which they have endorsement contracts. But adidas say up to 70 per cent of Britain’s swimmers will be wearing them and experts from the company’s 80-strong innovations department believe they could be the difference between gold and silver. The swimsuits will also be worn by the Germans, the French and some of the Australians. Udo Mueller, a spokesman for the adidas innovations department, said: ‘We believe we have created a suit that will give all the swimmers who wear it a big advantage. ‘We tested it against all our rivals and it absorbs 32 per cent less water than all the other manufacturers’ [kit]. ‘It is also incredibly light. In 2008 in Beijing, the suit [German swimmer] Britta Steffen wore to win two gold medals was 208g. The suit she will wear here in London is under 100g. ‘In all we believe it could see a  2 per cent improvement in performance. We cannot be certain because it has never been tested in the Olympics. ‘But in testing our swimmers were very impressed. Because of the positioning of the seams, because of the material we use, because of what we call the hydrophobic finish and the way the compression aspects of the suit support the muscles, it gives the swimmers a better position in the water. ‘When Britta tested the suit she could feel the difference. As I said, it could be of huge benefit to the swimmers.’ FINA, swimming’s world governing body, banned an earlier type of special bodysuit after it contributed to the fall of several world records at the 2009 world championship in Rome. And even though the new adidas suit complies with FINA regulations, there is clearly an advantage to be gained with the technology being used. Only yesterday American swimmer Ryan . Lochte, a three-time Olympic champion and the man looking to end the . dominance of his countryman Michael Phelps at the London Olympics, . expressed his disappointment that some swimmers could have an edge . because of nothing more than their brand of swimsuit. Personal choice: Rebecca Adlington in training, clad in her high-tech swimsuit . Mixed feelings: Australian swimmer Ian Thorpe, left, helped test the swimsuits. But U.S. swimmer Ryan Lochte, right, expressed disappointment that some swimmers would have an edge just because of their swimsuits . ‘If it was up to me, we would all go back to swimming in banana hammocks,’ said Lochte with a smile, before informing his audience that he was using a ‘technical term’ for the old-style briefs that are better known as Speedos. ‘That way the best swimmer would simply emerge.’ Britain’s athletes in other sports could also gain an advantage because of advanced clothing technology. At the Tour de France Bradley Wiggins wore an adidas bodysuit that experts believe could have shaved as much as 30 seconds off his time in the final time-trial, allowing him to cement his historic win earlier this week. The same suit will be available to Wiggins and his British cycling team-mates as they compete in the Olympics.","But is it right athletes should have an edge because of their brand of kit?

Jesse Jackson Jr., seen in 2008, is receiving treatment at a facility in Arizona after collapsing at his home in Washington, D.C. two months ago . Congressman Jesse Jackson Jr. is suffering from debilitating depression and even collapsed at his home in Washington two months ago it’s been revealed after his office and family's near eight weeks of silence. Offering new detail into her husband's secretive leave of absence, the Illinois Congressman's wife reveals his inpatient evaluation for depression and 'gastrointestinal issues' while dispelling rumours he tried to commit suicide. ‘Jesse told his father he was so exhausted, he couldn’t take another step,’ Sandi Jackson recalled to the Chicago Sun-Times of the moments before her husband's collapse on June 10. ‘I was in Chicago, when Jesse —who was . at home in Washington, D.C., collapsed,’ she told the paper. ‘His . father, Rev. Jackson, called him on the phone and felt he didn’t sound . right. She said that . contrary to the rumours, her husband did not try to kill himself and was . not being treated for alcohol or drug addiction. 'No, no, none of that is true,' she said. The . Chicago Democrat and son of civil rights leader the Rev. Jesse Jackson . has since June 10 been off the job for nearly eight weeks. Throughout that time, his office has . released little information, and only revealed his whereabouts a week . ago, when Jackson was transferred to the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota. In . that announcement, Jackson's office said he was undergoing 'extensive . inpatient evaluation for depression and gastrointestinal issues.' Stressful time: The timing of Jackson's medical leave raised flags coming during an ethics investigation into his possible connections to the scandal-clad former Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich . Investigation: Blagojevich, left of then-Senator Barack Obama and Chicago Mayor Richard M. Daley, was arrested on federal corruption charges with Jackson accused of raising money for him in exchange for Obama's vacated Senate seat . 'His collapse was D-Day for us,' his wife told Sun-Times columnist Michael Sneed, adding that her husband had become 'completely debilitated by depression.' The congressman's father and his brother Yusef took him to George Washington hospital, she said. 'He called and told me not to worry, but it was obvious he was suffering from a form of depression,' Mrs. Jackson said. 'So Yusef took him at my suggestion to the Sierra Tucson Treatment Center in Arizona, where they specialize in mental health.' She said it was there that a question arose about whether the depression could be 'due to a lack of nutrients' and linked to a 2004 procedure he underwent to help him lose weight. Doctors at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn., are considering that possibility, she said. 'They are now trying to find out if his depression, which has not yet been diagnosed as a bipolar disorder, is connected to the weight-loss surgery. We don't know,' she said. 'Jesse is now gaining weight and eating and feeling better in that sense, but he is still very depressed.' Help: His father Rev Jesse Jackson, pictured, decided his son didn't sound right, prompting him to take him to the George Washington Hospital . Treatment: The Illinois representative is receiving treatment at the Sierra Tucson Treatment Center in Arizona, pictured, after first transferred to the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota . The timing of Jackson's medical leave has raised questions, in part because Jackson is facing an ethics investigation in the U.S. House connected to imprisoned former Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich. The House Ethics Committee is investigating allegations that Jackson was involved in discussions about raising money for Blagojevich's campaign in exchange for the then-governor appointing him to President Barack Obama's vacated U.S. Senate seat. Jackson was not charged and has repeatedly denied wrongdoing. Days before Jackson's office announced his leave, a fundraiser and family friend also involved in the probe, Raghuveer Nayak, was arrested and charged with unrelated medical fraud charges. Depression: Seen here in 2004, it's the same year he underwent a procedure to help him lose weight which doctors say could be behind his recent depression, due to a resulting lack of nutrients . But Mrs. Jackson said her husband's family and staff had already decided to impose a news blackout at the start of his treatment 'to enable him to heal,' and she said her husband isn't aware of Nayak's arrest. 'He doesn't know anything about the indictment,' she said. Sandi Jackson could not say when her husband might return to work. 'I fully expect him to return to work, but not a day before the doctor says it's OK. That's the word we are waiting for,' she said.","Wife Sandi Jackson dispels rumours husband tried to commit suicide and is receiving drug treatment .

Jason Kenny, 24, powered to victory over Frenchman Gregory Bauge in the men’s sprint in front of 6,000 baying fans. It was Britain’s fifth track cycling gold out of seven events. There are hopes of three more today with Sir Chris Hoy, Victoria Pendleton and Laura Trott all expected to win medals. Scroll down for video . Champion: Jason Kenny kisses his sprint gold medal after a phenomenal victory over French world champion Gregory Bauge . Going for gold: 24-year-old Jason Kenny overpowered Gregory Bauge in their final, taking his personal Olympics gold medal haul to three . But yesterday the French team’s . dejected director, Isabelle Gautheron, complained that the British stars . are using ‘magic wheels’. ‘We are asking a lot of questions: how have they gained so many tenths of seconds?’ she said. ‘Have they found a new training . process based on certain energy pathways? I am not talking about any . illicit product, because anti-doping tests are so strong. ‘We are looking a lot at the kit they . use. They hide their wheels a lot. The ones for the bikes they race on . are put in wheel covers at the finish.’ The dejected director of the French cycling team, Isabelle Gautheron, left, has accused Britain's cyclists of using 'magic wheels', a claim denied by Team GB's performance director Dave Brailsford, right . Last night Britain’s bemused cycling . performance director Dave Brailsford said: ‘It’s interesting that people . are starting to ask questions. 'It’s no different from when we raced the last three-and-a-half weeks at the Tour de France. 'It’s the same method, the same philosophy and essentially fantastic coaching which is the only secret weapon we possess. ‘As far as the Olympic Games go, only two weeks are important – one week in Beijing, one week here. And we’ve peaked for both.’ Last week French President Francois . Hollande taunted Britain for its lack of early gold medal success. But . Team GB is now well clear of France in the medals table. Bolton-born Kenny was picked ahead of . Olympic legend Sir Chris Hoy, but emphatically beat seven-time world . champion Bauge, the favourite for the title, to take the gold. It was Kenny’s second of the Games . and adds to the one he won in Beijing. He is already being tipped for . more medals at Rio in 2016. ‘It’s amazing,’ he admitted, ‘I hadn’t even thought about it until we got on to that last ride and it suddenly dawned on me. ‘The battle I had just to get here . with Chris [Hoy] – I thought I’d better not mess this one up. Now I am . really pleased to deliver for the team.’ Victory: Great Britain's Jason Kenny (left) celebrates defeating France's Gregory Bauge to win gold in the Men's Sprint Final .

Stamp of approval: The Royal Mail have unveiled a first class stamp to celebrate Kenny's success . ‘It dawned on me that if Chris had . been in my shoes there was no way he would have lost. It is a shame that . we could not have two of us in here. ‘He has that real killer instinct . which is why he has so many medals. 'And my final ride was not that . amazing if I am honest. I just let the crowd carry me home.’ Hoy beat Kenny in the 2008 final but after a rule change only one of them could represent Britain in London. Within moments of Kenny’s victory, Hoy . tweeted: ‘That was PHENOMENAL by Jason Kenny. So happy and proud of . him, well deserved mate.’ Jason Kenny overpowers Gregory Bauge during race one of their Olympic sprint final . Team GB's cycling kit has been the subject of allegation by the director of the rival French team . Somewhat ironically, the manufacturer of Team GB's wheels is a French company, which also supplies the Australian and French national teams. And the company concerned, Mavic, has said all of the teams it supplies have exactly the same wheels. But this still hasn't stopped the director of the French cycling team from suggesting that Team GB's wheels are somehow 'magic'. 'Do they really have Mavic wheels?' Isabelle Gautheron has asked. An apparent partnership with McLaren might well be the source of the French director's ire. When asked about the exact specifications of the British cycling team's kit, Matt Parker, who is in charge of developing the technology used by the team, has said only that the kit is top of the range. Britain's cyclists, including Victoria Pendleton, pictured, have met with extraordinary success at London 2012 . 'We make sure the riders have the very best equipment available to them,' he told French newspaper L'Equipe who asked about the allegations. Chris Boardman, head of British Cycling's research and development group known as the Secret Squirrel Club, has laughed off the claims of magic wheels, however. He said: 'It makes me smile. We used those wheels in Athens. 'It's the least technologically advanced piece of equipment that there is. It hasn't changed since '96 when Mavic introduced the five-spoke wheel, it's still the standard now.' Boardman declined to reveal the gains made by technology, but was at a loss to explain why rival nations are not following Britain's lead by doing research in wind tunnels. 'I could quantify it, but I'm not going to,' Boardman said. 'All of the riders have been in a wind tunnel...they're the biggest lump, so they've invested a lot of time sitting (there). 'Chris Hoy's done eight-hour days sitting in a wind tunnel, helping us develop things and improving his own position.' 'The rest of the world has known since Beijing - well, they should've known forever - aerodynamics is a massive part of our sport,' he said.

It's just the grinding and hard . work and 120 miles a week, week in, week out and long distance events . and what you put into it is what you get out. 'I . want to thank everyone who has supported me from my childhood until . now. Without all those people that wouldn't have happened and I've just . got to enjoy this moment I guess.' The . gutsy Somali-born athlete, who coined the motto 'Go Hard or Go Home', . has clearly more than stepped it up a gear since a disappointing Olympic . debut in Beijing 2008 when he failed to reach the 5,000m final.

Gold run: Mo Farah powered ahead of the field in the closing stages of the 10,000m to claim Britain's sixth gold of an extraordinary day . Moment of glory: Farah beats U.S. runner Galen Rupp to the line in the . 10,000m, before collapsing to his knees with joy after . the race . Proud to be British: Farah flies a Union Jack moments after dominating the field to claim gold in the 10,000m . Back in June Farah insisted he could still improve despite becoming the first man to retain the 5,000m title in the history of the European Championships. The packed stadium was already buzzing from Jessica Ennis's gold in the heptathlon and a surprise victory from Greg Rutherford in the long jump at the Olympic Stadium. London 2012 chairman Lord Coe was with Prime Minister David Cameron in the Olympic Stadium among the packed crowd cheering his fellow Sheffield athlete to victory. He said Ennis was 'absolutely sensational' adding: 'Faultless throughout. Jess has nerves of steel and she has delivered a massive British moment which will inspire for generations to come.' Of Rutherford's victory, he said: 'A wonderful achievement. Greg is always capable on his day of beating the best. I am so delighted he chose London as one of his days. Farah spends most of his time in the United States where he has been able to train away from the spotlight. In the big competitions, the Ethiopians have the advantage of working as a team against him.Farah spent most of his early life in Djibouti and arrived in London when he was eight to join his father. He grew up in Hanworth, west London. Farah's story from the poverty-stricken streets of Somalia to top flight athletics is one that serves as an inspiration, both in Britain and his place of birth. His charity - the Mo Farah Foundation - is helping to provide life-saving aid to some of the millions of people facing starvation and disease in East Africa. Strong home support is key. Farah currently lives in Portland, Oregon, with his wife and daughter. He is coached by Alberto Salazar and runs for the Nike Oregon Project. Aside from athletics, Farah's other sporting passion is Arsenal football club. He has been an Arsenal fan from a young age - even though his father was a massive Manchester United fan. Farah notes: 'I'm not as quick as Theo Walcott but I've got endurance.' As with most British athletes competing in a home Games is something special. He said ahead of London 2012: 'I always wanted to be Olympic and World champion so having the Games in London is a massive bonus. 'If it comes down to the last 100m and people are shouting your name, it's going to give you that extra boost.' 1983: March 23 - Born in Mogadishu, Somalia.

The neo-Nazi who killed six worshippers at a Sikh temple on Sunday morning died after turning the gun on himself, it was revealed today. It was originally believed that Wade Michael Page had been killed by a police officer who was wounded after responding to the shooting. Special agent Teresa Carlson told reporters in Milwaukee that the 41-year-old gunman shot himself in the head after the second police officer responding to the scene shot him in the stomach. The disturbing moment was caught on camera. A motive has not yet been given for the senseless massacre. Scroll down to hear the frantic 911 calls .

Wisconsin Sikh temple shooter Wade Page, has been arrested after police . found a gun at her home . Oak Creek Police Officer Sam . Lenda - the second officer who . responded to the scene - has been credited with shooting Page in the stomach. 'It is an amazing shot and thank goodness,' Carlson said today. The first responding officer, Lt Brian Murphy, was . shot nine times but survived the shooting. Oak Creek Police Chief John . Edwards said at the news conference that Murphy has started walking . around again. Carlson said the FBI had received 101 leads 'worldwide' during its . investigation but reaffirmed that no one else other than Page has been . connected to the shooting. It comes on the same day as Page's . former girlfriend Misty Cook, from Milwaukee, was arrested after a gun . was found at her home. She and Page were said to have broken up shortly . before the Wisconsin massacre. Wade Page was said to have harboured white supremacist views and would rant . about a 'racial holy war', according to an old friend of his from the army. The gunman was a . 'gentle young man' when growing up, according to his mother - but by the . time he enlisted in the Army in Milwaukee in 1992, he was already a . neo-Nazi sympathiser. Christopher Robillard, another former . soldier, told CNN that Page was his 'closest friend' in the military, . but that even then he had troubling political beliefs. The future killer was 'a very kind, . very smart individual' who 'loved his friends', according to Mr . Robillard, who added that Page was 'one of those guys with a soft spot'. But Mr Robillard said that his friend . was 'involved with white supremacy,' and continued: 'He would talk . about the racial holy war, like he wanted it to come. 'But to me, he didn't seem like the type of person to go out and hurt people. 'I never pictured him as someone who would do anything. I thought maybe he was just saying it for attention.'

After Page was discharged from the . Army in 1998 for turning up drunk at parade, he apparently moved to . Denver, where he 'was basically living on the streets'. During this difficult time, according . to Mr Robillard, Page became more involved in the supremacist movement, . joining his first racist band - but the group kicked him out after his . girlfriend left him for a bandmate. Mr Robillard began to lose touch with . his fellow veteran, and could not understand the increasing violence of . Page's political views. 'I asked him why he was aligning himself with this stuff,' he said. 'He really didn't answer. He would duck it.'

As legal and marital woes mount against NFL star Chad Johnson, he now has nowhere to play football. Johnson signed a one-year deal with the Miami Dolphins - worth just under $1million - in June to revive his career after he was released by the New England Patriots. But the Dolphins have now cut ties with the wide receiver, after team officials met with him following his release from jail for allegedly head-butting his wife of just one month. Johnson allegedly attacked his wife, Evelyn Lozada, during an argument outside their Miami home after she confronted him about a condom receipt she found in their car’s trunk. Scroll down for video of court appearance . Released: NFL star Chad Johnson bonded out of jail 16 hours after being arrested for allegedly headbutting his new wife Evelyn Lozada, right, outside their home in Davie, Florida on Saturday night . The team announced via the team's website and Twitter late Sunday that they terminated Johnson's contract. He was released from Broward County . jail at 1pm on $2,500 bond after appearing in court earlier Sunday . morning, where he was charged with battery and domestic violence. Johnson's defense attorney, Adam Swickle, said a no-contact order has been issued that prevents Johnson from contacting Lozada. Swickle accompanied Johnson as he walked free from jail on Sunday at lunchtime wearing casual gray tracksuit pants and Croc shoes. Johnson and his wife were at dinner when she confronted him about a receipt she had found for a box of condoms, said Davie police Capt Dale Engle. The argument got heated and continued on the drive home, he said. Charged: Johnson has been charged with battery and domestic violence. According to the police report, his wife fled to a neighbour's house fearing for her safety after Johnson attacked her . When they arrived in their driveway in Davie, the 34-year-old Johnson head-butted Lozada, she told police. According . to the police report, Johnson started screaming at his wife, yelling, . ‘I don’t give a f***! I don’t give a f*** about my career!’ Fearing for her safety, Lozada fled to a neighbour’s house and called 911 from there, the report says. TMZ posted the police report which says that Johnson then drove around the neighbour searching for his wife. However, Johnson told the officer that he went for a drive to give Lozada time to calm down, according to the document. Allegations: Dolphins star Chad 'Ochocino Johnson' has been charged with headbutting his new wife in a car in Davie, Florida . The responding officer who filed the report said that Johnson admitted to having an argument but said that Lozada had head-butted him. Lozada sustained a 3inch laceration on her head while Johnson suffered no injuries, the report states. Lozada, who is on the reality show, ‘Basketball Wives,’ was treated at a hospital for a 3-inch cut to her forehead, Engle said. Johnson, who changed his last name back to Johnson from Ochocinco after his July 4 wedding to Lozada, was held Saturday night in Broward County Jail. Johnson's lawyer, Adam Swickle, said in court today, 'Mr. Johnson has been a resident of the state of Florida for pretty much his entire life. He has no prior offenses, and essentially, we're asking for the court to set a standard bond.' The state asked for a bond of $5,000 or more. Dolphins spokesman Harvey Greene originally said the team was 'aware of the situation' and were in the process of gathering of relevant information.' Johnson's agent, Drew Rosenhaus, declined to comment. Johnson signed with the Dolphins in . June, four days after he was released by New England. A six-time Pro . Bowl receiver with Cincinnati, he caught only 15 passes in 15 games for . the Patriots last year after they acquired him in a trade for a pair of . draft picks. On Friday . night in the Dolphins' 20-7 loss to Tampa Bay in the exhibition opener, . Johnson let the only pass thrown to him slip through his hands. Court appearance: Johnson appeared at Broward County court on Sunday morning, where he was charged with battery and domestic violence and had his bond set at $2,500 by Judge Mindy Solomon . Lovers' quarrel: The argument that ended in Johnson's arrest broke out when his wife, Evelyn Lozada, left, confronted him about finding a receipt for condoms . Happy couple: Johnson and Lozada tied the knot on July 4 at Le Chateau des Palmiers on the island of St. Maarten . Johnson was known as Ochocinco for the past four seasons. He chose the name in honour of the No. 85 he wore on his jersey. Johnson and Lozada were prominent in the recent first episode of HBO's 'Hard Knocks: Training Camp with the Miami Dolphins.' As he walked out of the Dolphins' training facility on the first episode of the series documenting the . team's training camp, Johnson jokingly yet prophetically, told team . officials, ‘I'm going to get arrested this weekend.’ While still in college, Johnson was . arrested in connection to a domestic dispute incident, but has since . stayed out of trouble with the law – a fact he mentions in his 2007 . autobiography Ocho Cinco: What Football And Life Have Thrown My Way, . according to the site SB Nation. In a passage addressing an alleged . altercation with an NFL employee, Johnson writes in part: ‘You see, the . funniest part is that people think I’m so bad, but do you see one arrest . on me since I got to the NFL? Do you see me getting suspended for using . drugs or steroids? Do you see anything about me beating up my . girlfriend or some other guys? No, none of that.’ Switching teams: Johnson signed with the Dolphins in June, four days after he was released by the New England Patriots . VH1's ‘Basketball Wives’ is filmed in Miami and also features Shaunie O'Neal, the former wife of former NBA star Shaquille O'Neal. Lozada used to be the fiancee of NBA player Antoine Walker. Johnson and Lozada's lavish wedding at Le Chateau des Palmiers in St. Maarten is supposed to be part of another VH1 reality series that begins in September called, ‘Eve & Ocho,’ according to ESPN.

This latest blow comes just a day after fresh allegations were made of a pedophile sex ring involving the once-prestigious college athletics program. The Middle States Commission on Higher Education has warned the university that it could lose its accreditation because of details uncovered by an internal investigation on Sandusky, which was led by former FBI director Louis Freeh. The commission also considered the severe penalties imposed by the National Collegiate Athletic Association, because of the way the school reacted to allegations against Sandusky. The former assistant football coach for Penn State was convicted of 45 counts of child sex abuse in June. In a statement released on August 8, the commission said Penn State remains accredited while 'on warning', but it wants a monitoring report submitted by the end of next month. At that time, the university must show the steps it has taken to fully comply with governmental requirements and that it's mission is being carried out. Penn State must keep the commission fully informed and comply with standards on leadership and governance, as well as integrity. The commission also wants the report to show how the university will cope financially following the investigation and 'related settlements'. A team from the commission will visit Penn State to 'verify institutional status and progress.' Yesterday, officials said they were confident the university could address all the issues raised by the commission. 'This action has nothing to do with the quality of education our students receive,' said Blannie Bowen, vice provost for academic affairs in a statement posted on the university's website. 'Middle States is focusing on governance, integrity, and financial issues related to information in the Freeh report and other items related to our current situation.' Warning: Penn State University may lose its accreditation over the child sex abuse scandal which has rocked the campus . Bowen added that the body does not issue a warning unless it believes an institution can make improvements. 'This is certainly true for Penn State. 'We're confident that our monitoring report and the site visit will confirm this to the commission,' Bowen added. University president Rodney Erickson said he was also confident officials would be able to 'fully demonstrate our financial stability.' In the meantime, the FBI has opened a new investigation following allegations made yesterday that Sandusky and a prominent Penn State University donor sexually abused two boys together aboard a private plane. Under investigation: The FBI is now looking into fresh allegations that Sandusky was part of a pedophile ring . High hopes: Sandusky was expected to become Penn State's head coach after Joe Paterno, who died in January . Until now, authorities believed Sandusky was a lone abuser. The newest allegations threaten to bring out more horrifying revelations about sexual abuse surrounding the once-prestigious college athletics program. According to Radar Online, federal authorities are looking into the possibility that Sandusky shared his young victims with other pedophiles including a 'very rich, very powerful man connected with the university.' The latest allegations come just over a month . after Sandusky, 68, was convicted on 45 counts of child sexual abuse for . molesting ten boys over the course of 15 years. He now faces 442 years in prison.","Status 'in jeopardy' following internal investigation into sex abuse scandal .

A man suspected of faking his own drowning as part of a scheme to collect on his life insurance policy has been arrested at the hospital where he was receiving psychiatric treatment. Raymond Roth, 47, is accused of wasting police manpower after his son reported that he had drifted out to sea and died while swimming near his home in Long Island, New York on July 28. Officers combed the water near the beach during a massive rescue effort but, days later and 730 miles away from home, Roth was stopped by police for speeding in South Carolina. Arrested: Raymond Roth is escorted by law enforcement officers after being arrested after he allegedly faked his own drowning at a New York beach in a scheme to collect on a life insurance policy . Roth arrived at state park police headquarters in handcuffs on Wednesday wearing a blue polo shirt and white trousers. He will be arraigned in a Long Island courtroom on charges of insurance fraud, conspiracy to commit insurance fraud and falsely reporting an incident. Roth will plead not guilty, attorney Brian Davis said. Roth was arrested at South Nassau Communities Hospital in Oceanside, where he had spent about 10 days undergoing treatment. He was reported missing by his son on July 28 at Jones Beach. The elder Roth was later reported to be in Florida and got a speeding ticket in South Carolina. Scrum: He was arrested at a hospital where he was receiving psychiatric treatment for depression . Charges: Roth is due to be arraigned on Wednesday afternoon on charges of insurance fraud, conspiracy to commit insurance fraud and falsely reporting an incident . 'Scheme': Roth's son Jonathan, left, and his attorney Joey Jackson after his appearance in court on Tuesday on charges that he helped his father to fake his death. Jonathan claims he was coerced . His son, 22-year-old Jonathan, was arrested last week. According to court documents, the pair conspired to get more than $50,000 in life insurance money. But Davis said his client was not aware of an insurance scam and blamed the man's son. 'My client's intent was to disappear, not to cash in on a life insurance policy,' Davis told The Associated Press. He added that Jonathan Roth is the one who tried to cash in on the policy just days after reporting his father's disappearance. 'It was never my client's intent to make a claim,' he said. Days after his disappearance, Raymond Roth was reported to be at a resort in Orlando, Florida and on August 2, he was stopped driving at 90 mph in Santee, South Carolina. When police ran his name, they saw he was listed as missing, but Roth said he was driving back to New York and the officer let him continue. Cost: Tens of thousands of dollars were wasted searching for Roth at Jones Beach, Long Island . Found: Roth left his shoes, wallet, clothing and phone on the beach when attempting to fake his death . Caught: More than a week after his disappearance, Roth was pulled over for speeding in South Carolina . But he failed to show up to a scheduled meeting with police and his attorney claimed he had in fact been admitted to hospital with depression. Jonathan Roth, 22, is free on $10,000 bond. He has pleaded not guilty to conspiracy to commit insurance fraud, filing a false report and other charges. Court papers show he 'was fully aware that his father never walked into the water and had in fact driven off in his own personal vehicle'.. He faces up to 15 years in prison if found guilty. The younger Roth's attorney, Joey Jackson, said his client and his father had a 'strained' relationship and claims he was coerced into going along with the scheme - which Davis has denied. He also claimed he feared for his life after his father left him a threatening voicemail when the scandal went public. Hurt: Roth's wife Evana said she found emails between Roth and her stepson planning the disappearance . Up for sale: Roth had also put his Long Island home on the market days before he faked his death . 'Listen, tough guy. You say you’ve been to the Marines and you can kill and everything else. When I get back, you are gonna do just that. One of us is going to die,' Mr Roth allegedly said. Raymond Roth's wife, Evana, said her husband had not told her of the scheme, and handed over emails she found on the family computer that implicated her stepson. In one dated the day before he vanished, the elder Roth told his son to contact him at an Orlando resort to update him on developments following his disappearance. 'This is a terrible nightmare that I just want to wake up from,’ said 43-year-old Evana last week. 'Why did he do this? I think I’m just numb.’ Raymond Roth had put the family's home up for sale just days before he vanished, and Evana Roth also said her husband had recently been fired from his job in New York City. Police estimated that an air and sea search for Roth cost tens of thousands of dollars.","Raymond Roth disappeared on July 28 during swim with son in Long Island .

SIX more Africans in London for the Olympics were said to have gone missing last night after the end of the 2012 Games. Three from Guinea and three from the Ivory Coast have disappeared as their teammates returned home, prompting speculation they will remain here and try to claim political asylum. It brings the total number of athletes and delegates attending the Games who have vanished from their team camps, failed to return home or claimed asylum to 21. Vanished: Guinean judo competitor Facinet Keita, left, said to have been missing since Saturday . All are here legally because the visas allowing them to stay do not expire until November. Yesterday officials in the Ivory Coast said the unnamed three – two swimmers and a wrestling coach – had failed to return to the Olympic village. Reports also claimed three Guinean athletes had vanished. They were named as swimmer Dede Camara, judo competitor Facinet Keita and runner Aicha Toure, and were said to have been missing since Saturday, the day before the closing ceremony. ‘Three members of the delegation have not returned to the Olympic village,’ said Adama Doumbia, of the ministry of sports and leisure in Ivory Coast. Officials are already looking for four members of the Congo Olympic team. In addition, five members of the Cameroon team, all boxers, have asked to be allowed to stay in Britain rather than return home. They say have been threatened in their home country, and complain that promised Olympic bonuses have been halved. Authorities in Cameroon, which is regarded as one of the more stable countries in Africa, have accused the boxers of wanting to be economic migrants and say they should have returned home with other athletes. Two members of the Sudanese team and one Ethiopian are reported to have sought asylum in the UK. Another Sudanese is missing, and two other members of the Cameroon team – a swimmer and a female footballer – have also disappeared while their compatriots returned home. The London Olympic organising committee said it had notified British police about the missing Cameroonians but added that the athletes would not be infringing immigration laws until their visas expired in November. Congolese judoka Cedric Mandembo disappeared after the closing ceremony and officials have been unable to contact him. He lost his match after 49 seconds and is said to have left the Olympic village without saying where he was going. His compatriot, judo coach Ibula Masengo, boxing trainer Blaise Bekwa, and national technical director of athletics Guy Nkita have also gone missing after walking out of the Olympic village with their luggage. Immigration officials fear that up to 2 per cent of the Olympic visitors from some continents may claim refuge in the UK in the months after the Games, potentially hundreds of individuals. Five boxers in the Cameroonian Olympic team went missing last week from the athletes' village, pictured . Even those from some countries regarded as safe will have to be processed and removed, putting further pressure on the asylum system. At the 2002 Commonwealth Games more than 20 members of one West African country sought asylum in Britain. Before the 2008 Olympics seven members of the Cuban soccer team sought asylum after a qualifying game in the US, and the entire Eritrean national soccer team fled during a 2009 competition in Kenya. Last night the Home Office declined to comment.","Three Guinea athletes and three from Ivory Coast latest to 'disappear'

Unwelcome surprise: Police in Sweden reportedly busted two prostitutes using an apartment they rented from two women through online site Airbnb as a brothel (file picture posed by model) Two women who rented out their apartment through the online service Airbnb returned to discover it had been used by prostitutes as a temporary brothel, it emerged today. They arrived back after a month-long vacation to find a letter from police saying they had busted the sex workers in the act after trailing them to the property. Inside, the owners found pubic hair, a plastic bag of used condoms and other detritus from a makeshift brothel set up by their guests, according to reports. They had rented their flat in Stockholm, Sweden, via Airbnb, which matches people seeking short-term accommodations with those with rooms to let out. One of the homeowners said the women had looked 'very high class, with business suits'. 'It was strange that they would rent an apartment when they clearly could afford a hotel,' she told www.kernelmag.com. 'We feel uneasy about being in our own apartment after this.' It is believed from sources that the apartment owners do not want to pursue legal action, but are looking for compensation from Airbnb. The prostitute bust, which came to light at the weekend, is the latest in a number of alleged horror stories involving apartments rented through Airbnb. Running jokes in the U.S. involve meth addicts with stolen identities trashing homes and similar accusations are said to have emerged in London and eastern Europe. According to The Kernel, some commentators believe the lack of regulation around private rentals could even be encouraging organised crime. Since its launch in 2008 and subsequent steady growth, Airbnb has raised $120million in venture capital funding from investors such as Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and actor Ashton Kutcher. In a statement, the company said: 'We're appalled to hear about this and we will work with the local authorities to investigate the situation. 'We’re also providing ongoing support to the host. While this situation is being investigated, we can't comment further.'","Police bust sex workers in the act after trailing them to Stockholm flat .

The mother of a three-year-old girl with a terminal genetic disorder has pledged to take her to see the Seven Wonders of the World before the condition claims her life. Lola Bloomer is one of just 60 children in the UK living with Ataxia-Telangiectasia, or A-T, an incurable condition that causes increasingly severe disability and premature death. But her mother, Jo, is determined to . make her daughter's short life as full as possible and give her some unforgettable experiences. 'Like a bomb went off': Jo Bloomer was devastated to learn that her daughter Lola had a terminal illness, but has since pledged to show the three-year-old the Seven Wonders of the World to make her life as full as possible . Most A-T sufferers are healthy for around two years, but their balance and co-ordination then begin to deteriorate rapidly. Tragically, many will be forced to use a wheelchair by the age of 10 and will need full-time care. The condition also affects the immune system, leading to frequent chest and lung infections and a high risk of leukaemia and other cancers. With no current cure, children with A-T rarely live beyond their early 20s. Jo, from Plymouth, Devon, who also has a 12-year-old son Will, wants to raise awareness of A-T and find a search for a cure after Lola's diagnosis in May. Hoping for a miracle: Lola has a genetic condition called A-T, which causes increasingly severe disability and premature death . She said: 'Lola was about one-and-a-half when mother's intuition told me something wasn't right. She was clumsy and kept falling into things. 'When I was finally told she had A-T I was devastated. I think I'm still in denial. It's like waiting for a time bomb to go off, waiting for the symptoms to start appearing. 'I could wake up one day and she could have pneumonia and die - it's like Russian roulette. 'Something will get her but I don't know what it will be. 'I'm carrying on from day to day like everything is normal, because it is. I'm just waiting for the day it changes. 'Every day I wake up and look at her and think it's not happening because there aren't really any visual signs yet. 'But I'm a realist and very pragmatic about the things she will and won't be able to do as she gets older, unless a miracle happens.' 'Hardest thing of all': Jo says her daughter loves her dolls and is 'really maternal', but the mother-of-two is heartbroken at the thought Lola won't be able to have children of her own . She added: 'I want to be able to take her to Disneyland and do all the lovely family things with her and Will whilst she can still enjoy them. 'It's my dream to take her to see the seven wonders of the world.' The 'new' seven wonders of the world are the Great Wall of China, the Taj Mahal, the Colosseum in Rome, Christ the Redeemer in Brazil, Petra in Jordan, Machu Picchu in Peru and Chichen Itza in Mexico. Mum-of-two Jo believes that by raising money for the A-T Society and awareness for others, it is helping her to cope with Lola's diagnosis. She said: 'I'm getting heavily into the charity side of things and I think that's my way of coping. 'I want to help the A-T Society raise enough money to research and find a cure for the condition within Lola's lifetime. 'It helps give me hope for the future - the only bit of hope I have. 'I feel like it's my purpose in life to raise awareness of the condition, like I was put here specifically to be Lola's mum. 'It's going to be a rollercoaster but I'm ready for it. 'Our lives are not going to be ruled by Lola's condition - I need to keep life as normal and enjoyable as possible for as long as possible for the sake of both my children. 'People ask me how I cope and I tell them I just have to get on with it - I'm a mum. 'Lola is so beautiful and has so much character, she really is a special soul. 'She loves her dollies and cooking and she's really maternal but knowing that she will never be a mother, get married or have children is one of the hardest things of all. 'The little life she does have needs to be as special as possible, but life doesn't always allow for that. 'If I could afford to I would spend life making sure Lola's life was as enjoyable and enriched as possible. 'I now realise the importance of the saying 'live everyday like it's your last'.' Family friend Kevin McGregor has now pledged to raise £100,000 for Lola by arranging an event called the Mega-Tri. The event will see 20 men and women as far away as Ireland, Singapore and France come together to embark on a mega-triathalon in aid of the A-T Society next April. A-T is caused by a defect known as 'mutation' on a particular gene, meaning that the gene cannot carry out its function properly. Due to this the gene cannot properly produce a protein called ATM, which should be in every cell. When two people carrying a single copy of the mutated gene have a child together and pass the mutated gene on, there is a one in four chance that the child will have A-T.

A police investigation into alleged police brutality is underway in Michigan after six officers shot a homeless man 46 times after he failed to follow their instructions in a parking lot. Amateur video captures the fatal exchange between Saginaw police and 49-year-old Milton Hall after he called the police following an argument with a convenience store clerk. Refusing to drop a knife after repeated requests, the video shows officers unleash a volley of bullets at the agitated Hall in a move his mother, Jewel Hall Milton, described as a 'firing squad dressed in police uniforms.' Scroll Down for Video . Milton Hall is circled standing in the parking lot of a convenience store in Saginaw, Michigan in a encounter with police . Shot on July 1st, in the parking lot of West Genessee avenue, the investigation into the use of excessive police force by the officers has taken at least six weeks and caused anger and impatience amongst residents in the town of 50,000 in central Michigan. Police in Saginaw said that Hall had just had a confrontation with a convenience store clerk and in the video the 49-year-old homeless man can be heard to say, 'My name is Milton Hall, I just called 911. My name is Milton, and I'm pi**ed off.' A female officer can be heard to say 'Put the knife down, put the knife down' to which Hall replies, 'I ain't putting sh*t down.' Eventually Hall is seen to move to the left of the frame in the video and then is shot in a barrage of bullets of which at least 30 can be heard to ring out. Officer's of Saginaw Police Department scream at Hall to drop the knife he is carrying but the homeless man refuses to follow their instructions . The six police officers begin to fire a volley of bullets at Hall who can be seen in the picture doubling up and falling to the ground . The shooting was witnessed by traffic and passers-by. 'All of a sudden, pow, pow, pow, pow, pow...and he drops,' said Anthony Baber, who was in his car in the parking lot when the shooting occurred. Saginaw County Prosecutor Michael Thomas said to CNN that the squad of police opened fire 'because apparently, at this point in time, he was threatening to assault police.' The County Prosecutor and Saginaw police have been involved in an investigation into the shooting and Saginaw Police Chief Gerald Cliff said that Hall was 'known to be an assaultive person' with 'a long history' of involvement with authorities, 'not only with police from our department but with the county.' Hall had been jailed for vagrancy in the past said his cousin, Mike Washington, but, 'He was not violent'. Jewel Hall Milton, Hall's mother said that her son was mentally ill and admitted to being furious with police in addition to her obvious distress. Milton Hall (left and right) was 49-years old and homeless. He had spent time in prison for vagrancy and was known to police in Saginaw . 'It appeared to be a firing squad dressed in police uniforms,' said Milton from her home in Albuquerque, New Mexico. 'There was another way. They did not have to kill him. He had not done anything. He was not violent. He was not a murderer. He was not a criminal.' She said that before her son became homeless he was a civil rights activist, received Social Security disability payments for mental illness and had lived in the area for 35 years. 'Everybody knew him. The police knew him well,' said Milton. 'So that's another question: they knew him, so why? Why did they kill him? A makeshift memorial has been set up in the parking lot where Milton Hall died . Jewel Hall Milton described the shootings as a 'firing squad dressed in police uniforms.' 'I'm stunned that six human beings would stand in front of one human being and fire 46 shots. 'I just don't understand that. It's a lot of pain in that because it only takes one shot, so the question is why?' Distraught, Milton questioned why none of the camera's in the police squad cars were operational.

The ex-wife of Soham killer Ian Huntley has told of how she could tell her husband was responsible from the moment she heard him speak on television about the two girls' deaths. The school caretaker was interviewed on TV shortly after Holly Wells and Jessica ­Chapman went missing, as the world watched in ignorance of his guilt. But Claire Evans, who had suffered sickening abuse at Huntley's hands herself, said she knew immediately that he was involved. Scroll down for video . Ian Huntley's ex-wife, Claire Evans, pictured here leaving Peterborough Magistrates' Court, says he nearly killed her . 'I couldn't move and I felt totally paralysed when I saw him on TV. 'I just knew it - I had a gut . instinct.I could tell from the way he was talking and his body language . that he had done something. That he was responsible for killing the . girls.' Ms Evans, who was married to Huntley for four years, told the Sunday Mirror that ten years on, she is still wracked with guilt over the deaths of the two 10-year-olds. Despite her suspicions after his interview, which took place because the girls were thought to have passed his home, she kept quiet. 'His evilness all came flooding back,' she said. 'He seemed so cocky, and it was scary. I felt weak again, like when he would abuse me when we were married.' When he was later arrested and charged, she was filled with horror, believing she could have saved their lives by speaking out. It soon emerged that there was nothing she could have done because he had killed them straight away - but she admitted she still regrets staying quiet. She also believes that if Huntley had ­succeeded in his attempt to strangle her when they were together several years earlier, the schoolgirls would be alive today. She revealed for the first time: 'If Ian had killed me when he had his hands around my . throat, I sometimes feel none of this would have happened . Killer: Huntley is serving two life sentences with a minimum of 40 years for the murders. 'He would have been done for my murder and would never have been free to ruin the lives of those two defenceless little girls.' Ms Evans, 36, . endured years of ­physical and mental abuse at the hands of their . killer, now 38. He sexually assaulted her, ­attacked her in the shower and . hacked off her hair so that no other man would find her ­attractive. She was even forced to abort their baby after Huntley ­threatened: 'Have that child and I’ll do things to it.' Ms Evans, who has since married for a third time and is now a mum of two, also told how ­17 years ago Huntley came within seconds of killing her as he tried to crush her windpipe. She only survived because she managed to grab hold of a metal hob cover and hit him over the head with it.

The pair met in 1994, eight years before the murders of Holly and Jessica, while they were both working in a food factory in Grimsby, Lincolnshire. Huntley, then 20, was a cleaner while Ms Evans, who was 18, worked as a ­production operator. They kissed at the factory's Christmas party and a whirlwind romance followed. Within days Ms Evans had moved into Huntley’s one-bedroom flat and a month later he had proposed. The pair got married in January 1995, and soon after the relationship soon became abusive and his behaviour increasingly more bizarre and psychotic. Ms Evans told how she went from a . healthy size 12 to a minuscule size four because of the stress. But although she . felt trapped, she believed she had no alternative but to stick with . Huntley. Ms Evans also revealed that she was forced to make the heart-breaking decision to have a . termination to abort his child - because she was so scared about what . Huntley would do to it. When Huntley eventually found out about the termination, he beat her up. He finally granted Ms Evans a divorce in . 1999.

Furious: Teenager Nikki Brewer (pictured) was left in a wheelchair after a brutal attack by a drunken thug . A woman left needing a wheelchair following a street attack will never see justice done after a mix-up by police and prosecutors allowed the man to avoid court. Nikki Brewer, 21, was walking home with a friend after a night out when she was confronted by a drunken yob. Footage caught on a CCTV camera showed him grabbing her hair and yanking her head back before delivering a powerful punch that sent her sprawling to the ground in Colchester. Mrs Brewer now suffers permanent back pain and often needs a wheelchair to get around. Doctors have also diagnosed a degenerative disease affecting her nerves which was probably triggered by the injuries she sustained. Police appealed for witnesses on BBC’s Crimewatch and a 31-year-old man was arrested in January this year for common assault. But he has now been told he will not face prosecution as he was not brought before magistrates within a six-month time limit that applies to summary-only offences. If he had been charged with a more serious offence, such as actual bodily harm, no time limit would have applied. The exact reason for the delay was mired in confusion yesterday as Essex Police and the Crown Prosecution Service blamed each other for failing to take action. The force said it was given advice by the CPS that Mrs Brewer’s injuries were not serious enough to warrant arresting the suspect for the more serious offence. Do you know this man?

It also claimed prosecutors had . decided not to proceed with the case – but the CPS responded by saying . it had never been handed a file of evidence. ‘This man is still out there and could . do the same thing to someone else,’ said Mrs Brewer, an administrator . for the Multiple Sclerosis Centre near her home. ‘It is so frustrating . that he has been able to walk free.’ Mrs Brewer, who is married to therapy . co-ordinator Lee, 22, was 18 when she was attacked on Colchester High .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 09:16 EST, 21 August 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 11:04 EST, 21 August 2012 . A new biography of disgraced Penn State football coach Joe Paterno is laying out new details about his relationship with Jerry Sandusky, including the fact that the two hardly got along - if ever. In his biography, Paterno, former Sports Illustrated columnist Joe Posnanski writes that the once-iconic coach became irritated with his defensive coordinator when he realised that Sandusky's first priority did not appear to be Penn State football. Paterno, affectionately called 'JoePa' by students, was apparently bothered that Sandusky was focused more on his charity, the Second Mile, than team meetings and recruiting new players. Tension: Despite the closeness shown in this August 6, 1999, photo, Joe Paterno, right, did not apparently get along with his defensive coordinator Jerry Sandusky, left . Fired: Joe Paterno, pictured on November 9, 2011 - the day he was fired from Penn State - died of lung cancer in January . The Second Mile was later found to be the organisation through which Sandusky met and groomed his victims. In the book, which was published today, Posnanski writes: 'The tension between Paterno and Sandusky gurgled just below the surface.' As the scandal erupted, it was revealed that Paterno had been told by graduate assistant Mike McQueary that Sandusky had raped a boy in the Penn State locker room showers. In addition, an independent report conducted by former FBI director Louis Freeh, concluded that Paterno, as well as other Penn State bigwigs, 'failed to protect against a child sexual predator harming children for over a decade.' Book: In Paterno, a biography of the late coach, Joe Posnanski highlights Paterno's relationship with former Penn State defensive coordinator Jerry Sandusky . Fall from grace: Joe Paterno (pictured with the Penn State football team in 2004) coached the team for nearly 50 years . Disgrace: Workers took out a Joe Paterno statue last month that was stationed outside Beaver . Stadium, which was there to honour the once-legendary coach . Posnanski's book, however disputes those claims, saying that Paterno did not know Sandusky had sexually abused children, and when he read the list of charges against Sandusky, he asked his son Scott: 'What is sodomy, anyway?' Speaking to Sports Illustrated shortly after his retirement in December 1999, Sandusky gave a small glimpse into his relationship with Paterno when asked if he’d miss him. Sandusky said: 'Well, not exactly. You have to understand that so much of our time was spent under stress, figuring out how to win. That takes a toll. We've had our battles. Jailed: Ex-Penn State defensive coordinator Jerry Sandusky was convicted in June of sexually assaulting 10 boys over 15 years . ‘I've quit. I've been fired. I've walked around the building to cool off.' But Sandusky was not his only enemy, as the book reveals that Paterno, who coached the team for nearly 50 years, had bad blood with the Penn State board of trustees, according to Dan . McGinn, the PR specialist who worked with the Paterno family when the . scandal broke. As . early as 2004, Paterno had clashed with Penn State University President . Graham Spanier and did not have allies who would support him, McGinn . said, citing Paterno family adviser Guido D'Elia. 'The board started to turn [in 2004], we don't have anybody on the board now,' D'Elia told McGinn. Posnanski's book also details the moments after Paterno was fired at the height of the Sandusky scandal, saying that the news was met with nonstop tears. 'Paterno met with his coaches at his house. He sobbed uncontrollably. This was his bad day,' Posanksi writes in his biography, Paterno. After . Sandusky was arrested on November 5, 2011 and charged with multiple . counts of sexual abuse, Paterno said on November 9 that he would resign . at the end of the season from his coaching post at Penn State after 46 . years. But the Penn State . board rejected his resignation and instead voted to fire Paterno, . delivering the news in a late night telephone call. Tensions: Paterno hardly got along with his former assistant Jerry Sandusky, left, even before allegations of child sex abuse were raised . Goodbye to JoePa: Penn State students remember former head football coach Joe Paterno after his death on January 22, 2012 . 'My . name. I have spent my whole life trying to make that name mean . something. And now it's gone,' he told his son Jay, who had served on . the coaching staff of the Penn State Nittany Lions football team under . his father. On November 18, the family revealed that Paterno was suffering from a treatable form of lung cancer. On January 22, 2012, Paterno died at the age of 85. An . independent report of the scandal, conducted by former FBI director . Louis Freeh, concluded that Paterno, president Graham Spanier, athletic . director Tim Curley and vice president Gary Schultz 'failed to protect . against a child sexual predator harming children for over a decade.' The report, released in July, called the school officials 'callous’ for their disregard of the child victims. After . a highly publicized trial in June 2012, Sandusky, 68, was convicted on . 45 criminal counts for sexually abusing 10 victims. He will be sentenced in September.","New biography of longtime coach reveals new details of Paterno's relationship with Sandusky .

"By . Kerry Mcdermott . PUBLISHED: . 11:55 EST, 22 August 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 11:55 EST, 22 August 2012 . An Israeli archaeologist who discovered that his relatives were killed at Sobibor has used his skills to shed new light on the dark history of the notorious Nazi death camp. After learning that two of his uncles were murdered at Sobibor Yoram Haimi launched a landmark excavation project at the site of the camp in east Poland, where some 250,000 Jews are believed to have been murdered by the Nazis during World War II. Unlike other locations that were given at least a facade of being prison or labour camps, Sobibor - along with neighbouring camps Belzec and Trenblinka - was designed specifically for the mass extermination of Jews, with victims transported to the site in cattle cars and gassed almost immediately. Sobibor was bulldozed to the ground by the Nazis in 1943 in an attempt to cover their tracks, but Mr Haimi has managed to pinpoint the location of the gas chambers where hundreds of thousands of people were sent to their death over an 18 month period. Future scholarship: Israeli students listen as Yoram Haimi discusses the findings of his excavations, which have provided a new insight into the workings of Sobibor . The Nazis leveled the camp and replanted over it following an uprising at the site in 1943. This, combined with the fact that there were so few survivors of Sobibor - only 64 were known - has made researching Sobibor famously difficult. New evidence: The archaeologist believes the death toll at the camp in east Poland may be even higher than previously thought . Researchers were able to gain a limited understanding of how Sobibor operated from partial German documentation and the memories of the few survivors that did live to tell their tale - but there has never been an authentic layout of the death camp. 'I feel like I am an investigator in a criminal forensic laboratory,' said Mr Haimi, 51. 'After all, it is a murder scene.' Over five years of excavations, Haimi has been able to remap the camp and has unearthed thousands of items; including jewellery, keys and coins that have helped him to identify some of Sobibor's formerly nameless victims. The heavy concentration of ashes uncovered at the site has led the archaeologist to believe that far more than 250,000 Jews were actually killed at the death camp. 'Because of the lack of information about Sobibor, every little piece of information is significant,' Mr Haimi told Associated Press from his home in Israel. 'No one knew where the gas chambers were. The Germans didn't want anyone to find out what was there, but thanks to what we have done, they didn't succeed.' The archaeologist said the most touching artefact uncovered by his investigations was an engraved metal identification tag belonging to a six-year-old Jewish girl murdered at the camp. Mr Haimi called Lea Judith de la Penha - whose death at the camp was confirmed by Israel's Yad Vashem Holocaust memorial - the 'symbol of Sobibor'. 'The Germans didn't discriminate. They killed little girls too,' he said. 'This thing [the tag] has been waiting for 70 years for somebody to find it.' 'Symbol of Sobibor': This engraved identity tag retrieved from the site belonged to a six-year-old Jewish girl murdered at the camp . Haimi's digs, backed . by Yad Vashem, could serve as a template for future scholarship into . the Holocaust, in which the Nazis and their collaborators killed about 6 . million Jews. 'I think . the use of archaeology offers the possibility of giving us information . that we didn't have before,' Deborah Lipstadt, a prominent American . Holocaust historian from Emory University, said. 'It gives us another . perspective when we are at the stage when we have very few people who . can speak in the first person singular.' On the subject of whether the archaeological evidence points to higher death toll at Sobibor than previously thought, she said: 'It is not out of sync with other research that has been done'. Mr Haimi's . basic method is similar to what he does at home in Israel, where he does digs for the country's antiquities authority in the south - cutting out . squares of land and sifting the earth through a filter. Because of the . difficult conditions at Sobibor and the sensitive nature of the effort, . he is also relying on more non-invasive, high-tech aids such as . ground-penetrating radar and global positioning satellite imaging. Family history: Archaeologist Yoram Haimi talks to students from Israel's Dror School about his work at the site of the infamous Sobibor death camp . Traces of the past: Mr Haimi and his team have uncovered thousands of personal items belonging to Sobibor victims over five years of excavations . Based . on debris collected and patterns in the soil, he has been able to . figure out where the Nazis placed poles to hold up the camp's barbed . wire fences. That led him . to his major breakthrough — the mapping of what the Germans called the . Himmelfahrsstrasse, or the 'Road to Heaven', a path upon which the . inmates were marched naked into the gas chambers. He determined its . route by the poles that marked the path and from that, he determined where . the gas chambers would have been located. He . also discovered that another encampment was not located where . originally thought and uncovered an internal train route within Sobibor. He dug up mounds of bullets at killing sites, utensils from where he . believes the camp kitchen was located and a swastika insignia of a Nazi . officer. During the course of the excavations he and his Polish partner Wojciech Mazurek, helped by some 20 labourers, have retrieved thousands of personal items belonging to Sobibor victims; from eye glasses, perfume bottles and dentures, to a child's Mickey Mouse pin and engraved jewellery.He . also uncovered a unique version of the yellow star Jews were forced to . wear by the Nazis, made out of metal instead of cloth, which researchers . determined to have originated in Slovakia. Mass killing: A suggested map of how the camp may have looked - there has never been an authentic layout of Sobibor, although Mr Haimi's research has uncovered new details .","Yoram Haimi's excavations have shed new light on the workings of the notorious camp, which was levelled by the Nazis in a bid to cover their tracks .

Two of Prince Harry’s most high-ranking personal protection officers watched him being photographed playing ‘strip billiards’ in his Las Vegas hotel suite but failed to take any action, it was confirmed yesterday. One made only a half-hearted attempt to remonstrate with a group of naked girls – whom the prince had only just met in a casino bar but still recklessly took to his room to cavort with until the early hours. The unidentified Scotland Yard detective took no further action and even allowed the drunken women to dress and then leave with their camera phones and undeleted snaps. Rumbled: Now in LA, this is thought to be the moment the prince learned the naked photos of him had been published . He was, claimed one source, ‘enjoying the party more than protecting the Prince from himself’. Within days the pictures had been sold to a US celebrity gossip website and broadcast around the world, causing intense embarrassment to the Royal Family. Two of the royal bodyguards are to be quizzed over accusations that they did not do enough to stop the pictures being taken. Scotland Yard officially refused to comment but Metropolitan Police Commissioner Bernard Hogan-Howe is understood to have asked to be personally briefed on the issue. Today Princess Diana’s former royalty protection officer Ken Wharfe said: 'The moment you invite unknown people into your hotel room there is a question of invasion of privacy and as far as security is concerned it is potentially dangerous. 'If one of these girls had planted drugs or had a knife rather than taken pictures then the officers would be in serious trouble. There should have been better security. 'I always questioned the practice of sending the less experienced protection officers with the younger royals. I think it should be the other way round.' What happens in Vegas... doesn't stay in Vegas: The party-loving royal was enjoying himself - but it is unclear as to what sort of reaction he will face on his return home . Although millions have already viewed the photographs on the internet – indeed ‘Prince Harry, naked’ is one of the most used phrases on search engines and the images are easy to find – the British media are still prevented from using them after St James’s Palace claimed they were an ‘invasion of the prince’s privacy’. However The Sun newspaper has decided to publish them after receiving what is believed to be a first-hand account of the night from a girl who was present in the room. Further details of the prince’s sleazy antics on Friday last week were already emerging yesterday. The Mail has been told that within minutes of checking into his suite on the 63rd floor of the five-star Wynn Encore Hotel through a private lobby, Harry and two of his friends were out on the town. The group started their night at the SW Steakhouse before returning via a private lift to their suite to change. The prince and his protection officers . then made their way to the Wynn’s Surrender nightclub, set around a . pool and featuring go-go dancers gyrating on stripper poles to the . sounds of thudding house music. Mingling with the crowds are dozens of prostitutes, a common sight in Sin City, openly approaching single men. Calm before the storm: aPrince Harry (centre) relaxed with his friend Tom Inskip (right) Harry . and his friends took over a two-storey cabana – an enclosure by the . pool – closest to the private exit to his suite where they downed . jaegerbombs  – potent alcoholic drinks. He stayed chatting to his friends and a group of girls from about 1am until 3.30am on Saturday before returning to the suite. The Mail was told early yesterday that two of Harry’s taxpayer-funded, round-the-clock police protection officers were with him when the pictures of him naked were taken. This was later confirmed by website TMZ which broke the story after being sold the pictures. It said yesterday: ‘The night of the naked Vegas hotel party, Harry was hanging with two male friends...after some boozing, the group decided to bring a bunch of chicks they had just met back to Harry’s VIP suite at Encore. ‘That’s when Harry’s people dropped the ball. ‘When the girls entered the room, we’re told the ladies were NOT asked to surrender their phones...an epic failure considering Harry’s well-documented wild side. ‘As the party fired up, several girls began to snap pics on their cell-phones …and one of Harry’s minders lackadaisically told the women, “awww, come on…no photos”. ‘Sources who were there tell TMZ the minders were asleep at the wheel, enjoying the party more than protecting the Prince from himself. ‘After more boozing, the clothes came off…and more photos were taken, in plain view of the handlers, yet Harry’s people did nothing.’ The website added: ‘TMZ spoke with . several people in the Las Vegas VIP scene who tell us they see . situations like this every day and it could have been easily contained, . but as one source put it, “Harry’s team acted like a bunch of . amateurs”.’ Hours later at . least one of Harry’s police protection officers was also photographed . with him wearing a straw hat and swimming trunks in a Jacuzzi at a . raucous ‘pool party’ at the nearby MGM Grand hotel. One British newspaper decided to publish the pictures going against the wishes of the palace . In a statement St James's Palace said: 'Newspapers regulate themselves, so . the publication of the photographs is ultimately a decision for editors . to make' On . his first full day back in the country after the scandal broke, the . Queen’s grandson was keeping a low profile yesterday and ordered his . advisers not to discuss the incident or reveal his whereabouts. He is still officially on holiday until next week, when he is due to report for duty as an Apache attack helicopter pilot, and has no planned public engagements until an appearance at the Paralympics at the beginning of September. But well-placed sources have told the Mail that Harry drove to Clarence House, his father’s London base, on Tuesday afternoon shortly after touching down at Heathrow from Los Angeles. He immediately went in to see his . Private Secretary, Jamie Lowther-Pinkerton. They remained in Mr . Lowther-Pinkerton’s office for around 45 minutes discussing how to . handle the fall-out from the pictures. It . was around this time that instructions were given to Prince Charles’s . personal lawyers, Harbottle and Lewis who went to the Press Complaints . Commission to ensure British newspapers could not publish the . photographs that had already been viewed by millions on the internet. Sir . Christopher Meyer, who chaired the PCC between 2003 and 2009, said that . it was unclear whether the prince’s privacy had in fact been breached. He . told The Times: ‘You could argue, “Sure, it’s a private place, it’s his . room”, but if he invites a bunch of strangers to his room, is his . privacy already violated?’ Meanwhile, . questions were continuing to be asked how the Metropolitan Police could . have allowed the incident to get so out of control. Moment of realisation? Harry arrived in Los Angeles just an hour after the photos surfaced on the internet and spent much of his time on his mobile phone suggesting that the news had been broken to him . Explaining himself? The young prince was on holiday after an exemplary performance as an Olympics ambassador - but his good work might unravel after the publication of photos of his antics . Tense: In blue shirt, cream panama hat and sunglasses, the prince looked apprehensive as he waited outside a restaurant in trendy Venice Beach . Metropolitan . Police Commissioner Bernard Hogan-Howe has dismissed the furore, saying . of his officers: ‘They are there to protect him for security reasons, . not regulate his life.’ But . his casual attitude has infuriated Dai Davies, the former head of .

Grim Discovery: Evidence of the attack was found Friday afternoon by a trio of hikers, who came upon a lone backpack lying near a park river . A hiker in Alaska's Denali National Park photographed a grizzly bear for at least eight minutes before the bear mauled and killed him in the first fatal attack in the park's history, officials said Saturday. Investigators have recovered the camera and looked at the photographs, which show the bear grazing and not acting aggressively before the attack, Denali Park Superintendent Paul Anderson said. A state trooper shot and killed the bear . on Saturday, and investigators will examine its stomach contents and use . other tests to confirm it's the animal that killed the hiker. The hiker was backpacking alone along the Toklat River on Friday afternoon when he came within 50 yards of the bear, far closer than the quarter-mile of separation required by park rules, officials said. 'They show the bear grazing in the willows, not acting aggressive in any form or manner during that period of time,' Anderson said. Investigators have identified the man but won't release his name until they've notified his family. They said he's a U.S. citizen but declined to release any other information about him. A Fateful Search: Park officials launched a rescue helicopter around 8 p.m. Friday, or about two-and-one-half hours after the hikers came upon the lone backpack . Eerie Sighting: Rangers saw at least one bear as they hovered above the site in the helicopter. The lone bear reportedly scurried away moments later . Rangers were hoping to recover his . remains later Saturday after ensuring the scene was safe. Several other . bears have been seen in the area. Officials learned of the attack after . hikers stumbled upon an abandoned backpack along the river about three . miles from a rest area on Friday afternoon. The hikers also spotted torn . clothing and blood. They immediately hiked back and alerted staff park. Rangers in a helicopter spotted a . large male grizzly bear sitting on the hiker's remains, which they . called a ""food cache"" in the underbrush about 100 to 150 yards from the . site of the attack on Friday. Empty-handed: After rangers from the park most famous for Mt. McKinley (pictured) discovered the backpack, they were forced to return empty-handed because of nightfall . There's no indication that the man's . death was the result of anything other than a bear attack, investigators . said, adding that it's the first known fatal mauling in the park's . nearly century-long history. 'Over the years, and especially since . the 1970s, the park has worked very diligently to minimize the conflict . between humans and wildlife in the park,' Anderson said. 'Over the years, and especially since . the 1970s, the park has worked very diligently to minimize the conflict . between humans and wildlife in the park.'

Park officials said they don't believe . other registered backpackers are in the immediate area. That portion of . the park is closed but other wilderness areas remain open, officials . said. A wallet was later found near the site of the attack with probable identification. However, officials are yet to name the unfortunate hiker, as they work to identify the next of kin . Prior to receiving a permit to hike in . the area, all backpackers in the park receive mandatory bear awareness . training that teaches them to stay at least a quarter-mile away from . bears, and to slowly back away if they find themselves any closer.

The Royal Family put on a show of force yesterday after one of their most publicly disastrous weeks in recent years. The Queen attended church near Balmoral with Prince Philip and other senior royals including Prince Charles, Princess Anne and Prince Edward. But although Charles might have been praying for divine intervention to keep his son on the straight and narrow, he was not accompanied by Prince Harry with whom he has been spending the weekend.

Archbishop Desmond Tutu has pulled out of a summit because he refused to share a platform with Tony Blair. The Nobel Peace Prize winner said it would be ‘inappropriate’ for him to attend the event in South Africa tomorrow due to Mr Blair’s ‘morally indefensible’ support for the Iraq war. The withdrawal comes as local Muslim party Al Jama-ah threatened to arrest the former Prime Minister for ‘crimes against humanity’ over his involvement in the 2003 invasion.

In this context, it would be inappropriate and untenable for the archbishop to share a platform with Mr Blair.’ Mr Blair was due to attend the Discovery Invest Leadership Summit along with chess grandmaster and opposition Russian politician Garry Kasparov, and former Tesco chief executive Sir Terry Leahy. A spokesman for the former Prime Minister said: ‘Obviously Tony Blair is sorry that the Archbishop has decided to pull out now from an event that has been fixed for months and where he and the Archbishop were never actually sharing a platform,’ he said.

Stephen Williams, 33, admitted the attack after one of the girls picked him out at an identity parade. He admitted to using heroin earlier in the day . A terrified teenager was saved by a Westlife programme she used to shield herself when a brutal robber stabbed her up to six times on her way from a concert. The 15-year-old was viciously struck in the chest, abdomen and wrist with a 9inch kitchen knife after she was followed into an alleyway by heroin user Stephen Williams. The schoolgirl, who cannot be named for legal reasons, was attacked late at night in Norwich after she had been to see Irish boy band Westlife, at the O2 in London on May 12. She pulled the concert programme from her bag which helped to cushion the impact of the frenzied assault, stopping her from being more critically injured or even killed. Williams, 33, of Norwich, was jailed for seven years and four months at Norwich Crown Court yesterday after admitting robbery at an earlier hearing. Detective Constable Graham Finney said after the case: ‘The victim’s injuries could have been a lot worse had she not instinctively protected herself using the concert programme. ‘One shudders to think what would have happened if that hadn’t been between her and the knife. ‘She was very lucky.’ The court heard that the music fan and her friend, a woman aged 20, had returned to Norwich together after the concert at about 2.20am on May 13 this year. Ben Brighouse, prosecuting, said they had met two men on the coach who walked some of the way home with them but they parted at Norwich Playhouse. He said the two began to walk home down an alleyway, unaware that they were being followed, when they heard Williams shout ‘give me all your bags’. He said: ‘They saw him running at them at speed. He was holding a large kitchen knife.’ The terror-stricken 15-year-old desperately tried to give her bag to Williams but could not get it off her shoulder. He stabbed her in the body about five to six times and waved the knife around over her even after she had slumped to the ground. One of the three puncture holes made in the programme by the knife is visible in the bottom right corner . The 9inch knife which was used to stab the girl up to six times in the brutal attack . Williams picked up the shoulder bag, which contained just a bottle of coke and make-up, and fled. Mr Brighouse said a white carrier bag containing a Westlife programme was later found to have three knife holes in it after helping to ward off the savage blows. The seriously-injured schoolgirl was rushed to hospital where doctors treated a 5cm wound to the right side of her chest to the depth of her rib, a 5cm incision to the right side of her abdomen above the liver and a 3cm by 7cm wound to the right wrist. Williams, who confessed after he was picked out by one of the girls at an identity parade, told the court he had taken heroin during the day before arming himself with a knife from his kitchen . He was sat on park bench when he the two girls walk past and stalked them. Mr Brighouse said both girls, who were ‘slight and petite’, showed a ‘great deal of courage’ in helping to bring Williams to justice. Katherine Moore, defending, said her . client suffers from a degenerative condition which causes significant . pain and has led to him taking street drugs which has underpinned his . ‘criminality to date’. The schoolgirl was returning from a Westlife concert in London when she was attacked. She was saved by using the programme she had bought as a shield . He was jailed for seven years and four months with an extension of three years to the period he must remain on licence. Recorder Alexander Milne said the attack was the ‘top category of street robbery’. He added: ‘The fact that no major organ, artery or tendon were damaged was a matter purely of good luck, nothing more than that’. Last night Detective Constable Finney, of Norwich CID, backed his jail sentence. Detective Constable Finney, who investigated the case, said: ‘This was an extremely traumatic experience for the young teenage victim who only hours before had been enjoying a pop concert in London. ‘Williams committed this offence with no concern for his victim. ‘The fact he has pleaded guilty demonstrates the strength of the prosecution case against him. ‘It also means the victim will not be forced to relive the horror of the attack giving evidence in a trial.’","Attack took place in Norwich after the young girl returned from Westlife concert in London .

Much more than a bag: Judge Zoe Smith told the bag snatcher in court that the crime was not just inconvenient but caused fear as well . To the thief who snatched it, it was just a handbag. But to his victim, the bag was a source of security and peace of mind, without which she was unable even to feel safe in her own home, a woman judge told a defendant in court. Crown court judge Zoe Smith was incensed after Kamran Latif suggested that he had merely ‘inconvenienced’ women when he stole their bags. Judge Smith, who has more than 40 . years of courtroom experience, brought a sentencing hearing to a virtual . standstill as she scolded the defendant, telling the courtroom that men . simply did not understand the real impact of such a theft. Without her handbag, a woman  is robbed of her security and ability  to get home safely, the senior  judge said. Even once she gets home she cannot feel safe because of the fear that a stranger has her house keys, the judge added. She . told Reading Crown Court last Monday: ‘It is not just inconvenience, it . causes fear as well. Her phone is taken, her cards, her money to get a . cab is taken, her keys to the door of her house. 'Stealing a woman's bag isn't just an inconvenience... There's the fear of someone breaking into her house.' Judge Zoe Smith . ‘Then there is the fear of anyone coming to break into the house. ‘It’s a terrible thing to do and girls are left stranded on their own.’ Latif had admitted stealing two handbags from women, snatching the bags in town centre bars and cafes. One of his victims, Hannah Williams, wrote to the court about the impact of the theft, saying it had ‘caused her great upset’. In her written statement, she said: ‘When I want to go out and have no money, I don’t go out stealing.’ Latif, 34, from Reading, also pleaded . guilty to the theft of alcohol worth £155 from a supermarket, and . driving away from a petrol station without paying for fuel worth £20. Robbed of her security: Victim Hannah Williams did not feel safe even at home for fear that a stranger has her keys since defendant Kamran Latif mugged her . He asked for 38 similar offences to be taken into consideration. Lisa Goddard, prosecuting, said he pleaded guilty to the offences on June 20 this year. But on the same day he stole another handbag in a café, and struck again in a nearby shop the next day. The former drug abuser had a history of other offences dating back to 1996 and was previously jailed for burglary and importing drugs. Edward Culver, defending, said his client had managed ‘a degree of abstinence’ from drugs since getting married in 2008.  He asked the judge to spare him a jail sentence and said he had a supportive family. Hearing to standstill: Judge Smith told the hearing at Reading Crown Court that Latif will get a substantial sentence . But Judge Smith said Latif had probably used the same argument when he pleaded guilty and asked for bail, before going straight out and committing more offences. She said: ‘No doubt he said in his bail application he had a supportive family and that he was going to behave himself.’ She postponed the sentencing until December and allowed Latif to remain on bail until then. But she warned him that he must get a job to find the money to compensate his victims, and stay crime and drug-free. Any criminal offences would result in an immediate jail sentence, she said. ‘It will be a substantial sentence,’ the judge added.","Judge Zoe Smith tells bag snatcher in court that the crime is more than just inconvenient to his victims .

Her father James Brigham, the city's former budget chief, was reportedly so concerned about her well-being following the collapse of her year-long marriage that he had flown in from St Louis to take his distraught daughter to a rehab facility. He was believed to have spoken to her after landing at La Guardia airport at 9.30am on Monday and had planned to meet his daughter for lunch. Before their estrangement: Carlisle Brigham and Anthony Champalimaud pose together. Ms Brigham died after what appears to be a tragic accident on the stairwell of the Manhattan apartment she was staying at . Ms Brigham was discovered, dressed all in white, lying in a pool of blood just before 11 am on Monday at the bottom of a treacherously steep stairwell in the Lower East Side. The severity of her injuries made investigators initially believe she had been . murdered. However, the New York City Chief Medical . examiner ruled that Ms Brigham, whose father is now the chairman of a St Louis investment bank, died in a tragic 'freak accident' after suffering blunt trauma to her head and neck. Initial autopsy results were unclear whether alcohol may have played a role in her death. According to the New York Post, the night before her death, Ms Brigham had returned from a  wedding in Washington D.C. and gone to Sixth Ward, a bar next door to the apartment where she had been staying. Attending the wedding was difficult for her, her father told the New York Times, coming a week after her first wedding anniversary.

'She did not look like she was homeless or a hooker,' the resident, who is also a medic, told The Local East Village reporter. 'She had too many accouterments of the average American young person in her 20s: An iPhone and wallet full of plastic. 'She had compound fractures in her arm and she was cut.' Her death was confirmed by former Mayor Ed Koch, who worked with her father James Brigham Jr. from 1978 to 1981. 'They are wonderful people. She was absolutely extraordinarily beautiful.

After photographs of her shapely figure at the Royal Wedding gained worldwide attention, few can blame Pippa Middleton for making the most of her enviable looks. And the cover of her eagerly awaited book about party planning is unlikely to leave her legion of male fans feeling disappointed - her picture appears no fewer than four times. Miss Middleton is shown in a range of saccharine poses on the front and back of her debut book, entitled Celebrate: A Year of Festivities for Families and Friends. Not camera shy: Pippa Middleton is pictured no fewer than four times on the front (left) and back (right) cover of her eagerly awaited book, Celebrate: A Year of Festivities for Families and Friends . In one picture, she is seen playing frisbee on the beach. Others include a scene of her helping a little girl to cook. Billed as a 'comprehensive seasonal guide to simple and creative entertaining', it is a book which Miss Middleton hopes will cement her credentials as a party planner, and industry observers believe it could net her a small fortune in the process. The cover's patchwork quilt-style design may come as a surprise to some readers, however, as Miss Middleton has strongly defended her right to privacy in recent years. Newspapers have given an undertaking that they will not use paparazzi photographs of her because of her request to remain largely out of the public gaze. Famous face: Pippa Middleton has gained worldwide notoriety since the Royal Wedding last year, but she has asked that her privacy is respected . Whether Miss Middleton will be able . to maintain her position that she is a private citizen following the . book's release remains to be seen. Her . first tome is expected to generate much publicity, and it was reported . last month that she has negotiated a six-figure book deal with . publishers Michael Joseph, the branch of the Penguin Group that deals . with ‘highly commercial’ properties. Miss . Middleton is also frequently seen at public events. Only nine days ago, . she attended a launch for adventurer and presenter Ben Fogle's new . book, The Accidental Naturalist. Miss Middleton has insisted on . writing the book, described as a cross between a party planning bible, . entertainment guide and recipe book, herself. Phenomenon: Photographs of Miss Middleton's enviable figure were viewed across the globe after her sister Kate's wedding to Prince William . Rubbing shoulders: Pippa Middleton with Prince Harry on the balcony of Buckingham Palace after the Royal Wedding. Miss Middleton's book deal has led to accusations that she has cashed in on her Royal connections . It is already available for ordering on retail website Amazon ahead of its October 25 release date.The book was originally priced at £25, but can now be bought for £16.77. However, Miss Middleton's book deal has attracted criticism, with some observers accusing her of cashing in on her sister Kate's position as a senior Royal. Similar accusations have been levelled at the Middletons' family business, Party Pieces, which shortly before the Royal Wedding produced a range of paper plates, platters, bowls and napkins emblazoned with crowns, crests and coats of arms. Kate and Pippa's parents, Carole and Mike Middleton, were eager to avoid being seen as cashing in on the wedding, but their business was inevitably boosted by the publicity surrounding the occasion. The number of visitors to the company's website quadrupled after the wedding. Advantageous: Carole and Mike Middleton have been eager to avoid being seen as cashing in on their Royal connections.

Yahoo has fired its Washington bureau chief after he was caught on a live webcast saying Mitt Romney was 'happy to have a party with black people drowning.' David Chalian's controversial remarks about the Republican presidential candidate and his wife, Ann, were heard during an ABC News/Yahoo News webcast of the Republican National Convention in Tampa, Florida. The comments were flagged up by conservative news watchdog NewsBusters this morning. 'They're not concerned at all,' Chalian said on the broadcast, clearly unaware that the quip was being recorded and going out live. 'They're happy to have a party with black people drowning.' Referring to Hurricane Isaac, which is battering towns in Mississippi, Alabama and Louisiana, Chalian is heard making the anti-Romney joke to a colleague identified as 'John.' In a statement issued after lunch, Yahoo! News confirmed the reporter had been let go. The company added that it had apologised to camp Romney for the 'inappropriate' remarks. 'David Chalian's statement was inappropriate and does not represent the views of Yahoo!,' a spokesman said. 'He has been terminated effective immediately. SCROLL DOWN FOR AUDIO . Yahoo: The company quickly sacked Chalian after his comments were flagged up by NewsBuster today . 'We have already reached out to the . Romney campaign, and we apologize to Mitt Romney, his staff, their . supporters and anyone who was offended.' The Republican National Convention was delayed a day as a result of Hurricane Isaac. NewsBusters, which tasks itself with . 'exposing and combating liberal media bias,' was quick to point out that President . Barack Obama did not cancel any of his scheduled campaign-fundraising . parties on Monday night. In a statement this afternoon, Chalian apologised for his 'inappropriate and thoughtless joke.' 'I am profoundly sorry for making an inappropriate and thoughtless joke. I was commenting on the challenge of staging a convention during a hurricane and about campaign optics. I have apologized to the Romney campaign, and I want to take this opportunity to publicly apologize to Gov. and Mrs. Romney.' 'Not concerned': Chalian was overheard saying the Mitt and Ann Romney, pictured yesterday, were unfazed by African Americans suffering in Hurricane Isaac . The reporter also said he regrets . causing any distraction from the 'exceptional coverage' of the . Republican convention by Yahoo News and ABC News. Chalian's gaff wasn't the first time race has been brought into the spotlight during the GOP convention. Yesterday afternoon a man was ejected from the event after throwing peanuts at a black camerawoman and shouting 'this is how we feed animals.' Republicans fear the alleged racist incident, which took place at the Tampa Bay Times Forum, will further dent the party's support among African Americans ahead of the presidential election. At least one poll has shown Romney has less than one per cent support among black voters. The peanut onslaught -- reported to have been on a CNN camerawoman -- led to a furious response on Twitter. Until today, David Chalian was responsible for directing Washington coverage across all broadcast and digital platforms for Yahoo! News. He previously served as the political editor for PBS NewsHour, managing the editorial content from the NewsHour's congressional, White House, and Supreme Court beats. He also served as an on-camera political analyst, appearing in regular political webcasts on the Online NewsHour. Before he joined NewsHour, the journalist was the political director for ABC News. The role saw him oversee the editorial content of all political news across ABC News' broadcasts and platforms. Chalian created and co-anchored 'Top Line,' a daily political webcast on ABCNews.com and on ABC News Now, the network's 24-hour digital outlet. In addition, he provided political commentary and analysis for 'World News with Diane Sawyer,' 'Good Morning America,' 'Nightline' and ABC News Radio.

"By . Rick Dewsbury . PUBLISHED: . 05:21 EST, 30 August 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 05:21 EST, 30 August 2012 . Shamed cyclist Lance Armstrong shows he has strong support after his doping scandal - as he's mobbed by hundreds of fans while out jogging. The former champion - hit with a lifetime ban for drugs cheating - went for a run in his trademark yellow top in Mount Royal Park, Montreal, yesterday. Armstrong, 40, was cheered by fans who clamoured for his autograph after he used social networks to invite them to join him. The jog came moments after a speech at a cancer conference in which he defiantly introduced himself as a seven-time Tour de France - despite having the victories stripped. Defiant: Lance Armstrong salutes to cheering fans in Montreal yesterday after they turn up to show their support in the wake of his doping scandal . 'My name is Lance Armstrong. I am a cancer survivor,' he said to open his speech to the World Cancer Congress. 'I'm a father of five. And yes, I won the Tour de France seven times.' Armstrong announced last week he would no longer challenge the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency's drug charges against him. USADA threw out his competitive victories dating to 1998, which would include all seven Tour wins. Armstrong, who has maintained his innocence, focused on his experience as a cancer survivor and the work of his charitable foundation. He said he struggled to get enough information following his diagnosis in 1996. 'After I left the doctor's office, I was grabbing every pamphlet and flyer I could off the wall,' he said. 'You know what we did after that? We went to the bookstore - remember those things.' Victory: Armstrong makes V signs with his fingers, after earlier introducing himself as seven times Tour de France champion, despite being stripped of the prestigious title . The former champion cyclist, who made the sport popular in the U.S., signs autographs for fans still standing by him amidst the doping charges . Armstrong wears his trademark Livestrong cap and yellow top, which have become a sign of his fightback from cancer to become a dominant cycling champion . Armstrong will not contest the doping charges and accepted a life time ban, but he claims he is innocent. Judging by the show of support, his fans have a similar view . Armstrong also announced his foundation would donate an additional $500,000 to a joint initiative aimed at increasing access to cancer care around the world. Armstrong briefly returned to the doping scandal at the end of his remarks, vowing it wouldn't impact his charitable work. 'I think the real issue here is one of distraction,' he said. 'I'm going to tell this to you all as if you're friends and partners and allies. I'm not going to be distracted from this fight.' Earlier this month U.S. anti-doping officials stripped the sports icon of his titles. The announcement from the US Anti-Doping Agency effectively destroyed his legacy as one of the greatest cyclists in history and rubs a black smudge on a story that inspired millions of fans, drawn to his story of returning to glory after recovering from horrific cancer. The USADA acted within an hour of Armstrong's announcement that he would stop fighting charges that he used blood doping to illegitimately enhance his performance. Despite the action, Armstrong maintains his innocence and called the USADA's case a 'witch hunt.' Loyal: Fans who received Armstrong's invitation on social networks to join him for a jog hold out pictures of him in his prime to be signed . A smiling young girl shows off her bicycle t-shirt as she speaks with the disgraced cyclist, but the complexities of the arguments behind the decision on the use of banned substances are beyond her . Moving on: Having already retired from professional cycling a year ago after a criminal investigation into the use of performace boosting drugs, the sporting future for Armstrong is unclear . Armstrong, who retired a year ago, is now officially a drug cheat in the eyes of his nation's doping agency. USADA chief executive Travis Tygart said earlier that the agency has the authority to remove the titles from the 40-year-old athlete - and would act promptly to do so. Armstrong argued that only the International Cycling Union, which oversees the Tour de France, has that power. 'USADA cannot assert control of a professional international sport and attempt to strip my seven Tour de France titles,' he said in a statement. 'I know who won those seven Tours, my teammates know who won those seven Tours, and everyone I competed against knows who won those seven Tours.' USADA maintains that Armstrong has used banned substances as far back as 1996, including the blood-booster EPO and steroids as well as blood transfusions -- all to boost his performance. 'It is a sad day for all of us who love sport and athletes,' Mr Tygart said. 'It's a heartbreaking example of win at all costs overtaking the fair and safe option. There's no success in cheating to win.' Armstrong declined to enter arbitration - his last option - because he said he was weary of fighting accusations that have dogged him for years. He has consistently pointed to the hundreds of drug tests that he has passed as proof he was clean. Dominant: Armstrong celebrates crossing the finish line as he wins one of seven Tour de France titles between 1999 and 2005 . Family: Lance Armstrong had a fourth child, Max, in 2010 with his girlfriend Anna Hansen, even though he thought he was sterile because of the cancer . Armstrong's disgrace marks the dizzying fall of an athlete who was regarded as a hero by millions because of his remarkable recovery from testicular cancer. His foundation has raised some $500million through the sale of iconic 'Livestrong' bracelets, which were seemingly ubiquitous during Armstrong's heyday. Although he had already been crowned a world champion and won individual stages at the Tour de France, Armstrong was still relatively unknown in the US until he won the epic race for the first time in 1999. It was the ultimate comeback tale: When diagnosed with cancer, doctors had given him less than a 50 percent chance of survival before surgery and brutal cycles of chemotherapy saved his life. He was diagnosed with cancer in October 1996 and surgeons removed a tumor-ridden testicle during an emergency operation, though the tumors had spread to his lungs, abdomen and brain. Over the course of two months, he underwent extensive chemotherapy and surgery to combat the cancer. Comeback: Armstrong was given a 40 percent chance of survival after he was diagnosed with testicular cancer. He fought back to be a better cyclist than ever before . By January 1998 - one year after his chemotherapy ended - he was back on the bike and aggressively training. Before his cancer, he had won several stages of the Tour de France in past years, but he attacked the race aggressively - with new passion. He forged a reputation for himself as a brutal competitor, forcing himself through grueling offseason workouts no one else could match, then crushing his rivals in the Alps and the Pyrenees during the Tour. His dominance of the Tour de France elevated the sport's popularity in America to unprecedented levels. His story and success enabled him to enlist lawmakers and global policymakers to promote cancer awareness and research. His Lance Armstrong Foundation has raised nearly $500 million since its founding in 1997. Armstrong walked away from the sport in 2011 without being charged following a two-year federal criminal investigation into many of the same accusations he faces from USADA.","Two hundred fans turn up in support after he is banned from cycling for life .

She sent the stream of explicit notes from her work account at University College London Hospital, and her employers found out and dismissed her. The manager, who cannot be named for legal reasons, is claiming unfair dismissal and sex discrimination, despite sending emails about masturbating and even having a ‘treasure hunt’ on her breasts. Sacked: University College Hospital London, pictured, sacked the woman after discovering the string of explicit emails sent from her work account . Sam Nicholls, for UCLH, said her actions were completely inappropriate, telling the tribunal: 'The emails talk of sex in what I would describe as extreme . language. It is shocking. This is not a building site culture but this . is a refined culture of an NHS trust. 'It’s not an invitation to coffee. It’s not an invitation for . dinner, it’s not even ‘I love you’ - it goes far beyond that.' The woman admitted the affair and emails to her boss last July after the man’s scorned wife threatened to turn up at UCLH for an angry showdown. During a flurry of emails sent between her and the man on April 14 last year the woman suggested a boozy tryst in her office, saying: 'Want to meet? I’m very drunk. My office. Boss’s desk.' Earlier on she had told the man of what she had spent the evening talking about, including ‘my attraction... my unhappiness and how to make a love affair last forever.’ She then added: ‘And on second bottle. And already missing you. And already drunk.’ Another foul-mouthed message sent by the woman two days later unleashed a tirade of abuse against an unidentified person, who she described as a ‘Complete f****** w***** of a t*** pot c*** of a b******.’ She sent an email to the man on May 4 last year saying : “I’m so tempted to call you and have a conversation about w******, stockings and breasts.' 'Extreme': The woman, who can't be named for legal reasons, sent the notes on the night she feared her lover's wife might confront her . In other messages sent the same evening she talked of how ‘I want to be a bloke clearly!’ to which her lover replied ‘It is great having a penis.’ This prompted the woman to fire off another pair of raunchy emails. In one she said: 'Must be great to w*** easily, wee standing up when out in a wood, and have something to play with when bored.' Ten minutes later she sent another email to the man saying: 'I am serious. I’ve decided that as I can make my own decisions, buy furniture and put it together [as long as it doesn’t have doors] and financially support myself, I have no need for a man at all - except physically. 'So if I get a Rabbit [sex toy], plus the skills to use it, I won’t need one at all. But seriously, a penis is so easy for self-pleasuring - you are lucky. I’d do it all the time if I was you.' The pair returned to the sex chat a fortnight later and indulged in a conversation about playing an x-rated ‘treasure hunt.’ It began after the woman sent an email on June 17 last year saying: 'I am now up and heading out. Been looking at my breasts for a while. Not sure about them with the tan line. (I bet you have no idea what to say to that).' The man replied: 'I’m sure the tan line on your breasts will be fine. I assume you used my advice and wore the blue plasters over your nipples and that is your tan line. That would be great, it would be like a treasure hunt.' Soon after she sent an excited email saying: 'That’s so funny - X marks the spot! May need to put criss-cross blue plasters in another location if that works. “Certain” men need all the help they can get. 'Fancy playing pirates then?!' During closing submissions at Central London Employment Tribunal the woman said: 'No policy states that email use is gross misconduct. The policies on email are confusing in any event.' She also said she had been discriminated against for being a woman as her lover had not faced the same disciplinary procedure because he worked for a separate company. UCLH deny the claims. Judgement on the case has been reserved until a later date.","University College London Hospital saw the 'extreme' emails and sacked her .

At least five Los Angeles police officers are being investigated in connection to the death of a 35-year-old mother of two who was allegedly stomped and kicked in the genitals during an arrest last month, police said on Friday. Alesia Thomas was found not breathing in the back of a patrol car after resisting arrest in an incident that was captured on a dashboard camera. ‘I take all in-custody death investigations very seriously and directed the officers involved be removed from field duties until further details are known, including what part intoxicants and physical conditions contributed,’ LAPD Chief Charlie Beck said. ‘I’m confident we will get to the truth, no matter where that leads us.’ Scroll down to hear from LAPD . Tragic: Alesia Thomas, a 35-year-old mother of two, died in police custody after being allegedly stomped on and kicked by officers . The incident took place on the morning of July 22 after two children aged three and 12 were abandoned at the LAPD’s Southeast Station, police said, according to the Los Angeles Times. Commander Bob Green, who is in charge of the Southeast Area station, told the Los Angeles Times that Thomas tried to surrender custody of the children to police because she was a drug addict and felt she could not care for them . Following an investigation, officers had determined that Thomas was the kids’ mother. Officials arrived at her home in the 9000 block of South Broadway and briefly questioned her, after which they proceeded to arrest her on suspicion of child endangerment. According to police and eyewitnesses, the 35-year-old, who was described as a large woman, began ‘actively resisting arrest.’ In an effort to subdue her, one of the officers performed a leg sweep and knocked her off her feet, while two others handcuffed Thomas behind her back, the LAPD said. According to KTLA, one of the cops told Thomas, ‘get your fat a** in the car.’ A female officer then threatened to kick her in the genitals and then made good on her threat, Commander Green later confirmed. Scene: Officers tracked Thomas to her home on South Broadway after she had abandoned her two children at a police station . The official account, however, made no mention of the female officer's questionable treatment of Thomas. The still struggling woman was placed into the back of a patrol car. Officers then reportedly tied her ankles with a strap known as a ‘hobble restrained device’ and propped her up into a seating position. A dashboard camera video reportedly shows the woman breathing shallowly before drawing her last breath. Last breath: Thomas was restrained and placed in the back of a police car, where she stopped breathing . A few minutes later, the officers noticed that the mother of two stopped breathing and called for Los Angeles Fire Department paramedics. Thomas was rushed to a hospital, where she died shortly after. It is unclear whether the cops . attempted to resuscitate her and how much time elapsed before first . responders arrived on the scene. Neighbor Gerald McCrary Sr said he did not see the arresting officers mistreat Thomas, and described her as being aggressive. The cops attempted to calm the woman . down and even brought her a glass of water, but Thomas was thrashing . about and even broke free from a pair of plastic handcuffs, according to . McCrary. ‘My heart hurts. I can't walk anymore,’ he recalled Thomas telling police. The . neighbour said the woman was shaking her head against the seat . inside the police car. Shortly after, McCrary saw Thomas lying on the . sidewalk without her shirt. The LAPD is planning to hold a press conference on Saturday, and may release the dashboard camera video that captured the incident. Attack: Michelle Jordan, 34, shows off her injuries after she was allegedly repeatedly thrown to the floor by LAPD officers after she was pulled over for talking on her mobile phone while driving . 'Brutal': A surveillance camera catches the officers throwing her to the ground as she gets out of her car . The revelations come just days after the release of a shocking video that shows two Los Angeles police officers body-slamming Michelle Jordan, a 34-year-old mother and registered nurse, for talking on her cell phone. The brutal arrest was captured by a surveillance camera after the officers followed her car into a Del Taco restaurant parking lot in the Tujunga area on August 11. Both officers - one with 22 years of service, the other a probationary officer with 10 months experience - have been placed on administrative leave pending an investigation. Witness: Raymond Branch said, although the woman should have been arrested, they went 'overboard' Earlier this month, 20-year-old skateboarder Ronald Weekley Jr. was tackled and pinned to the ground outside his Venice home, in an arrest that was caught on a mobile phone. An internal investigation has been launched into the arrest. On Monday, Deutsche Bank executive Brian Mulligan filed a $50 million lawsuit against the department, claiming two officers held him captive and beat him on May 15.","Alesia Thomas, 35, was arrested on July 22 for leaving her children at a police station .

X-Factor: Paul Ryan told a national radio show host last month that he had once burned up the marathon track in less than three hours . Paul Ryan has been forced into a humiliating U-turn over claims he was an unusually fast long-distance runner. A red-faced Ryan admitted on Saturday he didn't run a marathon in under three hours, as he boasted last month on a nationally broadcast radio interview. The conservative congressman acknowledged he misstated his time by more than an hour. It turns out the GOP V.P. hopeful conveniently rounded his time down - to three hours - instead of up - to four hours. The only problem is someone was, indeed, keeping track of this track feat. The Wisconsinite only corrected the record after Runner's World magazine unearthed evidence he had completed a single marathon in 1990, and finished in just over four hours. That time stands in stark contrast to . what Ryan had previously said, when he proudly bragged to radio host . Hugh Hewitt that he had run a 'two hour and fifty-something' marathon. That would make for a pace of less than 7 minutes per mile for the 26.2 mile course - a blazing speed for recreational runners. Back-tracking: A red-faced Ryan admitted Saturday that had rounded his time down to about three hours instead of the mark he actually recorded, which is closer to four . 'Under three, high twos. I had a two hour and fifty-something,' Ryan reportedly told Hewitt, to which the shocked radio-man expressed reportedly exclaimed, 'Holy smokes.' 'I was fast when I was younger, yeah,' Mitt Romney's running-mate quipped in reply. The Ryan campaign told Runner’s World magazine that the House Budget Chairman ran one marathon in 1990 when he was 20 years old. That was the Grandma’s Marathon in Duluth, Minnesota. The running magazine reports he finished in 4 hours, 1 minute, and 25 seconds. Ryan spokesman Brendan Buck provided ABC News with this statement from his boss: 'The race was more than 20 years ago, but my brother Tobin - who ran Boston last year- reminds me that he is the owner of the fastest marathon in the family and has never himself ran a sub-three. 'If I were to do any rounding, it would certainly be to four hours, not three. He gave me a good ribbing over this at dinner tonight.' ABC News asked Buck why Ryan made it sound as if he had run more than one marathon, but Buck only responded to confirm it was just a single race. It turns out Ryan is slower than Sarah Palin, but faster than Al Gore. Palin reportedly has a best time of 3:59; John Edwards has run 3:30 and George W. Bush has run 3:44, while Al Gore trails the vice presidential bunch with a 4:58.","GOP vice presidential hopeful misstated his mark by more than an hour .

As it got dark, the two got lost and . eventually headed for shore, beaching their kayaks in Huntington Bay, . nearly 10 miles east from where they had set out. The U.S. Coast Guard was patrolling the area, and heard Crowe call out to them from the shore around 10pm, Swieciki said.

'It was clear that morning in February . was a very cold, freezing morning,' said Mr Menary. 'The people inside . the address heard a noise and assumed it was the taxi so they left to go . home.

He asked Ward if Mr Worton was ok and Ward said: 'Yeah, sound . man, yeah' and said he was 'chilling'. But . the QC said: 'Edward Worton was far from sound. It was likely he was . already dead. He had multiple blows to the head and catastrophic . injuries, he was never going to get up and follow anyone.'

Ward later claimed he killed Mr Worton whilst . protecting his brother who had just been headbutted by the victim. But it emerged the killer had just six months before the attack been given a suspended jail term for violent disorder. In . a victim impact statement Mr Worton's girlfriend Michelle Bork, 29, said: . 'Eddie was my best friend and father of their six month old babies and . he was taken from them. 'Someone is going to have to explain to . those children when they're older what happened to their daddy and what . happened to the man who killed him.' The victim's sister . 'I feel like my heart has been . crushed. I used to be confident, outgoing and loving and always looking . forward to the future and I can no longer love life, He was our . protector, I now feel vulnerable'. In mitigation defence counsel Nigel . Power said: 'The defendant ended up losing control, fearing for what may . have happened to his brother. We submit that Mr Worton was an . individual who when angry was very strong and who was very difficult to . restrain.' But passing sentence Judge Michael Henshell told Ward: 'What happened was all out of proportion. He was your friend. 'You and your brother made no attempt to seek assistance and I have been driven to the conclusion that you knew he was lifeless when you left him. You called your solicitor a very considerable time later but never attempted to assist him.' Vincent was cleared of murder at an earlier hearing. In 2009 Mr Worton's father Ted, 52, a former miner, was battered with a mallet and then left to die during a party at his home in Ramsgate, Kent. The killer who left Ted lying in a pool of blood for almost two hours was cleared of murder but convicted of manslaughter and was jailed for ten years. It emerged he had been on licence at the time of the attack. Last month Eddie's family told of their disgust at Ward escaping a murder conviction. His mum Claire said: 'All we wanted was justice for Ed and now we feel let down. 'We're disgusted with what's happened and the outcome. We don't feel like we've been given justice as a family for the loss we suffered.' His sister Katie, 31, said: 'Someone is going to have to explain to those children when they're older what happened to their daddy and what happened to the man who killed him. 'Even if he gets the maximum sentence he could be out walking the streets in six or seven years. Ed's two children will only be seven and we'll be left to explain that to them.

Her memory loss was so bad that she completely forgot that her brother had died years earlier. Slater was jailed for nine years at Newcastle Crown Court after he pleaded guilty to grievous bodily harm. The court was told how Slater, then aged 18, had driven with his aunt and her two children to meet Miss Richard's then-partner, David Fiddler, over a dispute about drug payments. Fiddler had supplied cannabis to Slater and had claimed the defendant still owed him money for it. At around 7pm that night, Miss Richards along with her partner and her friend, were at a bus stop in Gateshead, when Slater, driving a small light blue car, approached them. The court heard how he approached the trio, swerving as he did, with a clear intention to hit Mr Fiddler.

Slater, who failed stop after the accident, was arrested later that same evening. He had been due to stand trial at Newcastle Crown Court but pleaded guilty to causing grievous bodily harm before the case started. Recorder Jonathan Sandiford said: 'What is clear to me is that once you were there you lost it. 'You drove that motor car towards him and you intended to use that car to cause him serious injury. 'You used a very dangerous weapon, that is what a motor car is. David Fiddler managed to get out of the way but Amanda Richards was not so fortunate. 'You didn't brake or swerve, you went right through her with that car and carried on driving and drove away. 'She suffered catastrophic injuries.' Slater often bought cannabis from Mr Fiddler, but there had been a dispute when he claimed the teenager still owed him £180 for a purchase, the court heard. Rupert Doswell, prosecuting, said: 'David Fiddler sent text messages to the defendant chasing him for the money. 'The defendant replied saying he didn't owe him any money, and there were some abusive messages by way of further response. 'Soon after, Mr Fiddler received a text message from another number claiming to be a police officer, saying to leave the defendant alone.'

His defence barrister, Jane Foley, said he was truly remorseful for causing the accident and was grateful she hadn't been killed. She added: 'He is a young man who has never been to prison before. The car was used as a weapon, but I invite you to consider there was a lack of pre-meditation. 'It was impulsive and it was opportunistic at the time. If he could turn back the hands of time, he would like to do it very much. 'It is a very upsetting and traumatic case.'

I was demanding to see my best friend. 'I couldn't remember some of my family - I even thought my niece had stolen my face, because she looks so much like me. 'The worst thing was that I couldn't remember that my brother was dead, so I was angry that my family wouldn't bring him to see me. 'My mum had to tell me all over again that he had died years ago.'

She added: 'I wouldn't be where I am today without Tom. He has pushed me to do things for myself, like getting the bus on my own. 'I feel very frustrated when I can't do things or remember things but things could be much worse, I could be in a wheelchair. 'I still don't feel I'm quite back to my normal self - all sorts of strange things have happened like my taste in food has changed.

Charged: Robert Gladden Jr., 15, faces 29 charges stemming from his shotgun attack at his Maryland high school . The 15-year-old student who walked into his Maryland high school and opened fire critically injuring a fellow student with Downs syndrome has been indicted on 29 different charges. Baltimore County prosecutors announced today that a grand jury has indicted Robert Wayne Gladden Jr. on nine counts of attempted murder, nine counts of first-degree assault and nine counts of reckless endangerment. He also faces two handgun charges. Police say Gladden fired two rounds from an antique shotgun at Perry Hall High School on first day of classes on August 27. One classmate, 17-year-old Daniel Borowy, was critically wounded after being shot in the back, and police believe that the boy was shot at random unrelated to his disability. The indictment names eight other potential victims, including guidance counselor Jesse Wasmer who tackled the shooter to the floor moments after he opened fire. Police and school officials called Wasmer a hero for wrestling the gun away from Gladden. The suspect posted to his Facebook profile before last Monday’s shooting, ‘First day of school, last day of my life. F*** the world.’ Gladden allegedly came to school that morning with a bottle of vodka, a disassembled shotgun and 21 rounds of ammunition. Scroll down for video .

After drinking the vodka, he stormed . into the school’s cafeteria shortly before 11am, pulled out a shotgun . and opened fire, said police. Borowy was in critical condition on Tuesday morning. Students at held a vigil for the victim this morning and have taken to Twitter to express their support for his quick recovery. Gladden, who was charged with first degree attempted murder the day after the incident, has a Facebook page littered with chilling references to killing. He lists Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold, the students who carried out the 1999 Columbine High School massacre where 13 people died, as ‘inspirational people.' Gladden also has a title of ‘Murder Suicide’ next to his name and has listed notorious murderers -The Manson Family - under his ‘Work and Education’ section. Chilling: Just hours before the shooting, alleged gunman Robert Gladden posted this ominous message to his Facebook page. The emoticon reportedly means '**** you' The student, who is being charged as an adult and also faces a second charge of first-degree assault, describes himself on Facebook as a 'metalhead.' ‘I’m a metalhead and that’s about it,' he has written in the 'Information' section. He lists heavy metal bands and musicians, including Marilyn Manson and Slipknot, as his favourite artists. Gladden's father has said that his son was bullied at school. Police have said Gladden took a shotgun, which was over 40 years old, and a bottle of vodka into the school. Terrifying: Suspected shooter Robert 'Bobby' Gladden is seen left; Guidance counsellor Jesse Wasmer, right, is being hailed a hero for grabbing the gunman - preventing a potential bloodbath . Gladden, who is being held without bail, has a preliminary hearing has been scheduled for September 7. After police searched Gladden's home yesterday, the student's stepfather, Andrew Piper, was arrested on charges unrelated to the shooting. Piper was charged with illegal possession of weapons and drugs at his home in the 8500-block of Bradshaw Road. Meanwhile, students and parents in the Maryland community are crediting a high school guidance counselor with saving the school after he heroically restrained the gunman before he could fire any fatal shots. Baltimore County Police Chief James Johnson said the gunman fired once before he was grabbed by Guidance . counselor Jesse Wasmer, and then another shot went off and hit the ceiling as he struggled with Wasmer and other teachers. Shooting: A 17-year-old male student was shot in the back by another student at Perry Hall High School in Baltimore on Monday morning; it was the students' first day back . Jordan Coates, a 17-year-old student who was in the cafeteria at the time of the shooting, said the student used a shotgun. Coates said he watched teachers, including Wasmer, pin the shooter against a vending machine. 'My back was to the door. I heard a . pop and thought it was a bag because people do that, but then I heard . another one,' Coates told The Associated Press. Savior: Wasmer, pictured with his wife Elizabeth, grabbed the gun from the student and held him until other teachers came over . 'And I turned around and . a teacher had a kid pinned up against the vending machine, and I saw . the barrel, and another shot goes off and people just start running.' Coates added that Wasmer 'grabbed the gun from the kid and got him' until other teachers came over. Wasmer, 31, a graduate of Perry Hall who also coaches lacrosse, was married over the summer. Later on Monday, Twitter erupted with tributes and messages of thanks for the guidance counselor. One tweet read: 'Mr Wasmer is the man!!!! Never take him for granted bcuz (sic) he risked his life for over 2,000 of us.' Another said: 'If Wasmer wasn't there, imagine what would have happened. Thank God for him.' A Facebook page called 'Thanks Mr . Wasmer' has nearly 10,000 'likes' and is full of messages of support and . thanks for the heroic guidance counselor. Some students, who witnessed the chaos, said that there was a scuffle right before the shooting. 'I . heard two large bangs and I saw people running and it was chaos and . everybody ran outside, and the principal told us to stay in the grass . area and away from the cafeteria,' a student told WJZ. Miranda Wienecke, a junior, told the Baltimore Sun that she saw the suspect with a 'huge black thing' that she suddenly realised was a gun. 'I . saw people getting under the table,' Wienecke said.'Then I saw people . running. We heard this huge boom, then there was another one, everything . happened very fast.' Random attack: Officers believe that the shooter, who was also a student at Perry Hall High School, fired at random and struck the teen . Facebook threat: Parents have said that there may have been a threat on Facebook which referenced the school. It reportedly said, 'First Day of School, Last Day of Life' A woman who was speaking from Gladden's home and . said she was related to the father, gave the following statement on the . family's behalf: 'We are horrified. We did not see this coming and our . thoughts and prayers are with the victim and the victim's family.' When asked about a motive for the shooting, Gladden's father indicated his son had been bullied. He gave no further details. The victim remained in critical condition at Maryland Shock Trauma Center and when the school reopened, a brief prayer vigil was held for him. Detectives were interviewing the suspected shooter Monday afternoon, Baltimore County police spokeswoman Elise Armacost said. Investigators were also searching Gladden's home for an hour and a half yesterday and were seen carrying out some guns, reported the Baltimore Sun.

Ouch: Marcie Edmonds, pictured, was stung with a whopping $83,046 medical bill after she was stung by a scorpion last June . An Arizona woman was stung with a whopping $83,046 medical bill after being attacked by a scorpion last June. Marcie Edmonds, 52, of Phoenix, was opening a box of air-conditioner filters in her garage when the insect stung her on the bottom, according to AZcentral.com. After her throat tightened, her vision blurred and she became unable to walk or breathe properly, she hurried to nearby Chandler Regional Medical Center. At the hospital emergency room, a doctor told her a scorpion anti-venom, called Anascorp, would relieve her symptoms. But he never told her the drug cost an astronomical $39,652 per dose neither did he offer up an alternative, she claims. Edmonds was given two doses of the drug administered through an IV drip and was discharged after just three hours once her symptoms subsided. Weeks later a bill for $83,046 dropped through her Ahwatukee Foothills letterbox. According to Arizona Republic, the anti-venom costs just $100 a dose at pharmacies in Mexico, suggesting the state's hospitals are making a fortune. The Food and Drug Administration approved the sale of the drug in the United States last year. Tennessee-based Rare Disease Therapeutics sold the drug to a distributor . for $3,500 per dose, and the distributor charged hospitals about $3,780 . per dose. Scorpion: The woman was stung by the scorpion while in her garage last June (stock photo) The newspaper asked a number of local . hospitals in November how much they were charging for the anti-venom . and found the cost per dose ranged from $7,900 to $12,467.

Saad Al-Hilli, 50, was ambushed with his family on Wednesday during a family outing in the French Alps . Three adult members of a seemingly respectable family, each murdered with a single shot in the head. A seven-year-old girl left with life-threatening injuries and her younger sister badly traumatised after somehow escaping  alive from a psychopathic killer. A cyclist who is believed to have witnessed the bloodbath mercilessly assassinated. Such barbarity would be shocking in some of the world’s most lawless countries: Afghanistan, Iraq, Colombia... But for it to happen in a car park near the tranquil shores of Lake Annecy in the French Alps makes the crime infinitely more difficult to comprehend. And, crucially, much more difficult to solve. What better location for a professional hit than in a remote area, with few if any witnesses likely to see the atrocity, with quick road access to airports in three countries – France, Italy and Switzerland, and even further afield. As French police launched an . extensive manhunt to find the killer or killers, investigators were . officially keeping an open mind about the motive for the crime and who . might have been behind it. The . ruthless efficiency with which the murders were carried out suggested . strongly that Saad Al-Hilli, his wife Ikbal and the rest of his family . were specific targets, and the cyclist killed because he saw too much. Pictures of the murder scene – in an . isolated forest car park, 2.5 miles from the nearest village – show how . the BMW was hit with automatic fire before the victims were finished off . at point-blank range. Had Mr Al-Hilli and his family been . targeted in the UK, police would probably have had access to CCTV . footage and data from number-plate recognition cameras, in their hunt . for the killer’s escape vehicle. Scroll down for video . But in Chevaline there has never been . any need for security cameras, another possible clue that the killer . may have carefully researched the best place, in terms of escaping . detection, to commit the crimes. A . quick look at a local map shows he could have been out of France within . minutes of the murders on Wednesday, possibly boarding a plane from . Geneva within two hours. Or . perhaps he elected to drive several hours across Europe. Several . witnesses reported seeing a car speeding away from the scene near . Albertville, in France’s Haute-Savoie region, close to the Italian and . Swiss borders, around the time of the attack. No arrests were made in the immediate aftermath of the attack, nor did police report the discovery of any weapon. Bullet-ridden: Police gather evidence from the BMW estate where Saad Al-Hilli and his family was massacred by a suspected assassin . Delayed reaction: Several hours after police arrived on scene, Mr Al-Hilli's four-year-old daughter Zeena was found alive huddling under her mother's legs inside the car . Crime scene: French gendarme police escort the car involved in the shooting of the British family away from the area . But . 15 spent, automatic pistol cartridges were found at the scene. ‘It was . clearly an act of extreme savagery and it was obvious that whoever did . this wanted to kill,’ said French prosecutor Eric Maillaud. If . Mr Al-Hilli’s family were deliberately targeted, police will want to . establish how the killer knew where they were. Did he wait outside their . campsite before ambushing them in the countryside? The . Iraqi-born British businessman’s commercial activities and political . affiliations in his homeland will also be key lines of inquiry. The bodies being taken away from the scene in a private ambulance escorted by police . Tragedy: French police on guard near the site of the brutal slaying . London link: The home of Saad Al-Hilli in Claygate, Surrey . But French police, whose track record in investigating the murders of British nationals makes uncomfortable reading, would be foolish to rule out other possible explanations. Already there has been speculation that the attack may have been a case of mistaken identity linked to drugs. Another theory is that shots could have been fired during a bungled armed robbery, with the dead cyclist being a witness to the crime. Reports suggest the same gang may have carried out previous attacks. Another possibility is that the crimes were racially motivated, or that the gunman is mentally ill. The French prosecutor described the carnage as being like something seen in a film. In most crime movies, the killer is finally brought to justice. If this was a professional hit, it will be a serious challenge for the French police to live up to that script.","Remote location at car park near Lake Annecy would mean few if any witnesses to the atrocity .

It's normally only women  who are trained in the art of turning curtains into costumes and become a dab hand at changing nappies at a world-famous nanny college. But now one male teenager is set to be the first-ever man to pass through the education degree course that turns out the modern Mary Poppins. Now Michael Kenny is hoping to become practically perfect in every way while he attends Norland College, in Bath. Practically perfect in every way: Michael Kenny, joins his fellow students on his first day at Norland College . Student Michael Kenny, 18, is the only male in a classroom full of 48 women studying at the college - but it takes more than a spoonful of sugar to pass the demanding course. Michael, who has had to endure lots of . jokes from his friends, admitted he initially wasn’t even sure if the . college in Bath, Somerset, took on male students. He had to ring the college to check - because he had only ever seen female students around the city. Now while his female counterparts wear . the classic cream dress and brown hat, he will don a tweed jacket, . cream shirt, matching tie and beige trousers for his studies. Warm welcome: Fellow students Louise Flatley, Alice Jefferies, Annalise Hobbs, Flo Richardson and Lucy Sheridan make Michael feel at home . Spot the odd one out: Michael will be put through his paces alongside his female peers on the course . But he says instead of feeling out of the loop he has been warmly welcomed by all of the female students. Michael said: 'Funnily enough they have just been caring more about how I have been feeling, making sure I am OK.' Michael says he was drawn to the job because he has spent time teaching English and maths to severely disabled children in an Ugandan orphanage. Holding the baby! Michael is pictured with (left to right) Alexandra Adam, 19, Joanna Bennet, 19, and Olivia Mitchell, 18, as he begins his new studies . Supercallifragilisticexpialidocious nannies!

Spick and span: Michael is neatly turned out for his first day of college, which boasts that every single graduate leaves there with a job . Students base themselves on the perfect nanny, Mary Poppins . He said: 'I wanted to work with children . because I can understand young people a lot better - I find them a lot . easier to get on with. 'I think I would like to be a nanny for a few years, because it is the whole reason you go through the training. 'But then after that I would like to do a PGCE and become a nursery teacher or work in a prep school.' Michael, whose parents Simon and Mary, sister Alice, 17, and brother John, 12, live in Uganda, will be only the second male in the college’s 120-year history to graduate with the Norland Diploma. Norland College principal Liz Hunt welcomed Michael to the fold and said her supercallifragilisticexpialidocious students were more in demand than ever before. She claimed every graduate will have a job offer sourced by the college’s in-house nanny agency so they are ready to start straight after finishing their studies. Mrs Hunt said: 'We always have more job opportunities than we have students, the demand certainly outstrips supply. 'The modern-day Norland graduate also goes on to work in a wide range of careers such as management of nurseries or primary school teaching.' Peter Cummins was the first 'manny' to study at the world-famous Norland College for nannies.He was the only male among his class of 21 girls to take the three year Diploma course and passed 'with merit'. Peter, 22, from Dyfed, Wales, said at the time: 'I don't see any problem. My careers adviser hinted that it was very female-dominated, but I took no notice. Pay attention class!

Norland College, in Bath, Somerset - motto 'Love Never Faileth' - has trained more than 7,000 nannies since it was founded in 1892 by Emily Ward. It was originally named the Training School for Ladies as Children's Nurses, but it quickly became known as Norland Institute because of its location on Norland Place in London, before relocating to Bath in 2003. Emily Ward introduced a uniform so Norland graduates needed to be recognised as professionals and not mistaken for housemaids and it is still a strong part of the college's tradition.

The Home Secretary spoke out as MPs debated a motion calling for government action to reduce net migration sharply. The motion was passed without a vote. The debate was held  after more than 140,000  people signed a Downing Street e-petition entitled ‘No to 70million’. Official forecasts say that, at current rates, the UK’s population will climb from 62.3million to 70million within 15 years. Net migration – the difference between the number of people entering the UK, and those leaving – is currently more than 200,000 a year. Mrs May said she was determined to fulfil the Government’s pledge to cut net migration to the ‘tens of thousands’. But she told MPs: ‘I have never been one that believes governments should be setting a figure in that sort of sense.’ During the debate, led by Labour’s Frank Field and Tory backbencher Nicholas Soames, a string of MPs warned of the huge pressure unprecedented levels of immigration were placing on public services. Tory Andrew Turner said that, under Labour, ‘the number of migrants allowed into this country was far and away in excess of what we needed for economic growth’.

Because the sun is shining they’ve all . been buying ice creams. ‘But . it won’t make up for the poor trade through the summer. There were days . when I didn’t sell a single ice cream, but hopefully this weekend will . be busy.’ Met Office forecaster Steven Keates said the upcoming warm weekend is ‘a bit of a bonus for mid-September’. He told MailOnline: . ‘It’s well above average for this time of year. The best of the weather . this weekend is going to be in the southern half of the UK on Saturday, . but many eastern areas will also do OK. ‘Any . rain will be probably confined to north-west Scotland, with . temperatures quite widely in the twenties from the Aberdeenshire area . all the way down to London.’ Parklife: (Left-to-right): Dottie, 16, Beth, 17, Georgia, 17, Grace, 17, and Becky, 16, enjoy the last of the summer sun on College Green in the centre of Bristol today .

Keates added: ‘I think by Monday into Tuesday, we're back to what we're . more used to in September - much cooler, showers and quite breezy - but . in itself, nothing unusual. ‘There are no signs over the next few weeks of anything exceptionally warm developing again. We're back to a changeable situation, with temperatures in the high teens, maybe into the twenties. ‘By Monday there will be more persistent rain in north Scotland and next week it will be quite a lot more unsettled - something for everyone.’ Making the most of it: A man reads a book on .

Posed up: Under cloudless clear blue skies, the sun beats down on visitors to the Angel of the North in Gateshead today, where they were enjoying the extended summer weather which is to last over the weekend . Hot and cold: The south of England will experience the best weather this weekend, although northern parts should also do well on Saturday - while much of the country will experience showers by Monday . The warm weather is expected to spread . across all of Britain on Saturday, with the exception of north-west . Scotland, but by Sunday it will be more confined to central and eastern . parts. 'It’s well above average for this time of year. The best of the weather this weekend is going to be in the southern half of the UK on Saturday, but many eastern areas will also do OK' Steven Keates, Met Office . Mr Keates told MailOnline: ‘It could well feel a little more humid by Sunday and it does bring the risk of the odd shower in south-west England. At the moment most places will probably stay dry on Sunday.’ Tonight the weather is expected to stay generally cloudy across north-west England and western Scotland, with further patchy light rain expected. It will be predominantly dry across the rest of the UK with clear periods, although mist and fog will develop quite widely as the night progresses and it will feel chilly in southern areas. On the up: Ice cream prices have soared by more than 25 per cent over the past five years . The demand for ice cream is slowly melting away as consumers are put off by high prices and switching to the more healthy option of frozen yoghurt, which is enjoying soaring sales. Analysts say Britons will eat 27million fewer litres of ice cream this year than in 2007, down 7 per cent, and spiralling prices mean the slide will continue over the next five years by another 7 per cent. Retail experts Mintel suggest total annual ice cream consumption will fall from 374million litres to 324million in the decade from 2007, meaning we will eat at least 500million fewer scoops a year. Mintel also reported that ice cream prices have soared by more than 25 per cent over the past five years as the prices of sugar and other raw materials have risen. Higher manufacturing and transport costs have also had an impact, despite heavy advertising and promotion. Amy Price, Mintel’s senior food analyst, said: ‘Almost a fifth of consumers are cutting back because of financial or health reasons. Together with the pressure on consumer incomes, this has gone some way to dampening demand.’","Highs in Britain on Saturday will be 27c (81f) and 28c (82f) on Sunday .

Arrested: Luke McCullough, 18, who was captain of Manchester United's Academy squad, was caught on CCTV having sex with a young woman . A rising Manchester United star has been arrested for ‘lewd behaviour’ after allegedly having sex with a teenage girl in a doorway. Luke McCullough, 18, who was last season's Academy captain, was seen on CCTV with the woman at 5am on Monday after a night out. The Northern Irish defender - said by Old Trafford bosses to be the new Jonny Evans - allegedly got ‘overly amorous’ with the blonde. The incident in Concert Square, a popular bar and restaurant district of Liverpool, will infuriate the club's senior manager, Sir Alex Ferguson. He expects high standards of his young players and just last week banned all of his under-23s from driving flashy sports cars from new club sponsors Chevrolet. During the incident, the smooching pair allegedly initially moved into a doorway semi-clothed, only for police to send a car to the scene. The couple were spoken to, did up their clothes and walked away - but just a few yards away went into another doorway and carried on, police said. Old Trafford: Manchester United bosses have described the Irish defender as the 'new Jonny Evans' and he is cited as a hot prospect . Officers went back the scene and arrested both for public order offences. The woman received a police caution after admitting the incident. The Northern Ireland youth captain and centre-back was held in police cells for several hours before being issued with a caution and sent home. 'They were all over each other and they . just couldn’t help themselves. Officers told them to move on and they . agreed but they didn’t get very far before they were at it again. We had no choice (but) to arrest them' Police source . A police source said: ‘The pair of them were spotted on CCTV in a virtual state of undress but it was only when they move to a doorway we had to send a patrol out. ‘They were all over each other and they just couldn’t help themselves. Officers told them to move on and they agreed but they didn’t get very far before they were at it again. ‘We had no choice (but) to arrest them because all and sundry would have seen what they were up to. Why they didn’t just get a room is beyond us.’ A Merseyside Police spokesman confirmed an 18-year-old man and a 19-year-old woman were arrested in Liverpool early on Monday morning. Unlikely to impress: The incident will infuriate the club's senior manager, Sir Alex Ferguson, who expects high standards of his young players . He said: ‘Both were taken into custody and spoken to by officers before receiving a formal police caution for a public order offence.’ Manchester United call McCullough an ‘accomplished defender who is building his reputation as a powerful, commanding presence. ‘ . The Portadown teenager joins a collection of Northern Irish players now at the club's Carrington training ground after arriving from Dungannon Swifts. He was compared with Belfast-born United first-team player Jonny Evans after he became captain of the Academy side in the 2011/2012 season. He was shortlisted for the Jimmy Murphy Young Player of the Year award, in memory of the ex-United assistant manager from the Busby Babes era.","Luke McCullough, 18, seen on CCTV on Monday, 5am .

A bride-to-be who was obsessed with having bronzed skin died in a sunbed salon only weeks after injecting herself with banned tanning drugs. Jenna Vickers, 26, collapsed inside a cubicle at the shop after telling friends she was ‘very happy’ with the unlicensed tanning products. It is believed she had bought a £25 kit containing melanotan off the internet three weeks earlier. Tragic: Fair-skinned Jenna Vickers, centre, poses with friends on a night out celebrating her birthday. She died after taking illegal injections to get a better tan . Beauty conscious: Miss Vickers was keen to use sun beds to get a tan and online conversations suggest she was using controversial injections for darker skin . This is a synthetic hormone which encourages the production of  melanin, the pigment which turns the skin brown when exposed to sunlight. Sales of the product are banned in the UK but it is available online across Europe and America. Health watchdogs have warned the side effects can be ‘extremely serious’ and studies have linked the injections to heart problems, high blood pressure and immune system damage. Miss Vickers had gone for her regular sunbed session at the Tantastic salon near her home in Bolton, Greater Manchester, on Monday morning. After she failed to come out of the cubicle, the manager broke the door down to find her lying lifeless on the floor. She called 999 and tried to revive Miss Vickers, who was taken to hospital but declared dead soon after. A post-mortem examination has been carried out but the cause of death has not been established. It is not known if Miss Vickers, described by friends as a ‘gorgeous, sweet girl’, injected the tanning product on the day of her death but she told friends she used it several weeks earlier. Scene: The TanTastic salon in Bolton where Miss Vickers collapsed on Monday morning while topping up her tan. The shop is not linked to any illegal injections . Floral tributes outside the tanning shop left by devastated family. One read: 'To our darling daughter Jenna. You are going to be so sadly missed. Good night God bless my sweet. Love mum and Russ' Tribute: Miss Vickers is understood to have ordered the tanning injections because she wanted to have a darker more tanned appearance . Last night Miss Vickers’ fiance, Bryan Watson, 26, and mother Shirley Mather were too upset to comment. Melanotan . injections have been nicknamed the 'barbie drug' for their cosmetic . appeal among beauty-conscious women. They come in two forms - melanotan I . and melanotan II. They both . work by increasing the levels of melanin, a dark pigment that provides . protection against the sun. Having more levels of melanin gives a darker . more tanned appearance when exposed to sun, either natural or . artificial. Both manmade drugs have undergone some limited clinical trials with some positive results for protecting against UV damage. There . are large numbers of websites selling the products and they have become . a craze among tan obsessives, bodybuilders and even some men who take . them for their sexual side-effetcs. However, . health experts have made repeated warnings that products on the market . are unlicensed and can have severe side-effects, ranging from nausea to . headaches and other 'potentially dangerous' unknown outcomes. The unlicensed drug is self injected, which means that there are serious needle safety issues to consider too. In a message posted on Facebook, Mrs Mather said: ‘Just cannot believe you have gone, you was the best daughter, best friend. We had a great mother n daughter relationship any one would wish for, you are goin to be so very sadly missed. ‘I cannot put into words how heartbroken I am. Sleep tight the angels are lookin after you now. See you again one day and we will have a catch up, love you from the bottom of my heart bye for now my love xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx.’ Yesterday floral tributes were left outside the tanning salon and friends left messages on a Facebook site set up in her memory. Lisa Rourke, manager of Tantastic, said: ‘What’s happened is really upsetting. Jenna used to come in here quite often to use the sun beds. ‘I knew she was using tanning injections – someone mentioned it – but she certainly didn’t get them from here. We don’t sell them and I don’t know anyone else who uses them. It’s dangerous, because no one knows the side effects.’ An inquest was opened and adjourned into Miss Vickers’ death yesterday. The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency said melanotan is unlicensed and therefore illegal for sale in the UK. A spokesman said they had the power to take down websites and fine anyone caught selling it. They added: ‘The MHRA would warn people not to use this product. ‘It is unlicensed in the UK and the side effects could be extremely serious.’ Miss Vickers and and fiance Brian Watson pose together in a picture she posted online recently. She was engaged and soon to be married to him . Happy: Miss Vickers and Mr Watson together before she died. The cause of death has not yet been established . In 2009, researchers at Liverpool John Moores University published an editorial in the British Medical Journal suggesting that use of melanotan ‘could damage the immune and cardiovascular systems as well as triggering other problems’. Bevis Man, of the British Skin Foundation, said it was ‘worrying’ that individuals routinely ignored warnings about tanning injections. He added: ‘The fact that the MHRA have yet to grant a licence to this product ought to serve as a warning to potential users. ‘There are other ways to get a tan without using an unregulated product or going on a sun bed.’","Jenna Vickers found slumped in cubicle topping up tan on Monday morning .

A fantasist who blogged about his experiences as a police officer during last summer’s London riots was today jailed for five years. Ellis Ward, 29, gained a massive following with his postings about life as a Met police inspector on the streets of London. As rioters took to the streets last summer, his blogs - which were used by national newspapers - and tweets about attempts to restore law and order enthralled thousands. Conman: Ellis Ward posed as a police officer on Twitter and gave bogus first-hand accounts of his experiences on the front line during last year's London riots . Writer: Ward was even hired to write a piece for the Daily Telegraph under his police alias - 'Inspector Winter' (stock picture) Inspector . Winter became the name synonymous with the police social media scene as . he described how he and his ‘team’ were dealing with looters and those . who had caused mayhem. He . spoke of 98-hour shifts, fatigue and fear and his never-ending crusade . to return the streets to decent folk, and at the height of his fame had . more than 3,000 Twitter followers. On one celebrated occasion he even told of a dawn raid which dealt with one miscreant looter who was still in bed. But . Ward’s charade as a police officer was not just restricted to the . internet, as he also posed as an Army major who had been injured in . Iraq. With an impressive . array of uniforms and identity cards, the serial conman used his aliases . to dupe three unsuspecting women out of thousands of pounds. Fraudster: Ward's Twitter posts on the riots gained thousands of Twitter followers (stock picture) Danger: He Tweeted about doing 98-hour shifts as an officer battling with rioters (stock picture) At Winchester Crown Court, Ward, of Bishop’s Cleeve, near Cheltenham, Gloucestershire, was jailed for five years after admitting 18 charges of fraud. Judge Peter Ralls QC told the him: 'You engaged yourself in a deception of quite staggering complexity. 'You lived a complete lie. You were in effect creating a fantasy world for yourself.' The judge told Ward he had used false identity cards and uniforms to commit a 'serious breach of trust' in defrauding the three women. 'The life you put forward was entirely without foundation,' the judge said. Ward . was wanted by Gloucestershire Police for fraud in 2009 but was released . from a nine-month prison sentence before officers could speak to him . and spent the next two and a half years on the run.

Deceit: On one occasion he even told of a dawn raid which dealt with a looter who was still in bed (stock picture) He was eventually arrested in February this year as forces including Essex, Wiltshire and Thames Valley helped track him down. Police found that as well as posing as a police officer, he also claimed to be a major in the Royal Military Police, and while living in Ware, Hertfordshire, he claimed to be a man called Ethan Winchombe. He told people that he had been invalided out of the Army after being injured in Iraq and had also spent time attached to the Serious Organised Crime Agency. Flames: The public was eager for information about the riots as they erupted in several English cities last summer (here a shop burns during the disorder in Croydon, south London - stock picture) Former girlfriends told police that Ward carried false warrant cards, real handcuffs, stop and search forms, witness statement forms and police pocket books. He also duped The Daily Telegraph . newspaper, who contacted him to give a first-person account of his . frontline duties in Tottenham and Croydon during the August riots. The newspaper paid . him £600 for a column called 'On the frontline.' Winchester . Crown Court heard Ward befriended one woman over the internet in . December 2008 and ran up credit card debts in her name of £30,000 over . the subsequent six months. He . also later met two other women online - one a serving police . community support officer who later became a PC - and conned them out . of a total of £12,000. Prosecutor Michael Williams told the . court: 'The defendant is a professional confidence trickster and over a . number of years has portrayed himself as a senior police officer and an . Army major injured in Iraq to gain the trust of, and defraud, women. 'There was no limit to the lies he was prepared to tell in order to get his hands on money.' Mr Williams said that when Ward met his first victim in December 2008 'everything he told her was a lie.' 'He told her he had been in the counter terrorism branch and had been diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder which was triggered by being sent to an address where he discovered his sister’s body,' said Mr Williams. 'He had previously been in the Ministry of Defence Police and while serving a tour of duty in Iraq had been injured by an IED (improvised explosive device).

Symbol of violence: The burnt-out Carpetright building in Tottenham, north London, where the rioting began last year (stock picture) Ward was seeing two of the women he defrauded at the same time. While living with one, he told the other that she could not visit his home as it was on a military base and would compromise his job. Daniel Higgins, defending, said Ward wished to apologise to all the people he had conned. 'He wishes for me to convey to the court, to those that have been affected, his remorse, whether or not it is accepted or believed,' he said. 'He genuinely liked and loved many of the people involved.' Mr Higgins said Ward felt excluded from society and did not believe he had an identity as he was without a birth certificate or driving licence. 'Ellis Ward never had a father in his life and his mother was an alcoholic who died in 2004,' he said. 'He told a psychiatrist that he wanted to have a real life, job and friends. In his mind he is somebody that does not exist. 'He has lived a lie and he does accept that he has put a great number of people through heartache.' Nikki Haywood, district crown prosecutor for the Crown Prosecution Service Wessex, said Ward had 'grossly abused the trust and the love of the women he had relationships with.' She revealed that Ellis had me and started relationships with women before and after his release from prison - telling them 'numerous lies' in order to defraud them by taking out credit cards in their names or loans. She said Ellis had been driven by 'pure greed' to commit the frauds.","Fraudster built up 3,000 Twitter followers as bogus policeman .

Casey Anthony’s family is hoping she’ll return to her Florida home for the first time since being cleared of murdering her daughter Caylee, Mail Online can reveal. The 26-year-old, who is considered the most hated woman in America, is considering paying a secret visit to say goodbye to her dying grandmother. Anthony, who has not been seen in public since her acquittal of murder last July, is known to have been close to Shirley Plesea. New Look: The last time the public saw Casey was when this video was released in October. She is said to be living in Palm Beach, Florida . Unanswered questions: Caylee Anthony disappeared from her Orlando home in June 16 2008 but was not reported missing until July 15 . The 85-year-old has been diagnosed with terminal cancer and given weeks to live, family members confirmed. Plesea is under the care of hospice staff in Orlando, Florida, and being looked after by Casey’s mother Cindy and her brother Dan at the home where she lived until her three year old daughter's death. Family members said Casey would want to say a final goodbye to her grandmother and would break cover to come out of hiding and pay her respects. Casey has been in hiding after receiving numerous death threats after walking free from court. Family members said she has been in contact with her mother and was aware of her grandmother's illness. Dan Plesea, Casey's uncle, told Mail Online: 'Cindy does know Casey's whereabouts. They are in contact. I am not saying anymore.' Asked if Casey would be returning to the family home he said: 'No comment.' Speaking . outside the Anthony home in Orlando, Plesea said his mother had been . diagnosed with terminal cancer and was in the final stages of her life. 'To be honest I did not think she would last as long as she has,' he said. 'Cindy and I are taking turns to look after her.' Plesea said he traveled from his home in North Fort Myers to stay with his sister in Orlando. Going home? If Casey Anthony returns to her family home in Orlando, Florida, it will be the first time since she was acquitted of murder . Friends of the family told Mail Online Cindy and her daughter Casey were now talking to each other after months of silence. The pair did not initially speak following the sensational murder trial that gripped America. Cindy was always a vocal supporter of Casey, even excusing her odd behavior after Caylee went missing. Many . trial observers believed by changing her testimony during the trial, . where she claimed she was responsible for internet searches on the use . of chloroform and not her daughter, played a key part in getting Casey . acquitted. 'There might have been a time when Casey wasn't talking to her mother, but not now,' said a friend. 'She will have been told all about her grandmother's illness. I am sure she will come home to pay her respects.' In hiding: West Palm Beach, Florida, where Casey Anthony is reported to be staying with a friend . Should Casey return to Orlando it will be the first time she has set foot inside the house since being arrested for the murder of her daughter in 2008. Neighbours in the housing development about five miles from Orlando International Airport are not so enthusiastic about the possibility of Casey's return. 'We don't want her back here,' said one neighbour, who declined to be named. 'We do not want all the attention that she will bring. Wherever she goes she will be followed the media. 'We had all that through the investigation and the trial, and we don't want it to start up again. As far as I am concerned I never want to see Casey Anthony again.' Since her acquittal in July 2011 Anthony has been living at a secret address, believed to be somewhere in south Florida. She has not spoken publicly, but in a phone interview with CNN's Piers Morgan admitted she feels like a prisoner in her own home. She spends her time cooking, reading books, exercising and watching television. Anthony denied media reports that she had piled on weight and planned to flee to Costa Rica to start a new life. She was reported to be living in West Palm Beach, but there were no confirmed sightings of her. As part of a yearlong probation order for an earlier offence of cheque fraud she has had to live in Florida. The probation period expired late last month meaning Anthony is free to choose where she wants to live. Sombre: Cindy and George Anthony, parents of Casey Anthony, arrive at the courtroom at Orange County Courthouse during her trial . Accused: Casey Anthony's lawyer accused her father George, left, of sexually assaulting her, and speculated that he killed Casey's daughter Caylee to cover up the abuse . With her lawyer Cheney Mason confirmed she has received death threats, there remains the possibility she will seek to forge a new life abroad. Officials have not said if Anthony will qualify be given a new identity as if she were in a witness protection programme. It is usually only defendants who give evidence in favour of prosecutors and whose life is at risk that are granted new identities. Casey was a murder suspect who was cleared by a jury, but given the level of hate that she still generates there remains the possibility Justice Department officials could look favourably on a request for a new name, social security number and passport. Although Caylee died over four years ago her death remains fresh in the minds of many members of the public who were outraged that Casey walked free from court. Caylee Anthony disappeared from her Orlando home in June 16th 2008. Her mother did not report her missing until July 15th and gave parents and authorities various excuses of where she was. Police searched for the toddler for five months, eventually finding Caylee's remains in a wood a mile from her grandparents' Orlando home. Emotional: Casey Anthony sobs as she is sensationally acquitted by a jury in July 2011 . Casey was charged with first degree murder and prosecutors said they would seek the death penalty. At her trial which began in May her lawyer Jose Baez stunned the courtroom by claiming Caylee had drowned while playing in her grandparents pool. To the astonishment of the prosecution lawyers he claimed Casey's father George helped cover up the young girl's death. He also said Casey had been sexually abused by her father - a charge he vehemently denied when taking the witness stand. Casey did not give evidence during the three month long trial and her lawyer described the mass of forensic evidence linking her to Caylee death as a 'fantasy'. The jury found Casey Anthony not guilty of first-degree murder and aggravated manslaughter of a child. While Anthony has remained silent the two principal lawyers in the case have written books about the trial . She was found guilty on four misdemeanor counts of providing false information to a law enforcement officer and sentenced to a year in jail. As she had spent 1043 days in custody she walked free 11 days after the end of her trial. It was expected that Casey would make more than $1m by talking about her acquittal to the TV networks. There was even talk of a multimillion dollar publishing deal. But such was the backlash from the public - with online polls overwhelmingly saying she was guilty - that no media outlet dared strike a deal. The NBC Today were considered front runners for an interview but after talk of the negotiations leaked out and complaints made to the network the planned interview was shelved. While Anthony has remained silent the two principal lawyers in the case have written books about the trial. In an explosive tell-all, defence lawyer Jose Baez accuses George Anthony of abusing his daughter, and speculates that George could have murdered 2-year-old Caylee to hide evidence of abuse. In his book, 'Presumed Guilty, Casey Anthony: The Inside Story,' Baez reveals aspects of the Anthony’s private lives that were not looked into during the trial. The lawyer accused George of killing the toddler to hide evidence of abuse. The book says Casey confided in Baez that she was worried her father might have fathered Caylee, because he had sex with her around the time she had become pregnant. DNA tests later revealed that George was not the father. Baez said prosecutors offered in 2008 to allow Anthony to plead guilty to aggravated manslaughter of a child and serve up to 13 years in prison.  He said that in those early days he thought taking it might be in Anthony's best interest. 'There were times, difficult times, when the evidence didn't look good for Casey,' Baez said, adding that it was his obligation as a lawyer to convey any such plea offers. Jeff Ashton, the lead prosecutor, also wrote a book called 'Imperfect Justice.' It is being turned into a Lifetime movie with Rob Lowe playing Ashton. The 322 page book was scathing of Anthony and her defence team saying the single mother produced numerous stories to explain away the disappearance of her daughter. The claim that Caylee drowned was dubbed 'Casey 4.0' – the fourth version of what she claimed happened to her daughter.","26-year-old is considered the most hated woman in America .
