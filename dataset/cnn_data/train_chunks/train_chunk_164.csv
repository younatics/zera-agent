"(Financial Times) -- The increasing amount of personal information that can been gleaned by computer programs that track how people use Facebook has been revealed by an extensive academic study. Such programmes can discern undisclosed private information such as Facebook users' sexuality, drug-use habits and even whether their parents separated when they were young, according to the study by Cambridge university academics. In one of the biggest studies of its kind, scientists from the university's psychometrics team and a Microsoft-funded research centre analysed data from 58,000 Facebook users to predict traits and other information that were not provided in their profiles. The algorithms were 88 per cent accurate in predicting male sexual orientation, 95 per cent for race and 80 per cent for religion and political leanings. Personality types and emotional stability were also predicted with accuracy ranging from 62-75 per cent. Facebook declined to comment. The study highlights growing concerns about social networks and how data trails can be mined for sensitive information, even when people attempt to keep information about themselves private. Less than 5 per cent of users predicted to be gay, for example, were connected with explicitly gay groups. Michal Kosinksi, one of the report's authors, told the Financial Times that the university's techniques could easily be replicated by companies to infer personal attributes a person did not wish to share, such as sexual orientation or political views: ""We used very simple and generic methods. Marketing companies and internet companies could spend much more time and resources, and hence get much higher accuracy than we did."" Last week , the EU agreed to water down proposals for a radical overhaul of data privacy regulation. The move reflects governments' reluctance to impede internet businesses that might spur economic growth, and follows fierce lobbying from technology companies including Facebook and Google. Personal data has become big business. Wonga, the UK online lender, makes credit judgments within seconds based on thousands of pieces of information, including an applicant's Facebook profile. Tesco, the supermarket chain, this month started to use its customers' shopping histories to sell targeted online advertising. The report also revealed some unexpected correlations -- such as people who liked 'curly fries' having higher IQs, while those who like Facebook's ""Sliding on Floors With Your Socks On"" page were unlikely to use drugs. Mr Kosinski said, however, that the study was not designed to discourage online sharing: ""I would discourage people from abstaining from the technology -- the milk is to some extent already spilt and there's a lot of information about you online anyway. I would suggest raising privacy settings and exerting consumer pressure by trying to use the services that are protecting your privacy best.""

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- A man who allegedly jumped a fence at Halle Berry's home twice last weekend and was prowling around her Hollywood Hills neighborhood Monday pleaded not guilty Wednesday to a felony stalking charge. Richard Anthony Franco, 27, was arrested at Berry's home late Monday by off-duty police officers hired by the Oscar-winning actress after two intrusions into her property on Saturday and Sunday, according to Los Angeles police. Berry, in a court filing seeking a restraining order against Franco, said police told her he ""has a criminal history of violence, theft and drug offenses."" He was ""carrying a book with nonsensical ramblings and my name written in his handwriting"" when he was arrested, she said. A neighbor alerted the officers to the presence of a ""possible burglar"" at 11:15 p.m. Monday, according to the Los Angeles County District Attorney's Office. The decision to charge Franco with a felony was announced Wednesday morning by the prosecutor's office. Franco, who was already on probation for misdemeanor battery, could face up to three years in prison if convicted on the stalking charge, the prosecutor said. Franco, a resident of Commerce, California, made an initial appearance in court Wednesday, where he entered his plea. The judged ordered him held in a Los Angeles jail on $150,000 bond until his preliminary hearing on July 27. A temporary restraining order was also issued, banning Franco from coming within 500 yards of Berry or trying to contact her via telephone. Investigators said Franco is the same man who intruded into Berry's yard two times last weekend. Both times he claimed he was ""there to see somebody,"" but left after a Berry employee ordered him out, police spokeswoman Sara Faden said. ""Richard Franco is a stranger to me and I have no desire to have any contact with him,"" Berry said in her statement. ""He has terrorized me and my family in three consecutive incidents over the last three days."" It's not unusual for photographers to stake out positions around Berry's Los Angeles home to get shots of the Oscar-winning actress, but investigators didn't know what this intruder was trying to do, Faden said. CNN's Rachel Wells contributed to this report.","NEW: Richard Anthony Franco, 27, enters a not guilty plea Wednesday .

"(CNN) -- Novak Djokovic and Victoria Azarenka continued their dominance of men's and women's tennis by registering straight-sets wins at the Indian Wells Masters in California. The respective Australian Open champions are unbeaten in 2013, with second-ranked Azarenka on a 17-match winning streak while world No. 1 Djokovic is 15-0 for the year. Djokovic overcame a first-set battle to beat Bulgaria's Grigor Dimitrov 7-6 (7-4) 6-1 in the third round. Next up for the 25-year-old top seed is soon-to-be U.S. No. 1 Sam Querrey. ""He started off well today (Tuesday), but then I think he gave me the break with four double faults,"" Serbia's six-time grand slam champion told the ATP World Tour's website. ""I haven't done much really in the match in the second set when I made two breaks. It was all of his unforced errors, so I just needed to hang in there and try to be patient. ""I just tried to stay positive and calm and hang in there and wait for the chances. So that's, I guess, the biggest positive I can take out of today's performance."" Querrey will usurp world No. 15 John Isner as the top American male tennis player after a 7-6 (7-5) 6-7 (7-9) 7-5 defeat of Australian 23rd seed Marinko Matosevic earned him a last-16 place. ""It means a lot. It's a great feeling,"" said Querrey, the last player to beat Djokovic in an ATP event, in Paris in November. ""I feel like I have worked hard to earn it. Everyone seems like they've got their shot with Andy (Roddick) and Mardy (Fish) and James (Blake) and John, and so I feel like it's my turn now."" Third seed Andy Murray saved five break points on his way to a 6-3 6-2 victory over Taiwan's Yen-Hsun Lu, avenging his defeat to the world No. 79 at the Beijing 2008 Olympics. Murray, the 2012 U.S. Open champion, will play Carlos Berlocq in the fourth round after the Argentine upset 16th seed Kei Nishikori. Berlocq's compatriot Juan Martin del Potro beat unseeded Bjorn Phau 6-2 7-5 to set up a meeting with the German's veteran compatriot Tommy Haas. In the women's draw, top seed Azarenka will play former world No. 1 Caroline Wozniacki in the quarterfinals after overcoming an ankle injury to beat Poland's Urszula Radwanska 6-3 6-1. ""It was pretty obvious I wasn't feeling that well -- my ankle was bothering me, it's been bothering me for a while, and it hasn't really been getting better,"" defending champion Azarenka told the WTA Tour's official website. ""But on the bright side, I won the match today. I overcame those things and -- I don't know how -- managed to just take my opportunities and really go for my shots and make it happen, and not just wait for her mistakes."" Wozniacki dug deep to get the better of Russian 10th seed Nadia Petrova, eventually emerging with a 7-6 (7-3) 6-3 success. ""Victoria has improved in a few ways that have helped her a lot,"" said the Dane. ""I think I'm playing well. She's obviously playing well. I'm looking forward to playing her again. We'll see what happens; I definitely need to bring my A-game."" Second seed Maria Sharapova, beaten by Azarenka in last year's final, will play 2012 French Open runner-up Sara Errani in the quarterfinals. Sharapova reached the last eight for a third successive year by beating Lara Arruabarrena-Vecino of Spain 7-5 6-0. ""I just didn't get a good rhythm on her game from the beginning,"" the Russian said. ""But I thought towards the end of the first and beginning of the second set I really stepped it up, was being more aggressive, and really gave myself a better margin than I did throughout the first set."" Italy's Errani won her eighth straight match, beating French ninth seed Marion Bartoli 6-3 6-2. Fifth seed Petra Kvitova reached the quarterfinals of the event for the first time in her career with a win over fellow Czech Klara Zakopalova. The 2011 Wimbledon champion set up a tie with Russia's Maria Kirilenko, who shocked Poland's world No. 4 Agnieszka Radwanska with a 6-1 4-6 7-5 triumph. The remaining quarterfinal pits Australian seventh seed Samantha Stosur against sixth-ranked German Angelique Kerber. Stosur came from behind to defeat another German, 24th seed Mona Barthel, while Kerber -- seeded fourth in the absence of world No. 1 Serena Williams and No. 5 Li Na -- beat Spanish qualifier Garbine Muguruza 6-4 7-5.","Novak Djokovic and Victoria Azarenka both continue winning runs at Indian Wells .

"(CNN) -- There may have been more alluring electric cars on display at this year's Tokyo Motor Show, but the beauty of this prototype lies in its performance. The SIM-LEI can travel 333 kilometers (more than 200 miles) on a single charge, say its Japanese creators SIM Drive, and it also boasts supercar-like acceleration -- 0 to 60 mph in just 4.8 seconds. The key to these remarkable statistics lies not, as you might expect, underneath the hood but in its wheels. Most electric vehicles house a single motor in the area vacated by the petrol engine, but the SIM-LEI has four motors, which fit in the hubs its wheels. Each one delivers 65 kilowatts, giving the car a total output of 260 kilowatts, compared with the 80 kilowatts of output available in, say, the Nissan Leaf. A 24.5 kWh battery sits below the floor along with inverters and controllers, which fit into a unique steel monocoque helping reduce weight, according to SIM Drive. More innovation: World's smallest car fuels nanotech advance . The SIM-LEI -- LEI stands for Leading Efficiency In-Wheel motor -- took 15 months to complete and builds on advances made with the fantastic-looking Eliica -- a super-fast eight-wheeler designed by SIM Drive CEO and President Hiroshi Shimizu. His latest design may not look so sporty but the SIM LEI does come with low-friction tires and a low-set chassis, which helps reduce drag, says the company. Recent technological advances are making in-wheel motors more attractive, says James Widmer, from the Center for Advanced Electrical Drives at the UK's Newcastle University. ""Motors have become more powerful for their weight and the volume they take up, which has made it more practical to get very good performance from putting electric motors directly in the wheels of cars,"" Widmer said. And electric motors provide drivers with far greater control than internal combustion engines, he says. ""If you do put an electric motor in each wheel then there are huge possibilities with things like traction control and stability control,"" he added. While car makers including Peugeot and Mitsubishi have used in-wheel motors in concept cars that have never been commercially available, SIM Drive hopes its four-seat sedan will go into production in 2013. SIM Drive says the price will depend on how many it makes, but if the car ends up being mass produced, customers can expect to pay around ÃÂ¥2.5 million ($32,000).","SIM-LEI car has an electric motor in each of its four wheels .

"Tehran, Iran (CNN) -- An Iranian court has delayed the final verdict of a 43-year-old woman sentenced to death by stoning, a human rights group said Sunday, two days after the country announced she will not be executed during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan. The International Committee Against Stoning did not say how it got its information on the postponement of Sakineh Mohammadi Ashtiani's final verdict, which had previously been scheduled to come down last Thursday. The group said in a statement that the final verdict in Ashtiani's case is now expected on August 21, the date of her lawyer's next court appearance. Iranian state TV broadcast a program about Ashtiani on Friday in which it said that she will not be executed during Ramadan, which began last week, the International Committee Against Stoning said Sunday. The mother of two faces a death sentence for adultery. Last month, Iran's top human rights official said the Islamic regime is reviewing her sentence. The International Committee against Stoning said Sunday that it and Ashtiani's family are ""extremely concerned"" about her fate. The group said that Iran has executed 73 people in recent days, including some on Friday. In an interview with Iranian state-run TV last week, Ashtiani denounced her lawyer and said she knew about a plot to kill her husband, but human rights groups alleged that the statements were coerced. ""Televised 'confessions' have repeatedly been used by the authorities to incriminate individuals in custody,"" Amnesty International said Thursday, a day after Ashtiani's interview ran on state-run TV. ""Many have later retracted these 'confessions,' stating that they were coerced to make them, sometimes under torture or other ill-treatment. One of the condemned woman's lawyers, Mohammad Mostafaei, said his client made those comments ""to save her life"" and noted that the death sentence for murder charges related to her husband's death had been commuted. Brazil has offered to give asylum to Ashtiani but Iran has rejected the proposal. In an interview with the state-owned Agencia Brasil news outlet, however, Iranian Ambassador Mohsen Shaterzadeh said Brazil had not made a formal offer to the Iranian government for asylum. But Agencia Brasil said Brazil's foreign minister, Celso Amorim, had reiterated on Wednesday the government's offer to have Ashtiani sent to the South American nation. ""I think there is no need to create some trouble for President Lula (Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva) and to take her to Brazil,"" Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad told the country's state-run Press TV in an interview. ""We are keen to export our technology to Brazil rather than such people."" Ahmadinejad said he had spoken with the head of the judiciary ""and the judiciary does not also agree with such a thing.""","Sakineh Mohammadi Ashtiani faces a death sentence in Iran for adultery .

"New Orleans, Louisiana (CNN) -- Interior Secretary Ken Salazar on Tuesday called a six-month halt on deepwater drilling ""needed, appropriate and within our authorities"" in announcing he will issue a new order on a moratorium just hours after a federal judge blocked such a mandate. ""We see clear evidence every day, as oil spills from BP's well, of the need for a pause on deepwater drilling,"" Salazar said in a statement. ""That evidence mounts as BP continues to be unable to stop its blowout, notwithstanding the huge efforts and help from the federal scientific team and most major oil companies operating in the Gulf of Mexico."" Salazar's statement did not give an exact date for when the new order would be imposed, saying only ""in the coming days."" He promised that the new order will include evidence that ""eliminates any doubt that a moratorium is needed, appropriate, and within our authorities."" U.S. District Judge Martin Feldman in New Orleans, Louisiana issued a preliminary injunction Tuesday against the ban, which halted all drilling in more than 500 feet of water and prevented new permits from being issued. The White House said it would appeal the ruling. President Barack Obama ordered the moratorium after the April 20 explosion of the Deepwater Horizon, an oil rig off Louisiana. Eleven people died in the blast, which triggered an underwater oil gusher. Brian Collins, an attorney for the Justice Department, insisted Monday that the suspension is necessary while officials conduct a safety review. But a group of companies that provides boats and equipment to the offshore drilling industry filed a lawsuit claiming the government has no evidence that existing operations pose a threat to the Gulf of Mexico and asked the court to declare the moratorium invalid and unenforceable. Feldman agreed, writing in his ruling, ""an invalid agency decision to suspend drilling of wells in depths of over 500 . feet simply cannot justify the immeasurable effect on the plaintiffs, the local economy, the Gulf region, and the critical present-day aspect of the availability of domestic energy in this country."" White House spokesman Robert Gibbs said the government will immediately appeal the ruling to the 5th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals. ""The president strongly believes, as the Department of Interior and Department of Justice argued yesterday, that continuing to drill at these depths without knowing what happened does not make any sense,"" Gibbs said. Such drilling ""puts the safety of those involved, potentially puts safety of those on the rigs and the safety of the environment and the Gulf at a danger that the president does not believe we can afford right now."" In issuing the ruling, Feldman said, ""the court is unable to divine or fathom a relationship between the findings (of the government) and the immense scope of the moratorium. The plaintiffs assert that they have suffered and will continue to suffer irreparable harm as a result of the moratorium. The court agrees."" Transocean President Steve Newman, whose company owned the Deepwater Horizon, said Tuesday that he supported ending the moratorium, and the office of Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal filed a brief in support of blocking the moratorium. Jindal and Sen. Mary Landrieu, D-Louisiana, were among those asking the Obama administration Tuesday not to appeal the ruling. ""I'm going to strongly urge the administration not to appeal this ruling, but to try to find a way forward that would achieve the president's goals for safety and responsibility, but at the same time would not jeopardize and threaten a very vibrant and necessary industry for decades,"" Landrieu told reporters during a conference call. iReport: In the Gulf? Share your experience with BP . Legendary Texas oil and gas executive T. Boone Pickens also said such a ban is not needed. ""The accident that BP has had could be likened to qualified pilots in an airliner and they have pilot error,"" he told CNN's ""Campbell Brown"" program Tuesday night. ""(An) airliner crashes, starts a 50,000-acre forest fire and we shut down all flying? No more airlines until we have six months to see what happened?"" Ken Wells, the president of the Offshore Marine Service Association, said Tuesday that while the ruling is positive for his group -- which represents many of the ships that service oil rigs -- the decision is ""tempered by the realization this is a big, strong government. And if they want to keep fighting on this, they will keep fighting."" Wells told CNN that many of the small business owners and workers who support the rigs felt ""like innocent bystanders in all this,"" adding that many of them are losing their jobs left and right. He said Feldman's decision ""may help our industry survive."" Government estimates indicate as much as 60,000 barrels (2.5 million gallons) of oil may be flowing into the Gulf every day, and the gusher has already taken a serious toll on tourism and the fishing industry in Gulf Coast states. BP said Tuesday it had collected 25,830 barrels -- 1.08 million gallons -- of oil from the gushing undersea well over the past 24 hours. The amount is the most ever collected; the previous record was set Thursday when 25,290 barrels were collected. The company announced Tuesday that it will donate net revenues it receives from the sale of oil recovered from the spill to the National Fish and Wildlife Federation. Also Tuesday, protesters in London, England, briefly disrupted an oil conference that BP CEO Tony Hayward pulled out of a day earlier. Just before the welcoming speech by BP chief of staff Steve Westwell, who was standing in for Hayward at the World National Oil Companies Congress, a woman got on stage and started shouting. Security quickly removed her. The woman was Greenpeace campaigner Emma Gibson, who told the crowd that ""because BP is incapable of telling you the truth, I'm going to tell you what you need to know."" Hayward decided not to attend the conference because of his ""commitment to the Gulf of Mexico relief effort,"" a BP spokesman said Monday. Westwell started his speech by apologizing on Hayward's behalf for him not being at the conference. He said the past few weeks have been ""extremely difficult for BP."" ""It has been hugely shocking for us, for America, and for the rest of the world,"" Westwell said. ""Everyone at BP is devastated, and we deeply regret what's happened. Our hearts go out to those who have lost loved ones. And we are profoundly aware of our responsibilities to those people whose livelihoods and neighborhoods have suffered."" Kenneth Feinberg, who is overseeing BP's $20 billion escrow claims fund, met with Alabama Gov. Bob Riley on Tuesday in what Riley described as a ""very, very productive meeting"" to discuss ways to accelerate the claims payment process. ""I will be back quickly to spend as much time as it takes to make sure that this program is designed and implemented in an expeditious manner,"" Feinberg said. BP said in a statement Monday that costs from the disaster now total about $2 billion, including the cost of the response, containment, relief well drilling, grants to Gulf states, claims paid and federal costs. To date, more than 65,000 claims have been submitted and more than 32,000 payments totaling more than $105 million have been made, the company said. Elsewhere, a spokesman for Iran's foreign ministry said the Islamic republic, which has chilly relations with the United States, would consider helping America with the oil spill if asked, according to the Iranian Labour News Agency. ""The difficult solution of an oil spill, from the standpoint that it's a humanitarian problem, persuades all countries to offer help,"" ILNA quoted Foreign Ministry spokesman Ramin Mehmanparast as saying. CNN's Anderson Cooper, Eric Marrapodi, Chris Lawrence, Alan Silverleib, Matthew Chance, Vivian Kuo and Ethan Harp contributed to this report.","NEW: Salazar says ban is ""needed"" and ""appropriate""

"(RollingStone.com) -- Season four of ""The Voice,"" featuring Usher and Shakira filling in for Cee Lo Green and Christina Aguilera, taped blind auditions recently, and Rolling Stone had a chance to watch the new judges in action. What we saw in our brief glimpse into the new season was that there will be no messing around. All four judges, including returnees Adam Levine and Blake Shelton, mean business. When we spoke to Usher at iHeart Radio in Las Vegas in September he promised to promote a competitive edge, but he isn't the only one bringing that attitude. At the audition we saw some friendly competition between Usher and Shakira over one contestant, and when Usher bested Levine for another vocalist at the audition, he playfully taunted his fellow judge. 'The Voice' Season Three Awards . During a junket featuring all four judges and show creator Mark Burnett, Shelton confirmed this season will give new meaning to the term ""battle rounds."" ""I would say the competitiveness is up,"" he said. ""We've replaced Cee Lo with somebody that's just that much more aggressive. And Christina was always competitive, [but] now you've got four that are just killers up here."" Levine agreed that Shakira might be the one they have to watch out for. ""You have a pregnant, hormonal Colombian,"" he says. ""She's ready to bust some heads. She ain't messing around."" Shakira said she is happy to be welcomed with humor, as it shows her she is part of the family. ""Spending some time with these guys, I can only tell you that it is the best -- they joke all the time and make me laugh onstage, offstage,"" she said. ""They have been such great hosts making us, Usher and me, feel at home at all times."" Cover story excerpt: 'The Voice' But the battle we witnessed over contestants was real, she insisted: ""There's a lot of competitiveness, of course. Once we are in the process of trying to get a contestant recruited for our team, there's a lot of adrenalin, and there's a lot of tension, but the healthy kind."" Both of the new coaches believe they bring more than just a new intensity. ""You can't really compare my style to anybody,"" Usher said. ""My style is more military than anything, because I'm all about the preparation and have always been. I rehearse a million times to be prepared. My style is to make them understand the seriousness of the craft and that they have the very best opportunity to be the greatest or the worst, depending on how you take it."" As for Shakira's approach, she views it as very involved. ""Besides being a singer, I'm also a producer and writer. Once I'm in the recording studio, I am so hands-on,"" she said. ""While I'm coaching my team I tend to focus on the detail. I don't know if it's maybe because of the female condition, but men are more focused on the general aspects, and women tend to sort of focus on details a lot. And so when I'm giving directions to my contestants I'm particularly focused on details."" ""She plays the female card quite a bit,"" Levine said. ""That's one thing we can't compete with, really."" 'The Voice' renewed for two more seasons . As the proven commodities, Levine and Shelton, who between them coached the winning contestants in all three previous seasons, feel they still have an edge. ""There are many advantages to being the seasoned veteran, starting with we've seen about 4,000 more auditions,"" Levine says. ""We fell into the traps that the newbloods will fall into and dig themselves out of because they are strong, and they will survive, but we know from experience where we've been, where we're going, how to get through this. But these guys are smart and quick studies, so they are probably going to get better quickly, and it's going to suck for us because then they will probably win this damn thing."" Usher brings in his own experience, having mentored Justin Bieber to the top of the charts, and Levine says that does count for a lot. ""As much as I hate to say this about another coach in the beginning, Usher has done what this show has yet to do,"" he says. ""You have launched a superstar, and that's our goal. That's the show's goal. That's something we want to do as an institution."" Usher agreed. ""The one thing that I hope is to come into this show and be able to score an incredible entertainer that people will talk about for years and years and track it back,"" he says. ""I am kind of a living example of that. I started on Star Search, and my career kind of launched from there."" How long he and Shakira will remain on the show is up in the air. ""Everybody can't coach for life,"" said Burnett, ""because when you have people with current recording in the game, this is not their job. Their job is their fans and making music and being live, and so we knew from the beginning that this would happen. They all have another life and their schedules."" Shakira concurred that while this is where she is now, her music comes first. ""We are not judges. It's not what we do for a living,"" she said. ""We have musical careers that we have to attend to, but we are embarking on this great adventure and enjoying it until we feel that we have to get back to our first and most important duties with music.""

"HONG KONG, China (CNN) -- In the world of business -- where book titles like ""Only the Paranoid Survive"" thrive -- successful executives hope for the best but plan for the worst. Quarantined guests at Hong Kong's Metropark hotel wave to world press. But no amount of planning could have prevented the bad luck that befell the Metropark hotel group last week. The Metropark Hotel in Wanchai was shut down when a guest -- having recently arrived from his native Mexico -- fell ill with the city's first reported case of H1N1. City health officials, chastened by the experience of SARS, quickly quarantined the hotel and its nearly 300 guests and employees. The city is trying to avoid a repeat of what happened in 2003, when a doctor from nearby Guangzhou came to the Hong Kong to attend a wedding. During his one-night stay the doctor, who had been treating patients with an unusual respiratory ailment, fell ill himself. He infected at least 10 other guests, according to Hong Kong University research. Those guests then spread SARS to the rest of world. That hotel? The Metropark Hotel in Kowloon. Formerly known as the Metropole, that hotel was ground zero for the first reported case of SARS in Hong Kong. Both hotels are among four properties owned in the city by a subsidiary of China Travel International, which operates 50 hotels in China. With the world press corps parked outside taking photographs of bored, confined customers, the hotel chain is realistic about its potential impact on business. ""Revenue loss and image damage is a concern,"" said Benny Ng, an operations manager for the chain. ""When an incident like this happens, obviously, it will have a little impact on the business. ""With this and the incident in 2003, (the situation) was not caused by the hotel, and has nothing to do with the hygiene or the facilities of the property,"" he said. ""What we can do is try our best to make our guests, and the staff, comfortable to help them to overcome the quarantine and difficult times in forthcoming days."" The markets seem to have shrugged off the flu scare -- shares of Hong Kong-listed China Travel International rose by nearly 6 percent in trading Monday. Still, what are the odds of the city's first reported outbreak of two separate new illnesses being found at the same small hotel chain? To calculate that, you would need to consider a variety of factors akin to the computation of lightning striking the same place twice. ""It does seem like a bit of a freak occurrence,"" said Dr. Alan D Miller, an expert on economics and game theory at the University of Haifa. ""But freak occurrences do happen.""","Metropark Wanchai guest Hong Kong's first reported H1N1 case .

"Boston (CNN)  -- James ""Whitey"" Bulger was raised in a tight-knit world of Irish families in a community that protected its own. There were three boys in one room, six girls in another. As he grew up, authorities say, it wasn't long before he became one of Boston's most notorious gangsters. He learned to fight and survive on the mean streets of South Boston -- ""Southie"" to residents -- and to local kids who wanted to emulate him, he was iconic. ""The guy was legendary,"" said John Shea, a former drug runner for Bulger who served 12 years in prison for cocaine trafficking. ""He was legendary of being the guy that controlled everything that ever happened in South Boston and for the Irish Mafia. He made tough guys shake."" But for the past 15 years, authorities said the man feared across Southie lived a quiet, reclusive life in a small Southern California apartment. Before his arrest in June, Bulger and longtime girlfriend Catherine Greig passed themselves off as ""Charlie and Carol Gasko"" to their neighbors in the Los Angeles suburb of Santa Monica. During that time, the fugitive Bulger became ""the Elvis of gangsters,"" as one former FBI official put it, even as his escape from a pending indictment led to a scandal that tarnished the bureau. Bulger's life on the lam . Bulger has pleaded not guilty to 19 counts of murder, while Greig is charged with harboring a fugitive. By the time the two met, Bulger had served 10 years for bank robbery in federal prisons -- first in Alcatraz, then Leavenworth. After getting out, he vowed he would never go back to jail. When Boston Globe reporters Dick Lehr and Gerard O'Neill began their groundbreaking reporting on Bulger in the 1980s, they discovered a single, compelling fact. ""He hadn't gotten so much as a parking ticket since he was released,"" Lehr said. Bulger's lack of a record after 1965 was all the more startling, since Lehr and O'Neill found he was being investigated by Boston police and the Massachusetts State Police after a series of killings he was suspected of carrying out himself or ordering others to commit. There was a reason Bulger was able to remain untouched: He was a confidential informant for the FBI, a federal judge later concluded in a 600-plus-page report in 1999. More than that, the agent closest to Bulger, John Connolly, routinely informed Bulger about ongoing investigations, federal documents later showed. Lehr said Connolly ""did everything, including breaking all kinds of laws over the years to keep that alive."" Beyond the Bulger lore: Ten victims . Connolly, now serving a 40-year prison term, did Bulger one final favor in the mid-1990s. He told him of pending indictments for drug and racketeering charges brought by agencies outside the FBI, and Bulger fled. He was on the FBI's Most Wanted List for more than 15 years, second only to al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden as the bureau's priority. Former FBI Agent Tom Fuentes, now a CNN consultant, says the bureau received more than 12,000 tips over the years about Bulger and where he might have been seen. In one case, Fuentes said, agents received a tip that Bulger would be on flight to an unknown city in South America. ""There were thousands of police officers involved in that round-the-clock operation,"" Fuentes said ""Everyone went full bore to follow up on those leads and try to find him. In a way, he became the Elvis of gangsters."" But all along, it seems, Bulger and Greig were in Santa Monica, in a small apartment four blocks from the Pacific Ocean beaches, according to their building manager. Bulger's 'relatively comfortable' lifestyle . One neighbor, 88-year-old Catalina Schlank, told CNN she saw the couple she knew as the Gaskos regularly. They were friendly, she says, but cautious about giving away too much information. ""We were good neighbors, and we met mostly in the lobby picking up the mail,"" Schlank said. In one encounter, ""I said, 'I don't see your husband coming and going with you.' 'No,' she said, 'He has depression. He doesn't sleep at night and starts sleeping at five in the morning.' And then it seemed he was better."" On one occasion, she asked the couple to be a point of contact in the case of emergency. They refused. The couple did not have a car, paid for everything in cash and had a phone number that went directly to an answering service, Schlank said. ""I asked her, 'Can you give me your phone so I can call you?' So she gave me a number, but that number goes to an answering service,"" she said. ""They take the message and they relay it to Mr. Gasko. And if they wanted, they would answer. If they didn't, you wouldn't get an answer."" Ultimately, the FBI began airing a public service announcement with an emphasis on Greig. Less than two days later, a tip generated because of that television campaign led to the couple's arrest in Santa Monica. How they caught him . Inside, prosecutors said they found more than $800,000 in cash and 30 weapons, including handguns, an automatic rifle and a hand grenade.","James ""Whitey"" Bulger had been an FBI informant for years before being indicted .

"(CNN) -- The U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved a new prescription diet drug called Qsymia on Tuesday. The medication produced dramatic weight loss in clinical trials, but some are concerned over potential side effects, including increased heart rate, birth defects and other issues. Qsymia (pronounced kyoo-SIM-ee-uh) is the second diet drug approved this year. The FDA approved a weight-loss pill called Belviq on June 27. Qsymia had been known as Qnexa until its approval. The FDA asked the company to change the name to avoid confusion with another drug on the market, according to the company. Patients in clinical trials experienced more dramatic weight loss with Qsymia than with Belviq. On Qsymia, patients went from an average 227 pounds to 204 pounds; on Belviq, the average weight dropped from 220 to 207. Some consumer advocates worry that the weight loss comes with a price. Some patients in the clinical trial suffered an increased heart rate and a condition called metabolic acidosis, which can lead to hyperventilation, fatigue and anorexia. Concerns have also been raised about birth defects. One of the ingredients in Qsymia is topiramate, an anti-convulsant that has been linked to birth defects such as cleft lip and cleft palate in babies born to women who have taken it for migraines or seizures. Qsymia's other ingredient is phentermine, an appetite suppressant. ""Our belief is that women will be invited to compelling advertising and marketing messages to experiment on themselves with a drug that has some effectiveness with healthy weight loss but possible serious risks,"" said Cindy Pearson, executive director of the National Women's Health Network. Qsymia's manufacturer, Vivus Inc., says that the drug helped lower blood pressure and cholesterol levels in obese people and that people taking it were less likely to get Type 2 diabetes. Not enough good data to back obesity drug, panel says . ""Obesity is not being adequately addressed by diet and lifestyle changes or currently available therapies,"" the company said. ""The need for new options is urgent, particularly nonsurgical options."" The FDA approved Qsymia only for obese people or for overweight people with a body mass index greater than 27 who also suffer from weight-related conditions like hypertension and diabetes. Doctors are free to prescribe the drug to anyone, however, and there are concerns that physicians will open ""pill mills"" and prescribe Qsymia to people who just want to lose a few pounds. That's what happened in the 1990s with fen-phen, another diet drug combination that includes phentermine. An FDA advisory committee voted against Qsymia's approval in 2010. The panel recommended the drug's approval with a 20-2 vote in February, after Vivus proposed a risk management program to limit Qsymia's distribution and published additional results from one of its three clinical trials. Vivus will at first offer the pill only through mail order, so doctors can't sell it directly, said Dr. Barbara Troupin, Vivus' vice president of scientific communications and risk management. ""There will not be dispensing from doctors' offices,"" she said. ""Seeing that issue and what has happened in fad and diet drugs in the past, that is not a path that we're going to be taking."" The 4,430 overweight and obese patients in the Qsymia studies experienced various levels of weight loss. About half of patients on the recommended dose lost 10% of their weight, while four-fifths lost 5%. That amounts to about 12 pounds for a 227-pound person. Meg Evans, one of the patients, started out at 230 pounds and lost 48 pounds her first year on the drug and another two pounds the second year. ""I loved it,"" she said. ""I wasn't hungry. I almost had to remind myself to eat."" At 5 feet 9 inches tall, Evans, now 63, describes herself as having been ""Twiggy-like"" in college, weighing 120 pounds. Then she gained weight after having four children. An avid cook and eater, she said the drug made it easier to resist tempting foods. FDA advisers recommend diet drug . ""If I saw a chocolate chip cookie, it was easy enough for me to say, 'I'm not really hungry. I can pass on it,' "" Evans said. She said the weight came off gradually, about four pounds a month, and her blood pressure went down almost immediately. Despite the pill's apparent ability to help people lose weight, some critics expressed concerns because of the possible side effects. ""I believe that if the public were to 'buy' (Qsymia) after FDA approval, it would run the risk of severe, even fatal, consequences from another diet lemon,"" Dr. Michael Lauer writes in Annals of Internal Medicine, also noting that the drug led to a slight increase in heart rates. In February, Lauer was one of two FDA advisory committee members who voted against Qsymia's approval. The FDA and Vivus both acknowledge that the three clinical trials meant to measure Qsymia's safety and effectiveness were not designed to properly assess cardiovascular risk. The FDA has required Vivus to do a study on the drug's cardiovascular effects. Vivus said it would be done after the drug's approval. Despite the label's warning that women of childbearing age should use birth control while on Qsymia, there are concerns that women will still get pregnant while on the drug. The FDA recommends a pregnancy test every month while on Qsymia. In the drug-maker's two-year clinical trial, 34 women on Qsymia became pregnant, even though they were told repeatedly to use contraception. No birth defects happened in those pregnancies, according to the company. Previous clinical trials of topiramate, one of the ingredients in Qsymia, have shown a risk of about five birth defects for every 1,000 pregnancies. Comparing the anti-obesity drug to treatments for other chronic diseases, Troupin said patients will probably need to continue taking Qsymia long-term, though the new drug is not expected to be widely covered by health insurance plans. FDA rejects another obesity drug . Evans, the patient who lost 50 pounds on the drug, said she has gained back about 20 pounds since the clinical trial ended two years ago and looks forward to going on Qsymia once it's approved, even though it can have side effects. ""There are side effects to everything,"" she said. She added that the drug wasn't the only reason she lost weight. Weekly counseling on nutrition and exercise were a big factor, too. The counselor helped her change her diet -- choosing a salad for lunch instead of a burger, forgoing pasta and potatoes at dinner -- and encouraged her to walk a few times a week in addition to her regular exercise as goalie in a women's soccer league. ""Before the medicine, I had been telling the girls they'd have to find a new goalie, because I couldn't dive for the ball like I did before,"" she said. ""Then I lost the weight, and I was diving and bouncing back up and having a great old time again.""","Qsymia, formerly known as Qnexa, is second diet drug approved since June .

"(CNN) -- It all started with a simple phone call. But the result, Australian police say, is by far their largest seizure of methamphetamine -- as much as $450 million (438 million Australian dollars) worth of the destructive drug, shipped from southern China and caught in Sydney. Police have arrested three men in the operation -- an Australian, a Singaporean and a Hong Kong citizen -- and say they believe the bust has thrown a major international crime syndicate into disarray. More arrests could follow, they add. The complex operation involved multiple law enforcement agencies and months of monitoring shipments coming into Sydney. But the key to the whole process was a call five months ago from a member of the public in New South Wales to the state's Asian Crime Squad, police said. ""That one phone call was the one thread that allowed us to pull and unravel a syndicate that will be stopped forever,"" New South Wales Police Commissioner Andrew Scipione said at a news conference Thursday. Australian authorities found the drugs in Sydney last week, hidden among bags of chemicals for cleaning products in a container from the southern Chinese trading hub of Shenzhen, according to police. A big haul of 'ice' In total, authorities seized 585 kilograms (more than half a ton) of methamphetamine, also known as ice. That is almost twice as big as their previous record haul of the drug, which took place in July. After confiscating the drugs, police replaced them with an ""inert substance,"" and delivered them to a warehouse in Sydney, said Australian Federal Police Commissioner Tony Negus. Drug lab . According to Negus, the three suspects arrived at the warehouse Wednesday, removed what they thought were the drugs and were then arrested. They have been charged with multiple offenses -- including attempting to possess a commercial quantity of a border-controlled drug -- for which the maximum penalty is life in prison and a fine of 1.275 million Australian dollars. Police say they also found a clandestine drug manufacturing laboratory during the operation. Officials described the bust as an important victory in the fight against the thriving trade of methamphetamine in Australia. ""Make no mistake, this is a hideous, insidious drug,"" Scipione said. ""It's the one drug that we know is so popular across Australia that we need to continue to do all we can to take it out of circulation,"" he added.

"(CNN) -- A fugitive task force in San Diego Tuesday captured a New Jersey man who is suspected in the death of his 2-year-old daughter, authorities said. The FBI had issued a nationwide manhunt for Arthur Eugene Morgan III, who was charged with homicide in Monmouth County, New Jersey. A tip from authorities in New Jersey led investigators to Morgan, the U.S. Marshals said in a statement. ""U.S. Marshals in San Diego received information from New Jersey authorities that Morgan may be staying with friends in East San Diego,"" the statement said. Authorities will request Morgan's transfer to New Jersey to face the homicide charge, Monmouth County Prosecutor Peter E. Warshaw Jr. said in a statement. On November 22, a group of boys discovered the body of Morgan's daughter partly submerged in a stream in Shark River Park in Monmouth County, officials said. She was strapped into her car seat, CNN affiliate WABC reported. The stream runs beneath an overpass, suggesting that the child, Tierra Morgan-Glover, and the car seat were thrown from the overpass, said Assistant Monmouth County Prosecutor Christopher Gramiccioni. Morgan was supposed to return the child to her mother the night of November 21 following a custody visit, Gramiccioni said. When he didn't return the girl, prosecutors in Ocean County charged him the next morning with endangering the welfare of a child and interfering with child custody. The girl was found dead about 20 hours later, WABC reported. ""Although the victim was a small person, our team of investigators is treating this case as if she were one of our own daughters,"" FBI Public Affairs Officer Bryan Travers told CNN.

"(CNN) -- Law enforcement officers in Arkansas on Wednesday night were conducting a manhunt for a pair of suspected robbers who they now believe are likely not fugitives from Arizona. Earlier Wednesday, a U.S. Marshals source said John McCluskey, who escaped from an Arizona prison late last month, and his alleged accomplice, Casslyn Welch, were possibly seen in Gentry, Arkansas, and might have been involved in the robbery of a beauty store. The descriptions of the store robbers and the fugitives ""don't match,"" the Benton County Sheriff's Office said Wednesday night. Supervising Deputy Marshal Rich Tracy of the U.S. Marshals in Arizona said the agency was still trying to determine whether the pair are from Arizona. The suspects in the robbery of the beauty store got away on foot, the source said. Joyce Cook, the owner of Kut and Kurl, told CNN affiliate KNWA that she doesn't believe the robbers were the fugitives. ""The guy kept telling me he was sorry but needed the money,"" said Cook, who had seen artist renderings of how McCluskey and Welch may now appear. ""We're leaning toward more that it is not them [the fugitives] than it is,"" Benton County Sheriff's Office spokesman Doug Gay told CNN. He said Cook's description matches that of a man and woman seen walking on a road between Gentry and Siloam Springs, Arkansas later Wednesday. A passer-by thought it suspicious that a man was wearing a hoodie when it was 100 degrees. Regardless of their identity, Gay said, law enforcement agencies were working through the night to find the man and woman. ""It's an aggressive pair willing to commit a violent crime in the middle of the day."" The two fugitives on the run from Arizona have changed their appearance in recent days, according to the U.S. Marshals office. McCluskey is now believed to have black hair and a black beard, while Welch has dyed her hair blond, according to a bulletin from the marshals' office Wednesday. New photo composites are being prepared to help in the search, it said. Welch's mother lives in Arkansas, said Thomas Henman, supervisory deputy U.S. Marshal in Arizona. The fugitives are first cousins and in a relationship. ""Both of these individuals have been extremely unpredictable,"" said Henman. ""They are contacting the public as little as possible."" Earlier Wednesday, marshals said the search for the couple was focused on western Montana and southwest Canada. Officers at the Montana ports of entry, border patrol agents and their air and marine division were participating in the investigation in cooperation with other federal, state, local, tribal and Canadian authorities, said Mike Milne, spokesman for the U.S. Border Patrol division that handles Montana. The border patrol has stepped up its efforts, and authorities are scrutinizing ports of entry to identify any convicts attempting to leave the United State to enter Canada, Milne said. In addition, Interpol, the world's largest international police organization, which facilitates cross-border police cooperation, is getting involved. At the request of the United States, Interpol has issued an international alert known as an ""orange notice"" for McCluskey and Welch. An Interpol orange notice can be issued by its general secretariat for any act or event that poses a risk to public safety and security around the world, a news release from Interpol said Wednesday. ""The information included in the Interpol alert which has been sent to police around the world will significantly increase the chances that these two dangerous fugitives will be located and captured. Members of the public are urged not to approach them, but instead to immediately report any sightings to their local police,"" Interpol's executive director of police services, Jean-Michel Louboutin, said in a statement. McCluskey and Welch left the Yellowstone National Park area last week, where they initially were hiding after McCluskey and two other men escaped July 30 from an Arizona prison, according to Fidencio Rivera, chief deputy U.S. Marshal for Arizona. The other two men have since been captured.

"BAGHDAD, Iraq (CNN)  -- At least 20 people were killed and 30 wounded in a double suicide bombing Thursday in northern Iraq, an Iraqi Interior Ministry official said. Houses are left in ruins earlier this week after truck bombings in the northern Iraqi village of al-Khazna. Two suicide bombers with explosive vests carried out the attack at a cafe in Sinjar, a town west of Mosul. Later Thursday, two people were killed and 13 were wounded in a motorcycle bombing in a predominantly Shiite neighborhood of southern Baghdad, an Interior Ministry official said. In Sinjar, many townspeople are members of the Yazidi minority, an ancient religious sect that has been the target of previous attacks in Iraq. In August 2007, More than 400 people died and at least 300 were injured when suicide truck bombers struck predominantly Yazidi villages, a series of attacks that rank among the deadliest in Iraq's ongoing violence. The Yazidi sect is a mainly Kurdish minority, an ancient group that worships seven angels, in the form of peacocks, who its followers believe are subordinate to the supreme god who created the universe. Thursday's attack is at least the second this week apparently targeting ethnic minorities in northern Iraq. On Monday, two truck bombs destroyed 32 homes, killing 30 people and burying others in the rubble, officials said. The bombs targeted al-Khazna village, which is inhabited by a Shiite Shabak ethnic group. The village is an area disputed between Kurds and Arabs.

"(CNN) -- A Canadian fugitive is in police custody, nabbed 14 years after and more than 1,600 miles from where authorities say he gunned down a man in cold blood. John Boulachanis, 37, was arrested Thursday in Miami, according to a news release issued Saturday by the U.S. Marshals Service. According to a website run by Quebec's provincial government, in August 1997 Boulachanis and an accomplice lured Robert Tanguay to a sandpit in the Rigaud region in the western part of the province between Montreal and Ottawa. There, Canadian authorities allege that Boulachanis used a .22-caliber firearm and shot Tanguay several times in the head. The victim's body was buried and wasn't discovered until September 2001. The accomplice was eventually arrested, but the primary suspect -- Boulachanis -- remained at large. He was spotted in New Jersey in 2009, the U.S. Marshals Service said in its statement, citing the Surete du Quebec homicide squad. But he fled before he could be definitively identified and arrested. Last April, Canada's Interpol branch requested fresh assistance from their American counterparts, based in Washington, for help in tracking down Boulachanis. Investigators determined a month later that he had eluded capture ""by assembling a complex labyrinth of intentional disinformation, telephone numbers, addresses, financial accounts and postal boxes in Canada and the United States,"" according to the U.S. Marshals statement. The Royal Canadian Mounted Police notes on its website that the 5-foot-9, 155-pound man assumed a host of aliases over the years, including John Athanassopoulos, John Smith, Konstaninos Georgakopolous, John Papas and John Russo. Besides first-degree murder, Boulachanis is accused in Canada of fraud, arson, narcotics trafficking, conspiracy and weapons-related offenses. He is also wanted in Franklin County, Virginia, on a felony fugitive warrant and on three counts of obtaining money under false pretenses. ""The arrest of Boulachanis shows that, no matter how far this fugitive ran, he couldn't escape the coordinated, international effort to apprehend him,"" said Geoff Shank, from the U.S. Marshals Service's investigative division, in a statement.","John Boulachanis, 37, was arrested in Miami, the U.S. Marshals Service says .

"(CNN) -- Americans Elinor Ostrom and Oliver Williamson won the Nobel Prize for economics for work on how community institutions can prevent conflict, the Nobel Committee announced Monday. U.S. professors Elinor Ostrom and Oliver Williamson are joint recipients of the Nobel Prize for economics. Ostrom becomes the first woman to win the prize in its 40-year history. The award was a ""great surprise... I'm still a little bit in shock,"" she said by phone at the news conference announcing the prize. Ostrom, a professor of political science at Indiana University, was praised ""for her analysis of economic governance, especially the commons."" Ostrom's work shows that local communities often manage common resources -- such as woods, lakes and fish stocks -- better on their own than when outside authorities impose rules, the committee said. ""Bureaucrats sometimes do not have the correct information, while citizens and users of resources do,"" she said to explain the significance of her work. The committee highlighted her research on a dam in Nepal as an example, saying her research has moved analysis of nonmarket institutions ""from the fringe of economic analysis to the very center."" Ostrom said she had not yet thought about what she would do with her half of the $1.4 million prize. Williamson, a professor in the graduate school at the University of California, Berkeley, was cited ""for his analysis of economic governance, especially the boundaries of the firm."" Williamson's work examines why large corporations tend to arise -- and why they do not -- based on the cost and complexity of transactions, according to the Nobel committee. ""He has taught us to regard markets, firms, associations, agencies and even households from the perspective of their contribution to the resolution of conflict,"" the panel said. Forbes magazine said, ""He authored 'The Economic Institutions of Capitalism' in 1975, a landmark text of the 'new institutional economics' movement that challenged the idea of firms as simple profit-making machines. He focused on the contracts and transactions that could explain the structure and boundaries of companies."" Williamson did not speak at the announcement ceremony. ""At some fundamental level, they are really both addressing the fundamental issue of how we create human cooperation through the design of appropriate institutions,"" committee member Tore Ellingsen said. ""They want to understand nonmarket institutions. ... Both laureates look at such institutions very much as conflict-resolution mechanisms,"" he said. While the two professors' work has much in common at an ""abstract level,"" their methods are different, Ellingsen said. Ostrom works from case studies to derive general patterns, while Williamson uses theoretical reasoning. The global financial crisis did not affect the committee's deliberations ""that much,"" committee member Beril Holmlund said, noting that Nobel prizes ""tend not to be for work done last year."" The Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences was established in 1968 by the Central Bank of Sweden in memory of Alfred Nobel. It is given by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, which since 1901 has been awarding Nobel Prizes for achievements in physics, chemistry, physiology or medicine, literature and for peace.

"(CNN) -- A man suspected of killing a 1-year-old child in Texas last year is among the U.S. Marshals' most wanted fugitives, the service announced Friday. The federal agency added Simon Lopez, 26, to its ""15 Most Wanted"" list and cautioned the public that he is ""considered armed and extremely violent."" Authorities allege that Lopez strangled and beat his girlfriend's son, Jeremy Silva, while babysitting her two children in November. Lopez contacted Jeremy's aunt on November 23, claiming that the boy wasn't breathing, and dropped him off at her house, according to a statement released by the U.S. Marshals Service. Jeremy was rushed to the hospital, where he was pronounced dead because of blunt-force trauma to his chest. His ribs were broken, and he had severe bruising on his body, the statement said.

"(CNN) -- Two U.S. marshals who were shot while carrying out an arrest warrant in West Virginia are expected to make a full recovery, a spokesman said. A third marshal, Derek Hotsinpiller, was fatally wounded in the incident. Supervisory Deputy U.S. Marshal Alex Neville, 42, was expected to be released from the hospital Thursday. He has been a marshal for 19 years, Jeff Carter said. The other marshal, Deputy U.S. Marshal Wesley ""Fred"" Frederick, 33, was treated and released Wednesday.

"Washington (CNN) -- A half-dozen contract security officers at the federal courthouse where baseball's Roger Clemens was put on trial last month are in trouble with their employer for accepting gifts from Clemens' defense team after the judge declared a mistrial, the U.S. Marshals Service said Thursday. Clemens, under a six-count indictment accusing him of lying to Congress during an investigation of illicit steroid use, may still face a re-trial on those charges. He has pleaded not guilty. U.S. District judge Reggie Walton had declared a mistrial soon after the jury had been seated, when prosecutors introduced testimony he previously ruled inadmissible. After the mistrial, according to the Marshals Service, a number of courthouse security officers employed by a contractor received baseballs autographed by Clemens, reportedly in appreciation of their escorting him through a large mob of media covering the trial. The security company confirmed the gifts, the Marshals Service said. ""These alleged violations did not jeopardize judicial security,"" the Marshals Service said, leaving any discipline up to the contractor that is conducting it own investigation. While no laws were broken, ""It is a violation of the contract for Court Security Officers to accept gifts in connection with official duties,"" according to a policy cited by the Marshals Service. At risk could be a $5 million security contract for the company in place since 2008. In the statement sent to CNN Thursday, the Marshals Service said ""six employees have been identified as being involved in the incident."" The service said the security company has proposed disciplinary actions, ""and those recommendations are being reviewed by the Marshals Service."" The statement did not elaborate on the proposed disciplinary actions. Meantime, the guards remain scheduled for duty, the statement said.","Courthouse guards face possible punishment from their employer for accepting gifts .

"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN)  -- A man suspected of killing his grandmother and setting her body on fire was returned to Los Angeles, California, after being arrested in Mexico, authorities said Wednesday. Joseph Ettima, 25, is suspected of murdering his grandmother and burning her body. Joseph Elias George Ettima, 25, was arrested in the Mexican state of Chiapas on Monday, said Bert Tapia, supervisory deputy for the U.S. Marshal's Pacific Southwest Regional Fugitive Task Force. He was brought back to Los Angeles late Tuesday night. ""He was homeless,"" Tapia said. ""Didn't have much with him, didn't have any identification."" Ettima initially claimed to be from Belize, Tapia said. When authorities were unable to verify that, he then said he was Nigerian. But officials were able to determine he was actually from California, where he was sought in the January 19 death of his 69-year-old grandmother, Emma Hardwick-Street, in the Orange County town of Los Alamitos. After allegedly killing Hardwick-Street, authorities believe Ettima set fire to her body and house to cover up the crime before fleeing. ""The crime is particularly heinous in that two young children were in the home at the time of the murder and witnessed the event,"" according to a U.S. Marshal's statement. Two of Hardwick-Street's grandchildren, ages 8 and 3, were present at the time of her slaying, according to Los Alamitos police. The 8-year-old was Ettima's younger brother, according to the U.S. Marshals wanted poster on Ettima. Police are not releasing how Hardwick-Street died, said Los Alamitos Police Capt. Bruce McAlpine. CNN affiliate KTLA reported she was stabbed. Twelve people were initially displaced by the fire in Hardwick-Street's apartment building, police said. According to the U.S. Marshals' wanted poster on Ettima, the suspect's 8-year-old brother witnessed the slaying. A 3-year-old girl was also present, according to the Orange County Register. Authorities said Ettima had recently been paroled from prison and had ""a long criminal history of violence with weapons."" The history includes robbery, weapons possession, manufacturing of weapons and indecent exposure, according to a February statement from U.S. Marshals. Los Alamitos police asked the U.S. Marshals task force for assistance the day after Hardwick-Street was killed, and the federal authorities put Ettima on their 15 Most Wanted fugitives list in February. U.S. Marshals, working with Los Alamitos police and Mexican authorities, were able to match Ettima's description to that of the man in custody in Mexico, authorities said. In addition to the homicide charge, Ettima was wanted on charges of robbery, arson, child endangerment and parole violation. ""Ettima has a long history of violence, and his latest crime demonstrates a callous disregard for human life that is unimaginable,"" said John F. Clark, director of the U.S. Marshals Service, in the Wednesday statement. ""Capturing him was one of our highest priorities."" Ettima's arrest ""is the first step in bringing justice to the victim and those affected by this brutal crime,"" said Los Alamitos Police Chief Todd Mattern. ""Ettima's capture provides a sense of security to the community and brings closure to the victim's family."" Nearly 110,000 fugitive felons were apprehended last year by U.S. Marshals task forces, nine of them from the agency's 15 Most Wanted List, the statement said. Four were arrested in Mexico.","Joseph Elias George Ettima, 25, was arrested by authorities in Mexico .

"Miami (CNN) -- Severe weather has damaged more than 50 homes in several Florida towns, officials said, and schools in the Florida Keys were canceled Wednesday because of heavy rain and frequent lightning. No serious injuries were reported. Damage assessments were under way in Plantation and Sunrise, Florida, after a suspected tornado swept through south Florida about 10 p.m. Tuesday. At the time, a tornado warning for the area was expiring, said Joel Gordon, battalion chief for the Plantation Fire Department. Gordon said about 25 homes were damaged in Plantation. In Sunrise, another 25 were damaged, with six classified as uninhabitable, according to city spokeswoman Christine Pfeffer. ""You're in your house one minute and the next minute everything is moving, the house has shifted,"" said Laila Najm of Plantation, who was home with her mother and dog when the storm hit. A tree fell on her home, causing the roof to leak, she said, and the house came off its foundation. Windows were broken, debris and standing water littered her porch and the home lacked running water on Wednesday. Her car windows were broken as well. ""We're so used to hurricanes here,"" she said. ""It sounded like a hurricane but a thousand times stronger. But you feel it surrounding you, you can physically feel it coming from one side of you to the other side. All the windows shifted. The house just started moving, shifting up."" Three people sustained minor injuries in Plantation, but none were transported to a hospital, Gordon said. Some gas leaks from propane cylinders were reported, he said, and ""we were able to secure those without any major damage or issues."" National Weather Service personnel were in the area, Pfeffer said. Gordon said numerous trees were downed. ""The biggest thing we're trying to get out to the public is to please stay off the roads,"" he said. ""The roads in this area are very small, they're tight. We have to get big equipment through."" Damage was also reported in Indiantown, about 75 miles north of Plantation. A VFW building was ""completely destroyed,"" with its roof ripped off, said Bill Schobel, spokesman for Martin County Fire and Rescue. The building was unoccupied at the time, he said. No injuries were reported. A barn was also destroyed, and a house next to the VFW was damaged, he said. The homeowner reported ""it sounded like a freight train coming through the house,"" Schobel said. The first call into Martin County Fire and Rescue came in about 9:30 p.m. Tuesday, he said. The region had been under a tornado watch for most of the day, and a tornado warning was issued in the early evening, he said. Monroe County, Florida, which encompasses the Keys, canceled schools Wednesday as bands of thunderstorms with frequent lightning moved through, according to a statement from Sunny Booker, safe school coordinator for the county school district. The National Weather Service issued a flood advisory for the area, the notice said. ""Bands of thunderstorms with frequent lightning are hitting the middle and lower Keys,"" the statement said. ""A secondary cell of storms is moving eastward which is expected to impact all of Monroe County for several hours. The superintendent does not want students at bus stops in standing water with the frequent lightning.""

"KABUL, Afghanistan (CNN) -- At least 16 people were killed, including international soldiers, and 55 were wounded when a car bomb rocked parts of Afghanistan's capital Thursday, authorities said. Italian soldiers stand near their vehicle, destroyed by a car bomb in Kabul, Afghanistan, on Thursday. At least six Italian soldiers were killed and four others were wounded in the blast, Ignazio La Russa, Italy's defense minister said. Ten Afghan civilians were also killed, said Fareed Rayel, an Afghan Ministry of Public Health spokesman. The blast occurred in a mostly residential area near the Supreme Court of Afghanistan in Kabul, a witness said. Ministry of Interior spokesman Zamarai Bashiri said 21 shops, seven vehicles, five motorbikes and three bicycles were damaged in the explosion. The soldiers were traveling on Airport Road in Kabul when they were targeted by a suicide car bomber, the defense minister said. Afghan military ambulances were taking bodies away and at least three U.S. military vehicles were seen driving toward the scene of the blast. In a separate incident, a service member with the NATO-led forces in Afghanistan was killed in southern Afghanistan, military officials said Thursday. The victim died Wednesday after after being struck by a roadside bomb, the International Security Assistance Force said. ""On behalf of the men and women serving with ISAF, I convey my deepest sympathies to the loved ones of this brave soldier,"" said Brigadier-General Eric Tremblay, ISAF spokesman.

"(CNN) -- It wouldn't be an election year without Florida exhibiting its usual despicable efforts to keep residents from voting. After the 2000 debacle where the nation had to contend with hanging chads, ballots not being counted, more lawyering than anyone ever needs to deal with, and finally a U.S. Supreme Court ruling, you would think officials there would do all they can to stay out of the news. But, no. Leave it to the state legislature and Gov. Rick Scott to create another mess that could have easily been avoided. This time, it's the purging of the state's voting rolls in an effort to keep U.S. noncitizens from voting. According to Scott, potentially 182,000 voters on the rolls are noncitizens. Now there is nothing wrong with any state ensuring that those who are eligible to vote are American citizens. But when it comes to Florida, they didn't even take the necessary precautions to ensure that folks who are legal citizens wouldn't be a part of their purge process. The big question is, why now? Why would Florida, with a statewide vote coming up in 90 days, choose now of all times to do this? That's a question the Department of Justice is asking. T. Christian Herren, chief lawyer in the DOJ's voting rights division, wrote a two-page letter to Florida officials asking why they chose to make this move without consulting the feds, an apparent violation of the Voting Rights Act. Civil rights groups are naturally outraged because in 2000 Florida purged thousands from its rolls. Most of them were minority, and a substantial number were law-abiding residents who never should have been stricken. In Miami-Dade County, officials sent 1,500 letters to voters saying they were potentially noncitizens, and nearly one-third of them provided proof that they were indeed Americans. What kind of failure rate is that to be proud of? This action follows the draconian voter suppression law -- supporters call it voter protection -- that was passed by the Florida legislature, which was so ridiculous and punitive that the nonpartisan League of Women Voters and Rock the Vote! chose not to register voters out of fear of amassing substantial fines. A federal judge has ordered Florida to stop enforcing several provisions of that law. It is shameful that Republicans in Florida are concerned with blocking Americans from the ballots out of some ridiculous fear of noncitizens voting. And they should be embarrassed by their actions, which include questioning the citizenship of 91-year-old Bill Internicola, a World War II veteran. Internicola was a medic during the war and earned the Bronze Star in the Battle of the Bulge. He was also bestowed with the Chevalier Legion of Honour by France. But because of Florida's voter purge plan, he got a letter saying he had 30 days to prove he was an American or he would be stricken from the voter rolls. Internicola fought for democracy overseas, only to have partisan hacks question his legitimacy. Scott should have the decency to call Internicola and offer him a personal apology for the insulting letter. The Department of Justice should be aggressive in demanding that Florida, and any other state, isn't taking action that is detrimental to Americans exercising their right to vote. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Roland Martin .","Florida is purging of its voting rolls in an effort to keep U.S. noncitizens from voting .

"(CNN) -- A suspected drug kingpin on the ""15 Most Wanted"" fugitives list has been arrested in Los Angeles, the U.S. Marshals Service announced Thursday. Keith Hasson, 45, was arrested without incident Wednesday at an apartment northwest of downtown Los Angeles, between Burbank and Thousand Oaks, according to a statement from the Marshals Service. He is reputed to have been the leader of a nationwide cocaine and marijuana trafficking ring that operated from 1999 to 2005 and generated more than $20 million in cash and assets, the statement said. Hasson was wanted on a 2005 open indictment from the U.S. District Court in New Mexico for conspiracy to distribute controlled substances, continuing criminal enterprise and conspiracy to launder money, according to the statement. His brother, Anthony Hasson, was convicted in the same case and was sentenced to more than 24 years in prison. Keith Hasson was placed on the most-wanted fugitive list on June 6. His criminal history dates back to 1981 and includes arrests for attempted murder, robbery, assault with a deadly weapon, vehicle theft, burglary and possession with intent to distribute, according to the Marshals Service. He also is wanted for questioning in two gang-related killings. Investigators say they believe Hasson had access to significant financial resources -- as well as far-flung family ties in the Southwest, Southeast and New York -- and was continuing to organize a criminal enterprise. ""Keith Hasson had a long run as a leader of a criminal organization,"" Geoff Shank, acting assistant director of the Investigative Operations Division for the U.S. Marshals Service, said in a written statement.

"(CNN) -- With less than two weeks before the scheduled last day of the Florida legislative session, demonstrators against the state's proposed immigration bills are putting on a full court press. On Monday an estimated 600 people, mostly Hispanic students, farm workers, immigrant families and advocates, boarded buses from Clearwater to the capitol building in Tallahassee where they began a week of scheduled demonstrations against SB 2040 and HB 7089. The bills come as Arizona's immigration law is stuck in a federal appeals court. If passed, Florida's bills would turn ""all local law enforcement into immigration agents,"" the League of United Latin American Citizens said in a written statement. ""With these powers, local police can ask anyone for papers regardless of their status. Just like Sheriff Joe Arpaio does in Arizona,"" the statement said. ""This bill also mandates 'e-verify' for all businesses under the threat of license revocation."" Republican Sen. Anitere Flores proposed one of the bills. ""Senate Bill 2040 in its current form simply seeks to ensure that in a time of such great unemployment, employers are verifying that any new employees hired have proper documentation to work,"" Flores said in an email to CNN. ""Senate Bill 2040 does not deputize police officers, nor does it criminalize immigrants."" She is against an Arizona-style immigration bill, she said. Gov. Rick Scott has indicated that he is in favor of moving along with immigration reform soon, but he has come short of endorsing the proposed bills. HB 7089 would give law enforcement the ability to check the documented status of people under criminal investigation if there is ""reasonable suspicion."" It would also make being undocumented a state crime.

"(CNN)  --  A spokesman for Illinois Sen. Roland Burris resigned Thursday in the wake of new disclosures about requests that Burris raise money for disgraced former Gov. Rod Blagojevich while seeking a U.S. Senate appointment. Sen. Roland Burris, who is under fire to resign, arrives at a Chicago City Club luncheon to speak Wednesday. ""I initially began helping the senator on a temporary basis because he is a long-term friend who I served several years when he was [Illinois] attorney general,"" Jason Erkes said in a written statement to CNN. ""It is now time for me to get back to focusing on ... my newly formed strategic communications business."" The statement did not comment on the new disclosures. A defiant Sen. Burris insisted Wednesday that he was innocent of any wrongdoing in his appointment to President Barack Obama's former Senate seat, as calls for his resignation intensified. The Senate Ethics Committee has launched an investigation in the wake of disclosures that Burris spoke with Rod Blagojevich's brother about possibly raising money for the former governor. The Sangamon County, Illinois, state's attorney is also considering whether to file perjury charges against Burris.  Watch the latest on the chorus for Burris to resign Â» . ""I've done nothing wrong, and I have absolutely nothing to hide,"" Burris said in a speech to the City Club of Chicago. ""You know the real Roland ... Stop the rush to judgment."" Burris told reporters earlier in the week that he informed Blagojevich's brother Robert in November  that it would be inappropriate to raise money because he was interested in a Senate seat. During his testimony under oath in Blagojevich's impeachment trial, however, Burris failed to mention any such conversations when asked about contacts with the governor's office. He later acknowledged that his testimony might be incomplete and filed an affidavit correcting it. Burris said Wednesday that he did not hide his desire to be appointed to the Senate, but never had a conversation about a possible appointment with anyone close to Blagojevich other than the former governor's attorney. He also insisted that nobody from Blagojevich's office contacted him to discuss a potential appointment. iReport.com: Should Burris resign?

"Miami (CNN) -- A Florida sheriff who just arrested 22 men caught in an online undercover operation blames the policies of the Internet sites used by sexual predators. The investigation, dubbed Operation Last House Call, conducted by the Polk County Sheriff's Office, netted 22 men, including a Navy sailor, a software technician with top-secret clearance and a National Guardsman. The sheriff's office says all the men answered online ads placed by undercover detectives. ""These men showed up to our undercover location with gifts and clothing for children, along with condoms and sex toys they planned on using when having sex with the children,"" said Polk County Sheriff Grady Judd. And while Internet sites claim to have security features in place to combat this type of behavior, Judd tells CNN their security measures are insufficient. ""I wonder if the CEO of one of these mega-companies would have the same attitude if these people were preying on their own children. It's all about money,"" he said. The National Center for Missing and Exploited Children works with many of the electronic service providers, including Internet providers and photo storage sites. The center tells CNN that if the Internet sites become aware of child pornography or exploitation on their systems, they are required, by federal law, to report it to law enforcement via the cybertip line, which is operated by the center. From there, the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children refers the call to the appropriate law enforcement agency. ""If they become aware of it, they are required to report it, but it doesn't require them to take additional steps,"" said Michelle Collins, the vice president of the Exploited Children's Division at the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children. ""There's no requirement for them to monitor or look for child pornography,"" she said. However, Collins said, the technological explosion has made companies more proactive. ""Companies are being challenged to think of new and more creative ways to reduce the victimization of children on their services,"" she told CNN. ""There's a lot of progress over the past 10 years ... but much more needs to be done,"" she said. One of those apprehended in Florida was a Navy sailor from Virginia Beach, Virginia, who allegedly came to an undercover location to teach a woman's 11-year-old daughter to have sex in a ""coming of age ceremony."" Another man, from Germantown, Maryland, is a software technician with top-secret clearance for a U.S. government contractor. According to the Sheriff's Office, this man allegedly responded to a fictitious ad hoping to have sex with what he thought was a man's 10-year-old stepdaughter. ""We saw men soliciting our undercover detectives to have sex with children within minutes of initiating online chats with them. Their behavior is despicable,"" Judd said. The operation took place between April 18 and Sunday. Four of the suspects traveled to Florida from Maryland, Virginia, Texas and Missouri. One man, an 18-year-old who allegedly thought he was going to meet a 13-year-old girl was being handcuffed Saturday when he allegedly told detectives, ""My mom's gonna kill me ... and tomorrow's Mother's Day."" The Sheriff's Office says that after suspects answered their ads, they then continued their dialogue via email, online chats and text messages. The suspects agreed to come to Polk County to an undercover location, when they were arrested. Judd says their behavior is horrible, but so is that of the companies, which enable predators to hunt down kids. ""They either don't care or are in total denial, and that really concerns me,"" Judd said. ""It tells me that they have no moral bounds or moral responsibility or are concerned about kids.""","Security measures are weak, Polk County sheriff says .

The bodies of the four were discovered Friday, when police in Austin, Indiana, responded to the home to conduct a welfare check.

""Once in the residence, he saw parts of the home had suffered recent fire damage and also located four deceased persons in the home."" The state police assisted with the investigation, which preliminarily concluded that 30-year-old Amanda Bennett shot the children -- 14-year-old Jasmine Abbott, 9-year-old Katelynn Bennett and 4-year-old Ryan Bennett -- before starting the fire and shooting herself. ""While the investigation remains open until autopsy reports are finalized, indications are this case is a tragic case of murder/suicide that claimed three innocent lives along with the suspect of the murders, Amanda Bennett,"" the police statement said. All four apparently died from gunshot wounds to the head. Amanda Bennett and Katelynn Bennett also suffered smoke inhalation, police said. The family's dog was also shot, but survived and was being treated at a veterinary clinic, authorities said. Jasmine, the teenager, had made references to marital problems between her parents and a possible divorce, friend Karen Barrett told CNN affiliate WDRB. Indiana State Police spokesman Sgt. Jerry Goodin told CNN that authorities examined online content as part of their investigation, including a posting purportedly from Amanda Bennett that blamed her husband, according to WDRB, saying, ""You got what you wanted, no wife and no kids.""

"(CNN) -- A Florida police officer who was shot at by three fugitive siblings said Thursday he was glad the trio was apprehended without any civilian or police casualties. Ryan Edward Dougherty, 21; his sister Lee Grace Dougherty, 29; and half-brother Dylan Dougherty Stanley, 26, were arrested Wednesday on a rural stretch of Colorado highway. On August 2, Zephyrhills, Florida, Police Officer Kevin Widner was shot at from a car occupied by the siblings. Widner wasn't injured, though numerous rounds were fired during a chase that reached up to 100 mph, according to the Pasco County, Florida, Sheriff's Office. ""I look forward to seeing these criminals receive the punishment they are due for putting my life in danger as well as many citizens they showed total disregard for,"" Widner said. Last week, Ryan Dougherty texted, ""There's a time for all of us to die"" after he was sentenced in Florida on a criminal charge, according to a Florida sheriff's office. With that, authorities said the three siblings began a crime spree that included a bank robbery in Georgia and the attempted murder of Widner. ""At first I was like, wow, they're shooting at me,"" Widner said. ""Then I just wanted to catch them before they could hurt anybody."" One bullet struck his car's tire, disabling his vehicle. As a police officer, he had played out scenarios in his head where he was shot at, and his police training helped him through the incident, he said. The Dougherty siblings led Colorado authorities on another chase Wednesday before crashing into a highway guardrail. One brother stayed in the car. Another brother stumbled off through the brush to a couple of nearby businesses, only to be picked up by law enforcement officials after a citizen spotted him, authorities told CNN. The sister, who wrote on her Flickr profile that she liked ""causing mayhem with my siblings,"" tried to reload her automatic pistol, officials said. A police officer shot her in the leg. The three were all taken to a hospital with minor injuries, none of which are believed to be life-threatening, the Pueblo County Sheriff's Office said. Colorado authorities said the trio spent Tuesday night in the San Isabel National Forest about 10 to 12 miles west of Colorado City. The Colorado Springs Gazette quoted a store employee as saying the three apparently purchased a tent at a recreation supply retailer in the city on Tuesday. Their run ended Wednesday morning on Interstate 25 between Colorado City and the town of Walsenburg, authorities said.","Officer Kevin Widner was shot at by the three siblings .

"(CNN) -- Child protective investigators in Florida had ""prior involvement"" with the family of the two children found dead in a canal this month, an official said Tuesday. But the department had not had an open investigation involving the children since 2005, said Elisa Cramer, director of communications for the Florida Department of Children and Families. The bodies of two children -- a brother and sister, ages 10 and 6 -- were found in a south Florida canal last week. They had been stuffed in luggage. The girl's body was found first, after a passer-by alerted police to a duffel bag floating about midway across the canal; the boy's body turned up in a suitcase closer in as investigators combed the banks for evidence, according to police. Police have said that their only suspect in the children's deaths has been taken into custody by federal law enforcement officers on unrelated charges. Clem Beauchamp, the ex-boyfriend of the children's mother, was arrested on a federal firearms charge dating to 2009, according to CNN affiliate WPBF. He has not been charged in connection with the deaths of the children, identified as Jermaine McNeil and Ju'Tyra Allen. The body of a woman who officials believe was the children's mother, Felicia Brown, was found in a landfill in August, police said Friday. She was never reported missing, and the body had not been identified, but authorities made the connection after they began looking for the mother in the wake of the children's bodies being found. Three children who lived with Beauchamp have been placed in licensed care, Cramer said. Citing confidentiality rules, she declined to provide further information on them. The actions of the Florida Department of Children and Families also are being looked at in a separate case, in which 10-year-old twins were found last month in a pest control truck on the side of Interstate 95 in West Palm Beach, Florida. One of the twins, a girl, was dead; her brother was badly injured. The twins' adoptive parents -- Carmen Barahona, 60, and Jorge Barahona, 43 -- have been charged with first-degree murder in the girl's death. The boy was taken to a hospital and treated for severe burns. The parents also each face seven counts of aggravated child abuse and seven counts of child neglect. Days before the twins were found, the Department of Children and Families received tips alleging poor treatment of children at the Barahona household in Miami-Dade County.","Florida's Department of Children and Families says it had ""prior involvement"" with the family .

"(CNN) -- Indiana's state government has discovered $320 million in funds it didn't know it had, money that officials stumbled across while enacting statewide belt-tightening measures. ""Christmas came early,"" Gov. Mitch Daniels said. During a press conference Tuesday, Daniels cited a ""programming omission"" and modernized tax collection processes for unearthing the $320 million in corporate tax revenue. That money had been accumulating since 2007, but hadn't been accounted for in the state's operating budget. Instead, this revenue went unnoticed, as the state worked to get its fiscal house in order. The latter effort has included several deep cuts -- including roughly $320 million in state funding for K-12 education, according to state Sen. John Broden. ""We've lost a whole year of educational opportunities for our children because of this misplaced money,"" Broden, the ranking Democratic member of the state senate's appropriations committee, said in a press release earlier this week. In an open letter to a state budget committee, Broden and other Democrats requested ""an independent audit ... to determine how this significant error occurred and how Indiana citizens can be assured that it will not happen again."" Still, Daniels -- a Republican who served as Office of Management and Budget director under President George W. Bush -- has characterized the discovered money as positive, comparing it a successful move in the classic board game Monopoly. ""As far as I'm concerned, we just drew the community chest card -- collect not $200, but something much more,"" said Daniels, who has been governor since 2004. And Jane Jankowski, a spokeswoman for the governor, said she does not believe the inquiry called for by Broden and others is necessary. ""We know what happened. We know what the problem was and we're correcting it,"" she said Thursday. CNN's Khara Lewin contributed to this report.","Indiana's state government finds $320 million that it didn't know it had .

"(CNN) -- Why wait for the election in November? The political convention host cities are already going head-to-head as part of our Destination USA project pitting rival cities against each other. Tampa, Florida, will host the Republican National Convention August 27-30, while Charlotte, North Carolina, will host the Democratic National Convention September 3-6. In our smackdown's early returns, Charlotte handily won the vote. The North Carolina town earned a definitive victory with 66 percent of the more than 1,900 votes collected in our unscientific poll. More than 2,100 people recommended the story on Facebook and nearly 100 comments were logged on that story. ""Charlotte, to me, is the best of both worlds,"" says commenter Tim Hass, who works in marketing/advertising in North Carolina's largest metropolitan area. ""It's a major city, so I've got all the amenities of city life combined with the slightly slower pace of a smaller town. The weather is perfect for me, there are a lot of tree-lined streets and natural areas, and enough of a foodie culture that you can pretty much find anything you want if you put some effort into it."" The Tampa Bay area lagged behind with more than 660 votes, or 34 percent of the total. About 40 comments were filed, and the story was shared over 350 times on Facebook. That doesn't mean Tampa lovers weren't enthusiastic about their home. ""You have it all here in TB: the hustle and bustle of a large city yet the pure peace of the white sandy beaches and nightly sunsets,"" says iReporter Krista Kleman, a hotel executive. ""What do you love? Well, good luck not finding it here in Tampa Bay."" Both towns clearly have plenty to offer the convention goers who will pack their cities to celebrate their candidates' nominations. Hopefully, they'll also have a bit of local fun. Here are some recommendations from the people who call these politically connected towns home. Winner of the NYC v. LA smackdown . Both cities are blessed with food scenes that make choosing where to go your only conundrum. Hands down, Tampa locals recommend you get reservations at Bern's Steak House. When you head to Bern's, ""make sure you ask to take the tour,"" advises commenter Paula Vann, a resident of nearby St. Petersburg. ""The tour will take you to their impressive wine cellar and then into their kitchen area. They grow their own produce and age their own beef. Also at Bern's, the dessert is an experience in an upstairs part of the restaurant."" Make sure to stop by Ybor City, where there were many recommendations for Carmines and the Columbia Restaurant (the oldest restaurant in Florida). Their menus aren't exclusively Cuban but they are ""the best for authentic Cuban food,"" says iReporter Matthew Eaton, a cigar company employee. Eaton also recommends stopping by King Corona for a Cuban espresso and cigar and taking a stroll down 7th Avenue to see roosters and hens strutting around. Tampa resident and fellow iReporter Eduardo Jany also recommends Datz deli, Ella's Americana Folk Art Cafe, Sophie's French Bakery, Ceviche and Burger 21. Charlotte residents can provide similarly long lists of restaurant recommendations. iReporter and videographer Scott Lazes loves the Common Market, Phat Burrito, Soul Gastrolounge and Harvest Moon Grille. Commenter Joel Thomas says Cabo Fish Taco is one of his favorite restaurants. ""Located in the artsy NoDa area near Uptown, it is an awesome Baja style restaurant with funky decor and amazing cuisine,"" Thomas says. iReporter Ted Boyd, whose day job is to promote the city's South End neighborhood, clearly loves food. A few recommendations from his South End list: Mac's Speed Shop and Sauceman's for BBQ, Price's Chicken Coop, The Liberty, Pike's Old Fashioned Soda Shop and Food Truck Friday (Camden and Park Ave). In Uptown, he also likes the King's Bakery, Rooster's and the new 5 Church. In South Park, he recommends Paco's Tacos & Tequila and Terrace Cafe. iReport: Miami beyond the beaches . The water's the thing in the Tampa Bay area, where miles of sandy beaches and a beautiful riverfront are available for swimming, picnics and play. Tampa resident have their favorites. Medical resident and iReporter Rainy Betts recommends the location for her daughter's third birthday party, Curtis Hixon Waterfront Park on the Hillsborough River. ""We also have the most beautiful Tampa Bay, where large tropical birds fly overhead as your eye moves down the city skyline, or the long stretch on the waterfront lined by multimillion-dollar mansions and green space"" called the Bayshore, Betts says. ""We have Clearwater Beach, probably the busiest of beaches,"" says iReporter Mike Kramer. ""We have Honeymoon Island, Fort DeSoto, Caladesi Island, St. Pete Beach and even smaller beaches like Howard Park in Tarpon Springs."" N.C. lures ""Hunger Games"" fans . Charlotte resident and iReporter Jody Mace likes to recommend free and nearly free events at her website, Charlotte on the Cheap. ""I've celebrated Day of the Dead at Pura Vida Worldly Art in NoDa, listened to a harmonica concert at Amelie's bakery as I sipped coffee, heard some fine storytelling by members of the community at Crossroads Charlotte's 'the Cankerworm"" event,'"" she says. The NoDa neighborhood (named for North Davidson Street) is the place for some Charlotte residents. ""NoDa has some great music at the Evening Muse and the Neighborhood Theatre, amazing pizza at Revolution, and a couple of outstanding new microbrews at the NoDa Brewing Company and Birdsong,"" Tim Hass says. ""One of my favorite areas of town is NoDa, where I often go with a group of friends to see bands or go to a gallery crawl,"" says iReporter Edward, a student who didn't want his last name published. For those with a great sense of adventure and a little more to spend, locals recommend the U.S. National Whitewater Center, where actor Woody Harrelson was known to play during filming of ""The Hunger Games."" The non-profit, a U.S. Olympics training site, also hosts evening events such as flatwater paddle sessions followed by microbrew tastings. What's next in this political battle? Despite the early loss, Florida's boosters aren't giving up so easily. They're already creating lists of recommendations for conventioneers that include diving with the sharks at the Florida Aquarium and feeding the giraffes at Busch Gardens Tampa Bay. In the months leading up to the Republican convention, Florida's tourism bureau will post video and blog recommendations for Tampa Bay convention attendees on its website. Not to be outdone by the Sunshine State, North Carolina already has a three-day ""City of Culture"" Charlotte excursion on its website, and tourism officials are making plans to show off Charlotte to conventioneers come September. They're guessing some politically competitive attendees will enjoy the NASCAR Hall of Fame, Charlotte Motor Speedway and team race shops.

"(CNN) -- Railroad ties, cement pilings and other debris reportedly mark the entrance to Marcus and Partricia Faella's rural Florida compound, situated on the edge of a wildlife management area marketed by tourism officials as a good spot for hikers, campers and bird watchers. Look closer and, according to police documents, you'd see shooting slits cut into the side of the couple's trailer, maybe even some military-grade ordinance scattered around the property. It is there, authorities say, that Marcus, his wife and eight other members of American Front -- a down-on-its-luck white supremacist group -- trained in hand-to-hand combat, drilled in breaking down weapons and practiced shooting them, imagining their targets weren't merely water jugs, but rather the exploding heads of people they hated. On Monday, authorities said they had arrested the Faellas and five other members of the group, which is also known by its initials AF, on charges of illegal paramilitary training, attempting to shoot into an occupied dwelling and evidence of prejudice while committing a crime. ""Faella views himself and the other members of the AF as the protectors of the white race,"" investigators wrote in an affidavit. ""Faella has stated his intent during the race war is to kill Jews, immigrants and other minorities."" More immediately, according to police, Faella was planning to stage provocative disruptions at the Orlando City Hall and at a Melbourne, Florida, anarchist gathering that included members of anti-racist skinhead groups. Faella, the police documents say, wanted to stir up media attention to help gain new recruits for American Front, which hate-tracking groups says has been faltering since the death of its leader, David Lynch, in California. Nationally, American Front has had a long and violent history, including the beating death of a Salt Lake City man and a string of 1993 bombings in California, according to hate-tracking groups. The 25-year-old group enjoyed a resurgence in 2007 under Lynch, described by the Southern Poverty Law Center as a charismatic leader who helped form it in 1987. But Lynch was shot to death in his home in March 2011, leaving the group with no clear leader, according to the Anti-Defamation League. It has shrunk significantly in the past year, according to the Southern Poverty Law Center. Most of the group's 50 or so members appear to live in Florida, according to the ADL. Authorities identified the other members arrested last week as Christopher Brooks, Richard Stockdale, Kent McLellan, Jennifer McGowan, Mark McGowan, Diane Stevens, Paul Jackson and Dustin Perry. Except for Marcus and Patricia Faella, all remained jailed Wednesday. Marcus Faella bonded out of jail on Saturday, according to Osceola County officials. His wife was released on Sunday, they said. According to police, Faella's group watched videos training them in fighting and the use of AK-47s and other weapons at the compound, which the affidavit said is ringed with barbed wire and protected by pit bulls and firing positions facing the driveway. The property was meant to become a refuge for white supremacists after the fall of the U.S. government during a race war, investigators wrote in the affidavit. The group was making body armor and sniper suits and stocking up on supplies in preparation, according to police. On at least one occasion, a group member who also belonged to the National Guard provided training to American Front members that he had learned in the military, according to the affidavit. The arrests came on the heels of a two-year investigation based on the reports of a confidential informant who had to flee the fortified compound on April 28, according to the arrest affidavit. At a meeting to plan the attack on rival skinheads that day, Faella nearly discovered secret recordings the informant had been making of training exercises, according to an affidavit released by police. CNN's Kim Segal contributed to this report.","Ten members of a white supremacist group are facing charges in Florida .

"(CNN) -- Two fires have merged, coming dangerously close to protected areas in Florida's Okefenokee National Wildlife Refuge. The so-called Honey Prairie fire, which has been burning since late April, united with another blaze called the Paxton Road fire Tuesday, the U.S. Forest Service said. Working around the clock, 526 firefighters have been deployed to combat the flames. ""We've got lots of crews out there trying to hold that line, trying to protect that wildlife refuge,"" Forest Service public information officer Haven Cook said. Cook said while the fire is 75% contained, dealing with a fire in swamp can be tricky. ""When we're dealing with a situation like this, the fire can lay down, creep under all that peat, and so when we have significant weather like a wind event, it can spark and develop an active flame front very quickly from there."" The fire reached the eastern edge of Okefenokee Swamp to Chesser Island, a tourist attraction that housed an observation tower and a 4,000-foot boardwalk that stretched out into the middle of the swamp. ""The tower is fine; so is the historic Chesser Island homestead,"" Cook said. ""But the boardwalk did burn; about 90% of it burned."" Florida Gov. Rick Scott declared a state of emergency Monday, citing the ongoing danger of wildfires and drought conditions. Meteorologists say there are moderately good chances for rain toward the end of the week, but thunderstorms may also be in the forecast. ""This fire can go on for weeks until we get a good drenching rain,"" Cook said. ""The firefighters are going to be monitoring this and watching this for two, maybe three weeks because it's been such a dry year.""","NEW: Florida Gov. Rick Scott declares a state of emergency .

"(CNN) -- Spawning at least 24 possible tornadoes, mostly in the Midwest, a giant storm system stretched Tuesday night from Alabama to Maryland, bringing new watches and warnings. The system unleashed its wrath on several communities in northern Alabama, Tennessee and North Carolina on Tuesday night. At one time, it had stretched a staggering 1,200 miles from north to south. Tornado watches were in effect for several counties near Charlotte, North Carolina, and forecasters say some areas will see continued strong winds Wednesday. In Lincoln County, North Carolina, five homes were damaged and two of them destroyed, said spokesman Dion Burleson. Five people were hurt; one has life-threatening injuries. Several cars were overturned in Catawba County, according to the National Weather Service. In Chattanooga, Tennessee, a possible tornado struck a fence near Chickamauga Dam and threw debris into a roadway, police said. Seven cars lost control and crashed, with five people suffering injuries. Deputies were assessing damage near the town of Geraldine in DeKalb County, Alabama, and in Marshall County, said Lauree Ashcom, spokeswoman for the Alabama Emergency Management Agency. Marshall includes the lake resort city of Guntersville. A tornado may have touched down southwest of Geraldine, she said. Downed trees are making it difficult to reach residents and determine any injuries, said DeKalb County emergency official Michael Leath. ""We're having to batten down the hatches for another system coming in."" No injuries had been reported late Tuesday. A tornado watch was in effect for the District of Columbia until 3 a.m. ET Wednesday. Wind, rather than flooding, appeared to be the biggest danger, with gusts exceeding 70 mph in some places. The National Weather Service's Storm Prediction Center said there were 258 reports of wind damage by mid-evening Tuesday. No deaths had been reported to state emergency officials by early evening. Extensive damage from the high winds and possible tornadoes was reported in a band from Minnesota to the Gulf Coast. Six tornadoes were confirmed in Indiana, three in Ohio and another in Wisconsin. Up to 200,000 residents lost electrical power. A tornado smashed into a business in LaPorte County, Indiana. Dan Hill, general manager of Hoosier Machinery Solutions, heard a weather siren and went to check. He turned to another employee after spying an odd cloud formation outside the business door. "" 'Does that look like a tornado?' I asked. As soon as I said that, it touched down."" The twister tore a roof off a pole barn, damaged some reconditioned recycling equipment and employees cars. No one was hurt. The 10 employees ""all ran for [heavy] equipment and got inside,"" Hill told CNN. All 48 floors of the Chase Tower in downtown Indianapolis were evacuated for a short time at the height of the storm. People took refuge in the building's fallout shelter, according to CNN affiliate WRTV. The system appears to have made weather history. Preliminary readings indicate that a new record was set for the lowest pressure in a nontropical storm in the mainland United States, said Chris Vaccaro of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. The minimum central pressure of 28.22 inches of mercury was equivalent to the pressure of a major Category 3 hurricane, without the corresponding wind scale, he said. If confirmed, the reading would break the current record of 28.28 inches, set on January 26, 1978, during what became known as the Blizzard of 1978. Storms caused extensive damage to buildings near Racine, Wisconsin, and Peotone, Illinois, Tuesday morning. A Peotone youth who was with his brother at a farm that was damaged described to CNN affiliate WLS-TV in Chicago what it was like in the middle of the tempest. ""All of a sudden, the wind kicked up,"" Justin Schroeder said. He said the force of the wind ""sent us back into the foyer about five feet. It was like a bomb went off. You didn't hear a tornado. You didn't hear a whistle. It was a like an explosion of glass."" Some experts told WLS that the storms might be the most powerful to hit Illinois in more than 70 years. The CNN Severe Weather Center reported the storm was moving quickly eastward at more than 50 mph. The Minneapolis/St. Paul Airport reduced air traffic from three runways to one runway for landings and takeoffs Tuesday mid-afternoon because of high winds. About 50 flights had been canceled or delayed, a spokesman said. Conditions may still be difficult in the region Wednesday. O'Hare International Airport in Chicago reported that 500 flights had been canceled as of 3:35 p.m. Some delays were reported at Chicago Midway Airport. Indianapolis International Airport reported some delays for flights to Detroit, Michigan; Milwaukee, Wisconsin; Cleveland, Ohio; and Minneapolis, Minnesota, while Detroit Metro Airport said most flights were on time with the most significant delays to O'Hare. Indiana and Illinois each had at least 60,000 power outages and 38,000 were reported in Ohio. Other states reported smaller figures. Gabrielle Torres and her husband experienced extreme weather in Corydon, Indiana. ""There were extremely strong winds that were even rocking my husband's semi-truck side to side,"" she said. ""The tornado sirens were sounding but we could barely hear them over the pounding rain."" In St. Louis, Missouri, two reported partial building collapses were blamed on the extreme weather, according to Officer Donna Wisdom of the St. Louis Police Department. Video from CNN affiliate KSDK-TV in St. Louis showed downed trees, damage to homes and thick rubble on a sidewalk beside a building damaged in the storm. Wisdom said no serious injuries were reported from the partial collapses. A National Weather Service damage assessment team confirmed that an tornado touched down near Somers, Wisconsin, causing two injuries. Numerous uprooted trees, snapped and downed power poles and roof damage to several buildings was reported. Several parked tractor-trailers were also tipped over, according to the National Weather Service. Severe thunderstorm warnings and tornado watches popped up throughout central Kentucky, Ohio and Tennessee around midday Tuesday as the intense band of storms began to push through Indiana. At least one tornado was reported to have severely damaged a house in Howard County, northeast of Kokomo, according to CNN affiliate WRTV in Indianapolis. Witnesses gave accounts that underscored the fury of the storm. Several said they'd never seen anything like it. CNN iReporter Trey Sturgeon, 23, of Connersville, Indiana, described the wind and rain as ""a little bit scary."" ""Where I live in Indiana, we don't get winds and possible tornadoes,"" said Sturgeon, a musician who was at home when he looked out the window to see the storm. ""The first thing I thought of was my family,"" he said. ""When the winds came, it was a lot more like a dense fog than rain -- from the wind pushing the rain sideways,"" he said. ""On a tree right down the road, a big tree limb was broken off and it blew across the street before it hit the ground, and we're talking maybe a 200-, 250-pound tree limb. There were reports on my police scanner of tree limbs falling and landing on power lines in the northern part of the county."" All 48 floors of the Chase Tower in downtown Indianapolis were evacuated briefly at the height of the storm, and occupants took refuge in the building's fallout shelter, WRTV reported. ""It was pretty bad up there,"" Nick Hoetmer, who works in the building, told WRTV. ""The windows were moving back and forth, so it was nasty.""

"(CNN) -- U.S. agencies have warned some employees that reading the classified State Department documents released by WikiLeaks puts them at risk of losing their jobs. But what about students considering jobs with the federal government? Do they jeopardize their chances by reading WikiLeaks? It's a gray area, said law professors and national security experts who spoke with CNN. The topic has been debated intensely in the past week in legal and academic circles, ever since several U.S. universities sent e-mails to students with warnings about reading leaked documents. They say students ought to be mindful of their future careers when commenting on or distributing the documents online -- especially those planning to seek jobs in national security or the intelligence community, which require a security clearance. ""The security clearance asks whether or not you're a risk when it comes to sensitive material. This could be one indicator that, when taken together with others, creates a broader pattern that might suggest you're not a person to be hired,"" said Pepperdine University law professor Gregory McNeal, who specializes in national security law. ""They may very well take into account your opinion, as a job candidate, whether or not you think WikiLeaks is a good thing or bad thing for the country,"" he said. ""It's a small issue, but one to approach with caution if I were a student seeking a job in the national security field."" E-mails went out last week to students at several schools, including Boston University's School of Law, Georgetown University's School of Foreign Service and Columbia University's School of International and Public Affairs, cautioning students against commenting on or posting links to the documents on social media sites such as Facebook or Twitter. Each message came from the schools' offices of career services, claiming to be sent at the recommendation of an alumnus. In the eyes of the federal government, the documents remain classified, ""thus, reading them, passing them on, commenting on them may be seen as a violation of Executive Order 13526, Classified National Security Information,"" said Maura Kelly, Boston University law assistant dean for career development and public services, in an e-mail to students. ""Two big factors in hiring for many federal government positions are determining if the applicants have good judgment and if they know how to deal with confidential/classified information,"" Kelly said in the memo, which was posted on the law blog ""Above The Law"" last week. A Boston University spokeswoman confirmed that the e-mail had been sent, adding that students are ""free to make their own choices."" ""Our Dean of Career Development and Public Service thought it prudent to alert our students to the possible ramifications of dealing with classified information, especially in light of the fact that law graduates often apply for jobs that require security clearances,"" Mary K. Gallagher said in an e-mail. So, can just reading about the leaked documents in the media jeopardize your chances of getting a job with the federal government? Probably not, said McNeal. But commenting on them online or distributing them might create a pattern of behavior that raises red flags during screening for the highest levels of security clearance, which often require polygraph tests. ""I don't think looking at them alone could hurt anyone. The problem is when you're looking and then supporting and endorsing, then you start running into trouble. That's where you run the risk of jeopardizing the security clearance on character grounds,"" he said. It also serves as a reminder to be mindful of your ""online and personal profile,"" your virtual footprint of statements, comments and shared materials stored in the web's collective consciousness, the professor said. ""When you're up against so many others for the same competitive job, you don't want to stand out for this. Prudence would dictate, don't add another possible reason for them to ding you."" Nor should the school's warnings necessarily be construed as policy endorsement, said Harvard Law School professor Jonathan Zittrain, co-founder of the school's Berkman Center for Internet & Society. ""I imagine the distribution of these warnings is less to endorse the policy and more just to say, 'Hey this is what we're hearing.' This is not like advising students to not smoke pot. It's not weighing in on a matter of policy. It's just telling them that it might affect them down the road,"" he said. But to the government agency hiring you, there could be a big difference between just reading about the documents in the news and actively disseminating them or seeking them out in their full form on WikiLeaks' site. ""It's a new situation, and the documents are so ubiquitous right now that it seems weird to worry who on the margin has ever posted a link to them. But at the same time, the initial release was against the law, so I can't begrudge the government, when figuring out who to employ or trust with secrets, to ask if you helped to further spread documents that belonged to the government."" After the issue went viral last week on ""Above The Law"" and ""the Arabist,"" which posted an e-mail to students at Columbia University's School of International and Public Affairs, the blogosphere lit up with comments from readers calling the practice unconstitutional and a violation of free speech rights. Many suggested the warning was over the top and added another layer of anxiety for job-seekers in a weak job market. An unscientific survey on ""Above The Law"" asked readers what they thought: 55% said the warnings were needlessly scaring law students, 38% said a little over the top but a prudent thing to consider in a difficult job market and 9% said spot on, even reading the stuff could get you in trouble. But would it be illegal for the State Department to deny anyone a job based on statements about WikiLeaks? The answer is unclear, but in the private sector, inquiries from prospective employers about your ability to handle confidential material would be considered ""legitimate business concerns,"" labor lawyer Camille Olson said. ""The framework of the issue goes back to whether the employer has a legitimate concern about your fitness for the position,"" said Olson, a Chicago-based attorney who has represented large employers, including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and The Society for Human Resource Management. ""I can understand how an employer in the federal government would believe that someone who once engaged in that kind of conduct, with the understanding that the information was confidential, how that reflects upon their potential for handling confidential info in the future."" The e-mail from Columbia University's School of International and Public Affairs told students that posting links or making comments about the documents online would ""call into question your ability to deal with confidential information, which is part of most positions with the federal government."" On Monday, the school issued a follow-up, saying that said it supported students' right to ""discuss and debate any information in the public arena that they deem relevant to their studies or to their roles as global citizens"" without fear of consequences. ""OCS e-mailed this cautionary suggestion to students, as it has done many times with other information that could be helpful in seeking employment after graduation. We know that many students share a great deal about their lives online and that employers may use that information when evaluating their candidacy,"" Dean John H. Coatsworth said in a statement. ""Should the U.S. Department of State issue any guidelines relating to the WikiLeaks documents for prospective employees, SIPA will make them available immediately."" The U.S. government's position on WikiLeaks has been clear since November 28, when the site began posting anonymously leaked U.S. State Department documents. The Obama administration has condemned the disclosures, arguing that they harm U.S. diplomacy by exposing confidential communications. The site has been kicked off servers in the United States and France and lost a major revenue source on Friday when the U.S.-based PayPal cut off its account. The White House Office of Management and Budget also sent a memo forbidding unauthorized federal government employees and contractors from accessing the classified documents on the WikiLeaks site or other websites on government or personal computers. The memo, sent to federal workers and contractors without official federal government authorization to read the documents, said that just because the documents have been published on the internet does not change their ""classified status"" or ""automatically result in declassification."" ""Classified information, whether or not already posted on public websites or disclosed to the media, remains classified, and must be treated as such by federal employees and contractors, until it is declassified by an appropriate U.S. Government authority,"" the memo said. What's less clear is the government's official position on whether potential recruits should avoid WikiLeaks. A spokeswoman for the Office of Management and Budget would not comment on the issue. But a look at the Standard Form 86 -- the questionnaire all applicants for national security positions must fill out -- sheds light on the risks the government wants to avoid. Questions related to past associations, such as have you ever ""knowingly engaged in activities designed to overthrow the U.S. Government by force"" or ""engaged in acts of terrorism"" are intended to evaluate whether you could pose a security risk, said McNeal, the Pepperdine law professor. The big concern for universities, which are supposed to be incubators for lively debate and the exchange of ideas, is the chilling effect the warnings may have, said Zittrain, the Harvard professor. ""I would hate to see the policy extended so broadly that you have students scared to read newspapers,"" Zittrain said. ""What I hope no one would want to do is ask if you read an article about the documents and hold that against you.

"(CNN) -- A Florida man apologized Tuesday for boarding his daughter's school bus earlier this month and threatening the other children and the driver, saying he acted out of frustration over students bullying his daughter. ""I handled it the wrong way when I went on the bus,"" James Jones said. He said he does not condone storming on the bus or his profanity-laced tirade in front of students. ""I really strongly believe we should do it a different way,"" he said. ""But at that time, in the heat of the moment, I did it the wrong way."" He urged parents not to follow his example, but to use available resources and talk to the school if their child is being bullied. Jones was arrested a week after the incident, said attorney Natalie Jackson, who accompanied him at a news conference Tuesday. He is facing two misdemeanor charges of disorderly conduct and disturbing a school function, according to CNN affiliate WESH. Jones, of Lake Mary, Florida, and his wife claim they had attempted to talk to school officials about the bullying of their daughter. The Seminole County School District, in a statement released last week, denied that the couple had reported the bullying and said his actions were ""not acceptable behavior,"" according to CNN affiliate Central Florida News 13. The district said one incident Jones alleged had happened on the bus actually involved another student, not his daughter, and that incident was investigated and ""appropriate action taken,"" according to the station. Jones addressed that Tuesday, saying a condom was thrown at another student, but went past his daughter, who found ""something wet"" on her hair. The girl was told by someone else that a boy had spit in her hair, he said. But he said the girl also has been called names and pushed around. Jones said he found his daughter had been avoiding the bullying by skipping school. She would hide in bushes to avoid the school bus and return home while her parents were at work, he said. The girl has cerebral palsy, according to Central Florida News 13. The girl's mother, Deborah McFadden-Jones, drove her to school in the days before the incident, Jackson said Tuesday, but could not that day, September 3, because she had a funeral to attend. The girl refused to go to school, she said, and her father said he would drive her to the bus stop and talk to those involved. But before the bus arrived, the girl began crying, and told her father about specific bullying incidents, Jones said. He said he was frustrated because she was so upset, and ""snapped."" His intention was, ""I was going to be a dad and I was going to at least talk to the bus driver and find out what was going on with my daughter,"" he said. He said he had received numerous messages of support from other parents, but wanted to dissuade them from doing something similar. Jackson said Jones held Tuesday's news conference because he wanted to draw attention to national anti-bullying organizations like the National Center for Bully Prevention, and to National Bullying Prevention Month, in October. ""It's not about me. It's about kids that are getting bullied going to school,"" he said, adding that his actions were ""out of character."" He admitted that by launching into the profanity-laced tirade, he was acting as a bully. ""I thought I was backed up against the wall as a parent,"" he said. ""We definitely don't want to promote that."" At the time, Jones said the incident had upset his daughter so much that she had to be hospitalized. He said she was still in the hospital Tuesday. She will not be returning to that school, he said, adding he is looking into what to do next. McFadden-Jones said her daughter was attempting to stand up for other bullying victims when ""it turned on her and there was no one to help her. ... She felt alone."" She said she had noticed her daughter keeping to herself more. ""She wasn't involved with the family like she normally would be on a regular basis,"" McFadden-Jones said. She said when she drove her daughter to school before the incident, she asked to speak with a guidance counselor but was told the counselor was not available. She asked for the counselor's phone number and called from the parking lot ""and I let them know I needed to talk to her about my daughter."" No one responded, she said. Jones encouraged parents to talk to their children about the situation at school. ""Get involved in your kid's life,"" he said.","James Jones: ""I did it the wrong way""

"(CNN) -- In June, Imam Feisal Abdul Rauf, the man behind the proposed ground zero mosque, was asked on live radio if he believed Hamas is a terrorist organization. This isn't a difficult question: Hamas employs suicide bombers and fires incendiary rockets at civilian targets within Israel. It calls for the destruction of the Jewish state followed by the establishment of a potentially fundamentalist and repressive regime. Governments all over the world, including the United States and the European Union, rightfully consider Hamas to be a terrorist organization that willfully and indiscriminately targets innocent civilians. Yet Imam Rauf, after being asked this simple, straightforward question, refused to state whether or not he believed Hamas to be a terrorist organization. He said: ""I will not allow anybody to put me in a position where I am seen by any party in the world as an adversary or as an enemy."" Now Imam Rauf wants to build and lead a $100 million, 13-story community center and mosque. It would be constructed on property currently occupied by a historic 150-year-old building that was seriously damaged by the landing gear of one of the hijacked jetliners that flew into the World Trade Center on September 11, 2001, and he wants to unveil it on September 11, 2011. I oppose the center and mosque's construction because I believe there should be an investigation into the sources of its funding. The main group behind its construction, The Cordoba Initiative, which is headed by the Imam, is a registered charity in New York state. It is the responsibility of New York's Attorney General Andrew Cuomo to ensure the mosque's funding is coming from reputable sources. The radio show comments were not the first time Imam Rauf has said troubling things or been associated with troubling activities. On CBS' ""60 Minutes,"" less than a month after the attacks, he said American policies were an ""accessory"" to the crime of 9/11. ""In fact,"" he added, ""in the most direct sense, Osama bin Laden is made in the USA."" Imam Rauf is also listed on the website of the Perdana Global Peace Organization as a ""role player and contributor."" This group was a financial backer of the Gaza flotilla, which attempted in May to break the Israeli's blockade of Gaza. The Cordoba Initiative has reported less than $20,000 in assets. Where the $100 million for his project would come from is anybody's guess. Furthermore, it's fair to ask why, exactly, Imam Rauf has insisted on building the mosque so close to ground zero, and why he wants to unveil it on the 10th anniversary of the attacks. This not an issue of religious freedom, but rather, a question of safety and security. New Yorkers deserve to be safe and to feel safe, and we have a right to know who's footing the bill for Imam Rauf's project. Are foreign governments or other organizations involved? And why is there such secrecy about the source of the money? The Cordoba Initiative is legally required to file disclosure reports with the office of the attorney general, and it could easily be asked under state law to open its books for the office if Cuomo would simply make that request. We need to know who is paying for the center and mosque. We need to know what their motives are, and we need to know if the Imam is promising any potential benefactors anything in return for their support. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Rick Lazio.","Rick Lazio says the Imam behind the planned Islamic Center refused to call Hamas terrorist .

"(CNN) -- ""For architects, perfection is necessary,"" said Japanese architect Kengo Kuma. ""It is my mission to use the kindness and delicateness that old architecture had. I believe that this mission is not easy to complete. So I am planning to work until I fall down."" With nearly 60 projects on the go across the world, Kuma's search for perfection is all consuming; he rarely takes a day off from work and sometimes even finished projects are analyzed and amended. The 55-year-old from Tokyo has become synonymous with delicate simplicity and sensitivity to a building's surrounding. From the Great (Bamboo) Wall House located near the Great Wall of China outside of Beijing to the Suntory Museum of Art in Tokyo, Kuma has employed natural materials that complement a building's location to great acclaim. View the gallery of Kuma's spectacular buildings . ""I try to catch the atmosphere of the place where we build the house. We try to find out how the people live there and what kind of materials they use. After we find out the atmosphere of the place, we will think how we can relate that with the architecture."" Using mostly glass and Chinese bamboo to make the house by the Great Wall, it comfortably blended into the natural surroundings, but the Suntory Museum of Art, completed in 2007 presented different challenges. ""Usually, a building in a massive developed area tends to be a sad building. However, I wanted to make a building which is warm and could feel a human's touch. To make that ideal building, I used natural material such as Japanese paper and paulownia [wood]. I wanted to take back the human element even if the building was inside the city."" Much of modern architecture is often unfairly portrayed as lacking that human element, but Kuma's focus on retrieving and remaining Japanese traditions in architecture has gone some way to dispel that myth. It is a far cry from his initial architectural fascination with concrete, in part inspired by the Olympic stadium designed by Kenzo Tange for the 1964 Games in Tokyo. ""I learned that architecture can impress people. If the Olympics were not held in Tokyo, I might not have become an architect,"" he told CNN. If Tange's buildings for the Olympics were responsible for sparking Kuma's imagination, he's followed a different path in his career. After earning a master's degree in architecture from The University of Tokyo in 1979 and further study at Columbia University in New York, he returned to Japan in 1986 -- a boom time for architects. ""People who were only about 30-years-old could design a building. It was an era of post-modernism and a lot of young people were making outstanding buildings during that time."" But the economic recession hit Japan in 1992 and it had a profound impact on Kuma's life and changed his attitude to architecture. ""I didn't have a job in Tokyo for 10 years. I was designing small buildings in the countryside. I worked with a craftsman and studied how to use natural materials in those 10 years. From this experience, I learned the great aspects of Japanese traditional architecture. I started to design traditional Japanese architecture and foreign people took notice of the design,"" he said. ""I think the cities of Japan are a bit damaged by the concrete buildings,"" Kuma added. ""Because of the sub-prime issue and now another economic crisis, I feel this is again a good opportunity for architects to design buildings slowly."" In focusing taking a more holistic approach to his craft, Kuma has promoted the humanizing elements of architecture and its ability of improve people's lives. It's an approach that he has likened to making sushi. ""There are two important things to make sushi. One is the material and the other is the skill... For sushi, both the power of the material and skill is important and their balance is very important. ""I believe that this balance is what people want,"" Kuma continued. ""People and society are seeking the thing like sushi for the architecture and their city. A variety of people are interested in Japanese architecture and traditions and this is parallel to why sushi is popular in Western country.""","Japanese architect has popularized sensitive Japanese traditions in buildings .

"(CNN) -- Massive global greenhouse gas pollution is changing the chemistry of the world's oceans so much that scientists now predict it could severely damage shellfish populations and the nations that depend on the harvests if significant action isn't taken. A new study from the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution in Massachusetts shows that ocean acidification is becoming a very serious problem. The study was published in July online in the journal Fish and Fisheries. ""What the study found was that in the next 10 to 50 years many countries are going to see impacts, particularly countries that are heavily reliant on clams and oysters and mussels, and will not be able to adapt by shifting to other foods or aquaculture methods,"" said Jackie Savitz, senior scientist and chief strategist for the international ocean conservation and advocacy organization Oceana. Ocean acidification, or the changing chemical make-up of seawater, has occurred since the industrial revolution as ocean waters absorbed too much carbon dioxide. Carbon dioxide is a by-product of human industrial activities, mainly the burning of fossil fuels. The Woods Hole study found that many marine animals like mollusks and corals that build hard shells and skeletons are most at risk from this. Those countries directly impacted are mostly poor and developing nations that are heavily dependent on shellfish as main sources for protein, like Senegal, Madagascar and Haiti. But the research also suggests damage caused by ocean acidification could ripple across economies around the world. It's already blamed for economic losses at oyster farms in the Pacific Northwest and the slowing of coral growth in Australia's Great Barrier Reef, according to Oceana. ""The truth is, if you look at all the effects of ocean acidification, nobody really gets off the hook,"" Savitz told CNN Radio. ""Impacts on coral reefs, for example, that can affect tourism, that can affect fisheries because fish depend on coral reefs. And when you look at those impacts, what you find is, in many cases, it's the developed countries, like the United States, the U.K. and other European countries that will be impacted."" Even though this current study by Woods Hole found that ocean acidification is likely to have the worst impact on poor and developing nations first, it's a problem with widespread impact. ""If you look at Somalia, where industrial fishing has fished out Somalian waters and the local fishermen can't get food anymore, what do they do?"" Savitz said. ""They turn to piracy. Who does that affect? That affects anybody with a ship that's going through those waters. They've taken a lot of different ships hostage. So, ultimately, food insecurity can become a national security issue."" Savitz also said, ""If all these countries are going to have food insecurities because their clams or oysters are no longer available or because their fisheries are no longer available as a result of climate change, that could put pressure on other countries and it can affect all of us."" Savitz and her organization Oceana are urging more support for a clean energy sector, something the Obama administration has been pushing and trying to develop for several years, and an end to taxpayer subsidies for fossil fuel industries. CNN's Ninette Sosa and Barbara Hall contributed to this report.","Woods Hole research says poor nations would suffer first .

"(CNN) -- Imagine a woman dying under a rain of stones while buried in the ground to the top of her breasts. Imagine faceless figures throwing stones at her. Imagine her last thoughts, wishes and dreams. Imagine her hoping to magically survive this brutal punishment. Imagine her children watching her bleed and moan as people throw stones with ignorance and cruelty. Imagine this nightmare taking place under the present-day laws of a country. Imagine a country where lawyers, journalists, human rights and women's rights advocates who courageously speak out against unjust laws often face grave consequences such as detention or exile. Sakineh Mohammadi Ashtiani , a 43-year-old woman, had been sentenced to be stoned -- although after an international outcry, Iran has issued a statement saying she will not be punished in that way. Over the past 31 years, many have suffered such inhumane punishment in Iran. With the establishment of the Islamic Republic in 1979, Islamic fundamentalism took over the laws of the country. Consequently, women and the right to their bodies became the focus of the Islamic laws in Iran. In other words, fundamentalist rulers of Iran have claimed as their own, the inherent right of a woman to her body. The Islamic Penal Code of Iran specifies stoning as the punishment for a married woman or man found guilty of adultery. And legislators set ruthless conditions for carrying out the stoning, including that the pebbles used should be big enough to kill the victim, but not so large that they kill him/her too quickly. As a lawyer and women's rights advocate who practiced law in the Islamic Republic for 22 years, I have worked on numerous stoning cases. Once during my career I took a risk and personally approached a young cleric who was the judge of one of my stoning cases and asked, ""Don't you think this cruel and inhumane law of stoning should be changed?"" The young judge looked at me with compassion and pity and said, ""Sister, don't you utter this statement somewhere else! Stoning is a verdict set by God. The earthly human cannot change a verdict set by God."" I never understood how the merciful God who is said to have created the humankind would treat its creatures with such a degree of malice. In a situation where people are enslaved by ruthless laws, human rights and women's rights advocates began to ask for help from the international community. Each time someone is sentenced to stoning, human rights and women's rights advocates coordinate efforts to remind the world of the unjust laws in Iran. They remind the world that a form of corporal punishment as severe as stoning is the denial of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, or ICCPR, to which Iran is a signatory. In fact, Article 6(2) of ICCPR explicitly states that the death sentence is to be imposed only for the most serious crimes. Not only does Iran not abide by this article, it continues to issue stoning orders as a sign of obstinacy against the people of Iran -- who never witnessed a single case of stoning in modern times before the Islamic Revolution of 1979 -- and the international community. In spite of the efforts of human rights and women's rights advocates to raise awareness about the systematic and comprehensive violations of human rights in Iran, stoning remains a legitimate punishment for adultery in the Islamic Penal Code. One of the critical challenges that further facilitates the violations of human rights in Iran is that the international community is mainly focused on the nation's nuclear program rather than the human rights situation. The world owes to the Sakinehs of Iran a reconsideration of its priorities in regard to the Islamic Republic. The time has come for the international community to seriously hold it accountable for the unacceptable violations of human rights against its citizens. People and organizations in the United States and other nations should make it their explicit goal to work toward spreading the word about what goes on in Iran, condemning it in international forums and supporting those Iranians who, inside or abroad, try to speak out against these violations. What we hope to see is that the human rights situation becomes a top priority of U.S. diplomatic work towards eventual negotiations with Iran. For as long as the world neglects the human rights situation in Iran, more women and men will have to face their horrifying destiny, as determined by unjust laws, all alone. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the co-authors.","After international protests, Iran issued a statement saying a woman would not be stoned to death .

"(CNN) -- In the six months since the repeal of the U.S. military's ""don't ask, don't tell"" policy, many of the most prestigious military institutions in the country are adding a student group to their club rosters that they had never seen before: gay pride groups. For nearly 17 years, gay and lesbian soldiers were expected to deny their sexuality under threat of dismissal as part of ""don't ask, don't tell."" With the repeal of the rule on September 20, 2011, a new era began for homosexual members of the armed forces. But what about the young cadets preparing to enter their ranks, studying in the nation's top military academies? In December, a group of students at the U.S. Coast Guard Academy in New London, Connecticut, formed a group called the Spectrum Diversity Council, to serve as a gay-straight alliance on campus. The night before ""don't ask, don't tell"" ended, cadets at Norwich University, the nation's oldest private military academy, held the first meeting of the school's Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, Questioning and Allies Club. These clubs are school-sanctioned, and their numbers are growing, according to cadets and school officials. Even at the United States Military Academy at West Point, cadets are forming their own Spectrum student group. As one of the nation's five federal service academies, The U.S. Coast Guard Academy follows the same rules as the U.S. military, and up until recently this meant ""don't ask, don't tell"" was a rule. Even before the repeal, First Class Cadets Kelli Normoyle and Chip Hall were among students at the academy who met with school officials to discuss what might happen if ""don't ask, don't tell"" were repealed. ""No one was allowed to 'come out' in the DADT Working Group,"" Normoyle said, but it was an unspoken secret that many of the members of the group were gay. Today, Normoyle and Hall are co-leaders of the Spectrum Diversity Council that boasts 60 to 65 members. They say the experience of going to the academy is one they would never trade, but they acknowledge that life is different since the repeal. ""It's hard to separate the personal changes from 18 to 21 (years old), but the repeal of DADT was less like flipping a switch. It wasn't like one day I'm hiding my sexuality and denying who I am and the next I'm out and proud. It was more like a continuum; I progressed through my own comfort with being gay,"" Hall said. ""I had come out to friends my senior year in high school and wasn't sure if I was ready to live under DADT,"" Normoyle said. After a year at another school, she decided to go to the Coast Guard Academy after all. ""I knew the Coast Guard was what I wanted to do. I knew I wanted to go to the service academy. I wanted to show people that it didn't matter if I was gay; I could just do my job and make friends. I thought I would put my personal life in the back seat."" She found this easier said than done. ""I felt separated from my friends having to hide something that big, a part of my life,"" she said. ""We have an honor code at the school, and you practically had to lie to people when they asked if you're dating anybody, if you had a boyfriend."" Normoyle and Hall say the Coast Guard Academy administration has been very encouraging of their club, with Rear Adm. Sandra L. Stosz, the first female superintendent of the academy, a major supporter from the beginning, according to Hall. Other cadets have been welcoming, too, Normoyle said. ""We've had nothing but positive experiences with our classmates. We had some people coming up and telling us they grew up having negative stereotypes of gay people, but said, 'I know you two, I respect both of you, I'm trying to break those stereotypes.' "" From March 30 to April 4, the Coast Guard Academy will host Eclipse week, a tradition dating back 37 years to one of the first African-American cadet groups on campus. The week has turned into a diversity week of sorts, according to Hall. He said Spectrum plans to host a roundtable discussion with active-duty members of the Coast Guard on homosexuality in the service. Hall and Normoyle received their orders last week and will graduate as full members of the Coast Guard at the end of the school year. Norwich University, established in 1819, is a small but well-known private military college in Northfield, Vermont. As a private school, Norwich never had an official policy discriminating against gay cadets, but since the majority of students accept commissions in the military, ""don't ask, don't tell"" was always a presence. ""Prior to repeal, the facts of DADT served to keep any LGBTQA student quiet,"" said Daphne Larkin, a spokeswoman for the university. Dr. M.E. Kabay, a professor at Norwich University, is the faculty adviser to the Norwich Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, Questioning and Allies Club. He described how on the last night of ""don't ask, don't tell,"" cadets met in the school library for the first meeting of the club. Cadet organizer Josh Fontanez raised all the blinds of the club to symbolize openness to the community. ""Right from the beginning, the intention was to be open, and that's what has happened,"" Kabay said. The LGBTQA group at Norwich has even collaborated with a group called Christian Fellowship to foster discussions and understanding, he said. Fontanez knew he wanted to be in the military for most of his life, even if it meant hiding his sexuality. ""The military has always been a passion of mine. I knew I wanted to be in the military before I knew what sexual orientation was,"" he said. ""It was a sacrifice I, like so many men and women for generations before me, was willing to make. We love our country enough to put our personal lives on hold."" He believes that understanding and leadership are part of life at Norwich, and one reason he helped form the LGBTQA club. ""I know I'm going to be a leader in the armed forces when I leave here,"" he said. ""Norwich teaches us when you see something not right, fix it. That's what we did."" From March 26 through March 31, the Norwich LGBTQA group hosted what is thought to be the first ""Spirit Week"" on a U.S. military academy campus. The week was full of activities, workshops and discussions focused on anti-bullying, harassment and collaboration. There were HIV screenings, films on acceptance and stereotypes, and even an event called ""the condom olympics,"" which highlighted the importance of safe sex and distributed prophylactics. ""No matter how you identify yourself -- straight, gay, lesbian, transgender, man, woman or whatever -- you could learn something that can help you whether here at Norwich or out in the world,"" Fontanez said. ""Over the next week or next month, we will reflect on the activities, and I have no doubt we will see Norwich as a better place than it was a week ago."" Fontanez said turnout for pride week has been good, with up to 150 people at some events. The week culminates in a ""Queer Prom"" on Saturday night, consisting of a social that the head of the university and the governor of Vermont will attend, followed by a dance where same-sex couples will obviously be accepted. ""All these events have an ulterior motive: to show that gay people are people,"" Kabay said. ""For some students, this is going to be an eye-opener. Maybe what they've been told doesn't fit."" At the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, the cadets are still getting their group officially approved. ""The primary purpose of clubs is beneficial to the cadet experience and beneficial to the West Point goal of graduating cadets,"" said Col. Charles A. Stafford, West Point chief of staff. ""We want to graduate leaders who can go into any culture in any part of the world,"" he said, ""having the ability to speak with a diverse group of people and work effectively with different cultures."" The West Point club is also called Spectrum and is based on the Coast Guard Academy club. With its approval still pending with the commandant, Stafford says cadets would welcome it. ""As we prepared for the repeal of DADT, we underestimated the level of respect and acceptance of the younger generation, and we see that in our cadets today. It is not an issue for the vast majority,"" he said. On Saturday, a West Point alumni group called Knights Out will host a dinner at The West Point Officers Club. ""While policies have changed so events like this are possible, I think attitudes have been changing for a long time,"" said Knights Out founder Sue Fulton, who was among the first women to graduate from the academy in 1980. ""I do think it is always tough for young gay and lesbian people to be up front about their lives, but as long as gays and lesbians are invisible, some people will harbor prejudice,"" she said. The dinner will celebrate the repeal of ""don't ask, don't tell"" and the formation of Spectrum at West Point, and it will include cadets, alumni and others, according to Fulton. Representatives from The Citadel, the U.S. Naval Academy and The Virginia Military institute told CNN they have not been approached with formal requests to start LGBT clubs at their school, but if the momentum started by cadets at other institutions is any indication, it is only a matter of time before they do. As Stuart Mackenis, a spokesman for Virginia Military Institute, said, ""We have the diversity the whole world has. We don't have a club now, be we could soon.""","After repeal of ""don't ask, don't tell"" policy, cadets are reaching out, forming alliances .

"This summer, as ""Grease"" returns to theaters in sing-a-long form (it's being billed as ""the original high school musical""), and the surprisingly unstoppable ""Step Up"" series releases its third installment (in 3-D, no less), it's clear: Films that feature dance are bigger than ever. Accordingly, we've compiled a list of some of the best dance scenes ever shown on-screen. Grease . Pollyanna-ish Sandy needn't have bothered with her bad-girl makeover: She'd already won Danny's heart. But we love the way Olivia Newton-John and John Travolta's tight, black, ""greaser"" duds contrast with their super-sunny singing and dancing in this 1978 musical's fun finale. InStyle.com: See all the memorable dance scenes . Funny Face . In the 1957 musical, Audrey Hepburn played an amateur philosopher turned reluctant fashion model (opposite dance legend Fred Astaire). The beatnik black ensemble she wore for a scene in which she broke out into a Bohemian-style routine is still chic; the sequence was repurposed by Gap in a 2006 ad for ""skinny black pants."" Step Up . Channing Tatum and Jenna Dewan worked as professional dancers prior to being cast in this 2006 sleeper hit; their expert moves (and, as seen here, ultra-realistic rehearsal gear) were a big reason for the film's unexpected success. (Their obvious chemistry -- they started dating as soon filming wrapped and married last summer -- didn't hurt either.) InStyle.com: See SYTYCD host Cat Deeley's exclusive style diary . Chicago . In 2002, RenÃ©e Zellweger, Catherine Zeta-Jones and Richard Gere starred in this Hollywood version of the popular musical. The film's critical and commercial success paved the way for subsequent stage-to-screen adaptations like Rent, Phantom of the Opera, Dreamgirls, Hairspray, and even Mamma Mia. (And didn't RenÃ©e look divine as 1920's-era murderess/aspiring showgirl Roxie Hart?) InStyle.com: RenÃ©e Zellweger's transformation . Flashdance . This 1983 movie about an eighteen-year-old steel worker/aspiring dancer was responsible for the slashing of a million sweatshirts; the insouciant off-the-shoulder style worn by actress Jennifer Beals is still popular. (The scene in which she douses herself, mid-dance, with a bucketful of water, is just as difficult to forget.) Saturday Night Fever . John Travolta went from sitcom star to big-screen sensation after this movie's 1977 release. His white three-piece suit and impossibly smooth moves combined with a best-selling soundtrack by the Bee Gees made disco more popular than ever. InStyle.com:The 21 most iconic swimsuits ever . Center Stage . Starring a mix of little-known young actors -- like future Avatar star Zoe Saldana--and professional ballet dancers, this 2000 film followed students at a fictional New York City dance school. There was a run on red toe shoes after star Amanda Schull donned them for the high-energy workshop scene (in which she twirled to a pop soundtrack of Michael Jackson and Jamiroquai). Footloose . A much-delayed remake is scheduled to debut in 2011, but we're not sure it's possible to improve on the 1984 original -- we particularly like the scene in which small-town transplant Ren McCormack (Kevin Bacon) dances his troubles away in an empty warehouse.

"Happy Valley, Oregon (CNN) -- For three days, Clackamas Town Center has been a crime scene. On Friday, it will be a shopping mall, once again. Yet the Oregon shopping center's scheduled 9 a.m. reopening -- announced on its Facebook page -- does not close the books on the many questions tied to Tuesday's fatal shooting. Investigators have identified Jacob Tyler Roberts, 22, as the man responsible for the bloodshed and panic at the mall, located in the community of Happy Valley, about 10 miles southeast of Portland. Remembering the victims . Wearing a load-bearing vest and hockey mask, Roberts used a semi-automatic rifle to shoot three people on the mall's second floor, killing two of them, according to authorities. He then ran down a corridor and back hallway that led downstairs. It was there, police say, that Roberts took his own life with a gunshot to the head. The one shooting victim who didn't die of her injuries, Kristina Shevchenko, remained in Oregon Health & Science University Hospital on Thursday. The 15-year-old suffered a collapsed right lung and injuries to her liver after being shot in the chest, Dr. Laszlo Kiraly told reporters Wednesday. She was in serious condition Thursday, as she had been the day before, said Todd Murphy, a spokesman for the Portland hospital. Authorities haven't offered more insights publicly, meanwhile, into the man they say shot Shevchenko, 54-year-old Cindy Ann Yuille and 45-year-old Steven Mathew Forsyth. Yuille died of a single shot to the back, and Forsyth of one shot to his head, Oregon Deputy Medical Examiner Chris Young said Thursday in a news release. No motive has been given to explain why Roberts did what he did. On his Facebook page, Roberts describes himself as a ""pretty funny person that takes sarcasm to the max."" The central image is a ""Follow Your Dreams"" slogan painted on a wall and stamped ""Cancelled"" in red -- a work by famed street artist Banksy. The woman who raised Roberts after his mother died of cancer when he was 2 described him as ""fun and caring"" and a ""totally cool dude."" Choking back tears, she called Tuesday's shooting ""completely out of character"" and apologized for the pain and panic Roberts had caused. ""Never could I imagine him being part of something like this,"" Tami Roberts, his biological aunt -- though she referred to herself as his mother -- told CNN affiliate KPTV. ""What Jake did was wrong but, as his mother, he will always be in my heart. I love him very much."" The woman described the suspected gunman as fun-loving and adventurous while growing up. Roberts planned to ""be a hero"" and join the Marines, Tami Roberts said. But that dream was dashed when he broke his foot at age 17, and ""he lost purpose."" The two hadn't spoken in about four years, after they had a ""falling out ... because he didn't want to get up and look for a job ... and he got really depressed and he got really angry."" After that, Tami Roberts said she thought of him daily and still loved him deeply -- even though she can't explain his actions. ""Every day of my whole life, I was proud of him,"" she said. ""I'm just not proud of him right now."" Staffers at Oregon City High School, where Roberts helped out in the school's counseling department before his graduation, are trying to come to grips with what happened. ""I found him to be a very polite young man, soft-spoken, nice smile,"" said Arnold Bunting, a counseling department staffer. ""And I'm just really surprised that somebody with his personality would end up doing something like this."" The Oregon Department of Justice is offering ""to help pay for at least 10 counseling sessions"" for those rattled by Tuesday's shooting. In its post announcing stores will reopen Friday, Clackamas Town Center stressed it won't forget all those affected by the violence -- from Yuille, Forsyth and Shevchenko to the scores of others who saw their holiday shopping devolve into chaos. A candlelight vigil is planned for 7 p.m. Friday at a mall entrance. ""Please continue to keep the victims, their families and the entire community in your prayers during this difficult time,"" the mall said. CNN's Dan Simon reported on this story from Oregon, and Greg Botelho reported and wrote from Atlanta.

"(CNN) -- Barcelona announced an internal investigation Tuesday after reports in Spain claimed that the club had commissioned detective agencies to spy on a number of their star players. The Catalan giants confirmed on their official website that the club spent a total of 3.1 million euros ($4.04 million) on ""espionage"" between 2008 and 2010. The money went to the now defunct Metodo 3 agency and another company called the Intelligence Bureau and Cyber Experience. Barcelona said that ""legal action will be taken to preserve the image of the club, the privacy of its employees and the legacy of the institution."" Spokeman Toni Freixa added: ""FC Barcelona wants to know 'who was spied on and why.' "" The alleged activities took place under the presidency of Joan Laporta, who was at the helm from 2003-2010, one of the most successful spells for the famous Spanish club. Current president Sandro Rosell, a fierce critic of Laporta, succeeded him in June 2010, winning 60% of a vote among Barcelona club members. The relationship between the two has remained cool since Rosell was elected, but on the pitch under former coach Pep Guardiola and his successor Tito Vilanova, the triumphs have continued. Reports on the Spanish website El Confidencial, claimed Metodo 3 trailed defender Gerard Pique and his pop star wife Shakira in 2010 -- following them to a concert to log their activities. Former stars Samuel Eto'o and Brazil's Ronaldinho were also believed to have been monitored in the past. Blog: Will Guardiola return to Barcelona? The allegations come as Barcelona has suffered a mini slump in form, twice losing to rivals Real Madrid and having to cope with the absence of Vilanova, who is battling cancer. Rosell told the official website that the board had ""absolute confidence"" in Vilanova and were supporting him as he undergoes chemotherapy and radiotherapy in New York. ""His recovery is our priority and I'd consider this season a success if he fully recovers from his illness. He will not leave even if it costs us every single title. ""He's encouraged, and he's eager to return."" A tentative return date of the end of March has been set by the Spanish league leaders, who are trailing AC Milan 2-0 from the away leg of their Champions League last 16 tie, another disappointing recent defeat. ""In the event that Barca defeat AC Milan, the manager could be on the bench for the away leg of the Champions League quarter finals,"" Rosell told gathered reporters.","Barcelona confirms it spent $4 million on ""espionage"" from 2008-2010 .

"(CNN) -- An environmentally-friendly surfboard has taken to the waves after five years in development. Surf's up: Mark Harris tries out the Eden eco-surfboard. British profession surfer Mark ""Egor"" Harris was one of the first to try the British-made board at Fistral beach in Cornwall, England, giving its performance and eco-credentials the thumbs up. ""It felt good and I can see these boards being popular with surfers. We spend a lot of time on the beach and in the sea and surfers have been campaigning to clean up the oceans for years. This board goes hand-in-hand with that philosophy,"" said Harris. The surfboard has been in development in the south west of England for five years and is the culmination of a collaboration between the Eden Project gardens and biosphere and three local companies. Chris Hines, former sustainability director of the Eden Project and a lifelong surfer and committed environmentalist came up with the idea for the board when a balsa tree had to be taken down in the rainforest biome. ""I said, well, let's make a completely sustainable surfboard, because I knew people who could laminate in hemp cloth and plant-based resin, so we went for it. It was a eureka moment: we thought, let's really have a go, let's really see what we can do,"" he told CNN. Hines and the Eden Project team soon realized that balsa and hemp cloth were too heavy for commercially viable surfboards, but desire remained to produce a surfboard that reduces the reliance on petroleum chemicals and uses more sustainable materials. The Eden team worked with local company Homeblown to create a new type of foam core for the eco-board, 15 to 20 percent of which is made from plant derived material. Another local Cornish company, Sustainable Composites, developed a resin made almost entirely from linseed oil instead of oil-derived coatings, meaning over 50 percent of the final finished surfboards are made from renewable materials. Completing the use of local companies, the boards are being manufactured by surfboard shapers, Laminations. Junior British surfing champion Tassy Swallow is set to compete at the International Surfing Association World Junior Championships in Ecuador on a new Eden surfboard. ""It's a really good board, it worked really well,"" said Swallow after her first outing on the board. ""It feels a lot more buoyant in the nose which makes it easier to catch waves. It will really catch on when people realize that it's as good as a regular board.""","New eco-surfboard made with over 50 percent renewable materials .

"(CNN) -- Psychedelic album covers. Break-dancing music videos. Rockers with mullet haircuts. George Harrison in 1971 during one of two concerts he staged at Madison Square Garden in New York to bring attention to the plight of the Bangladeshi people. Now there soon may be another entry added to the list of obsolete pop music trends: the all-star, mega-benefit concert. Remember the days of Live Aid and last year's Live Earth concert? Those events may be going the way of chain record stores. Music industry insiders say that big-name benefit concerts are being pushed aside by the rise of the Internet. ""The days of Live Aid and the Concert for Bangladesh are becoming relics of the past,"" says Keith Clifton, an associate professor of musicology at Central Michigan University in Mount Pleasant, Michigan. ""It wouldn't surprise me that one day we could have YouTube charity events being broadcast on the Web."" When the music industry celebrates the Grammy Awards Sunday night, one of the night's subplots will be the Internet's troubling impact on record sales. Few have paid attention to another trend: more musicians are going online rather than onstage for their charitable work. The  English rock group Radiohead recently made news when members decided to sell their music directly to their fans. Musicians are going online with their favorite charities for a similar reason  -- they want to appeal directly to their fan base, music commentators say. Popular artists such as Madonna, R&B pianist John Legend and country singer Clay Walker are leading the way. Each prominently promotes their favorite charity through their official Web site. ""It's not that we don't see the power in some of the bigger concerts,"" says David Murphy, a bassist for STS9, an ""electronic jam band"" from Santa Cruz, California, that highlights 14 charities on its Web site. Watch STS9 talk about their music Â» . ""But we feel that there's more power and change for ourselves when we have some direct contact with the charities we're working with."" There's also less chance for bad press. Benefit concerts can backfire. Several have drawn more bad press than good, says Clifton, the music critic. ""The biggest criticism is that the money earned does not make it to the people who need it,"" he says. Some musicians try to sidestep that criticism by creating their own charity instead of allowing concert organizers to pick one for them. Walker, the country music singer, created a charity called BAMS (Band Against MS) after he was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis in 1996. Walker, who has four platinum-selling albums, says he was inspired to take more control over his charitable endeavors after hearing complaints about some concerts to benefit victms of the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. ""I was hearing these families who had lost loved ones in 9/11 say, 'Where's the money?' "" Walker says. ""That raised a red flag."" Rock band 3 Doors Down says it made good business and moral sense to form their own charity. The Mississippi band created The Better Life Foundation to raise money for children and young adults with special needs. ""If you donate to a charity, who knows what the charity is going to be known for,"" says guitarist Chris Henderson. ""With the Better Life Foundation, we have 100 percent control."" Despite their imprint on popular culture, there was never a golden age for benefit concerts. They attracted criticism from the very beginning. One of the first massive benefit concerts was the 1971 Concert for Bangladesh. The concert was organized by Beatles guitarist George Harrison to raise money for refugees in the South Asian country. The Madison Square Garden concert was a musical success. It featured an all-star lineup of musicians, including Bob Dylan, Eric Clapton and Billy Preston. One of the most memorable images from the concert came when the late Preston, dubbed the ""Fifth Beatle,"" became so carried away by the music that he began dancing on stage. But the organizers weren't dancing off-stage. According to the Associated Press and Time magazine, allegations over missing funds surfaced. The IRS and lawyers had to be called in to resolve disputes. Other problems cropped up in subsequent benefit concerts. Rachel Weingarten, a pop culture critic and a co-producer of benefit concerts, says some of the concerts eventually became known as ""Ego-Fests"" because of the back-stage demands of some performers. Critics wondered if some benefit participants were feeding their egos more than needy people. The legendary record producer Quincy Jones reputedly warned performers before the ""We Are the World"" recording session to ""check your egos at the door."" Benefit concert critics also said that some performers were using human misery to bolster their own image. ""You'd have musicians tearing up hotel rooms and their agent says, 'You know what? Let's get you some brownie points,' "" Weingarten says. The last major benefit concert, Live Earth, couldn't escape bad publicity either. The event was a series of global concerts designed to raise awareness of global warming. But the concerts gained plenty of attention for back-stage drama. Critics said the logistics and private jet travel required to stage the concerts damaged the environment more than helping it. One dubbed the concerts ""Private Jets for Climate Change."" Others accused organizer Nobel Peace Prize winner Al Gore of staging the event as a promotional vehicle for a planned presidential run. The event's worldwide television ratings tanked. Benefit concerts are now rich subjects for parody. Two animated shows, ""South Park"" and ""The Simpsons,"" have skewered them. Still, the impulse that drove musicians to first stage the Concert for Bangladesh more than 30 years ago remains. It's now normal for bands to join with charities. STS9, the electronic jam band from California, appears to devote as much energy to giving back as playing music. The group organizes food drives, registers voters and donates portions of its concert proceeds to charities. The group even splits up its charitable donations among local, national and international groups. David Murphy, the group's bassist, says his band wants to inspire people through their giving as much as their music. ""We're poor musicians, but we do what we can,"" he says. ""We're trying to as much as we can so that everyone will jump on that train."" E-mail to a friend .","The Internet is changing the way musicians use charities .

"London (CNN) -- A lawyer for numerous alleged victims of phone hacking by journalists has confirmed that he plans to launch legal action in the United States against media mogul Rupert Murdoch's News Corp. Mark Lewis told CNN Friday he expects an initial hearing to be held in New York in about two to three months, as he seeks to begin legal claims in the United States. This summer's scandal around claims of phone hacking by journalists working for the now-defunct News of the World -- run by News International, the British arm of News Corp. -- rocked public confidence in the media, police and politicians. Police in London are now investigating the hacking claims as well as allegations of bribery of police. Senior News Corp. executives have denied that wrongdoing among the company's staff was widespread. Separately, former News of the World editor Andy Coulson has filed a lawsuit against News Corp., his lawyer, Jo Rickards, confirmed to CNN Friday. Rickards did not give elaborate on the subject of the lawsuit. Coulson, who resigned as editor when two News of the World employees were jailed for hacking royal voice mail in 2007, went on to work as Prime Minister David Cameron's spokesman, but resigned when the police launched their new phone-hacking investigation in January this year. He denies knowledge of wrongdoing while he was editor. He is among a dozen people to have been arrested and released on bail by police investigating claims that many celebrities, politicians and victims of crime had their phones hacked. Lewis' clients include the family of Milly Dowler, a missing teenager whose voice mail was allegedly hacked before she was found murdered. Public outrage over the allegations led News International to shut down News of the World in July. ""We have been speaking to U.S. lawyers to make applications to U.S. courts in order to assist the investigation of this matter and are looking to pursue legal action on the basis of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act in the United States, whereby a holding company can be liable for practices outside the jurisdiction where the offence is said to have taken place,"" Lewis said. ""Proceedings will be issued in the U.S. where we will seek information from the company's directors about those issues and about corporate governance."" This action was being pursued ""because it is in our clients' interests to pursue their cases as thoroughly and properly as possible,"" Lewis said. He added that ""compensation is likely to be higher from U.S. courts than courts in the UK."" John Kelly, a lawyer at Schillings law firm, which represents Steve Coogan and other suspected celebrity hacking victims, told CNN its clients have not yet joined the lawsuit against News Corp. in the United States but are interested in the idea. Another lawyer for a number of alleged hacking victims, Mark Thomson, told CNN his clients were pursuing claims in the English civil courts but did not intend to take action in U.S. courts. Earlier this week, a News International statement confirmed it was involved in ""advanced negotiations with the Dowler family regarding their compensation settlement.""

"(CNN) -- The father of Sandy Hook Elementary School shooter Adam Lanza claimed his body last week, a family spokesman said. Peter Lanza claimed the body Thursday, spokesman Errol Cockfield said. He declined to specify where the body would be buried. On December 14, Adam Lanza, 20, took guns belonging to his mother, Nancy, and shot her as she slept in her bed. Then he went to the school in Newtown, Connecticut, where he gunned down 20 children and six staff members before killing himself. Interactive: Remembering the victims . It was one of the worst mass shootings in U.S. history. Peter Lanza was questioned by authorities after the shooting, as was the gunman's 24-year-old brother, Ryan. Authorities have offered few details about Adam Lanza. He had no known criminal record, authorities have said. A relative told investigators that the gunman had a form of autism, according to a law enforcement official, who spoke under condition of anonymity because of the sensitive nature of the investigation. CNN has not been able to confirm independently whether he was diagnosed with autism or Asperger's syndrome, a higher-functioning form of autism. Opinion: Leave autism out of mass shootings . Geneticists are now studying Adam Lanza's DNA, a spokeswoman for the University of Connecticut Health Center said last week. The geneticists were asked to join the investigation by the state medical examiner's office, spokeswoman Carolyn Pennington told CNN. She said that there is no specific genetic marker the team is looking for, and that lab results and a complete analysis of the DNA ""are not expected for several weeks ... probably the end of January."" While experts agree that there are genetic components to many mental illnesses, there are hundreds, perhaps thousands, of genes involved. Most believe that no single gene or mutation alone could foretell violent acts like those committed by Adam Lanza. After the school massacre, Peter Lanza released a statement saying that his family is ""grieving along with all those who have been affected by this enormous tragedy."" ""Our hearts go out to the families and friends who lost loved ones and to all those who were injured,"" the father said. ""We are in a state of disbelief and trying to find whatever answers we can.

"London (CNN) -- The mother of missing British girl Madeleine McCann felt ""totally violated"" when she saw her diary had been published in the News of the World newspaper, she told an inquiry into British press practices and ethics Wednesday. ""I'd written these words at a most desperate time of my life,"" Kate McCann said, saying the newspaper had shown ""no respect .... for me as a mother or human."" The publication of Kate McCann's diary came after the editor of the now-defunct newspaper, Colin Myler, verbally beat her and her husband, Gerry, ""into submission"" to make them do an interview with the newspaper, Gerry McCann said. He and his wife, Kate, were testifying Wednesday before the British government-backed inquiry into phone hacking and police bribery by the press. Tabloid newspapers published articles suggesting the parents were responsible for their daughter's death, Gerry McCann said, forcing them to sue to demand retractions. ""We could only assume they were acting for profit,"" he said of the newspapers, adding the articles had no basis in fact. Their daughter has never been found. Most of the inquiry's attention has focused on newspapers owned by Rupert Murdoch's News Corp., but the McCanns described their troubles with other newspapers, including the Daily Mail and the Evening Standard, which are not News Corp. titles. News Corp. announced Wednesday that Rupert Murdoch's son James had stepped down in September from the boards of subsidiaries that publish The Sun, The Times and The Sunday Times. He remains chairman of News International, the News Corp. subsidiary that owns all three newspapers. The McCanns are the latest high-profile figures to give evidence to what's known as the Leveson Inquiry, following actor Hugh Grant and comedian Steve Coogan. Madeleine McCann and her parents have been regular fodder for Britain's tabloid press since the 4-year-old disappeared more than four years ago from a resort in Portugal while her parents dined at a nearby restaurant. The parents of another British girl who disappeared testified Monday how phone hacking on behalf of News of the World newspaper had given their family false hope their daughter was still alive. Milly Dowler's mother, Sally, described her joy at finding that voice mails had been deleted from her missing daughter's phone: ""She's checked her voice mail, Bob! She's alive!"" In fact, the messages had been deleted by a private investigator working for the News of the World newspaper, Dowler's father, Bob, told the inquiry panel. Milly Dowler had already been murdered. Sally Dowler's face fell as she recalled finding out it was the hacker, not her daughter, who had been checking the voice mail. The best-selling Sunday tabloid News of the World was shut down in July after the revelation that it had hacked into Milly Dowler's voice mail. Grant called the hacking of a murdered schoolgirl's messages ""cowardly and shocking."" The British actor also accused newspapers of using criminals as paparazzi and the Mail on Sunday of hacking into his voice mail. Grant said he could not think of any other source for a Mail on Sunday story about his relationship with his then-girlfriend Jemima Khan being on the rocks because of his phone flirtation with a ""plummy-voiced Englishwoman."" That story was later found false and libelous in court. Grant's accusation widened the scope of the British newspaper phone-hacking scandal, which has focused mostly on Murdoch-owned titles so far. The Mail on Sunday is not a Murdoch newspaper. Grant also implied the police were leaking stories about celebrities to the press, saying that when he called the police about his girlfriend being mugged, paparazzi showed up before the police. Police investigating phone hacking by journalists say that about 5,800 people, including celebrities, crime victims, politicians and members of the royal family, were targets of phone hacking by journalists in search of stories. The practice involves illegally eavesdropping on voice mail by entering a PIN to access messages remotely.","NEW: Kate McCann says a tabloid showed no respect for her ""as a mother or human""

"London (CNN) -- Four current and former employees of Britain's Sun newspaper were arrested by authorities investigating claims of inappropriate payments to police, News Corp. and police said Saturday. Police searched the men's homes as well as the East London offices of News International, the News Corp. subsidiary that publishes the Sun and other U.K. newspapers, London's Metropolitan Police Service said. A 29-year-old police officer was also arrested Saturday at the central London police station where he works, police said, on suspicion of corruption, misconduct in a public office and conspiracy in relation to both offenses. He works for the force's Territorial Policing command. Three of the men were arrested at their homes -- two of them, aged 49 and 57, in the county of Essex, and one aged 48 in London. A fourth, aged 42, was arrested at an east London police station. By late Saturday, police said that all five men were subsequently released after posting bail. The current and past newspaper employees were all set to ""return pending further inquiries"" in April or May, according to the Scotland Yard statement. Earlier, they'd been questioned on suspicion of corruption, aiding and abetting misconduct in a public office, and conspiracy in relation to those offenses. The operation ""relates to suspected payments to police officers and is not about seeking journalists to reveal confidential sources in relation to information that has been obtained legitimately,"" an earlier police statement said. News Corp. said it is cooperating with the search of its News International offices. Police said the operation was the result of information provided to police by News Corporation's Management and Standards Committee (MSC), which was set up to look into conduct at News International, a subsidiary of News Corp. The News Corp. statement said the company had ""made a commitment last summer that unacceptable news gathering practices by individuals in the past would not be repeated."" The committee was asked ""to proactively co-operate with law enforcement and other authorities if potentially relevant information arose at those titles. As a result of that review, which is ongoing, the MSC provided information to the Elveden investigation which led to today's arrests."" The Sun, which is Britain's best-selling tabloid newspaper, was the sister paper of News International's now-defunct Sunday title, the News of the World. A spokeswoman for News International earlier declined to comment on the search of its offices. The investigation into alleged corruption, known as Operation Elveden, is being run in conjunction with an inquiry into phone hacking prompted by allegations of wrongdoing at News of the World. The best-selling News of the World tabloid was shuttered in July amid outrage over claims that its staff hacked the voicemail of a missing 13-year-old girl who turned out to have been murdered. James Murdoch, chief executive of News International and the son of media mogul Rupert Murdoch, has insisted that the practice of phone hacking was not widespread. News Group Newspapers, a subsidiary of News International that was the publisher of News of the World, agreed to payouts in the High Court totaling hundreds of thousands of dollars earlier this month over phone hacking claims. Among those who read statements in court were Labour Party lawmaker Chris Bryant, former Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott, actor Jude Law, the actor's ex-wife Sadie Frost, and high-profile rugby player Gavin Henson. News International said the company ""made no admission as part of these settlements that directors or senior employees knew about the wrongdoing by NGN or sought to conceal it. However, for the purpose of reaching these settlements only, NGN agreed that the damages to be paid to claimants should be assessed as if this was the case."" Both James and Rupert Murdoch, as well as senior executives at News International, have testified before British lawmakers examining allegations of wrongdoing. A public inquiry has also been set up to look at claims of widespread misconduct by the British media. Representatives of a range of news outlets have appeared before it. There have been 13 arrests in connection with Operation Elveden and 17 in relation to Operation Weeting, the phone hacking inquiry, the Metropolitan Police confirmed. Three people have been arrested in connection with both investigations. Operation Elveden is overseen by the British police watchdog, the Independent Police Complaints Commission.","NEW: Those arrested have been bailed and the searches are over, police say .

"(CNN) -- What authorities are calling Chris Dorner's campaign of guerrilla warfare against his former comrades in the Los Angeles Police Department has its roots in a hotel lobby in San Pedro, the city's port district. In July 2007, the former Navy officer was an LAPD probationary officer, riding patrol with a veteran of the force, when they were dispatched to check out a report of a disturbance at the DoubleTree Hotel. A man had refused to leave the premises and was sitting on the bench outside the lobby when they arrived. Christopher Gettler had ""a glazed look in his eyes,"" court documents later recounted, and he refused to get up and speak with police. Dorner and his training officer, Teresa Evans, started to take him into custody, but he refused to comply and took a swing at them. Gettler's family later told investigators he had a history of mental illness. Dorner wrestled with him, and the two tumbled into a planter in front of the DoubleTree. Evans readied a Taser and warned the man to stop. He submitted only after she shocked him with the electronic device. That's where the stories start to differ. And those differences led to an investigation by the LAPD's internal affairs unit, Dorner's eventual dismissal from the force and a long court battle to clear his name -- a battle he was losing in California courts. Timeline in manhunt for former L.A. cop . The LAPD now says Dorner is the subject of a massive manhunt. It accuses him of killing one police officer and wounding two others, as well as killing the daughter of his police union representative and her fiance on Sunday. In a letter addressed to ""America"" and provided to CNN by an LAPD source, Dorner threatens to retaliate against officers involved in his case and their families. ""The attacks will stop when the department states the truth about my innocence,"" he wrote. Two weeks after that encounter in San Pedro, Dorner went to a sergeant to report that Evans had kicked Gettler after he had given up. The LAPD investigated his complaint and ruled it ""unfounded,"" based on accounts by three hotel employees, in May 2008. Then the investigators' report turns to Dorner. ""The delay in reporting the alleged misconduct coupled with the witness' statements irreparably destroy Dorner's credibility, and bring into question his suitability for continued employment as a police officer,"" it states. The report found Dorner had made false statements to a superior while reporting the allegation that Evans had kicked the suspect and to internal affairs investigators looking into the claim. The report recommended his dismissal, a process that was finalized after a hearing of the department's Board of Rights in January 2009. He sued to have the decision reversed, calling the process a ""witch hunt,"" but lost at the trial court and in a state appellate court. Dorner argued that the board had ignored evidence from both Gettler and his father, who recounted that his son said at the time that he'd been kicked. Alleged cop-killer details threats to LAPD, why he was driven to violence .

"(CNN) -- A tearful Victoria Azarenka retained her Australian Open title and world No. 1 ranking after overcoming crowd favorite Li Na in a dramatic women's final on Saturday. The 23-year-old broke down as she celebrated her second grand slam title, denying her Chinese opponent her second after coming from behind to triumph 4-6 6-4 6-3 and claim the $2 million first prize. The Belorussian went into the match having upset local fans after taking a controversial 10-minute medical break during a key point of her semifinal win over American teen Sloane Stephens, but this time she was forced to wait as Li twice had to receive lengthy treatment. The match was also interrupted in the deciding set by a break for the traditional Australia Day fireworks. ""It's been a real long two weeks,"" Azarenka said on-court after winning in two hours and 40 minutes. ""I will always keep very special memories of this court. It will be in my heart forever."" Li, the losing finalist in 2011, raced to a 5-2 lead in the opening set as she made a strong bid to add to her French Open title that same year -- a breakthrough win that made her the first Asian female to win a grand slam singles title. However, she was unable to show the same control that had allowed her to thrash world No. 2 Maria Sharapova in straight sets in the semifinals. Azarenka led 3-0 in the second set, then sixth-ranked Li went over on her ankle after winning the next game. It looked like it might bring the final to a premature end but the 30-year-old got back on court after having her foot strapped and reduced the deficit further. However, Azarenka rallied to take the set and then broke Li's serve to lead 1-0 in the third set. Li broke back and then led 2-1 before the fireworks started in celebration of 225 years since the first fleet of colonists arrived from the UK. It was an inopportune break for Li, who again went over on her ankle and banged her head on the court as she tried to protect her damaged foot. ""For two seconds I couldn't really see anything. It was totally black,"" she told reporters. ""So when the physio come, she was like, 'Focus on my finger.' I started laughing. I was thinking, 'This is a tennis court, not a hospital.' She was like, 'Follow my finger,' because I didn't follow. I just watched the eyes. She says, 'Follow.' I say, 'Why? I'm okay.' "" Li was unable to maintain momentum and Azarenka broke her serve to lead 3-2 -- the 15th break in just 27 games of an error-strewn match -- and went on to clinch the victory that denied Serena Williams a return to the No. 1 spot. Her more consistent approach paid off as Li paid for making 57 unforced errors to 27 despite making 36 winners to Azarenka's 18. ""It's a completely different mix of feelings. This one is way more emotional,"" said Azarenka, who last year topped the WTA Tour money list with more than $7 million. ""Li Na was absolutely playing great tennis. Unfortunate things that happened to her, you know, but that's sport. ""I'm just happy that everything I went through, you know, I still could manage to give my best and really come out there and try to focus on my game and play tennis that I can produce."" Meanwhile, Americans Bob and Mike Bryan won a record 13th men's grand slam doubles title on Saturday, thrashing Dutchmen Robin Haase and Igor Sijsling in Melbourne. The twin brothers moved past the 12 won by the Australian pair John Newcombe and Tony Roche in the 1960s and 1970s as they triumphed 6-3 6-4 in less than an hour. The 34-year-olds, who won the Olympic title last year, have now played in 23 grand slam finals.","World No. 1 Victoria Azarenka wins Australian Open title for the second year in a row .

"ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) -- Long before U2 and Bono blazed their own paths, and decades before the Christian music industry became a half-billion-dollar annual business, a hippie musician with long blond locks paved the way. Larry Norman sang about drugs, politics, racism, sex and Jesus -- sometimes in the same song. Larry Norman was a Christian rock musician before the genre existed, combining faith with a backbeat and social consciousness. Think of him as rock music's street preacher, often referred to as ""the father of Christian rock."" ""Between 1969 and 1979, Larry Norman was the Christian rock scene's answer to Bob Dylan, John Lennon and Mick Jagger,"" said Emmy-nominated director David Di Sabatino, who takes a critical look at Norman's career and life in his documentary ""Fallen Angel: The Outlaw Larry Norman."" ""He set the standard. He created the space for others to exist. ... The vision he created for where Christian rock music could go still resonates today."" The documentary is scheduled to go into limited theatrical release in early 2010. Norman hit the U.S. music scene at a turbulent time for the nation. His first solo album, ""Upon This Rock,"" came out in late 1969, after he left the band People! The San Francisco Bay area psychedelic group was fresh off the success of a Top 20 hit with a cover of the Zombies' ""I Love You."" It was a time when college campuses were erupting in anti-Vietnam War protests and the nation was still trying to digest what had just happened that summer at Woodstock. As many Americans looked for answers, Norman offered his faith, a bold decision for an unknown solo artist making his major-label debut. ""It was a pretty gutsy move to sing about Jesus on his first record,"" younger brother Charles Norman said. ""To take a chance on mentioning Jesus on a secular record was a pretty important step."" "" 'Upon This Rock' was written to stand outside the Christian culture,"" Larry Norman said in an interview with CCM magazine. ""My songs weren't written for Christians. ... I was saying, 'I'm going to present the Gospel, and I'm not going to say it like you want. This album is not for you.' "" No small surprise, given that rock music at the time was the soundtrack of the counterculture and was far from the mainstream. A national survey conducted by Louis Harris and Associates in 1966 found that rock 'n' roll was by far the most unpopular music in the country. About 45 percent of adults said they disliked it, with only about 5 percent saying it was their favorite. Compare that with today, when nearly two-thirds of those asked in a recent Pew Resource Center poll said they listen to it. Being a rocker in the late 1960s wasn't just flying in the face of a conservative Christian music industry but mainstream America as well. Then there were the lyrics, especially on Norman's second solo effort, 1972's ""Only Visiting This Planet."" There were no happy songs about going to heaven; the tunes tackled the social issues of the day. Norman sang about drugs, politics, racism, sex, venereal disease and Jesus -- sometimes in the same song -- getting his music banned from Christian bookstores that might have sold it. ""Stuff like that shocked uptight Christians,"" Charles Norman said in an NPR interview shortly after his brother's death in February 2008 at age 60. ""One of his songs, it's called 'Why Don't You Look Into Jesus,' one of the lines is: 'You've got gonorrhea on Valentine's Day [VD] and you're still looking for the perfect lay. ... Why don't you look into Jesus? He's got the answer.'"" The album also contained what became Larry Norman's signature song, ""Why Should the Devil Have All the Good Music."" Nearly two decades after its release, ""Only Visiting This Planet,"" helmed by Beatles' producer George Martin, was recognized as a seminal recording for the genre, voted by CCM magazine in 1990 as the greatest Christian album ever recorded. A similar list released in 2001 by CCM, a Christian music and lifestyle magazine, put the album at No. 2 all time. U2's ""The Joshua Tree"" was sixth. Norman was inducted into the Gospel Music Hall of Fame that same year, along with Elvis Presley. The accolades came much sooner in the mainstream media. In 1971, Billboard Magazine called Norman ""the most important writer since Paul Simon,"" while Time magazine pegged him as ""probably the top solo artist in the field."" Norman's fans include U2, Guns N' Roses and Bob Dylan, according to his brother Charles. John Mellencamp said he's one, too. British pop star Cliff Richard made no secret of his admiration. ""When I first became a Christian, I hunted around in vain to find Christian rock 'n' roll music I could relate to. It just all sounded horrible,"" Richard said on ""Rockspell,"" a Gospel-music-themed BBC television show he hosted in 1986, and on which Norman appeared. Then he was introduced to Norman's music, ""and I just was overjoyed and thrilled, because suddenly I could relate ... and there seemed to be a Christian who could do it as well, if not better, than the rest of us."" Black Francis of the alternative rock group the Pixies said Norman has been a lifelong influence. ""I listened to his records growing up, and saw him perform many times. In fact, I used to dress up like him; long blond hair with bangs, sort of a grown-out British invasion look, with black jacket, black shirt, black pants and two-tone black and white cheerleader shoes,"" Francis said. ""While Larry is always referenced by his Christian beliefs, to me he was always an entertainer ... humorous, poignant and always rock 'n' roll. His respect for the arena of entertainment is what gave him his power as a performer."" More than 300 versions of Norman's songs have been recorded by other artists, including non-Gospel acts as diverse as Richard and Francis, as well as Sammy Davis Jr., Petula Clark and Tennessee Ernie Ford. Christian music has come a long way in the 40 years since Norman pioneered Christian rock. ""Before Larry Norman, there was not any Christian music industry,"" said Shawn McSpadden, manager for Switchfoot and the Grammy Award-winning band Third Day. But today is a different story, according to figures from the Gospel Music Association. It says 56 million units of Christian/Gospel music sold in 2008, totaling nearly $500 million. ""The Christian music industry has been very business-savvy, probably without even realizing it, in that a lot of the artists and bands use their local church as their home base when they begin their careers,"" said Bruce Burch of the University of Georgia's Music Business School. ""They immediately have fans that are passionate and devout not only about them as a band or artist, but to their message."" Album sales for the genre, during 2008, outsold classical, jazz, new age and Latin, according to Nielsen SoundScan. Norman, a hippie musician who set out to sing about his faith, blazed the trail for Christian rock.","Larry Norman was Christian rock musician before genre existed .

"(CNN) -- An estranged son of anti-gay Kansas pastor Fred Phelps said Wednesday that the spiritual leader of Westboro Baptist Church hit his wife and beat his children with a mattock handle until they bled. ""I think what he does out there is evil,"" said Nathan ""Nate"" Phelps, during an appearance on HLN's ""Issues with Jane Velez-Mitchell."" Nate Phelps is the seventh of the Westboro Baptist minister's 13 children. The younger Phelps severed ties with his family on his 18th birthday and said he hasn't had contact with his father in three decades. Nate Phelps is currently writing a book about his family. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled earlier this month that Westboro's practice of picketing the funerals of fallen soldiers with offensive placards is constitutionally protected free speech. The picketing, which includes chants and placards stating ""God Hates Fags"" and ""Thank God for Dead Soldiers,"" have enraged supporters of the U.S. military and the families and friends of slain soldiers. Nate Phelps called his pastor father ""one of the best reasons that America has been forced to get off the fence and address this issue (of gay rights)."" ""But at the same time you can't ignore the fact that he's done a lot of damage,"" Phelps said. ""He's hurt a lot of families, not only in the gay community, but the families of these soldiers."" The younger Phelps said his father also hurt his own family. ""He used his fists. He used his knees and he used ... the handle of a mattock,"" said Phelps, referring to a pick-like digging tool. ""He used that in such a way that it split the skin on the back of the kid's legs so they bled."" ""If they want to call that discipline, that's fine. But I call it abuse,"" Phelps said. The son said Fred Phelps also hit his mother, but not with the handle of the mattock. Phelps has also said his father abused prescription drugs when he was in law school. He didn't back down from the claim during the HLN interview. Velez-Mitchell read a statement from Nate Phelps' sister, Shirley Phelps-Roper, denying the claim. ""Yikes. Hell no. His (Nate Phelps') imagination goes on and on,"" Roper wrote.  ""This lie should not have come out of his mouth when he decided to reject the word of God. Nothing he can say will change the fact that God hates (homosexuals) and their enablers and therefore God hates America and America is doomed."" Nate Phelps responded that his sister ""just cynically lies about what happened."" Likewise, Phelps said his father manipulates facts and circumstances to reach false conclusions. ""My father can make any connection to anything that anyone has done or hasn't done in their life and point to that to say that  that's evidence they're damned and going to hell,"" Phelps said. ""He's convinced that homosexuality is the ultimate sin against God. ""So since the United States is taking steps to move in the direction of equality for gays in America, he says that has doomed America,"" Phelps said. ""So anyone who is connected to America, so anyone who is supporting America in any sense is subject to the wrath of God."" When asked what he would say to his father if he could, Nate Phelps replied, ""I've never had a relationship with my father. I wouldn't know what to say to him."" There was no immediate public response from Fred Phelps to his son's televised remarks.","Nate Phelps says the actions of his father, the anti-gay Kansas pastor, are ""evil""

"(CNN) -- There had to be something special about Rebekah Brooks. Here was a woman, after all, who managed to be a close friend of Tony and Cherie Blair, then a friend (perhaps less close and more briefly) of Gordon and Sarah Brown, and then a very close (""lots of love"") friend of David and Samantha Cameron. Given the personality differences between those involved, and given their political differences, it is at least surprising that any one person could be cosy with them all. And for one woman to overcome the jealousy and suspicion of Brown towards a former chum of Blair, and then of Cameron towards a former chum of Brown and Blair, is nothing short of remarkable. Looking back, it is hard to avoid the conclusion either that this woman was so powerful that politicians felt they had no choice but to clasp her to their bosoms, or that she was so amazingly nice and such utterly marvelous company that anybody would want her at their dinner table. Giving evidence to Lord Justice Leveson's inquiry on her relations with politicians, Brooks did her very best to show us her amazingly nice and marvelous side -- even in the teeth of some pretty niggling questions from Robert Jay QC. Demure and tidy beneath the famous mop of hair, she was polite and well-spoken, and always -- Andy Coulson-like -- controlled. But she also strove to appear warm, helpful and honorable. Where Jay tried to provoke, she smiled. When he pushed her towards a corner, she became engagingly baffled by his perversity. Her friendships were just normal, she implied. How often did she send text messages to the prime minister? ""I would text Mr Cameron, on occasion -- like a lot of people."" Like you and me, perhaps. Her persistent forgetfulness about almost anything substantive was, her expression implied, normal too. Who remembers this kind of stuff? As for influencing politicians, everything she did, she suggested, was driven by her loyalty not to Rupert Murdoch but to The Sun's millions of readers, whom she could not or would not distinguish from ""the nation"" or ""the country."" She acted ""for the paper and for the readership,"" and insofar as she had power it was as a kind of embodiment of her readers. So when she (or The Sun) did something tough, as they did more than once to Gordon Brown, she wanted us to know that it was done for high-minded reasons, and with pain in her heart. Notably when The Sun dumped Brown on the morning after his annual party conference speech in 2009, the timing was not, she said, designed to maximize damage, but to allow Brown a final opportunity to impress Sun readers in the speech. She also told us she tried to ring Brown just ahead of publication to warn him, as a ""general courtesy"" and because it was ""the right thing to do."" When The Sun published a story about the health of the Browns' son, it was all done in the nicest possible way, and if the couple had had reservations she would have spiked it. All of this Jay greeted with an air of skepticism, but Brooks's message was clear: ""Look at me. I'm nice."" What could be more natural than the Blairs, Browns and Camerons all falling in turn for such charms? Maybe you would too. Mince pies and mulled wine in your Oxfordshire retreat? Invite Rebekah. Girls' slumber party at Chequers? Invite Rebekah. But of course it can't be natural, as Lord Justice Leveson himself stepped in to remind us. In one of his several pertinent interventions he spoke to Brooks of ""relationships you have been careful to develop for professional reasons, and doubtless coincidentally for personal reasons, over the years."" Those words ""doubtless coincidentally"" carry a vast weight. Even if Rebekah Brooks were Snow White and Mother Teresa rolled into one, nobody could seriously believe that the professional and the personal reasons for her friendships with political leaders just happened to coincide. And Brooks is nothing like Snow White or Mother Teresa. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Brian Cathcart .","Evidence given by ex-News International executive Rebekah Brooks at media inquiry highlighted relations with politicians .

"(CNN) -- A man accused of killing a school district librarian and raping her 10-year-old daughter in upstate New York had removed an electronic tracking anklet before carrying out the attack, police said. David J. Renz, 29, of Cicero, is accused of abducting the 47-year-old mother and her daughter shortly before 9 p.m. on Thursday as they left a gymnastics class, state police said. He tied up the mother and raped her daughter in their vehicle, state police said. He then drove the car a short distance down the road, police said, where the librarian was fatally stabbed. The girl managed to escape the vehicle and flag down a passing motorist for help. Her mother was declared dead of multiple stab wounds at the hospital. The girl is still being treated for the injuries she sustained in the attack. Renz -- who police said was arrested after trying to flee the scene through the woods -- has been charged with rape, kidnapping and murder. He had been ordered to wear the electronic tracking device on his ankle while awaiting trial on child pornography charges, Matt Brown, chief probation officer of the Northern District of New York, told CNN Friday. Renz was also told he had to be home between the hours of 9 p.m. and 7 a.m., Brown said. Authorities believe Renz was able to remove the strap to the tracking device and reconnect it quickly enough that the probation office was not alerted, Brown said. If a tracking device experiences any trauma, such as banging against a wall, a ""strap tampering"" report is generated, Brown said. However, if the situation is resolved quickly enough, the probation office is not notified. This meant Renz was able to reconnect the device and leave it in his home before his alleged attack, Brown said. Renz was remanded at the federal hearing for his probation violation Friday and then charged on a state level with the alleged attack. He was expected to be appointed attorney, though it wasn't immediately clear who that would be. CNN's Lorenzo Ferrigno contributed to this report.","David J.

"London (CNN) -- A former British prime minister who has been a harsh critic of media baron Rupert Murdoch is due to testify Monday at an enquiry spawned by phone-hacking at Murdoch's News of the World tabloid. Gordon Brown is due to take the stand at the Leveson Inquiry, a wide-ranging probe set up by the British government to examine media ethics. Former Prime Minister Tony Blair has already testified. Murdoch himself spent a day and a half on the stand earlier this year, and said that Gordon Brown had vowed to declare war on Murdoch's News Corp. after one its high-profile tabloids withdrew support for Brown's Labour party. Cameron, who has been under pressure because of his ties to Murdoch and his former newspaper chief Rebekah Brooks, is scheduled to testify all day Thursday at the Leveson Inquiry. Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne will be quizzed Monday, as will former Prime Minister Gordon Brown, the inquiry's witness list shows. John Major, another ex-prime minister, will appear Tuesday, as will opposition Labour Party leader Ed Miliband and his deputy, Harriet Harman. Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg is scheduled to testify Wednesday, ahead of Scottish First Minister Alex Salmond. The judge-led Leveson Inquiry, set up by Cameron after the phone hacking scandal at Murdoch's News of the World newspaper last summer, is examining the relationship between the media and politicians. Blair, in his testimony, said he came under ""political pressure"" from Murdoch during his time in office but denied that his relationship with the media baron was too ""cozy."" In April, Cameron told politicians in the House of Commons: ""I think we all, on both sides of this house, did a bit too much cozying up to Mr. Murdoch."" Cameron has faced questions about his ties to Murdoch and Brooks, both of whom have also appeared before the inquiry, particularly in relation to News Corp.'s bid to take full control of British satellite broadcaster BSkyB. The attempt was abandoned amid the furor over phone hacking at News of the World, owned by News Corp.'s British subsidiary News International. Brooks detailed frequent contacts with Cameron in the run-up to the 2010 election and said she had received commiserations from the prime minister when she resigned from News International last summer. She and her husband, racehorse trainer Charlie Brooks, were last month charged with interfering with the police investigation. Cameron's judgment in hiring former News of the World editor Andy Coulson as his communications director has also been called into question. Coulson resigned from the Downing Street role early last year when police began a new phone-hacking investigation, saying it had become a distraction. He quit the News of the World after two employees were jailed over phone hacking in 2007 but denies knowing of wrongdoing while he was in charge. Coulson was last week arrested and charged with perjury over court testimony about phone hacking, according to Britain's Press Association news agency. The Leveson Inquiry was established by Cameron after British public anger at the News of the World about the hacking of voice messages of a missing teenage girl who turned out to have been murdered. The case of Milly Dowler came on top of apologies from the tabloid for the hacking of the phones of celebrities and politicians and proved to be the last straw for the paper, which was shut down in July. The inquiry is intended to explore press ethics in Britain more widely, alongside police investigations into phone hacking, e-mail hacking and police bribery by people working for Murdoch's British newspapers.

"(CNN)  -- Federal officials have opened a civil rights investigation into a police narcotics raid on the home of a Maryland mayor in which police burst in without knocking and shot the mayor's two dogs to death. Mayor Cheye Calvo of Berwyn Heights, Maryland, and his mother-in-law were handcuffed and forced to kneel on the floor during the July 29 raid, which police said was part of an investigation into a scheme in which drugs apparently were sent to unsuspecting people. Prince George's County police, who were in charge of the raid, issued a statement Friday clearing the couple of involvement and expressing ""regret."" The FBI and the U.S. attorney's office in Maryland are investigating the incident, FBI spokesman Richard Wolf said Friday. Calvo had asked for the federal investigation. ""We lost our family dogs,"" he said Thursday. ""We did it at the hands of sheriff's deputies who burst through our front door, rifles blazing.""  Watch the mayor's description of the raid Â» . According to The Associated Press, two men, including a FedEx deliveryman, have been arrested in the case. Police said the scheme involved shipping drugs to unsuspecting people's homes and intercepting the packages. About $3.6 million in marijuana had been seized, police told the AP. In this instance, investigators told the AP, a package containing 32 pounds of marijuana was sent from Los Angeles, California, to Calvo's house in Berwyn Heights, a town of 3,000 residents 10 miles from Washington. The package was addressed to his Calvo's wife, Trinity Tomsic. In transit, a drug-sniffing dog in Arizona brought attention to the package, investigators told the AP. Police intercepted it when it arrived in Maryland, and it was delivered to the Calvo home by an undercover officer, according to the AP report. In a statement released Friday, Prince George's County Police Chief Melvin High said he called Calvo on Thursday to tell him that in screening the case with the state's attorney's office, ""it was concluded that Ms. Tomsic and the Calvo family were innocent victims of drug traffickers."" ""I called him to express my sorrow and regret for that and for the loss of the family's beloved dogs,"" High said in the statement. A thorough review of the raid is being conducted, which is standard procedure in such cases, the department said. The Prince George's County Police Department was in charge of the raid, and the sheriff's special operations team was assisting.  Watch the sheriff defend the drug raid Â» . Calvo said he set the package aside after it arrived at his home and didn't open it. He said he was changing clothes and preparing to attend a community meeting when ""the door flew open. I heard gunfire shoot off. There was a brief pause and more gunfire."" He said he was brought downstairs at gunpoint while in his boxer shorts, handcuffed and forced to kneel on the floor along with his mother-in-law. Then, he said, ""I noticed my two dead dogs lying in pools of their own blood."" While he was being held, Calvo said, he told the police he is the town's mayor, but they didn't believe him. ""They told a detective I was crazy,"" he said. Berwyn Heights has a police force, he said, but Prince George's County police did not notify the municipal authorities of their interest in his home or in the package. ""It was that lack of communication that really led to what has really been the most traumatic experience of our lives,"" he said. Calvo added, ""they've arrested the real criminals involved. We're pleased to have that and get our name back as well. But really, this doesn't excuse what they did."" CNN's Kevin Bohn contributed to this report. Copyright 2008 CNN.

"Washington (CNN) -- Firings and charges against Justice Department officials who oversaw the agency's flawed gun-running operation are likely to come in the next six months, Attorney General Eric Holder said Thursday. Holder was speaking before the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee on the controversial sting operation called Operation Fast and Furious. Asked what steps he had taken since the controversy came to light 13 months ago, Holder said he is awaiting the conclusions of an internal investigation. Regarding people found culpable in that inquiry, he said, ""I can assure you those people will be removed from federal service."" Any possible charges will not be filed until the department has the evidence to get a conviction, he said at the hearing. The operation, designed to monitor the flow of weapons, allowed illegally purchased firearms to be taken from U.S. gun stores across the Mexican border to drug cartels. However, hundreds of weapons were lost or unaccounted for, and a storm of outrage erupted when two of the missing weapons were found at a site where Border Patrol agent Brian Terry was killed in December 2010. Terry's family filed a $25 million wrongful death claim Wednesday against the federal government, charging that U.S. investigators allowed murder weapons into the hands of criminals. ""The murder of Agent Terry and other acts of violent crimes were the natural consequence of (the) decision to let dangerous weapons designed to kill human beings 'walk' into the hands of violent drug-trafficking gangs,"" the claim said. Democrats and Republicans have been at odds over who knew what about the operation and when. At the outset of the hearing, new information on the operation was scarce, and the back-and-forth between members of the two parties dominated. Rep. Darrell Issa, R-California, threatened to begin a contempt proceeding against Holder to force him to release more documents and pressed him for proof that such gun-running will not happen again. Republicans are investigating how high up the operation was sanctioned, while Democrats defended Holder's testimony that he did not know about it. The showdown comes after Issa and the Justice Department exchanged sharp letters in recent days. The Justice Department sent a pointed letter to Issa late Wednesday, rejecting his demand on Tuesday that certain documents be turned over by next week. In his letter to Holder, Issa blasted the Justice Department for dumping -- after the close of business Friday -- important, long-sought documents that disclosed that Assistant Attorney General Lanny Breuer had discussed with Mexican officials a plan to allow illegal guns ""to walk"" into Mexico, where Mexican officials would arrest the gun-runners. Issa said an e-mail showed that ""Breuer suggested allowing straw purchasers cross in Mexico so (Mexican authorities) can arrest, prosecute and convict."" ""These new documents show that Breuer made this statement on February 4, 2011, the same day Assistant Attorney General Ronald Weich wrote to Congress denying that the department allowed guns to walk,"" Issa said. The Justice Department fired back Wednesday, claiming that Issa's letter showed ""significant misunderstanding both of the documents we recently produced and of the Department's position on the issues you raise."" The five-page letter signed by Deputy Attorney General James Cole strongly rejected the claim that the documents show that Breuer supported letting illegal guns make their way to Mexican cartels. ""Assistant Attorney General Breuer proposed to his Mexican counterparts a scenario in which those carrying illegal weapons across the border would be arrested at the border by Mexican officials and charged in Mexico. While these officials ultimately did not pursue that strategy, it is neither fair nor accurate to say that this was advocacy of 'gunwalking'. It was not."" Republicans have pressed to learn whether top Obama administration officials were aware of the controversial tactics, but to date, Breuer is the highest-ranking official shown to have any awareness of any possible gun-running operation. Democrats have released documents suggesting that the U.S. attorney's office in Phoenix and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives field office in Phoenix were at the heart of the decision-making in developing sting operations, including Operation Fast and Furious. Issa said in his letter to Holder that, ""if the department continues to obstruct the congressional inquiry by not providing documents and information, this committee will have no alternative but to move forward with proceedings to hold you in contempt of Congress."" The Justice Department response Wednesday rejected Issa's February 9 deadline to produce all demanded documents. Cole called the deadline ""impossible"" to meet because of the broad scope of the request. He did not directly refer to the threat of a contempt charge by Issa.","NEW: Slain agent's family filed a $25 million wrongful death claim .

"(CNN) -- Ann Cooper is on a one-woman whirlwind campaign to change the way kids eat in schools. ""We're killing our kids with food,"" she says. Ann Cooper sees her work transforming school  lunch programs as a way to leave a lasting impact. Half of all the Hispanic and African-American kids born in 2000 and one-third of Caucasian kids will have diabetes in their lifetime, many before they graduate college, Cooper says, citing U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention statistics. ""It's all because of what we are feeding them,"" she says. ""It's all preventable."" Cooper, self-proclaimed renegade lunch lady and chef, is actively working against what she describes as entrenched interests -- fast-food companies and junk-food producers -- that she says profit from selling unhealthy foods to schools. They're ""basically making money off our children's health and their future,"" she says. ""I'm just so pissed off."" She wasn't always this way. Cooper used to be a big-shot celebrity chef who worked at tony resorts, on cruise ships, for hotel chains and prestigious film festivals. She's won numerous awards and is on boards for executive chefs, women chefs and the Alumni Committee of the Culinary Institute of America. Despite the accolades, Cooper felt something was missing. She recognized that as a celebrity chef, she was reaching only the top 10 percent of the wealthiest people in the country. So she sought ways to make a difference. She and her fellow culinary icons ""would spend a lot of time trying to give back,"" she says. ""We cooked for Second Harvest, we cooked for donations, we cooked whatever."" But there was also impermanence to food. Whether people ate her food or threw it away, Cooper lamented that it all ended up as sewage or waste. After writing her first book, ""A Woman's Place Is In the Kitchen,"" on the role of women in food, she started to feel like there was a way to leave something behind. Writing the book led to associations with high-profile women who were trying to make a difference -- Alice Waters from Berkeley, California, and Nora Pouillon of Washington, D.C., who were into organics and sustainability. Those relationships changed the way she thought about food -- so much so that a few years later came her second book, ""Bitter Harvest,"" about where our food supply comes from and how political concerns often trump healthy diets. Now Cooper knew she was getting somewhere. When the Ross School in East Hampton, New York, called offering her a position as executive chef of wellness and nutrition, she didn't exactly jump at the chance. But after giving it some thought, she realized it was a way to reach future generations and really leave a lasting impact. ""All of a sudden, it felt like, wow, this is something I could really do, and I could really make a difference."" Today, Cooper is director of nutrition services in Berkeley, where she has transformed the school lunch program from 90 percent frozen reheated foods to 90 percent fresh. Berkeley schools used to serve fruit once a week; now it's on the menu every day, and so is the salad bar. More than that, the healthy food curriculum is carried into the classroom. With a staff of 90 to help, Cooper runs cooking classes, gardening classes and serves food in 17 locations. She has created a ""meal wheel"" to help kids all over the country understand what should be on their plates daily. With her Web page, Lunch Lessons, Cooper is hoping to make her program a model. ""There's only one of me. I can't cover the whole country,"" she says. If she had one wish, Cooper says, it would be that ""Oprah would take on this issue as a social justice issue and that we would get our presidential candidates to really start to talk about this issue, because I just can't imagine what's more important ... than the next generation. We're just really not taking care of them."" E-mail to a friend .

"(Rolling Stone) -- A rare combination of angelic delicacy and extraordinary power, Art Garfunkel's voice has lent reverie and wonder to songs for nearly 50 years. This two-CD set, lovingly curated by Garfunkel himself, collects 34 examples of his best work, beginning with Simon and Garfunkel classics such as ""The Sound of Silence"" and ""Bridge Over Troubled Water"" and moving through solo standouts like his gossamer version of the Beach Boys' ""Disney Girls."" It's a revelation from start to finish. One of ""The Singer's"" particular pleasures is its nonchronological sequence; when a live rendition of ""For Emily, Wherever I May Find Her"" surprisingly emerges between the elegant New York reminiscence of ""Perfect Moment"" and Garfunkel's duet with James Taylor on the Everly Brothers' ""Crying in the Rain,"" it hits with all its original power. Two previously unreleased songs, ""Lena"" and ""Long Way Home,"" stand up well in this impressive company. Finally, ""The Singer"" is a masterpiece of subtlety. Garfunkel is obviously capable of bravura moments, as on Jimmy Webb's ""Skywriter,"" but he's a master of restraint. This set's impact, then, results from the numberless graceful choices Garfunkel makes as a performer, allowing his voice to serve these evocative songs while letting them serve as vehicles for his peerless voice.

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Workers who are legally prescribed marijuana to treat illness can still be fired from their jobs, following a ruling Thursday from the California Supreme Court. Medical marijuana user Angel Raich, 41, had her pot confiscated while her case was appealed. The 5-2 decision upheld the job termination of Gary Ross, who flunked a company drug test shortly after being hired at a telecommunications firm. A state referendum that allows people to use medical marijuana with a physician's recommendation are immune from some state criminal drug possession charges. But the state high court said such legal protection only goes so far. ""Nothing in the text or history of the Compassionate Use Act suggests the voters intended the measure to address the respective rights and duties of employers and employees,"" wrote Justice Kathryn Mickle Werdegar. ""Under California law, an employer may require pre-employment drug tests, and take illegal drug use into consideration in making employment decisions."" The court agreed with RagingWire Telecommunications' contention it had a right to fire Ross because any marijuana use is illegal under separate U.S. law. The company said its work across state borders could put it in legal jeopardy from federal labor standards involving the conduct and production of its work force. The U.S. Supreme Court has said the Bush administration can prohibit the backyard cultivation of pot for personal use, because such use has broader social and financial implications. A federal appeals court last March said medical marijuana users can be subject to arrest and confiscation of the material, under federal anti-drug laws. The issue is being closely watched because of the obvious conflict between state and federal laws over the use of medical marijuana. Various courts have said the federal Controlled Substances Act does not violate state autonomy. The latest case involves Ross' back problems stemming from injuries sustained when he served in the U.S. Air Force. He received a physician's recommendation to use pot in 1999 and presented a card certifying his use of the narcotic when he took the employment drug test in 2001. Ross said his condition does ""not affect his ability to do the essential functions of the job"" his former employer hired him to do, according to his original complaint. The Sacramento-based company said its no-tolerance policy applies to all workers, since potential ""abuse of drugs and alcohol"" could lead to ""increased absenteeism, diminished productivity, greater health costs, increased safety problems, and potential liability to third parties,"" according to the company's lawyers. Ross' job performance was not at issue in the case. The state supreme court said the law allowing use of marijuana for some patients is ""modest"" in scope, limiting the rights of some patients. The U.S. Supreme Court ruling in 2005 for the Bush administration giving it broad authority to crack down on illegal drug use was criticized by patient rights groups and the movement to legalize marijuana. ""Congress' power to regulate purely activities that are part of an economic 'class of activities' that have a substantial effect on interstate commerce is firmly established,"" wrote Justice John Paul Stevens. Under federal law, the Controlled Substances Act prevents the cultivation and possession of marijuana, even by people who claim personal ""medicinal"" use. The federal government has argued its overall anti-drug campaign would be undermined even by limited patient exceptions. That high court case involved a separate lawsuit from a pot patient from Oakland, California, who has a variety of medical conditions, including a brain tumor. Angel Raich had her pot confiscated and was not allowed to use it while her case was appealed. The Drug Enforcement Administration began raids in 2001 against patients using the drug and their caregivers in California. Along with California, 11 other states have passed laws permitting marijuana use by patients with a doctor's approval: Alaska, Colorado, Hawaii, Maine, Montana, Nevada, New Mexico, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington. Arizona also has a similar law, but no formal program in place to administer prescription marijuana. California's Compassionate Use Act permits patients with a doctor's approval to grow, smoke or acquire the drug for ""medical needs."" Users include television host Montel Williams, who has multiple sclerosis. E-mail to a friend .","California court upheld the termination of an employee who flunked drug test .

"(CNN)  -- Real men eat salads. I know this because I am a dude. Right now, in my fridge, I have five bottles of hot sauce, a jar of Cheez Whiz and half a pack of hot dogs. But recently I went to lunch with a couple of buds, and I ordered a salad. I ordered it hard. It was a basic frissÃ©e salad with bacon, shallots and a poached egg, tossed in a light vinaigrette. FrissÃ©e is a curly, toothsome leaf, bitter enough to balance bacon and egg but still possessed of a pleasant spring. My friends laughed at me. They pointed. One ordered a burger, the other fried calamari. I was chastised for not eating ""man food."" For those of you who aren't familiar with this gender normative term, ""man food"" is food that you'd imagine a lumberjack or a cowboy or a Viking would eat. Towers of butter-soaked pancakes. Pots of napalm-hot chili. Meat on a bone. Thoroughly unsubtle, ""man food"" is rustic fare meant to satisfy a hearty appetite. Quantity is prized over quality. Calories are ""fun points."" The more ""fun points,"" the tastier the belly filler. But sometimes a dude needs a change. Specifically, a salad. A fresh, crisp, crunchy salad. Salads offer breathers between manly meals. Spinach, cucumber, tomato, red onions, mushrooms, chickpeas, oil and vinegar -- that is my usual jam. I don't need any fancy, goopy dressings compromising my vegetables. (What does a ranch actually taste like, anyway?) Sometimes, I might throw some almonds or walnuts up in there. I've been known to be down with blueberries and mandarin oranges. I like bacon or grilled chicken on occasion. I am not a fan of unnecessary carbs like croutons. And then there are those moments I go crazy and get a frissÃ©e freakin' salad. I didn't evolve without help. There was a time where, if I cut myself shaving, I'd bleed sausage gravy. My heart squeezed more than it pumped. And I also grew what I call ""fat wings."" Luckily, the woman I was dating at that time didn't like any of those things. Being able to sit in a bathtub full of buffalo wings is every dude's birthright, but I eventually learned that being attractive for your significant other is also pretty manly. My girlfriend was a smart woman and didn't bring up my devolving into a human biscuit. What she did was announce that we were going to save money so that Saturday nights, we could go to the local barbecue joint and destroy some cow with our faces. Obviously, my first thought was, ""Aww, she wants me to help her lose weight."" So I humored her. She came home from the supermarket with a stack of plastic disposable containers. In each, she put one potential salad ingredient. Not only the ones that would become my favorite but kidney beans, green peppers, corn and pepperoni slices. She created a mini-salad bar in our fridge. It was easy, and I was told I could eat as much as I wanted. This became my lunch and occasional dinner. You know what? We saved money. I lost weight. Gained energy. And my girlfriend and I, well, let's just say we had the whoopee time. I kept this up this salad-centric diet for months. My friends would come over to watch a fight or brawl on the PlayStation, and I'd meet them at the door with a salad in my hand. The landlord would need my help with some drywall; I'd put my salad down. At work, I'd articulate corporate strategy during lunch meetings spearing cucumbers in my lucky bowl of awesome salad. I made eating salad sexy. I made it macho, macho. Is it rabbit food? Friend, if it's rabbit food, then that rabbit is the size of a ferocious bear. My friends poked fun at me as I munched on my fancy salad. It was tasty. I love how the warm yolk from the poached egg lightly coated the frissÃ©e, adding a dimension of hardiness to a dish with such leafy bounce. And the bacon chunks added just the right amount of fatty salt, more sturdy ballast. I wiped my mouth. We were out celebrating one guy's birthday. The other guy, an old friend from college, was ""in-between gigs."" It had been another tough year. ""Salad is not man food,"" they mocked. Oh, but it is. I ordered a final round of beers. Then I picked up the check. Are salads manly? What is the manliest salad? Are you the sort of guy who wouldn't touch a salad if a gun was put to his head? Tell us in the comments whether you think salads can count as ""man food.""","Sometimes a dude needs a fresh, crisp, crunchy salad instead of ""man food""

"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- Phil Lesh is on the phone. Bob Weir and Phil Lesh will be taking part in The Dead's April-May tour. ""I wish I could say I once quit my job to follow the Grateful Dead in my VW bus,"" I tell him. ""But honestly, I'm just not that cool."" The bass player chuckles. ""It's mostly trust-fund kids,"" he confides. ""They're the only ones who are able to do that."" I guess you could say I'm a wannabe Deadhead. Like many Americans, I'm fascinated by tales of the Grateful Dead's improvisational live shows and colorful sense of community. Some 40-odd years after the group rose out of San Francisco's Haight-Ashbury scene of the mid-1960s, there's even a popular Sirius Satellite Radio channel devoted solely to the legendary jam band. A few days ago, the four surviving members of the Grateful Dead dropped a sweet New Year's gift on fans -- they'll reunite for their first concert tour in five years. Just as they did on their last outing, Lesh, guitarist Bob Weir and drummers Mickey Hart and Bill Kreutzmann will perform under the shortened moniker The Dead. It's a reverent nod to their iconic lead guitarist, Jerry Garcia, who died from a heart attack in 1995 after a long struggle with drug addiction. Under the banner, ""An Evening With,"" the trek will encompass 19 shows in 16 cities, kicking off April 12 in Greensboro, North Carolina, and wrapping up May 10 in Mountain View, California. The quartet will be joined by guitarist Warren Haynes and keyboardist Jeff Chimenti. iReport.com: Step back to the 1970s . The reunion is something that's been rumored since Lesh, Weir and Hart headlined a ""Deadheads for Obama"" concert in San Francisco last February. Kreutzmann was in Hawaii that night, but he was there in spirit. iReport: Are you grateful for a Dead tour? ""We've never, ever endorsed a candidate -- ever,"" Lesh states emphatically. ""Not even Robert Kennedy. It was a big deal for all of us. But this was the time, and this was the man."" Accompanied by his wife, Jill, and their youngest son, Brian, Lesh even traveled to Reno to knock on doors, in an effort to get out the vote in Nevada -- a battleground state that ultimately went to Barack Obama. Did anyone recognize him when they answered the door? ""Not really. Reno is not really a stronghold of Dead-dom,"" he deadpans. Lesh downplays the band's legacy as founding fathers of a jam band scene that now includes such free-form artists as Phish, the String Cheese Incident and Blues Traveler. ""All we did was steal what jazz musicians did and apply it to rock 'n' roll. If we didn't do it, someone else would have,"" he says. For the tour, look for The Dead to continue their trademark three-and-a-half to four-hour shows (because of their marathon set, there's no time for an opening act). ""We've been accused of being under-arranged. We've also been accused of noodling,"" says Lesh. ""We make it different, make it new every night. We never play the same licks or the same fills twice. There is a set list -- more or less -- but Bobby, in particular, likes to stick things in."" iReport.com: Spending time with Bob Weir poolside . The upcoming tour will feature mostly ""Grateful Dead classics -- the things people like to hear,"" he says, so expect performances of ""Truckin',"" ""Casey Jones,"" perhaps the band's sole Top 10 hit, ""Touch of Grey,"" and maybe even the Holy Grail of Dead jams, ""Dark Star."" Presale tickets go on sale January 13 -- and even though sold-out shows have been a way of life for The Dead, Lesh isn't taking their fan base for granted. ""It's rough times. Of course it's an object of concern,"" he says. ""All you can do is play the best music you can, and hope people can get out to hear it."" iReport.com: Colorful tie-dyes and painted buses are never out of style . All The Dead's members are in their 60s, with Lesh the elder statesman at 68. Two years ago, he underwent surgery for prostate cancer. ""I'm pretty much recovered from that now. I eat right, exercise and work out with weights three days a week,"" he says. He listens to jazz and classical music in his free time, and continues working on his side project, Phil Lesh and Friends. Two of his musical ""friends"" are his sons, Brian, a student at Princeton, and Grahame, who will be graduating from Stanford this year. Lesh hopes they'll make a guest appearance when The Dead hits their town -- if it doesn't interfere with their finals. iReport.com: Young fan sneaks out for rally show . When The Dead announced this tour, Bob Weir released a statement. ""We've got some unfinished business,"" he said. Lesh goes a step further. ""We've got some unfinished music,"" Lesh clarifies.

"(CNN) -- Carlos Tevez scored twice against his former club as Manchester City claimed  a 2-1 derby triumph over bitter rivals Manchester United in the first leg of the English League Cup semifinal on Tuesday night. The Argentina forward, who left United in acrimonious circumstances after rejecting a new contract at the end of last season, scored in either half to give new manager Roberto Mancini victory over Alex Ferguson in his first derby in charge. Veteran midfielder Ryan Giggs put United ahead in the 17th minute at City's Eastlands Stadium with his first goal in a Manchester derby since 1996, but Tevez leveled from the penalty spot three minutes before halftime and headed the winner in the 65th minute. Mancini took off the man of the match with just over 10 minutes to play, and City had to hold on as United surged forward in search of a second away goal ahead of the second leg at Old Trafford on Wednesday next week. Ferguson field an almost full-strength team for the first time this season in the tournament, which offers a Europa League place for the winners, but the continued absence of injured first-choice central defenders Rio Ferdinand and Nemanja Vidic was apparent in both City goals. Fullback Rafael da Silva was ruled to have twice pulled back Craig Bellamy, the second time inside the area and with seemingly little contact made, as the City striker took advantage of his young opponent's lack of experience. Tevez blasted the ball into the net for his 12th goal in 11 games despite gamesmanship from his former teammates Wayne Rooney and goalkeeper Edwin Van der Sar, who was booked for delaying the spot-kick. Wes Brown and Jonny Evans were then caught out of position as United failed to properly clear a corner, allowing Tevez to dive in with a predatory close-range header from Vincent Kompany's clever hooked cross. Mancini, who left Brazil star Robinho on the bench after putting him on and then taking him off again during Saturday's defeat by Everton, also had an inexperienced defensive line-up as he started with Dedryck Boyata. The 18-year-old Belgian made only his third first-team appearance for City, and could do nothing as goalkeeper Shay Given's reflex save from Rooney's close-range flick hit his arm and fell into the path of Giggs, who made no mistake to put United ahead. Boyata then got in the way of a goal-bound header from central defensive partner Micah Richards later in the first half, and looked a distraught figure when he was finally substituted in the 77th minute. His replacement Nedum Onuoha made a vital contribution as United peppered the City goal, clearing United substitute Michael Owen's scuffed shot off the line with Given grounded after doing well to deny Rooney. Given tipped over another Rooney effort after the England striker jinked into the penalty area with ease, and winger Antonio Valencia should have put Patrice Evra's cross into the net in the 87th minute as he appeared to be distracted by a potential collision with a goalpost -- though replays suggested he was offside anyway. In time added on, Given again got down well to gather a Rooney shot which looked destined to hit the woodwork as City held on for a famous win. Aston Villa take a 1-0 lead into the home second leg of their semifinal against Blackburn this Wednesday.","Carlos Tevez scores twice against his former club as Manchester City beat rivals United .

"Istanbul, Turkey (CNN) -- In colloquial Turkish, the word zenne means male belly dancer. It is also the title of a new film that explores sexual identity while also highlighting a deadly case of homophobia in modern-day Turkey. ""The starting point was a dear friend of ours who was murdered in 2008 for being gay by his own father,"" said Mehmet Binay, producer and co-director of ""Zenne,"" which opens in theaters across Turkey on Friday. Binay was referring to the 2008 killing of Ahmet Yildiz, a 26-year old physics student who was gunned down in Istanbul. Court records identify Yildiz's father, Yahya, as the primary suspect in the killing. The father's motive, according to a copy of the indictment, was that he ""did not accept the victim to be in a gay relationship."" More than three years after the slaying, Yildiz's father is a fugitive, still wanted by Turkish police. The death has since been widely referred to as Turkey's first gay honor killing. One of the main characters in ""Zenne"" is based on Ahmet Yildiz and his tragic story. Caner Alper, the writer and other co-director of ""Zenne,"" was also a friend of Yildiz's. Alper said before he died, Yildiz often spoke about receiving death threats from his family, who were trying to ""cure"" him of his homosexuality. Court documents show Yildiz reported these death threats to the Turkish authorities. In an interview with CNN this week, the filmmakers said they hoped their film would force Turkish society to debate hate crimes that target victims based on gender, religion, ethnicity or sexual identity. ""Death and murder is still on the agenda of our country. We can't get rid of this mentality,"" said Binay. ""People need to tolerate each other. They need to understand that different identities can live next to each other without disturbing each other."" Binay and Alper are not only creative partners. Shortly before the debut of their debut film at the Antalya Golden Orange Film Festival, Turkey's most prestigious film festival, the two men announced they had been a couple for 14 years. Alper said their families advised against coming out publicly. ""They thought it would be career suicide,"" he said. ""Until we won five awards from the first festival that we attended."" Despite recent critical acclaim, the filmmakers agreed Turkey still has a long way to go before it overcomes deeply entrenched institutional homophobia. According to Article 17 of the health regulations of the Turkish Armed Forces, homosexuality is considered a ""psychosexual deviance."" All Turkish men are required to perform military service. But gay men can be exempted from conscript duty provided they first prove their homosexuality. ""Zenne"" depicts the degrading process its main characters endure at an army recruiting center. In the film, military doctors perform anal examinations and hurl homophobic insults at conscripts. They also demand photos of the characters having sex with other men. Gay rights activists say the military has long demanded graphic photo and/or video evidence from men asking to be released from military duty. ""In the photograph and the video you have to show your form and your face. Your face has to be clearly identified and another man has to be penetrating,"" said Kursad Kahramanoglu, who teaches international law and human sexuality at Istanbul's Bilgi University. CNN asked Turkey's defense ministry to comment on what gay rights groups claim has long been an unwritten military policy. ""The practice of asking for video and photographic evidence is out of question,"" a defense ministry spokesman responded, speaking on condition of anonymity, a common practice in Turkish government bureaucracy. ""I cannot confirm that it definitely did not happen, but we do not have any information that such a thing happened,"" he added. The spokesman said the current policy is for conscripts to prove their homosexuality with a doctor's report from a private or military hospital. ""The evaluation is made based on the medical report,"" he said. Less than two years ago, a senior Turkish government minister was quoted in an interview calling homosexuality ""an illness ... that should be treated."" These types of statements have not stopped members of Turkey's lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender community from demanding equal rights. Thousands marched in a rainbow-hued gay pride parade through downtown Istanbul last July. Some of the activists carried large posters of Ahmet Yildiz with the slogan ""get the murderer."" Among those marching was Yildiz's former boyfriend, Ibrahim Can. ""I am fighting for the rights of my lover and for all the gays and lesbians and transsexuals in the world and in Turkey. And I want the Turkish government to change the homophobic attitude in Turkey,"" Can said in an interview with CNN. LGBT activists are lobbying the Turkish government to have the constitution amended to protect the rights of Turks on the grounds of gender and sexual identity. The Turkish Constitution is currently in the lengthy process of being re-written. Binay, meanwhile, points to what he calls remarkable progress for minority rights in Turkey over the last decade. He said: ""All sorts of minorities including gays and lesbians are demanding their rights. They want recognition, they want protection by the state. They want to be able to live, first of all, and not be murdered.""","New Turkish movie highlights homophobia in the country .

"(CNN) -- He was once a prized asset chased by a host of Europe's top clubs but after months in the wilderness at Italian giants Inter Milan, Wesley Sneijder has opted to join Turkish club Galatasaray. The midfielder, who was part of the Netherlands' side that lost the 2010 World Cup final to Spain, has joined the Istanbul-based outfit in a deal thought to be worth around $10 million. Sneijder, a former Real Madrid player, is due to fly into Istanbul to be paraded in front of the club's notoriously loyal and vociferous fans on Monday. The 28-year-old last played for Inter back in September and had been linked with English clubs Liverpool and Manchester United, but he has opted for a move to the less regarded Turkish league instead. In quotes posted on Galatasaray's official Twitter feed Sneijder said: ""I am very happy with my agreement with Galatasaray. ""I can't wait to wear the Galatasaray shirt. I know that Turkish people are very passionate about football. I feel in good shape and hope to already play in the next match against Besiktas. ""I heard a lot about Coach Fatih Terim and know his career in Italy well. It will be good to work finally work together. Turkish? I hope to learn it soon."" Sneijder also thanked Inter's fans on his official Twitter page: ""Bye Milan, thanks for everything ... Always in my heart! Thanks to all the fans. On my way to Istanbul now ... Excited!"" The club also confirmed the deal had been completed on their Twitter account and their official website, over a week after they agreed a fee with Inter, the 2010 European Champions League winners. A statement on the Gala Twitter feed read: ""An agreement with Inter Milan and Wesley Sneijder for the transfer has been agreed. The conditions of the deal will be made public and the player will sign the contract after health checks.''","Wesley Sneijder leaves Inter Milan to join Turkish club Galatasaray .

"Cairo (CNN) -- During a historic trip to Egypt, Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad was greeted by a group of men who hurled shoes at him -- a major insult in the Muslim world. A video posted by the Anadolu news agency shows a smiling Ahmadinejad shaking hands with a crowd of supporters in Cairo late Tuesday when at least one man threw a shoe toward him. Other men also threw shoes at Ahmadinejad, the Egyptian public prosecutor's office said. ""You killed our brothers!"" one of the assailants shouted, according to Anadolu. The agency said the man's shoe struck a security guard. The men behind the attack were four Salafis, the prosecutor's office said. Salafis follow the Sunni Muslim doctrine and oppose the idea of Shiite Muslims engaging in any political activity in Egypt. They have accused Iran of financing Shiites to spread the Shia doctrine in Egypt, which has a Sunni majority. The four men were released on bail for 500 Egyptian pounds ($75) each, the prosecutors' office said. Ahmadinejad's visit to Egypt is the first by an Iranian president in more than 30 years. He was in Cairo visiting the Grand Sheikh of Al Azhar, Ahmed el-Tayeb. The Al-Ahram news agency said Ahmadinejad also visited the historic Al-Hussein mosque. The mosque was built in 1154 and it is named after the Prophet Mohammed's grandson, Hussein Ibn Ali. Shiites believe that the Fatimid, Egypt's Shiite rulers, buried his head there and built the mosque as a shrine for Hussein, the first Shiite martyr, who was killed and beheaded in the battle of Karbala in 680. Why shoe throwing is 'incredibly offensive' CNN's Saad Abedine contributed to this report.","This is the first visit to Egypt by an Iranian president in more than 30 years .

"(CNN) -- A suspect in the death of a transgender woman in New Jersey has turned himself in, authorities said, and a second suspect remains at large. Marquise L. Foster, 25, surrendered to Essex County officials Saturday night. Authorities are searching for Alrashim N. Chambers, 23, of Newark. The two are suspects in the killing of Victoria Carmen White, 28, of Newark, who was fatally shot on September 12 at an apartment in Maplewood, police said in a statement. Maplewood is a half-hour drive west of New York City. Foster and Chambers met the victim at a nightclub and returned with her and two other people to the apartment, police said. White was killed after an altercation at the apartment, authorities said. Last week, after police announced the arrest of a suspect in the March killing of an openly gay man in Maplewood, authorities said sexual orientation could be a factor in both killings. John Staten, 30, is accused in the March killing of Arthur Downey, 27, who was found beaten to death in bed in his Maplewood apartment. ""What the prosecutor said today is their sexual orientation may have been a factor in their deaths,"" Katherine Carter, a spokeswoman for the Essex County prosecutor, said last week. Arthur Downey, 27, was openly gay, Carter said. ""We have a special unit that looks at cases to determine whether there is a legal basis to bring bias-crime charges, and that unit within our office will be reviewing both of these cases."" Garden State Equality, a gay rights organization, decried the attacks and announced a $2,000 reward for information leading to the arrests of the suspects in White's murder.

"Orlando (CNN) -- The family of Robert Champion, who died in November after he was beaten on a bus, allegedly as part of a Florida A&M University band hazing ritual, will sue the bus company, their attorney said Tuesday. The bus and its air conditioning system is believed to have been running at the time Champion was beaten, attorney Chris Chestnut said, and the bus driver might not have been aboard. The family is suing Fabulous Coach Lines, based in Branford, Florida, he said. ""We do anticipate, in the very near future, filing a legal action against the bus company alleging negligence and wrongful death,"" Chestnut told reporters at a news conference Tuesday. Such a lawsuit will allow him to file subpoenas and take witness statements to further the investigation, he said. Part of that investigation will include determining what bus company employee was assigned to the bus, how it was running and how an estimated 30 people were on the bus long enough for Champion to be beaten to death. FAMU is protected under sovereign immunity, and the family must file a statutory notice of intent to sue and wait six months to file suit against the school, Chestnut said. Ray Land, president of Fabulous Coach Lines, told CNN the company's employees, who were not on the bus at the time, responded quickly after learning there was an emergency -- even following the ambulance transporting Champion to the hospital, taking other band members there. ""We did transport our passengers safely from point A to point B as contracted,"" Land said. When employees were notified of an emergency on board one of the nine buses in the convoy, ""we responded just as quickly and effectively as we could."" The company has already received some documents, he said, and ""we're addressing those with our lawyers now."" Asked if a company employee was on the bus at the time of Champion's beating, he said a driver was not in the seat on the bus, but the drivers had congregated together looking over the nine vehicles. The drivers rushed over to the bus after learning of a problem, he said. Some band members have said Champion, 26, died after taking part in a rite of passage called ""crossing Bus C."" One band member, who spoke on condition of anonymity, previously explained that students ""walk from the front of the bus to the back of the bus backward while the bus is full of other band members, and you get beaten until you get to the back."" Chestnut said Tuesday he's heard the ritual may have happened before on Fabulous Coach Lines. However, Land said the bus company has ""never seen this kind of behavior"" from the band previously. ""It's completely out of the blue,"" he said of the lawsuit. ""It wasn't an auto accident. It wasn't a crash. If two passengers get in a fight, and one gets injured, I don't know how that's the motorcoach company's liability."" Chestnut said his team has spoken to ""in excess of 15 people"" during the preliminary investigation. Friends of Champion have told Chestnut during his investigation that Champion was gay, the attorney said. Relatives believe that may have been one of many factors that contributed to his being treated more severely than other band members, Chestnut said. However, he said, Champion's homosexuality is not believed to have been a primary factor in the beating. ""This is not a hate crime. This is a hazing crime,"" he said. ""Florida A&M University has a 50-year history, a culture in this band, of hazing."" The family thinks some people might have been jealous of Champion, a stickler for the rules who stood up against hazing, he said. ""Robert Champion was defined by the fact that he followed the rules,"" Chestnut said. Champion also may have been about to become the band's lead drum major, Chestnut said. Band director Julian White, who's on administrative leave from his post, said at Champion's funeral November 30 he regretted not telling him he had been selected to be the band's next head drum major. Champion's mother, Pam, told reporters Tuesday her son ""loved his music. He loved the band. He was very serious about how he did and the position he was in."" Champion collapsed in Orlando on the bus, which was carrying members of FAMU's Marching 100 after a November football game that included a halftime performance by the group. Chestnut has charged that Champion died after receiving ""some dramatic blows, perhaps (having an) elevated heart rate"" tied to ""a hazing ritual"" that took place on the bus. The medical examiner's office ruled his death a homicide and said Champion ""collapsed and died within an hour of a hazing incident during which he suffered multiple blunt trauma blows to his body."" An autopsy conducted after his death found ""extensive contusions of his chest, arms, shoulder and back,"" as well as ""evidence of crushing of areas of subcutaneous fat,"" which is the fatty tissue directly under the skin. ""When a crime victim is targeted because of his or her identity, it can have devastating effects on communities,"" said Michael Cole-Schwartz, spokesman for the Human Rights Campaign. ""The allegation that Robert Champion may have been singled out because of who he was must be thoroughly investigated and prosecuted accordingly."" The death prompted the FAMU board of trustees to approve a new three-part anti-hazing plan. The new policy was passed in a 9-1 vote by the board last week as the school continues to deal with the controversial death. Champion's mother told reporters she wants hazing to stop. ""Think twice when your kids are going off to college,"" she said. ""Look into what's going on at their college ... Now we know."" Along with the university, the Florida Department of Law Enforcement and the Orange County Sheriff's Office are also investigating the case. Chestnut said law enforcement has not contacted Champion's family and they don't know the status of the criminal investigation. The Florida Department of Law Enforcement has launched a separate investigation into some school employees, who were allegedly engaged in financial fraud.

"London (CNN) -- Prime Minister David Cameron blames the riots that shook Britain over the past 10 days on a ""slow-motion moral collapse ... in parts of our country,"" he said Monday, as police arrested a new suspect linked with one of the deadliest incidents in the violence. Cameron listed problems including ""Irresponsibility. Selfishness. Behaving as if your choices have no consequences. Children without fathers. Schools without discipline. Reward without effort. Crime without punishment. Rights without responsibilities. Communities without control,"" in a speech in his constituency in Oxfordshire. And he promised that the government will ""review every aspect of our work to mend our broken society"" in the coming weeks. Thousands of people have been arrested and processed through courts working around the clock since violence erupted over the killing of a man in London during a police operation. Police in London announced Monday they had arrested 1,593 people over violence, disorder and looting since riots broke out just over a week ago. Some 926 of those people have been charged, they said. Police released video footage from a closed-circuit TV camera that showed what was described in a news release as ""the attempted murder of two police officers as they chased looters"" August 8. The footage, which showed officers being hit by a speeding car that ran at several officers in a street, was released in hopes that it could lead to the identity of those in the car, police said. ""One officer was struck so hard that some of his body armour came off and (he) can clearly be seen lying in the middle of the road after the collision,"" the news release said. Both injured officers are recuperating, the release said. In a separate news release, Metropolitan police singled out the work of the department's dog unit -- and one dog specifically -- for commendation. The release said 30 to 40 dogs from the unit were sent out nightly to work with police officers. Obi, a 3-year-old German Shepherd, was hit by a thrown brick, sustained multiple skull fractures and received emergency treatment ""at various London veterinary clinics,"" the release said. The dog is recuperating, but expected to be out of service for several months. ""Obi, like all our dogs, showed incredible bravery in the face of the mass disorder,"" Constable Phil Wells of the Dog Support Unit said in the release. ""All Met dogs receive the best possible training to help them cope with the most dangerous of situations, but this week has tested them and us to the limit."" Metropolitan police arrested a suspect late Sunday over the killing of another man during the ensuing riot. The 24-year-old was the sixth person arrested in connection with the shooting of Trevor Ellis in the London neighborhood of Croydon on August 8. And police in Birmingham arrested a man Monday in connection with the hit-and-run deaths of three other men during the riots. The 30-year-old man, who was not named, is the seventh person held in the incident. Three other men, aged 17, 23 and 26, are in custody awaiting further court hearings, and another three suspects are free on bail pending further investigation, West Midlands Police said Monday. Residents say the three victims in the hit-and-run in Birmingham were mowed down by a car while protecting businesses from looters in Britain's second-largest city. Haroon Jahan, 21, along with two brothers, Shazad and Munir Hussein -- both in their 30s -- were keeping watch outside a gas station following a break-in by looters during the riots, relatives said. ""The guy who killed him drove directly into the crowd and killed three innocent guys,"" said Tarik Jahan, father of the youngest victim. ""Why? What was the point of doing that? I don't understand."" ""All they wanted to do was to protect their business and other businesses within the community,"" said Abdullah Khan, an uncle of the two brothers, on Saturday. Shazad Hussein was looking forward to the birth of his first child in a few months, the uncle said. ""A father will never hold his child, a child will never be held by his father, a wife without a husband, parents who have lost two sons. Words can never express what we are going through at this moment,"" he said. Khan appealed for justice, and asked witnesses to come forward. Birmingham, like many other areas in Britain, was rocked by riots that started after the shooting death of a man who protesters said was killed by police. The violence first broke out on August 6 following protests over the death of Mark Duggan in the north London neighborhood of Tottenham. He was shot after a police unit that deals with gun crime stopped a cab carrying the 29-year-old father of four. CNN's Bharati Naik, Alex Felton, Elizabeth Joseph and Faith Karimi contributed to this report.","Police release video footage of two officers hit by car during London riots .

"Islamabad, Pakistan(CNN) -- Pakistan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs summoned Britain's high commissioner for talks Monday, less than a week after British Prime Minister David Cameron criticized the country's handing of terrorism. ""We can confirm that the British High Commissioner to Pakistan, Mr. Adam Thomson, is meeting this morning with Foreign Minister Qureshi at the request of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs,"" the British Foreign Office in London said Monday. The outcome of the session was not immediately clear. Pakistani President Asif Ali Zardari has said he will proceed with a scheduled visit to the United Kingdom this week despite Cameron's remarks, a government official said. ""There is no reason to bark at each other. We have had good relations in the past and we want to progress our relations,"" Pakistan Information Minister Qamar Zaman Kaira said Saturday. Kaira's remarks to reporters in London, England, came after a Pakistani military official confirmed that the country's spy chief's planned visit to the U.K. had been canceled after Cameron told an audience in India that Pakistan shouldn't export terror. ""We want to see a strong and a stable and a democratic Pakistan,"" Cameron said in Bangalore, India on Wednesday, ""But we cannot tolerate in any sense the idea that this country is allowed to look both ways and is able in any way to promote the export of terror, whether to India or whether to Afghanistan, or anywhere else in the world."" Kaira described Cameron's statement as a ""misperception"" that was ""against the facts"" and ""not in good taste,"" but he said he expected the bilateral meetings between Pakistan President Asif Ali Zardari and U.K. officials this week to be fruitful. ""The president of Pakistan will have dialogue and good discussion, and he will explain the facts to the new government over here,"" he said. Some critics in Pakistan have called for the president to cancel his visit. One group of protesters burned an effigy of Cameron. Gen. Ahmed Shujaa Pasha, the head of Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence, planned to visit Britain in early August to discuss security cooperation between the two countries. But the trip was scuttled after Cameron's comments, according to a Pakistani military official, who asked not to be named because he was not supposed to talk to the media. Kaira said Saturday that the trip had been postponed due to other commitments.","British prime minister has been critical of Pakistan's handling of terrorism .

"(CNN) -- British Prime Minister David Cameron and a contingent of ministers and business leaders arrived in Beijing Tuesday as part of a tour to boost bilateral trade with the world's second-largest economy. ""This week I am leading one of the biggest and most high-powered British delegations ever to visit China,"" Cameron said in a piece written for the Wall Street Journal. ""We aim to deliver more than 40 specific agreements across the whole range of our bilateral relationship, from trade to low-carbon growth, to cultural and education initiatives,"" he said in the piece that appeared Tuesday. ""All of it, seeking to take Britain's relationship with China to a new level and to achieve strong co-operation on our shared economic and political interests."" ""It is the biggest delegation ever to China, led by a British Prime Minister,"" Sebastian Wood, British ambassador to China, told a press briefing in the embassy prior to the visit, according to China's Xinhua news agency. Wood said discussions will be held on a wide range of topics including trade, finance, energy and education. ""We will announce new agreements to develop co-operation on international energy supply and a new U.K.-China partnership scheme to promote low-carbon growth. We will aim to enhance cooperation in Africa and enhance China's peacekeeping capacity,"" Cameron said. ""We will discuss our shared interests in international security. We want to work with China to help in global efforts to prevent Iran acquiring a nuclear weapon, and to put pressure on corrupt and intolerant regimes in Africa. We hope we can work closely together to prevent conflagration in North Korea and to improve the situation for the Burmese people."" Cameron's visit to China is his first as prime minister. China reported last year that it recorded an 8.7 percent growth in its gross domestic product -- a broad mesaure of economic output -- defying global economic trends. Over the last 30 years, China's economic growth has averaged nearly 10 percent, surpassing Japan and moving into the No. 2 spot behind the United States. ""We are working to agree a new target to double the value of our bilateral trade with China by 2015 to more than $100 billion a year,"" Cameron said. ""And within this we intend to raise U.K. exports to China to $30 billion per year over the same period.""","Large British delegation visits China to talk trade .

"London, England (CNN) -- British Prime Minister David Cameron and his wife, Samantha, announced Tuesday the birth of their fourth child, a baby girl. The baby was born by Caesarean section at the Royal Cornwall Hospital in Truro, southwestern England, at midday. She had been due next month. The baby weighed 2.75 kilograms (6 pounds, 1 ounce), and both the baby and mother are ""doing very well,"" Cameron's office at Downing Street said in a statement. The child had been expected in September. The Camerons already have two young children, Arthur and Nancy. Their oldest child, Ivan, was severely disabled and died last year at age 6. Samantha Cameron was visibly pregnant during the campaign that brought her husband to power in May. She scaled back her hours as creative director at luxury brand Smythson after the election. ""It was very exciting, we were on holiday, thought we were going to get through the holiday and then have a baby, and then it just seemed to kick off a bit quickly,"" Cameron told reporters outside the hospital after the birth. ""Samantha woke up this morning and thought she was having contractions and it was all beginning to get going, so we thought we would come to the hospital just to get everything checked out, and then things sort of sped up and it all happened very, very quickly and the baby popped out at about 12 o'clock."" He added: ""It was a bit of a shock. We're absolutely thrilled.

"New Delhi, India (CNN) -- Britain's prime minister delivered a sober message Wednesday to Pakistan: Don't export terror. ""We want to see a strong and a stable and a democratic Pakistan,"" David Cameron said in Bangalore, India, ""but we cannot tolerate in any sense the idea that this country is allowed to look both ways and is able in any way to promote the export of terror, whether to India or whether to Afghanistan, or anywhere else in the world."" Cameron made several remarks in a speech and a question and answer session. A transcript of his comments were posted on the prime minister's website. ""The relationship is important, but it should be a relationship based on a very clear message that it is not right ... to have any relationship with groups that are promoting terror. Democratic states that want to be part of the developed world cannot do that, and the message to Pakistan from the U.S. and from the U.K. is very clear on that point,"" he said. His remarks come as the military documents divulged by WikiLeaks include indications that Pakistan's spy service, the Directorate of Inter-Services Intelligence, or the ISI, may have been helping militants in Afghanistan, an assertion strongly disputed by Pakistani officials. The United States has been working to help bolster the Pakistani government's efforts to battle Taliban and al Qaeda elements in the country. The NATO-led command has been focused on insurgents operating along the Afghan and Pakistani border, and India has long been concerned about militancy in India that comes from Pakistan. He also said that India and Britain must work closer on security, saying ""the terrorists we face are adept at crossing borders, communicating globally, and concocting the most abhorrent plans to destroy our way of life."" ""Five years ago, 52 people were killed on the tube and on a bus in London. And in November 2008, we watched in horror as terrorists went on the rampage in Mumbai, killing scores of Indians and three British nationals. As you know, we worked with your government in the investigation into these events,"" Cameron said. ""We remain determined that those responsible must be brought to justice."" He said that when it comes to protecting their mutual citizenry, developments in Afghanistan and Pakistan can't be ""overlooked."" ""Let me state clearly: your relations with those two countries are a matter for you and you alone. But let me also say we, like you, want a Pakistan that is stable, democratic and free from terror. We, like you, want an Afghanistan that is secure, free from interference from its neighbors and not a threat to our security. We, like you, are determined that groups like the Taliban, the Haqqani network or Lashkar-e-Tayyiba should not be allowed to launch attacks on Indian and British citizens in India or in Britain. Neither should they be able to do so against our people, whether soldiers or civilians, from both our countries who are working for peace in Afghanistan. Our interests are your interests, so let us work together to realize them."" When asked about Cameron's remarks, a spokesman for Pakistan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs said Britain and Pakistan ""have a robust and comprehensive partnership, including on counter-terrorism."" ""Terrorists have no religion, no humanity, no specific ethnicity or geography. Terrorists' networks, as the U.K. knows full well mutate and operate in different regions and cities. The genesis of terrorism as a global phenomenon warrants close attention. Pakistan is as much a victim of terrorism as are Afghanistan, India or other countries,"" the statement said. ""Pakistan has done much more than any other country in combating terrorism. Our people and security forces have rendered innumerable sacrifices. We hope that our friends will be able to persuade India to view this issue objectively and the value of 'cooperation' in counter-terrorism."" Pakistan has a troubled history with India, and in the past India has accused the ISI of supporting militant separatists in Indian-administered Kashmir. Pakistan and Afghanistan also have a tumultuous past. During the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan in the 1980s, religious schools in Pakistan helped train fighters who battled the Soviets. After the Taliban took over Afghanistan in 1996 and imposed fundamentalist rule, Pakistan was one of the few countries that recognized the regime diplomatically. It dropped its support after the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks on Washington and New York. Lashkar-e-Tayyiba, which means ""Army of the Pure,"" was blamed for the November 2008 Mumbai attack in which nearly 200 people were killed over three days. The man regarded as the group's leader says it wasn't involved in the act despite evidence to the contrary. Experts say that group claims it is focused on the same issue as it was when created: freeing the disputed territory of Kashmir from Indian rule -- a dispute that has been the source of great tension between India and Pakistan for decades. Security isn't the only item on Cameron's agenda. He intends to boost business and trade ties, and will meet Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh on Thursday. Cameron visited Turkey a day earlier, where he pushed for Turkish membership in the European Union and also addressed world crises including the tensions in the Palestinian territory of Gaza, which he labeled a ""prison.""","NEW: Pakistan says it too is a victim of terrorism .

"London (CNN) -- British Prime Minister David Cameron Wednesday announced a reduction in the British troop level in Afghanistan, removing 500 service members by the end of next year. In remarks to the House of Commons, Cameron said the move will bring the troop level to 9,000, and more reductions will be carried out in the coming years. ""We are now entering a new phase in which the Afghan forces will do more of the fighting and patrolling, and our forces more training and mentoring,"" Cameron said. ""As President Obama said in his address last month, the mission is changing from combat to support."" Cameron emphasized the move ""marks the start of a process which will ensure that by the end of 2014 there will not be anything like the number of British troops there as there are now -- and they will not be serving in a combat role."" After 2014, he said, Britain will have a ""major strategic relationship with Afghanistan,"" involving development, training, diplomacy and trade. ""Above all, we have a vital national security interest in preventing Afghanistan from once again becoming a safe haven for international terrorism. So although forces will not long be present in a combat role, we will have a continuing military relationship,"" he said. The announcement was made on the eve of the sixth anniversary of the July 7 terror attack in London, and Cameron makes the point that the attack was ""inspired by al Qaeda and executed by extremists following the same perverted ideology that underpinned the September 11th attack in 2001."" Cameron noted that international troops have been putting pressure on al Qaeda and the Taliban in Pakistan and Afghanistan, pointed out the killing of al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden, and cited the weakening of al Qaeda. He also said there's evidence to indicate that the Taliban's ""momentum"" in Helmand province -- in which British troops have been based -- has been stopped. ""In 2009, my predecessor told this House that some three-quarters of the most serious terrorist plots against Britain had links to Afghanistan and Pakistan. We must always be on our guard, but I am advised that this figure is now significantly reduced,"" Cameron said. The planned reduction comes as other countries also make preparations for drawdowns and shift to plans for non-combat missions in Afghanistan, such as training. U.S. President Barack Obama recently announced the withdrawal of 33,000 American troops by the end of next year. France announced that it would also begin to reduce troop numbers, saying it ""will initiate a progressive withdrawal of troops in Afghanistan, and will follow a timetable comparable to the withdrawal of the American troops."" Canada this week is ending its combat mission in Afghanistan and transitioning to a training role. Britain's 500-troop reduction does not include the previously announced plan to withdraw 426 British military personnel by February. Along with the military strides, Cameron said the Afghanistan security forces have been making great improvements. For example, he cited their handling of the aftermath of the Kabul hotel attack last week. ""The Afghan forces dealt with it professionally and speedily, only calling in assistance from a NATO helicopter to deal with insurgents on the roof,"" Cameron said. Britain has long had the second-largest contingent in NATO's International Security Assistance Force, the coalition that has been fighting militants in Afghanistan. The United States has the largest. The number of British troops who have died in Afghanistan stands at 375. The latest was on Monday, when Scott McLaren, from D Company, The Highlanders, 4th Battalion The Royal Regiment of Scotland, was killed. He had been reported missing and was found later Monday after an ""extensive search,"" the Defence Ministry said.","Prime Minister David Cameron said the troop level will drop to 9,000 .

"Kabul, Afghanistan (CNN) -- NATO's goal of ending combat operations in Afghanistan and leaving security in local hands by the end of 2014 is realistic, British Prime Minister David Cameron said Tuesday on his second visit to the nation in 2010. ""It's challenging, but it is achievable,"" Cameron said. ""What I see is actually some grounds for cautious optimism."" Cameron cited the continued training of the Afghan National Army and the nation's police force, noting 500 police officers are coming out of a British-run police academy every eight weeks. ""There are more markets open, more children going to school, local governors providing legitimate governance with the local population rejecting the brutal shadow (of the) Taliban regime,"" Cameron said during a joint news conference with Afghan President Hamid Karzai. In the same conference, Cameron addressed the international WikiLeaks situation. WikiLeaks, which facilitates the anonymous leaking of secret information, has been under intense pressure from the United States and its allies since it began posting the first of more than 250,000 U.S. State Department documents on November 28. ""I don't want the WikiLeaks to come between our strong relationship. Some of what was referred to was the fact that there was not enough troops in Helmand province in the past, and that is certainly true,"" Cameron said. ""It's clear that we did not have enough troops in Helmand to actually deliver the security that was necessary."" But Cameron added, ""I think you can now see on the ground with 20,000 U.S. Marines, with some 10,000 U.K. forces, you really can see a density of forces that are able to deliver security to the vast majority of the people."" Karzai, who said WikiLeaks documents have ""some truth and some not so truth in them,"" replied in a less serious tone. ""On a lighter side, you should wait for the WikiLeaks from Britain so our conversation with Britain's leaked on America,"" the Afghan president said, drawing laughter from the British prime minister. ""We're very nice about that, just to be clear,"" Cameron said. ""Most of the time,"" Karzai quipped. NATO has some 150,000 troops in Afghanistan, pressing the fight against the Taliban and al Qaeda. About 9,500 of the forces are British, according to the country's Ministry of Defence. During the joint press conference, Karzai expressed his gratitude to Britain. ""Britain has been as steadfast supporter of Afghanistan and of the Afghan people,"" Karzai said. ""Britain has contributed in the sacrifice of its soldiers, of blood and of resources in Afghanistan for which the Afghan people are extremely grateful. You have been operating as a British army and trainers and civilians in a very difficult part of the country. We fully understand and appreciate the hard work that you are doing."" Gen. David Petraeus, the top commander in Afghanistan, has stepped up attacks on militants since taking over the command in June and is seeing progress as a result. In an October interview with CNN, he said he expects to be able to recommend to U.S. President Barack Obama that the number of U.S. troops in Afghanistan could start being reduced beginning in July 2011. But Petraeus declined to say how many troops might be headed home. Cameron said he shares a similar optimism, adding he believes some British troops could start heading home before Christmas 2011. ""I think that it's possible,"" he said. ""We have to deliver on the ground what's necessary."" Cameron said British forces are ahead of schedule in training the Afghan army. ""We have a very clear timetable for transition in Afghanistan. It's going to take place between now and 2014,"" the prime minister said. ""All of NATO has signed up to that.

"Cairo (CNN) -- Hosni Mubarak should be tried by a special tribunal because he is still president of Egypt and did not sign an official resignation, his lawyer said Sunday. ""He gave up the presidency orally to former vice-president Omar Suleiman without signing any official document, which is not legal by the constitution,"" lawyer Farid El Deeb said. The court proceedings were recounted to CNN by civil rights lawyer Khaled Abu Bakr, who attended the hearing. A former head of an Egyptian lawyers' organization said Mubarak is not the president. ""The revolution revokes the constitution,"" Zakaria Abdel Aziz said. ""The Egyptian people said their word ... this is a nation that had a vice president at the time and this is an ousted president."" The trial was adjourned until Monday, when lawyers will start their defense of the former interior minister, who faces charges with Mubarak and his sons. Last week, El Deeb called for Mubarak to be tried in a military court, saying military law dictates that he is still the head of the Egyptian air force. Mubarak is accused of corruption and ordering protesters killed during the country's uprising that brought his 30-year rule to an end in February. He has denied the charges. Two of Mubarak's sons are also on trial on a variety of charges. The sons, Gamal and Alaa, have pleaded not guilty. Amnesty International had estimated more than 840 protesters were killed and 6,000 injured. A prosecutor's spokesman cited 225 people killed and more than 1,300 injured, saying the number is lower because there is a difference between those killed while attacking police stations and those shot while protesting.","NEW: ""The Egyptian people said their word ... this is an ousted president,"" analyst says .

"(CNN) -- Images beamed around the world last week of unruly and provocative protests by indigenous Australians projected a portrait of an angry and disenfranchised group. The protesters thumped on the windows of a restaurant where Prime Minister Julia Gillard had been attending a ceremony, prompting security officers to rush her out of the building. They also burned the Australian flag in front of Parliament. Those actions have provoked alarm and introspection in Australia about the relationship of the indigenous population with society as a whole. And they have stirred controversy at a delicate time: The country is considering the possibility of changing the wording of its Constitution to give better recognition to indigenous Australians. The protests also gave a misleading impression of the complex role Aborigines play in Australian society. Many commentators -- both Aborigine and non-Aborigine -- have been quick to stress that the protests involved a small number of people and do not represent the views of the broader indigenous Australian population of about half a million people. ""The Aborigines that I recognized in the television reportage of the protests don't really have a role in the Aboriginal community.,"" said Marcia Langton, the head of Australian indigenous studies at the University of Melbourne. ""They're the disaffected fringe. They have no serious platform or serious demands."" The protesters were part of a long-running Aboriginal demonstration known as the ""tent embassy,"" which was set up 40 years ago to protest the failure of the government at the time to recognize Aboriginal land rights. Some of the protesters also reportedly expressed anger last week about the violence and discrimination toward Aborigines that marked a large portion of Australian history. The Australian authorities have taken steps to try to address their grievances in recent decades through measures like legal recognition of land rights, the removal of sections considered racist from the Constitution and an apology for the mistreatment of past generations of Aborigines. Governments have also poured billions of dollars of public money into programs to try to improve life in indigenous communities. Despite those measures, many indigenous Australians still lag behind the overall population in key areas like health, wealth and education. They also appear to perceive a lack of trust in their relationship with their non-Aboriginal countrymen. Indigenous Australians, who make up less than 2.5% of the overall population, are much more likely to suffer child abuse, physical violence and chronic disease than other Australians, according to government statistics. Research suggests they have a lower life expectancy than indigenous populations in North America and New Zealand. ""Past approaches to remedying Indigenous disadvantage have clearly failed, and new approaches are needed for the future,"" said a government report made public last year. The report said that the 3.5 billion Australian dollars, or $3.75 billion, spent annually on programs for indigenous people had ""yielded dismally poor returns."" A survey of 1,220 Australians carried out in 2010 by Reconciliation Australia, which promotes the improving of relationships between Aborigines and the wider community, found that 85% of indigenous people polled had ""fairly low"" or ""very low"" levels of trust toward other Australians. And 91% of the indigenous respondents said they believed that other Australians had ""fairly low"" or ""very low"" levels of trust toward them. Similarly, high levels of non-Aboriginal Australians also saw the relationships as distrustful, according to the survey. Some observers, however, say that to speak of indigenous Australians simply as a disadvantaged people separate from the broader society is neither accurate nor helpful. ""Aboriginal people are not a homogeneous cultural group anymore"" said Peter Sutton, an anthropologist and linguist at the University of Adelaide and the South Australian Museum. He noted that while some indigenous Australians live in remote communities that maintain aspects of traditional life, others make up a large and growing middle class in more urban areas. ""Many Aboriginal people drive good cars and have children at university. These are not people in the gutter, they've made it,"" said Sutton, whose book ""The Politics of Suffering"" examined the failings of past efforts to tackle indigenous disadvantage. To illustrate the blurring of the boundaries, Sutton highlighted Australian census data that showed the proportion of indigenous people whose partners or spouses were recorded as non-indigenous has been increasing steadily, from 46% in 1986 to 71.5% in 2006. Despite this nuanced situation, the striking images of the protests last week, which took place during the sensitive period around Australia's national day, brought underlying tensions to the fore. The events ""opened up fissures in our society and taught us lessons that stretch far beyond the crucial issue of indigenous affairs,"" The Australian, a national daily, said in an editorial at the weekend. On Twitter and in letters to newspapers, Australians argued over the causes and consequences of the fracas. Some people criticized Tony Abbott, the opposition leader whose comments about the tent embassy were cited by protesters as the provocation for their actions. Others, such as Frank Pulsford in a letter published by The Australian, expressed outrage over what he called the ""disgraceful behavior"" of the protesters. The news that one of Gillard's media advisers was involved in informing the protesters about Abbott's comments and presence in the restaurant with the prime minister only served to intensify the polemic. The adviser, Tony Hodges, has since resigned. The rancorous debate reflected battle lines that had already been drawn. ""The indigenous affairs scene is this country has become much more riven, much more conflictual and much more polarized in recent years,"" Sutton said. He said the disagreements are not simply between Aborigines and non-Aborigines, but between different sides within the indigenous community and among groups outside it. Several commentators noted that a considerable number of the people participating in the protests last week were not Aborigines. Much of the contention focuses on the diagnosis of the ills affecting parts of the Aboriginal community, and on how best to cure them. Certain policies, like the federal government's decision in 2007 to intervene in Aboriginal communities in the Northern Territory to address child abuse, have proved particularly divisive. The intervention included seizures of Aboriginal land, restrictions on alcohol and the suspension of race discrimination legislation. Some prominent indigenous Australians, such as Barbara Shaw, have campaigned vigorously against the intervention, saying it misrepresents the real situation in Aboriginal communities and is a form of ""dictatorship"" by the central government . Others, such as Langton, have supported it, arguing that the social problems that many communities face necessitate the strong measures. ""There are very difficult problems to solve,"" Langton said. ""A big part of the change must come from Aboriginal people themselves. They have to change their behavior to take advantage of the opportunities available to them, like sending children to school every day."" One of the most immediate concerns after the protests last week is their potential effect on tentative plans to hold a referendum on changing the Constitution to include better recognition of indigenous Australians, a move many people see as a positive step. Newspaper columnists and Aboriginal leaders expressed concern that the media furor over the protesters' actions would jeopardize the prospect of a referendum on constitutional change, which would require broad bipartisan support to pass. The government has so far suggested that it has not been dissuaded. ""I believe that opportunity for us all to share in building a movement of change is still there,"" Jenny Macklin, the minister for indigenous affairs, wrote in an editorial this week for The Age, a daily newspaper. ""It is part of the enduring work we are all undertaking, and that work is bigger than the headlines generated by one incident.""","Protests involving Aborigines last week prompt introspection and alarm in Australia .

"Cairo (CNN) -- Voting in Egypt's first elections since the ouster of former President Hosni Mubarak will begin in late November, a week later than previously announced, the ruling Supreme Council of the Armed Forces said Tuesday. Egypt's military rulers said the first phase of parliamentary elections will begin November 28. The elections will take place in three stages across different districts, the ruling Supreme Council of the Armed Forces said. ""The results will be announced on January 10. Then the writing of the constitution will begin immediately, "" said Major Alaa Al Iraqi, a spokesman for the Council. ""Parliament's first session should be in March. Then the presidential elections will come next."" The January 25 revolution -- a movement of several political groups, named after the revolution that ousted Mubarak -- had warned that if the Council did not announce a specific date and mechanism for the elections, it would stage an open-ended sit-in on September 30. The group also stressed that the military must secure the polls to avoid violence and allow a mechanism for Egyptian living abroad to participate. The Supreme Council has announced that "" international agencies and NGOs are welcome to observe the elections."" Since an 18-day popular uprising forced Mubarak from power in February, demonstrators have criticized the country's interim military rulers and called for elections.

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- When Sonia Sotomayor won Senate confirmation to the U.S. Court of Appeals in 1998, all 29 ""no"" votes were cast by Republicans. Sonia Sotomayor is virtually sure to be confirmed by the Democratic-dominated Senate, analysts say. That may happen again when the Senate votes in coming months on Sotomayor's nomination to the U.S. Supreme Court. The career jurist nominated by President Obama would be the first Hispanic justice -- and only the third woman justice -- in the history of the nation's highest court. Those distinctions make Sotomayor's confirmation by the Democratic-majority Senate virtually certain, analysts say. They also note that Republican President George H.W. Bush first nominated Sotomayor as a federal judge, indicating broad political appeal. A senior White House official told CNN that Sotomayor was ""nominated by George [H.W.] Bush -- then Bill Clinton -- [and has] more judicial experience than anyone sitting on the court had at the time they were nominated.""  Watch Obama tell why Sotomayor is 'the kind of justice we need' Â» . The partisan divide over the nomination was immediately evident. iReport.com: Listen to what CNN readers are saying about Sotomayor . Democratic Sen. Patrick Leahy of Vermont, the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, which will first consider Sotomayor's nomination, called her record exemplary for a candidate to succeed retiring Justice David Souter -- a liberal voice on the high court. ""I believe that Judge Sotomayor will be in the mold of Justice Souter, who understands the real-world impact of the court's decisions, rather than the mold of the conservative activists who second-guess Congress, and who through judicial extremism undercut laws meant to protect Americans from discrimination in their jobs, their access to health care and education, and their privacy from an overreaching government,"" Leahy's statement said. ""I believe Judge Sotomayor understands that the courthouse doors must be as open to ordinary Americans as they are to government and big corporations."" Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky called for a vigorous confirmation process to ""thoroughly examine her record to ensure she understands that the role of a jurist in our democracy is to apply the law even-handedly, despite their own feelings or personal or political preferences."" ""Our Democratic colleagues have often remarked that the Senate is not a 'rubber stamp,'"" McConnell said. ""Accordingly, we trust they will ensure there is adequate time to prepare for this nomination, and a full and fair opportunity to question the nominee and debate her qualifications."" Sen. John Cornyn of Texas, a Republican member of the Judiciary Committee, said Sotomayor must ""prove her commitment to impartially deciding cases based on the law, rather than based on her own personal politics, feelings and preferences."" However, CNN Senior Legal Analyst Jeffrey Toobin noted that he hasn't heard any Republicans come out and say they will vote against her, noting that in past nominations, some have come out of the gate outright against the nominees. Still, Sotomayor's critics have begun to highlight comments she made during a panel discussion at Duke University in 2005, where she told students that the federal Court of Appeals is where ""policy is made."" ""I know that this is on tape,"" she then immediately said. ""I should never say that. Because we don't 'make law'... I'm not promoting it, and I'm not advocating it. Having said that, the Court of Appeals is where ... the law is percolating."" CNN senior political analyst Gloria Borger said those comments may be what Republicans rally around in their attempt to block her confirmation. ""I've spoken to a bunch of conservatives today who intend to use this YouTube clip, intend to use lots of clips from speeches she's given talking about how they believe that she will be an activist judge who will legislate from the bench,"" Borger said. ""And so it's kind of interesting because in a way, I think they intend to use more of her speeches and her appearances than lots of her court decisions."" For now, those speeches seem to be the main sticking point, though it is likely Republicans will latch on to other issues they feel make her a bad choice for the job. ""Certainly you will see controversy because it's in Republicans' interest to generate controversy,"" Toobin said. ""They want to defeat her. This is a major, major initiative of the Obama presidency. Now whether any of this controversy sticks, I think, is very much an open question."" Republicans also must be careful about whether unfair scrutiny or personal attacks could backfire, Republican National Committee chairman Michael Steele told CNN when asked about possibly harming his party's Hispanic outreach by opposing Sotomayor. ""You want to be careful,"" Steele said. ""You don't want to be perceived as a bully."" Senate Democrat Dianne Feinstein of California warned against Republican stall tactics in the face of a likely filibuster-proof 60 votes supporting Sotomayor's confirmation. ""Any unnecessary delay will only keep the court from getting ready for a new term and inhibit the Senate's ability to focus on other important priorities like the economy, energy and health care,"" Feinstein said. The National Organization for Woman said Sotomayor ""brings a lifelong commitment to equality, justice and opportunity, as well as the respect of her peers, unassailable integrity, and a keen intellect informed by experience."" However, Wendy E. Long of the conservative Judicial Confirmation Network described Sotomayor as a ""liberal judicial activist of the first order,"" code language for opposition by the political right. The confirmation process will begin with Senate Judiciary Committee hearings, expected in July. The committee will decide whether to send the nomination to the full chamber, which will make the final confirmation decision. Obama has said he wants Sotomayor confirmed before the Senate goes on its August break to ensure that Sotomayor, if confirmed, can be seated with the Supreme Court when it begins its new session in October. Leahy endorsed that timetable, saying Tuesday, ""We are committed to ensuring that the next justice is seated before the court's term begins in October."" Senate Republicans, however, want to allow time for an upcoming Supreme Court decision on an appellate ruling by Sotomayor in an affirmative action case involving New Haven, Connecticut, firefighters. Senate Republican whip John Kyl of Arizona, a member of the Judiciary Committee, noted that the Republican-controlled chamber took 73 days to confirm conservative Chief Justice John Roberts and 93 days to confirm conservative Justice Samuel Alito. To complete the confirmation process by August, the Senate would have to act in 66 days. ""I would expect that Senate Democrats will afford the minority the same courtesy as we move forward with this process,"" Kyl said. In the New Haven case, a three-judge appellate panel that included Sotomayor upheld a lower court ruling that supported the decision of New Haven officials to throw out results of promotional exams that they said left too few minorities qualified. The high court was asked to decide whether there is a continued need for special treatment for minorities, or whether enough progress has been made to make existing laws obsolete, especially in a political atmosphere where an African-American occupies the White House. Long said the New Haven case showed that Sotomayor ""reads racial preferences and quotas into the Constitution, even to the point of dishonoring those who preserve our public safety.""","Republicans say they need time to examine record of Obama's high court nominee .

"Cairo, Egypt (CNN) -- A Muslim Brotherhood candidate for next month's presidential elections here lashed out Monday at the eleventh-hour entrance into the race by Omar Suleiman, the former spy chief to deposed strongman Hosni Mubarak. ""We are not against the concept of anyone running as long as he has the right legal status, but it's unacceptable to have one of the symbols of Mubarak's regime run for president,"" Khairat el-Shater told CNN. ""The majority of Egyptians will not accept him. His candidacy is an insult to the revolution."" The only way Suleiman could win would be by forgery, el-Shater said. ""If there is a 1% chance of forgery in the elections, and he wins that way, then all the Egyptians -- not just the Muslim Brotherhood -- will take to the streets."" Elections are scheduled to start May 23. El-Shater said the brotherhood's political arm, the Freedom and Justice Party, would respect ""all signed treaties,"" including the 1978 Camp David Accords with Israel. ""Regardless of any opinion toward these treaties, they were accepted by decent entities in the country, and it does not mean that changing the political system will affect the treaties."" But he noted that the accords included a component ""about respecting the rights of Palestinians. The Egyptians respected their part of the deal but the Israelis -- until now -- have not respected the Palestinian rights. The Egyptians complied, but the Israelis did not."" El-Shater said the timing of a loan from the International Monetary Fund to the Egyptian government could prove problematic. ""The timing is the problem because we don't think this interim government is performing well, so we object that they take this loan and spend it in two months, then the new government worries about paying it back."" Whatever happens in the election, the top priority for the Muslim Brotherhood and the Freedom and Justice Party is to ease sectarian tensions, which built under Mubarak's regime, he said. ""Mubarak's former regime really oppressed the Coptics and the Muslims because his system was based on tyranny. We aim to rebuild our nation again."" Suleiman entered the race just hours before the Sunday deadline, said Hatem Bjato, who heads the election committee. Suleiman had initially said he would not seek the presidency in the first election for the post since the revolution that led to the toppling of Mubarak. But on Friday, Suleiman did an about-face, saying he felt obliged to supporters. ""I promise you, my brothers and sisters, to complete the goals of the revolution and provide security and stability to the Egyptian people,"" he said in a written statement Friday. Parliament, which is 70% Islamist, passed a bill against Suleiman's running. But it is only symbolic, said Zakaria Abdel Aziz, the former head of the lawyer's association. ""Only a decision from the administrative court would execute such a ban,"" he told CNN. ""Banning former regime members from practicing their political rights for five years or even 10 has been discussed thoroughly, but the law has not been reactivated and there must be proof that Omar Suleiman has been implicated in political corruption before he is banned from running."" The status of another candidate was less certain. A court ruled that liberal opposition leader Ayman Nour will not be allowed to compete because he was jailed in recent years, the candidate's son said Saturday. Nour was recently pardoned and plans to appeal, the son said. That decision could affect the future of al-Shater, since he too was pardoned for his past convictions. A millionaire businessman who served two prison terms under Mubarak, al-Shater is considered a conservative, though he is also credited as being the driving force behind the Brotherhood's affirmation that Egypt should continue to honor its international agreements. Fearful for the future of its candidates, the Muslim Brotherhood nominated Saturday an alternative, Mohammed Morsi, chief of the Freedom and Justice Party. ""We are protecting the revolution and all of its goals. ... We have decided as the Brotherhood and its party to nominate Mohammed Morsi as our backup candidate for president,"" it said in a statement. The group had pledged repeatedly that it would not field a presidential candidate. But candidates from its political arm won the largest share of seats in Egypt's parliamentary elections in December. And Brotherhood leader Mohamed Badie has said the new Egypt ""is under a serious threat"" because its current military-led government ""has failed to represent the will of the people."" A military junta took power after Mubarak's ouster. Salafist candidate Hazem Abu Ismael was also disqualified from running in the election because of his mother's U.S. citizenship, state television reported Saturday. The deceased mother of Abu Ismael held U.S. citizenship and used her U.S. passport to enter Egypt three times, Egypt's Interior Ministry has said. Ismael had said that his mother held a green card residency permit but was not a U.S. citizen. He told a private Egyptian TV program that his sister was married to an American and had obtained U.S. citizenship, but that his mother had not. The official number of candidates is 23.","If Omar Suleiman wins, Egyptians will protest, Khairat el-Shater says .

"London, England (CNN) -- A British aid worker who died during an operation to rescue her from kidnappers in Afghanistan may have been killed by a grenade thrown by American forces trying to free her, British Prime Minister David Cameron said Monday. Gen. David Petraeus, the top U.S. commander in Afghanistan, will launch an investigation into the failed attempt to rescue Linda Norgrove, 36, Cameron said. NATO and British officials had said earlier she was killed by her captors, who detonated an explosive. But Cameron said Monday that statements made about Norgrove's death over the weekend were ""highly likely to have been incorrect,"" although they were made ""in good faith."" Petraeus contacted him Monday morning, he said, with new information. But Cameron said he could not make a firm statement about the cause of her death until the investigation is complete. It will be a joint investigation between the United States and United Kingdom, he said. U.S. President Barack Obama called Cameron on Monday to offer condolences for Norgrove's death, according to a statement from the Downing Street press office. ""The Prime Minister and the President agreed that it was now essential to get to the bottom of what had happened in the course of the rescue operation. They looked forward to close co-operation between the UK and US authorities on the investigation and agreed to stay in close touch as it moved forward,"" it read. The investigation will start in the next day or two and will be led by a senior officer from U.S. Central Command, an International Security Assistance Force official told CNN. One of the key components in determining what went wrong will be the autopsy, which will be carried out by British officials, the ISAF officer said. Cameron and Petraeus are to meet Thursday in London. ""It's a long-standing meeting and has been in the diary for a number of weeks,"" the Downing Street press office said in a separate statement, adding that the discussion will center on the strategy in Afghanistan. Petraeus also will meet with British Defense Secretary Liam Fox to talk about Afghanistan, it said. The initial report on the rescue mission by the troops who carried it out did not mention throwing a grenade, but a follow-up report ""raised a lot of questions about what killed"" Norgrove, U.S. Navy Capt. Gary Kirchner told CNN after Cameron spoke. The mission commander called Petraeus as soon as he learned a grenade had been thrown, Kirchner said, without naming the commander. The investigation will be done ""with all due haste,"" Kirchner said. It will review the mission plan, communications and video from the operation, he said. A ""review of surveillance footage and discussions with members of the rescue team do not conclusively determine the cause of her death,"" the U.S. military said in a statement Monday. The British government aims to share as much of the final report as possible with lawmakers, British Foreign Secretary William Hague said Monday. Cameron said he believed ""profoundly"" that it had been the right decision to try to rescue her, although he looked shaken at times during his statement to reporters. The rescue operation was planned and carried out by U.S. Special Forces, Hague told the House of Commons Monday after Cameron spoke. He personally authorized efforts to rescue her by military action ""within a few hours"" of her being captured, Hague said. He said intelligence and weather conditions played a role in determining the timing of the operation. Norgrove, who had been held hostage since late last month, worked for DAI, an agency that provides various services to developing nations. She spent much of her career managing projects for farmers and rural workers. Cameron said in a statement Saturday that Norgrove ""was doing valuable work for the Afghan people."" Hague said in a written statement Saturday that his forces received information about where she was held and ""decided that, given the danger she was facing, her best chance of safe release was to act on that information. ""Responsibility for this tragic outcome rests squarely with the hostage takers,"" Hague said. ""From the moment they took her, her life was under grave threat. Given who held her, and the danger she was in, we judged that Linda's best chance lay in attempting to rescue her."" Norgrove was being held by two Taliban commanders, Mullah Basir and Mullah Keftan, who were both killed in the raid, an Afghan intelligence official said. An Afghan official said last month that the British woman, two Afghan drivers and a security guard had been kidnapped after an exchange of gunfire September 26 in the Chawkay district of eastern Kunar province. Abdul Marjan Adel, a local provincial official, had said that the four were being held in a ""very remote area,"" and that Afghan and international forces were looking for them. He said they were healthy and located in the Dewcar valley. The three Afghans kidnapped with Norgrove had been released days ago, according to another Afghan intelligence official and a local provincial government official. James Boomgard, DAI president and chief executive officer, called the news of her death ""devastating"" and said his operation is ""saddened beyond words by the death of a wonderful woman whose sole purpose in Afghanistan was to do good."" ""Linda loved Afghanistan and cared deeply for its people, and she was deeply committed to her development mission. She was an inspiration to many of us here at DAI, and she will be deeply missed."" He was speaking before Cameron's statement about the confusion over the cause of her death. After Cameron spoke, Boomgard said: ""Throughout this ordeal, we were satisfied that both the British and American authorities were doing everything in their power to secure Linda's release. ... We have neither the information nor the inclination to second guess the decisions made."" CNN's Adam S. Levine, Barbara Starr, Ivan Watson and Joe Sterling contributed to this report.","U.S. Special Forces planned and carried out the failed rescue operation, official says .

"Cairo (CNN) -- The trial of Egypt's former President Hosni Mubarak will take place behind closed doors, Judge Ahmed Refaat announced Monday, citing ""the public interest"" as he barred television cameras from the court. Judges also combined the case against Mubarak with that of former Interior Minister Habib al-Adly, Refaat said. Both men potentially face the death penalty if found guilty of ordering the killing of protesters in the revolution that toppled them earlier this year. The trial will resume September 5, the judge said, giving officials more time to study evidence. Some prominent Mubarak opponents welcomed the decision not to televise the trial until the announcement of the verdict. ""We need to move on with our lives and concentrate on the upcoming elections ... journalists attending hearings will channel the truth out,"" said Waleed Rashed, a founding member of the anti-Mubarak April 6 movement. Khaled Abu Bakr, a lawyer suing Mubarak in a civil case, said it would help ""maintain objectivity"" to keep cameras out. But many people expressed anger about the decision, including Wael Omar, a founding member of Radio Tahrir. ""They could have done it for the testimonies for legal purposes, but we went a long way to get"" transparency. ""Maybe, they will at least broadcast certain recorded soundbites,"" he said. Small crowds of Mubarak supporters clashed with opponents of the former Egyptian president Monday as he and his sons appeared at the court hearing. The demonstrators threw rocks as security forces between them worked to restore order. Crowds were smaller than during Mubarak's first court appearance last week. Self-described journalist Magde Fouda wore a T-shirt emblazoned with the phrase, ""I am an Egyptian and I reject the humiliation of the nation's leader."" The ""silent majority"" of Egyptians still respect the deposed president, he said. About 840 people died and more than 6,000 were wounded in the 18 days of uprising that toppled Mubarak, bringing an end to his 30-year reign, according to Amnesty International. In addition to accusations of ordering the killing of protesters, Mubarak faces corruption charges. His sons Alaa and Gamal also face corruption charges. All three of them have pleaded not guilty. As during a court appearance earlier this month, the ailing leader was wheeled into court on a hospital gurney Monday. He and his sons watched the proceedings from inside an iron cage -- a standard procedure in Egyptian criminal trials. The former president's reaction to the rulings and noisy deliberations inside the courtroom was not clear. His eyes often appeared closed, while his son Gamal appeared irritated or annoyed, and Alaa was poker-faced. The elder Mubarak was the first leader since this year's Arab Spring revolts to face a judge. Tunisian President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali was tried in absentia after he was deposed in January and fled to Saudi Arabia. On Sunday, a judge postponed the trial of al-Adly, the former interior minister and a member of Mubarak's inner circle. The judge adjourned al-Adly's proceedings after lawyers requested postponement of the hearing until after the Muslim holy month of Ramadan.

"Cairo, Egypt (CNN) -- Egypt's top political parties have agreed to nominate a member of the Muslim Brotherhood as the nation's next parliament speaker, the first time in decades that an Islamist would hold that post. The Brotherhood's Freedom and Justice Party won more than 40% of the seats in recent elections and is expected to lead the country's first parliament chosen since the ouster of former President Hosni Mubarak. The FJP-led alliance nominated its secretary-general, Mohamed al-Katatni, as parliament speaker. Al-Katatni, described as a moderate on the Brotherhood's website, was detained by Mubarak's state security forces together with FJP leaders Essam El-Erian and Mohamed Morsi, the chairman of the FJP. The parliament, which will be seated later this month, must appoint a 100-member panel to write a new Egyptian constitution. Presidential elections are set for June. Liberals fear that electoral gains for Islamists will steer Egypt down a rigid path away from democracy. Morsi tried to reassure Egyptians that the new constitution ""will be drafted without exemption of any stakeholders or exclusion of any parties, forces or currents."" ""We continue the march of the peaceful revolution, the Egyptian revolution of January 25, which has achieved some of its objectives and as yet continues to achieve remaining ones,"" he said. ""There is no doubt that the parliamentary election results were expressive of all Egyptians and their free will, the new parliament, too."" The agreement, signed Monday by six leading political parties, also allows the hardline Al Nour party and the liberal Al Wafd party to nominate two deputy speakers. But Al Wafd was not present at the meeting and did not sign the agreement. ""We were not informed of about the meeting and will announce our decision after our board meeting on Thursday,"" Bahaa Abu Shaka, Al Wafd's deputy chief, told CNN. The new parliament convenes a year after popular revolts erupted, eventually leading to Mubarak's downfall. The longtime dictator is on trial on charges of corruption and ordering the deaths of hundreds of protesters. The Supreme Council of the Armed Forces has led Egypt's government since Mubarak's fall. It has said it will hand over power to a new government once one is in place. But the transition has not been quick or transparent enough for some Egyptians. A series of protests in Cairo last month resulted in violent and sometimes deadly clashes between demonstrators and soldiers. Gen. Mohamed Hussein Tantawi, who heads the Supreme Council, is expected to address the new parliament, according to the Morals Affairs Military Department.","The Muslim Brotherhood's political arm won more than 40% of parliamentary seats .

"London (CNN) -- Rupert Murdoch's media empire suffered a double blow Wednesday as Prime Minister David Cameron launched a wide-ranging investigation into the British press and Murdoch's News Corp. withdrew its bid to take over British satellite broadcaster BSkyB. The moves came in the wake of public and political fury at allegations that journalists working for Murdoch illegally eavesdropped on phone messages of thousands of people and bribed police. Cameron blasted Murdoch's company Wednesday as he launched the high-powered investigation. News Corp. executives need to focus not on taking over BSkyB, ""but on clearing up the mess and getting their house in order,"" Cameron said. He welcomed the withdrawal of the bid, which came hours before lawmakers voted across party lines to pass a symbolic measure urging Murdoch to give up his effort to take full ownership of the broadcaster, in which he already owns a controlling stake. ""It's the right decision (for the company), but also for the country,"" Cameron said. ""Now we've got to get on with the work of the police investigation and the public inquiry that I set up today."" ""It has become clear that it is too difficult to progress in this climate,"" News Corp. Deputy Chairman Chase Carey said in announcing the company would end its attempt to increase its 39.1% share in BSkyB. Opposition leader Ed Miliband of the Labour party -- who pushed the vote against the takeover -- welcomed the News Corp. decision and said it would not have happened had lawmakers not pressured Murdoch. ""The will of politicians was clear, the will of the public was clear, and now Britain's most powerful media owner has had to bend to that will,"" said Miliband, speaking as politicians rowdily debated the measure in the House of Commons. Former Prime Minister Gordon Brown, whose family's private records are alleged to have been obtained by News International newspapers, said it was vital to maintain the right to a free press and the public's right to information. But, he said, staff at News International, a subsidiary of News Corp., took freedom of the press as a license for abuse and then ""cynically manipulated our support of that vital freedom as their justification and then callously used the defense of a free press as the banner under which they marched in step, I say, with members of the criminal underworld."" This ""criminal media nexus"" claimed to be on the side of the law-abiding citizen but was, instead, ""standing side by side with criminals against our citizens."" The criminality was ""not the misconduct of a few rogues or a few freelancers,"" but was carried out ""often on an industrial scale -- at its worst dependent on links with the British criminal underworld."" Brown also defended himself against assertions that his government had done too little to pursue claims of misconduct at News International, saying its relationship with the company was ""neither cozy nor comfortable."" The longstanding role of the press as a force for freedom has been subverted, he said. ""When it has held in contempt not only basic standards of legality but basic standards of decency too; when it has replaced freedom with license; when it has wielded power without ever having been elected to do so; and when it has regarded itself as not only above the law but above the elected institutions of our country, then all concerned people in this House should be able to see that what should be our greatest defense against the abuse of power has itself become an intolerable abuser of power."" John Whittingdale, chairman of Parliament's Culture, Media and Sport Committee, said he did not know whether Rupert Murdoch, his son James and former News of the World editor Rebekah Brooks would testify at a hearing next Tuesday as requested. ""Senior executives"" of Murdoch's British newspaper company ""will cooperate,"" News International has said in a statement, without specifying who. If the Murdochs do not answer the summons, they ""will effectively have said goodbye to Britain,"" Labour lawmaker Chris Bryant told CNN Wednesday. Rupert Murdoch will be ""forever tarred"" by his association with the scandal, Whittingdale said. But he warned against vilifying the press in general. ""It was not just newspapers that were responsible for these clearly unacceptable and often illegal activities; it was also newspapers who exposed them,"" he said. ""A free press is an absolute fundamental cornerstone of a free society and we must not do anything to jeopardize that."" In announcing the public inquiry into press practices and ethics, Cameron said anyone ""found guilty of wrongdoing -- or of allowing it -- must not only be brought to justice, they must also have no future role in the running of a media company in our country."" The judge leading the inquiry will be able to summon witnesses, including newspaper owners, and compel them to testify in public, under oath, Cameron announced. The aim is to ""bring this ugly chapter to a close and ensure that nothing like it ever happens again,"" the prime minister said. Murdoch's company needs ""root and branch change,"" Cameron said in the wake of the accusation that victims of phone hacking included a missing 13-year-old girl, Milly Dowler, who was later found to have been murdered. Cameron met with the girl's family Wednesday. Miliband and Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg met with them separately earlier in the week. The Dowlers are ""delighted"" by the launch of the judge-led investigation and pleased that politicians across the spectrum are working together on the issue, the family's lawyer, Mark Lewis, said after the meeting with Cameron. The investigation will look at whether News Corp.'s British subsidiary, News International, or other newspaper groups broke the law, their relations with the police and politicians and press ethics and practices, Cameron said. Miliband hammered Cameron for having hired a former top News International journalist to be his communications director after the editor left his newspaper, News of the World, in the wake of one of its journalists going to prison over phone hacking. The editor, Andy Coulson, insisted he knew nothing about the crime but resigned from News of the World because it happened on his watch. Coulson resigned as Cameron's spokesman this year when the scandal blew up afresh. Cameron said if Coulson lied about what he knew, he should end up in court. ""If I was lied to, if the police were lied to, if the select committee were lied to, it would be a matter of deep regret and a matter for a criminal prosecution,"" Cameron said. ""But we must make sure that we judge people as innocent until proven guilty."" Condemnation of Murdoch came from many British politicians a day after a senior American senator warned that any Murdoch journalists who illegally eavesdropped on 9/11 victims would face ""severe"" consequences. Sen. Jay Rockefeller, the Democratic chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee, told CNN Wednesday he is considering an investigation into whether News Corp. employees broke the law by hacking U.S. citizens. ""My bet is we'll find some criminal stuff,"" Rockefeller said, speaking a day after he urged U.S. authorities to examine whether U.S. citizens had had their ""privacy violated"" by journalists at the company. Rockefeller and fellow Democratic Sen. Barbara Boxer of California wrote Wednesday to U.S. justice officials and Wall Street watchdog the Securities and Exchange Commission, urging them to investigate possible violations by News Corp. of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. Sen. Frank Lautenberg, a New Jersey Democrat, also called on American authorities Wednesday to investigate whether any News Corp. employees had broken U.S. law by bribing foreign officials. And Rep. Peter T. King, R-N.Y., asked the FBI to investigate whether News Corporation journalists may have tried to obtain phone records of victims of the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. Journalists are accused of attempting to bribe police officers for information -- including personal contact details for members of the royal family -- in addition to the violation of privacy allegations. The News of the World, which was Britain's best-selling newspaper, folded Sunday over other allegations of illegal breach of privacy at the order of James Murdoch. The police officer leading the investigation said Tuesday they had identified 3,870 potential targets of phone-hacking and had notified 170 of them. The officer, Sue Akers, said a team of 45 police were going through 11,000 pages of documents seized from a private investigator working for News of the World. The documents contain some 4,000 cell phone numbers and 5,000 land lines, Cameron said. Murdoch flew Sunday to London, hours after the final edition of News of the World hit the stands. The publication was the first British national paper Murdoch bought, in 1969, as he began to propel himself from Australian newspaper proprietor to international media magnate. News International owns the Sun, The Times and The Sunday Times in Britain. Murdoch's News Corp. also encompasses Fox News, The Wall Street Journal, the New York Post and Harper Collins publishers. CNN's Richard Allen Greene, Laura Smith-Spark, Jim Boulden and David Wilkinson contributed to this report.","NEW: some 4,000 cell phones and 5,000 land lines may have been affected .

"London (CNN) -- British Prime Minister David Cameron will cut short his trip to South Africa to deal with the nation's phone-hacking scandal, his office confirmed Monday -- another day of dizzying developments that also saw a second top police official resign and the announcement of a broader police corruption probe. The day also brought the death of a key figure in the allegations. Former News of the World reporter Sean Hoare, who told the New York Times in 2010 that former newspaper editor Andy Coulson encouraged him and other reporters to hack into the voice-mail accounts of public figures, was found dead, according to the British Press Association. Hertfordshire police confirmed that a man's body was found and ""pronounced dead at the scene shortly after."" The death is ""being treated as unexplained, but not thought to be suspicious,"" the department said in a written statement. Britain is in an uproar over the scandal, which has cast its shadow not just across British journalism, but also Scotland Yard and the prime minister's office. It began with the phone-hacking allegations involving reporters from News of the World -- which led its parent company, Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation, to shut it down -- and quickly broadened into claims that journalists had paid police for confidential information. It has led to the resignations of the commissioner and assistant commissioner of London's Metropolitan Police, known as Scotland Yard, forced the closure of one of the country's best-selling newspapers and resulted in 10 arrests. Among those arrested is Rebekah Brooks, the former News of the World editor and News International executive who resigned after the scandal broke. It also forced the resignation of Coulson, who quit as Cameron's communications director in January as the scandal began to heat up. Coulson was News of the World editor when one of the newspaper's reporters and a private investigator were sent to prison after pleading guilty to phone hacking in 2007. ""I don't think anybody anticipated that it would snowball in this fairly dramatic way,"" said Jef McAllister, a London-based lawyer and former bureau chief for Time Magazine. Cameron said Monday that he'll request a special session of Parliament on Wednesday to address the scandal, even flying back early from South Africa. ""I think it may well be right to have Parliament meet on Wednesday so I can make a further statement, update the House on the final parts of this judicial inquiry and answer any further questions,"" he said. Cameron was referring to a broader corruption probe announced in Parliament on Monday by Home Secretary Theresa May amid allegations that police accepted payments from journalists in exchange for confidential information. May said she would ask Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary to examine ""instances of undue influence, inappropriate contractual relationships and other abuses of power."" The inspectorate is a division of the Home Office that inspects and reviews police forces in Britain to ensure they operate according to standards. The allegations are part of a widening scandal that began with revelations that journalists working for the News of the World newspaper had eavesdropped on the phone of a missing girl, Milly Dowler, and deleted some of her messages to make room for more. She was later found dead. Already, Metropolitan Police Commissioner Paul Stephenson has resigned on Sunday and the assistant commissioner, John Yates, on Monday after being caught up in the scandal. Yates ruled two years ago that there was no reason to pursue an investigation into phone hacking by journalists. He has since called his decision ""crap."" He was due to be suspended when he quit, the Metropolitan Police Authority said. He denied Monday he had done anything wrong, saying in a prepared statement that he feared the scandal and allegations against him would be a distraction as London prepares to host the 2012 summer Olympics. ""I have acted with complete integrity and my conscience is clear,"" he said. Stephenson quit after revelations a former News of the World executive editor, Neil Wallis, was hired as a communications consultant for the police. ""I carry ultimate responsibility for the position we find ourselves in,"" Stephenson told reporters. ""With hindsight, I wish we had judged some matters involved in this affair differently. I didn't and that's it."" Stephenson stressed Sunday that he had behaved ethically, but decided to resign because increased scrutiny may burden his department and detract from its accomplishments. He also denied Wallis, who was arrested in the probe, was involved in phone hacking when he was brought on as a consultant. Such denials, though, didn't halt the Independent Police Complaints Commission from announcing Monday that Yates and Stephenson are among four current or former senior London police officials it has been asked to investigate. The complaints against Yates include his role in failing to pursue a 2009 investigation into allegations of phone hacking, as well as claims he was inappropriately involved in getting a job for a friend's daughter, the commission said. The commission said it will look into Stephenson's overall role in the initial investigation into phone hacking, as well as that of two other unnamed officers. May told Parliament that, in addition to the inspectorate's inquiry, she also will consider additional resources and powers for the Independent Police Complaints Commission. She also has asked Elizabeth Filkin, former parliamentary commissioner for standards, to evaluate ethical considerations that should guide police relationships with the media. The management board of the Metropolitan Police has already agreed to new standards regarding its officers' relations with media, including recording meetings between police and reporters and publishing information on the Internet, May said. ""Mr. Speaker, there is nothing more important than the public's trust in the police to do their work without fear or favor,"" she said. Parliament is set to meet Tuesday, when hearings scheduled on the scandal. Brooks is due to appear alongside Murdoch and his son James, a News Corporation executive. Earlier Monday, a spokesman for Brooks said the former editor's Sunday arrest by police would not interfere with her plans to testify. She was released on bail until October, police and her spokesman, David Wilson, said. Brooks' lawyer, Steven Parkinson, said Monday she is not guilty of any crime. He warned that police need to consider the damage they had inflicted on her reputation after arresting her and questioning her for nine hours, but not putting any charges or documents before her. Her husband got swept up in the scandal Monday, with the allegation he'd been trying to discard evidence after investigators found a bag in a trash bin near the couple's house. Brooks' spokesman, David Wilson, told CNN the bag had been brought there by a friend of Brooks' husband, Charlie Brooks, before being tossed by a cleaner or security guard. Wilson said he and three others in the apartment building were looking for the bag when police arrived, hoping to collect it. The spokesman insisted that authorities would discover quickly that the material inside the bag is irrelevant to the investigation and ""has nothing to do with Rebekah."" Brooks, who resigned Friday as chief executive of News International, is one of 10 people arrested in connection with the phone-hacking probe and the fourth arrested in the bribery investigation, according to police. Police said Monday that they will take no further action against one of the people who was arrested, a 34-year-old woman. British press reports identified her as Laura Elston of the Press Association, who is thought to be the only person not working for Murdoch who has been arrested in the probe. News Corporation itself got hacked late Monday, when the hacker group LulzSec claimed credit for targeting The Sun, one of the British papers under the conglomerate's media umbrella. It redirected those on the paper's website to a false story claiming Murdoch had been found dead in his garden. Soon after that link was taken down, those going to the Sun's website were redirected to LulzSec's Twitter page. The hacks that have gotten investigators' attention are alleged to have been done by News Corporation employees. Police in the United Kingdom have identified almost 4,000 potential targets of phone hacking in documents recovered from a private investigator working for News of the World. The FBI is also investigating News Corporation after a report that employees or associates may have tried to hack into phone conversations and voice mail of September 11 survivors, victims and their families. An FBI spokesperson added Monday the investigative agency was ""aware of the media reports"" that actor Jude Law was hacked in the United States and that News Corporation had settled several lawsuits with American businesses, but said there would be no official comment ""since these matters are under review."" Murdoch's News Corp. encompasses Fox News, The Wall Street Journal, the New York Post, and Harper Collins publishers in the United States. News International -- a British subsidiary of News Corp. -- owns the Sun, The Times and The Sunday Times in Britain.

"New York (CNN) -- A New Jersey rabbi beat and kidnapped an Israeli man and threatened to bury him alive unless he agreed to a divorce and his family paid off his ex-wife, federal prosecutors say. David Wax and his wife Judy, surrendered to FBI agents in Red Bank, New Jersey, on Monday to face kidnapping charges dating back to an incident in October, according to the U.S. attorney's office in Trenton. ""The victim was shown a body bag and told that if he did not comply, he would be buried alive in the Pocono Mountains,"" according to an FBI agent's affidavit released Monday. ""A dark-colored body bag was brought into the room and laid on the victim by Wax, who stated, 'For you to get used to the size.' "" David Wax is also charged with calling the man's father in Israel and demanding $100,000 for the ex-wife -- asking him, according to court papers, ""Do you want a funeral or a divorce?"" A lawyer for the rabbi said federal prosecutors have taken over the case from state authorities, who dropped previous charges. But ""whatever the form, state or federal, Rabbi Wax is not guilty of these charges,"" the attorney, Mitchell Ansell, told CNN. ""He has eight children, no prior criminal record and [is] a pillar of his community,"" Ansell said in a statement Tuesday morning. ""We are confident that when the facts are made public, he will be cleared of these charges and his good name and reputation restored."" Neither the divorced couple nor their relatives were named in the charges. The couple are still involved in a contested divorce, including child custody issues, in a religious court in Israel, and the husband has refused to consent to the dissolution of their marriage, court papers state. According to the charges, the man had been working with Wax, a rabbi in Lakewood, New Jersey, and showed up to a late-night meeting at the Wax home in mid-October. When he arrived, Wax brought him to an upstairs bedroom, where two unidentified men jumped from behind, beat, bound and blindfolded him, the affidavit states. Wax also took part in the beating, according to the paperwork. During the beating, the man agreed to give his wife the divorce. But the pummeling continued for several hours, the papers state -- and one of the attackers told him that the assault was the man's ex-wife's ""revenge"" for his delaying the proceedings. Afterward, according to the affidavit, Wax and the victim got into a taxi, then into a car driven by Judy Wax. She took them to the man's cousin's house in Brooklyn, where they let him go early the following morning, the charges state. Investigators who came to the Waxes' home two days later found the carpet in the room where the man said the beating had taken place had been changed the same day, according to the affidavit. The FBI affidavit states David Wax's cell phone records and video from an automatic teller machine support the victim's account. There were five calls between David Wax's cell phone and a number in Israel ""associated with"" the ex-wife and her family, according to the affidavit. In addition, the affidavit states the ex-wife had arrived at Newark Liberty International Airport from Tel Aviv the day before the incident and flew back via New York's John F. Kennedy airport the day after her ex-husband was turned loose. CNN's Chris Boyette contributed to this report.","NEW: A lawyer for the rabbi says his client will be cleared .

"(CNN) -- Investigators said Thursday they found the fungus Exserohilum in one medicine lot from the compounding pharmacy at the center of a meningitis outbreak that has killed 21 people, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration announced. The presence of Exserohilum was found in ""unopened medication vials,"" which were tested at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, according to the FDA. The discovery links the fungus to the Massachusetts-based New England Compounding Center, the FDA said. What is a compounding pharmacy? The CDC said Exserohilum had been found in 45 patients. The fungus can be difficult to find, meaning a patient with a negative test is still not in the clear. Symptoms from Exserohilum also can take a long time to develop. The CDC updated Friday the number of people known to have contracted noncontagious fungal meningitis from steroid injections. The number of cases has grown to 271. Three of the cases are a ""peripheral joint infection"" that specifically affects a joint such as a knee, hip, shoulder or elbow, officials said. Sixteen states have been affected, including New York, which was added to the CDC's list Thursday. Meningitis is an inflammation of the protective membranes covering the brain and spinal cord. It is usually caused by an infection, frequently with bacteria or a virus, but it can also be caused by less common pathogens, such as fungi in this case, according to the CDC.

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- A bizarre three-and-a-half minute North Korean propaganda video -- depicting a city resembling New York but with its skyscrapers on fire -- was pulled from YouTube this week after videogame maker Activision said those scenes were lifted from its top-selling game ""Call of Duty."" Clicking on the now-defunct YouTube link brings up the message: ""This video has been removed by the user. Sorry about that."" But the video can still be found elsewhere on the internet. The anti-U.S. video also employs an instrumental version of ""We Are the World,"" written by Michael Jackson and Lionel Richie, while a sleeping North Korean man apparently dreams himself aboard a North Korean space shuttle launched into orbit around the Earth. Just after the video's two-minute mark, a city covered by a large American flag is seen apparently being bombarded by a missile attack. The Korean-language caption that scrolls across the screen says, ""Black smoke was billowing somewhere in America. Maybe the group of Satan, who has been habitually conducting an invasion war, are burning in the fire they set themselves."" The release of this video, the latest in a series of regular propaganda videos, comes as experts and officials widely believe North Korea is on the verge of its third nuclear test, following trials in 2006 and 2009.

"BERLIN, Germany (CNN) -- As voting was taking place in the German general election Sunday, attention was already turning to what coalition will rule the country. Social Democrats handing out flowers hope their party will stay in the ruling coalition. Few doubt that Angela Merkel's Christian Democratic Union, CDU, will win most votes. So, will Merkel continue the current center right-center left ""grand coalition"" with the Social Democrats or will the votes suffice for a coalition with the business liberal but centrist Liberal Democrats or the FDP, a constellation Germans refer to as ""Black-Yellow."" At a press conference ostensibly to outline Germany's position at this week's G-20 summit Merkel apparently let the cat out of the bag. ""We are in a time of crisis,"" she said, ""and I believe we can pull out of the crisis faster with a Black-Yellow government."" But some political analysts believe she would prefer to keep the Social Democrats as the junior coalition partner. Polls indicate the CDU and FDP could gain a razor thin majority to form a governing coalition. Recent polls put their combined tally at around 48 percent. That is not exactly a large majority, but it's two percent more than the left of center parties, the Social Democrats, the Green Party, and the left wing ""Die Linke,"" who would reach about 46 percent if polls are accurate. The Liberal Democrats have been in opposition since 1998 and at a rally in Berlin, their leader Guido Westerwelle was sure his time has come. ""I think the voters won't allow a coalition of the left to be in power. I think they want a conservative government and they will vote to put us in power,"" he said. Westerwelle is eyeing the post of foreign minister under a future Merkel government.  What's at stake in the German election Â» . A government of CDU and FDP, conservatives and liberal would probably be more business friendly than the current grand coalition. Both the CDU and FDP want to cut taxes to further jumpstart Europe's largest economy which emerged from its deepest recession only a few months ago. But even optimistic economists believe cutting taxes will be all but impossible for a government which will inherit the largest public deficit in German history after the current government was forced to ruin in its public finances to bail out banks and industrial companies in the wake of the international financial crisis. And it appears more trouble lies ahead. ""After the economic crisis we will see a social crisis,"" says Henrik Enderlein an economics professor at the Hertie School of Governance in Berlin. Enderlein believes a coalition with the liberals would put Merkel under pressure to implement wider ranging tax breaks than she feels are sustainable. That is why some believe Merkel would not mind continuing her coalition with the Social Democrats who oppose tax cuts and call them irresponsible in a time of disastrous public deficits. The Social Democratic contender running against Merkel, Frank Walter Steinmeier, however, has all but given up any hopes of winning. ""We want to prevent a ""black--yellow"" coalition,"" he keeps repeating at rallies. Confidence sounds different. Polls currently have the Social Democrats at around 26 percent of the vote, a disastrous figure for a party that in 1998 gained more than 40 percent. But the Social Democrat ranks were decimated in the seven years they ruled the country under Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder. Many traditional left wing SPD voters felt Schroeder betrayed the powerful labor wing of the party by cutting social benefits while making it easier for companies to fire employees in times of crisis. The SPD was further hit when many loyal members splintered off and joined the left wing party die Linke which also incorporates remnants of the former communist party that rules East Germany. Now Steinmeier is trying to lead the Social Democrats out of the impasse and he realizes his real chance to stay in power would be as the junior partner to Merkel. Steinmeier would keep his post as foreign minister and many political experts in Berlin think this might be what both Merkel and Steinmeier are really striving for. ""They worked very well together,"" said Gero Neugebauer of the Freie Universitat Berlin. ""The atmosphere was very good and that is very important for such a coalition."" For Germans it seems like the two choices are realistic: A coalition of CDU and FDP, or a grand coalition of CDU and SPD, like the one that is currently governing the country. Those options haven't exactly fired up the election campaigns. Both Merkel and Steinmeier were loath to attacking each other and both of them cancelled several scheduled TV appearances which would have seen them go head to head. ""This election seems kind of lame,"" one young summed it up when I asked him near Berlin's technical university. International experts have a similar opinion. One issue they feel has gotten short shrift was the war in Afghanistan. Germans have the third largest troop contingent in the country with about 4,200 soldiers stationed in the north. But Afghanistan played only a minor role in the election campaigns and in their only televised debate, Merkel and Steinmeier devoted less than three minutes to the issue, less than a week after a German ground commander had called an air strike that killed almost 100 Afghans and possibly also civilians. ""It is simply not high on the political agenda,"" says Jan Techau of the German Council on Foreign Relations., ""Most Germans are against the war in Afghanistan and having German troops there, but they don't care about it enough for it to influence the way they vote."" So Merkel and Steinmeier were careful to keep Afghanistan off the campaign agenda as best they could because they agree German troops need to stay in Afghanistan like they agree on so many topics. That did not make for an exciting campaign, but it could make for a good continuation of the grand coalition.","Angela Merkel's CDU are favorites to win the election .
But they will need a coalition partner to rule .
Merkel has publicly named the Liberal Democrats as her preferred choice .
But the current partner, the Social Democrats, may be the end result ."
"Paris, France (CNN) -- Hurling insults against French President Nicolas Sarkozy, crowds of demonstrators marched through the boulevards of eastern Paris to protest his anti-crime measures. Organized by 50 human rights and activist groups, labor unions and political opponents of Sarkozy the cortege of protesters at one point stretched a mile and a half from the Place de La Republique to the Place de la Bastille, where a stained French flag was hung on a central monument. Organizers said 50,000 filled the streets, though police put the official estimate at 12,000. Referring to France's contentious role in World War II, protesters held up signs such as ""Sarkozy, son of Petain,"" referring to Marshal Philippe Petain, who led the pro-Nazi Vichy regime. Organizers said about 130 cities in France are seeing similar protests against Sarkozy's so-called crime-busting proposals which have led to the expulsion of more than 8,000 Roma, commonly known as Gypsies. Saturday's protests erupted after the recent raids against camps in Lyon and other cities that forced out a total of 8,300 Romanian and Bulgarian nationals of Roma origin. Close to 10,000 were expelled in 2009. Roma are a group of people who live mainly in southern and eastern Europe, often in poverty. They tend to live in camps, caravans, or informal settlements and have been the target of persecution throughout history. But the Roma are not the sole targets of the recent anti-immigration security measures proposed by the French government, protesters claim. Groups representing other causes voiced their concerns at the Paris rally as well, including advocates of illegal immigrants and demonstrators demanding better housing. After recent anti-police attacks, the country's parliament is considering new laws to take away French citizenship from naturalized immigrants guilty of crimes like attacks on police, polygamy or female circumcision, traditions associated with some immigrant groups. Some believe Sarkozy's approach of blaming immigrants for security problems flies in the face of France's democratic fundamentals -- liberty, equality and fraternity. ""He is not fighting crime ... He is deliberately putting into question the basic principles of republican equality, and what is already an extremely serious social and economic crisis now threatens the cohesion of all society,"" organizations supporting the protests said in a statement posted on the Education Without Borders Network's website Saturday. When he announced the proposals in July, Sarkozy said French citizenship was a privilege. ""One must earn French nationality and be worthy of it,"" he said. ""Anyone who fires on an agent enforcing order no longer deserves to be French."" Immigration policy has long been a top issue for the conservative Sarkozy. As interior minister, he advocated the deportation of foreign nationals caught in violent riots across France in 2005. But the recent crackdowns have drawn criticism even within Sarkozy's government. Local media reported that Foreign Minister Bernard Kouchner said he was shocked by the president's anti-crime proposals. Last month's ousting of Roma gypsies without valid identity papers -- drew international criticism with some comparing it to the deportation of Jews during World War II. Something the government said was absurd since those being expelled were being sent back to their homelands with financial compensation of 300 euros ($381) per adult and 100 euros ($127) per . child, Frances immigration ministry said. French officials have said the deportations are part of a broader crackdown on illegal immigration. In his July speech, Sarkozy said France needs better immigration regulations. ""We are suffering from the consequences of 50 years of inadequately controlled immigration that led to a failure of integration,"" he said. ""We are so proud of our system of integration, but perhaps we should wake up to see what it has produced. It has worked. It works no longer."" CNN's Catherine E. Shoichet contributed to this report.","Protesters say measures are discriminatory and will not stop crime .

"(CNN) -- A 61-year-old man was sentenced Monday to 15 years in federal prison for helping engineer a $14.2 million Medicare fraud, including hiring parishioners at the church he co-lead to help with the scheme, the federal government said. Christopher Iruke was convicted in August -- along with his wife, Connie Ikpoh, and one of their employees, Aura Marroquin -- of conspiracy and health care fraud. Besides the prison time, U.S. District Judge Terry Hatter on Monday ordered Iruke to pay back $6.7 million with his conspirators and serve three years of ""supervised release"" once he gets out of prison, the U.S. Justice Department said in a news release. He and Ikpoh were charged in October 2009 with bilking Medicare by fraudulently billing the government for electric wheelchairs and other expensive medical equipment. At the time, the two were both pastors at a now-defunct Los Angeles church, the Arms of Grace Christian Church. Ikpoh also worked as a nurse at Southern California hospitals. They ran one of their fraudulent companies, Pascon Medical Supply, from the church. Another -- Horizon Medical Equipment -- was owned by Ikpoh. At last year's trial, jurors heard evidence that Iruke bought fraudulent prescriptions and documents that the three used to bill Medicare for equipment that were either ""medically unnecessary or never provided,"" the Justice Department said. For instance, they billed Medicare about $6,000 for a power wheelchair that actually costs closer to $900. Under threat of an audit by Medicare, Iruke persuaded his sister and one of his parishioners to open two new medical supply firms in their names. These were run after the other two companies, Pascon and Horizon, ceased operations. During the trial, witnesses said that ""they and others paid cash kickbacks to street-level marketers to offer Medicare beneficiaries free (devices and equipment) in exchange for the beneficiaries' Medicare card numbers and personal information."" This data was used to make fraudulent prescriptions and medical documents, which they then sold to Iruke and others. Iruke told two of his employees, including Marroquin, to lie to state and federal inspectors and also urged them to talk on cell phones in hopes of evading law enforcement, witnesses said at the trial. In total, the federal government said that the conspirators submitted $14.2 million in fraudulent Medicare claims and got about $6.7 million in reimbursements. Marroquin was sentenced in December to time served and three years of supervised release, while Ikpoh will be sentenced February 27.","Christopher Iruke, 61, was the pastor at a now-defunct L.A. church .

"Bamako, Mali (CNN) -- A rapid deployment of an international military force is essential to solving Mali's security crisis, regional and international leaders said after a meeting Friday in the nation's capital. ""Mali needs a political transition through transparent elections within 12 months, functioning institutions and an immediate deployment of international troops,"" said Daniel Kablan, chairman of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS). U.N. Deputy Secretary-General Jan Eliasson said his organization is ready to provide immediate support to aid national dialogue and assist in political negotiations. ""We will immediately bring military planners and security sector advisers"" to Bamako, the Malian capital, the secretary said. ECOWAS can provide military training, logistics and reinforcement of Mali's own forces, Kablan said. Leaders from the European Union, United Nations and Western African states met as al Qaeda-linked rebels tighten their grip in the north of the country. Malians for and against military intervention have protested on the streets of the capital in recent days, highlighting a divide in citizens' opinion. Last week, the U.N. Security Council approved a resolution that gives regional leaders 45 days to provide detailed plans for an international military intervention. Friday's meeting was a follow-up to the resolution. ""Beyond this sad situation, there is the serious threat that the entrenchment of terrorist and criminal network poses to Mali, the region and beyond. This is a threat we cannot afford to take lightly, and the danger extends far beyond Africa. The sooner we deal with it, the better,"" said Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma, chief of the African Union Commission. Mali was plunged into chaos in March after a military ruler overthrew the president, shaking one of West Africa's most stable democracies. The coup leader stepped down in May and transferred power to a civilian transitional government. However, uncertainty looms as Islamist militants roaming the north wage a campaign of destruction. Soon after the coup, ethnic Tuareg rebels and Islamist militants took advantage of the power vacuum to seize the northern part of the country. Two groups with ties to al Qaeda later toppled the Tuareg movement, and now control two-thirds of northern Mali, an area the size of France. ""The crisis is Malian, but the development affects the neighboring countries, our partners. And we need international help to fight the Islamists, to organize free and fair elections, and to help restore our country,"" interim Malian President Dioncounda Traore said. West African leaders and the transitional government have asked the United Nations Security Council to authorize military intervention to oust the rebels. The resolution approved last week tasked U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon with working with African leaders to submit to the Security Council within 45 days ""detailed and actionable recommendations"" in preparation for the deployment of an international military force in Mali. As leaders work to find a solution, grim reports of human rights violations are emerging in the north. Radical Islamists are compiling a list of unmarried mothers, raising fears of cruel punishments such as stoning, amputations and executions, a senior United Nations official said this month. The list will include women who have had children out of wedlock and those who are unmarried and pregnant, according to Ivan Simonovic, the U.N. assistant secretary-general for human rights. The Islamists have vowed to impose a stricter form of Islamic law, or Sharia. They say the law condemns relations outside marriage. Extremists have conducted public executions, amputations, floggings and other punishments. In addition to human rights violations, Islamists razed tombs near the desert city of Timbuktu on Thursday -- the latest attacks targeting cultural heritage sites in the north. The rebels have destroyed tombs and shrines in the city, which features various ancient and prominent burial sites. They regard such shrines as idolatrous and thus prohibited by their religion. Sufi shrines, which they consider sacrilegious, have been subjected to the most attacks. Sufism is a mystical dimension of Islam considered offbeat by Islamic hardliners.

"(CNN) -- The lessons of the first round of the French presidential elections are multiple and somewhat contradictory. There is, on the one hand, the first-round victory of a self-described ""normal man"" who is still -- in spite of very tight results -- likely to become the next president of France: FranÃ§ois Hollande. His lack of charisma has not been a handicap, so great was the rejection of incumbent President Nicolas Sarkozy. FranÃ§ois Hollande's good-naturedness and his smiling personality evoke a mixture of Jacques Chirac and even Georges Pompidou. One should not be deluded: Any successful politician has a killer instinct. But his friendliness is reassuring after the hyper-energetic and aggressive personality of Sarkozy, whose style was making people unnecessarily anxious. Hollande has managed to turn the first round into a referendum against the personality and style of the incumbent. One might say Sarkozy's behavior greatly encouraged him in this choice of strategy. The incumbent candidate would have done better campaigning on his success in dealing with an unprecedented economic crisis with determination and firmness. In 2007, Sarkozy campaigned on hope and modernity. In 2012, he was the candidate of fear, appealing to the right-wing opponents of immigration. It wasn't expected at all, but French participation was at a level that Americans dream about: more than 80%. But this apparent triumph of democracy was somewhat tainted. Nearly 20% of the electorate voted for the National Front, the party of the extreme right. To add insult to injury, many young voters supported the party's candidate, Marine Le Pen. Youth is supposed to be synonymous with hope. With the rise of unemployment and the decline of belief in the value of the European Union, it seems young people, especially poorly educated ones, are motivated by fear much more than by hope. This rise of right-wing populism affecting mostly the young, which one witnesses from Hungary to France, is of course the direct consequence of the economic, social -- if not ethical -- crisis that besets Europe once again. It would be excessive to speak of the return of the 1930s. Those tragic years were the product of the encounter between the Great War of 1914-18 and the Great Depression of the late 1920s and early 1930s. We are not there and, we hope, will never again be there. Nevertheless, in France, Sarkozy has been playing with fire in his attempt to seduce extreme-right voices. As Churchill would have said: ""He will have dishonour first and then defeat."" At this point, only a miracle could save Sarkozy. In 2007, modernity meant the call for structural reforms. In 2012, modernity may be on Hollande's side when he campaigns on fairness and the fight against social injustice. In this juncture in our global world, there is a need to restore a broken social contract resulting from too much inequality. It is a most modern issue that concerns the entire world, with the possible exception of Nordic Europe. It affects the United States as well as China, India or Brazil. Sacrifices can only be acceptable if they seem to be equally shared by all segments of society. What would a Hollande victory mean for France and for Europe? The year 2012 is not 1981, when the Left came to power behind FranÃ§ois Mitterrand for the first time in the history of the Fifth Republic. The Cold War is over; the Reds are more ""pale pink"" than ever; the rules of monetary union are much stricter than they ever were. The margin for maneuver in a sovereign state in Europe is extremely limited by law as much as by economic circumstances. Hollande is a Social Democrat; he does not have the means to be a revolutionary. As for Europe, Hollande in power in France would merely be an accelerating factor in the slow evolution of the EU away from a strict austerity policy, which the Germans themselves have started to question. Can a ""normal man"" be the right choice for exceptional times? Harry Truman in the United States rose to the challenge. Why not Hollande in France? The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Dominique Moisi.","Dominique Moisi: The French dislike Sarkozy, and Hollande is sure to win the presidency .

"Athens (CNN) -- Tens of thousands of people rallied across Greece Thursday to protest further tough austerity measures, as a general strike essentially shut down much of the country's transportation network. Clashes broke out in Athens after protesters threw stones and bottles at police and chanted slogans saying they had no place policing a peaceful demonstration. The rallies come as European leaders gather in Brussels, Belgium, for a summit where they will work on building closer ties between eurozone countries. The move is seen as critical to converting recent progress on fixing the region's debt crisis into a sustainable path to growth. Greek Prime Minister Antonis Samaras is expected to argue there for more time for Greece to implement the cuts demanded by Europe in return for the latest installment of bailout funds the country desperately needs. EU leaders talk fiscal union as Greeks protest austerity . The harsh austerity measures already in place have angered many people in Greece, which is in its fifth year of recession and has seen its unemployment rate soar to more than 25%. Thursday's general strike is the second in a month called by unions who say another round of cuts to wages and pensions are too painful for the Greek people to bear. Anger over the austerity measures have led to violent street demonstrations in the past. About 30,000 people took part in demonstrations in Athens Thursday, police spokesman Panagiotis Papapetropoulos said. The violence, which was fairly limited, lasted about 90 minutes. The protesters had largely dispersed from the city's central Syntagma Square by mid-afternoon. A 65-year-old man died after fainting during the rally, an official with the PAME union said. ""The union's doctors tried to revive the man but this was not possible,"" Giorgos Pondikos said. ""He was taken to hospital where his death was confirmed. The incident is not related to any violence."" Rallies were also staged in mainland cities including Thessaloniki and Patras, as well as on the Greek island of Crete. ""We are here to protest the cuts 'they' are making, the misery they are imposing on the people,"" said a PAME union member protesting in Athens. ""I am here to ensure that the measures won't go through and because I feel Greek people should have a say on what is being done,"" a fellow demonstrator said. Read more: Protestors rally as Merkel voices support for austerity-hit Greece . ""There is no other way. The only way is for the working class to understand that we must change things. That what is happening is a result of a flawed system. And we must make sure that it stops to exist."" Some demonstrators waved the flags of Spain and Portugal, alongside those of Greece, in an apparent display of solidarity with other nations laboring under tough austerity programs. Shops were closed Thursday as a result of the strike, while hospitals operated on skeleton staffing and the transport system was badly affected. Greece's coalition government is struggling to nail down all of the Ã¢âÂ¬11 billion of spending cuts it needs to satisfy the conditions of its bailout. Athens is also reportedly at odds with the International Monetary Fund over the outlook for the economy and the likelihood it will achieve its deficit reduction targets. Samaras is pushing for a two-year extension of the nation's bailout program, which the previous government agreed to in March. In a show of support, German Chancellor Angela Merkel met earlier this month with Samaras in Athens, suggesting that Berlin is softening its stance on Greece. The so-called troika of the European Commission, the European Central Bank and the IMF are due to report on Greece's troubled economy in the coming weeks, with the release of the next tranche of bailout money dependent on its findings. Barroso: Europe federation 'unavoidable' The troika said Wednesday at the end of a visit to Greece that agreement had been reached on ""most of the core measures needed to restore the momentum of reform and pave the way for the completion of the review."" Its representatives and Greek authorities ""had comprehensive and productive discussions on the policies needed to restore growth, employment and competitiveness, secure fiscal sustainability in a socially balanced manner, and strengthen the financial system,"" the statement said. In Brussels, Europe's leaders will discuss an interim report outlining steps to strengthen the eurozone, including proposed reforms of the banking sector and more integrated budget policies, according to a letter from European Council president Herman Van Rompuy. Greece's long-running economic woes have shaken global markets and led to fears the country could crash out of the 17-member eurozone single currency if it defaults on its debt. The turmoil in the eurozone has exacerbated concerns about other ailing nations such as Spain and Italy, which are also struggling with high unemployment and debt.

"(CNN) -- When Clifton Green and his wife adopted an adorable little girl from Ethiopia, they knew they would eventually have to deal with the hair issue. Clifton Green learned how to care for his daughter Miriam's hair, which is very different from his own. The Atlanta, Georgia-based couple, who are white, had read books about transracial adoptions that addressed how to deal with Miriam's springy curls that grew in full, dark and strong after a toddlerhood of baldness. Green took it upon himself to learn how to care for and style his daughter's textured tresses. ""We didn't have any skills, but we had the desire,"" said Green of learning to do his now 5-year-old daughter's hair. ""It's the culture, it's important and we want to honor it and respect it."" For many African-Americans, having a child walk around with unkempt hair is an almost unpardonable sin. That desire to be well groomed extends into adulthood and the multitudes of hairstyles are as diverse as the black community itself. There are naturals, weaves, chemically relaxed styles, braids and dreadlocks, to name just a few. Far from being superficial, black hair and its care goes well beyond the multibillion-dollar industry it has become and is deeply rooted in African-American identity and culture. ""Barbershops and beauty salons are perhaps second only to black churches as institutions in the community,"" said Ingrid Banks, an associate professor of Black Studies at University of California, Santa Barbara and author of a forthcoming book on contemporary black beauty salon culture.  iReporters share their hair-stories Â» . ""It's not about hair per se, it's about what hair means, particularly for black women in terms of racial identity, identity based on gender and ideas about power,"" she said. ""On one level, hair matters because race matters in our society. For black people, our hair has been infused with these racial politics."" Banks points to the ideas, which continue to linger, that if a black woman straightens her hair she is ""selling out the race"" and/or ""embracing the white standard of beauty"" while women who wear their hair in natural styles are ""blacker than thou."" ""When we think about that, there is no other racial or ethnic group in which those ideas come to bear on someone's politics,"" said Banks, who gathered data for her book by traveling to black hair salons across the country. ""No one is saying that about white women, Asian women or Latino women."" Erin Aubry Kaplan, who wrote an article about Michelle Obama's hair and its implications for Salon.com, believes the first lady's straightened and perfectly coiffed style helps her image. ""She has been criticized about many things, but I think that underneath the criticism about her being radical or too outspoken about race is this uneasiness people have about her being this tall, dark-skinned woman,"" Kaplan said. ""So her hair is important, because if she is tall, dark-skinned and has an Afro then she becomes really scary."" Sound off: Is there such a thing as 'good hair?' That unease was also evident in 2008 when The New Yorker magazine ran a cover with a drawing portraying Michelle Obama wearing an Angela Davis-style Afro while fist bumping her turban wearing husband. ""[The cover] I think was meant to poke fun at what people really fear,"" said Kaplan, who added that as a black woman who does not have kinky hair, she has had her own share of issues. ""I understood the intent, but we aren't at the point where we can laugh at black images, because every black image resonates and reflects on black people as a whole."" Robert Morris can relate to the perceptions that black hair can evoke. The CNN iReporter recently cut the dreadlocks he had been growing for years and said that along with the physical makeover came an attitude shift in how people responded to him. Check out Morris' iReport on his change . ""I wasn't as approachable when I had the locks,"" said Morris, who now sports a shorter, cropped do that he is enjoying. ""It seemed like I had the stigma of being 'the angry black man.' "" People's possible reactions to hair caused another iReporter to lose sleep. Tamille Johnson said her decision to get kinky twists kept her up the night before her visit to the salon. Read Johnson's concerns in her iReport . ""It was really surprising to me because I was so afraid what people would think about them and I didn't think I would feel that way,"" Johnson said. ""Whenever I would get my hair done, I would get straight styles and I did not know if people would think that the kinky style was pretty."" Johnson, an administrator at UC Berkeley, said she found the experience to be soul searching and she came to terms with the fact that as long as she thought her hair was beautiful, that was all that mattered. That attitude is one Renae Valdez-Simeon hopes to impart to her two daughters. Because her children are biracial, Valdez-Simeon said she has often heard comments about her children's ""good hair."" Go to Valdez-Simeon's iReport . ""When a child has straight hair, they are told they have 'good hair' and while people aren't telling children with curly hair that they have 'bad hair,' in essence that is what you are saying because you are saying that straight hair is good hair,"" Valdez-Simeon said. Valdez-Simeon, whose site Mixtkids.com is billed as ""One Mom's journey to raise empowered mixed-race children,"" said she has increasingly heard the comments because her 7-year-old sports tight, curly ringlets while her 1-year-old's hair has yet to curl.   ""I try to explain to people that good hair is not straight hair, it's healthy hair,"" said Valdez-Simeon, who also said all of the comments have come from African-Americans. Comedian Chris Rock saw the same attitudes in his young daughters and it helped motivate his new documentary ""Good Hair."" The film is narrated by Rock and explores black hair from a variety of angles, including the booming $9 billion generated by the black hair industry and the science behind chemical relaxers used to straighten hair. Rock also visited the Bronner Bros. International Hair Show in Atlanta, a twice-a-year event that has been in existence since the company started in 1947. Janet Wallace, hair show manager, said as many as 50,000 attendees have come annually to each of the events to see the latest trends, services and products available. Stylists and the public alike are enthralled by the art form that is hairstyling, Wallace said. ""People want to look good from the cradle to the grave,"" Wallace said. ""Hair is fun because there are so many adornments and things you can do with it."" Green acknowledges that he has not reached that level of artistry yet, but takes pride in styling his daughter's hair well. On weekends, the Emory University professor can be found wielding the various combs, brushes and products he has found that work for Miriam's hair (Carol's Daughter is a favorite at the moment). While he said he's still not that good with ""rows,"" the cornrow style that braids the hair close to the scalp, he can work other braided styles, twists and an occasional French braid. The ritual of doing Miriam's hair is not only a time of bonding for the pair, but also an opportunity for him to honor his daughter and her heritage. Green has kept his sense of humor about the many people who express surprise that he is so well educated about and skilled with black hair. ""I don't want people to look at her and tell she has white parents,"" he said, laughing.","Hairstyles tied to black culture and identity .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- French President Nicolas Sarkozy's collapse while jogging and subsequent hospitalization prompted speculation and concern Monday in France over the 54-year-old's state of health. French President Nicolas Sarkozy shakes hands with medical staff as he leaves hospital Monday. Though the hospital which treated Sarkozy said tests had detected nothing abnormal, officials said the president's fainting had been caused by a nerve condition called vasovagal syncope. What is syncope? Syncope (pronounced ""sin-ko-pea"") is the brief loss of consciousness or fainting caused by a temporary decrease in blood flow to the brain. It is a common condition that affects as many as half of all people at least once in their life. Three percent of people develop it more frequently. Syncope may be associated with a sudden fall in blood pressure, a decrease in heart rate or changes in blood volume or distribution. What causes syncope? According to some experts, syncope is often the result of an underlying medical condition that could be related to the heart, nervous system or blood flow to the brain. It is also associated with anxiety, fear, pain or hunger and often happens when a person goes from a sitting position to a standing one. There are several types of syncope. The most common one is vasovagal syncope, which occurs when the blood pressure drops suddenly, reducing blood flow to the brain. When a person stands up, gravity causes blood to settle in the lower part of the body. In most people, the heart and nervous system will react and give out the correct signals to maintain blood flowing everywhere else in the body. But in some cases, the system does not send out the right signals, leading to a lack of blood flowing to the brain. What happens when the condition strikes? Symptoms include dizziness, nausea, sweating, falling and, ultimately, fainting. After ""blacking out,"" the person usually regains consciousness within minutes, but may experience a period of confusion or feeling weak for up to 24 hours. In 2002, former U.S. President George W. Bush had a fall at the White House after he choked on a pretzel. The pretzel stuck in his throat and caused the vagus nerve to send a signal to his heart. This slowed it down and reduced blood flow so much he passed out. How is syncope treated? Depending on the underlying cause of syncope, treatment is aimed at preventing a syncope recurrence. Treatment may include medication; wearing garments to improve circulation; changing one's diet; taking precautions when changing positions from sitting to standing and in rare cases, implanting a pacemaker. With appropriate treatment, syncope can be resolved in most patients.

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Anti-American sentiment in Arab nations may be at a historic high, but Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice was the honorary recipient of more than a quarter of a million dollars in jewelry from an Arab leader over the past year. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice received gifts of jewelry, but federal law mandates they go to archives. Saudi Arabia topped the State Department's annual inventory of gifts to top administration officials. In July King Abdullah presented Rice with a ruby and diamond necklace with matching earrings, bracelet and ring worth $165,000. Earlier in the year, in January, the Saudi king presented Rice a $147,000 emerald and diamond necklace, bracelet and earrings set. The State Department originally reported that the emerald and diamond jewelry set came from Jordan's King Abdullah, but the Jordanian government pointed out such a gift was never made by the Jordanian king. ""No such gift was given to Secretary Rice from HM King Abdullah II,"" the Jordanian Embassy in Washington said in a statement. ""We believe this must have been a mistake on the part of the State Department. Gifts by HM King Abdullah II to U.S. officials are always symbolic and of little material value."" The State Department acknowledged and apologized for the error. ""Our records indicate that the King of Jordan did not give Secretary of State Rice the emerald and diamond and jewelry set (ring, bracelet, necklace and earrings),"" said Noel Clay, a State Department spokesman. ""She received this jewelry set from the King of Saudi Arabia,"" he said. ""We regret this error and will correct and resubmit the federal register. The United States counts both Saudi Arabia and Jordan among its most important partners."" The gift list, prepared by the State Department's Office of Protocol, itemizes all presents to top administration officials. The recipients do not keep them, as they are turned over to government archives in accordance with federal law, which prohibits officials from accepting personal gifts. President George W. Bush and first lady Laura Bush also were remembered by their Arab friends. The Saudi king gave the first lady an $85,000 sapphire and diamond jewelry set and a $10,000 piece of artwork made of gold, depicting a desert scene of Bedouins, camels and a tent. The first couple also received embroidered pillows with the names and pictures of the first dogs, Barney and Ms. Beazley. The pillows were given to Laura Bush by the wife of former Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. The gifts range from the extravagant -- like the jewelry -- to the modest -- a $6 assortment of nuts and dried fruit given by the Dalai Lama to Laura Bush -- to the downright odd, like the Abs Exerciser given to President Bush by the prime minister of Singapore. Many of the gifts are related to the recipient's post. Defense Secretary Robert Gates received an Arab knife valued at $3,200 from the Bahraini government. Despite Russia's tensions with the United States over Georgia, U.S. Gen. Peter Pace, the former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, received a machine gun from his Russian counterpart. The source of gifts to U.S. intelligence officials is classified, but CIA chief Michael Hayden raked in $8,000 in gifts, including a gold cow plaque, a silk rug and a strand of pearls.","NEW: State Department incorrectly said Jordan's King Abdullah gave Rice jewelry .

Use the end of a rattail comb to draw a line from the hairline at the outer corner of one eyebrow diagonally back to the center of the crown. It creates a sultry swoop in front while maintaining balance on both sides. 3. Condition First . For silky strands, apply a treatment mask to dry hair for 10 minutes before you shampoo. This allows natural oils to penetrate the cuticle and soften it from within. After rinsing, lather your scalp with a gentle shampoo to remove dirt and residue. 4. Be a Brunette Bombshell . A rich cocoa hue ""has a dramatic quality that you just don't get from lighter shades,"" says N.Y.C. colorist Jason Backe, who likes Clairol Perfect 10 at-home color kit in Medium Auburn ($14; at drugstores). For BeyoncÃ©'s golden brown, try L'OrÃ©al Paris FÃ©ria in Sparkling Amber ($10; lorealparis.com). 5. Ulterior Movements . According to body language expert Patti Wood, tossing hair back while showing the palm of your hand ""is mysterious and sexy."" But avoid twirling hair -- it signals insecurity. 6. All the Right Moves . There's a reason wind machines are a photo-shoot staple: Hair that's tousled is more provocative than stiff, straight planks. So fake the breezy effects of a blower with swinging layers. If you have medium to thick hair, ask your stylist for choppy layers all the way around your head (like Jennifer Aniston's). If you have fine strands, all it takes is a few chin-grazing pieces in front. 7. Spice Things Up . ... with a sexy floral oriental fragrance (our pick: Armani's new frangipani, licorice and patchouli blend). Spritz the nape of your neck, and with every flirty toss your hair will release the come-hither scent. 8. Indulge Fantasies . No, we're not pushing Princess Leia's braids and bikini! But next time you reach for a ponytail holder, think sexy secretary. Twist hair into a low chignon, then secure it with a pencil, chopstick or, our fave multitasker, Clarins' smoldering black liner pencil with a tapered, tuckable end. 9. Dare to Gleam . There's a fine line between glossy and greasy, but new featherweight silicone sprays make it an easy one to navigate. For touchable shine, mist spray on palms and run them over the hair. Try: Sebastian Professional Trilliant shine spray, $20; sebastianprofessional.com for salons. 10. Go Untucked . Experts agree that the surest way to fizzle your sizzle is by pushing hair behind your ears. ""It's juvenile and generally not flattering on anyone,"" says N.Y.C. hair pro Garren. ""Pull your hair back if you're at work, but on dates you can let it fall in your face in that flirty, Kate Moss kind of way,"" says Harry Josh. Get a FREE TRIAL issue of InStyle - CLICK HERE!

"(EW.com) -- Has Bieber Fever broken? Justin Bieber swept the top categories at the 40th Annual American Music Awards on Sunday night, winning three of the night's biggest categories. But ratings were down sharply from last year. The AMAs telecast delivered 9.5 million viewers and a 3.4 rating on ABC, falling 21 percent from 2011 to an all-time low. In a way, this performance goes against the ratings trend. In recent years, broadcast scripted shows have been on a downward slope thanks to cable and DVRs, but awards programs have been seemingly immune. The working theory is that the more urgency you can create around a telecast, the better the numbers. So sporting events, competition reality shows and award shows have often out-performed other types of programming because viewers want to enjoy the immediacy of the event and not get spoiled by headlines revealing the outcome the next day. Obviously, last night, not so much. EW Daily Poll: 'SNL's 'The Californians' sketch is... ABC points out the telecast was up against tough competition from NBC's Sunday Night Football and some NFL overrun on CBS, though sports and music award show audiences don't typically have a ton of overlap.

"(CNN) -- Two Indian soldiers died in a firefight with Pakistani army troops in the disputed Kashmir region, the Indian army said Tuesday, amid heightened tensions in the region following a deadly clash two days ago. India said a group of Pakistani troops had crossed the Line of Control, the de facto border between India and Pakistan in the region, and entered the Indian-controlled side of the Himalayan territory. Read more: Fire destroys historic shrine, triggering anger in Kashmir . According to the Indian military, the Pakistani troops had taken advantage of thick fog in a wooded area to intrude into the Mendhar sector of Poonch district, but were spotted by a routine Indian patrol. After a firefight lasting about 30 minutes the Pakistani troops retreated to their side of the Line of Control, the Indian military said, leaving two Indian soldiers dead. ""This is yet another grave provocation by Pakistan Army which is being taken up sternly through official channels,"" a military statement said. Gen. Asim Bajwa, a spokesman for the Pakistani military, told CNN: ""We totally deny this baseless allegation."" Col. Rajesh Kalia, a spokesman for the Indian Army's northern command, told CNN: ""We have lost two army soldiers in this incident and one of the bodies has been badly mutilated."" Kalia said the Indian military had not heard of any Pakistani casualties in the firefight. Tensions flared over the weekend when a Pakistani soldier was killed in a clash between the two sides, according to the Pakistani military. There were differing accounts of Sunday's incident. According to the Pakistani military, Indian troops crossed the Line of Control and attacked a military post. Pakistani army troops repulsed the attack, but one Pakistani soldier was killed and another critically injured, the military said. The Indian Defense Ministry, however, said Pakistani troops opened fire unprovoked on Indian posts in the north Uri sector of Indian-administered Kashmir. Indian troops retaliated and forced Pakistani troops to stop firing, the ministry said. It did not immediately report the number of casualties. A statement Tuesday from the Pakistani military said: ""Pakistan military officials deny (the) Indian allegation of unprovoked firing. It looks like Indian propaganda to divert the attention of the world from Sunday's raid on a Pakistani post by Indian troops, in which a Pakistani soldier was killed."" The territory under dispute lies in India's Kashmir Valley, separated from Pakistan by the 450-mile Line of Control. Read more: South Asian rivals take baby steps to warmer relations . The two South Asian nuclear neighbors have had a cease-fire along the de facto border since November 2003. But the cease-fire has been violated repeatedly, with both sides accusing the other of offenses. Bilateral talks were suspended in 2008 after an attack by Pakistani militants in Mumbai, India's most populous city. The negotiations resumed last year. The conflict dates back to 1947, after Britain relinquished control of the Indian subcontinent, giving birth to modern India and Pakistan. Kashmir was free to accede to either nation. Maharaja Hari Singh, the ruler of the kingdom at the time, initially chose to remain independent but eventually opted to join India, thereby handing key powers to the central government in New Delhi. In exchange, India guaranteed him military protection and vowed to hold a popular vote on the issue. Read more: 2 police officers killed in Kashmir attacks . The South Asian rivals have fought two full-scale wars over the territorial issue. Islamabad has always said that majority-Muslim Kashmir should have been a part of Pakistan. A United Nations resolution adopted after the first war called for a referendum allowing the people of Kashmir to choose which country they wanted to join, but that vote for self-determination has never been held. Pakistan wants that referendum to take place. India says that Pakistan lends support to separatist groups fighting against government control and argues that a 1972 agreement mandates a resolution to the Kashmir dispute through bilateral talks.

"Washington (CNN) -- The Supreme Court ruled for drug manufacturers Tuesday, deciding that a case brought by a Pennsylvania family who says their child was injured by a vaccine cannot be heard outside of a court created to hear such claims. The Bruesewitz family engaged in what they called a ""fight for justice,"" claiming that a combined disease-prevention booster shot left their then-infant daughter with severe physical injuries.  But the justices, by a 6-2 vote, concluded that drug makers cannot be sued outside a special judicial forum set up by Congress in 1986 to address specific claims over safety. The so-called ""vaccine court,"" which has handled such disputes, was designed to ensure a reliable, steady supply of vaccines by reducing the threat of expensive lawsuits against pharmaceutical firms. It was clear the high court struggled over precisely how the federal statute should be interpreted, and Justice Antonin Scalia, writing for the court, said congressional ambiguity in the law played a part in their conclusions. ""The lack of guidance for design defects [in the drugs] combined with the extensive guidance for the grounds of liability specifically mentioned in the act strongly suggests that design defects were not mentioned because they are not a basis for liability,"" he wrote. At issue was whether such liability claims can proceed in separate state courts, if the vaccine-related injuries could have been ""avoided"" by better product design and if federal officials had approved another, allegedly safer drug. ""Taxing vaccine manufacturers' product to fund the compensation program,while leaving their liability for design defects virtually unaltered, would be an odd way to make vaccine manufacture more effective,"" said Scalia. The lawsuit was brought by the parents of Hannah Bruesewitz, a young woman from the Philadelphia area.  They claimed she was in fine health as an infant in 1992 when given a series of DPT shots -- a combination of vaccines to prevent diphtheria, pertussis (whooping cough) and tetanus. After the third series, according to court briefs, the child began having seizures and became disabled. Hannah, who turns 19 next week, continues to suffer what is described as ""residual seizure disorder,"" and will require lifelong care. The Bruesewitzes alleged Wyeth Laboratories failed to adequately warn them and other parents of the risks associated with the vaccine. Court records show the vaccine lot in question produced 65 reports of adverse reactions, including 39 emergency-room visits. The family alleges another vaccine owned by Wyeth -- known as Tri-Solgen -- had proven in earlier tests to result in fewer potential side effects. The Bruesewitzes claim the company and the federal Food and Drug Administration were lax in pushing use of the alternative, potentially safer vaccine. The original drug given to Hannah was discontinued by Wyeth in 1998. The ""vaccine court"" rejected the initial claim, so the family tried to revive the lawsuit in separate state and federal courts. Their lawyers claimed Congress did not intend to block all vaccine-related lawsuits, especially those filed when the harmful side effects were avoidable. Four firms supply vaccines for the U.S. market -- Wyeth, GlaxoSmithKline PLC, Merck & Co. and Sanofi-Aventis SA. Justice Sonia Sotomayor dissented in the case, joined by Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. ""Manufacturers, given the lack of robust competition in the vaccine market, will often have little or no incentive to improve the designs of vaccines that are already generating significant profit margins,"" wrote Sotomayor. ""Nothing in the text, structure, or legislative history remotely suggests that Congress intended that result."" A federal appeals court eventually ruled for Wyeth, now owned by Pfizer Inc., concluding all design-defect claims were barred under the statute. Despite that victory, the company urged the high court to hear the case, saying it seeks final resolution on the broader legal questions. The Obama administration under then-Solicitor General Elena Kagan also urged review and is supporting the company and the federal law in question. Kagan, now a Supreme Court justice, sat out of the case to avoid a conflict of interest in the eventual ruling. Wyeth and other drug manufacturers say their products are generally safe, but side effects can occur in very rare cases. They also say the vaccine industry is generally not profitable, but the health benefits for society in general have kept them in the business. For that, they say, legal protection provided by Congress is essential to ensure such drugs are widely available and . affordable. Doctors' groups applauded the high court ruling. ""Childhood vaccines are among the greatest medical breakthroughs of the last century,"" said Dr. O. Marion Burton, president of the American Academy of Pediatrics, which represents 60,000 physicians. ""Today's Supreme Court decision protects children by strengthening our national immunization system and ensuring that vaccines will continue to prevent the spread of infectious diseases in this country."" The high court has yet to act on a related pending appeal. The Georgia Supreme Court in 2009 became the first appeals court in the United States to allow families to sue outside the special vaccine court. That case involved Atlanta-area parents who claimed their son, Stefan Ferrari, suffered severe neurological damage 12 years ago from booster shots by Wyeth and GlaxoSmithKline that contained the mercury-based preservative thimerosal. Now 14, the boy is unable to speak, say his parents, Stefano and Carolyn Ferrari. The preservative has since been taken out of nearly all standard vaccines. Despite winning at the state level, the family has since withdrawn its case, but the liability on drug companies resulting from that decision remains in force in Georgia. The National Childhood Vaccine Injury Compensation Act was passed to establish a nationwide strategy to ensure a secure vaccine supply, promote safety and future research, and compensate innocent victims. Those goals were listed at the time as a ""top public health priority."" Lawmakers at the time recognized the vaccine supply was suffering under rising company costs from potential liability claims. Despite FDA approval for the vaccines, pharmaceutical firms claimed they were being driven out of the market. The special federal court created under the legislation was a liability shield, designed to be a reliable, relatively quick, no-fault solution to various claims. Unresolved over the years is whether and when certain exceptions to liability should be in play in specific cases. The current high court case is Bruesewitz v. Wyeth (09-152). The pending case is American Home Products Corp. v. Ferrari (08-1120).","The Supreme Court decides in favor of drug manufacturers .

"(CNN) -- Facebook is adding new security features, which come after a pair of high-profile cracks in the site's defenses that surfaced this week. One new mechanism is called ""social authentication."" To combat spam and prevent strangers from weaseling into your account, the system will sometimes show the user a friend's headshot and ask to match a name to that face. This multiple-choice photo quiz is a new take on a common Web system called Captcha. The older method displays a picture of some squiggly letters and asks you to type those on the keyboard. It's used for verifying that a site's user is a person and not a computer program looking to exploit systems. Facebook reduced spam from partners' applications by 95% last year, Bret Taylor, the company's technology chief, said at a conference this week. The social networking giant currently employs Captcha technology, but this new method could supplant that. Adding this human touch could not only combat robot intruders but also weirdos who try to thumb through your account after you forget to log out of the library computer. ""The vast majority of people who have used Facebook have never experienced a security problem,"" Alex Rice, a Facebook security engineer, wrote on the company blog. ""However, if we detect suspicious activity on your account, like if you logged in from California in the morning and then from Australia a few hours later, we may ask you to verify your identity so we can be sure your account hasn't been compromised."" Facebook also started rolling out the option to securely browse the social networking site using a secure connection. Like the technology used by banking and some e-mail services like Gmail and Hotmail, this defense encrypts all information to and from Facebook so that it's much harder for someone to eavesdrop on the Wi-Fi line. ""With a little motivation and not much skill, it's fairly trivial to sniff HTTP traffic,"" Alan Ross, the lead security analyst for Intel IT, told CNN in November. ""Maybe I want to see all Web traffic for Facebook because I want to see what the interesting person across the cafe is updating on Facebook."" Soon, Facebook account holders concerned about hackers can turn on the ""secure browsing"" option in their settings panel. Two Facebook users in particular should be advised to opt in to the feature. Mark Zuckerberg, the company's CEO, and French President Nicolas Sarkozy were both victims of intruders on their Facebook pages this week.","Facebook adds a security feature that asks you to identify friends in pictures .

"Des Moines, Iowa (CNN) -- Sarah Palin's speech to an Iowa tea party rally on Saturday will come on the three-year anniversary of her memorable address to the Republican National Convention in 2008, when she became GOP vice presidential nominee and an instant conservative darling. Much has changed since then. After the GOP ticket went down in defeat, Palin returned to Alaska and shocked Republicans by leaving the governor's mansion the following summer. After a period in the wilderness (at times literally), she re-emerged and transformed herself into a curious amalgam of tea party firebrand, global celebrity, Facebook prognosticator, reality television star and, of course, potential presidential contender. Now in the final stages of deciding on whether to embark on that White House bid, Palin plans to use her Iowa speech to revisit the themes of that convention address that made her a star. Palin will also deliver a sharp indictment of President Barack Obama and accuse him on failing to change the way Washington works, a source familiar with the speech said. ""What she is going to address in this speech is the frustration that members of the tea party movement and ordinary Americans feel when they send politicians to Washington and nothing gets changed,"" the source said. ""There is a frustration that the status quo is always the status quo."" The source said Palin is attempting to burnish her image as an outsider and a reformer, reminding the audience of her record in Alaska and specifically highlighting her battles against what she called the state's corrupt Republican political class that was in cahoots with the oil and gas industry. Palin plans to unleash a furious criticism of ""crony capitalism"" and attack the ""permanent political class"" in both parties: thinly veiled criticisms of Texas Gov. Rick Perry, who has surged to the top of most polls for the Republican presidential nomination. Political opponents have long accused Perry, who has held some form of elected office since 1985, of rewarding his allies and campaign donors with plum government posts and contracts. Though she has no plans to mention Perry or any other Republican presidential hopeful by name, Palin will implicitly contrast herself against the current crop of GOP candidates and further define her brand in case she does decide to run. Palin, who has said she plans to make a decision about the race by late September, will not announce a presidential bid Saturday. The speech almost didn't happen. Palin had initially accepted an invitation to speak at the Restoring America event in Indianola, which generated national buzz when it was announced last month. Palin supporters from across the country are traveling to the state by plane and bus for the speech, and the governor is likely to speak to them in Des Moines on Friday evening at a meet-up organized by the online hub Conservatives4Palin. But members of Palin's staff indicated this week that her appearance at Saturday's rally was being put on hold because of ""planning issues"" and concerns that the group behind the event, Tea Party of America, was being ""dishonest"" about the speaking program. A Palin adviser said Wednesday that event organizers had been sending them mixed messages about the event, including the question of whether Christine O'Donnell, whom Palin endorsed in her run for the U.S. Senate in Delaware in 2010, would participate. O'Donnell was removed from the speaking program at the request of the Palin team, one of the rally's organizers, Ken Crow, told the Des Moines Register. The Palin source said O'Donnell's representatives had misled the tea party group about the extent of the governor's relationship with O'Donnell. O'Donnell's representatives told event organizers that she would be in Iowa on the date of the rally and would like to come by and ""say hi"" to Palin, the source said. O'Donnell was then added to the speaking agenda. The source said O'Donnell aides lied to organizers and said Palin had been communicating via text message with O'Donnell about the rally. ""The governor hasn't spoken to her in a year,"" the Palin source said of O'Donnell.","Former Alaska governor will speak on third anniversary of convention speech .

"(CNN) -- Every morning Kong Kit Tam goes on a 7 a.m. walk around his neighborhood - not for exercise, but for money. Tam is a paper scavenger. His currency is waste paper. For the past three years, he has dug into dirty garbage cans to pull out old newsprint and has shuffled through dimly-lit back alleys to haul out used cardboard boxes. An empty carton of Marlboro cigarettes, a torn envelope for an electricity bill and a pink pastry box get stuffed into his shoulder bag today. He sells it all to a recycler for money. ""Each month I might earn $100 or $200 or $300 Hong Kong dollars,"" Tam says. That's $12 to $36 U.S. dollars and is his only source of income. The short, rumpled 50-year old talks through a slight smile but his circumstances are no joke. ""I never thought that I would be doing this,"" Tam admits. ""I do it to survive, it's my livelihood."" Tam's life stands in stark contrast to a Hong Kong more famous for its iconic skyline and glitzy high life as an Asian hub for global financial firms. A Hong Kong government report released last month revealed that the city's wealth gap is the widest in the developed world. Tam is a prime example of that other extreme. And he is not the only one. ""There are an estimated 10,000 people who are recycling scavengers in Hong Kong,"" says Sze Lai Shan, a well-known local rights activist and social worker for Hong Kong's Society for Community Organization, or SOCO. But paper scavengers like Tam are making much less money today than last year. The reason is thousands of miles away, says Jacky Lau, president of one of Hong Kong's oldest recycling companies. ""Europe is facing many economic problems and this has translated to fewer manufacturing orders for clothes and toys in China,"" explains Lau. ""Fewer orders mean a slowing demand for paper boxes, so prices have fallen dramatically."" Standing among bales of crushed plastic bottles and piles of books waiting to be recycled, Lau says that one kilogram of waste paper would have gotten about 18 cents this time last year. Today, that value has been halved. Adam Minter, who runs the China-based blog Shanghai Scrap, says the recycling industry as a whole is one of the first to experience a slowdown in the event of a global economic slump. ""The street prices [for scrap metal] are down along the east coast of China -- down 50% from highs of about 6 months ago. They're very sensitive to demand for raw materials."" And the paper industry can be even more delicate. ""Paper might be the most consumer sensitive of all because it's used in packaging - and packaging is used for everything,"" said Minter, who has just finished writing a book about the globalization of the waste and recycling industry. And Hong Kong waste recovery companies are feeling the pinch because 98% of Hong Kong's recovered paper goes to be recycled in China, says Lau. He adds several of the city's 400 firms have already closed down. And he's not optimistic the economy will make a comeback this year. ""July is when prices should start to pick up. Retailers in Europe and the U.S. should be placing their Christmas orders right now but business has remained relatively quiet. The second half of this year is looking rather grim."" Lau said he earned up to $400,000 last year. This year, he expects to just break even. As for Tam, his hope is just a dollar a day. Like Lau, he is equally uncertain about the future. Back at his tiny 9th story walk-up, entirely subsidized by the government, Tam stashes his paper trash in a corner under a table until he makes his weekly trek to the recycler. The money he makes mostly goes to food for himself, his disabled 32-year old wife and his 10-year old daughter. Tam, who moved to Hong Kong from Guangdong province three years ago, explains that is the only thing he can do for money. He never went to high school and only did four years of elementary school -- two years at each level because of his mental disability. ""I'm not sure about next year. Prices might rise or fall. It's like buying shares, you never know whether they are going to rise or fall."" And so Tam's only hedge is to keep scavenging for even more paper, shuffling along the city's streets and hoping that prices rise again. CNN's Anjali Tsui and Jethro Mullen contributed to this report .","10,000 of Hong Kong's poor depend on collecting scrap paper .

"(CNN) -- Vice Presidential debates are usually treated as bores or curios. The best you can hope for is a misstep that makes the headlines the next day -- think Dan Quayle comparing himself to Jack Kennedy or Bob Dole lambasting all those ""Democrat wars."" But the debaters are auditioning to be understudy, so they usually play it safe. Record numbers tuned in to watch Biden vs. Palin in 2008 simply to see if Sarah Palin would go 90 minutes without humiliating herself or her running mate. Apart from some aggressive winking, she performed adequately and disaster was avoided. So two personalities who ought to have made for great TV were actually a little dull. Thursday night's debate will be different, because it matters in a way that previous matchups have not. Mitt Romney's performance in last week's debate seems to have shaken up the polls. That's not just because he did well, but also because the voters appear to be more undecided about the election than we thought they were (just look at the massive attitude shift that Pew reports among female voters). In such an environment, gaffes and good rhetoric count for a great deal. Recall that the debates proved just as important to deciding the Republican primaries, and one of the reasons why Romney won the primaries is that he was so good at the debates. With the country now evenly divided between the two nominees, the race could end up being settled by a few hours of televised sparring. Hence, Biden vs. Ryan is worth tuning in to. Martin: Biden must deliver for Team Obama . It also helps that these two men embody the differences between the two parties. Both are Catholics, but from contrasting traditions. Biden comes from the Vatican II generation for whom Catholic piety is centered on social justice and economic fairness. For him, government welfare programs are an extension of Christian charity -- and he's happy to embrace the cultural changes that have altered attitudes about contraception, women and gay rights. 7 questions you would ask at the VP debate . By contrast, Ryan is part of the John Paul II generation of conservative Catholics who have often despaired of the American church's flirtation with liberalism. Ryan has a moral theology that sees government as sapping self-reliance, and abortion as the murder of the unborn. Between the two of them, we have the bifurcation of the Roman Catholic Church personalized: social conscience vs. natural law. That said, it's interesting to note that Ryan has been prepping for this debate with Ted Olson -- the man who provided legal assistance to pro-same-sex marriage campaigners. It's surprising that no movement conservatives have made a fuss about the company that Ryan keeps. In this contest between Catholics, who stands the better chance of winning? Paul Ryan, and for three reasons. First, Ryan is younger. In last week's debate, despite being the older man, Romney came across as more youthful and energetic than the president. He looked not only ready to lead, but also more willing. Likewise, Ryan is a handsome, athletic young man who hunts deer with a bow and arrow. Already the star of an internet ""Hey Girl"" meme, he will reinforce the impression that the GOP ticket is the more virile. CNN Exclusive: How Paul Ryan sharpens debate skills . Second, Biden is a more erratic performer than Ryan and so more likely to make a blunder. A good drinking game to play during the debate would be to take a shot every time Biden says ""literally,"" another if he mispronounces someone's name, and another if he forgets Paul Ryan's. His tendency toward hyperbole and emotionally charged gaffes is notorious. The flip side of that problem is that if he keeps his natural energy too much in check, then he won't seem like the same old Biden that Democrats know and love. In 2008, he was outperformed by Sarah Palin partly because he seemed to be playing the statesman. As a rule, Biden does better in front of loud, sympathetic audiences (see his barnstorming convention speech). Third, the issue momentum is with Romney/Ryan. It's true that Friday's jobs report lowered the unemployment rate and brought some good news to the administration. But it doesn't seem to be reflected in the polls yet. That might be because many Americans don't feel like things are getting better -- because so many are quitting the labor market or getting part-time work. Add to that some of the negative reports about the administration's handling of the Middle East and you get the sense that this week belongs to the Republicans. Opinion: Five ways Obama can bounce back . Whoever wins, what is reassuring for fans of politics is the importance that debate has played in this election. With millions of dollars spent on negative ads and the Internet awash with silly stories about dogs on cars and old speeches, it's nice to know that uninterrupted, rational debate spread over just 90 minutes can still make such an impact in contemporary American democracy. Biden vs. Ryan is far from Lincoln vs. Douglas, but the spirit lives on. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Timothy Stanley.","With the race close, Thursday's VP debate matters in a new way, says Timothy Stanley .
Biden and Ryan embody the differences between the two parties, Stanley says .
Being younger and less erratic than Biden gives Ryan an edge, he says .

"(CNN) -- Years before Bill Nye became the Science Guy, he was a mechanical engineering student at Cornell University, where he took a course with astronomer Carl Sagan.

It's quite odd,"" a surprised-sounding Nye told CNN in an interview in March at the TED2012 conference in Long Beach, California. So today, the bow-tied, jauntily professorial Nye has a new role aside from his television work as a popularizer of science: As the society's chief executive, he's become a leading voice against the Obama administration's proposed $300 million cut in NASA's planetary exploration budget. And it's a subject about which he's passionate. Remembering retired NASA astronaut, Alan Poindexter. ""This is a deep, deep concern. All the budgets are being cut. We gotcha, budgets are being cut, budgets are being pulled back, yes, yes, all good,"" he says, acknowledging the pressure to cut spending. ""But investment in space stimulates society, it stimulates it economically, it stimulates it intellectually, and it gives us all passion. Everyone, red state, blue state, everyone supports space exploration. So I understand the budget has got to be cut, but something has gone a little bit wrong."" Nye says the planetary exploration budget, facing a reduction of 21% from this fiscal year's budget, is taking a deeper cut than other parts of NASA. ""This wouldn't matter. except it's not a faucet. It's not a spigot you can turn off and on. You stop planetary exploration, those people who do that extraordinary work are going to have to go do something else."" His worry is that the U.S. is in danger of losing its unmatched scientific expertise to plan and execute missions to other planets. ""To try to really land a spacecraft really on another world is really difficult, and if we lose that ability, it's going to be heartbreaking,"" says Nye, who adds that it could take decades to recoup. Nye makes another argument for investing in exploring the solar system. He says there are two kinds of natural disasters that can be prevented: One is climate change, and the other is the Earth getting hit by an asteroid. Telescope aims to head off asteroids' impact on Earth . ""If the Earth gets hit by an asteroid, it's game over. It's control-alt-delete for civilization."" Nye says he figures ""sea jellies, squid, cockroaches will be fine,"" but an asteroid could wipe out humankind. ""So what we want to do is to develop the capability to redirect, to deflect an asteroid, ever so slightly. If you're going to do that, you've got to have space exploration. And sooner or later, you're going to want to send people out there to look around. It's just our nature, and one day it would be exciting to send people to Mars."" NASA is in the midst of active exploration of Mars. In August, Curiosity, the Mars Science Laboratory rover, is due to land on the planet's surface. David Weaver, NASA's associate administrator for communications, says the rover is the ""Hubble of Mars missions"" and ""the most sophisticated scientific system ever sent to another planet."" Space junk diplomacy . Its mission is to determine whether the red planet could have ever hosted life. Weaver said in June that the agency is reformulating its Mars strategy in light of budget constraints and scientific priorities and ""the president's challenge of sending humans to Mars in the 2030s."" Nye says his concern isn't about current missions but about whether the next series of missions and the ones beyond that will have enough funds to proceed. Taking a larger view, Nye says there are two questions everyone should ask themselves at some time in their lives: ""Where did we come from? And are we alone?"" ""To seek the real answers to those questions, you have to explore space, and if you stop exploring, if you say, 'I don't care; I'm not going to look up and out and beyond the horizon,' what does that say about you? It's not good,"" Nye said. ""If we found life on Mars, or evidence of life on Mars, it would change the way everybody thinks about everything. It would change the way you think about your place in space.""","Bill Nye, the Science Guy on TV, also heads Planetary Society .

"St. Louis, Missouri (CNN)  -- Timothy G. Hendron's co-workers were expecting him at their Missouri workplace Thursday. He arrived wearing typical office attire: Dockers and a button-down, collared shirt. But, police said Friday, Hendron also donned a fanny pack filled with magazines for the guns he allegedly used to pop off more than 100 rounds, killing three and wounding five others. Hendron arrived at work armed with hundreds of bullets and an assault rifle, two handguns and a shotgun, St. Louis Police Capt. Michael Sack said at a news conference Friday. He opened fire at about 6:30 a.m. (7:30 a.m. ET) Thursday at ABB Inc., a St. Louis transformer manufacturing company, police said. When they entered the facility, Sack said, police found ""a gruesome scene"" -- the dead and wounded and those employees desperately hiding from the shooter. The 51-year-old suspect was found inside an ABB Inc. office dead from a self-inflicted gunshot wound, police said. Carlton J. Carter, 57; Terry Mabry, 55; and Cory Wilson, 27, were dead from gunshot wounds to the head. Mabry also was shot in a leg and Wilson was also shot in a shoulder, according to authorities. Police were investigating whether the shooter targeted the victims, Sack said. Police are also looking into the motive for the shooting, but Sack said it could remain a mystery. ""I would imagine that you could say yes [it was premeditated], because most people don't come to work armed in such a manner, but that's just speculation,"" Sack said. ""We have to go back and try and figure out what motivated him and like I said, we may never truly know what motivated him to do this."" Sack said police are looking into Hendron's work history and his personal relationships. Hendron was one of a group of ABB employees listed in a lawsuit filed in 2006 against administrators of the company's retirement plan. Police said they were working closely with ABB executives to get more information about the suspect and his status with the company prior to the incident. ABB spokesman Bob Fesmire said Thursday there are about 100 employees who work at the facility, but some of them were unable to come in Thursday because of heavy snow. Police estimated 40 to 50 employees were in the building at the time of the incident. The federal suit filed by Hendron and others accuses pension plan administrators of, among other things, causing the plan to include ""unreasonable and excessive"" fees and expenses, paid by participants, without their knowledge and not used for their benefit or that of the plan. Linda Siegfried, a spokeswoman for the law firm representing the plaintiffs, told CNN on Thursday that Hendron was among the plaintiffs, although his name is spelled three different ways in court documents. A trial on the matter is currently being held in Kansas City, Missouri, Siegfried said. She didn't know whether Hendron would have been required to be present. Online federal court records show the trial began January 5. Siegfried would not comment further except to say the firm offers its concern for the welfare of the victims.","Timothy G.

"(CNN) -- The town of Derna is not much to look at -- a heap of Soviet-style concrete buildings in a deprived and windswept corner of eastern Libya. But it has a rich history -- fought over and colonized since Roman times -- and a stunning location on the Mediterranean. It has also gained a reputation as a hotbed of jihadists. And that has diplomats and analysts asking whether the unrest in Libya might provide an opening for al Qaeda and fellow travelers, just a short hop from Europe. Derna even made it into U.S. diplomatic cables obtained by Wikileaks. A cable from 2008 describes it as a ""wellspring of Libyan foreign fighters"" for al Qaeda in Iraq. High youth unemployment, discrimination by the Gadhafi regime and the influence of veteran Libyan jihadists from Afghanistan all played a role in radicalizing a new generation. ""Other factors include a dearth of social outlets for young people, [and] local pride in Derna's history as a locus of fierce opposition to occupation,"" the cable said. ""Most young men watched a mix of al-Jazeera news, religious sermons and western action films on English language satellite channels broadcast from the Gulf. The result was a heady mixture of violence, religious conservatism and hatred of U.S. policy in Iraq and Palestine."" Today, Derna is very much in the opposition's hands, and accounts from eastern Libya say Islamists and others are fighting side-by-side with one aim: removing Moammar Gadhafi. But what comes next? Gadhafi has been quick to raise the specter of al Qaeda as the beneficiary of unrest in Libya, even claiming that it was drugging young Libyans into opposing his rule. The regime has also paraded a former member of the Libyan Islamist Fighting Group who had allegedly been ""captured"" during fighting in Zawiyah. While the regime's claims may seem outlandish, a former leader of Libyan jihadists tells CNN that al Qaeda will seek to take advantage of chaos in Libya. ""If there is a power vacuum in Libya there will be an open market for al Qaeda,"" says Noman Benotman, a former commander in the Libyan Islamic Fighting Group and one-time ally of Osama bin Laden. The LIFG fought the Gadhafi regime in the 1990s, but formally ended its campaign to overthrow the Libyan regime two years ago, and repudiated al Qaeda. Benotman is now a senior researcher at the Quilliam Foundation in London, a counter-terrorism think tank. Having played no role in the rebellion so far, al Qaeda and its affiliates will have to play catch-up if they do want to exploit the situation, says Benotman. Individuals who might have jihadist sympathies are keeping them under wraps for the sake of uniting with one aim: removing Gadhafi, he says. Added to which there has been a broad welcome among Libyan rebels of all stripes for U.S. and coalition airstrikes to protect the city of Benghazi. According to Benotman, dozens of former LIFG fighters have now joined rebel efforts to topple Gadhafi, but he stressed that they had done so in a personal capacity rather than organizing operations as a group. Protest movements across the Middle East -- predominantly secular and pro-democracy -- have so far reduced the jihadist message to irrelevance. But Benotman sees potentially dangerous parallels in Libya with neighboring Algeria and with Afghanistan. After the Soviet withdrawal in 1989, the West walked away from Afghanistan rather than use its ""soft power"" to bring about positive change, he says. The Taliban eventually filled the void. As a young jihadist, Benotman was there to witness it. And in Algeria, a 1992 army coup following electoral gains by radical Islamist parties spawned a violent insurgency. More than 100,000 Algerians were killed in a savage conflict between the state and Islamist extremists before the insurgency waned in the mid-1990s. Some Western counter-terrorism officials fret that a prolonged civil war in Libya could open up space for al Qaeda. Governments and NGOs have to be quick, says Benotman, in helping rebel-held areas develop education, health-care and the institutions of democracy. Libya -- like Yemen -- has a less developed ""civil society"" than either Egypt or Tunisia after 40 years of authoritarian rule. It also has entrenched tribal rivalries and a small middle class. Such conditions were compounded by Gadhafi's strategy of divide and rule through a baffling array of competing power centers. Al Qaeda has already scented an opportunity. Its leading ideologue, Abu Yahya al-Libi -- himself a Libyan -- told Islamists in the country: ""Store your weapons and do not relinquish them."" In an audio tape released on March 12, he said that ""ousting these regimes is not the end in making a change."" A week later the leader of al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM) had a similar message. In an audiotape posted on Jihadist websites and translated by the SITE Intelligence Group, Abu Musab Wadud told Gadhafi's opponents: ""We will be side-by-side with you, Allah willing."" Until now, That may be wishful thinking. AQIM has in recent times been restricted to remote parts of Mali, Niger and Mauritania and has suffered leadership splits. Wadud may also have damaged his cause by predicting the United States and NATO would never help the rebels because they were the ""source of the disaster."" But al Qaeda is nothing if not persistent. And there is a long history of Islamist radicalization in Libya, especially in the impoverished, restive eastern provinces. At the peak of the Iraqi insurgency, more jihadists per capita traveled to join al Qaeda in Iraq from Libya than from any other country. And according to al Qaeda records seized by the U.S. Army in Iraq, in 2006-07 more volunteers -- a total of 53 -- travelled to Iraq from Derna than any other city in the Arab world. And in the 1990s, Benotman's group had tried to establish a safe haven in Derna, eventually being bombed into submission by the Libyan air force. Which brings us back to the U.S. cable from 2008, in which an American diplomat who traveled to Derna, quoted a local businessman who had ""likened young men in Derna to Bruce Willis' character in the action picture 'Die Hard,' who stubbornly refused to die quietly. For them, resistance against coalition forces in Iraq is an important act of 'jihad' and a last act of defiance against the Gadhafi regime."" ""It's jihad -- it's our duty, and you're talking about people who don't have much else to be proud of,"" he said. Maybe that at last is changing.","A former Libyan jihadist says al Qaeda will seek to take advantage of chaos in Libya .

"(CNN) -- Juice -- a basic staple of any hotel stay, right? Out on the breakfast buffet, with OJ leading the way and perhaps a choice of grapefruit, apple or tomato for the daring few who may feel like deviating from the mainstream. Well, think again. Juice -- freshly-squeezed from an arcane assortment of veggies as well as fruit, and in more combinations than you can imagine, has become a unique selling point at several hotels this year. These are places that believe juice is not just for breakfast, but at the center of wellness or detox programs they say jaded travelers are crying out for. ""Business as well as leisure guests are buying big into our juice offerings,"" says Mina Gough, spa director of The Standard, Miami, which has done so well with a new juice and wellness program, other hotels in the group are preparing to follow suit. ""There's been a real buzz in the group about how so many different categories of guests have embraced the chance to detox with fresh juice,"" she says. ""Business travelers may not be able to devote themselves to the full wellness program, with scrubs and massages, but they'll still do juice for breakfast and lunch, then go out for a regular business dinner. ""They like the way it makes them feel so much, many finish their stay with a full-day juice detox."" These are not any old juices -- for morning, The Standard is currently blending cantaloupe and ginger into its freshly-squeezed OJ -- the ginger works as an anti-inflammatory -- and proposing a pint of tomato-carrot-red pepper-cucumber-fennel and lime juice midmorning to improve digestive health. It gets a little out there by evening, when a pint of green juice pressed from kale, collard greens, romaine, cucumber and green apple is proposed as a meal replacement designed to detox the blood. Working in the hotel? Room service is ready to deliver coconut water to sip throughout the day. A less likely venue than a Miami Beach spa for a detox program is a big city hotel. But the InterContinental on London's Park Lane is introducing just that, under the direction of Thandie Newton's naturopath, Elizabeth Peyton-Jones. ""It will give all the tools and support needed to begin a new lifestyle, including a pre-stay fridge analysis, a two-week detox and a follow-up motivation call,"" says hotel spokesperson Patty Kahn. ""We know many guests are looking for ways to maintain a healthy lifestyle while traveling,"" she adds, noting that the hotel will also create juices to guests' own specifications, even if they're not registered for the detox experience, which must be booked ahead. No advance warning, however, is needed for delivery of an Antioxidant Revival drink (apple, raspberry and blackberry juice), a Vitamin C Blast (orange, mango and pineapple), an apple-ginger-cucumber Booster and similar health drinks. All are available at every bar and restaurant in the hotel or 24/7 via Room Service. Another London hotel embracing juice in a big way is the uber-cool Sanderson, whose Long Bar has a ""sin-free"" section where mixologists create health drinks. Choices include the Cellulite Reduction Cocktail (pink grapefruit, orange, dandelion, burdock, lemon and pineapple juice) and the Jetlag Rescue Smoothie in which scary-sounding ""stabilized oxygen"" is added to orange juice with hemp seeds and vitamin C powder. In the Agua spa, guests can find more exotic drinks like goji berries from the high Tibetan plateau, blended with seaberry, pomegranate or lychee juice. Guests can also create their own smoothies at the Sanderson, indicating that juicing may become an activity in its own right rather than merely a means to an end. At the Four Seasons Biltmore in Santa Barbara, California, guests can create their own combinations from an assortment of fruit and veg including kale, beets, parsley, ginger and celery at the Fins organic juice bar. And the Travaasa ""experiential"" resort is offering an actual class in pressing fresh juice at both its Austin, Texas and Maui properties -- yes, it's called Juicing 2.0. And it's also not just for breakfast -- guests learn to convert what they've pressed into soups, dips, spreads, desserts and salsas as well as mere healthy juices. Other places to get stuck seriously into the fresh stuff include: . LaSource, Grenada This luxury, all-inclusive spa resort puts fresh juice at the center of its holistic offerings, allowing lots of experimentation at no extra cost. The cafe-deli features such unusual combinations as the High C (celery stalks, carrot, parsley and asparagus) to prevent arthritis and lower blood pressure, the anti-oxidant ABC Trio (apple, beet and carrot) and the Power Ball high-protein drink involving fresh papaya juice and - er - peanut butter. It contains soy isoflavones which some say help reduce bad cholesterol, regulate glucose levels and improve kidney filtration. Missoni, Kuwait Creative Director Rosita Missoni has created juice pairings for food in the restaurants and bars of the fashion brand's first resort, as well as a range of stylish ""mocktails."" Guests can opt for a ""heavenly orchard,"" featuring, apple, pear, quince and citrus juices blended with locally-grown cinnamon. They can get a blackberry julep in which the berries are pressed with plenty of fresh mint, then hit with fresh lime juice and a shot of sparkling water. Destinations where you don't need a fancy hotel to get superb freshly-squeezed juice include: . Bali -- Juice stands abound, pressing everything from bananas (much juicier than starchy western varieties) to avocados, with all the other usual fruit and veggie suspects. Your hotel will offer them too. Israel -- Residents love fresh carrot juice even more than their freshly squeezed OJ, and often combine them half and half. Look for juice stands everywhere in Tel Aviv and Jerusalem, and expect to find fresh carrot juice on the breakfast buffet alongside a wide variety of other juices. Morocco -- Freshly squeezed OJ is a birthright in this country, and in Marrakech you'll find at least 20 stands competing for your business on the main square, the Dja el Fnaa. Since it costs less than 35 cents a glass, you can try all the vendors to find your favorite before your stay is out, but you may want to bring your own glass for hygiene reasons. On a scale of 1 to 10, how do you feel about healthy options at hotels? What are your favorite offerings?","Hotels are catering to guests' desire for a shot of health away from home .

"(CNN) -- Last week, powerhouse wedding gown designer Vera Wang announced that she and her husband of 23 years, Arthur Becker, were separating. ""Vera Wang and Arthur Becker have mutually and amicably agreed to separate. They remain devoted parents to their two daughters,"" Mario Grauso, the president of the Vera Wang Group, said in a statement to CNN. The couple married in 1989 when Wang was a design director at Ralph Lauren and Becker was a stockbroker at Bear Stearns & Co. Before her tenure at Ralph Lauren, Wang worked at Vogue magazine for more than 15 years. Wang, 63, launched her label in 1990, a year after her own wedding, with a prestigious Madison Avenue address on New York City's Upper East Side. She opened Bridal House Ltd., as it was called at the time, because she noticed something was missing from bridal gowns during her own wedding planning: art. Tamara Albu, an associate professor of fashion design at Parsons The New School of Design, said Wang revolutionized the way people looked at the wedding gown; she upped the sophistication and made the gown an expression of a state of mind, not just a marker of a special occasion. ""She understands women who embrace fashion. In her case, she markets the wedding gown as a personification of love and beauty, not herself,"" she said. However, Wang's recent announcement has caused speculation as to whether her fairy-tale aesthetic will be affected by her own not-so-happily-ever-after ending. Wang's empire has grown into a multitiered, multimillion-dollar effort, a marriage of ready-to-wear and sportswear, as well as bedding, eyewear, fragrance, stationery, luggage, footwear, tableware and flower collections. Ivanka Trump, Chelsea Clinton and Victoria Beckham are just a few of the influential people who have said ""I do"" donning Vera Wang. Nowadays, designers sell a lifestyle, and with it, their clothes and accessories. Diane von Furstenberg is renowned for her iconic wrap dress and signature prints for the ever-sassy career woman -- embodying the DVF label. Donatella Versace is synonymous with over-the-top prints and unabashed sexiness, fitting for her brand's Miami jet-set look. For Wang, it was romanticism. ""Vera Wang is a magnificent designer who has created a unique aspirational world that alludes to sensuality and youthful sophistication. Exquisite details, intricate draping and a nonchalant sense of style characterize the Vera Wang aesthetic,"" Albu said. Does the end of Wang's marriage mean her enchanted empire is in danger? Albu says not necessarily. Wang's Fall 2012 bridal collection departed from the typical matrimonial hues of white and ivory and included several black wedding dresses, while her spring 2013 bridal collection was emblazoned with scarlet-hued gowns. Both are creative decisions Albu says could have been foretelling of Wang's own marital woes. ""I think there is something there. This didn't occur overnight and (is), in a way, a symbolic gesture. Creative people do take their inspiration from everywhere, including their own personal life,"" Albu said. However, fashion experts like Albu also say Wang's customers are looking for their own fantasy -- not trying to mimic the designer's. ""Without doubt, every bride has her own fantasy about her own wedding. Does this fantasy include the personal life of her dress designer? I don't think so,"" Albu said. ""It is about a dream and an image and not a projection of someone that is instrumental in setting the stage,"" she said. Molly R. Leis, who owns the retail marketing firm MRL Communications, agrees Wang's personal life won't drive away sales because she never made it a part of the story. ""The Vera Wang brand does not sell her personal love story nor her marriage, but the soul of a New Yorker dedicated to offering women a luxury lifestyle brand,"" said Leis, who is also a former director of marketing for Saks Fifth Avenue New York. ""Vera sells a lifestyle beyond the wedding. The dream she sells is that of an ambitious, driven, determined woman destined for success. She is often photographed and interviewed alone without mention or sight of her husband,"" she said. Reports have indicated that Becker, a successful businessman, played a significant role in expanding the Vera Wang brand, and neither party has commented on how their marital split might affect the company's operations. But for customers devoted to Wang's designs, it doesn't change the bottom line. Alli Sosna of Washington, D.C., will walk down the aisle on June 8, 2013, in a Wang gown. The 27-year-old says she didn't, and still doesn't, consider the designer's personal life in her decision. ""I saw myself comfortable in my own skin, in a well-fitted elegant dress on a very important day in my life,"" Sosna said. ""The design spoke to me, not the artist's marital status, but what she stands for. If anything, her dresses are probably going to get better since she will be back on the market and falling in love again."" And if there's anything popular culture loves more than a fairy tale, it's a second chance at love. Are your fashion buying decisions influenced by a designer's personal life? Would you buy a Vera Wang gown post-split? Share your opinion in the comments section below.

Vick, who spent about 18 months in federal prison after pleading guilty to dogfighting charges in 2007, has been trying to turn his life and his image around in recent years. Vick helps park get a second chance . In September, he continued his rehabilitation campaign by donating about $200,000 for a new football field for a Philadelphia inner-city youth football team. At the time, Vick said the donation was a gift to the City of Brotherly Love for embracing him after the Eagles signed him following his release from prison. But not all have embraced the new Michael Vick. The quarterback was set to promote his new autobiography ""Finally Free,"" but had to cancel upcoming dates across the country after threats to Barnes & Noble Booksellers and an independent bookstore in New Jersey. ""It is disturbing that a few extremists would threaten Vick's family and store employees,"" said Vick's spokesman Chris Shigas. ""Michael Vick has millions of fans and has countless letters from teachers thanking him for inspiring students to make positive change."" Last year, Vick announced he had gotten a dog for his family in an effort to show his children how to have a healthy relationship with animals. ""This is an opportunity to break the cycle,"" Vick said in a statement in October. ""To that end, I will continue to honor my commitment to animal welfare and be an instrument of positive change.""

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Shortly before leaving the White House in 1829, John Quincy Adams reportedly said, ""There is nothing more pathetic in life than a former president."" Ex-presidents George H.W. Bush, Jimmy Carter and Bill Clinton have stayed in the public eye since leaving office. If he had had a crystal ball, Adams might have tweaked that statement to say there is nothing more lucrative in life than to be a former president. Last Friday, we learned that the Clintons have made a whopping $109 million since 2001. Bill Clinton has brought in almost $52 million from speeches generally going for $250,000 a pop. He earned somewhere in the ballpark of $15 million from his partnership with billionaire investor Ron Burkle. And don't forget the $15 million advance from his 2004 autobiography, ""My Life."" So much for the ""sacrifice"" of public service. But before bemoaning Clinton's selling of the ex-presidency, a little historical perspective is in order. There's nothing original about what the former president has done -- it's just the magnitude of the proceeds. The precedent was set long before he said goodbye to the Oval Office. Clinton's immediate predecessors weren't too reluctant to use their stature to pad their bank accounts. Gerald Ford capitalized on his accidental 2Â½ years as chief executive by accepting positions on the boards of American Express and 20th Century Fox, among others. Ronald Reagan caused a stir when he netted $2 million dollars for a couple of 20-minute speeches in Japan in 1989. George H.W. Bush has held seats on a number of corporate boards and traveled extensively to deliver paid speeches. Even Jimmy Carter, who has by all accounts been a model ex-president through his globetrotting humanitarian work, has not been shy about accepting financial compensation for addressing audiences. Some former presidents have been more loathe than others to cash in on the unique fame and honor that accompanies the highest office in the land. Harry Truman wrote in his memoirs, ""I could never lend myself to any transaction, however respectable, that would commercialize on the prestige and dignity of the office of the presidency."" Impressive sentiments from a man whose only source of government support after leaving office in 1953 was, according to historian David McCullough, an Army pension of $112.56 a month. Historian Richard Norton Smith writes that the famously frugal Calvin Coolidge was so reluctant to cash in on his fame that he had name tags and tailor marks removed from old suits before reselling them. But don't feel so bad for Silent Cal. His $3,000-a-week column didn't hurt. Neither did his acquisition of 8,000 preferred shares of J.P. Morgan securities which, according to Smith, were priced below market value. Apparently the definition of ""cashing in"" is in the eye of the beholder. If you're looking for a role model from the bland, bearded roster of late 19th century ex-presidents, try Rutherford B. Hayes. When his term expired in 1881, he moved back to Ohio and reportedly became a successful chicken farmer. Benjamin Harrison and Grover Cleveland both returned to their legal careers after leaving office. Harrison actually went to work for a foreign power, serving as lead counsel for the government of Venezuela during the arbitration of its boundary dispute with Great Britain. (Don't tell me you've never heard of the infamous Venezuela-British Guiana boundary arbitration of 1899.) Then there's the big loser of the ex-president's club: the hapless Ulysses S. Grant. He decided to join his sons in a partnership in the New York-based brokerage firm of Grant & Ward. Big mistake. The firm was poorly run, and the northern hero of the Civil War lost almost everything but the shirt on his back. A sympathetic Congress restored Grant's military pension, but the old general didn't restore his family's financial position until penning his best-selling memoirs. Sadly, Grant himself never got to enjoy the $450,000 in royalties generated by the publication of his memoirs. A lifelong cigar lover, he died of throat cancer less than a week after completing the text. Perhaps Grant's brush with poverty was partly what inspired Gilded Age icon Andrew Carnegie to propose, in November of 1912, the establishment of a pension providing $25,000 annually to all ex-presidents and their widows. The object of the pension, according to a statement released by Carnegie at the time, was to ensure that former presidents ""may spend their latter days devoting their unique knowledge gained of public affairs to the public good free from pecuniary cares."" Generous man, that Carnegie. Adjusted for inflation, his offer translates to almost $550,000 today. Carnegie was willing to fund the pension himself -- a fact that wasn't well received by his congressional critics. Forty-six years later, Congress finally got around to establishing a publicly funded presidential pension. That pension is now worth $191,300 annually, with a bit more thrown in to support a former president's office staff. It's not quite as generous as Carnegie's proposal, but it's not exactly poverty either. Has the establishment of a pension freed our former presidents from their ""pecuniary cares""? Not quite. But maybe we shouldn't act so surprised. After all, as they always like to remind us, our presidents are also our fellow Americans. And at the end of the day, what is more American than making money?

"(CNN) -- After the Denver shootings during a showing of ""Dark Knight Rises,"" Warner Bros. swiftly withdrew the trailer of ""Gangster Squad"" from before the Nolan film and reportedly removed a sequence in which gangsters shoot up a movie theater from behind the screen. Now ""Gangster Squad"" emerges just a month after the Newtown killings, a titillating but anodyne piece of gun glamour for the masses. Inspired by Paul Lieberman's series for the Los Angeles Times, ""Tales from the Gangster Squad,"" the movie ducks the obvious comparisons with ""LA Confidential,"" ""Mulholland Falls"" and ""Bugsy"" by opting for a pulpy vibe and poppy, comic book visuals. This is no ""Chinatown"" exercise in history as neo-noir, and it's sure no James Ellroy-style take down of the LAPD (the controversial 1950s Police Chief William Parker -- played by Nick Nolte - gets a free pass for instigating what amounts to a vigilante hit-squad operating beyond any legal jurisdiction). Rather it's a gleaming, glossy parade of good-looking actors trading quips and striking poses in sexy period duds, only a couple of stops more naturalistic than ""Sin City"" or ""Dick Tracy."" And it's Beatty's film that comes to mind most immediately, with Sean Penn channeling a snarling Al Pacino (and showing off a striking prosthetic nose) as ambitious LA racketeer Mickey Cohen, an all purpose bad guy who orders a Chicago rival to be chained to two autos and ripped in half in the film's first minute. Within another 60 seconds Josh Brolin's square-jawed Sgt. O'Mara has established his impeccable heroic credentials by crashing one of Cohen's brothels, shooting or beating up five of his henchmen and rescuing an innocent dame from a fate worse than death -- all to the consternation of his immediate superiors, but impressing the heck out of Chief Parker. ""Don't make arrests,"" Parker growls. ""This is occupied territory. Wage guerrilla warfare."" For a spell the movie corrects to an engagingly fizzy tone. O'Mara's shrewd and pregnant wife (the excellent Mireille Enos) handpicks his squad. There's a sharpshooter nicknamed ""Cowboy"" she read about in True Detective magazine (Robert Patrick); a brainiac who knows how to set up a wiretap (Giovanni Ribisi). Anachronistically, for Parker's LAPD, there's also an African-American who is handy with a knife (Anthony Mackie) and a Latino who muscles in on the action (Michael Pena). Their first intervention is deliciously botched. And then they're faced with getting out of Burbank alive. For all its historical liberties, the movie does have fun re-creating mid-century Los Angeles. Last to sign up is Ryan Gosling's Sgt. Jerry Wooters, an easygoing womanizer who happens to be sleeping with Mickey Cohen's girl (Emma Stone doing a very passable Bacall), and whose less rigid approach to the job is meant to color our admiration for O'Mara's righteousness. But the more seriously ""Zombieland"" director Ruben Fleischer takes the material, the more vapid it comes off. Some glaring gaps in third act story logic don't help, but the whole Gosling and Brolin dynamic never really snaps into place. Are they old war buddies? You can believe Brolin has seen some action, but Gosling just comes off as wet behind the ears -- there's no rapport between them, and no real reason to care when things go sour. ""Gangster Squad"" looks the part, but it's so superficial it practically evaporates before our eyes.","Josh Brolin, Sean Penn, Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone star in ""Gangster Squad""

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- An Army sergeant complained about faulty wiring in Iraq months before another soldier was fatally electrocuted in a shower in the same quarters, according to documents released Wednesday by a congressional committee. Ryan Maseth, a 24-year-old Green Beret, died in his shower January 2. Sgt. Justin Hummer filled out a work order in July 2007 that warned, ""Pipes have voltage, get shocked in the shower."" Hummer told investigators from the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee that at least once, he had to use a wooden stick to turn off the shower ""because the electrical current was so strong."" Army records show that electricians from contractor Kellogg, Brown and Root found ""several safety issues concerning the improper grounding of electrical devices"" in February 2007. In January 2008, Staff Sgt. Ryan Maseth was electrocuted in a shower in the same quarters where Hummer lived the previous summer. A follow-up investigation ""found nearly all of the same problems and deficiencies that had been reported one year previously,"" a committee report states. Maseth and Hummer had been based at a Saddam Hussein-era palace complex near the Baghdad airport. Hummer's concerns were not shared with the Defense Department's inspector-general's office. That office concluded that there was ""no credible evidence"" that KBR and the Pentagon agency that oversees defense contractors were aware of electrical problems at the facility, committee Chairman Henry Waxman said during a Wednesday hearing. But the Pentagon's inspector-general, Gordon Heddell, said that his investigators ""have absolved no one"" and that he was not aware of the work orders Hummer filed. ""They're certainly very dramatic, and they certainly are documents that we will have to spend a lot of time looking at,"" he said. Waxman, D-California, has led a House investigation into a series of electrical accidents in Iraq that he said may have been responsible for the deaths of 19 U.S. troops and contractors. But in the first appearance by a KBR executive before the panel, the company's Baghdad engineering and construction manager blamed the Army for the deaths. ""The reality is that KBR's actions were not the cause of any of these terrible accidents,"" Tom Bruni said. KBR is a former subsidiary of the oilfield-services giant Halliburton, once led by Vice President Dick Cheney, and it holds the largest U.S. service contract in Iraq. Bruni's argument drew sharp questions from Rep. Tom Davis, the committee's ranking Republican, who pressed him on who was responsible for the deaths. ""I think that the Army has some responsibility in this,"" Bruni said. ""Well, if they have some, who would have the rest?"" the Virginia representative asked. ""Just conceivably, who else could have it, if the Army just has some responsibility? Would KBR have some then?"" ""The responsibility lies with the Army,"" Bruni replied. He said the Army never authorized the electrical repairs identified in early 2007 or in a follow-up report that November. But Waxman said the Army had been warning of electrical hazards in Iraq since 2004, including one fatality similar to Maseth's. A report that year warned U.S. commanders that contractors must properly ground electrical systems. ""But despite these warnings, few actions were taken by Pentagon leadership or KBR officials,"" Waxman said. Jeffrey Parsons, executive director of the Army Contracting Command, said the service does not have the expertise to adequately oversee contractors' electrical work. The service is working with the Corps of Engineers ""to obtain this expertise,"" Parsons said. Maseth's parents have filed a wrongful-death lawsuit in a Pennsylvania court against KBR. Despite the attention focused on the issue by Waxman's committee, Sen. Bob Casey, D-Pennsylvania, said that poor wiring remains ""a genuine danger to our men and women serving in Iraq."" ""My office has heard from several active-duty soldiers a report that as recently as three weeks ago, soldiers in Iraq continued to receive electrical shocks on a regular basis as they carry out their daily activities, including taking showers,"" Casey told the committee. Do you have a tip or story idea? Send it to the CNN: Special Investigations Unit.

"(CNN) -- A same-sex ceremony between an enlisted woman and a civilian woman on a U.S. Army post last month drew protests from lawmakers Thursday. The ""private religious ceremony"" took place at Fort Polk in Louisiana in May, post spokesman Scott Stearns said, but he would confirm few other details. Rep. John Fleming, a Louisiana Republican whose congressional district includes the Army post, said the military confirmed to him that the same-sex ceremony was performed by an Army chaplain in the chapel. The incident was an inevitable consequence of the end of the don't ask, don't tell policy in September, which previously banned homosexuals from military service, Fleming said. ""The liberal social experiment with our military continues,"" Fleming said. ""A same-sex marriage-like ceremony should not have occurred at Fort Polk, especially since the people of Louisiana have made it abundantly clear that our state does not recognize same-sex marriages or civil unions."" Rep. Todd Akin, a Missouri Republican whose office said has been working ""to protect traditional marriage on military bases,"" said the ceremony was ""clearly in contravention of state law and also violates the Defense Department policies issued last fall."" ""It is very concerning that a same-sex ceremony would occur on a military base in a state where the definition of marriage has been clearly defined as between one man and one woman,"" Akin said. Military personnel can reserve post facilities for private events such as weddings or other ceremonies, Human Rights Campaign spokesman Charles Joughin said. ""The sexual orientation of those involved in a private event shouldn't have any relevance to whether or not people can access facilities that are open to everyone,"" Joughin said. Fleming and Akin both called for the passage of legislation that prevents military facilities from being used for same-sex marriages or marriage-like ceremonies. CNN's Devon Sayers and Rick Martin contributed to this report.","Army chaplain performed same-sex ceremony in Fort Polk chapel, Rep. John Fleming says .

"(CNN)  -- Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama is in Afghanistan on a multistop overseas trip for meetings with international leaders but with an eye on the U.S. presidential race back home. Sen. Barack Obama is expected to visit several world leaders over the next few weeks. Obama's trip, which includes visits to Iraq, Jordan, Israel, Germany, France and the United Kingdom, is intended to bolster his foreign policy credentials before U.S. voters. ""This is the campaign trail via satellite -- pictures for the rhetoric back home,"" CNN's Candy Crowley said, adding that the trip was intended to demonstrate that Obama was up to the job of taking a lead role on the international stage. ""The question is, is he tough enough to stand up for America but graceful enough to improve [its] image?"" Crowley said.  Watch what Obama needs from this trip Â» . In a recent Washington Post/ABC News poll, 48 percent of registered voters said Obama would make a good commander in chief, compared with 72 percent for his Republican rival, John McCain. ""The message to voters back home is that he is focused on being a strong and effective commander in chief who is going to rehabilitate our image across the world,"" Democratic Sen. Evan Bayh said. But a spokeswoman for McCain said Thursday that Obama's trip was politically motivated. ""It's about politics. It's a way for Obama to try and compete on foreign policy,"" Jill Hazelbaker said. Obama arrived Saturday in Afghanistan. He is also scheduled to visit Iraq with two Senate colleagues, Democrat Jack Reed and Republican Chuck Hagel. McCain has visited both countries and accuses his rival of naivete for suggesting that Iraq had distracted the United States from the growing conflict in Afghanistan.  Watch how the candidates are battling over Iraq Â» . ""To say that Iraq is somehow disconnected from Afghanistan shows, again, incredible naivete,"" McCain said this week. A video released by the McCain campaign also accused Obama of ""flip-flopping"" over his plans to withdraw troops from Iraq. The campaign also aired its first negative advertisement of the season, hitting Obama on foreign policy issues. A diplomatic source told Time magazine that King Abdullah II of Jordan would urge Obama, if elected, to make Arab-Israeli peace talks a higher priority than has been the case under President Bush. Obama is expected to meet Israel's top leaders:  President Shimon Peres, Prime Minister Ehud Olmert, Defense Minister Ehud Barak, Foreign Minister Tzipi Livni and Likud Party leader Benjamin Netanyahu; and Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas and Prime Minister Salaam Fayad. Obama can expect a friendly reception in Europe, where he will meet Thursday with German Chancellor Angela Merkel. CNN European political editor Robin Oakley said Obama's campaign has captured the public imagination there -- though he will be keen to avoid the sort of suggestions that he is ""too European"" that dogged 2004 Democratic presidential nominee John Kerry. ""I was talking to a former British foreign secretary this week, and he said, 'It's like JFK [John F. Kennedy].' He said it may not be justified, it may not be sensible, but that is the feeling,"" Oakley said. But the trip would also offer a more critical opportunity to gauge Obama's suitability for statesmanship, Oakley said: ""People have been saying to me, 'Look, this guy has only been in national politics for three years, let alone international politics.' We don't really know exactly what he is going to do."" In addition to Merkel, Obama is slated to meet with British Prime Minister Gordon Brown and Conservative Party Leader David Cameron as well as French President Nicolas Sarkozy.","NEW: Obama, 2 other senators in Afghanistan; Iraq also on itinerary .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- You might have thought that recycling is limited to paper, plastics and glass. Well, think again. A Californian company is developing a new technique for recycling carbon dioxide, or CO2, and turning it back into fuel. Carbon Sciences are developing a ""breakthrough technology"" to make fuel out of waste CO2. Carbon Sciences believe they have made a breakthrough with their technology, which they say can transform CO2 back into basic fuel building blocks efficiently. Their biocatalytic process converts CO2 into basic hydrocarbons - C1 (methane) C2 (ethane) and C3 (propane) -- which can then be utilized to make higher-grade fuels like gasoline and jet fuel. ""We are very excited by what we've seen in the lab. We've had some promising results,"" Derek McLeish, President and CEO of the Santa Barbara-based company, told CNN. By employing biocatalysis -- using natural catalysts to perform chemical reactions -- Carbon Sciences hope to bypass the problem of inefficient energy ratios which can render many CO2 recycling projects pointless. ""We don't use high temperatures or high pressures, which is a huge advantage in terms of scaling the project up,"" McLeish said. In the future, McLeish envisages Carbon Sciences setting up shop next door to large CO2 emitters -- coal, gas-fired plants and oil refineries -- recycling concentrated streams of CO2 discharged from fossil fuel plants. Trying to take CO2 out of natural air just wouldn't be worth it. ""The beauty of this system is the whole infrastructure to distribute, to market and to use it is already in place,"" he said. The recycling process has five main stages. After rudimentary purification and regeneration of the biocatalysts, the CO2 is transferred to a Biocatalytic Reactor Matrix where mass quantities of biocatalysts function in a matrix of liquid reaction chambers breaking down CO2 and turning it into hydrocarbons. Liquids are then filtered and gases are extracted through condensers ready for conversion to higher grade fuel. Carbon Sciences are just one of many companies all over the world who are beavering away trying to find effective methods of renewing CO2. The science is well known, but practical energy effective devices are in short supply. Scientists at Sandia National Laboratories in New Mexico are exploring the idea of using concentrated solar energy to turn CO2 into fuel. The Sunshine to Petrol project is testing a prototype device called the Counter Rotating Ring Receiver Reactor Recuperator (called CR5 for short) which turns CO2 into carbon monoxide which could then form part of a liquid fuel. Others, like Michael North, Professor of Organic Chemistry at Newcastle University in the UK, are looking at transforming CO2 into useful chemical compounds called cyclic carbonates for industrial use. Professor North says recycling CO2 may be more vital for the chemical industries than for fuel production. ""People don't seem to realize that ten percent of everything that comes out of an oil well doesn't go to the fuel industry, it drives the chemical industry. So not only are we facing a fuel crisis but the entire chemical industry is likely to cease to exist. So we desperately need to find ways of making basic chemical materials out of CO2 to keep the chemical industries ticking over. Professor North and his team are currently in discussions with some potential investors. He believes that Carbon Sciences' program sounds feasible. ""They will need to address issues about how long the biocatalysts are active for before they need replacing. If they only work for a day then you are going to be getting through tons and tons of biocatalyst for each ton of CO2. ""Biocatalyst life span and poisoning -- by things like nitrous oxide, sulfur dioxide and other impurities - will be the issues determining how feasible it is and how cost effective it is,"" he said. While McLeish doesn't envisage his biocatalytic technology being able to service the fuel needs of all motorists, he is confident that it can perform profitably on a smaller scale. ""Transportation uses transportable fuels. We need renewables -- wind, tidal -- but these are not useable in the transport sector. One of the challenges in the future will be transportation,"" he said. ""The grand vision here is to take waste, build it into a portable fuel and make it useful."" McLeish recently presented his ideas to a climate conference at Cambridge University in the UK where they were warmly received. And if all goes to plan the company will start a pilot project in 2009. The conference also gave him the opportunity to promote another Carbon Sciences venture: turning CO2 into precipitated calcium carbonate. Like Professor North, his target is the industrial sector; in particular the paper, plastics and pharmaceutical manufacturers. Another potential benefit of recycling CO2 will be the reduction of large scale geosequestration. The problem of rising CO2 emissions was highlighted again recently with the publication of the Global Carbon Project's Carbon Budget 2007. Concentrations of atmospheric CO2 have risen to 383 parts per million. A rise of 2.2 ppm on 2006 figures. Of 28 billion metric tons of CO2 released into the atmosphere, fossil fuel emissions accounted for almost a third. Although some climate critics might scoff at the idea of recycling CO2 arguing that we should be emitting less rather than recycling a pollutant, reusing it may well prove effective in kick-starting a new carbon market, as well as helping clean up our increasingly polluted planet.","Californian company testing a revolutionary new method of recycling CO2 into fuel .

"Gioia Del Colle, Italy (CNN) -- Even as British RAF Typhoons took to the skies from this southern Italian air base, there was mounting tension between allies about who should command the mission to protect civilians and enforce a no-fly zone in Libya. After heated exchanges between NATO ambassadors in Brussels, the alliance announced Tuesday an operation to enforce the arms embargo against Libya. But it went no further on deciding if or when NATO would take command of the mission already under way, in which several allies are participating. In a statement, NATO only said that it had plans on the table to enforce the no-fly zone ""if needed."" The backdrop was a simmering feud between France and Italy that turned more cynical by the hour. Italy is demanding that NATO take a lead role in the military and political decision-making during the remainder of the Libyan mission. But resistance within the alliance mounted even as the United States expressed its desire to take a back seat in the operation and hand over any command role to European allies. France seemed most reluctant to submit to NATO command, but Germany and Turkey also voiced objections. These countries also argue that Arab League nations would be shut out of any decision-making if NATO took control. German Foreign Minister Guido Westerwelle said he continues to believe it was right not to participate in the United Nations-sanctioned mission. He noted that Germany is not alone in its skeptical view of military action, pointing to the fact that other European nations are not taking part either. Westerwelle also refused to comment on whether NATO should take a leading role in enforcing U.N. resolution 1973. ""That is for the coalition of the willing to debate,"" Westerwelle said. French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe told French media that NATO would play a role in the mission in coming days but that France, Britain and a council of other coalition partners would make political decisions. One NATO official described this to CNN as putting the alliance's assets at the disposal of the coalition, but NATO would have no formal political role. The squabbling continued as Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattini again threatened to take back complete control of Italian airbases if NATO did not take the reins of the mission. ""Who, if not NATO, can take on this task?"" said Frattini in comments to Italian media. Some Italian politicians sought to settle old colonial scores by cynically noting that if France was allowed to lead this mission, it would get all the Libyan oil contracts and Italy would get all the Libyan refugees. On a busy day at the Gioia Del Colle Air Base in southern Italy, RAF Typhoons executed a number of sorties to enforce the no-fly zone in Libya. ""The Italian support is crucial,"" said Royal Air Force Commander, Group Captain Sammy Sampson, but added that his fighters could operate from other locations. ""It's a decision for our headquarters and our political masters."" Discussions between NATO allies will continue this week as the alliance continues to disagree over the parameters and scope of the U.N. resolution that authorized all means necessary to protect civilians in Libya, as well as imposing a no-fly zone over the country. As well as disagreeing over whether Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi is a legitimate target, there is the question of whether Libya will split along tribal lines or whether a united Libya is even a possibility. There is no appetite among coalition allies to get involved in a tribal grudge match or civil war. Turkey, also a NATO member, also voiced its opposition to a political role for the alliance and has forcefully suggested that the mission so far has already gone beyond the intention of the U.N. resolution to protect civilians. However, one NATO source told CNN that they did not see Turkey's objections so far as a major stumbling block to a further role for NATO.","European allies argue over future of mission against Libya .

"(CNN) -- Chinese dissident artist Ai Weiwei lost his second and final appeal against tax evasion charges in a Beijing intermediate court Thursday, leaving him liable for back taxes and fines totaling RMB 15.52 million (US$ 2.4 million). The court directly ruled on the case without holding a hearing and failed to serve Ai sufficient notice of the ruling, according to Liu Xiaoyuan, Ai's legal adviser, who accompanied the artist to court on Thursday. ""We submitted new evidence to the court after the first appeal,"" Liu said. ""According to regulations, there should have been another hearing, but there was not."" ""According to relevant laws and regulations, the court should send a formal written notification three days before the verdict,"" Liu added. ""But the court just gave us a call last night telling us there would be a hearing today,"" he said, adding that no other members of Ai's legal team were able to make it to the court on such short notice. ""I'm more aware than ever now that I'm just as vulnerable as most other ordinary people in this country,"" Ai said, saying that he was ""exhausted."" ""We knew from the beginning that this was going to be a losing battle - to fight as individuals against the legal system,"" he said. ""But to see so much arbitrary conduct in almost every step of their work is still very frustrating."" ""We've been making a lot of effort getting our evidence, documenting our company's financial activities. And the court didn't really show any hard evidence today to convict us. They're openly violating the law by infringing on tax payers' basic rights and ignoring lawful requests time and time again."" Requests by CNN for comment from the court have not been returned. Ai Weiwei paints bleak picture of the future . Ai was barred from attending the court hearings held in June and July for his original lawsuit, with tens of police cars parked outside his home, studio, and the court. Liu said the artist was allowed to attend Thursday's hearing, likely because the case can no longer be appealed. The 55-year-old provocateur has been battling the tax evasion charges brought by the Beijing tax bureau against his artistic company, Fake Cultural Development Ltd., for over a year. The outspoken artist, blogger, filmmaker, and architect was on his way to Hong Kong in April 2011 when he was taken into custody at Beijing's international airport and detained for 81 days amid a government crackdown on political activists. Ai's studio in Beijing was raided, and his wife and several employees were taken into custody for questioning. The government campaign was attributed to fears of a potential Arab-Spring-style uprising, following online calls for a ""Jasmine Revolution."" Seven weeks after Ai was taken into custody, state news agency Xinhua reported that Beijing police said his company evaded a ""huge amount of taxes"" and ""intentionally destroyed accounting documents."" He was released on one year's probation the following June, with heavy restrictions imposed on his movements. Ai was forbidden to speak to the media or post on his Twitter account about his detainment. His phone was tapped, his e-mails were checked, and he had to report his appointments with other people to the police. Ai Weiwei places himself under home surveillance . In November, the authorities demanded he pay the back taxes and fines within two weeks. Tens of thousands of supporters donated more than RMB 9 million (US$ 1 million) to help him, some even throwing RMB 100 notes folded into paper airplanes over the gate of his house. Ai used the donations to post a payment guarantee of the invoice in order to file a lawsuit to protest the charges.

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Sharon Stone's former maid filed a wrongful termination lawsuit against the actress on Monday, contending Stone fired her because she was injured carrying groceries. Angelica Castillo's complaint, filed in Los Angeles County Superior Court, comes less than a year after Stone's former nanny sued accusing her of violating labor laws and and making derogatory comments about her ethnicity. The suit says Castillo suffered severe pain when she hurt her back while carrying Stone's groceries in June. Although a doctor ordered her not to lift heavy objects and to get bed rest, Stone told her to return to work, the complaint said. ""Plaintiff was required to perform her regular duties, including but not limited to grocery shopping, lifting and moving heavy items as part of cleaning the residences,"" the complaint said. ""While the plaintiff was still in severe pain, Stone repeatedly yelled at plaintiff for performing her duties more slowly, and called her 'crazy' and 'stupid,' "" the suit said. Stone fired her the same day, the lawsuit said. The complaint accuses Stone of wrongful termination and failure to provide accommodation for her injury. The lawyer for the actress did not immediately respond to CNN requests for comment. The former nanny's lawsuit, filed in May, said she was fired because she refused to return overtime pay that Stone told her she did not deserve. Stone told her she learned from her accountant in January 2011 that she was paying the nanny overtime when she worked holidays or traveled to care for her three children, the suit said. Erlinda Elemen, a Filipino, worked as a live-in nanny for the actress for more than four years until she was fired in February 2011, the lawsuit said. Stone called it ""an absurd lawsuit"" with ""made-up and fabricated"" claims, filed by ""a disgruntled ex-employee who is obviously looking to get money any way she can.""","Lawsuit claims Sharon Stone called the maid crazy and stupid .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Sharon Stone's former nanny filed a lawsuit Wednesday accusing the actress of violating labor laws and making derogatory comments about her ethnicity. Stone called it ""an absurd lawsuit"" with ""made-up and fabricated"" claims, filed by ""a disgruntled ex-employee who is obviously looking to get money any way she can."" Erlinda Elemen, who is Filipino, worked as a live-in nanny for the actress for more than four years, until she was fired in February 2011, the lawsuit filed in Los Angeles County Superior Court Wednesday said. Elemen claims she was fired because she refused to give back overtime pay that Stone told her she did not deserve. Stone told her it was only in January 2011 that she learned from her accountant that she was paying her overtime when she worked holidays or traveled to care for her three children, the suit said. ""Defendant Stone, however, accused Plaintiff of 'stealing' from her by taking the above-described overtime pay, told Plaintiff that it was 'illegal' for Plaintiff to have taken the pay, and asked for it back,"" the court filing said. Elemen refused to give the overtime pay back, arguing it was required by state and federal labor laws, the suit said. ""Defendant Stone then began to repeatedly berate Plaintiff in front of her staff, guests and others, for a period of approximately three weeks, for no other reason than Plaintiff had received overtime pay as hereinabove alleged,"" it said. The nanny was fired ""shortly thereafter,"" the lawsuit said. The suit claims the nanny was ""repeatedly subjected to numerous derogatory comments and slurs by Stone related to her Filipino ethnicity and heritage"" during the last six months of her employment. The alleged derogatory comments including criticism about the nanny's Filipino accent. ""She was told not to speak to the children because Stone did not want her children to 'talk like you,'"" the suit said. ""In addition, Stone made comments which equated being Filipino with being stupid."" The lawsuit also charged that Stone was ""repeatedly verbally dismissive of Elemen's deeply held religious beliefs, criticized Elemen for frequently attending church and, on one occasion, even forbade her live in nanny from reading the bible in Stone's house."" Elemen sought and was given approval from the California Department of Fair Employment and Housing to sue Stone for an unspecified sum for unpaid wages, damages and penalties, the suit said. ""After she was terminated approximately one-and-a-half years ago, she filed claims for alleged disability and workers compensation,"" Stone said in a statement to CNN. ""Now, she is obviously looking for another opportunity to cash in."" She insisted she would be completely vindicated in court. ""This is a frivolous lawsuit for absurd claims that are made-up and fabricated,"" Stone said.

"(CNN) -- A Black Hawk helicopter crashed Thursday in southern Afghanistan, likely killing all four of its crew members -- all of them Americans -- a U.S. military official said. The crash occurred in bad weather, though the official said, ""We cannot yet rule out enemy action."" Troops at a combat outpost in the area waiting to be picked up saw the crash happen, the official said. Another helicopter flying nearby was not affected. Fatal helicopter crashes involving members of the NATO-led International Security Assistance Force are not unprecedented in Afghanistan, with some of the aircraft brought down by enemy fire while others crashed for mechanical reasons. The single deadliest loss for U.S. troops since the Afghan war began in late 2001 happened in August, when 30 U.S. service members died when a helicopter carrying them went down while they were reinforcing other troops, officials said. Seven Afghan troops died in that same crash. A U.S. military official said then that insurgents were believed to have shot down the CH-47 Chinook. The Taliban claimed that militants downed the helicopter with a rocket-propelled grenade. More recently, 12 people died last month when a helicopter crashed last month in Afghanistan's capital city of Kabul. Capt. David Yaryar, an ISAF spokesman, said there was no reported ""insurgent activity in the area"" at the time.","A Black Hawk helicopter crashes in Afghanistan, a U.S. military official says .

"(CNN) -- iReporters Kathleen Fitzgerald and Lizzy Showman are students at the School of Visual Arts in New York City. As part of a class project, they were challenged to see if they could touch someone's life using their design skills. Both commute by bus, so they decided to thank the bus drivers of the M15 route by giving them specially designed seat cushions. On November 18, 2011, Fitzgerald and Showman handed out over 50 cushions, and Jeremiah Fabre captured the reaction. The team felt the project was a success and proof that small gesture can make a big impact. Fitzgerald and Showman shared their experience in this Impact Q&A by responding to CNN questions jointly over e-mail. iReport: Giving back to the NYC Bus Drivers . CNN: How did it start? Fitzgerald and Showman: This project was inspired and curated through Stefan Sagmeister's class ""Can Design Touch Someone's Heart?"" Our target audience was a group of people we did not know. After spending a few months together in our first year at The School of Visuals Arts, Kathleen and I found we both commute via the M15 bus line to school every day. The M15 is one of the busiest bus routes in North America, serving over 16.5 million commuters a year. The life of a bus driver is not always easy, making them our target market for this specific assignment. CNN: Describe what you did. Fitzgerald and Showman: The life of a M15 bus driver can go unnoticed at times, but a thank you is a start towards a better appreciation for their efforts and hard work. As graduate design students at The School of Visual Arts, we wanted to express our gratitude by creating custom designed butt cushions to help soften the ride for M15 bus drivers. We also invited customers and bus drivers alike to visit our social network site dedicated to the M15 line where people can share their thank yous and stories about their local bus commutes. CNN: Why is it important? Fitzgerald and Showman: This project is important because it extends a thank you to a group of people that is often unnoticed and under-gratified. This project also inspires others to extend a simple thank you or even repeat something similar. Our hopes in this project are to inspire other cities to do a similar project, creating a network and a strong social response. CNN: How are you making an impact? Fitzgerald and Showman: We have had great response and feedback from the community through our blog and on other sites like CNN's iReport. We believe it is giving people a second chance to thank their bus driver or other type of service workers. We are in the process of further extending this project out to the entire line of the M15 drivers (over 400 drivers), and future NYC bus lines. Find us on Kickstarter in the coming weeks to give us a helping hand. CNN: Why should other people get involved? Fitzgerald and Showman: We believe that by extending appreciation and gratitude to people that serve our community, it in turn helps create a better environment for us all. The bus community has relished in our recent attempt to create awareness and appreciation throughout, and we are determined and confident that by doing so, more commuters and cities will take a moment to share a thank you. What are you doing to Impact Your World? We want to hear your story about how you or someone you know is making a difference in the lives of others.

"(CNN) -- At the start of the evening dinner rush on January 10, a group of 13 is seated at an Applebee's in Mason City, Iowa. Their waitress is new. She is nervous. She has never served a big group before but after a little reassurance she is ready. The 13 men and women, ages 25-60, are dressed in flight suits from University of Iowa AirCare. They have just attended a memorial service for three colleagues killed in a medical helicopter crash on January 2 and have stopped for dinner before the long drive home. Dr. Azeem Ahmed, medical director of the University of Iowa AirCare program, said the deaths had hit the Northern Iowa emergency responder community hard. Russ Piehl and Shelly Lair-Langenbau, along with pilot Gene Grell, were killed just minutes after climbing into a Mercy Medical Center North helicopter to pick up a patient. Although the cause of the crash is not known, the Des Moines Register reports the helicopter hit the ground and burst into flames just 15 miles away from the hospital from where it had been dispatched. Radio Iowa said Grell was looking forward to being a ""husband in the near future."" The paper described paramedic Piehl as a dedicated professional with a sense of humor. Nurse Lair-Langenbau was described by WHOtv.com as a ""hell of a nurse"" and dedicated mother to her two young daughters. More than 1,000 people including emergency responders, members of the public and family attended the service. ""It was somber, but uplifting,"" Ahmed said. ""It helped us all with the healing process."" As the group finished their meals their waitress told Ahmed their bill will be ""very small."" ""What do you mean?"" Ahmed asked. The waitress handed the doctor a folder. Inside was a note on a napkin, written in capital letters. ""For all you do and in memory of your team mates ... This meal is on us."" Ahmed said after reading the note he stood up and addressed the group, explaining what had just happened. Then he passed it around. Some had tears in their eyes. ""We were very moved and humbled,"" said Ahmed. ""We were overwhelmed."" Jennifer Allen, Applebee's associate manager, said the entire staff was overwhelmed, ""in a good way.""On the drive home Ahmed said the conversation naturally gravitated toward the note. Each person, Ahmed said, committed to paying the good deed forward. Ahmed posted a photo of the note and a short caption to his Facebook page and on the Facebook page for University of Iowa AirCare. It received more than 2,000 shares, 12,000 likes and 500 comments.When asked why he shared it he said there were three reasons. First, he wanted to recognize the person, who wished to remain anonymous, in some way for her or his kindness. Second, he wanted to let emergency responders know what they do makes a difference and for them to feel the same support. Third, he wanted to honor those who died by motivating others to pay it forward. ""It's motivation for myself and everyone who sees it to do something similar,"" Ahmed said. ""In the end, the people who died, this is the best way to honor them.""","Stranger pays entire bill for AirCare team .

"(CNN) -- Chinese dissident artist Ai Weiwei may not be allowed to leave his native China, but his art is free to travel the globe, and some of it is now on display in Washington. ""Ai Weiwei: According to What?"" marks the first North American exhibition of Ai's work. His art sprawls around an entire floor in the Smithsonian Institution's Hirshhorn Museum. The outspoken artist, blogger, filmmaker and architect is perhaps best known for helping design the famous ""Bird's Nest"" Olympic stadium for the 2008 Summer Games in Beijing. Some of the artwork on display includes photos taken of the stadium while under construction. Ai later said he regretted his work on it because instead of the venue becoming a place for all, it became a place for the elite. Ai was on his way to Hong Kong in April 2011 when he was taken into custody at Beijing's international airport and detained for 81 days amid a government crackdown on political activists. His studio in Beijing was raided, and his wife and several employees were taken into custody for questioning. Seven weeks after Ai was taken into custody, state news agency Xinhua reported that Beijing police said his company evaded a ""huge amount of taxes"" and ""intentionally destroyed accounting documents."" Ai Weiwei loses tax evasion appeal . ""My detention was an extreme condition for any human to endure. Many, including my family and the people who know me and care about the incident, were frustrated by the lack of an explanation or reason,"" Ai said in a statement to the museum. ""Going through these events allowed me to rethink my art and the activities necessary for an artist,"" he said. Ai was released on one year's probation in June 2011, with heavy restrictions imposed on his movements. The Chinese government still holds his passport. Ai's criticism of the Chinese government gained attention following the 2008 Sichuan earthquake that left nearly 90,000 people dead or missing. Many of the victims were students who died when their poorly constructed schools collapsed on them. Ai has compiled a list of more than 5,000 of those students. Part of the list is on display at the museum, accompanied by audio of people reading the names of the students. Ai Weiwei will not be silenced . Ai also has a work called ""Snake Ceiling"" on display, made of hundreds of backpacks latched together in the shape of a snake. These are meant to represent children's backpacks left behind after the earthquake. Ai said he saw numerous piles of backpacks outside schools when he traveled to Sichuan following the disaster. Some of the works take a personal tone, with pictures of Ai at a hospital following surgery to relieve pressure on his brain following what he said was from a beating by Chinese police. A medical scan shows the damage caused to his skull and brain. The exhibit will be on display at the Hirshhorn through February before it moves on to other venues in the United States and Canada. And having this work on the doorstep of policy-makers certainly isn't lost on museum officials. ""Ai Weiwei's art and his activism resonate far beyond the art world and encourage an expanded dialogue on crucial social, cultural, and political issues of the day,"" said Hirshhorn Museum Director Richard Koshalek in a catalogue detailing the exhibit. Ai Weiwei paints bleak picture of his and China's future . Despite the personal toll his work has taken on him, Ai said the struggle has been worth it. ""The struggle is worthwhile if it provides new ways to communicate with people and society,"" Ai said. CNN's Alexis Lai contributed to this report.","Dissident artist Ai Weiwei's work is now in Washington at the Hirshhorn Museum .

"(CNN) -- On my first visit to Italy, at the age of 18, I fell in love with the country and its amazing history almost at first sight, as I and my friends sailed across the lagoon on the ferry to Venice. When we returned and found our camper van had been emptied out by thieves, I felt a little less enamored, to say the least. This was my first glimpse of the split personality of a country that is expressed nearly 40 years later in the title of my 2012 book, ""Good Italy, Bad Italy,"" and is the theme of the new film I have just narrated for the Italian director Annalisa Piras, ""Girlfriend in a Coma"". Yet what I didn't realize then, as a (fairly) innocent teenager, was quite how significant Italy's history is for the whole of the West. The greatest case study, or cautionary tale, comes from Venice itself. In medieval times La Serenissima, as Venice is known, became the richest and most powerful city-state in the Mediterranean. It was run by a quasi-democratic ""grand council"", made up of the merchants who were making the city rich, an elite that was open to newcomers if they had new ideas and new energies. But in the 14th century the elite decided to close its doors to newcomers, allowing in only those related by family to the old guard, and nationalizing trading rights. The decline of Venice began with that decision. Italy today is like a huge re-run of that sad Venetian story. During the 1950s and 1960s, the country was Europe's own ""emerging economy"" of the period, enjoying the third fastest average annual GDP growth rate in the world during those decades, beaten only by Japan and South Korea. It was helped by the global move towards freer trade and by the early European Union, but also by its own then very dynamic society and economy. New, entrepreneurial companies were formed, new ideas blossomed; Italy became a pioneering center for design, for cinema, and for fashion, and the migration of millions of workers from the poor south to the industrializing north provided the factories with labor at a competitive price. But then old demons came back to haunt Italy. The sharp polarization, combined with fear, between left and right that was a legacy of the fascist period of Mussolini from 1917 to 1943, returned first in the form of a huge wave of strikes in the late 1960s and early 1970s, and then in a deadly form of political violence. Nearly 500 people died in shootings, bombings and other tragedies during the decade and a half from 1970 as extremists on both left and right fought a running battle. As well, sadly, as taking part in the violence, governments responded by trying to buy social peace -- first by implementing a very restrictive labor law which had the effect of making the law courts the principal arbitrator in industrial disputes; and second by an explosion of public spending (and thus borrowing) chiefly on pensions and a national health system. Public pensions became the main form of unemployment insurance, as unwanted workers were permitted to retire early and draw pensions. But public debt became the main albatross around Italy's neck as governments ran budget deficits that in 1975-95 averaged (yes, averaged) almost 10% of GDP each and every year. The result: a pioneering crisis of sovereign debt and a foretaste of the crises now roiling the eurozone, as Italy's debt load reached 120% of GDP in the early 1990s and sent the country into near bankruptcy. That financial crisis, in the course of which the Italian lira was ejected from Europe's pre-euro exchange-rate system (along with Britain's pound sterling) coincided with a huge political crisis, as corruption investigations brought crashing down the parties that had dominated Italian politics for the past 40 years. The crisis brought talk of a new start, a ""second republic"" (to succeed the first, formed with the postwar constitution in 1945-48) and even a renaissance. In the interim, governments led by so-called technocrats (a professor, a governor of the Bank of Italy, an ex-diplomat) were brought in to make reforms and give the country a much needed ""reset"" before normal politics would be resumed. It didn't happen. Hence, 20 years later, Italy finds itself in yet another crisis, one that looks eerily similar. The country's sovereign debt is -- you guessed it -- 120% of GDP. A mix of financial crisis and scandals brought down the long-running government of the media billionaire Silvio Berlusconi, while also discrediting establishment politicians of all parties. In November 2011 a technocrat, the economics professor and former European Commissioner Mario Monti, was brought in to stabilize the country's finances, make reforms and give the country a ""reset"" before normal politics commence again after the upcoming elections. It is too soon to say that the ""reset"" -- or, to use a broader metaphor, the upgrading of Italy's cultural, political and economic software -- will fail again. But it can be said that progress has been slow and disappointing. Prime Minister Monti succeeded in stabilizing the public finances, but at the cost of a deeper recession than in all other eurozone economies except Greece and Spain. Beyond that, however, no major reforms have been implemented -- so the justice system remains painfully slow, the labor laws still discourage hiring while leaving millions of young people on poorly paid temporary contracts, competition remains overly restricted, too many markets are over-regulated, meritocracy remains stunted, corruption remains rife, and the huge cost of politics and political privileges has been left unchanged. These tasks all remain for whichever coalition succeeds in forming a government after the elections. They should, however, have been done during the previous 20 years. Some progress in liberalizing markets was made, but not enough to stop Italy's GDP growth rate during 2001-10 from being the 180th worst in the world, just ahead of Haiti's. Why not? Resistance from entrenched interest groups has been strong. Berlusconi's entry into politics in 1994 was essentially designed to obstruct change, to preserve his quasi-monopolistic businesses, and to ensure the old political ways could continue. On the left, suspicion of capitalism has remained rife, trade union powers have been maintained more successfully than in Germany or even France, and the use of political patronage to build power networks and reward supporters has helped destroy meritocracy. The big question, however, is why Italians have allowed this to happen. The answer in our film, ""Girlfriend in a Coma"", is taken from Italy's, and arguably Europe's, greatest ever poet: Dante Alighieri. In his ""Divine Comedy"" of the 14th century, the sin he condemned most vigorously was ""ignavia,"" by which he meant sloth -- the failure to take responsibility, the failure to show moral courage and to change things. That is the coma that filmmaker Annalisa Piras and I diagnose as the Italian condition: economic stagnation, yes, but also a failure of consciousness and responsibility, which is in effect a moral failure. Umberto Eco, the philosopher and novelist, adds a further explanation in the film. Italians, he says, ""do not have a sense of the state."" They had and respected a very powerful state in Roman times but that collapsed. The only states that have successfully replaced it since then have been the city states of Venice, Florence and elsewhere, which produced great riches and even the Renaissance of art, science, humanism and culture of the 15th century, but never achieved a set of stable, respected, still-less national institutions. To get Italy out of its coma, its second crisis of 20 years, new governments will have to work hard to fix that problem. To make sure they do so, Italians will need to shed their ignavia and to become more active and demanding -- not in their sectional or local interests, but in the national interest.","Bill Emmott: ""Good Italy and Bad Italy"" represent spit personalities of troubled country .

"(CNN) -- Hilton Botha, the former lead detective in the Oscar Pistorius murder case, cited ""private reasons"" for resigning from the police force, South African Police spokesman Brig. Neville Malila said Thursday. Botha was pulled from the Pistorius case last month after prosecutors reinstated attempted murder charges against him in a 2011 case. The 22-year South African Police veteran is accused of chasing and firing on a minibus full of people while drunk. He is charged with seven counts of attempted murder. Opinion: Not everyone surprised at Oscar Pistorius' fall from grace . Pistorius, the 26-year-old double amputee track star, is accused in the killing of his girlfriend, Reeva Steenkamp, 29, last month. Botha, the first officer on the scene of the Valentine's Day shooting, handed in his resignation Wednesday, Malila said. ""We are not going into the reasons,"" Malila said. ""He has indicated to us it is for private reasons."" His removal from the high-profile murder case came just days after his testimony at a bail hearing for Pistorius that included admissions that police could have contaminated the crime scene and failed to properly catalog evidence. The sprinter said in an affidavit that he thought an intruder was hiding in a toilet room inside the bathroom of his Pretoria home. He fired into the room in a fit of terror before realizing the person inside was Steenkamp, Pistorius said. During the three-day bail hearing, held in a dark, stuffy Pretoria courtroom, defense attorney Barry Roux hammered away at the credibility of Botha and the entire police investigation. Opinion: Pistorius case brings South Africa gun culture to spotlight . He argued that police had missed a bullet in the toilet of the bathroom where Steenkamp was shot and may have contaminated the crime scene by failing to wear protective foot covers. Botha told Roux that investigators didn't wear the booties because they'd run out. Bulelwa Makeke, the spokeswoman for South Africa's National Prosecuting Authority, said before the announcement of Botha's removal that the accusations against the investigator would be little more than a ""speed bump"" in the Pistorius case. The attempted murder charges against Botha had previously been withdrawn for additional investigation, but prosecutors decided last month to proceed, South African Police Service Commissioner Riah Phiyega said. Phiyega praised Botha, saying he is an experienced investigator who ""has presented the case of the police well."" Botha was replaced by the department's most senior detective, Vinesh Moonoo, in a move Phiyega said positioned the department for a ""long-haul"" investigation of Steenkamp's killing.

"Beijing, China (CNN) -- For thousands of years, China has seen itself as the Middle Kingdom, the center of the universe -- a view that shapes China's understanding of the world and contributes to an indifferent attitude toward other countries. The world may be watching the U.S. election, but China isn't concerned with who wins. And many here believe America has lost the credibility it once had on the world stage. Unlike the 1960s or '70s, when America had a more convincing claim as the moral arbiter of the world, many Chinese officials now believe the United States is only concerned with its own economic gain. Map: World weighs in on U.S. election . In China there is little understanding of American society, or its politics. People stand on the sidelines of the Republican vs. Democrat debate; they don't pick up on the nuances of the discussion, and they can't tell the difference between the parties' positions. The mainstream Chinese media aren't reporting on the U.S. elections, nor are mainstream websites, which is exactly how the Chinese government wants it. In fact, media coverage at all regarding the United States rarely strays from local or regional events and their relations to China, like the current dispute between Tokyo and Beijing over the Diaoyu Islands. Chinese intellectuals, and indeed the public at large, believe that no matter who wins the race, America will have to be soft in its approach to our country because there is so much at stake. Postcard: How Hong Kongers see U.S. election . As for the candidates, people know Obama as a personality, but few could tell you what his government has accomplished in the last four years -- and Mitt Romney remains a complete unknown. For all the tough talk about China during the presidential debates, Romney and Obama evaded any mention of China's suspect human rights record, corruption, and rule of law. By not tackling these controversial topics, the candidates are protecting a strategic partnership with China at the expense of essential human values and beliefs. Personally, I think Obama seems more reliable than his opponent, even though I'm disappointed with his stance on China's human rights record. And although his administration has done very little to further rights here, I still wish him luck on Election Day. Postcard: Is Obama still Kenya's favorite son? While the Chinese people desire democracy, they are skeptical of the U.S. system because its elections don't seem to engender progress for Americans. Democracy is a societal practice, and elections are only a part of it. The U.S. elections are certainly an exercise in democracy, but wealthy individuals and corporations can now pour significant amounts of money and advertising into manipulating the public. The campaigns are mere showcases, extravagant yet empty -- and the time, money and energy spent on the grand spectacle could have been used to solve specific problems for Americans. Postcard: Nigerians enjoy election soap opera . Regardless, Americans should still be proud. It is essential for politicians and leaders to have open discussions about their policies, character, and beliefs. It is the key to public trust and understanding in an open society. I don't think people like the way the debates and elections are designed, but at least they're an outlet for people to make a stand. In contrast, all major decisions in China are made behind closed doors. Here the public knows very little about who their politicians are, the decisions they have made and what they believe in. In a world that demands social change, this approach cannot survive forever. Recently I tweeted: ""Judging from recent events, China has not met the requirements that constitute a country. There is no consensus on recognized elders, no clear set of values, no independent state military, no full citizenship, no international respect, no transparency for leaders' whereabouts, no clear borders, no equal access to defense attorneys, no proper administration of justice, no taxpayer rights... As a country, China is missing all the qualities it needs to call itself a country. China is merely a faulty conjecture."" Postcard: Obama finds support among Chavistas . The one-party system in China is inhuman. It stands against the weight of civilization. It rejects the foundations of modern living, humanity and individualism. The Beijing Olympics and the Shanghai World Expo show just how much effort China is willing to spend to enter the global stage. But while China desires to understand the world, it fails to accept its universal values. China and the U.S. are two societies with very different attitudes towards opinion and criticism. In China, I am constantly under surveillance. Even my slightest, most innocuous move can -- and often is -- censored by Chinese authorities. Recently I danced in a video spoof of the song ""Gangnam Style,"" and it was quickly banned across multiple Chinese online video platforms. But the story still traveled all over the world, carried in hundreds of international media reports. Postcard: Drug war being ignored in U.S. election? That sort of censorship wouldn't happen in the U.S. -- but even though America's government allows its critics to speak out, it is difficult to create any real impact in a country where a vast number of voices are at risk of being drowned out by others. In other words, regardless of your location, social background or political system, it is never easy to speak up against authorities -- it requires a lot of skill and persistence. It is impossible to compare Chinese society with the U.S., as each system has its own dangers. But as the world's two great superpowers, the upcoming U.S. election and Chinese leadership reshuffle demonstrate two different extremes in handling shifts in political power. Postcard: Why Berliners, U.S. are kindred spirits . The people in both nations share a sense of hopelessness; they feel empowered and disappointed at the same time but on different matters. No matter the country or system, it's clear that the relationship between the masses and their leaders must be transformed. It won't be easy, and there will be constant challenges ahead, but it can be done.

"(CNN) -- The final election results are in for the 19th Knesset in Israel, and the only thing that's clear is Israeli voters are pretty evenly divided across the political spectrum. The newspaper Haaretz and the independent U.S.-based Israel Project each projected the seats won based on the vote totals, and they agreed that right wing and center-right parties are likely to end up with 61 of the legislative seats, while left wing and center-left parties, including Arab parties, will probably garner 59 seats. While the totals are ""final,"" now that votes from soldiers, diplomats, prisoners and others have been tallied, they won't be ""official"" until January 30. The results came as a surprise to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his Likud-Beitenu party. Netanyahu's supporters had 42 seats in the outgoing Knesset, but he is projected to retain only 31 in the new legislature. The prime minister indicated Wednesday that he might try to attract centrists into a government coalition rather than form a hard-right bloc in Israel's politically diverse parliament. He announced a focus on three issues dear to the upstart center-left Yesh Atid party, which is projected to capture 19 Knesset seats: increasing equality in the burden on the public, seen as a reference to the practice, unpopular among secularists, of giving military exemptions to the ultra-Orthodox; the grinding issue of affordable housing; and changing what many see as Israel's ""ineffective"" system of government. CNN's Joe Sterling contributed to this report .","Israel's election results are final, but not yet official .

"(CNN) -- The editor of the New Yorker on Monday said he has no regrets about running a cover illustration that portrays Barack Obama in Muslim garb and wife Michelle Obama as a gun-toting militant, despite widespread criticism of the image. The New Yorker cover published Sunday shows Barack and Michelle Obama with a flag burning in the fireplace. Obama's campaign has sharply criticized the publication's latest cover, which appears to portray the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee and his wife as terrorist enemies of the United States. The cover, published Sunday, shows Obama in the Oval Office dressed in traditional Muslim attire. His wife, Michelle, wears an Afro hairstyle and has a machine gun slung over her back. An American flag can be seen burning in the fireplace, and a picture of Osama bin Laden hangs on the wall. ""The New Yorker may think, as one of their staff explained to us, that their cover is a satirical lampoon of the caricature Sen. Obama's right-wing critics have tried to create,"" Obama spokesman Bill Burton said in a statement. ""But most readers will see it as tasteless and offensive. And we agree."" David Remnick, the longtime editor of the highly-regarded publication, told CNN's ""The Situation Room"" that he believes the ironic intent of the illustration will be clear to most Americans. ""The idea is to attack lies and misconceptions and distortions about the Obamas and their background and their politics. We've heard all of this nonsense about how they're supposedly insufficiently patriotic or soft on terrorism,"" the The New Yorker editor said. ""That somehow the fist bump is something that it's not. And we try to put all of these images in one cover, and to satirize and shine a really harsh light on something that could be incredibly damaging.""    Watch talk show hosts discuss the cover Â» . On Sunday evening Obama campaign spokesman Bill Burton called it ""tasteless and offensive."" Sen. John McCain said Monday it is ""totally inappropriate."" Obama refused to comment on the illustration Sunday. Obama supporter and Los Angeles City Councilman Bernard Parks Sr. on Monday called for a boycott of the magazine.  Parks is a Democratic superdelegate from California. ""I think it's outrageous that we'd have a cover that would depict racism, sexism, anti-religion, also anti-patriotism, and then on top of it to try to draw a conclusion that Mr. Obama has some sympathy toward terrorism,"" Parks told CNN. But Remnick, who has approved several provocative covers in the past -- including a recent illustration of Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad appearing to solicit gay sex in a bathroom -- says he isn't concerned Americans will misunderstand the illustration. ""I think you underestimate the intelligence of the American people, to be quite honest. Yes, there will be some people who will misunderstand it, not get it at first,"" he said. ""But here we are on television, discussing something that's been a kind of subterranean theme in American politics, which is disgusting -- these lies about Barack Obama, about Michelle Obama. ""And so in fact we're not even satirizing the Obamas, we're satirizing these rumors, the lies that have fed into the politics of fear."" Remnick also defended his publication's use of satire in general, likening it to the work of popular television hosts Jon Stewart and Stephen Colbert. ""If there's no possibility for satire, if you always have to look for the joke that every -- absolutely everyone will get, you won't have Jon Stewart, you won't have Stephen Colbert,"" he said. ""Stephen Colbert goes on and mocks right-wing commentary by pretending to be a right-wing commentary. In a way this is Colbert in print."" And not everyone finds the illustration over the top. ""Do you really believe that if you see this ... cover, you're going to say to yourself, 'Oh, this is Barack and Michelle'?"" conservative radio talk-show host Shelley Wynter asked. ""This is satire.  Anybody that looks at a drawing of a cartoon and wants to say, 'This is what my presidential candidate is going to be like' is already ridiculous and shouldn't be voting."" The cover is linked to a feature article about Obama's formative political years in Chicago. Liberal radio talk-show host Laura Flanders told CNN's ""American Morning"" on Monday. ""I think the Obama campaign made a misstep here. They should have come out strongly endorsing this cover."" iReport.com: Satire or slander? Share your thoughts . She said, ""This isn't a jab at them, terrorist or any other kind.  This is a jab at the media. ... It should be cause for our conversation to focus on the kind of fear mongering that the media and people on the right have engaged in."" Conservative talk-show host Joe Pagliarulo agreed. ""I think this could be a very positive thing for the Obama campaign,"" Pagliarulo said. ""I think they've got to embrace this and say 'Look, there are rumors out there.' I talk to people every day, like Laura does.  People really do believe ... that he's a Muslim.  They believe he was sworn in on the Quran.  They believe that his wife is unpatriotic and so is he."" Conservative talk-show host and CNN contributor Bill Bennett said he understands why the Obama campaign is upset with the cover. ""The New Yorker blew this,"" he said. ""It has a distinguished history and great writing. I read The New Yorker occasionally. But it was tasteless and stupid. The intellectuals missed it ... and it backfired on them. If I were the Obama campaign, I would be furious at these people."" But Democratic strategist and CNN contributor James Carville defended the magazine's cover choice as satire in its ""ultimate form."" ""I don't know what the big deal is,"" he said. A Newsweek poll released Friday showed that 12 percent of those polled believed Obama was sworn in as a U.S. senator on a Quran, and 26 percent believed that he was raised as a Muslim. Neither is true.","NEW: New Yorker editor defends cover as satire .

"(CNN) -- You can sign up today to receive free credit monitoring services from the credit bureau TransUnion due to a settlement the company reached on a class-action lawsuit. The credit monitoring service offered by TransUnion is worth $59.75, according to the settlement. Your credit score is the magic number that lenders use to determine what interest rate you will get on a loan. Want to see your  score for free, anytime you wish? How about free 24-hour credit monitoring services for up to a year? You may be eligible for these services if you had an open line of credit from January 1, 1987 until May 28, 2008. That means if you received a car loan, opened a department store credit card or took out a student loan in the past 21 years, you'll qualify. This credit monitoring service will give you unlimited access to your credit report and your TransUnion credit score. You'll also get a notice by e-mail if there have been any significant changes to your credit report, like delinquent accounts or if someone tries to open an account in your name. There are two kinds of service that you can choose: . Basic service: This would provide six months of the credit monitoring service with unlimited access to your TransUnion credit report and TransUnion credit score. According to the settlement, this has a retail value of $59.75. If you select this service, you'll also be able to apply for a cash payment from the settlement fund. Enhanced service: This would provide nine months of credit monitoring services, plus a mortgage simulator service. This simulator lets you see what your mortgage rate would be based on your credit score. The service also includes access to your insurance score. This is the score that some insurance companies use to determine your rate. This option is valued at about $115.50. If you select this option, you will not be eligible for a cash payment. But some experts say the value of this benefit is limited. ""The score you're being shown isn't your FICO score,"" says credit expert John Ulzheimer. And the FICO score, established by Fair Isaac, is the score that most lenders look at when extending credit. The difference between your TransUnion credit score, called TransRisk, and your FICO score won't be drastic. But, there could be a difference of 40-50 points, says Ulzheimer. Another problem is that there aren't many lenders who use this credit score, says Ulzheimer. In fact, he speculates that less than 5 percent of lenders will use it. ""Small lenders like credit unions or local banks may look at this score,"" he says. There are simulated credit scores that you can get for free without having to give away personal information. Check out bankrate.com or credit.com. And of course, you can get your credit report from all three credit bureaus for free every year at AnnualCreditReport.com. The value in this kind of offering is that you can get an estimate of your credit standing. Consumer advocates are concerned this could cause confusion. ""I expect there are lots of people under the impression that they have excellent credit [who] get shocked when they get a car loan for much more than those with truly excellent credit would receive,"" says Joe Ridout of Consumer Action, a nonprofit consumer advocacy organization. However, consumers will benefit from having their credit monitored for free. ""TransUnion has a reputable monitoring service,"" says Ulzheimer. Sometimes consumers will like the experience of being updated on their credit report. Other consumers will just shrug. In the end, it's nice to have free three months of anything. The deal ends a class-action lawsuit that was filed after TransUnion sold customer information in the form of marketing lists to other businesses. The company says it discontinued that practice in 2001. TransUnion denied any wrongdoing. Under the terms of the agreement, the company will set up a $75 million fund to spread the word about the settlement and to pay attorneys and other claims. You can file your claim beginning June 16. Go to the Web site at www.listclassaction.com. You can also call the TransUnion settlement number at (866) 416-3470.","You can now apply to get free credit monitoring services for a short period .

"(CNN) -- Cardinals from around the world gathered in Michelangelo's masterpiece the Sistine Chapel this week for a conclave to elect a new pope. The historic process is filled with pomp and ceremony and so shrouded in secrecy that its very name means ""under lock and key."" But it's a curious idiosyncrasy that, in an era when one of Benedict's XVI's final acts was to send a message via Twitter -- and his predecessor ordered that the Sistine Chapel be swept for recording devices -- the conclave's election of Pope Francis was announced on Wednesday evening by white smoke from burning ballot papers. Black fumes earlier signified an inconclusive vote. And until the official announcement of ""Habemus Papam -- we have a new pope"" -- was made around an hour later, it was a modest little stove and chimney that stole the show. The Vatican says the cast iron stove is ""cylindrical in shape with a narrower upper portion"" and approximately one meter high. ""It has a door in its lower section enabling ignition, a valve for manual regulation of the draft and an upper door through which the documents to be burnt are introduced. The dates of election to the papacy and the names of the last six pontiffs are stamped on the upper cap of the stove."" CNN's senior Vatican analyst John Allen said the ""oldish-looking"" stove and its attached chimney were introduced to preserve the independence of the conclave process. ""The whole purpose of the secrecy is to protect the cardinals from outside influence,"" he said, the theory being that details of the ballot papers could expose the cardinals to repercussions or other pressures. The Vatican's constitution requires a two-thirds majority to elect a new pope. On the first day of the conclave, one voting session is held: on other days the cardinals vote twice in the morning and twice in the afternoon. If a second ballot must be taken immediately, the first bundle of ballots and any private notes are burned with the second. The cardinals chosen to be scrutineers are responsible for burning the ballots, with help from the secretary of the College of Cardinals and masters of ceremonies, who are allowed to enter the chapel after voting has concluded. Depending on how long the cardinals take to agree, pilgrims gathered in St. Peter's Square could be reading smoke signals for days on end. And those signals haven't always been particularly clear. Read more: How is a new pope elected? Frederic Baumgartner, professor of history at Virginia Tech University and author of ""Behind Locked Doors: A History of the Papal Elections,"" said that before the 1800s, ""beginning to unbar doors and window was taken as a symbol that the election was complete. There was also mention of noise from where the cardinals were locked in and the firing of cannons at Castel Sant' Angelo."" In the 19th century, Baumgartner said, there was mention of smoke being ""taken as meaning that there had been no election - and that they were burning the ballots after scrutiny. The smoke was described often as yellow. What I get from the sources that I was reading from the 1800s is that when they didn't see smoke then they were hopeful."" But the first reference to the different meanings of white or black smoke occurred at the 1903 conclave. ""The primary reason they went for the black and white smoke was because there was confusion in the crowds as to what was going on,"" Baumgartner explained. But the confusion didn't stop there. Interactive: Selecting a pope . Priest and archivist Fr. Nicholas Schofield said that in the event of an inconclusive ballot, wet straw had traditionally been added to the fire to make the smoke black. But uncertainty around the results of a 1958 conclave had led to the introduction of chemicals to make the color of the smoke more obvious. Nonetheless, CNN's senior Vatican analyst, John Allen, said smoke from the fire ""normally comes out an indistinct grey at the start."" At the 1978 conclave that resulted in the election of Pope John Paul II there were some false alarms and John Paul II later specified that the bells of St. Peters be rung to signify a successful election. ""The problem with that is that bells go off at the Vatican all the time."" At Pope Benedict XVI's election in 2005, Allen recalled, bells had rung out at the same time as smoke came from the Sistine Chapel chimney, but it transpired that they were just marking the top of the hour. The confusion occurred despite the introduction that year of an auxiliary smoke-emitting device aimed at improving the visibility of the smoke. ""In order to improve the draft, the vent is preheated by means of electric resistance and it's equipped with a ventilator for use if necessary,"" the Vatican said in a statement. Ahead of this year's conclave, spokesman Father Federico Lombardi said the chemical technique had been improved to ensure a clear color signal. Once the senior cardinal deacon appears on the balcony overlooking St. Peter's Square to formally announce the election of a new pope and his name, the little stove's time in the spotlight should be over and the focus will then move to the pope elect. ""He's supposed to act as if it's a difficult decision and then he has to be fitted with his vestments,"" Baumgartner said, estimating the appearance might come about an hour after the smoke signal. ""If a man was really conflicted about the job, he may take a little longer."" Baumgartner said that he was not aware of any wrong announcements about a new pope being made in modern times - but there had been some in the past. ""There used to be a tradition that the Romans [residents of Rome] would go and ransack the dwelling of the cardinal that was elected -- on the grounds that he didn't need it anymore. There was at least one example of the Rome's residents ransacking the house of the wrong cardinal, during the 400-500 years the tradition was followed. ""Not only did he not become pope but he didn't have anything left in his house.""

"(CNN) -- After three days of chaos, drama and an unknown number of deaths, Algerian special forces troops were holding their fire Saturday in the hostage crisis at a gas facility in the nation's remote eastern desert. Survivors described harrowing escapes from Islamic militants who attacked the site early Wednesday. Some invented disguises, others sneaked to safety with locals, and at least one ran for his life with plastic explosives strapped around his neck. Read more: Power struggle: The North African gas industry targeted by militants . Six Americans were freed or escaped, a U.S. official told CNN. The official provided no other information about their status or whereabouts. Other Americans were unaccounted for. Earlier Friday, State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland said there were still American hostages. Yet others didn't make it -- either because they were killed or were still being held. Algerian troops staged a military offensive that some nations criticized as endangering the lives of the hostages. On Friday evening, they were trying a different tack, the state-run Algerian Press Service reported. ""The special forces ... are still seeking a peaceful settlement before neutralizing the terrorist group currently entrenched in the refinery, and free a group of hostages who are still detained,"" it said. It was not clear how many hostages were seized by the Islamist militants and how many were being held. Thursday's military operation ended with 650 hostages -- including 100 foreigners -- freed, while at least 12 Algerian and foreign workers were killed, the Algerian Press Service reported in what it said was a ""provisional toll."" In addition, 18 of the attackers were ""neutralized,"" APS said. The dead include one American, identified as Frederick Buttaccio, Nuland said, as well as one French and a Briton. At least 30 foreign workers were unaccounted for, according to the official media report. British Prime Minister David Cameron said Friday that significantly fewer than 30 of his countrymen remained hostage. There could be as few as three Americans still being held, two U.S. officials said earlier this week. The fate of eight workers with Norway's Statoil, some of them Norwegians, was unclear, the company said. The same was true for the 14 Japanese unaccounted for, Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga told reporters in Tokyo. And Malaysia's state-run news agency, citing its foreign ministry, reported Thursday two of its citizens were held captive. A spokesman for Moktar Belmoktar, a veteran jihadist who leads the Brigade of the Masked Ones -- a militant group associated with al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb -- reportedly offered to free U.S. hostages in exchange for two prisoners. The prisoners are Sheikh Omar Abdel Rahman, who orchestrated the 1993 World Trade Center bombing, and Aafia Siddiqui, a Pakistani woman jailed in the United States on terrorism charges, the spokesman said in an interview with a private Mauritanian news agency. Asked Friday about the offer, State Department spokeswoman Nuland rejected it, restating U.S. policy of not negotiating with terrorists. Opinion: Algeria situation is a wake-up call for the U.S. ""This is an act of terror,"" U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said Friday. ""The terrorists ... are the ones who have assaulted this facility (and took) hostage Algerians and others (from) around the world who were going about their daily business."" A dangerous escape . The incident began when the militants -- apparently angry about Algeria's support in a rout of their comrades in neighboring Mali -- targeted the gas field, which is operated by Algeria's state oil company in partnership with foreign companies. At the start of the siege, the militants gathered the Westerners into a group and tied them up, survivors said. The kidnappers were equipped with AK-47 rifles and put explosive-laden vests on some hostages, a U.S. State Department official said. Some escaped by disguising themselves, according to Regis Arnoux, who runs a catering firm at the site and had spoken with some of his 150 employees who were freed. He said they all were traumatized. Some Algerian hostages were free to walk around the site but not to leave, Arnoux said. Still, a number of them escaped, he said. As the Algerian military launched its operation Thursday, the militants moved some hostages, according to one survivor's account. With plastic explosives strapped around their necks, these captives were blindfolded and gagged before being loaded into five Jeeps, according to the brother of former hostage Stephen McFaul. McFaul, with the explosives still around his neck, escaped after the vehicle he was in -- one of several targeted by Algerian fighters -- crashed, his brother said from Belfast, Northern Ireland. ""I haven't seen my mother move as fast in all my life, and my mother smile as much, hugging each other,"" Brian McFaul said upon his family hearing his brother was safe. ""... You couldn't describe the feeling."" McFaul said the other four Jeeps were ""wiped out"" in an explosion, and his brother believed the hostages inside did not survive. Nations mobilize to help citizens caught up in crisis . U.S. Defense Secretary Leon Panetta, speaking in London, said the United States was working round the clock to ensure the safe return of its citizens. Those freed include some Americans, while other U.S. nationals were unaccounted for, U.S. officials said. The United States was evacuating 10 to 20 people caught up in the crisis, a U.S. defense official told CNN on Friday. They were to be taken to U.S. facilities in Europe, where their condition would be assessed, the official said. Britain has sent trauma experts and consular affairs officers who can issue emergency passports to a location about 450 kilometers (280 miles) away from the plant, a Foreign Office official said, so they'll be ""as close"" as possible to the scene. BP, which helps operate the gas field, said Friday that a ""small number of BP employees"" were unaccounted for. The same held for some workers with Statoil, though nine others with the company -- including five who escaped -- were safe. Four Norwegians and a Canadian with that oil firm were in an airport hotel in Bergen, Norway, after being taken from Algeria, Statoil spokeswoman Sissel Rinde said. Both BP and Statoil -- two of the foreign companies with In Amenas operations -- were pulling their personnel out of Algeria, which is Africa's largest natural gas producer and a major supplier of natural gas to Europe. BP said it had flown 11 of its employees and several hundred staffers from other companies out of the North African country Thursday and was planning another flight Friday. Mark Cobb, a Texan who has a LinkedIn profile identifying him as general manager for a BP joint venture out of In Amenas, said he had escaped on the first day and was safe. A U.S. military C-130 plane flew 12 people who were wounded in the ordeal out of Algeria on Friday, a U.S. defense official said. None of them were Americans, though efforts continue to evacuate freed Americans. Three workers for a Japanese engineering company that was working on the site have been contacted and are safe, said Takeshi Endo, a senior manager for JGC Corp. But the company had not been able to contact 14 others, he said. France's foreign ministry said that, in addition to one death, three of its citizens were rescued. Japan 'terribly disappointed' in Algerian military operation . Algeria faces tough questions from governments of the kidnapped nationals over its handling of the crisis. Neither the United States nor Britain, for instance, was told in advance about Algeria's military operation Thursday. Japanese Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga said his nation's officials had urged Algeria's government to avoid exposing hostages to danger. ""We are terribly disappointed about the Algerians' military operation,"" Suga said. Japanese Vice Minister Shunichi Suzuki summoned Algeria's ambassador Friday to express Tokyo's concern. U.S. officials made a similar plea to the Algerians, urging them to be cautious and make the hostages' safety their priority, an official in President Barack Obama's administration said. A senior U.S. official said American officials did not trust information they got from the Algerians, ""because we hear one thing and then we hear something else."" But Algeria acted out of a sense of urgency after noticing hostages being moved toward ""a neighboring country,"" where kidnappers could use them ""as a means of blackmail with criminal intent,"" Communications Minister Mohamed Said told state television. Algerian troops fired on at least two SUVs trying to leave the facility, Algerian radio said. And a reporter saw clashes near the site, according to the Algerian Press Service and radio reports. ""There were a number of dead and injured, we don't have a final figure,"" the communications minister said of casualties after the operation. Belmoktar, the man behind the group claiming responsibility for the attack and kidnappings, is known for seizing hostages. French counterterrorism forces have long targeted Belmoktar, an Algerian who lost an eye fighting in Afghanistan in his teens. Libyan sources said he spent several months in Libya in 2011, exploring cooperation with local jihadist groups and securing weapons. The militants said they carried out the operation because Algeria allowed French forces to use its airspace in attacking Islamist militants in Mali. Media in the region reported the attackers issued a statement demanding an end to ""brutal aggression on our people in Mali"" and cited ""blatant intervention of the French crusader forces in Mali."" Latest on the Mali situation . French Prime Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault said the Algerian hostage situation ""confirms the gravity of the terrorist threat and the necessity to fight it with a determined and united front."" That sentiment was echoed by Clinton, the top U.S. diplomat. She stressed the need for a concerted, international effort to address terrorist and other threats around Africa. ""It is absolutely essential that, while we work to resolve this particular terrible situation, we continue to broaden and deepen our counterterrorism cooperation,"" she said Friday. ""It is not only cooperation with Algeria, it is international cooperation against a common threat.""

"Washington (CNN) -- Inside an ordinary office building six blocks from the Capitol, investigators sift through evidence of possible violations against ethics and laws committed by the nation's elected representatives. This is the Office of Congressional Ethics, also known as the OCE. It is one of the most important watchdogs in Washington. That's because the OCE is the only quasi-independent government body whose sole mandate is to formally investigate members of Congress. But it could soon be silenced by the very people it investigates. ""What is outrageous about it is that you see members of Congress on both sides saying they have zero tolerance for unethical conduct,"" said Melanie Sloan, a former federal prosecutor who now directs Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW). ""But then behind closed doors they are quietly trying to kill the one body in Congress that is seriously going after unethical members."" Sloan's public interest group monitors ethics and legal violations by members of Congress. And, like many other citizen watchdog groups in Washington, CREW is worried that the OCE could soon die through purposeful inaction by Congress. The ethics office -- which gets its mandate and funding from Congress -- must be reauthorized by this Congress, which soon adjourns, or early on by the new Congress. What's more, at least four of the OCE's board members are approaching the end of their terms, and new members must be selected and appointed for the organization to continue with its work. No investigations or reports or real work can be done by the office until their board is in place. The OCE was formed just four years ago when then-Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi and others declared they wanted to ""drain the swamp"" of scandals and corruption in Washington. Among the biggest scandals that prompted action was that of Jack Abramoff, a former lobbyist, who admitted in 2006 to illegally showering gifts on officials in exchange for favors. The probe into those allegations led to convictions or guilty pleas for 20 lobbyists and public officials -- including a member of the House of Representatives and several aides to congressmen. Other scandals included those tied to former Reps. Tom DeLay, Mark Foley, William Jefferson and Duke Cunningham. Since its creation in 2008, the OCE has launched more than 100 investigations of lawmakers, raising serious questions about possible Congressional misdeeds. In about a third of its investigations, the OCE found that House ethics, and sometimes federal laws, were likely violated. Those 37 cases were referred to the House Ethics Committee for further review. ""The OCE has forced members of Congress to take ethics more seriously,"" said Sloan. ""It has forced the (House) Ethics Committee to act and has let all members of Congress know that they're not going to be able to skate by like they have for so many years, with unethical conduct just going on."" Sloan and her public interest group -- which is considered by some to be a liberal organization -- aren't the only ones worried about the future of the OCE. Ken Boehm, chairman of the conservative National Legal and Policy Center, agrees that some members of Congress publicly support the office and its efforts to crack down on ethics violations, but are privately trying to kill it. If the OCE is not reauthorized and new board members are not appointed, Boehm said it would ""(send) the message to the public that not only is the ethics system broken, but it doesn't even exist anymore."" House Speaker John Boehner and House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi would need to lead the effort to reauthorize the OCE and to appoint new members. Both Boehner and Pelosi say they will do that. ""House Democrats are firmly committed to the continuation of the OCE and replacements will be named at the appropriate time,"" said Pelosi's spokesman, Drew Hammill. Similarly, Boehner ""intends to retain the OCE for the 113th Congress and to appoint an ethics chair in a timely fashion,"" his spokesman, Michael Steel, said this month. But neither Boehner nor Pelosi have made public any more specific actions they have taken. And time for action is quickly running out. The reauthorization should have really been started before this Congress goes on its winter break to allow for the time that it takes to select and appoint new board members. The new Congress is scheduled to be sworn on January 3. In many of its hard-hitting investigations, the OCE has confronted legislators about their actions, raising sensitive questions about possible conflicts of interest, financial reports, missing financial information, and even questions about the legality of some lawmakers' actions. There are other watchdogs for ethics within the Congress -- the House Ethics Committee, and the Senate Select Committee on Ethics. But these internal committees are often criticized for doing almost nothing because they are in the awkward position of investigating their own members and close colleagues. By contrast, the OCE is an outside body, widely seen as being objective. It is made up of experts, including some former members of Congress, who are nominated and approved by Boehner and Pelosi. However, the OCE cannot take disciplinary action against the lawmakers it finds are likely to have violated ethics or federal law -- so it has to refer its most serious investigations to the House Ethics Committee. Out of the 37 cases it received from the OCE, the House Ethics Committee meted out formal punishment only on two occasions. It is hard to know whether the stalled fiscal cliff negotiations have sidetracked any effort to reinstate the office, or if members of Congress might be quietly leading an effort to kill the OCE. Latest on fiscal cliff talks . ""Nearly everything the OCE does rubs the entire Congress the wrong way,"" Sloan said. ""And in large part that's because Congress doesn't want to hold anybody accountable for ethics violations. There's no case that they think, 'Oh this was a great case. We're so glad the OCE brought it.'"" In the past, numerous federal lawmakers from both political parties have voted to cut the OCE's budget or limit its powers, including Reps. Mel Watt, D-North Carolina; Jeb Hensarling, R-Texas; John Campbell, R-California; Yvette Clarke, D-New York; Eliot Engel, D-New York; Sam Graves, R-Missouri; Tom Price, R-Georgia; Laura Richardson, D-California; Bennie Thompson, D-Mississippi; and Joe Wilson, R-South Carolina. None of them would agree to an interview with CNN. The OCE also declined to answer any questions. The lawmakers who did speak to CNN about the OCE said part of the problem is that it casts a wide net. ""They accept anonymous complaints made by anonymous individuals and then have the resources to conduct an investigation which can become a fishing expedition,"" said Rep. Hank Johnson, D-Georgia. Rep. Brad Miller, D-North Carolina said he believes there should be a way for the American public to raise issues about the conduct of their representatives in Washington. But, he added, ""Some of what the OCE has sent to the Ethics Committee was actually really flimsy. I mean, conduct that if you have any idea what the real world is like, you would know was not ethically questionable or if it is, everything that happens in politics is ethically questionable."" And if the accusation is referred to the Ethics Committee, Miller said that's ""like torture"" for lawmakers. ""It's like being charged with a crime,"" he said. Johnson raised a criticism that first surfaced several years ago after the OCE investigated Rep. Charles Rangel and several other members of the Congressional Black Caucus for expenses from an overseas trip to the Caribbean. After those investigations, some representatives in Congress accused the OCE of ""targeting"" African-Americans. ""The Office of Ethics was established for political reasons,"" said Johnson, who is African-American. ""And the victims of it tend to be people who look like me and that's why I'm opposed to it. ""I would rather for us to continue with the same ethics rule and process that was in place before we came to this Office of Ethics. And I don't think it's working well."" All the citizen watchdog groups CNN interviewed -- including CREW, Public Citizen, and the National Legal and Policy Center -- said they do not believe the OCE has targeted any Congressional officials because of their race or any other reason. They all maintain that the OCE has simply investigated cases where concerns of ethics were raised. Whether members of Congress decide to keep the OCE or allow it to dissolve ""is a critical test,"" according to Lee Hamilton, a widely respected former Congressman who chaired the famous 9/11 Commission. ""It is going to tell us whether the leaders of Congress are serious or whether they're not serious about the enforcement of standards of conduct within the institution,"" said Hamilton, who is now the director of the Center on Congress at Indiana University. He said it should surprise anyone that members of Congress don't want to be held accountable for their actions. ""I want to see a tough enforcement of those standards,"" Hamilton said. ""And it bothers me not a whit that some members of Congress get uneasy about it. They should get uneasy about it if they are acting in an unethical way.""

"(Budget Travel) -- If you book hotels online, it's time to face facts: Your favorite travel website probably isn't cutting it. In the past decade, some of the best-known travel sites have lost their fastball. They're not as smart and nimble as the new kids on the Web that now have tools for smarter comparison shopping, searches for smaller B&Bs and niche neighborhoods, and access to blocks of rooms reserved for its members. Before you try these, one word of caution: No single site is the be-all-and-end-of-all of hotel booking. We recommend using at least two search tools, such as your current favorite online travel agency and one of the hotel shopping engines we've named here, to max out your chances of nabbing the perfect room or upgrade. Happy shopping! BackBid . Best for: Travelers who like the idea of hotel owners competing for their business. What it does: Hoteliers often hold back a handful of rooms to sell to last-minute guests, but they don't always fill them. You can book one of these rooms as they're released by logging on to BackBid, which enables hotels to sell rooms to travelers who already have confirmed bookings at rival properties. How it works: Book a refundable reservation at a hotel through your favorite website, and then create a free account at BackBid. Forward the email with your confirmed hotel reservation to the site, and it will shoot your reservation details -- minus your credit card information -- to dozens of hotels at your destination. BackBid will then share with you any counter-offers rival hotels may make, such as a comparable room at a lower rate. DealBase . Best for: Travelers who want an independent source to vouch for the honesty of vacation package prices. What it does: Many hotels tout packages that include perks, such as valet parking and a spa treatment, claiming that the package prices represent deep discounts over buying the components separately. DealBase vets each package for its true value. How it works: Use DealBase to pick a hotel package at your destination, then click on the listing for a breakdown of the estimated costs of the package's components. (The site even publishes a list of the ""worst"" hotel deals.) Budget Travel: 12 elevators you need to see to believe . HotelSweep . Best for: Travelers who prefer staying at independently owned properties. What it does: Founded this year, HotelSweep lists more than 50,000 U.S. hotels, motels, B&Bs, and guesthouses, scraping listings off countless websites. (A British version, hotelsweep.co.uk, does the same thing for lodging in the United Kingdom.) One of the perks of the site is that it lists mom-and-pop properties -- places that generally aim to attract budget-conscious travelers, but are too small to afford the costs of being listed with multinational travel agencies. How it works: Punch your destination into HotelSweep's ""direct hotel search"" tool, and the site will fetch a quick-and-dirty list of properties, which you can sort by nightly rate or distance from a particular location. A Google Street View image of the property is provided, but it's up to you to take the next step and contact the managers and book a room. If that is too much work, HotelSweep also has a ""live price comparison"" tool, which is a standard booking engine powered by HotelsCombined.com, an Australian rival to Kayak, though it doesn't include all of the mom-and-pop listings that turn up in the ""direct hotel search"" tool. Hipmunk . Best for: Culture vultures and nightlife fans who want to stay in the buzziest neighborhoods. What it does: Previously a metasearch site for airfare, Hipmunk last year added hotels to its repertoire. One of its signature tricks is to allow a traveler to name his or her favorite interest, such as nightlife, shopping, and museum-hopping, and the site will filter its listings to only display hotels in neighborhoods with an especially high number of relevant venues, such as bars, boutiques, and museums. How it works: Run a search for a hotel like you would on any travel site, and Hipmunk retrieves real-time rates from booking sites, such as Orbitz, Getaroom, Hotels.com, HotelsCombined, and vacation rental platform Airbnb. Hipmunk also assigns an ""ecstasy"" rating to each hotel, based on an evaluation of the property's rates, amenities, and user reviews on TripAdvisor. Budget Travel: 15 food etiquette rules that might surprise you . Momondo . Best for: Travelers booking hotels overseas who have been disappointed by the selection on U.S.-based travel agencies. What it does: In 2010, Momondo, moved beyond being a flight metasearch engine and now lists hotels from major overseas hotel booking sites, such as Escapio and Hotelopia, which tend to be overlooked by U.S.-based travel sites like Expedia. It also includes an option to search for hostels. How it works: Like Kayak, you enter your search query, and the site draws up a list of rates from various online travel agencies and hotel sites. Room 77 . Best for: Travelers whose priority is a room with the most amenities. What it does: Room 77 is unique in researching room-by-room amenities and floor plans for hundreds of three- to five-star hotels in about 30 North American, European, and Asian cities. It then facilitates booking a particular type of room. How it works: Room 77 works like a typical hotel search engine, only it goes into much greater detail about the amenities available in individual rooms at hotels, such as what the view might be from any given window. Guests who book directly through Room 77 can take advantage of its free ""room concierge"" feature, in which it contacts hotel managers on a guest's behalf to request a room matching his or her preferences, such as ""connecting rooms"" and ""distance from elevators."" There are no guarantees, but the site claims that its customers have a high satisfaction rate with its concierge service. Budget Travel: 21 girl trips you absolutely love . Room Key . Best for: Travelers who prefer the consistency and quality control of U.S.-owned chain hotels, and don't want to be distracted with information about other places. What it does: Seven hotel chains -- Best Western, Choice Hotels (Comfort Inn, Quality Inn), Hilton, Hyatt, InterContinental (Holiday Inn, Crowne Plaza, Hotel Indigo), Marriott, and Wyndham (Howard Johnson, Ramada, Days Inn, Super 8) -- are listing their rooms together in a new search engine. Unlike major online travel agencies like Expedia and Priceline, Room Key limits its selection to chains, eliminating most of the uncertainty about what kind of hotel you might end up with. How it works: Punch in your destination and travel dates and the site brings up a list of relevant hotels, which you can winnow down using the standard tools, such as distance, price, and star rating. When you decide to book, you're sent directly to a hotel owned website, where you'll need to enter your credit card number to book the room. Booking directly with the hotel cuts out the middleman and earns you customer loyalty points. YourRoomKey . Best for: Travelers looking mostly for American business-type hotels. What it does: Finds the cheapest rooms at major-brand hotels located at America's largest airports and financial districts -- and nearly nowhere else. How it works: This consolidator has access to rooms at a volume discount with major brands like Hyatt and Marriott at most major U.S. airports (especially Chicago, Denver, Los Angeles, Philadelphia, San Francisco, and Washington, D.C.). By only allowing members to see deals, the site is able to offer rates much lower than major chains and websites with lowest-price guarantees offered to the general public.

"Washington (CNN) -- President Barack Obama said on Thursday that he will not engage in any ""chest beating"" over Iran's nuclear program, but plans to issue a ""clear and direct"" challenge to Tehran during his upcoming Middle East trip, according to sources familiar with his comments. Obama said at a White House meeting with Jewish American leaders that he will still work toward a diplomatic resolution with Iran over its nuclear program, but repeated that no options are off the table, including military ones, one of the sources said. The comments do not represent a change in the Obama administration's thinking, but come as the president prepares to travel in two weeks to the region where he is expected to be pressed over Iran by the Israeli government. Separately, Obama told the group that he will not unveil his own Mideast peace plan when in Israel, saying such a move would be ""premature,"" the sources said. The sources said Obama told the participants that doesn't mean the United States would not be in the middle of a ""policy initiative"" within the next year. He told the group he was determined for a ""just resolution"" of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict but said he thought that the prospects were ""bleak,"" one participant told CNN. While overseas, Obama will also visit the West Bank and Jordan, the White House said. Obama was pressed at the meeting about why he didn't use tougher rhetoric regarding Iran's nuclear program, which Tehran says is for peaceful purposes but the United States and other allies believe is intended for building a weapon. Obama said he will work toward a diplomatic resolution and that he still intends to achieve one. He said he is not going to do something for ""chest beating"" just to show people he is tough, two sources said. During the trip, Obama will issue what is called a ""clear and direct"" challenge to Iran and that he told the meeting ""no options are off the table, including military options,"" one participant told CNN. Vice President Joe Biden earlier this week forcefully admonished any attempts by Iran to develop nuclear weapons. ""Big nations can't bluff. And presidents of the United States cannot and do not bluff and President Barack Obama is not bluffing,"" Biden told the American Israel Public Affairs Committee in Washington. Obama reminded those at the White House meeting on Thursday that the Iranians are a proud people and to reach any agreement, the United States cannot humiliate them and needs to give them a way to back down. He even quoted an old Chinese proverb about building a ""golden bridge"" for your opponent. During the hour-long session, Obama said he had four aims for the trip: to underscore an iron clad commitment to Israel; to recognize that the bond is even more important with Mideast challenges becoming more prominent in Egypt, Syria and Iran; to directly challenge Iran on its nuclear ambitions and to work toward a just resolution of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Obama indicated that he will criticize some of the past Palestinian moves on the peace process but also said he will challenge both sides not to undercut their opponents because there needs to be two strong players in order to reach a deal. Separately, some of the two dozen people at the meeting had criticized the nomination of Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel when it was made because of past comments and views on Israel. That issue was among those that defined Hagel's politically charged Senate confirmation process. Hagel was not brought up at the session, the sources said. The meeting, meant to preview the Mideast trip, was the first major session with such a large group of Jewish American leaders during Obama's second term. ""The president reiterated America's unshakeable support for Israel and thanked the leaders for (the) role they play in strengthening ties between the two nations. The president noted that the trip is not dedicated to resolving a specific policy issue, but is rather an opportunity to consult with the Israeli government about a broad range of issues -- including Iran, Syria, the situation in the region, and the peace process,"" a White House official told CNN. Those in attendance included representatives of the American Israeli Public Affairs Committee, the Anti-Defamation League, the American Jewish Committee, B'nai B'rith, the Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations, J Street and the National Jewish Democratic Council. Also there were: Harvard law professor Alan Dershowitz, former congressmen Robert Wexler and Mel Levine, former ambassador Ron Lauder, Democratic strategist Steve Rabinowitz and Rabbi Marvin Heir, founder of the Simon Wiesenthal Center, according to one of the sources. CNN's Adam Aigner-Treworgy contributed to this story.","Obama says he will not engage in ""chest beating"" on Iran .

"(CNN) -- A Pennsylvania court has ordered that the juvenile trial of Jordan Brown -- a boy accused of killing his father's pregnant girlfriend three years ago -- be closed, despite a push by several newspapers to allow public access. Brown was 11 in February 2009 when, authorities say, he shot Kenzie Marie Houk, 26, once at point-blank range in her western Pennsylvania farmhouse. She was eight months pregnant at the time. He was initially charged as an adult, facing the prospect of life in prison without parole. But on August 23, 2011, Lawrence County Judge Dominick Motto reversed his earlier ruling so that Brown would instead face a juvenile proceeding. A judge later ordered that these upcoming proceedings must be closed to the public. The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, Pittsburgh Tribune-Review and New Castle News newspapers subsequently filed an appeal, arguing that the public has a constitutional right to access the courts even when juveniles are involved. Pennsylvania's Superior Court issued a 33-page ruling on Wednesday, that was obtained Friday by InSession from CNN's sister network truTV, regarding the appeal. The opinion, written by Judge Jacqueline Shogan, acknowledges that there ""has been some recent tendency to permit publicity (of) juvenile court proceedings on the theory that this will act as a curb to juvenile delinquency."" But the court also expressed concerns that the harm caused by publicizing juvenile proceedings ""may be great."" The order references an effort to maintain Jordan's privacy, finding that ""there is no alternative short of closure of the juvenile court proceedings"" that will do so. ""Closure of the juvenile proceedings, under the constitutional analysis, serves a compelling government interest and ... there is no less restrictive means to serve that interest,"" Shogan wrote in the opinion. Given the high-profile nature of the case, CNN is identifying Brown by name even though he is a juvenile. Investigators say Houk was killed with a bullet fired from a youth model 20-gauge shotgun that belonged to Brown. The pregnant woman's 4-year-old daughter found her in her bed, according to police. The girl alerted landscapers working near the home, who then called authorities. Brown, who was living with his father at the time of the shooting, was subsequently charged with one count each of criminal homicide and homicide of an unborn child. The charges were initially filed in an adult court because, according to Pennsylvania state law, anyone older than 10 who has committed a murder or homicide is automatically tried as an adult. The defense then must present a sufficient case to move a case to juvenile court. At the time, Brown was thought to be the youngest person facing a life sentence without the possibility of parole, according to an Amnesty International statement. InSession's Jessica Thill contributed to this report.","Authorities say Jordan Brown, then 11, shot and kiled his father's pregnant girlfriend in 2009 .

"Rome (CNN) -- Catholic cardinals have met for a second day Tuesday at the Vatican, but have not yet set a timetable for selecting a new pope. A total of 110 out of the 115 cardinal-electors, those younger than 80 who are eligible to elect the pope, are now in Rome, Vatican spokesman the Rev. Federico Lombardi said Tuesday. The five cardinal-electors who have not yet arrived have been in touch with the College of Cardinals, and the Vatican knows when they are coming, he said. He did not say when that would be, however, or give reasons for their delayed arrival. No date has yet been proposed for the conclave to select Pope Benedict XVI's successor, said Lombardi. It is not necessary for all the cardinal-electors to be present for the conclave date to be set, he said, but they do have to be given time to get there. Another Vatican spokesman, the Rev. Thomas Rosica, said: ""There is no desire to rush things but to take this time for discernment and reflection, and that's been evident in the meetings thus far."" The famous Sistine Chapel, where the secretive conclave takes place, was closed to the public at lunchtime Tuesday for preparations and will remain so until further notice, the official Vatican Museums website said. Those cardinals already in Rome met twice Monday, in the morning and in the evening, as they began a series of meetings known as general congregations. The group decided that congregations on Tuesday and Wednesday would take place in the morning only. The general congregations are a key step before the conclave. Cardinals who want to speak in the meetings sign up to do so, and can speak for as long as they want on any topic they want, Lombardi said. So far, 33 cardinals have spoken. There are 148 in the congregations as of Tuesday morning, he said. CNN Radio: Betting on the new pope . According to Italian media reports, discussions Monday focused on an internal investigation into leaks from the Vatican, the outcome of which has so far been seen only by Benedict, and the church's handling of the scandal over child sex abuse by priests. The cardinals also talked about the kind of pope they want to see at the head of the world's 1.2 billion Roman Catholics. 'As long as it takes' U.S. Cardinals Sean O'Malley of Boston and Daniel DiNardo of Galveston-Houston, speaking to reporters after Tuesday's congregation, said the cardinals were in no hurry to set a date for the conclave. ""I think this is the most important decision that some of us will ever make, and we need to give it the time that's necessary,"" O'Malley said. ""We want to have enough time in the general congregations so that when we go into the conclave, it's a time of decision. This is a time of discernment and prayer and reflections."" ""It takes as long as it takes,"" DiNardo said, adding that there were ""plenty of points of view among the cardinals"" about when the conclave should begin. ""No one really wants to rush this if it can't be rushed,"" he said. Both laughed off speculation that they could be elected pope, although some betting agencies rate O'Malley as the most likely American to become pope. O'Malley was asked if he would continue to wear his brown Capuchin robe if he did become pontiff. ""I have worn this uniform for 40 years and I expect to wear it until I die, and that's because I don't expect to be elected pope,"" he said. DiNardo, who lives in Texas, was then asked if he would keep wearing a cowboy hat if he became pope. ""That's an 'Alice in Wonderland' question. We're going down the rabbit hole in terms of my being elected pope,"" he said. Transfer of power . Benedict announced his intention to step down on February 11 and resigned Thursday, becoming the first pope to do so in almost 600 years. The transfer of papal power has almost always happened after the sitting pope has died. Normally, the College of Cardinals is not allowed to select a new pontiff until 15 to 20 days after the office becomes vacant. However, Benedict amended the 500-year-old policy to get a successor into place more rapidly. The cardinals may to be able to do so before March 15, Lombardi has said. What's in a name? Clues to be found in next pope's moniker . This would give the new pontiff more than a week to prepare for the March 24 Palm Sunday celebrations. Some gambling houses are offering odds on who will next lead the Catholic Church. Favorites include the archbishop of Milan, Italy, Cardinal Angelo Scola; Cardinal Tarcisio Bertone of Italy; Cardinal Peter Turkson of Ghana, who would become the first African pontiff since Pope Gelasius I died more than 1,500 years ago; and Cardinal Marc Ouellet of Canada, who would become the first North American pope. While Benedict has no direct involvement in the selection of his successor, his influence will be felt: He appointed 67 of at least 115 cardinals set to make the decision. Wounded 'hearts and minds' One former cardinal who won't participate in the conclave is Keith O'Brien of Scotland, who resigned last month. O'Brien apologized Sunday for sexual impropriety, without specifying any incident. ""To those I have offended, I apologize and ask forgiveness,"" he said in a statement. The Vatican refused to answer questions Monday about whether it would discipline O'Brien. Chinese Catholics pine for open-minded pope to heal rifts . But others did comment. ""It looks as if the incidence of abuse is practically zero right now as far as we can tell, but they are still the victims, and the wound therefore is deep in their hearts and minds very often,"" Cardinal Francis George, archbishop of Chicago, told reporters in Rome. ""As long as it's with them, it's with all of us. And that will last for a long time, so the next pope has to be aware of this."" Philip Tartaglia, the archbishop of Glasgow and apostolic administrator of the Archdiocese of St. Andrews and Edinburgh, will administer O'Brien's archdiocese until a new appointment is made. ""The most stinging charge which has been leveled against us in this matter is hypocrisy, and for obvious reasons,"" Tartaglia said Monday night in a sermon at St. Andrew's Cathedral in Glasgow. ""I think there is little doubt that the credibility and moral authority of the Catholic Church in Scotland has been dealt a serious blow, and we will need to come to terms with that."" Representatives of a support group for abuse victims, Survivors Network of those Abused by Priests, or SNAP, called Monday for the cardinals to elect a new pope who is not a Vatican insider. The group also called for some of the older cardinals to absent themselves from the General Congregations, arguing that some have been accused of complicity in protecting priests accused of sexually abusing children. ""Their peers should push them to stay home, or they should do so voluntarily, the group feels, for the sake of the church and to avoid heaping more pain on wounded victims and betrayed Catholics,"" a statement on SNAP's website said. One of Italy's anti-clerical abuse networks, L'Abuso, petitioned senior Vatican Cardinal Tarcisio Bertone on Monday not to allow the participation in the conclave of an Italian cardinal it alleges helped protect priests who molested minors in the past. Cardinals must vote in person, via paper ballot. Once the process begins, the cardinals aren't allowed to talk with anyone outside of the conclave. They cannot leave until white smoke emerges from the Vatican chimney -- the signal that a new leader has been picked. More than 5,000 journalists are now accredited for the papal conclave, Lombardi said Tuesday. They cover 24 languages, he said. How is a new pope elected? CNN's Richard Allen Green and Hada Messia reported from Rome and Laura Smith-Spark wrote and reported in London. CNN's Mark Morgenstein and Catherine E. Shoichet contributed to this report.","NEW: ""This is the most important decision that some of us will ever make,"" says U.S. cardinal .

"(CNN) -- She ventured where few before her had dared, taking on a decades-long business monopoly and overcoming gender stereotypes to become a major player in her country's lucrative drinks industry. As chief executive of Keroche Breweries, Tabitha Karanja has paved the way for many other female entrepreneurs in Kenya, a country where women are traditionally scarce in the boardrooms, and even rarer in million-dollar startups. Against all odds, the 48-year-old entrepreneur has painstakingly turned the first Kenyan-owned brewery into a lucrative business. In the process, she had to succeed where others had tried and failed in the face of an entrenched monopoly: East African Breweries. ""People thought it was not possible to break the monopoly of the existing company that was there, because it has been there for 80 years,"" says Karanja, who launched her company's first beer product, called Summit, in 2008. ""People thought it was normal for us to have only one company in this country,"" she adds. ""I was too determined and said 'no' -- I have traveled many other parts of the world and I saw there is no country that had only one brewery; people had many choices so I said that I have to go forward and let the people decide."" Read this: ' Why women will change world' Karanja's journey in Kenya's drinks industry started in 1997, when she started a fortified wine business aimed at the lower end of the market. For the next 10 years she came up against big names in Kenya's wine industry, but in 2007, taxes imposed on alcohol manufacturing made it difficult to keep prices low. Karanja says the hikes made her product too expensive for her target customers, forcing her to stop producing fortified wine. But instead of bowing out of the industry, Karanja came up with a new product. ""So there I thought again and said, 'what do we do for this same market?' And that is how we came up with ready-to-drink vodka. We make it ready-mixed to precision for moderate drinking,"" she says. ""Since then the market has always been opening up and has been growing into this new drink."" Read this: The secretary who became king . Today, the company's brand new, state-of-the-art factory produces 10,000 bottles of gin and ready-to-drink vodka, as well as 15,000 bottles of beer, per hour. Although the company only holds about 5% of the country's market share, Karanja says the demand for Keroche's products outweighs the supply. ""Before the end of this year we laid a foundation stone of expanding the brewery to ten-fold of whatever we have now,"" she says. ""The support of the Kenyans has kept me going all this time because I think that without their support it would have been very hard for anybody to continue doing the business,"" adds Karanja. ""If we support one another, we Kenyans, we Africans, we'll be able to do even bigger than what the multinationals can do."" Read this: Africa's power women . Karanja, a mother of four, says that startups are common in Kenya, but few survive the harsh business environment. She adds that it takes too long to start a business in Kenya, giving international competitors an advantage in the marketplace. ""There is a problem because they have not created an enabling environment to do business in this country,"" she says. Read this: 'Give African women a voice' As a successful entrepreneur in a typically male-dominated world, Karanja says the lack of female executives in her country and beyond is rooted in the way girls are often brought up. ""Even for a young girl all she thinks is to get married, get children take care of the husband,"" she says. ""But if our culture can change that -- 'yes, you'll get married, get your children, but also there is something else that you need to do: you need to develop your country in one way or the other. ""Women have always believed that it is men who are supposed to do that ... so for me what we can do is challenge the women to think further and to believe that we can do even better than men."" A model for aspiring young entrepreneurs across Kenya, Karanja's business skills and efforts to liberalize the country's industry were recognized in 2010 with an award from the president of Kenya. ""I felt good, not because of me, but because of our people here,"" she explains. ""I thought it would motivate the people, the Kenyans, and show them that even if you work very hard, struggle, meet all those challenges, at the end of it there'll be somebody who will recognize you.""","Tabitha Karanja is the chief executive of Keroche Breweries .
The company is the first Kenyan-owned beer manufacturer .
Karanja calls for a change in culture to help create more female entrepreneurs ."
"(CNN) -- One of sport's greatest rivalries will be reignited Thursday when Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal go head-to-head in the quarterfinals of the Indian Wells Masters. Seventeen-time grand slam champion Federer and Nadal, a winner of 11 majors, haven't played each other since the semifinals of the 2012 edition of the Miami event, when Federer emerged with a straight-sets win. Switzerland's Federer booked his place in the last eight with a 6-3 6-7(7-4) 7-5 victory over compatriot and former doubles partner Stanislaw Wawrinka, while Spain's Nadal came from behind to beat Latvian Ernests Gulbis 4-6 6-4 7-5. World No. 5 Nadal has the edge over second seed Federer, leading the head-to-head record with 18 wins to Ferderer's 10. Nadal has also emerged victorious from six of the eight grand slam finals the pair have contested. For former world No.1 Nadal, the win over Gulbis represented another step forward in his comeback from a knee injury which sidelined him for seven months. ""To win matches in days like today are more important that ever for me, and I'm very happy about what I did on court,"" the 26-year-old told the ATP World Tour's official website. ""I'm happy about the attitude. With all the problems, I was able to keep being focused and keep winning."" Defending champion Federer is bidding for a record fifth Indian Wells triumph. ""Today it was extremely close again,"" said the 31-year-old. ""OK, I should [have] maybe closed it out in the second set, but he did well to stay in it. ""At the end, I don't know what [got] me through. Maybe it's the experience or maybe [I was] a bit more calm in those moments. I'm not sure. Today I think I was a little lucky to come through it in the end."" Top seed Novak Djokovic extended his unbeaten start to 2013, stretching his winning streak to 16 by defeating American Sam Querrey 6-0 7-6 (8-6) in a match which finished at 1:51 am local time. Despite the defeat, Querrey is certain to usurp John Isner as the U.S.'s top-ranked male tennis player. Next up for six-time grand slam champion Djokovic is France's Jo-Wilfried Tsonga, who came from one set down to beat Canadian Milos Raonic. Third seed Andy Murray, who lost to Djokovic in January's Australian Open final, battled past Argentina's Carlos Berlocq. Britain's Murray twice trailed by a break of serve in the opening set but recovered to record a 7-6 (7-4) 6-4 win. Murray's quarterfinal opponent will be Berlocq's compatriot Juan Martin del Potro after the 2009 U.S. Open winner breezed past veteran German Tommy Haas 6-1 6-2. In the women's draw, second seed Maria Sharapova beat No. 6 Sara Errani in a repeat of the 2012 French Open. It was Sharapova's third successive win over Errani, having also got the better of the Italian at the season-ending WTA Tour Championships. ""I didn't play my best tennis throughout the whole match. Sara had many opportunities to win the first set,"" Russia's Sharapova told the Tour's official website after her 7-6 (8-6) 6-2 quarterfinal success. ""But I stayed strong and tough. Although I wasn't playing at the highest level, I tried to be as consistent as possible and hang in there. Once I got the first set, I got in a better rhythm, which helped me and gave me more confidence."" Sharapova's semifinal opponent will be countrywoman Maria Kirilenko, after the 13th seed upset in-form world No. 8 Petra Kvitova with a 4-6 6-4 6-3 win.","Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal to face each other in the quarterfinals at Indian Wells .

"(CNN) -- A fatal explosion last month in downtown Kansas City, Missouri, was caused by the accidental ignition of natural gas vapors that had accumulated inside a popular restaurant, according to a report from a joint city-federal task force issued Wednesday. An employee for a contractor laying cable hit a 2-inch gas line with an underground boring machine late on the afternoon of February 19. The explosion occurred about an hour later, killing one person and injuring at least 15 others. At that time, authorities did not know what had caused the leaking gas to ignite, according to Rob Hack, chief operating officer of Missouri Gas Energy. Wednesday's report -- from the Kansas City fire and police departments as well as the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives -- answers that question. After the gas line nearby was ruptured, firefighters asked employees at JJ's restaurant ""to put the flames out on the candles, stove and hot water heater"" inside, said the report. When queried after the blast by investigators, the restaurant's manager acknowledged the initial request and said workers ""only put the candles out and turned the stove off, but did not turn out the pilot lights for the stove or hot water heater,"" according to the report. The report also shed light on how one woman, a civilian, died after getting trapped when the restaurant's roof collapsed. At one point, flames extended more than 100 feet from the building's roof. The contractor, Heartland Midwest, did not have a permit for the excavation, Assistant City Manager Patrick Klein said days after the explosion. Authorities were alerted a short time after the gas line was hit. City firefighters responded to the scene but left a short time later after being told by the utility company that everything was under control, Mayor Sly James said. A Missouri Gas Energy employee showed up about 20 minutes after the initial call and, after some initial readings on gas-measuring devices, called for backup, Hack said. The utility's employees then went into businesses asking people to leave and brought in excavating equipment to try to vent the pipe. But while JJ's restaurant closed early due to a natural gas smell, hostess Deidre Estes and other employees weren't in a rush to leave, unaware of the danger they were in. Then, Estes told CNN affiliate KCTV, ""Boom! And everything was black.""","An explosion ripped apart a Kansas City, Missouri, restaurant last month .

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- Japan will never stop its annual hunt for whales, a government minister has reportedly said, amid recent clashes on the high seas between environmental activists and Japanese whaling ships. ""I don't think there will be any kind of an end for whaling by Japan,"" Yoshimasa Hayashi, the Japanese minister for agriculture, forestry and fisheries, said in an interview with the French news service Agence France-Presse on Tuesday. His comments came after a U.S. judge described Sea Shepherd, the conservationist group that has sought to physically block the Japanese whale hunts, as ""pirates."" Arguing that Japan has ""a long tradition and culture of whaling,"" Hayashi, the secretary-general of a pro-whaling group in the governing Liberal Democratic Party, pointed out other countries' eating habits that may not have universal approval. ""In some countries they eat dogs, like Korea. In Australia they eat kangaroos,"" he was cited as saying. ""We don't eat those animals, but we don't stop them from doing that because we understand that's their culture."" The Japanese Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries confirmed that Hayashi gave the interview to AFP on Tuesday, but it declined to comment on the content of the article. Recent clashes . The interview took place the same week that Sea Shepherd and Japanese whaling authorities reported fresh clashes in Antarctic waters, with each side accusing the other of causing dangerous collisions between ships. Japan's Institute of Cetacean Research (ICR) -- which conducts whaling activities under the authority of the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries -- accused Sea Shepherd ships of ""sabotage,"" saying they rammed into a Japanese whaling vessel while it was trying to refuel on Monday. But Sea Shepherd's Australian division countered with a different version of events, saying that the Japanese ship had caused the collisions. No injuries were reported. The two sides had exchanged angry claims about a previous clash last week, all part of drama that plays out each year in the chilly Antarctic waters. Japan annually hunts whales despite a worldwide moratorium, utilizing a loophole in the law that allows for killing the mammals for scientific research. Whale meat is commonly available for consumption in Japan. Environmental groups such as Sea Shepherd face off with the Japanese hunters, an approach that has resulted in collisions of ships, the detaining of activists and smoke bombs fired back and forth between the groups. Legal battles . Sea Shepherd says the Japanese ships have intruded into Australian territorial waters and breached international and Australian law. The Australian government has been one of the most vocal critics of Japanese whaling and is currently pursuing international legal action to try to stop the hunting. But the ICR says its ships' activities are perfectly legal, noting that a U.S. court has banned Sea Shepherd from threatening whaling ships' operations or sailing within 500 yards of them. A U.S. judge in Seattle used strong words in a ruling Monday that overturned a previous decision from a district court that had denied an injunction requested by the ICR and its claims of piracy against Portland-based Sea Shepherd. ""You don't need a peg leg or an eye patch,"" Chief Judge Alex Kozinski of the Ninth Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals said in his opinion. ""When you ram ships; hurl glass containers of acid; drag metal-reinforced ropes in the water to damage propellers and rudders; launch smoke bombs and flares with hooks; and point high-powered lasers at other ships, you are, without a doubt, a pirate, no matter how high-minded you believe your purpose to be,"" the judge said. All of those acts, according to Kozinski, are part of Sea Shepherd's tactics. He said the ICR has a permit issued by Japan under the International Convention for the Regulation of Whaling and noted that ""neither the United States nor Japan recognizes Australia's jurisdiction over any portion of the Southern Ocean.""

"(CNN) -- The mother of a Brooklyn teenager shot and killed by police demanded an investigation Thursday, saying he was ""slaughtered"" and that she wants to know why. Kimani Gray, 16, died over the weekend. His death triggered protests in Flatbush, a community in Brooklyn where distrust of the police runs deep. ""I'm still waiting for Kimani to come home,"" Carol Gray told reporters during an emotional news conference. She wore dark sunglasses and struggled to speak as she recalled picking the color of her son's casket. ""He has a curfew,"" she said. ""Sometimes he's late. Sometimes he's early depending on the night. But whatever time he gets there, I'll be real happy to see him as soon as the bell rings. And for the past couple of days, the bell hasn't rung."" According to police, plainclothes officers were on patrol in their car in Flatbush when they saw a group of men gathered on the street at about 11:30 p.m. Saturday. As the officers got closer, Kimani Gray broke from the group and adjusted his waistband. The teen ""continued to act in a suspicious manner,"" so the officers got out of their unmarked car and tried to get his attention, said a NYPD statement. Kimani Gray then ""turned on them,"" it said, and pointed a .38-caliber revolver at the officers. They fired at the teenager, striking him. The teen died at a hospital, and a loaded .38 was recovered from the scene, the statement said. One officer fired four rounds; another fired seven, according to NYPD Deputy Commissioner Paul Browne. Both are now on administrative duty. The officers were taken to a hospital and treated for what the department described as trauma and tinnitus, a ringing in the ears. Gray said that her son was killed in front of his best friend's house. She described him as a typical teenager, into girls and hanging out with friends. Most people in the city likely don't believe what police say happened Saturday, said Councilman Charles Barron, who appeared with the teen's mother at the news conference. For her part, Carol Gray said she did not think her son had a gun, but added, ""I wasn't there."" ""He is not the public's angel, but he's my angel, and he's my baby, and he was slaughtered and I want to know why,"" she said. By Monday, anger at the shooting boiled over, with a mob of young people interrupting a vigil by running wildly into local businesses, according to an eyewitness. Police said they arrested two people that day. On Tuesday, another protest brought out a mostly calm crowd that returned Wednesday, anticipating that Gray's mother would speak, said iReporter and professional photographer Joel Graham. But the hope for a peaceful crowd faded when about 30 young men showed up across the street from the vigil, he said. ""They were not coming out of the shadow. They were staying in the dark area of the street. You just knew it was going to turn into the cops trying to contain those kids who were obviously gonna go for it,"" Graham said. ""That just stopped the original intention of the night."" Graham began to take photos, watching as kids crossed the street toward the protesters. Community leaders started shouting for everyone to calm down and asked anyone taking pictures to stop so they could talk to the young men and calm things down, the photographer told CNN. ""These kids broke loose and took off. The police were caught off-guard,"" Graham said. ""Those kids really know the streets, and they're spreading out and going down side streets away from the main street."" Next came the sound of breaking glass and rolling trash cans, Graham said, and business owners quickly pulled down their metal store-front security coverings. One officer received a gash to his face while another was pushed off his scooter, police said. Forty-six arrests were made, including two juveniles, with the majority charged with disorderly conduct. On Thursday, Mayor Michael Bloomberg offered condolences to Gray's family and said that more must be done to stop gun violence. ""I can promise you that we will conduct a full and fair investigation,"" he said. ""I understand there's anger in the community, but the ways to get answers is not through violence or law breaking. We cannot tolerate that and we will not tolerate that."" The mayor said, ""there's nothing we can do to undo the tragedy for the family, but we've just got to get guns out of the hands of kids and of the people who should not have them."" Flatbush is a place where many people distrust the police, and gun violence is part of everyday life, some residents say. ""As a black man growing up in Flatbush, you just expect to be harassed by the cops, pulled over, arrested and now just straight up killed,"" said Shanduke McPhatter, a 35-year-old former gang member who works with young men in the neighborhood. ""That's what's happening out here. And kids are doing it to themselves to -- they doing the crime, too -- and you got cops who don't live here coming in here so hard, too hard. That's how we got a situation like Kimani Gray."" The violence over Gray's death will eventually subside, but the intense distrust of police will rear itself again violently soon enough in Flatbush, said Lumumba Akinwole-Bandele, a senior organizer with the NAACP. A Brooklyn resident for 41 years, he and McPhatter told CNN there are big problems to address. ""There are no community centers here,"" McPhatter said. ""That has to change. You have to be here and get involved. ""And for the cops, they just need to take that badge away and talk, talk to us like human beings. We're asking them to do that, and we've gotta open up and talk to them. We have to do our part, too. Otherwise, this is just going to keep happening."" CNN's Mary Snow and Eliott C. McLaughlin contributed to this report.","Carol Gray calls for an investigation into her son's death .

"(CNN) -- Frank Ocean says he'll ""choose sanity"" and let his fight with Chris Brown go. ""No criminal charges. No civil lawsuit,"" Ocean said on his Tumblr page Saturday night. ""As a child, I thought if someone jumped me it would result in me murdering or mutilating a man,"" the post said. ""But as a man i am not a killer. I'm an artist and a modern person. I'll choose sanity."" Authorities are investigating the January 27 brawl, in which Brown is accused of punching an unnamed victim on Santa Monica Boulevard in West Hollywood, the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department said in a statement the following day. Deputies responded to a call of six men fighting over a parking space at a recording studio, according to witnesses. Authorities did not name the man whom witnesses say Brown punched, but Ocean tweeted that it was him. ""(G)ot jumped by chris and a couple guys. lol. i only wish everest was there,"" Ocean wrote that night. ""(C)ut my finger now I can't play w two hands at the grammys."" Everest is Ocean's dog. Ocean also tweeted that he cut his finger and won't be able to play with ""two hands"" at the Grammys. Ocean is nominated for six awards at the February 10 show, including Album of the Year, Record of the Year and Best Urban Contemporary Album, where his competition includes none other than Brown. According to the sheriff's department, the fight ended after the men were separated, and Brown and his camp were gone by the time deputies arrived. CNN reached out to Brown and Ocean for comment soon after the incident, but there was no response. Dust-up is Brown's latest . The dust-up is the latest involving Brown, who has been in the headlines in recent years as much for his involvement in violence as for his performance on stage and in the studios. His many honors include a Grammy last year for Best R&B Album. He was sentenced in August 2009 to serve five years probation and to spend more than 1,400 hours in ""labor-oriented service"" for assaulting his pop star girlfriend, Rihanna. The same day of his sentencing, CNN obtained a probation report for Brown that says the pair were involved in at least two other domestic violence incidents before the February 2009 attack in Hollywood. The two have recently been spending time with each other -- even recording together. Brown has been in two other highly publicized incidents -- one involving fellow musician Drake in New York, and one with writer/comedian Jenny Johnson on Twitter. Brown and Ocean have a history, as well. According to MTV, the two exchanged words in June 2011 on Twitter after Ocean seemed to take offense to Brown comparing him to singer/songwriters such as James Fauntleroy and Kevin Cossum. Ocean reportedly fired back by comparing Brown to Sisqo and Ike Turner. Ocean appears to put an end to the chapters. He ended his Tumblr message saying, ""Forgiveness, albeit difficult, is wisdom.

"(CNN) -- Norwegian Aksel Lund Svindal continued his domination of the men's alpine skiing season with a convincing victory Friday in the men's World Cup super-G at Val Gardena. Svindal, bidding to add to his overall World Cup titles in 2007 and 2009, finished well clear of home pair Matteo Marsaglia and Werner Heel. It was his 19th career World Cup win as he recorded a time 1.07 seconds faster than Marsaglia with Heel a further 0.05 seconds further back. The 29-year-old was adding to super-G and downhill successes at Lake Louise last month. ""Oh yeah!!! Good times in Val Gardena. Podium with two local guys. Couldn't let the Italians have all the fun,"" he tweeted after his latest triumph. ""Racing on the #FisAlpine World Cup tour is a lot of fun at the moment!!!""

Meanwhile in the women's downhill at Val d'Isere, pre-race favorite Lindsey Vonn suffered a spectacular crash early in her run at the French resort. Olympic downhill champion Vonn flew into the safety netting after the third gate, but was able to ski down to the finish after the incident. ""She just got a little bit inside and got a little bit hooked up into the soft snow and unfortunately was into the fence,"" U.S women's ski coach Chip White told CNN.

"(CNN) -- A Washington woman who hid a sedated monkey under her blouse on a flight from Thailand was convicted of violating wildlife laws for smuggling the monkey into the United States, prosecutors said Tuesday. Authorities rescued the monkey from Gypsy Lawson's fake womb. Gypsy Lawson, 28, and her mother, Fran Ogren, 56, were convicted of smuggling and conspiracy to smuggle the monkey in violation of the Endangered Species Act and other federal laws. Lawson hid the young rhesus macaque monkey under a loose-fitting blouse on a flight from Bangkok, Thailand, to Los Angeles, California, International Airport, pretending she was pregnant, the U.S. Attorneys Office for the Eastern District of Washington said. Permits are required to possess rhesus monkeys and many other species of animals. Such permits are granted for research, enhancement and conservation purposes. Additionally, transporting such species into the United States requires a customs declaration. Lawson and Ogren had neither. ""These defendants purposely undertook a course of action which could well have endangered many citizens, as well as the life of the animal in question,"" said U.S. Attorney James McDevitt. iReport.com: What you're doing to save the planet and its endangered species . Rhesus monkeys are known to carry viruses and parasites that can be transmitted to humans, said Paul Chang, a U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service agent. ""This particular animal tested negative,"" he said. Chang said the monkey has been placed with a rescue center for abandoned primates, ""but it could have been living out its life with its family in its native habitat."" Authorities found journals and handwritten notes describing the mother and daughter's attempts to find a monkey small enough to smuggle back to the United States. The journal also described the pair's ""acquisition of a small monkey and their experimenting with different medicines to sedate the monkey for their journey home,"" McDevitt's office said. Authorities also found photographs of Lawson at two airports and on an airplane in which she is wearing loose-fitting clothing and appears to be pregnant. ""The journal confirms that she and her mother smuggled the monkey into the United States by hiding it under her shirt, pretending she was pregnant in order to get past authorities,"" the statement from McDevitt's office said. Co-defendant James Edward Pratt, 34, already has pleaded guilty to misdemeanor charges of possession and transportation of prohibited wildlife. He will be sentenced in January. Sentencing for Lawson and Ogren is scheduled for March 3, 2009. The smuggling conviction carries a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison, a $250,000 fine and up to three years of court supervision after release. The conspiracy charge carries a maximum of five years in prison, a $250,000 fine and up to three years of court supervision after release. Flight itineraries show the pair flew from Spokane, Washington, to Bangkok on November 4-5, 2007, with stops in Seattle, Washington, and Inchon, South Korea.

"(CNN) -- Melissa McCarthy didn't quite come out of nowhere. The actress did seven years of ""Gilmore Girls,"" headlined ""Mike & Molly"" for CBS and played three roles in screenwriter John August's ingenious first feature as director, ""The Nines."" But her supporting turn in ""Bridesmaids"" was a revelation, a powerhouse comic performance that pushed that movie to another level of hilarity. In recent years, perhaps only Zach Galifianakis in ""The Hangover"" has had a comparable impact. McCarthy was lewd and fearless, a woman unashamed of her size and her sexual appetite. How to follow that? There's no question she represents a challenge for Hollywood, not only because the industry still struggles to believe women can carry movies, but also because screen glamour is synonymous with thin. Her first star vehicle, ""Identity Thief,"" is not likely to be remembered as anyone's triumph (it's scoring in the 20-something percentile on the critics' aggregator site Rotten Tomatoes), but at least it does enough to show that McCarthy has what it takes. If she forges a movie career, she could really shake things up. She's not quite flying solo, of course. Jason Bateman has top billing as Sandy Patterson, a financial officer in a big Denver firm. When reports start coming in that he's maxed out his credit card in Florida, Sandy is naturally upset. Turns out McCarthy has stolen his identity and is running up big bills on all his accounts. Oh, and she's missed her court date, which means there's an arrest warrant out in his name. Mustering enough cash to fly down there, Sandy decides to apprehend the imposter himself and escort her back to Colorado so that they can straighten out the mess before he loses his job and his home. She may be a scam artist, but Sandy reckons she looks harmless enough. And that would be his fatal error: If there is one thing McCarthy means to prove, it's surely that one look is not enough, because there is so much more to her than meets the eye. In one of the movie's better running gags, she proves it again and again when she delivers a vicious sucker punch to the throat of anyone foolish enough to threaten her well-being. McCarthy, as Diana (which may or may not be her real name), is not about to give up without a fight. But she's also slippery in more subtle ways, an operator who knows how to manipulate people with the way she looks and how she talks. In some cases that involves playing on their pity -- and on ours, too, as the filmmakers imply that her weight is a symptom of her unhappy life. But McCarthy has the personality to subvert this, because her Diana may be lonely, but she is still more vital, more spontaneous and more fun than Sandy is ever likely to be. In the best, most daring sequence, she picks up a guy in a bar (Eric Stonestreet as Big Chuck) and persuades him back to their motel room to have sex with her in front of her husband, Sandy, who ""likes to watch."" It's all a ploy to make an escape, but the scene pivots -- Big Chuck makes it about emotion, not sex, and she responds to his openness. Then things get physical. McCarthy pulls off these shifts with gusto but also delicacy and, yes, tact. In a sharper movie (and let's shoot for the moon here -- Barbara Stanwyck as the con woman in ""The Lady Eve""), Diana would play Bateman's smug executive for a sucker and take him for everything he's got. But in these recessionary times, even financial officers can be sympathetic underdogs, and instead the film contents itself with puerile cracks about his manhood and undeveloped hints that her bad influence might rub off in a good way. Written by Craig Mazin (""The Hangover Part II"") and directed by Seth Gordon (""Horrible Bosses""), ""Identity Thief"" borrows too much from the likes of ""Midnight Run"" and ""Planes, Trains & Automobiles"" without giving enough back -- especially since ""Due Date"" already went that route quite recently. But even with all its shortcomings and sentimental fudges, there is something about McCarthy's refusal to lie down and play the victim that gives it a comic edge. A blunt edge, to be sure, but an edge all the same.","Melissa McCarthy steals the identity of Jason Bateman's character .

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- Allegations that Chinese hackers infiltrated the computers of two leading U.S. newspapers add to a growing number of cyber attacks on Western companies, governments and foreign-based dissidents that are believed to originate in China, experts say. According to one recent report, one in every three observed computer attacks in the third quarter of 2012 emanated from China. Chinese officials have denied that Beijing has supported any cyber attacks, stressing that hacking is illegal in the country. The New York Times reported Wednesday it had been the target of four months of cyber assaults, which started during an investigation by the newspaper into the wealth reportedly accumulated by relatives of the Chinese premier, Wen Jiabao. The Wall Street Journal said Thursday that its computer systems also had been infiltrated by Chinese hackers. Cyber security experts say the alleged attack on The New York Times appeared to be similar to previously reported attacks that were linked to China. ""To do a spear-phishing attack of this kind is a well-established move in attacks against Google and various U.S. defense contractors from China,"" said Thomas Parenty, a former employee of the U.S. National Security Agency who now advises foreign firms in China on computer security. NYT attack a wake-up call, security experts say . ""You could say the tools are sort of stock-in-trade"" for Chinese hackers, he said. ""Spear-phishing"" is a technique of disguising an email so that it appears to be from a trusted source, luring the victim to open an attachment or link that unleashes malicious software on the computer. Investigators for The Times say they suspect the technique was used by the hackers to break into the newspaper's system where they were able collect passwords of every Times employee and gain access to the personal computers of 53 employees. Security experts who helped the newspaper to counter the attacks accumulated evidence that the hackers used methods ""associated with the Chinese military in the past"" to breach the network, The Times said. Chinese denials . Asked about The Times's allegations on Thursday, a spokesman for the Chinese Foreign Ministry said that ""all such alleged attacks are groundless, irresponsible accusations lacking solid proof or reliable research results."" China has been the victim of cyberattacks and ""has laws and regulations prohibiting such actions,"" the spokesman, Hong Lei, said at a regular news briefing. A separate statement from the Chinese Ministry of National Defense said the country's military ""has never supported any hacker activities."" But data reported by Western companies suggest that even though Chinese authorities say they prohibit hacking, they are struggling to keep it under control. One-third of all observed computer attacks from July through September last year came from China, according to a report last month from Akamai Technologies, an Internet services company. The United States was a distant second, originating 13% of observed attacks, followed by Russia with 4.7%. ""China has been consistently responsible for the largest percentage of observed attacks since (the fourth quarter of) 2011,"" the report said. The most recent report shows a dramatic upswing in incidents from the Asian country. In the second quarter, 16% of observed cyber attacks came from China, the company said. The executive summary of the report didn't specify from which groups or individuals in China the attacks might have come. Google had a very public spat with the Chinese government in 2010 after it claimed China had led a hacking attack against Google, other technology companies, defense corporations and Chinese dissidents. ""In the past they've been pretty much focused on either intellectual properties, such as the hacking of defense companies, or dissidents they want to get at, like the Google Gmail attacks,"" Parenty said. ""In this case, it appears they were trying to be able to get to people who talked to The New York Times -- they could make their lives miserable and send the message: Don't do this. ""They love to instill fear so people self censor or limit what they would say or do with the media,"" he added. Compromised computers . Mandiant, the security firm that led the investigation at The New York Times, says there is good reason for concern in the United States. ""There are thousands of computers compromising the United States at universities, at Mom and Pop shops -- small organizations without a big cyber security program -- and those computers serve as the beachhead to hack blue-chip American companies,"" Kevin Mandia, the chief executive of Mandiant, told CNN. ""The majority of victims, well over 90% of the victims we have responded to, really don't disclose that these attacks occur"" for fear of losing customer trust, Mandia said. ""The folks that perpetrated this intrusion have done it to hundreds of other organizations and usually they are very successful,"" Mandia said. ""What's really unique here is the fact that the victim organization, The New York Times, has decided to share this information with the public, so people can be more aware of the problem -- because it's a very pervasive problem."" Marc Frons, chief information officer of The Times, told CNN that the newspaper believed it had prevented this attack from revealing confidential sources. In the case of the investigation into Wen's family's finances, much of the information came from public records. But Frons said The Times isn't letting its guard down after expelling the hackers.

"(CNN) -- Two days after he was pulled from the bottom of a swimming pool at a Disney resort in Florida, a 13-year-old boy from Missouri has died. Anthony Johnson had been playing in a pool at Disney's Pop Century Resort on Sunday. No lifeguards were on duty at the time; signs were posted warning that swimmers swam at their own risk. Relatives said Anthony was jumping in and out with friends when they noticed him missing, and pulled him out within minutes, according to CNN affiliate WFTV. The boy died Tuesday morning, according to the Orange County Sheriff's Office. Water safety expert: 'Drowning doesn't just happen' ""We are saddened by Anthony Johnson's passing and our hearts go out to his family, friends and loved ones,"" a statement from Disney said. ""We have reached out to his family to offer care and assistance during this difficult time."" William Cybulski, a firefighter who was vacationing from Buffalo, New York, said he helped another vacationing firefighter and a doctor give CPR to the boy. ""You never want to see something like that, especially when you're on vacation, or any child in general no matter where you are,"" Cybulski told CNN affiliate WKMG. Cybulski's girlfriend, Crystal Loschiavo, told the station that she did her best to keep the family calm, and tried to soothe Johnson's brother. ""The little boy was really upset that it was his brother,"" Loschiavo said. ""He kept saying 'this is my only brother, this is my only brother. I don't want anything to happen to him.'""

"(CNN) -- It was a foggy winter's night on the remote Ballymany Stud Farm in Ireland when its head groom Jim Fitzgerald heard a knock at the door. What lurked outside was to spark one of the most extraordinary unsolved kidnappings of the 20th Century. Thirty years ago this week -- on February 8, 1983 -- Fitzgerald was confronted by three masked gunmen. They had come for Shergar -- then the most valuable race horse in the world and the pride of a nation. ""Shergar was the best race horse in the world, owned by the richest man in the world. It was the most sensational sports story of all time,"" racing commentator Derek Thompson told CNN. ""We were staggered. A horse kidnapped? Nothing like this had ever happened before."" The retired champion race horse, owned by billionaire businessman the Aga Khan, was worth a staggering Â£10 million ($16 million) -- around Â£28 million ($44 million) by today's standards. Were Shergar here today, he would be the ninth-most valuable athlete in the world, just ahead of Real Madrid's prized footballer Cristiano Ronaldo on $42.5 million. The five-year-old breeding stallion, who had mated with 35 mares in his first season, was set to be worth millions in the coming years with owners paying up to Â£80,000 ($126,000) for his highly sought-after offspring. This, after all, was the champion colt who two years earlier annihilated the field at Britain's prestigious Epsom Derby, winning by 10 lengths -- the biggest margin in the race's 226-year history. For racing-mad Ireland, Shergar was the darling of a nation in turmoil during the darkest days of ""the Troubles,"" with violence between nationalists and unionists in the north as they vied for political power. The bandits demanded Â£2 million ($3 million) for Shergar and conspiracy theories abounded, with the New Orleans Mafia and the Libya's Colonel Gaddafi linked to the thoroughbred's kidnapping. But the most popular accused culprit remains the Irish Republican Army (IRA), whom the Aga Khan and his syndicate of owners officially blamed for the kidnap, though authorities have never named a suspect. While the IRA, which has disbanded, took responsibility for a number of attacks over the years, it never claimed to have kidnapped Shergar. Back at Ballymany on that fateful night, the stallion with a distinctive white blaze on his face and four white ""socks"" was loaded into a horse box never to be seen again. Father-of-six Fitzgerald was bundled into a car and driven around for hours before being dumped a few miles from home. He was warned not to call the police. Then a series of mismanaged calls ensured almost eight hours elapsed before police were alerted. Hampering their investigation was the clever timing of the kidnapping -- it was the day before Ireland's major Goff's racehorse sale and roads were filled with horse boxes identical to Shergar's. The kidnappers demanded negotiations through three horse racing journalists at the time -- John Oaksey, Peter Campling, and then 32-year-old television presenter Thompson. ""We were taken to the Europa Hotel, whose claim to fame was that it was the most bombed hotel in Europe,"" Thompson said. ""Don't forget, this was 1983 at the height of the 'Troubles' and Belfast was one of the most dangerous cities in the world."" At the hotel, which still had cracked windows from a previous bombing, Thompson got a call from the kidnappers telling him he was being watched from across the road. He was told to go to a deserted farmhouse 30 miles away for negotiations. There, Thompson said he received eight phone calls from the kidnappers over eight hours. Each call lasted around 60 seconds, but the police needed at least 90 seconds to trace the call. ""When the last call came at 1.30 a.m. I managed to keep him talking for one minute and 35 seconds,"" Thompson said. ""I thought, 'That's it, we've got him,' but the police told me 'Sorry Mr. Thompson, the man who does the tracing goes off duty at midnight.' ""That was the best chance we had of catching them and it was gone."" Shergar was owned by a syndicate of 34 people, each with a share worth Â£250,000 ($394,000). The syndicate refused to pay the ransom, fearing it would encourage other kidnappings. ""The following Monday we received a call saying the horse had had an accident and was dead. That was the last time we heard from them,"" Thompson said. Thompson believes the IRA was responsible, pointing to evidence in former member Sean O'Callaghan's 1999 autobiography ""The Informer."" ""Every time I took a call from the kidnapper I used a different code word -- the name of a famous race horse -- so I would know it was the same guy calling back,"" Thompson said. ""But there was always one name I kept to myself, I never told anyone else, and when I read O'Callaghan's book it was there. That really shook me to the core."" Jockey Walter Swinburn, who as a 19-year-old rode Shergar to that historic Epsom Derby win, said the kidnapping had a profound effect on tightening racing industry security. ""Shergar's stable was very impressive but anybody could have walked into it,"" he said. ""Today it's more like a padded cell, they can't afford for the horse to get injured, with CCTV and a large number of grooms."" The thoroughbred has since been immortalized in Ascot's annual Shergar Cup and the 1999 film ""Shergar"" starring Mickey Rourke. Swinburn regrets that Shergar's achievements on the track will always be overshadowed by his dramatic abduction. But the image of him pounding over the hill at Epsom, his seemingly tiny competitors trailing behind, lives on.","Thirty years after ""world's greatest"" race horse was stolen, his legend lives on .

"(CNN) -- New Formula One season, same old story. Triple world champion Sebastian Vettel began his quest for a fourth consecutive drivers' title by putting his Red Bull top of the timesheets in practice ahead of the season-opening Australian Grand Prix. The German's lap of one minute and 25.908 seconds edged out teammate Mark Webber, who was second fastest. ""Overall it was a good day for us,"" the 25-year-old Vettel told the sport's official website. ""After all the mileage of testing, it was fun to be out there -- this circuit doesn't get easier, it's a good challenge."" ""Today was a good day and the balance was good, but we need to be ready for what's coming up."" The nearest challenger to the Red Bull drivers was Mercedes' Nico Rosberg, who continued to show the pace which saw him go faster than any other driver during preseason testing. For Rosberg's teammate, Lewis Hamilton, this weekend will be his first grand prix since ending a 15-year association with McLaren. It wasn't an ideal start to a new chapter in his career for the 2008 world champion, with Hamilton ending the day seventh fastest after sliding off the track during what looked to be a promising lap. ""Overall it was a good day, if perhaps not the smoothest,"" reflected Hamilton. ""I'm happy with where we are and to see Nico in third place on the timesheets shows that we're pretty competitive. ""That's a reflection of a great job that everyone has done at the factory and here at the track. I'm looking forward to the rest of the weekend."" Friday's practice at Albert Park took place in favorable conditions, although wet weather is predicted for qualifying on Saturday. Ferrari's Fernando Alonso, who was sixth fastest, expects conditions to change completely, while he also doubts the Italian team will be able to compete at the front of the grid in Melbourne. ""Our efforts were helped by particularly favourable weather with sunshine and summery temperatures,"" explained the double world champion. ""However, the weather is expected to change completely from tomorrow, with wind, rain and a significant drop in temperature, which could influence Sunday's race. ""I'm not expecting any major surprises here, we already knew we were not the quickest and that was confirmed today. The car responds well, but we know there is still much to do if we want to fight with the very best.""","Sebastian Vettel quickest in practice ahead of Australian Grand Prix .

"(CNN) -- Authorities in western Oklahoma said Tuesday they were responding to a prison riot at the North Fork Correctional Facility, where multiple injuries were reported. A morgue had been set up in a tent outside the prison, according to a witness, though there had been no reports of deaths. More than 20 people, all inmates, were injured in the riot and at least five were flown to area hospitals, according to Julie Heavrin of Air Evac Lifeteam. She said she had no information regarding their conditions. However, Beckham County sheriff spokeswoman Amy Brewer said that just eight inmates were injured. Aerial video of the scene from CNN affiliate KOCO showed armed officials holding prisoners at gunpoint. The riot started shortly before noon and it was not clear what motivated it, said Brewer. She said the Oklahoma Highway Patrol had six crews on the scene and Beckham County sheriff's deputies were assisting. The prison is located in Sayre, about halfway between Oklahoma City and Amarillo, Texas. Ronnie Harold, Sayre's police chief, said his department was providing security for the prison, which can house up to 2,400 inmates. ""We are still at a standstill.

"Miami (CNN) -- A Florida prosecutor told the court she intends to seek the death penalty in a case where a 10-year-old girl was found dead in the back of her father's truck. Carmen and Jorge Barahona, the adopted parents of the girl, Nubia Barahona, have been charged with first-degree murder. In Florida, the prosecution must file a notice at the beginning of the legal proceedings if it plans to seek the death penalty. If that's not done, the state waives the right to seek that sentence later in the case. Monday's first appearance on the charges is just the beginning of the Barahonas' criminal case. As it continues, the prosecutors will make it clear whether the death penalty will be sought. The Barahonas have also been charged with eight counts of aggravated child abuse and eight counts of child neglect. Jorge Barahona is charged with an additional count of mutilation or abuse of a dead body. They pleaded not guilty on Monday. In court, the couple sat apart from each other but next to their individual attorneys. Jorge Barahona was wearing a bulletproof vest that showed his bare arms, and Carmen Barahona was in a bright orange jail-issued outfit. Over the years the couple has been at the center of multiple complaints to Florida's Department of Children and Families, with callers reporting that Nubia and her twin brother were locked in bathrooms for long periods of time or bound with tape, according to testimony given in family court. Nevertheless, the children remained in the Barahona home. This case prompted an independent review of the DCF. The panel recently released ""The Nubia Report,"" recommending changes the agency should make in training and technology. The report says when a call is made to the abuse hotline, ""DCF should work with law enforcement to ensure an appropriate joint response when children are not located quickly."" That change is a result of a phone call to the abuse hotline four days before Nubia's body was found in her father's truck. The call was made by a therapist, saying that the granddaughter of Carmen Barahona told her that the twins were being abused, according to documents released in the case. A DCF investigator went to the house but did not see the children and did not notify the police. The pest control truck that Barahona was driving was found by a road ranger on the side of Interstate 95 in the West Palm Beach area on February 14. Firefighters called to the scene found Barahona and Nubia's brother suffering from burns and a chemical-related illness, said West Palm Beach Police Department spokesman Chase Scott. Hazardous material teams were called in to investigate fumes coming from the vehicle. ""The department of environmental protection went into the rear of the vehicle, moving aside some chemicals and located a body in a bag in the rear of the vehicle,"" said Scott. The body has since been identified by the Palm Beach medical examiner as that of Nubia Barahona. Jorge Barahona did speak to police after he was arrested, according to a probable cause affidavit for the aggravated child abuse charges. The document says that Barahona told police that he drove to West Palm Beach that day ""after he placed his deceased daughter in a plastic bag, which he loaded in the rear of his truck."" When Jorge Barahona and his son were released from the hospital, the father went to jail and the child went to a therapeutic foster home. Jail is where both Jorge and Carmen Barahona will be staying, since they were denied bond, awaiting a resolution of their case.","Prosecutor files notice with the court that death penalty may be sought .

"(CNN) -- The world is waiting on the next pope in more ways than one. Everyone, including the College of Cardinals, is wondering who the next Bishop of Rome and leader of the world's billion Catholics will be. But the world is waiting in another, more urgent sense, because the pope isn't just a spiritual leader to Catholics. His work has a global dimension. As has been true in the past, the next pope will have to provide a moral voice to a range of challenges. An estimated 1.7 billion people live without adequate health care or decent living conditions and more than 1.3 billion live below the measure of extreme poverty. Some 870 million people are chronically malnourished. Jesus identified himself with the poor and the marginalized and all Christians have a responsibility to them. But the pope, as Servant of the Servants of God and Vicar of Christ on Earth, bears a special burden. Currently 75% of the world's population faces growing threats to religious freedom, according to a 2012 report from the Pew Research Center's Forum on Religion and Public Life. The U.S. Confrence of Catholic Bishops says in a recent report that while many religious groups face persecution, Christians are harassed in 111 out of 193 countries. An estimated 150,000 Christians die each year because of their faith. Many others have had to leave their countries because of war, oppression or rapid political change. In Bethlehem, the Christian population has dropped from 80% to 28%. Opinion: What Africans want from next pope . The safety of the entire world is a concern with the rise of fundamentalist Islamist groups in the wake of the Arab Spring and the possible nuclear ambitions of Iran and North Korea. The next pope will also face a changing church, which, while ever ancient, is ever new. Two thirds of the world's Catholics live in Latin America, Africa and Asia. The church is growing the fastest in Africa and Latin America. In the United States, 54% of Catholics born since 1982 are Hispanic. Also, an unprecedented 16% of the U.S. population claims no religious affiliation, a challenge to the faith that calls for urgent renewal. This month in Rome, in view of all these many challenges and heartbreaks, the cardinals have the solemn responsibility to give the world a good shepherd who can guide them to the source of true hope and freedom, which is found in Jesus Christ. This is why viewing the upcoming conclave as a popularity contest is to have everything backward. As with picking a pastor or a diocesan bishop, the starting point must be the needs of the people. In the case of the pope, that happens to be the entire world. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Theodore Edgar McCarrick.","Cardinal McCarrick: The world is waiting on the next pope in more ways than one .

"(CNN) -- On Sunday, 49 decapitated bodies were found on a major highway outside Monterrey, Mexico, which is about 80 miles southwest of the U.S. border. A large banner draped over the corpses had a threatening message from one cartel to another, in an area of Mexico where the Zetas and the Gulf Cartel have been fighting for some time. ""100 percent Zeta"" was painted in black graffiti on a wall at the entrance of a nearby town, indicating Mexico's paramilitary-trained cartel had committed another atrocity on a stunningly large scale. A day after the massacre, banners purportedly signed by the Zetas appeared in various parts of the area, denying they were the killers. Four days later, no information about the victims has been released. It's a mystery who killed them and why. The only thing that's clear is that the people who live near the crime scene seem detached, said Mexico-based journalist Ioan Grillo. He has covered the drug war for more than a decade. That's increasingly how many Mexicans act, he said, an understandable coping mechanism when you live in a country battling a drug war that has killed more than 47,500 people in six years. Opinion: Mexico must look inward . CNN talked with Grillo to get his observations and impressions of what's going on. Parts of this interview have been edited for clarity and length: . CNN: You were in Monterrey and went to the town, Cadereyta Jimenez, near the crime scene. Tell me about that. Grillo: The frightening thing about this incident is the lack of reaction from Mexican society and Mexican authorities. You would expect that for an incident of this scale, that the military would be all over the place. Two days afterward, in the center of [Cadereyta], there were no soldiers I could see. There was cartel graffiti in front of the town hall. All around the town, you see graffiti names of CDG (Cartel del Golfo). It's blatant. And you don't see the authorities around. CNN: The people in Cadereyta, what did they say to you? Grillo: The people I talked to are saying, 'Why is this happening? It doesn't have anything to do with Cadereyta. This has nothing to do with us,' which seems like a rejection of responsibility, a kind of denial. Some psychologists say that repeated exposure to trauma causes denial and apathy, a rejection of what has happened. In Monterrey people are quite numb. Perhaps parts of Mexico feel that collectively. When you had the Monterrey casino fire which killed 52 people in 2011, there was an emotional reaction to that. When 72 migrants were found slain [on a Tamaulipas farm in 2010], there was a reaction. CNN: What does this latest mass killing say about the drug war in the bigger picture? Grillo: I don't think you can say this incident is a turning point. The drug war escalated significantly in 2008 to levels we'd not seen before, and in 2010 to levels we'd not seen before. We've had several more years of horrific atrocities. So this just seems like one more among so many. CNN: What about efforts to identify the bodies? [On Wednesday Mexican authorities said they're asking for DNA samples to help with this.] . Grillo: It has been worryingly slow. I mean, 49 people just disappearing? Don't they have families? Aren't there people out there missing them? There are no reports of mass disappearances. Perhaps they were related to trafficking but maybe they weren't. Were they migrants [victims of previous cartel violence]? We don't know anything about the physicality of the victims. Did they have any tattoos that could help answer those questions? You'd think there'd be some physical space where [the killers] decapitated and dismembered these people. They must have left trails. CNN: Logistically, it's incredible to think about how 49 people were killed and then transported out to a major highway. You said this area where the bodies were found is considered dangerous but what specifically is it like? Grillo: This happened in the Plaza de Cadereyta in an industrial area of Monterrey. The bodies were left directly on a major highway that runs toward Reynosa and the U.S. border. The area has been under dispute between the Zetas and the Gulf Cartel, and it's dangerous for that reason. A lot of journalists are fearful to go to the outskirts of the area. CNN: You went to the crime scene, and you've been to hundreds of other crime scenes covering the drug war. How do police secure crime scenes in Mexico, and in particular, how does one secure a crime scene in which 49 bodies have been decapitated? Grillo: In many cases, Mexican authorities do not secure crime scenes well. You can get close to the bodies in many cases. In this case, the military and the police secured the area and covered it. The first calls came around 2:30 a.m. in the morning Sunday. The press in Monterrey first became aware of it around 4 a.m. Because it's a dangerous place to go and because it was the middle of the night, the press wanted to get five or six vehicles to go there in a convoy because of the danger of driving into a hostile area at night. So by the time the press got there, it was 5 a.m., the area was covered and the road was blocked. Cameramen could not see the corpses or verify information about the corpses. It took until about 9 or 10 p.m. [to process the bodies and remove them] ...The only thing we saw was a video that seems to show the killers, which appears to be authentic. CNN: You're talking about a video posted on the Web that you viewed and you say appears to be authentic. Why do you say that? Grillo: Because if you look at a photograph of a pile of human corpses, [you know when] it looks real. It corresponds to this incident. If you watch the video -- some of it is very dark -- you can see it appears to be authentic. As a journalist, you can't [be] 100 percent or know who put it there [on the Web]. CNN: Mexican President Felipe Calderon belongs to a party called the PAN and was elected in 2006. He declared war on the cartels and sent the military fanning out across the country, and he fired hundreds of corrupt police officers. Some say that his actions fueled the violence with the cartels fighting back harder and more creatively. In July, Mexico will hold a presidential election. Calderon cannot run again because of term limits. The party opposite Calderon's -- the PRI -- could take power. How would the PRI in power change the drug war? Grillo: Unless something extraordinary happens, the PRI are overwhelmingly in front in polls and are going to win. So far, the PRI have signaled some quite positive signs for the drug war by having concrete goals of reducing rates of homicide, kidnapping and extortion. So they are doing something other than having a broad goal of defeating the cartels and reconquering territory. The PRI has said these are the anti-social crimes we want to reduce. It's also possible that the PRI could have a majority in Congress. If that happens you could have a more powerful government that could bring together different police forces. One huge problem in Calderon's administration is that you had different police forces in different states fighting each other rather than working together.","People in town near massacre seemed numb, detached from violence, journalist says .

"(CNN) -- Aside from winning his home state of Georgia and the bordering state of South Carolina, Newt Gingrich has had a lackluster performance in the Republican race. It is about time for Gingrich to step out of the race and endorse Rick Santorum. On Super Tuesday, Gingrich was fourth behind Ron Paul, who almost everyone acknowledges has no chance to win the nomination, in no fewer than four states. He finished respectably in Oklahoma (27%) and Tennessee (23%), but still badly trailed Santorum -- and even Mitt Romney -- in these conservative states where he would have had the best chance to garner support. Since then, Santorum swept the Kansas caucuses. Gingrich is now making a strong effort in two other Deep South states, Alabama and Mississippi, and his staffers are intimating that if he does not do well there he will leave the race. It may be dawning on Gingrich that his chance of winning the GOP nomination is quickly receding and that he needs to think more about the conservative cause and what's best for the Republican Party. Gingrich and Santorum have been competing for many of the same voters. Had Gingrich not been in the race, Santorum would probably have won more contests, including the biggest prize of Ohio, as well as the Michigan primary. It seems fairly certain that without Gingrich, Santorum would now be the clear front-runner and some people would be calling for Romney to depart the race. Santorum has positioned himself not only as the conservative alternative to Romney but the only candidate who can still snatch the nomination from him. Although Romney has been touted for some time as the likely nominee and received many endorsements, he simply has not caught on with a sizable part of the party's base. From the beginning of the campaign season, this has been the case. He won a narrow victory in Ohio and in his home state of Michigan because of moderate Republican voters in urban and suburban areas. Some Republicans believe that Romney is the strongest candidate to run against President Barack Obama because he is most capable of broadening the party's electoral base in the fall. However, Romney can't even broaden his own base within the party. When November comes, it's not so clear that he can win the same urban and suburban voters who have reliably voted Democratic in the past. And if at the same time he fails to gain enough support among the rest of the Republican base, then he certainly won't be able to generate the turnout he needs to win. Moreover, his weakness with the Republican base has been reinforced by questions about his character, including his tendency to give off the impression of Brahmin aloofness, spend lavishly and use negative campaigning. The Republican establishment has encouraged the semi-marginalization of a substantial part of the party's base this year by insistently claiming that only a ""moderate"" can win -- by which it seems to mean someone with an unclear message and unsettled convictions. This sounds like a recipe for defeat. The establishment has not only disconnected itself from the preferences of many of its rank-and-file -- without whom the party surely cannot win -- but it has also shown itself to be oblivious to the historical record. While it has not always been the case, Republican moderates often lose. Just think of Wendell Willkie, Thomas Dewey (twice), Gerald Ford, George H. W. Bush (his re-election bid), Bob Dole and John McCain. Some of these men were much less philosophically murky than Romney. Public Policy Polling has confirmed what most observers intuitively know: Gingrich's voters would mostly go to Santorum. If Gingrich were to bow out, it would finally permit the kind of one-on-one race -- conservative versus moderate -- that would make clear where the rank-and-file wants the Republican Party to go and where its true electoral strength this year lies. Let's see whether Republican voters really want a moderate of Romney's stripe to lead them. Gingrich has performed his service by showing that clear, pointed and intellectually well-formulated challenges to the country's current political drift will draw attention and support. Unless he wins handsomely in the Deep South, it's time to let Santorum -- whose intellectual and rhetorical gifts are not far behind Gingrich's -- lead the charge by himself. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Stephen M. Krason.","Stephen Krason: Newt Gingrich has had a lackluster performance in the GOP race .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- The House Republican leadership upped the ante Thursday in the ongoing debate over the size and scope of the federal budget, unveiling a proposal to cut spending by $375 billion over the next five years. House GOP Minority Whip Eric Cantor has been an outspoken critic of Democratic budget proposals. The bulk of the GOP's proposed savings would come from capping nondefense discretionary spending at the level of inflation. Among other things, the GOP proposal would also create a government spending review commission and eliminate retirement payments for federal workers who retire before the age of 62. President Obama ""challenged us to come up with budget savings, and today House Republicans encourage him to not only look over our proposed ... common-sense taxpayer savings, but to join our effort,"" House Minority Whip Eric Cantor, R-Virginia, said in a statement. ""For the sake of our young people and America's long-term fiscal viability, Congress simply cannot keep spending money that the president himself admits we don't have."" Obama asked congressional Republicans to propose new budget reductions during an April 24 meeting at the White House. In May, the administration proposed $17 billion in cuts from the more than $3.4 trillion in spending approved for next year. Democratic congressional leaders have said that Obama's proposed reductions are only the start of a long budget review process. They have also argued that more short-term spending is needed to help stimulate a weak economy. Under the current budget plan, the federal government will run an anticipated deficit of $1.2 trillion in the next fiscal year. The White House said Thursday the Republican plan fell far short of its claims. An administration official noted that the GOP pledge to use $45 billion in future TARP repayments to fund deficit reduction is already part of the president's plan. The official also pointed out that most of the expected savings Republicans list would come from capping discretionary spending on current programs that go mostly unidentified in Thursday's release except by category. The plan would also end similarly unspecified domestic programs in areas -- like education and infrastructure -- where significant cuts are unlikely to find the required congressional support. The actual dollar figure in savings that would come from cuts to programs specifically named in the GOP proposal is roughly $23 billion over five years -- around a quarter of the $100 billion in cuts Obama proposed several weeks ago.","NEW: .

"(CNN) -- As you drink a pint of Guinness or eat your corned beef and cabbage at the local Irish pub on St. Patrick's Day, consider the far-flung corners of Ireland where inspiration flourishes. ""The Irish landscape isn't always straightforward; its many layers of stone walls and hedgerows and its constantly changing light mean that it unfolds slowly as you walk, cycle or drive by,"" says Etain O'Carroll, co-author of Lonely Planet's 2012 Ireland guidebook. ""Our mercurial weather also gives it an ethereal quality,"" says O'Carroll. ""The dappled light and scurrying clouds, mists and rain showers mean you often catch no more than a tantalizing glimpse of a view.

CNN asked a handful of Irish poets, novelists and playwrights about the spots that inspire them in their mother country. Here are a few of our writers' favorite places. Ancient ruins amid a magnificent landscape . Although she was born and raised in County Monaghan, Mary O'Donnell's poetry and prose is inspired by the rough and wild landscape of the Burren, a region in County Clare where Ireland's ancient people managed to survive for centuries. O'Donnell is also fascinated by megalithic tombs, which is why she wrote a poem about Burren's Poulnabrone Dolmen, one of Ireland's most famous ancient monuments. Built more than 5000 years ago, the Neolithic/Bronze Age tomb housed remains and burial items such as pottery, jewelry and an ax. ""The world of nature is vitally important to me, and in the Burren in County Clare one finds a wild majesty and magnificent landscape that is still unspoiled, despite the many visitors the area attracts,"" says O'Donnell, author of ""Storm over Belfast,"" ""The Ark Builders "" and ""The Place of Miracles."" ""I am (also) enormously interested in megalithic tombs so this dolmen at Poulnabrone really grabbed me. The fact that my then 15-year-old daughter couldn't give a hoot about it made the visit all the more interesting, in a way. It set me thinking about how there are times in our lives when we need prescribed culture and there are times when we absolutely don't."" For the visitor: There are many ancient ruins to explore in the Burren through guided walks and tours. Returning to a literary hometown . Although he now lives in England, poet John McAuliffe often returns to his childhood home in Listowel to visit family and to recharge his writing. On the surface a typical North Kerry market town, Listowel has a literary tradition inspired by the playwright John B. Keane and fiction writer Bryan MacMahon. Keane ran a pub where writer Michael Hartnett and other writers and townspeople would gather, now operated by his widow and son. To a young boy, Keane and MacMahon both seemed of the town and outside it. ""They were after something penetrating, subtle and comprehending when they wrote, unsentimentally, about the town's hinterland of farming villages and about the positive impact of modernity on old hierarchies: wised-up insiders with a natural sympathy for the outsider,"" says McAuliffe, co-director of the Centre for New Writing at the University of Manchester, editor of ""The Manchester Review"" and author of ""Of All Places."" For the visitor: ""When I'm at home I walk Market Street, past John B's (pub) and into the redesigned town square where the terrific converted church, St. John's, hosts theater and music every week,"" says McAuliffe. ""I walk past the Listowel Arms Hotel -- where Charles Stuart Parnell made his last public address -- under Listowel Castle, whose ruin is now attached to an interactive museum, which documents and celebrates the work of John B. (Keane), (Bryan) MacMahon and other writers from the area."" A historic horse fair . Dublin-born and bred writer Nessa O'Mahony has always been inspired by Western Ireland, where her mother's family comes from. Her mother shared stories about her life growing up in Ballinasloe, in East Galway, with nine brothers and sisters. Those stories have crept into O'Mahoney's work. ""It seemed a form of rural Eden very distant to my own upbringing in a concrete and pebble-dash Dublin suburb in the 1960s,"" says O'Mahony, whose books include a novel, ""In Sight of Home,"" "" and two books of poetry, Bar Talk"" and ""Trapping a Ghost."" ""She had such freedom, and such fun and 'divilment,' as people used to say. We've returned to Ballinasloe frequently, though these days it's usually for a family funeral. But I'm still absorbed by how alive she [my mother] comes there, and how incredibly detailed her memories of a very happy past are. And I'm still inspired by her to write poems."" For the visitor: The Ballinasloe Horse Fair and Festival in October, one of the oldest in Europe, dates back at least to the 1700s and attracts thousands of visitors, traders and Irish Travellers (members of Ireland's nomadic community). Elsewhere in East Galway, William Butler Yeats spent time in the 1920s at Thoor Ballyle, a 16th century Norman tower that served as a summer home and inspiration for his poem ""The Tower."" An inspiration to Jane Austen . Novelist and playwright Belinda McKeon grew up on a farm in County Longford, a region that barely merits a mention in some of Ireland's tour books. Yet amidst the ordinary midland landscape dotted with nondescript schools, restaurants and gas stations is a literary tourist's dream. In Edgeworthstown, the local nursing home seemed like nothing special. But for a time, it had been the house of celebrated novelist Maria Edgeworth (1767-1849). It's where she lived almost all her life, where she wrote ""Castle Rackrent,"" received Sir Walter Scott and William Wordsworth as visitors, wrote criticisms of the absentee landlord system and where Jane Austen sent Edgeworth a first edition of her novel ""Emma."" Thomas LeFroy, believed to be the inspiration for Austen's Mr. Darcy character in ""Pride & Prejudice,"" lived in nearby Carriglas Manor. Growing up in Longford, with its ordinary life on top of extraordinary history, ""made me look sideways at everything,"" says McKeon, whose debut novel, ""Solace,"" was published last year. ""That's the way people look at things where I'm from: sideways. Never believing the first version of anything. Always wondering, always doubting, always looking forward to dissecting it afterwards."" For the visitor: Longford is known for Edgeworth, Carriglas, its fishing and the Corlea Trackway, a bog road that was built in 148 B.C. Inspiration at the ocean's edge . Born and raised in the town that inspired William Butler Yeats, short story writer Elaine Garvey heads to Sligo and the beach north of town to think and inspire her writing. ""There's one in North Sligo called Streedagh that's usually almost empty and you can walk on the strand almost every day, no matter if the tide is in or out,"" says Garvey, whose work has appeared in the The Dublin Review and a collection called ""ScÃÂ©alta."" ""I take my shoes off, leave them at the rocks and walk with my feet at the edge of the water -- unless it's snowing. I get my feet into the sand and have the sound and smell of the Atlantic all around me. It will always, always feel like home. If you walk the full length of the beach and back, you have clean feet and a very clear head by the end."" For the visitor: Sligo Town celebrates Yeats with the Yeats Memorial Building and the Yeats International Festival starting in late July with three weeks of poetry, music and other events.

"(CNN) -- Senate leaders and the White House struck a last-minute deal to avert the feared fiscal cliff Monday night, with Vice President Joe Biden headed to the Capitol Hill to pitch the plan to fellow Democrats. ""Happy New Year,"" Biden, who became the Democratic point man in the talks, told reporters. ""Did you think we would be here New Year's Eve?"" A senior Democratic aide told CNN that if caucus meetings went well, a Senate vote could come ""within the hour."" But the House of Representatives went home long before midnight, meaning nothing will get through Congress before the combination of tax increases and spending cuts lawmakers have been scrambling to head off starts to kick in, at least on paper. A source familiar with the deal told CNN that the Senate proposal would put off the cuts for two months and keep the expiring Bush-era tax cuts for individuals earning less than $400,000 or couples earning less than $450,000. President Barack Obama has long demanded that the threshold be set at $250,000. Tax rates on income above those levels would go back to the Clinton-era rate of 39.6%, up from the current 35%, and itemized deductions would be capped at $250,000 for individuals and $300,000 for couples. That would generate an estimated $600 billion in additional revenue over 10 years. Taxes on inherited estates will go up to 40% from 35%, but the exemption will be indexed to rise with inflation -- a provision the source said was added at the insistence of moderate Democrats. Unemployment insurance would be extended for a year for for 2 million people, and the alternative minimum tax -- a perennial issue -- would be permanently adjusted for inflation. Child care, tuition and research and development tax credits would be renewed. And the ""Doc Fix"" -- reimbursements for doctors who take Medicare patients -- will continue, but it won't be paid for out of the Obama administration's signature health care law. Biden had been in negotiations with Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky, since Sunday afternoon. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, both Democrats, agreed to the plan in calls with President Barack Obama, a Democratic source said Monday night. In the House, GOP sources said earlier Monday that there's little practical difference in settling the issue Monday night versus Tuesday. But if tax-averse House Republicans approve the bill on Tuesday -- when taxes have technically gone up -- they can argue they've voted for a tax cut to bring rates back down, even after just a few hours, GOP sources said. That could bring some more Republicans on board, one source said. Economists warn the one-two punch of tax increases and spending cuts, known as ""sequestration,"" could push the U.S. economy back into recession and drive unemployment back over 9% by the end of 2013. Obama had chided lawmakers for their last-minute scramble earlier Monday, hitting a nerve among several Republicans in the Senate. Latest updates: Final fiscal cliff scramble . ""They are close, but they're not there yet,"" he said. ""And one thing we can count on with respect to this Congress is that if there is even one second left before you have to do what you're supposed to do, they will use that last second."" The president warned that if Republicans think they can get future deficit reduction solely through spending cuts ""that will hurt seniors, or hurt students, or hurt middle-class families without asking also equivalent sacrifice from millionaires or companies with a lot of lobbyists ... they've got another thing coming."" That irked Republican senators who have been grappling for a deal with the Democratic majority in that chamber. Sen. Bob Corker, R-Tennessee, called the president's comments ""very unbecoming of where we are at this moment"" and added, ""My heart's still pounding."" ""I know the president has fun heckling Congress,"" Corker said. ""I think he lost probably numbers of votes with what he did."" Read more: Why your paycheck is getting smaller, no matter what . As Monday's deadline drew nigh, federal agencies were preparing for the possibility of furloughing workers. At the Pentagon, a Defense Department official said as many as 800,000 civilian employees could be forced to take unpaid days off as the armed services face an expected $62 billion in cuts in 2013 -- about 12% of its budget. Those workers perform support tasks across the department, from maintaining aircraft and weapons systems to processing military payrolls and counseling families. The Pentagon believes it can operate for at least two months before any furloughs are necessary, but has to warn its civilian workforce that furloughs could be coming, the official said. Read more: What if there's no deal on fiscal cliff . The White House budget office noted in September that sequestration was designed during the 2011 standoff over raising the federal debt ceiling as ""a mechanism to force Congress to act on further deficit reduction"" -- a kind of doomsday device that was never meant to be triggered. But Congress failed to substitute other cuts by the end of 2012, forcing the government to wield what the budget office called ""a blunt and indiscriminate instrument."" In its place, the Senate plan would use $12 billion in new tax revenue to replace half the expected deficit reduction from the sequester and leave another $12 billion in spending cuts, split half-and-half between defense and domestic programs. Read more: Medicare patients may suffer if country goes over fiscal cliff . Despite Obama's backing, one leading Senate Democrat warned a deal could run into trouble -- not only from House Republicans who have long opposed any tax increase, but also from liberals in the Senate who oppose allowing more high-income households to escape a tax increase. ""No deal is better than a bad deal, and this looks like a very bad deal the way this is shaping up,"" Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, said Monday morning. Late in the day, nothing had changed that would cause him to support the package. Conservative lobbyist Grover Norquist, whose Americans for Tax Reform pushes candidates to sign a pledge never to raise taxes, said the plan ""right now, as explained"" would preserve most of the Bush tax cuts and wouldn't violate his group's pledge. ""Take the 84% of your winnings off the table,"" Norquist told CNN. ""We spent 12 years getting the Democrats to cede those tax cuts to the American people. Take them off the table. Then we go back and argue about making the tax cuts permanent for everyone."" But Robert Reich, who served as labor secretary in the Clinton administration, said the $450,000 threshold ""means the lion's share of the burden of deficit reduction falls on the middle class, either in terms of higher taxes down the road or fewer government services."" In addition, he said, the plan does nothing to raise the federal debt ceiling just as the federal government bumps up against its borrowing limit. And that, Arizona GOP Sen. John McCain told CNN, is likely to be ""a whole new field of battle."" ""We just added 2.1 trillion in the last increase in the debt ceiling, and spending continues to go up,"" McCain said. ""I think there's going to be a pretty big showdown the next time around when we go to the debt limit."" CNN's Mike Pearson, Jessica Yellin, Dana Bash, Deirdre Walsh, Lisa Desjardins, Ted Barrett and Ashley Killough contributed to this report.","Senate leaders cut a deal to avoid the fiscal cliff .

"(CNN) -- The body of Andy Griffith, a North Carolina native and actor who for years won over audiences with his folksy appeal, was buried Tuesday morning less than five hours after he died. He passed away at around 7 a.m. ET at his home on Roanoke Island, authorities reported. At the request of his family, Griffith's body was lowered into a grave on the island at about 11:30 a.m. ET, according to a funeral spokesperson who declined to be named, citing the sensitivity of the matter. ""It had been planned for some time,"" said the spokesperson, who declined to reveal where on the island the body was buried. ""This was the wish of his family."" Most known for his role as the sheriff of Mayberry on the CBS series ""The Andy Griffith Show,"" Griffith died Tuesday after an unspecified illness and ""has been laid to rest on his beloved Roanoke Island,"" the family said in a statement. 'Mayberry' remembers Andy Griffith . But the speed with which the public learned of his death and was informed of his burial seemed especially fast, according to some observers. ""It's not very common,"" said Larry F. Stegall, executive director of the state's Funeral Directors Association. ""I don't recall having heard of it, and I've been here 32 years."" Traditional funeral customs often allow for a more extended period between death and burial, so family and friends may have more opportunity to visit and pay their respects. Still, said Stegall, ""the family's wishes are always abided by."" ""Andy was a person of incredibly strong Christian faith and was prepared for the day he would be called Home to his Lord,"" Griffith's wife, Cindi, said in a statement on Tuesday. A member of the Television Hall of Fame, Griffith also was inducted into the Christian Music Hall of Fame and Museum in 2007. His 1996 album, ""I Love to Tell the Story -- 25 Timeless Hymns,"" netted him a Grammy Award. Born in Mount Airy, North Carolina, in 1926, Griffith was a 1949 graduate of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, where he received a degree in music. What we love about Andy Griffith .

"New York (CNN) -- Exactly eight months after the ""brazen"" theft of a Salvador Dali painting from a Manhattan art gallery, a Greek national was indicted Tuesday on a grand larceny charge, according to the New York County District Attorney's Office. Phivos Istavrioglou, 29, is accused of stealing the 1949 Dali watercolor ""Cartel de Don Juan Tenorio"" on June 19 from the Venus Over Manhattan gallery. Istavrioglou is charged with one count of second-degree grand larceny and is scheduled to appear in court next Tuesday. He is being held on $100,000 bail, according to David Cohen, Istavrioglou's attorney. Istavrioglou was detained by Homeland Security agents on Saturday and arrested by the New York police after flying from Milan, Italy, to New York's Kennedy International Airport, according to a district attorney's office media release. An undercover detective posing as an art gallery business manager had invited Istavrioglou to New York, proposing to hire the defendant as an art gallery consultant, according to the district attorney's office. In June, Istavrioglou allegedly posed as a potential gallery customer, lifted the painting off a wall, placed it in a shopping bag and left the gallery, according to the district attorney's office statement. Surveillance video showed a suspect walking out of the gallery with a shopping bag, the district attorney's office statement said. ""Today's indictment brings us one step closer to bringing an international art caper to a close,"" New York County District Attorney Cy Vance said in the statement. The painting was sent back to the United States anonymously and was recovered at Kennedy International Airport customs on June 28. It was intercepted in a cardboard shipping tube en route to the same gallery. The painting was then returned to the gallery. The painting is valued at approximately $150,000. Cohen says his client is not facing mandatory jail time and that he plans on challenging his client's high bail.","A Greek national is charged with grand larceny in the theft from a Manhattan gallery .

"(CNN) -- The South Carolina Republican presidential primary is often a free-for-all, but this year's contest probably sets a new standard for volatility. Not surprisingly, Palmetto State GOP insiders see a close finish in the primary Saturday between former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney and former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, according to a CNN survey. Less than 48 hours before voters would go to the polls, they were buffeted by a sudden announcement from Texas Gov. Rick Perry that he was withdrawing from the Republican presidential race and endorsing rival Gingrich. And as Perry was dropping out, the political world was buzzing with reports that Gingrich's second wife, Marianne, said that her then-husband proposed an ""open marriage"" before they divorced. Then, a fiery Gingrich struck back at the opening of the CNN debate in Charleston, attacking the ""liberal media"" for bringing up the story in the first place. ""It's like a darned soap opera,"" said one South Carolina GOP insider. ""Never seen things this fluid,"" echoed another. A CNN survey of 42 South Carolina GOP insidersÃ¢â¬âincluding Republican state legislators, state and local party officials, business and conservative interest group leaders, veterans of previous presidential primary campaigns, Palmetto State GOP political consultants, and other party activistsÃ¢â¬âfound a close race between the top two contenders. Three South Carolina GOP insiders thought the race would end in a dead heat between the two Republican contenders. The insiders were asked: Who do you think will win the South Carolina primary? Mitt Romney -- 33% . Newt Gingrich -- 31% . Rick Santorum -- 19% . Ron Paul -- 15% . Rick Perry -- N/A . Other --2% . Compared to a similar sounding of GOP insiders earlier in the week before Perry withdrew, it appeared that Gingrich had gained the most momentum in the closing days of the race. Before Perry dropped out: . Mitt Romney -- 32% . Newt Gingrich -- 25% . Rick Santorum -- 18% . Ron Paul -- 15% . Rick Perry -- 8% . Other -- 2% . While Romney still edged Gingrich slightly in the minds of these insiders, the narrow margin and the ever-changing story lines mean Gingrich could still pull an upset Saturday. ""Romney's supporters seem to be firmly behind him at this point, while Gingrich could still gain or lose support depending on how things shake out over the (final) days,"" said one GOP insider. ""For this reason, I'm still giving Romney the nod at this point."" One major uncertainty hanging over the race is the impact of the controversial television interview that Gingrich's second wife, Marianne, gave to ABC's Nightline in which she said Gingrich had asked her to consider an arrangement that she described as an ""open marriage."" In the CNN South Carolina debate on Thursday night, Gingrich denounced the media's handling of the story and called the accusation ""false."" ""Right now, I speculate that people voting for Newt may have accounted for his personal baggage in their decision making, without knowing the full extent of it,"" said one South Carolina GOP insider. ""However, requests for open marriage don't play well with value-voters upstate, which seems to be the current heart of the Gingrich surge. I think this interview could diminish, or at least cap, his support with those voters."" The CNN South Carolina GOP insiders were surveyed from the evening of Jan. 16 thru the morning of January 18, and again between January 19 and the morning of January 20. The survey was conducted over the internet; some interviews were conducted by phone. The South Carolina insiders were given anonymity for their individual answers in order to encourage candid responses. And while some insiders were aligned with one or another of the presidential campaigns, two-thirds said they had neither endorsed nor were they working for any candidate in the race. Here are the names of the participants in the survey: Eric Bedingfield, Peter Brown, Kevin Bryant, Luke Byars, Drea Byars, Chris Carino, Phillip Cease, Alan Clemmons, Chad Connelley, Wesley Donehue, Shannon Erickson, Justin Evans, Scott Farmer, Chip Felkel, Becky Fleming, Douglas Ford, Greg Foster, Mark Harmon, Wes Hayes, Allen Klump, Scott Malyerck, Janice McCord, Joe McKeown, Drew McKissick, Ed McMullen, Matt Moore, Matthew Nichols, Mark Nix, Ralph Norman, Randy Page, Sunny Philips, Mike Pitts, Tommy Pope, Richard Quinn, Jay W.

"(CNN) -- A U.S.-run detention center housing 3,000 people will move to Afghan control under a crucial agreement signed Friday that smooths the way toward a larger agreement on the United States' future role in the country. The agreement, which calls for the gradual transfer of power from U.S. forces to Afghanistan over six months, removes one key sticking point from negotiations over a broader agreement on the role of the United States in Afghanistan after foreign combat troops withdraw in 2014. Negotiations over the wide-ranging strategic agreement have been going on for more than a year, with little progress. Tensions between the two countries, made worse by the February burning of Qurans by U.S. troops at Bagram Air Base, have complicated the talks. In November, a loya jirga, or grand assembly of Afghan elders, endorsed the continued presence of U.S. forces after combat operations, but only if the countries could agree on the transfer of prisoners, an end to night raids and eliminating immunity for U.S. troops accused of committing crimes in Afghanistan. U.S. and Afghan officials have already begun talks on the other major issue gumming up the larger agreement: night raids by U.S. special operations forces, according to U.S. and Afghan officials who jointly briefed reporters. ""The signing of this memorandum is an important step forward in our Strategic Partnership negotiations and very much in keeping with both the Loya Jirga's recommendations and the desires of President (Hamid) Karzai,"" said U.S. Gen. John Allen, commander of the International Security Assistance Force. Karzai has repeatedly called for the end of U.S. oversight of detention facilities in the country. On Friday, his spokesman, Aimal Faizi, called the agreement ""big progress."" ""Things are happening as we wanted,"" Faizi said. U.S. Ambassador Ryan Crocker said the memorandum of understanding, or MOU, demonstrates the United States' commitment to Afghan sovereignty and its partnership with Afghanistan, despite ups and downs in the tense relationship between the two countries. ""We have had our challenges, and there will be challenges ahead as we continue negotiations on the framework for our strategic partnership, but this MOU marks an important step forward,"" he said. The agreement calls for the United States to transfer all of the approximately 3,000 Afghan citizens currently held under U.S. guard at the Parwan detention facility near Bagram Air Base to Afghan authorities within six months. The first 500 detainees would be transferred within 45 days, according to the agreement. Transferred detainees will eventually be moved to new facilities being built in Parwan and Pol-I-Charki, but until then will be moved from the U.S. side of Parwan to the Afghan side of the center. Although detainees would be held by Afghanistan, U.S. forces would remain at Parwan in a ""technical advisory and logistical support"" role, the officials who briefed reporters said. Afghan commanders also would not have the authority to release detainees on their own, according to agreement. Any request to release a prisoner would have to be agreed to by a joint committee headed by the ISAF commander and the Afghan defense minister, according to the agreement. The deal does not apply to about 50 non-Afghan prisoners being held at Parwan. Their fate was unclear. The officer currently responsible for prison protection, identified by Defense Ministry spokesman Gen. Zahir Azimi as Gen. Safiullah, will take over the Parwan facility, which is the successor to one demolished in 2009 after allegations of abuse. That facility, called the Bagram Theater Internment Facility, was the site of abusive interrogation that ended in the deaths of two detainees in 2002, according to Amnesty International, which has described abusive treatment of detainees at the facility as common. While the new center has not seen that level of scandal, Amnesty International and other groups have continued to challenge conditions of detention at the facility, including seeking access to U.S. courts for those held at Parwan. The group also complained in 2010 about allegations of abuse, including isolation, sleep deprivation and exposure to extreme temperatures, at a screening facility at Bagram Air Base. The Bagram base was also the site of the recent Quran burnings that set off a wave of protests and violence targeting NATO troops. The Muslim holy books had been seized from a detainee center and allegedly contained militant annotations. U.S. President Barack Obama apologized for the incident, saying it was inadvertent.","United States and Afghanistan reach deal to transfer detainees .

"Baghdad (CNN) -- A camp housing Iranian dissidents in Iraq was attacked Saturday morning, leaving at least five dead and 40 wounded, Iraqi police said. The rocket and mortar attack occurred at Camp Hurriya, a onetime U.S. base formerly known as Camp Liberty, which is now the home of the Iranian exile group Mujahedin-e-Khalq. Accounts of the number of people killed and wounded in the attack vary. Shahriar Kia, an MEK spokesman, said the incident left six dead and more than 100 injured, some of them critically. He blamed one of the deaths on delays in getting the injured to the hospital. The U.S. State Department also listed six fatalities. It urged the Iraqi government to investigate the attack promptly and take all appropriate measures to enhance camp security. ""The terrorists responsible for this attack must be brought to justice,"" said department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland. Residents at the camp were vulnerable both because the attack happened when most were asleep and because many lack adequate shelter, said Kia. The residents are ""squeezed into a small area, without shelter,"" said Kia. Protective concrete walls have also been removed from the site, he said. It's not yet known who is responsible for the attack. MEK last year moved from Camp Ashraf in Diyala province to Camp Hurriya in Baghdad. Leaders of the dissident group had been reluctant to move to the new camp because of the conditions there, calling it more of a prison than a home when they first arrived. The group's move to the base is intended as a temporary measure before members are resettled in third countries. Residents and their representatives and lawyers have appealed to the U.N. Secretary-General and U.S. officials to let them return to Ashraf, which they say has concrete buildings and shelters that offer more protection. The United States has been working with the U.N. High Commissioner of Refugees on the resettlement project. Martin Kobler, special representative for Iraq of the U.N. secretary-general, strongly condemned the attack on the camp, which ""led to the killing and injury of several residents."" Several Iraqi police officers were also wounded, he said in a statement. Kobler urged the Iraqi authorities to ensure that those who were injured get the medical care they need. He also called for the government to ensure the safety and security of the camp residents, as stipulated by the 2011 resettlement agreement, and promptly to investigate the attack and bring those behind it to justice. MEK was removed from a U.S. State Department terror list in September, following a decision by then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. The group was put on the list of Foreign Terrorist Organizations, which includes more than 50 groups like al Qaeda and Hezbollah, in 1997 because of the killing of six Americans in Iran in the 1970s and an attempted attack against the Iranian mission to the United Nations in 1992. However, since 2004 the United States has considered the group, which spent more than 25 years at the Ashraf camp, ""noncombatants"" and ""protected persons"" under the Geneva Conventions. Iran still considers the group to be a terrorist organization.

"Washington (CNN) -- President Barack Obama's assertion of executive privilege ahead of a hearing before a House committee, which subsequently recommended his attorney general be cited for contempt of Congress, sets up a fight that has had mixed results in the past. At stake are Justice Department documents relating to the flawed Fast and Furious gunrunning sting that House Oversight Committee Chairman Darrell Issa, R-California, wants in his hands, and that Attorney General Eric Holder says are confidential. The White House move means the Department of Justice can withhold the documents from the committee, which recommended by a 23-17 vote Wednesday that Holder be cited for contempt. The full House is expected to consider the motion next week. More details: House panel recommends contempt citation . If it votes to issue a contempt citation, a statement of facts would be delivered to the U.S. Attorney in the District of Columbia, ""whose duty it shall be to bring the matter before the grand jury for its action,"" according to the law governing contempt citations. Executive privilege also has been around since the earliest days of the country, and gives the executive branch the ability to withhold certain internal discussions and documents from scrutiny. ""It's there to give the executive branch some breathing room for its own deliberations,"" said Josh Chafetz, professor of law at Cornell Law School. Executive privilege ""has a long history, but it often plays out very differently,"" he said. The last major confrontation over executive privilege also involved the Justice Department, but the partisan roles were reversed. Q&A: What's going on and what comes next . In 2007, President George W. Bush insisted that White House Counsel Harriet Miers and White House Chief of Staff Joshua Bolten wouldn't testify under oath or provide subpoenaed information about the firings of nine U.S. attorneys, a controversy that had led to the resignation of Attorney General Alberto Gonzales the year before. House Democrats, who were in the majority at the time, believed the firings were politically motivated and wanted to force the pair to testify about them. The House voted 223-32 to cite Miers and Bolten for contempt (most GOP members walked out in protest), but when Congress sued the pair, the case never made it to court. It was settled between the two sides with mixed results: The House got some of the testimony it wanted, but not until 2009, when Obama was in office. The real aim of Congress had been to get oversight of the Bush administration, but he had already left the White House when the information was made available, Chafetz said. Historically, presidents' claims of executive privilege rarely have been accepted by Congress. When power brokers from those two branches clash, it is often left to political expediency or the courts to sort out the competing interests. Edward Lazarus, author of a book on the Supreme Court, ""Closed Chambers,"" said that when such a ""showdown among two co-equal branches of government"" occurs, ""the judiciary often becomes the referee."" iReport: Tell us what you think . The claim arises from the constitutional idea of separation of powers. The concept is not a settled legal precept, since it has been open to varying interpretations, and it remains a controversial, litigated part of government business. ""The main factor that courts usually use is internal deliberations,"" said CNN Senior Legal Analyst Jeffrey Toobin. ""The courts want to respect the president's internal deliberations so he can get freely given advice from his aides. They don't want to invade that privilege. However, that's not an absolute privilege for everything that goes on in the White House."" Constitutional groundwork . The U.S. Constitution does not expressly mention this idea of executive privilege. President George Washington set the precedent in 1796 when he refused a House request for documents relating to how the Jay Treaty with Great Britain was negotiated. The Supreme Court first decided the issue in 1807, during Aaron Burr's separate trial for treason. Chief Justice John Marshall ordered President Thomas Jefferson to produce a letter that might have exonerated the former vice president. The court concluded the Sixth Amendment right of compulsory process did not exempt the executive branch. The letter was turned over, but its contents never were publicly revealed, at Jefferson's insistence. As may ultimately prove to be the case in the Fast and Furious controversy, the Burr issue was privately negotiated, without a subpoena being issued. The high court has not spoken with one voice on executive privilege. In 1927, it ruled that the executive branch was not protected from ""legitimate"" outside investigations. In 1948, presidential prerogatives were preserved in relation to private lawsuits where national security or military matters are involved. Executive privilege claims have risen sharply since the 1950s, but most presidents since Dwight D. Eisenhower have assured Congress that such claims would only be asserted with their personal approval, as Holder indicated Obama did in this case. Of Watergate and task forces . The biggest recent executive privilege case was U.S. v. Nixon in 1974, during the Watergate crisis. That involved a criminal grand jury subpoena for the president to turn over secretly recorded Oval Office audiotapes. The justices unanimously ruled against his legal claims, saying there was great national interest that the tapes be produced. Nevertheless, for the first time the Supreme Court recognized the constitutional basis for executive privilege. ""Nowhere in the Constitution ... is there any explicit reference to a privilege of confidentiality,"" that ruling said, ""yet to the extent this interest relates to the effective discharge of a president's powers, it is constitutionally based."" The court then recognized that ""those who expect public dissemination of their remarks may well temper candor with a concern for appearances and for their interest, to the detriment of the decision-making process."" In other words, the Supreme Court laid out a balancing test of sorts: a basic need for executive confidentiality and candor, weighed against the public interests of congressional oversight, a criminal inquiry or prosecution. President Bill Clinton's first term produced an interesting legal dilemma that later popped in subsequent administrations. Then-first lady Hillary Clinton chaired a health care task force that was sued for closing to the public several meetings with government and private officials. The issue was whether she as the first lady was a government employee and therefore could claim executive privilege. A federal appeals court concluded she could. The issue emerged again in 2001, when Vice President Dick Cheney was sued for his role chairing an energy task force. Only this time the issue was whether executive privilege applied to conversations by White House officials with those outside the government. Cheney was taken to court by private groups and the Government Accounting Office seeking information on what energy company officials and lobbyists might have advised the group, whose conclusions later formed the basis of the administration's energy policy. A lawsuit claimed those contacts improperly benefited private energy businesses. The private lawsuit reached the Supreme Court after two years of legal wrangling, and the White House won a temporary victory. Justice Anthony Kennedy wrote, ""Special considerations applicable to the president and the vice president suggest that the courts should be sensitive to requests by the government"" in such appeals. The government claimed in its legal brief that it is ""clear that the president's authority to receive opinions from executive officers is not subject to interference from or control by other branches"" of government. The case was sent back to the lower courts and, after about five years, was settled without the government turning over the requested documents. The foreseeable future and beyond . Time may be on the side of the White House, if it is determined to see this issue played out in the courts. The case could take many months, or even years, to be resolved. The use of contempt measures or executive privileges can blur the line between law and politics. Congress benefits from having the Fast and Furious controversy viewed as an issue of tremendous national importance, and from affirming the power of the legislature to serve as a check on the executive. It has not been shy invoking the threat of subpoenas. Administration supporters have countered that the request for documents by the Republican-led oversight committee amounts to election-year politics, with the goal of embarrassing Obama. The president has two centuries of precedent to rely upon, and no clear sign the courts want to resolve the issue with some bedrock finality. ""The executive branch is taking the long-term view of this,"" said legal analyst Lazarus. ""You need to develop golden rules in this situation that will apply regardless of who is in power, to come up with a fair way to hold the president accountable without unduly chilling speech with the executive branch.""

"(CNN) -- A court hearing in Philadelphia took an unforeseen turn when a witness, testifying about the consequences of losing his left eye in an alleged assault, began crying and his prosthetic eyeball popped out of its socket and into his hand, unsettling the jury and resulting in a mistrial, according to attorneys involved. ""I've been a prosecutor for 26 years and I've never seen anything like that happen. It was unusual; it was shocking,"" said Philadelphia Assistant District Attorney Mark Gilson, who is prosecuting Mathew Brunelli, 23, charged with aggravated assault, for allegedly stabbing John Huttick in the eye during a bar fight in August 2011. The eye had to be surgically removed, Gilson said. ""He was crying, and when it came out, he caught in his hand and just held it there,"" said defense attorney Eileen J. Hurley, ""It was a shocking event to witness."" ""Two jurors visibly gasped and jumped up like they were getting out of their seats,"" Hurley said. ""The judge had to call recess and let everyone take a breath,"" Gilson added. Hurley said after the recess, she felt the trial couldn't go on because the event could generate extra sympathy for Huttick, prejudicing the jury against Brunelli. ""A bell like that can't be unrung,"" Hurley said. Judge Robert P. Coleman granted Hurley's request for a mistrial. ""Let's face it; it was no secret. The evidence shows the victim was stabbed in the eye. There is medical testimony. Everyone knew (Huttick) has a prosthetic eye,"" said Gilson. ""I don't think it was enough to declare a mistrial, but it's at the discretion of the judge, so we have to start over."" Hurley contends her client didn't stab anyone. ""My client was trying to defend himself and his girlfriend and trying to leave,"" she said, noting that Huttick is much taller and weighs much more than Brunelli. ""He was not arrested that night, and criminal charges weren't filed until months later when (Huttick) filed a civil suit against my client,"" she added. ""We have an expert that will say it was just a fist."" ""The issue is settled; he admitted he punched the victim and caused the injuries, but claims there was no weapon,"" said Gilson, ""That's just unbelievable. The man's eye had a puncture wound. That's not a punch."" The case is set to be retried March 4.","John Huttick lost his prosthetic eye while testifying in a court hearing about an assault .

"New York (CNN) -- She may be out of Washington and on the road for the week, but the heavy machinery of office has followed Secretary of State Hillary Clinton to New York as she attends the annual United Nations General Assembly meetings. To be sure, the secretary always has a traveling staff with her wherever she may be in the world. But UNGA, with its hundreds of diplomats, ministers and heads of state converging on New York every September, is a much different animal from a trip to a world capitol. Basically, Foggy Bottom moves up to the Big Apple and sets up a mini-State Department on the 24th floor of the Waldorf Astoria. CNN was granted rare and exclusive access to this massive operation, one that involves hundreds of employees, planeloads full of equipment and a ton of coffee. As we exited the elevator on the 24th floor, it became clear this was indeed a secure work space, with numerous Diplomatic Security guards and several signs reminding staff not to discuss classified information in the hallways. It seemed as if U.S. foreign policy hadn't skipped a beat despite being a few hundred miles removed from home base. With the beds in each room removed (though the head boards where still bolted to the wall), the rooms have been transformed into working offices with secure telephone lines, computers, fax machines and all of the equipment needed to do the job of executing the nation's diplomacy. As we were escorted down one of the halls, Capricia Penavic Marshall, the department's chief of protocol, was working with her staff to prepare for what was already shaping up to be an marathon of a week. Marshall's office is responsible for advising on matters of international diplomatic protocol, making sure the right atmosphere is created for conducting diplomacy. Even though Marshall was congratulating the staff for an earlier event that went off successfully, staff members have a long week ahead assuring there are no diplomatic glitches when President Barack Obama and Secretary Clinton meet with many of their counterparts. Helping manage protocol for more than 190 U.N. member states is a juggling act Marshall's protocol team has to perfect every UNGA. Every regional office, such as the Bureau of African Affairs, the Bureau of East Asian Affairs, and the Bureau of Near East Affairs, which oversees the Middle East, had taken over a room or two and had staff busy working the phones trying to set up meetings for Clinton while she is in town. Benjamin Sand with International Organization Affairs -- the bureau responsible for managing the U.S. relationship with United Nations and all other international organizations -- said the pressure of managing the week's itinerary was more like ""finals week"" in college, except that it would be the entire world grading his office's performance as opposed to a lone professor. Despite the enormity of the task at hand, some of his staff was already at work preparing for next year's UNGA. Tuli Mushing set up Clinton's executive office at the Waldorf. He said brought ""a lot"" of people up from Washington to make sure the secretary had everything at her disposal to operate effectively. Special Agent T.J. Lunardi of the Diplomatic Security Service has an office set up to oversee the security for Clinton as she travels around New York for her meetings, as well as the security for all other non-head of state dignitaries. Lunardi says he has to create ""a protective bubble"" so the State Department can move into a hotel building where employees can handle and discuss sensitive information the department needs in order to function. Lunardi's work also extends to the 34th floor of the Waldorf , the floor where Obama and Clinton will hold bilateral meetings with their counterparts this week. A separate staff works on the 34th floor, preparing the room where Clinton would be meeting with the Japanese and Russian foreign ministers, and the pool of reporters who would shuffle in to ask questions and take pictures of the two shaking hands. Linda Dewan works on 34th floor setting up the ""bi-lat"" room. Each has what looks like an ordinary conference table dressed up with flowers, but Linda explains how every name card, glass of water and pencil is placed just so, according to diplomatic procedure established under former Secretary of State James Baker. Back on 24, the General Services Office is busy preparing briefing books of information for Clinton to cover the subject of every meeting on her daily schedule. George Rowland, a senior support specialist in the office, said he expected to go through 40 to 50 cases of paper this week to prepare the books. Many of the rooms had the large brown ""burn bags"" -- the final destination for much of that paper -- in which the shredded remains of sensitive documents are placed before they are burned. Down the hall in room 24M, members of the press are getting ready for Clinton's ""photo-op"" with the Japanese foreign minister. Bomb dogs are sniffing cameras and Gladys Boggs is rounding up the journalists and cameramen. Boggs has been running these photo ops for decades. It's not just shuffling the press into a room: Boggs spends months advancing the site, making sure the media gets a good shot to illustrate the diplomacy secretaries of state are conducting. Matt Lee, a veteran State Department reporter, says UNGA week is always a big hassle because of the famous New York City traffic, but it's a good opportunity to see lots of sources and get a better sense of the full diplomatic picture. Lee is well-known for his tough questions, but he says he wouldn't be doing his job if he didn't push the State Department to explain how all the meetings here at UNGA translate in to U.S. foreign policy. As we take the freight elevator up to the 34th floor and wait in a elevator vestibule, reporters are discussing what question to toss out to Clinton. Along with Cami McCormack from CBS, we ask Clinton about her hopes to avert a showdown with Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas at the U.N. Security Council over the Palestinian statehood issue. Usually Clinton doesn't speak at the photo-ops, but she had a message to deliver: The United States doesn't think action at the United Nations will lead to a peace deal and she hopes to find a compromise before Abbas' speech on Friday. It's not breaking news, but reporters fly back down to 24M file the comments for their outlets. As Obama and Clinton continue a whirlwind schedule of meetings and dinners, the frenetic pace of work will continue on the 24th floor of the Waldorf. When Clinton leaves the secure lines will be removed and the sensitive documents destroyed, and a new set of guests will take their place. Until next year.","U.N.

"(CNN) -- Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said the U.S. can do more to help Mexico battle drug cartels that have started operating more like terrorists and insurgent groups. ""It is one of my highest priorities,"" Clinton said Friday during a speech in San Francisco at the nonpartisan Commonwealth Club. ""This is one of the most difficult fights that any country faces today. We saw it over the last couple of decades in Colombia."" ""We are watching drug traffickers undermine and corrupt governments in Central America, and we are watching the brutality and barbarity of their assaults on governors and mayors, the press, as well as each other, in Mexico,"" she added. Clinton said the U.S. can do more than sending the Blackhawk helicopters it promised Mexico. She said the U.S. is helping Mexico create an anonymous tipline to report drug cartels. However, she said, it can also help Mexico rebuild its criminal system and train its police force. She likened recent drug cartel violence to terror groups. ""For the first time, they are using car bombings,"" Clinton said. ""You see them being much more organized in a kind of paramilitary way."" Clinton's remarks come the same week she discussed the U.S. effort to find David Hartley, an American believed to have been shot by drug bandits on the border of Mexico and Texas. The United States is ""supporting local law enforcement, supporting the authorities on the border, doing everything that we know to do to try to assist in helping to find the body and helping to find the perpetrators,"" she said. Hartley is reported to have been shot during a September 30 boating trip by gunmen investigators believe are linked to a Mexican drug gang.","Clinton speaks at a club in San Francisco .

"(CNN) -- The federal judge presiding over the case of reputed former Boston mob boss James ""Whitey"" Bulger has been removed by the First Circuit Court of Appeals in Boston, after the defense raised concerns about his ability to be impartial. The judge, Richard Stearns, was as a prosecutor in the criminal division of the U.S. Attorney's Office in Boston when Bulger is alleged to have reigned over organized crime in the city, the First Circuit Court of Appeals in Boston noted. ""Despite our respect for Judge Stearns and our belief in his sincerity, we are nonetheless bound to conclude that it is clear that a reasonable person might question the judge's ability to preserve impartiality through the course of this prosecution,"" the appeals court ruled. Bulger, the alleged former head of Boston's notorious Winter Hill gang, faces 19 murder charges, as well as charges including extortion, money laundering and narcotics distribution. The defense had initially moved to dismiss the case, saying Bulger was granted immunity by federal agents working to infiltrate Irish and Italian mobs in Boston three decades ago. But Stearns ruled this month that Bulger did not have immunity to commit murder or other crimes after his purported deal with the FBI. A new judge will be assigned to the case, the appeals court ruling said. Bulger made headlines when he was arrested in June 2011 in Santa Monica, California, after being on the run for 16 years. Before his sudden departure from Boston, he cooperated as an informant with disgraced ex-FBI agent John Connolly Jr., who is serving a 50-year sentence for second-degree murder and racketeering. According to an indictment against Connolly filed in 2000, Bulger became his confidential informant in the fall of 1975. CNN's Jason Kessler and Melissa Gray contributed to this report.","Appeals court: Judge's impartiality might be in question because of his past jobs .

"(CNN) -- Africa is ready to host the Olympic Games for the first time despite ""prejudice"" against its capabilities, claims the continent's top soccer official. Issa Hayatou, who has been president of the Confederation of African Football since 1987, told CNN that several African countries could stage the four-yearly competition. South Africa has already successfully hosted the FIFA World Cup in 2010, the first African nation to do so, and Hayatou believes it can put on the other contender for the title of the planet's biggest sporting event. ""South Africa can definitely organize the Olympic Games, with its infrastructure, hotels, communications, transport,"" he said Saturday. ""I don't know if there are 10 countries in Europe that can be better than South Africa in that respect. ""But there are other countries in Africa that can organize an Olympic Games like Morocco, Egypt, Algeria -- I could also include Nigeria. All those countries could organize it, but there's a prejudice -- they say, 'Oh, it's Africa, they can't organize it.' "" The 66-year-old believes South Africa has done a good job of hosting this month's Africa Cup of Nations football tournament despite some small crowds and substandard playing surfaces. ""The challenge was to have a successful Africa Cup of Nations because some people thought we couldn't succeed because South Africa isn't at the top of the sport at the moment,"" said the Cameroonian, a member of the International Olympic Committee and also a FIFA vice-president. ""But the organizing committee showed a lot of effort and did everything to ensure that this competition would go well. Of course, all the stadiums are not full, unlike what happened at the World Cup but for an Africa Cup of Nations I think we've had a record attendance level. ""We have sold just over 750,000 tickets which is a very good result."" However, African football journalist O.G. Molefe told CNN that the tournament has been slightly disappointing despite some of the top players on show. ""They had set an amount of 500,000 tickets to be sold for the tournament, but I still think it's not enough,"" said Molefe, a correspondent for the broadcaster eNCA. ""Look at a game like Nigeria-Ivory Coast in the quarterfinals, one that you would have thought would be a sellout -- but it wasn't. It shows there is a lot of work for CAF to do to fill stadiums for such a tournament."" Sunday's title match in Johannesburg will be between two-time champions Nigeria and first-time finalists Burkina Faso. ""It's a competition that's created a lot of surprises,"" Hayatou said. ""If I'm honest Nigeria is a big football team but Burkina Faso never reached that level before. ""So although it's a surprise it's a good surprise because Nigeria and Burkina have produced a good quality of football and that's been satisfying to see. If they show us in the final what we saw in the quarterfinals and the semifinals it will be a very beautiful final that the whole world will enjoy."" Molefe said Nigeria's ""Super Eagles"" had done well to reach their first final since losing on home soil in 2000, with coach Stephen Keshi leaving out several big-name Europe-based players for the tournament. ""I don't think many people would have predicted that the Super Eagles would get to the final,"" he said. ""To have reached this stage has been a big surprise but they've got a lot of great players who have played very well. Not a lot of people gave them a chance of beating the Ivory Coast."" Keshi is waiting until the last minute to decide on the fitness of four-goal Emmanuel Emenike and Victor Moses, who has netted twice in the tournament, after the key forward duo suffered injuries in the semifinal win over Mali. The Burkinabe have been boosted by the rescinding of Jonathan Pitroipa's sending-off against Ghana, with officials admitting he should not have received a second booking. At the beginning of the tournament it was Cape Verde being the fairytale story but now it's moved to Burkina Faso,"" Molefe said. ""They've done well to reach this point. I think with Jonathan Pitroipa coming back to play the final after getting that red card it's going to be a big motivation for them to go out and pull off a big upset."" Meanwhile, Mali claimed third place for the second year in a row after beating Ghana 3-1 in a rematch of the 2012 playoff. Mali led 2-0 through a diving header by Mahamadou Samassa and Seydou Keita's third goal of the tournament, but Ghana's Wakaso Mubarak missed the chance to net his fifth when he blazed a 58th-minute penalty over the bar in the pouring rain at Nelson Mandela Stadium in Port Elizabeth. The Black Stars, who won the last of their four African titles in 1982, got back into the game in the 82nd minute when Mali goalkeeper SoumbeÃ¯la Diakite was completely wrongfooted by a speculative long-range shot by Kwadwo Asamoah. However, substitute Sigamary Diarra settled the match in time added on to give some cheer to a country embroiled in conflict between Islamist rebel forces, government troops and the French military.","African football chief Issa Hayatou says continent is ready to stage the Olympic Games .

"Washington (CNN) -- Cyberattacks pose more of a threat to the United States than a land-based attack by a terrorist group, while North Korea's development of a nuclear weapons program poses a ""serious threat,"" the director of national intelligence told Congress on Tuesday. The warning by Director of National Intelligence James Clapper came in his annual report to Congress on the threats facing the United States. ""Attacks, which might involve cyber and financial weapons, can be deniable and unattributable,"" Clapper said in prepared remarks before the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence. ""Destruction can be invisible, latent and progressive."" The Internet is increasingly being used as a tool both by nations and terror groups to achieve their objectives, according to Clapper's report. However, there is only a ""remote chance"" of a major cyberattack on the United States that would cause widespread disruptions, such as regional power outages, the report says. Most countries or groups don't have the capacity to pull it off. While Clapper emphasized possible cyberthreats, committee members raised questions about the potential nuclear dangers posed by North Korea and Iran, the increasing prevalence of al Qaeda in Syria and the effect of cuts to the U.S. budget on intelligence activities. President Obama cracks whip on cybercrime . 'Belligerent rhetoric' Angered by U.N. Security Council sanctions over its nuclear test, North Korea threatened for the first time to launch a pre-emptive nuclear strike against the United States and South Korea. Even by North Korean standards, the threat of a nuclear strike and the scrapping of a 1953 truce that effectively ended the Korean War have been incredibly provocative, Clapper said. ""The rhetoric, while it is propaganda laced, is also an indicator of their attitude and perhaps their intent,"" he said, adding he was concerned what, if any, provocative action North Korea would take against its southern neighbor. Sen. Angus King, I-Maine, quizzed Clapper about what, if any, deterrence, works with North Korea and Iran, who have been slapped with numerous U.N. Security Council sanctions over the development of a nuclear program. ""Mutually assured destruction? Are they responsive to that kind of rational thinking that has guided U.S. policy for 50 years? Are these countries like the (former) Soviet Union, that we can have some confidence that they're gonna make a rational decision knowing that if they do something crazy they are going to be wiped out?"" King asked. Clapper told the committee he believed that both North Korea and Iran understand that. North Korea, for whatever reason, believes the United States would use a nuclear weapon against it, Clapper said. ""They certainly respect the capability for our military,"" he said. ""They've gone to school on what we've done starting with Desert Storm. I know that for a fact. So I think deterrence in this broadest context does work and does have impact on decision-making calculus of those these two countries."" Opinion: Have the courage to deal with cyber war . Al Qaeda's influence in Syria . Clapper also warned the committee that Syria's chemical weapons program has the potential to inflict mass causalities. ""It adds to our concern that the increasingly beleaguered regime, having found its escalation of violence through conventional means inadequate, might be prepared to use the chemical weapons against the Syrian people,"" he said. He said the obvious question is how long embattled Syrian President Bashar al-Assad can hang on to power. Syria has been mired in a civil war for more than two years. ""And our standard answer is his days are numbered. We just don't know the number,"" he told the committee. ""I think our assessment is, he is very committed to hanging in there and sustaining control of the regime."" Perhaps the bigger concern is the rising influence and strength of the al-Nusra Front, an ""al Qaeda in Iraq"" offshoot, among the Syrian rebels, he said. The potential of the core of al Qaeda to ""launch a coordinated, massive attack"" against the United States, according to Clapper, has diminished, while the global jihadist movement is more decentralized and, therefore, more of a threat. ""Lone wolves, domestic extremists and jihadist-inspired groups remain determined to attack Western interests as they've done most recently in Libya and Algeria."" The threat assessment describes an environment where jihadist terrorists are increasingly decentralized, creating challenges for the prevention of attacks. Al Qaeda vs. jihadist groups . Many of these groups have gained a foothold in the Arab Spring countries, where a spike in threats to U.S. interests has been recorded, the threat assessment report said. ""The dispersed and decentralized nature of the terrorist networks (that are) active in the region highlights that the threat to U.S. and Western interests overseas is more likely to be unpredictable,"" it states. It cites the Benghazi, Libya, attack that killed four Americans, and an attack on an Algerian oil field as examples of how splinter groups or individuals with jihadist sympathies can act, even without direction from higher in the terrorist chain, Clapper told the committee. Iran: Haven or prison for al Qaeda? 'Cyberespionage and cyberattacks' For the first time, the emphasis of Clapper's report was on cyberthreats, in the form of cyberattacks or cyberespionage. Already, foreign intelligence and security services have ""penetrated numerous computer networks"" in the United States belonging to the government and private sector alike, the report says. Although classified networks have been targeted, the majority of these attacks have involved unclassified networks, it states. The United States has enjoyed a technological edge over other nations, but advances in information technology and business practices are evening the playing field, according to the report. ""This is almost certainly allowing our adversaries to close the technological gap between our respective militaries, slowly neutralizing one of our key advantages in the international arena,"" it said. However, there is only a ""remote chance"" of a major cyberattack on the United State that would cause widespread disruptions, such as regional power outages, the report says. Most countries or groups don't have the capacity to pull it off. The report names China and Russia as two of the most ""advanced cyber actors,"" but says they are unlikely to launch an attack.

"(CNN) -- In his first executive order as Illinois governor, Pat Quinn established Friday the Illinois Reform Commission as an official state body under the governor's office. Illinois Gov. Pat Quinn wants a review of state government practices completed in 100 days. ""I think we are sending a message to the people of Illinois that we understand that integrity is No. 1 when it comes to the government of the Land of Lincoln,"" he said of his executive order. Quinn had set up the commission earlier this year when he was lieutenant governor under Rod Blagojevich, whom lawmakers impeached earlier this month and removed from office Thursday. His executive order ""formally establishes the Illinois Reform Commission under the auspices of the governor's office,"" he said at a news conference. The commission, led by former U.S. Attorney Patrick Collins, is an independent body that aims to evaluate existing Illinois law and practices in government, according to its Web site. It says it will release an initial report outlining its findings and recommendations in about 100 days. Quinn said there is ""an integrity crisis"" in Illinois. ""We're going to start to fumigate state government from top to bottom to make sure that it has no corruption,"" he said. The Illinois Senate on Thursday voted unanimously to remove impeached Blagojevich from office. A second vote, to prevent him from holding future state office, also passed unanimously.

"(CNN) -- Call it the ""mixed bag"" year for women in the midterm elections. A few high-profile women candidates got a lot of attention on the national stage, but with dramatic Democratic losses, the number of women in Congress will likely hold steady or decrease for the first time since 1987. The first female House Speaker, Nancy Pelosi, and three Democratic women committee chairs will lose their leadership positions in the majority, and consequently the overall political clout of women in the House will decrease. But not all the news for women in this election was bad. There were winners as well as losers -- and some groups were both. Republican women in Congress . Seven GOP newcomers in the House of Representatives match the previous record of seven in one election, and two more in still-undecided races could join them. In addition, a new Republican woman, Kelly Ayotte from New Hampshire, will join the Senate. Unfortunately, Republican women will occupy only about 10 percent of all Republican seats in the House. Many of the GOP women will lack seniority, especially with almost one-third of them newly elected, and few are likely to win leadership positions or committee chairs. The only Republican woman currently in leadership is Cathy McMorris Rodgers, vice chair of the Republican Conference. Unless Republicans take affirmative steps to promote women into leadership positions, the influence of Republican women in the 112th Congress will probably be very limited. In addition, Republican women candidates have had great difficulty surviving primaries. While a record number of Republican women ran in House primaries in 2010, only 37 percent won, a much lower proportion than the 68 percent of Democratic women who won their primaries. Women of color . Women of color made significant breakthroughs in this election. Two were elected governors: Nikki Haley of South Carolina is the first Indian-American woman and Susana Martinez of New Mexico the first Latina to head state governments. While the number of white Democratic women serving in the next Congress will decline, the number of Democratic women of color will increase. All four female Democrats newly elected to the 112th Congress are women of color: three African-Americans and one Asian-American. One new Republican woman of color, Jaime Herrera, a Latina, was elected to the House from Washington. Women in the headlines . Many women who received considerable national press attention in 2010 lost their races. The fanfare was of little help to Meg Whitman and Carly Fiorina in California, Sharron Angle in Nevada, Christine O'Donnell in Delaware, and Linda McMahon in Connecticut. Of the women candidates in the national limelight, only Nikki Haley prevailed, perhaps despite national media attention. Meanwhile, candidates who received far less attention, such as Martinez and Ayotte, emerged along with Haley as the real female stars of this election. Mama grizzlies . Some of the so-called ""mama grizzlies"" endorsed by Sarah Palin won while others lost. Palin's support for candidates brought no guarantee of election. All three of her female gubernatorial candidates in the general election -- Haley, Fallin, and Martinez -- won, but two of her favored gubernatorial candidates lost primaries in Wyoming and Georgia. Mama grizzlies running for the Senate fared less well, with three losing (O'Donnell, Angle, and Fiorina) and just one winning (Ayotte). Three of Palin's endorsed House candidates lost in primaries, but two-thirds of those who made it through to the general election won their races -- a strong showing. Sarah Palin and Hillary Clinton . For different reasons, Sarah Palin and Hillary Clinton, two women not on ballots in 2010, may have been among the biggest beneficiaries of this year's elections, with future presidential prospects enhanced. Although her mama grizzlies fared so-so in the elections, Palin, through her active involvement and candidate endorsements in 2010, increased her public visibility and perceived political clout. Perhaps even more important, governors in several states, including women in New Mexico, South Carolina and Oklahoma, will be beholden to her. They could be critical to a 2012 bid for the Republican nomination. Clearly, Palin's presidential prospects are stronger now than a year ago. If Sarah Palin benefited from being in the limelight in 2010, Hillary Clinton benefited by being absent from it. As Secretary of State, Clinton had no direct involvement in the elections and consequently remained above the fray as Democrats suffered losses of historic proportion, President Obama's popularity plunged, and both Obama and Vice President Biden appeared ineffectual at best in rallying voters behind Democratic candidates. Clinton remains popular, retaining her image as a strong and effective leader. Although it's unclear whether she will run for the presidency before 2016, if at all, Hillary Clinton in 2010 appears a stronger-than-ever potential contender.

"Washington (CNN) -- A man from Uzbekistan living in Alabama was sentenced Friday to almost 16 years in prison for threatening to kill President Barack Obama. Ulugbek Kodirov, 22, pleaded guilty in February to threatening Obama, providing material support for terrorism and for illegally possessing an automatic weapon. In his guilty plea, Kodirov said that in 2011 he was communicating with a person he thought was a member of the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan, a designated terrorist group, and that ""Kodirov interpreted these conversations to mean that he should kill President Obama,"" according to the Justice Department. Kodirov also admitted speaking to a different person in July 2011 about wanting to kill Obama and possible ways to carry out the act. Kodirov did not realize that person was a confidential source for law enforcement who then introduced Kodirov to someone to help him get weapons. The new contact was actually an undercover agent. The three men met in a motel room in Leeds, Alabama, on July 13, 2011, and the undercover agent showed Kodirov a machine gun, a sniper rifle with a telescopic sight and four disassembled hand grenades, and asked if he would like any of them to ""carry out his plan to kill the President."" Kodirov picked the machine gun and the hand grenades, according to the Justice Department. Kodirov took the weapons and left the meeting but was arrested by agents before he could get out of the building. Kodirov came to the United States on a student visa in June 2009, but failed to enroll in school. His visa was revoked in April 2010 and from then on he was in the country illegally.","Ulugbek Kodirov plotted to kill the president, the Justice Department says .

"Atlanta (CNN) -- International travelers, rejoice! The world's busiest airport is debuting a billion-dollar solution to the much-griped-about entry procedure for Atlanta-bound passengers. The screening hoops international travelers have long faced to escape the confines of Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport have led veteran traveler Nancy Megehee to avoid bringing anything more than a carry-on along on long-haul trips. Arriving back in Atlanta was just too much trouble. ""If you're going to walk the concourse, you have to clear your luggage to walk through. Typically, what I'm doing is carry-on, but I still have to go pick my bag up and have my bag re-examined by the TSA,"" Megehee said. That was one of the annoying quirks of an airport that handled nearly 10 million international passengers last year. Before May 16, even international travelers whose final destination was Atlanta had to pass through Transportation Security Administration checkpoints and recheck checked bags after clearing U.S. Customs and Border Protection to leave the airport. That's because there was no way to exit the international security zone to the outside world without crossing through the secure domestic terminal. All that duty-free fine wine had to get stuffed back into a traveler's luggage to avoid violating the TSA's 3-ounce rule. Then add a trip to the baggage claim to pick up checked bags before exiting. With Wednesday's opening of the Maynard H. Jackson International Terminal, six years later than planned and at a higher-than-expected cost of $1.4 billion, there will be much beyond the new ease of exiting to admire and celebrate: the natural light-filled structure, lovely views of airplanes taking off to foreign lands and taxiing to the new terminal gates, new retail and restaurant choices, art installations, a swanky new Delta Sky Club and technology charging areas that recognize the ubiquitous use of smartphones, laptops and other electronic devices. The logistics of getting to and from the terminal might present the biggest challenge. The new terminal is accessed via a different highway than the rest of the airport, and the city's rail service connects to the original terminal but not to the new international gateway. Shuttle buses will run around the clock to connect the old and new facilities. While we wait for international travelers to test Atlanta's newest terminal, we asked noted architects, airport operations executives and other travel industry experts to share what they look for in a world-class airport's design and features. An airport must nail down the basics: security, federal processing, technology, retail and restrooms, said Bill Fife, an airport consultant who has worked in positions with the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, including a role as deputy general manager of John F. Kennedy International Airport. Make security obvious and easy . Whether travelers are taking off from a home airport or landing in a foreign land for the first time without speaking the language, travelers want airports to make the process clear. Do they have time to get snacks before security, or will the security lines be too long and stressful? If they're landing for the first time in a foreign country and don't speak the language, do they know where to get their bags, clear customs and get to their hotel? ""People want to know where they're at, every step of the way,"" says Jason Clampet, senior online editor at Frommers.com. After Clampet flew into the Copenhagen Airport last fall, he noticed a big clock above security that showed how many minutes it would take to get people through the process. ""It said one minute, and I didn't believe them, but I was through security in 52 seconds,"" Clampet said. ""Whatever they said it was going to be, it was good to know. "" When airport architect Mark Leininger landed at Incheon International Airport in Seoul, South Korea, and went through security, he watched a video showing the procedure of showing one's passport to security, getting a picture taken and other details of the process. ""You want to make security seem like it's effective and people understand what they're doing, not just being treated like rats in rat maze,"" said Leininger, associate director of the architecture firm of Skidmore, Owings and Merrill, who has worked on Boston Logan International Airport and the current redesign for Delta's terminal at John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York. Reducing the stress of flying . Cramped security spaces, lack of light and too much noise can contribute to an already-stressful flying experience, where travelers often have to remove much of their clothing in public before being allowed to head to their respective gates. ""You're often in an absolutely lightless space with low ceilings, and usually the occupancy rates are in excess of what the building's mechanical systems would allow,"" said architect Simon Smithson, who worked on Madrid Barajas Airport's Terminal 4 project. The use of natural light, enormous windows to show people where they're heading (to the plane or to customs) and acoustics to dampen the sound of thousands of travelers and workers can contribute to a nicer flying experience, said Smithson, project architect on the Madrid airport and a partner at the architecture firm of Rogers Stirk Harbour + Partners in London. ""We designed a nice, generous space with some sort of natural light so people would see how the process is working,"" Smithson said. ""We also used light to let people inside the building know the time of day outside."" That helps fliers landing in a different time zone to reorient their body clocks. Get me something to eat . Many travelers heading to foreign ports are too squeezed for time to pack their own snacks, and some want more than the usual fast food options that will just sit in their stomachs on a 10-hour flight. Careful placement of restaurants with seating and to-go options along the walk to a traveler's gate can minimize the stress that hunger will cause. Some winners: Fife applauds the design at the JetBlue terminal at Kennedy Airport, noting that customers can pick from many options and pay at the same registers. Frequent traveler Charles Kunz loves the local restaurant options at the San Francisco airport's international terminal. Let me use my technology . With the proliferation of smartphones, laptops and iPads for work and pleasure, customers are using technology to check into their flights, check on gate locations and flight delays, and play or work while waiting for their flights. That puts more pressure on airports to supply outlets for people to keep charging their devices. ""It's clear that connectivity is just a huge issue,"" said Chris Oswald, Airport Council International-North America's vice president of operations. ""If you have to go plug into an outlet outside the bathroom down the hall, that's not the level of service you want."" Some airports have added outlet trees placed in seating areas, while others have added power strips in the seats themselves, he said. ""It's absolutely something you have to have."" Connect to public transportation . Many frequent international travelers appreciate airports that are easily accessed by public transportation. Architect Anthony Mosellie loves flying out of Hong Kong International Airport. Mosellie, a principal at Kohn Pedersen Fox Associates and head of its airport practice, simply boards a train in central Hong Kong that takes him directly to the airport. ""The train doors open, and I walk 10 or 15 yards, and I'm right in the airport terminal."" Clampet has a similar experience landing in Vancouver. ""The train just zips right downtown,"" he said. ""You know you're being taken care of all the way as opposed to being on the edge of town and taking a taxi and not knowing if you're being ripped off."" A change in attitude . Kunz, who runs an independent car rental company in Durham, North Carolina, wants U.S Customs and Border Protection to make people coming home or visiting the United States feel welcome. He echoed the complaints of many U.S. travelers: They say they often feel presumed guilty upon arrival back home in the United States. It's an attitude they say they don't get when arriving in other airports around the world. ""You know you have nothing in your bags, and yet you feel guilty,"" said Kunz, who took part in a recent simulation to test the systems at Atlanta's new terminal. ""I know they see a million people a day, but I only see one (of them) that day. It's fun to come back home. If they could just say 'welcome back,' that would help add a human touch."" And it's not just about manners. International tourist arrivals to the United States are projected to grow 36% between 2010 and 2020, according to the U.S. Travel Association, and those visits contribute to the U.S. economy. The association advocates fully staffing customs desks to match international arrival schedules and expanding the U.S. Customs and Border Protection's Global Entry Trusted Traveler Network to include more trusted international travelers. (Currently, U.S. residents and citizens of a few test countries are eligible to apply for membership.) ""People are coming here and spending thousands of dollars and leaving with a better impression of the United States than when they came in,"" said Cathy Keefe, USTA spokeswoman. ""How are they treated when they arrive in the United States?"" she asked. ""It's their first impression when they come into the United States. We can have a standard welcome message and still maintain security."" Which international airports have you flown through? What do you like or dislike about them? Tell us in the comments section below.","New international terminal opens Wednesday in Atlanta .

"(CNN) -- A preliminary autopsy Thursday did not reveal any identifying information on remains found on the bank of a river, less than 30 miles from the homes of two missing Illinois women. Partial skeletal remains were found on the south bank of the Des Plaines River near Channahon, Illinois. The ""partial skeletal remains"" were found on the south bank of the Des Plaines River near Channahon, Illinois, according to Will County Coroner Patrick O'Neil's office. A statement issued by O'Neil's office said a forensic examination was inconclusive as to identity, race or sex of the body parts, which consisted of a rib cage, spinal column and partial left and right femur bones. A marine cleanup crew, which discovered the remains Wednesday, also found shreds of blue jeans and a small amount of money. The Illinois State Police Forensic Crime Laboratory is expediting a DNA analysis, which will take at least two weeks, the statement said. Illinois State Police were on the scene Thursday conducting additional searches, said spokesman Sgt. Tom Burek. On Sunday, Michelle Williams found a blue barrel in Channahon, Illinois, along the river and called police.  Watch Williams describe her grisly find Â» . Channahon is 20 miles from Bolingbrook, Illinois, where Stacy Peterson lived with her husband, former police officer Drew Peterson. The former officer's stepbrother told police he helped Drew Peterson move a heavy blue barrel shortly after his wife's disappearance  police uncover skeletal remains Â» . Williams said she didn't initially make any connection regarding the barrel, but she did call police. ""It wasn't until yesterday afternoon when the news broke that there had been skeletal remains washing up on shore and that far away from the blue barrel, I had a sick feeling to my stomach when I heard that,"" Williams told CNN's Nancy Grace. Stacy Peterson disappeared in October 2007. Her husband has been named a suspect in her disappearance, but he has maintained his innocence, saying she left him for another man. Stacy Peterson, 23 when she was last seen, was Drew Peterson's fourth wife. This month, Drew Peterson, 55, was indicted on murder charges in the 2004 death of his third wife, Kathleen Savio, while the two were in the midst of a nasty divorce. He has pleaded not guilty. Savio's death was originally deemed an accident, but authorities took a second look at the case after Stacy Peterson's disappearance. Channahon is also 15 miles from Plainfield, Illinois, where Lisa Stebic was last seen in April 2007. On the day she went missing, she petitioned a court to have her husband, Craig, evicted from their Plainfield home. Craig Stebic told police he was working in the backyard when his 37-year-old wife left home about 6 p.m., taking her cell phone and purse. Authorities have said they believe that Lisa Stebic was the victim of foul play and have named Craig Stebic a suspect. CNN's Kara Devlin contributed to this report.","NEW: Rib cage, spinal column and partial left femur bones among body parts found .

"Des Moines, Iowa (CNN) -- A visit to the Iowa State Fair is a test of diet discipline: They fry just about everything -- from Oreos to butter to mac & cheese -- and the bigger the better, from half-pound tenderloins to massive turkey legs and pork chops. Not much changes from year to year. There's the butter cow, nightly entertainment at the grandstand, arcade games and amusement rides. But the ""Cast Your Kernel"" booth, while hardly a scientific enterprise, offers a big hint of change from the last presidential year: With more than 30,000 kernels cast, Mitt Romney is leading President Barack Obama.Iowa, the scene of a 10-point Obama blowout in 2008, is a 2012 presidential battleground. Obama stopped by the fair during his three-day Iowa bus tour this week. And the Romney campaign chose the fair for the solo debut of Rep. Paul Ryan, the GOP vice presidential pick. ""We have a real battle going on here for the heart and soul of the people of this state,"" GOP Gov. Terry Branstad says during an early afternoon walk through the fairgrounds. ""President Obama had a tremendous following here four years ago,"" Branstad says in making the GOP's case. ""But people feel betrayed. They feel like he ran as someone who was going to bring people together and reach across the aisle and he hasn't done that."" Branstad is both a throwback and part of an Iowa Republican revival: He was governor for 16 years, left office, and then decided to run again in 2010, when the Midwest was a big part of the midterm GOP rout. Four years ago, Democrats enjoyed a significant numbers advantage in Iowa. Now, there is parity -- even a slight GOP edge in the latest active voter registration tally. ""Have you been outhustled here?"" is the question we put to top Obama political strategist David Axelrod as he traveled with the president this week. Axelrod was quick to offer a tip of the cap to Branstad and the Iowa Republican Party for their aggressive work the past few years, but he voiced confidence the Obama campaign was stepping up its grass-roots organizing. ""I think we still have an organizational advantage in this state,"" Axelrod says. ""We've done a good job of registering new voters so I think we are building that back up. But I don't think we are going to be outhustled on Election Day."" The urgency is obvious when you stop by a local Obama campaign office. In Davenport this week, for example, everyone in line for tickets to one of the president's rallies was asked if they were registered voters. Those who said no were immediately handed a clipboard with the registration form, and volunteers -- knowing anyone not registered by now might be unreliable come Election Day -- suggested they also sign up to vote by mail, which allows the campaign to follow-up and witness the process. You don't need to visit the fair or a campaign office to understand 2012 is different from 2008. Just turn on the television. The TV ad war is bruising, and unavoidable -- $6 million spent just in Iowa in the last month. The Obama campaign outspent the Romney campaign more than 2-1 in the past month in Iowa. But the TV ad war scales tip back in favor of Romney and the GOP when spending by the political parties and super PACs is factored in. Iowa is a great test of the Ryan Factor. The president's team says his policy views -- on Medicare, on a new long-term farm bill and on renewable energy subsidies -- will in the end trump any short-term bounce from his campaign skills and Midwest roots. ""He may hail from Wisconsin,"" Axelrod says in the interview, ""but he is very much a product of the right-wing Washington think tanks. And that vision is not a good vision for this country."" Branstad, in turn, calls the Ryan pick ""brilliant"" and, a Catholic himself, predicts having a Catholic as the No. 2 on the GOP ticket will help with a critical voting bloc here, especially in the Northeast corner of the state. Plus, Branstad says Iowa voters rank the federal deficit higher than jobs as an election priority -- and says Ryan is in tune with their worries about annual deficits and long-term debt. ""You cannot increase the deficit, the debt, a trillion dollars every year and have 40 cents of every dollar you spend be borrowed money,"" Branstad says. Branstad also says he is confident of what you might call a reverse-coattails effect: He says Republicans are competitive in each of the state's congressional districts this year, and suggests that will help with the presidential margins in traditionally Democratic areas like Des Moines and surrounding Polk County. Democrats take a not-so-fast approach to that dynamic -- promising to make the Ryan budget, particularly its Medicare proposals, an issue in every House race here and beyond. Branstad acknowledged the potential power of the issue, especially in an older state like Iowa, but predicted it would not hurt the GOP provided Romney and Ryan used every opportunity to rebut the attacks and explain their proposals. ""It's going to be close,"" Branstad says of the state, making note of the heavy commitment of candidate time, staff and spending both campaigns are making to Iowa. That includes busy booths just a few steps away from each other at the fair, where both campaigns are helping to register voters and recruit volunteers. Branstad, whose involvement in presidential politics goes back more than a quarter-century, smiles at all the activity -- and attention. ""It's fun,"" the governor says, ""to be a battleground state."" Axelrod, who also traveled with Vice President Joe Biden the last time he came to Iowa, says the state and its six electoral votes could prove decisive. ""John, my philosophy is always to plan for the worst and hope for the best,"" Axelrod says. ""And so we're planning for 270 electoral votes (the minimum for victory). In that scenario, even a smaller state like Iowa can be a pivotal state. And that's why we're spending three days here. We're not leaving anything to chance. We're fighting for every vote and every electoral vote. And these electoral votes matter.""","President Obama won Iowa in a 10-point blowout in 2008; this year it could go either way .

"(CNN) -- The White House is running out of time, and ideas, for turning the economy around before the fall elections. Almost three years into recovery, the U.S. economy added only 80,000 jobs in June, marking its third consecutive month of poor job growth. The Wall Street Journal noted that the United States gained just 225,000 jobs in the past three months combined, making it the weakest quarter of job growth since the labor market began to recover in 2010. The unemployment rate, still 8.2%, has been stuck above 8% for 41 straight months, the longest streak since the Great Depression. A government report found that 85,000 Americans left the workforce in June to enroll in the Social Security Disability Insurance program. That means that more workers joined the federal government's disability program in June than got new jobs. How did the White House respond to the anemic report? ""There are no quick fixes to the problems we face that were more than a decade in the making,"" Alan Krueger, chairman of the President's Council of Economic Advisers, said in a written statement. In other words, any chances for economic recovery before the fall elections look slim. More importantly, there is a profound lack of urgency from the White House for any large scale, serious reforms. In fact, Krueger went on to claim the economy really isn't as bad as we think. ""The economy has now added private sector jobs for 28 straight months, for a total of 4.4 million payroll jobs during that period,"" he said. The obvious problem here is that Obama has been president for more than 40 months. The White House conveniently blames Republicans for decades of lost jobs, but forgets to mention the United States lost 4.3 million jobs in President Obama's first 13 months in office. Krueger concluded, ""[I]t is important not to read too much into any one monthly report and it is informative to consider each report in the context of other data that are becoming available."" This isn't the first time the White House has used this excuse. In fact, the Romney campaign was quick to put together a list of the 30 times the White House has used this same excuse, dating back to November 2009. Is the White House perhaps telling us something more significant: that we shouldn't read too much into the entire term of Barack Obama's presidency? In Ohio on Friday, Obama excused the jobs report by again claiming he inherited the worst economy since the Great Depression. He added that the jobs report is ""a step in the right direction"" and that ""it's still tough out there."" The president appears intellectually and ideologically spent, and it's not just Republicans saying that. Robert Reich, former Secretary of Labor in the Clinton administration, wrote recently, ""[T]he excuse is wearing thin. It's his economy now, and most voters don't care what he inherited."" He added, ""[H]e has to show he understands the depth and breadth of this crisis."" It's not so clear the president does. On Monday, he again called to repeal the Bush tax cuts on the highest earners, a contentious partisan issue that the public knows will not be solved before the elections. In his weekly address he continued to push for more construction projects and increased financial aid for college students. Even to Keynesian economists on the left these are hardly bold policies a party can rally behind. The economy is shaping up to be the most important factor of the 2012 elections, yet the president seems content to rest his re-election chances on worn-out, recycled policy proposals and ad hominem attacks on Mitt Romney. It's hard to see how this is a winning strategy. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of William Bennett.","William Bennett: U.S. economy continues to experience poor job growth .

"Baghdad, Iraq (CNN) -- Four massive explosions -- at least one set off by a suicide bomber -- rocked a busy area of Baghdad on Thursday. The blasts came in quick succession around 1 p.m. not far from the fortified area known as the Green Zone, where international and government employees work. Black smoke filled the sky as fires raged for nearly two hours and frantic Iraqis shouted out for their loved ones. One woman screamed, ""My son!"" At least 18 people were killed and 53 were wounded, police officials in Baghdad told CNN. In one of the attacks, a suicide bomber detonated an explosives-laden vest inside the Justice Ministry building, Iraqi security officials told CNN. Iraqi state television reported that three gunmen rushed into the building, but Iraqi forces killed them. Iraqi forces continued to search the building to make sure employees were safe, the government-run news outlet said. It's unclear at this time how the bomber and gunmen were able to get to the Justice Ministry, considering there are multiple checkpoints and other security measures in place to help keep the high-traffic area secure. A two-year college nearby was also damaged. Three hours after the blasts, Iraqi military helicopters were still hovering over the Justice Ministry as the sounds of sirens wailed.

"(CNN) -- Motley Crue singer Vince Neil checked out of a Sydney, Australia, hospital less than a day after surgery to remove kidney stones that forced a quick end to a Sunday concert, his manager said Monday.

"(CNN) -- The rats die hard in Iran. Sharpshooters in Tehran are training their air gun scopes on the country's longstanding rodent problem. Rats are reportedly running rampant in 26 districts in the capital. Iran has the biggest beef with Norwegian rats, Mohammad Hadi Heydarzadeh, a top environmental official, told CNN. He said the critters have ""entered Iran from abroad by cargo ships."" Though it's unclear if the rats come with paperwork, a search of ratbehavior.org shows that that particular kind of rat can grow 16 inches long. And they are very aggressive, ""fighting, chasing, biting and boxing."" While the Iranians have used poison to kill the rats during the daytime, at night the teams of sharpshooters use infrared lenses to hunt them down. ""We have identified the rats' places of congregation by using (computer) software,"" Heydarzadeh explained. By the end of 2013, the Iranians hope to have 40 teams of shooters working, he added. So far, 2,205 rats have been killed. Their bodies are carted off and incinerated or buried in special dumps, the environmental official explained. University researchers are working with the government to assess whether their newest plan of attack is working. But Heydarzadeh feels good.

"(CNN) -- ""Can we trust that politician?"" Typically, that's the question we ask when assessing a political candidate. But with Mitt Romney, I think the question should go the other way around: Does he trust us? And there's a lot of evidence that he does not. Why else would Romney be so guarded? So afraid to open up to us about who he really is? Romney doesn't want to talk about the details of his work at Bain Capital -- the private equity firm he ran for 15 years. He's reticent to talk about his faith. He won't offer us details about various policy positions despite fellow Republicans urging him to do so. And the biggest sign of his lack of trust is his refusal to release more than two years of his income tax returns. Maybe it's not us. Perhaps Romney just has ""trust issues."" I'm not a psychologist, and my sister, who is one, has made it clear I know nothing about this field. (We can just chalk that up to sibling rivalry.) But you don't have to be Dr. Phil (or my sister) to sense intuitively that Romney is an extremely private, risk-adverse individual. He is so standoffish, he makes John Kerry look like Will Smith. His reserve might be fine in the corporate boardroom where you're judged primarily on the company's bottom line. But when you are running for president, likability is important -- even more than policy positions for some voters. And on a purely human level, it's hard to like a person if you don't feel like you know him or her because that person is intentionally keeping something from you. In the absence of information, it's natural to sense there is a less than positive reason for the evasive behavior. Opinion: Why Mitt Romney is losing . The consequences of Romney's holding back can be seen in two polls released this week. The first, released Wednesday by ABC News/Washington Post, found that only 40% of Americans view him favorably -- in contrast with President Barack Obama who maintains a 53% favorability rating. And worse, Romney is viewed unfavorably by 49% of Americans -- an increase of a whopping 18 percentage points since the beginning of this year. And a CNN/ORC International poll released Thursday finds Obama has opened up a seven-point lead over Romney. If Romney wants to win this election, he needs to trust us -- to stop keeping things from us and tell us who he is as a person, not a politician. And he had a great chance to do just this at the NAACP Convention in July when he told the audience: ""I believe that if you understood who I truly am in my heart ... you would vote for me for president."" This was Romney's moment to tell us what is in his heart. Instead, he proceeded to recite his generic stump speech. Like Ebenezer Scrooge waking up on Christmas morning realizing he still has chance to right his life, so does Romney. He should immediately release his past tax returns for at least three or four years. Polls show that a majority of Americans want him to do just that --- just like so many other presidential candidates have in the past, including his father who ran for the 1968 Republican presidential nomination and released a dozen years of tax returns. The likely reason Romney won't release the past returns is fear. And that's not based on something I learned in Psychology 101. It's what Ann Romney -- his wife -- stated during an interview with ABC News in July. There, she said that if they released additional tax returns, the information contained in them would be used to attack Mitt. She is 100% correct on that one. Both sides in this race will use anything and everything against each other. Romney saw this happen firsthand during the Republican presidential primaries when he released a tax return. His fellow Republicans immediately pounced on the low rate of taxes he paid. But here is where trust comes in. Romney has to trust that we know the difference between political BS and real issues. While the Obama campaign will attack Romney's return, it does not mean most Americans will be swayed by it. Plus Mitt needs to understand this about the average American: We are more concerned with what taxes we are paying, not what the Romneys paid. Romney may find want to heed the advice of the Chinese philosopher, Lao Tzu, who stated: ""He who does not trust enough, will not be trusted."" Romney needs to show some faith in us. Let us in to see who he really is -- flaws and all. Opening up could just be the thing that propels him to victory in November. Or Romney can simply remain guarded and closed off -- leaving us with the question: If Mitt doesn't trust us, why should we trust him?

"(CNN) -- Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan hit the campaign trail Thursday to pitch energy policy and defense spending, as new polls showed President Barack Obama maintaining a slight lead in three key swing states after Romney named the conservative House Budget Committee chairman as his running mate. Four days ahead of the Republican National Convention, certain presidential nominee Romney sought to build momentum with a continued focus on his economic policies mixed with attacks on Obama's handling of a stalling recovery. However, the controversy this week over Republican Rep. Todd Akin's incendiary remarks on ""legitimate"" rape and pregnancy has dominated the political chatter and raised questions about whether the conservative Christian from suburban St. Louis can unseat vulnerable Democratic Sen. Claire McCaskill in Missouri. Threat against Akin being investigated . Seeking to regain control of the campaign message, Romney traveled to New Mexico to discuss a plan that he says will make America energy independent by 2020 -- which would coincide with the conclusion of his second presidential term, if he gets elected twice. Touting the country's newly accessible oil and gas reserves, Romney repeated familiar themes -- fewer federal regulations, more oil drilling -- that he said would wean the country off imported oil and spark an economic boom at home. Democrats: Our convention will stall Romney . He called for states to have control over drilling on federal land within their borders; opening new offshore areas to energy development; starting a fast-track approval process for energy projects including nuclear power, and limiting the ability of environmental groups to file lawsuits. Acknowledging that conventional sources of oil were dwindling, Romney said the new production would come from places like the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, Canada's oil sands and shale formations. CNN electoral map: Do the math . In a position paper on the issue, Romney listed benefits from achieving energy independence as 3 million new jobs, $1 trillion in government revenues, a stronger dollar and lower energy prices. However, a recent report by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office was less sanguine. The CBO report, which was requested by Ryan, said 70% of the nation's oil and gas reserves already were available for drilling. Opening the rest, it said, would increase government receipts from an estimated $150 billion under current policy to $175 billion to $200 billion over the next 10 years. Strippers count on GOP spending . When asked to explain the difference, a Romney staffer said the campaign's projections were more inclusive and stretched out over a longer time period. Obama has touted increased oil production in recent years, and also opened up new areas for drilling in the Gulf of Mexico and indicated he'll issue permits to drill in the Arctic. Obama's troubled solar 'poster boy' At the same time, the administration has increased environmental and safety standards for offshore drilling and tightened emissions rules on power plants. The current administration has also issued fewer permits for drilling than George W. Bush, largely due to the moratorium imposed after the BP spill in 2010. On Thursday, Romney criticized Obama's support for renewable energy subsidies and highlighted companies that have received government funding and then gone bankrupt, such as Solyndra and Ener1. Wal-Mart moms not tipping their hand . The administration has repeatedly defended its decision to invest in renewable energy companies, noting that energy from wind and solar projects have doubled since Obama took office. ""The Republican approach is essentially one that is written by or dictated by big oil and it focuses almost entirely on oil and fossil fuels,"" White House Press Secretary Jay Carney said Thursday. Romney has said he would not support extending the federal subsidy for wind power, which expires at the end of the year. He called Thursday for the government to support advanced energy development at the basic research level, not at the commercialization phase. Ryan, meanwhile, spoke about about military spending at a defense industry roundtable in Fayetteville, North Carolina. The event came a day after a new CBO report outlined the potentially dismal impact of the impending ""fiscal cliff"" that includes the expiration of the Bush tax cuts and mandatory reductions in government spending, including defense outlays. Ron Paul, supporters change strategy . The scheduled automatic cuts -- known as sequestration -- came about as a result of a compromise budget measure passed into law after congressional negotiations failed to agree on a deficit-reduction plan last year. Ryan voted for the compromise, saying at the time that it represented ""a victory for those committed to controlling government spending and growing our economy."" Show us your budget, Ryan demands . Now, he and Romney call the looming ""fiscal cliff"" an example of Obama's failed leadership. Democrats, however, blame what they call Republican intransigence in opposing Obama's push to extend the Bush tax cuts only for income over $250,000 a year for families and $200,000 a year for individuals. ""Under a Mitt Romney administration, this will not happen,"" Ryan said of the automatic cuts to military spending. ""We will reverse these reckless, devastating defense cuts that the president is bringing us toward."" At the White House, Carney said a quick solution to the issue would come if Republicans ease their rigid opposition to ending tax cuts for wealthy Americans. Rick Warren cancels presidential forum . The new Quinnipiac University/CBS News/New York Times polls showed Obama leading Romney by 49%-46% in Florida and 49%-47% in Wisconsin, which is Ryan's home state. Both results were within the margin of error, meaning the races are statistically even in those states. In Ohio, the poll showed Obama with a 50%-44% lead, just outside the sampling margin of error. Peter A. Brown, assistant director of Quinnipiac University Polling Institute, wrote in a statement accompanying the polls' release that Romney's choice of Ryan has made ""small difference"" so far in the race. Will money be the difference maker? In Florida, support for Romney ticked up 1 percentage point from a poll taken before Ryan was added to the ticket. In Wisconsin, Romney inched up 2 percentage points. The Ohio numbers remained identical to a Quinnipiac University survey taken prior to the Ryan announcement. With a potential hurricane possibly heading toward Tampa, Florida, the site of the Republican convention scheduled to begin Monday, GOP officials made clear Thursday that Romney would be nominated as the party's presidential candidate next week regardless of whether the storm disrupts proceedings. ""We do have contingency plans to deal with weather related and other circumstances that may occur to ensure that the business can go on at the RNC and Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan will become our nominees,"" RNC communications director Sean Spicer told CNN. Isaac gains strength by the mile . ""While the safety of delegates and others attending next week's Republican National Convention was paramount, the actual business of nominating Romney would not be delayed by bad weather,"" Spicer said, adding: ""There are contingency plans in place and rules of the RNC in place that ensure that will always be able to occur."" The storm's path is uncertain, though some computer models show it could move up through Florida, including Tampa. Other models send it farther west, into the Gulf of Mexico. According to the latest forecast map from the National Hurricane Center in Miami, the storm -- named Isaac -- will pass near the Florida Keys early Monday as a Category 1 hurricane and northwest of Tampa by Monday evening. The convention is scheduled to run through Thursday evening when Romney will officially accept the nomination and deliver his acceptance speech. The speech is considered a crucial moment for any presidential nominee because many voters are just beginning to tune in to the presidential election. Arrest made after threat to Obama . Neither Obama nor Vice President Joe Biden have any campaign events scheduled Thursday. A new Obama campaign ad released Thursday features former President Bill Clinton -- in increasingly visible surrogate for Obama. In the ad, Clinton attempts to draw a contrast between Republicans and Democrats as the November election approaches. Whither Sarah Palin? ""This is a clear choice. The Republican plan is to cut more taxes on upper income people and go back to deregulation. That's what got us in trouble in the first place,"" Clinton says in the ad. ""President Obama has a plan to rebuild America from the ground up, investing in innovation, education, and job training. It only works if there is a strong middle class."" He later adds: ""That's what happened when I was president. We need to keep going with his plan."" In his stump speeches, Obama frequently credits Clinton-era policies for the strong economy in the 1990s. CNN's Tom Cohen, Paul Steinhauser, Dana Davidsen, Kevin Liptak, Gregory Wallace, Ashley Killough and CNNMoney's Jeanne Sahadi contributed to this report.","NEW: Romney calls for more oil drilling, less regulation .

"(CNN) -- Tuesday's election marks the end of an epic, historic campaign season that included witches, rallies for sanity, the Tea Party and a journalist handcuffed by a campaign. From Meg Whitman to Harry Reid to Joe Miller, candidates have spent more than ever, fought more than ever, and given us an election cycle of firsts. But there is another first no one is really talking about: the surge of Iraq and Afghanistan veterans running this year. On Tuesday, 27 veterans of Iraq and Afghanistan will seek national office. This is nearly four times the number of veterans of those wars currently serving in Congress. Twenty-five are campaigning for House seats and two are running for the Senate. Eighteen are running as Republicans, nine as Democrats. They are as ideologically diverse as the electorate they hope to represent and share only one agenda item: their desire to continue their service. This wave of veterans -- The New Vet 27 -- is the beginning of a much larger movement developing in American politics and society. They represent the next greatest generation of troops, who are committed to serving our country long after they get home from war. Whether they win or lose in their campaigns, for those of us who have served, their initiative is inspiring, especially after a decade of war during which recent veterans have often been portrayed as either villains or victims. They are a dynamic group of young men -- unfortunately, no female veterans of Iraq or Afghanistan are running in this cycle -- who are familiar with a little crossfire. They definitely know how to fight back when attacked. And their bios read like something out of a movie. Tommy Sowers, Duncan Hunter Jr., Adam Kinzinger and Joe Sestak are just a few in this wave. Sowers served two tours in Iraq as a Green Beret, taught at West Point, and is running for Congress in Missouri in Rush Limbaugh's home district. Hunter served as a Marine in both Iraq and Afghanistan and is up for re-election to Congress in a part of California with a huge concentration of active duty troops. Kinzinger, an Air Force pilot renowned for saving a Milwaukee, Wisconsin, woman from a knife-wielding attacker, returned from his third deployment to Iraq in May 2009 and is running to represent a congressional district in Illinois. And three-star Navy Adm. Joe Sestak is trading in his command of a carrier battle group supporting combat operations in Iraq and Afghanistan for an opportunity to tackle the Senate representing Pennsylvania. On the front lines, The New Vet 27 served to a different degree than 99 percent of Americans. They saw firsthand the enormous cost of America's decision to send young men and women to war. They were tested, they served with honor -- and they survived. Now, they're ready to put their military values and skills to use in a new kind of battle. As veterans, they know the ramifications of foreign policy decisions, the struggles for quality health care coverage, and the challenges of getting a college education. They also know how to make tough decisions under pressure. And they are looking for that next mission that allows them to keep serving. They represent new blood, but they're not the first generation to make this transition. Our democracy is rooted in this historical precedent. Since George Washington first set aside his rank of general to seek office, declaring ""When we assumed the soldier, we did not lay aside the citizen,"" veterans have long been part of a tradition of political service in this country. World War II and Korea created a wave in Washington, as many former warriors used the GI Bill to earn their college education and transition into public service. John F. Kennedy, George H. W. Bush, John Warner, Daniel Akaka, Robert Dole, Max Cleland, John Murtha, John Kerry, James Webb and John McCain are just a few of the veterans in our nation's recent history who carried their oath to serve from combat to Capitol Hill. But The New Vet 27 hoping to take the oath of office comes at a critical juncture for our country. The American public has never been more disconnected from the costs and consequences of war. And Washington is no exception. Despite the nation being immersed in two wars, the veteran ranks on Capitol Hill are rapidly disappearing. Many World War II and Korea vets have died or retired, and there are only three Vietnam vets currently serving in the Senate (McCain, Webb and Kerry). After Tuesday's election, there is a significant likelihood veterans will hold less than a fifth of the seats in Congress -- a sharp contrast from 1969, when veterans held a record 75 percent of the seats in the wake of World War II and Korea. When polls close this week, The New Vet 27 might not all capture seats, but they do represent an important sign of things to come for our country. And troops thousands of miles away in Iraq and Afghanistan will have an eye on them. After Tuesday, there is no telling how many of the 2.1 million troops deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan, as of June 2010, will end up in Congress in the years to come. But if history is any guide, the country should expect quite a few. And likely one or two in the White House. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Paul Rieckhoff.","Paul Rieckhoff: On Tuesday 27 vets of Iraq and Afghanistan will seek seats in Congress .
