"Luscious, long and glossy are all adjectives frequently deployed to describe the Duchess of Cambridge's hair, as are beautiful and glamorous. Now the Duke of Cambridge has added another one to the list - nightmare. William made the joke about Kate's locks during a private visit to the homeless charity Centrepoint. Chatting to a trainee hairdresser named Angel during a mentoring session, the second-in-line to the throne quipped that she should try styling Kate's 'nightmare hair'. 'Nightmare'! Prince William said his wife's hair is a 'nightmare' during a visit to Centrepoint this morning . The moment came during a visit to Centrepoint's health and wellbeing centre in Soho, central London, for a breakfast. In addition to the encounter with Angel, the Duke also met business volunteers and young homeless people being helped by the charity. While it might not always meet with William's approval, the Duchess is famous for her glossy locks, which are tended by hairdresser Amanda Cook Tucker. Ms Cook Tucker was among the entourage that travelled with the Cambridges when they flew to New York earlier this month. She is also widely believed to be responsible for Kate's increasingly glamorous style, including the succession of chic up-do's worn in recent months. Gorgeous: Kate's locks have been described as many things but nightmare has not previously been used . On her travels: The Duchess' hairdresser Amanda Cook Tucker travelled with the couple to New York . Sweet tooth: Although he was supposed to be learning about healthy eating, William displayed a sweet tooth . Supporter: William has long been a supporter of Centrepoint and often champions homeless charities . All together: William has been part of the Centrepoint team since 2005 and is a regular visitor to its centres . The Duke, who was without his wife for the event, also joined in a healthy breakfast session where young people were learning about nutritional food. But it appears the Duke might have been more interested in the treats on offer as Centrepoint tweeted that William has a 'sweet tooth' and included the hashtag #whoateallthechocolate. As patron of Centrepoint, William takes a keen interest in its work and since taking up the post in 2005 has toured a number of its facilities and centres. Seyi Obakin, Centrepoint’s chief executive, said: 'The Duke of Cambridge’s visit provided a huge boost for all the young people he met ahead of Christmas, which for them can be a difficult and emotional time. 'Fortunately for many vulnerable young people staying with us in London, Sunderland and Bradford, while they won’t have their families around them, they will have Centrepoint. Glamorous: The Duchess of Cambridge has opted for a series of glamorous up-dos in recent months . All smiles: The Duchess took part in a charity event of her own last night, joining young Beavers in Bow . Campaign: The Duchess was there to help launch the Scout Association's Better Prepared campaign . 'We estimate that 15,000 young people will face homelessness alone this Christmas. Whether they’re exposed to the elements or moving from one floor or sofa to another, the futures of these young people are at risk. Homeless young people are twice as likely to die as their peers. 'We must ensure that, wherever they are, young people have the vital support they need to leave homelessness behind.' The visit came less than 24 hours after the Duchess stepped out on behalf of another charity, joining Beavers in East London for a gathering last night. There, Kate, who was unusually dressed down in a hoodie and black J Brand jeans, spent the evening helping children aged between five and eight earn their disability awareness badges. In order to get them, they - and the Duchess - had to ice a cake blindfolded and learn the Scout promise in sign language. The visit, at the Old Ford Primary School in Bow, was intended to highlight the Scout Association's new campaign, Better Prepared, which is designed to increase the number of Scout and Beaver groups nationwide. Challenge: The Duchess took part in several challenges, including icing a cake blindfolded . Volunteer: Kate, who helped out with local Scouts during her time in Wales, joins in the fun . Low key: The Duchess chose an unusually relaxed ensemble of a Scout hoodie and J Brand jeans .","The Duke of Cambridge made the comments during a charity visit .

"A pair of classic leather shoes is an ideal, time-tested Christmas gift for a British gent. But look closely at the stack heels of cobbler Oliver Sweeney's new designs as each one conceals a tiny bottle of Johnnie Walker Red Label Scotch. The smart Oxford-style shoes are the world's first brogues to hide miniature bottles of whisky  and at £295, are the latest designer gift for the man who has everything. Scroll down for video . Oliver Sweeney's tan Oxford-style brogues conceal miniature bottles of whisky in suede-lined compartments . There are only 130 pairs made by the British men's footwear and accessories label. Each pair took two days to make out of calf leather and feature the initials 'JW' stitched on the back of the shoe. The stitching, the inner sole and the shoes' dust bag is all red to reflect the signature colour of the blend while the leather is tanned the same shade as the Scotch. Each of the  brogues, with their signature hole-punched patterns, feature the iconic Johnnie Walker 'striding man' tattooed directly on to the leather of the heel. The only suggestion that there's a bottle of the strong stuff hidden in a suede-lined recess in the stacked heel comes from the metal screwtop peeping out of its hidden compartment. Buyers will also receive a bottle of ginger ale and a recipe card to make the new cocktail Johnnie and Ginger, which combines one part whisky, three parts ginger ale and a wedge of lime over ice. Oliver Sweeney and Johnnie Walker Red Label whisky collaborated to create the limited edition footwear . The Johnnie Walker Oliver Sweeney Brogues are part of the whisky's Bold Collections project, a series of ventures combining drinks and design. Oliver Sweeney's Cobbler-In-Chief, Tim Cooper, described the partnership between the shoemakers and the classic Scotch as 'a fun project which we've been absolutely passionate about perfecting.' He said: 'Always obsessing over detail and the best construction methods, we take our time to select the right materials and components to give you real quality and distinctive style.' The design sees the signature Red Label colours feature in the stitching, inner sole and dust bag . He said the partnership with Johnnie Walker feels like 'the perfect fit' and added, 'we hope you enjoy our amusing take on a style classic'. A spokesperson for Johnnie Walker said: 'We are hugely excited to work with Oliver Sweeney, an iconic brand which is renowned for its craftsmanship and bold style. 'Our limited edition brogue matches the intrepid and sophisticated characteristics of Johnnie Walker Red Label perfectly.'

"Manchester United's £60million record signing Angel di Maria has been excellent since he arrived from Real Madrid. He is a real star. However, Louis van Gaal will have to find a way to get him more involved in games when his side don’t dominate play. He was quiet on Sunday— as he was against Chelsea last weekend — and didn’t give his full-back Luke Shaw too much help either. The goal came from Yaya Toure’s pass with Di Maria just watching. Angel di Maria struggled to get involved against Manchester City . Beware the goat, Gary . Former United defender and now Sky TV pundit Gary Neville spent some time on the touchline catching up with members of his old club’s backroom staff before kick-off but then ran into an old adversary in the form of City legend Shaun Goater.

"Former U.S. government subcontractor Alan Gross has been freed from a Cuban prison after five years. The 65-year-old married father-of-one was released on humanitarian grounds by the Cuban government at the request of the Obama administration. As part of the deal, three Cubans jailed in the U.S. have also been released. On Wednesday morning, Gross was on a U.S.-bound government plane to meet his family, who recently voiced concern about his gaunt frame and waning physique. Scroll down for video . Back home for Christmas: Former U.S. government subcontractor Alan Gross - pictured here in 2012 - has been freed from a Cuban prison after five years . 'I am afraid that we are at the end. After five years of literally wasting away, Alan is done,' his wife, Judy, said in a statement this month. Obama administration officials have considered Gross' imprisonment an impediment to improving relations with Cuba, but the surprise deal could help clear the way for broader discussions on strengthening ties and perhaps ending the decades-long U.S. economic embargo against its long-time communist foe. President Barack Obama was to address the nation on Cuba at noon Wednesday, the White House said, and U.S. officials speaking on condition of anonymity said he was expected to announce Gross' release. They were not authorized to be identified by name before Obama's remarks. Happier times: The 65-year-old married father-of-one was released on humanitarian grounds by the Cuban government at the request of the Obama administration - here he is pictured with his wife, Judy . Ongoing battle: Obama administration officials have considered Gross' imprisonment an impediment to improving relations with Cuba . Gross was detained in December 2009 while working to set up Internet access as a subcontractor for the U.S. government's U.S. Agency for International Development, which does work promoting democracy in the communist country. It was his fifth trip to Cuba to work with Jewish communities on setting up Internet access that bypassed local censorship. Cuba considers USAID's programs illegal attempts by the U.S. to undermine its government, and Gross was tried and sentenced to 15 years in prison. The three Cubans released in exchange for Gross are part of the so-called Cuban Five - a group of men who were part of the 'Wasp Network' sent by Cuba's then-President Fidel Castro to spy in South Florida. The men, who are hailed as heroes in Cuba, were convicted in 2001 in Miami on charges including conspiracy and failure to register as foreign agents in the U.S. Two of the Cuban Five were previously released after finishing their sentences. Turn of events: Gross was detained in December 2009 while working to set up Internet access as a subcontractor for the U.S. government's U.S. Agency for International Development, which does work promoting democracy in the communist country . In a statement marking the fifth anniversary of Gross' detention earlier this month, Obama hinted that his release could lead to a thaw in relations with Cuba. 'The Cuban Government's release of Alan on humanitarian grounds would remove an impediment to more constructive relations between the United States and Cuba,' Obama said in a statement. The president has taken some steps to ease U.S. restrictions on Cuba after Raul Castro took over as president in 2010 from his ailing brother. He has sought to ease travel and financial restrictions on Americans with family in Cuba, but has resisted calls to drop the embargo. The surprise prisoner swap has echoes of the deal the U.S. cut earlier this year to secure the release of Army Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl, who had been held by the Taliban. In exchange for his release in May, the U.S. turned over five Taliban prisoners held at the Guantanamo Bay detention center.","Alan Gross was arrested in Cuba on December 3 2009 while working covertly in the Communist-run country to set up Internet access .

"Minecraft is occasionally regarded as a creative way for children to keep themselves entertained, allowing them to build fantastic worlds and let their imagination run wild in a fun environment. But experts have warned that playing the game is actually inhibiting the imagination of children, and encourages ‘labour’ over ‘love’. Research suggests that putting children into such ‘structured’ play time can affect their development - and parents need to give them more free time to let their imagination run wild. A New York-based study says kids need more unstructured entertainment. It says giving children access to games and TV can inhibit their development of social skills. The study says games like Minecraft (shown) ultimately encourages 'labour' and monotonous tasks over 'love' and having fun . In an article on Quartz, Jun Lee from New York-based ReD Associates and Robert Pasin from Radio Flyer explained that Minecraft can discourage imagination in children. ‘In Minecraft, kids can build and explore new worlds and manipulate them with unprecedented control and precision,’ they write. Last week iTunes announced its biggest selling apps of the year, with Facebook and Minecraft both topping the best-seller charts from the App Store. Facebook's dedicated chat app was the most downloaded free app for iPhones in 2014, ahead of other social networking apps WhatsApp, Snapchat and Instagram. The official Facebook app was also fourth in the list, while dating app Tinder came in tenth place. Minecraft, the game that allows players to build their own world from scratch using the game's signature blocks, was the most popular paid-for app for both iPhone and iPad devices for the second year running. It beat 7 Minute Workout challenge on iPhone, and Football Manager Handheld 2014 on iPad. The mobile version of classic console title Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas and puzzle game Cut The Rope 2 also made the top 10 on both iPad and iPhone. ‘The underlying creativity is baked into the program - the combinations, tools and materials - so the players have only one task to complete: design ever more complex structures.’ ‘Though this seems like the pinnacle of an imaginative play experience, the kids we studied said they felt “edgy” and “irritable” after Minecraft sessions.’ They continued that the game, once kids have mastered it, becomes ‘less about open-ended play and more about working to complete the never-ending stacks of buildings.’ What their study says is that children play the game simply to eat up time and alleviate boredom, rather than finding more imaginative ways to stimulate themselves such as playing outside or inventing their own make-believe games. They say that children must be given more opportunities to have ‘unstructured’ play time at an early age away from video games and television, so that they learn the skills to overcome frustration. Otherwise, as found in their study, they will become irritable and confused when presented with free time, which can apparently lead to difficulties interacting with other children. What their study suggests is that children play the game simply to eat up time and alleviate boredom, rather finding more imaginative ways to stimulate themselves (stock image shown) such as playing outside or inventing their own make-believe games . Speaking to MailOnline, child health education specialist Dr Aric Sigman from East Sussex agreed that there is concern at the amount of time children of a young age are spent in front of a computer or television. He explained that in these scenarios, children are increasingly told how have to have fun, rather than come up with ideas themselves. In order to properly develop their social skills with others, he says that it is imperative that children are allowed to become bored with no easy form of entertainment. ‘Children really must be given the gift of boredom,’ he said. ‘Boredom and under-stimulation are two fears of modern aspirational parents, and this is a terrible misnomer. ‘It is absolutely necessary for children to become bored so they can learn early on how to stimulate themselves, and how to seek stimulation.’ He suggests that children under the age of three should not be encouraged to use television or computers at all, to allow their brains to benefit from free time. At higher ages he says brief exposure if okay but it is ‘all about the amount’ and parents should monitor closely the time they spend in front of a screen.","New York-based study says kids need more unstructured entertainment .

She told authorities that Castillo was her uncle and that he started sleeping with her when she was just 12. He married her two years later, and fathered four children with her over the past 10 years, according to News 4 San Antonio. Castillo was initially charged with two counts of burglary habitation with intent to commit a felony, one count of aggravated sexual assault, one count of prohibited sexual conduct and one count of aggravated assault with a deadly weapon, court records reveal. But most of these charges were dropped when Castillo  agreed to plead guilty to a charge of prohibited sexual conduct.

"They may be movements able-bodied people take for granted, but a robotic hand has been programmed to give a thumbs-up, scoop objects and pinch. And, not only can it carry out this unprecedented range of movement with ease, each motion is controlled using brainwaves of the wearer. Over the past two years, a quadgriplegic has used the hand to give high-fives to researchers, feed herself chocolate and now give a thumbs-up using simply her thoughts. Scroll down for video . The University of Pittsburgh’s hand connects to the brain using electrodes and lets the wearer control it using their thoughts. The 7D model of the hand could grasp and high-five.

She signed up to the University of Pittsburgh’s study in 2012, and was fitted with two quarter-inch electrode grids. Each electrode has 96 contact points covering regions of her brain that are responsible for right arm and hand movements. After the electrode grids in Ms Scheuermann’s brain were connected to a computer, creating a brain-machine interface, the contact points picked up pulses of electricity that were fired between the neurons. Computer algorithms were then used to decode these firing signals and identify the patterns associated with a particular arm movement, such as raising the arm or turning the wrist. The researchers used a virtual reality computer program to calibrate Ms Scheuermann’s control over the robotic arm. Jan Scheuermann (pictured using the arm) has been paralysed from the neck down since 2003. She signed up to the Pittsburgh study in 2012, and was fitted with two quarter-inch electrode grids.

Computer algorithms were used to decode brain signals and identify the patterns associated with a particular arm movement. The researchers then used a virtual reality computer program to calibrate Ms Scheuermann’s control over the robotic arm (pictured) Following this training, Ms Scheuermann was able to make the robotic arm reach for objects, as well as move in a number of directions, and flex and rotate the wrist, simply thinking about the movements. It also enabled recently her to high-five the researchers and feed herself chocolate. The previous hand was called 7D, but the latest, more advanced model is known as 10D. The 10D has extra dimensions that come from four types of hand movements - finger abduction, scoop, thumb extension and a pinch. This range of motions means Ms Scheuermann is more able to pick up, grasp and move more objects, more precisely than before. The 10D has extra dimensions that come from four types of hand movements - finger abduction, scoop, thumb extension and a pinch.This range of motions means Ms Scheuermann is more able to pick up, grasp and move more objects, and more precisely, than before (example objects used in the study are pictured) It is hoped these results, published in the Journal of Neural Engineering, can build on previous demonstrations and eventually allow robotic arms to restore natural arm and hand movements in people with upper limb paralysis. Co-author of the study Dr Jennifer Collinger said: ‘10D control allowed Jan to interact with objects in different ways, just as people use their hands to pick up objects depending on their shapes and what they intend to do with them. ‘We hope to repeat this level of control with additional participants and to make the system more robust, so that people who might benefit from it will one day be able to use brain-machine interfaces in daily life. ‘We also plan to study whether the incorporation of sensory feedback, such as the touch and feel of an object, can improve neuroprosthetic control.’ Ms Scheuermann added: ‘This has been a fantastic, thrilling, wild ride, and I am so glad I’ve done this. ‘This study has enriched my life, given me new friends and co-workers, helped me contribute to research and taken my breath away. For the rest of my life, I will thank God every day for getting to be part of this team.’ Jan Scheuermann, 55, signed up to the University of Pittsburgh’s study in 2012 and has nicknamed the arm Hector . In 1996, Jan Scheuermann was a . 36-year-old mother of two, running a party business. One day she noticed her legs seemed to drag behind her. Within two years, her legs and arms . progressively weakened to the point that she required a wheelchair, as . well as an attendant to assist her with dressing, eating, bathing and . other day-to-day activities. In . 1998  she was diagnosed with . spinocerebellar degeneration, in which the connections between the brain . and muscles slowly, and inexplicably, deteriorate. In February 2012, after screening tests to confirm that she was eligible . for the study, Dr Elizabeth . Tyler-Kabara from the University of Pittsburgh placed two quarter-inch . square electrode grids with 96 tiny contact points each in the regions . of Ms Scheuermann’s brain that would normally control right arm and . hand movement. Two days after the operation, the team hooked up the two terminals that . protrude from Ms Scheuermann’s skull to the computer. Within a week, Ms Scheuermann could . reach in and out, left and right, . and up and down with the arm, which she named Hector, giving her 3D control that had her high-fiving with researchers. Within three months she also could flex the wrist back and . forth, move it from side to side and rotate it clockwise and . counter-clockwise, as well as grip objects. In a study task, called the Action Research Arm Test, . Ms Scheuermann guided the arm from a position four inches above a table . to pick up blocks and tubes of different sizes, a ball and a stone and . put them down on a nearby tray.

"The red pigments in some of Vincent van Gogh's most valuable paintings are fading, according to new research. The Dutch impressionist's work is famed for its rustic beauty and bold colours, but some of the pigments are now at risk of disappearing entirely. Scientists studying the colour blue irises in one of Van Gogh's later paintings have found that the flowers were actually once purple. Scroll down for video . The blue irises in the foreground of Vincent van Gogh's Field with Irises near Arles, painting in 1888, were found to have actually contained a red pigment that has faded over time and were originally a purple colour . The red pigments used by the artist are fading and experts fear that they could deteriorate completely within a few decades. Dr Ella Hendricks, head of conservation at the Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam, made the discovery as part of research during restoration work on some of the 200 of Van Gogh's paintings held at the museum. Lake pigments are manufactured by precipitating a dye, usually by using a metallic salt to bind it. Red lake pigments became particularly popular during the Renaissance, allowing artists to produce vibrant colours of rich fabrics and draperies that became fashionable. Red lake pigments could also be translucent, meaning they were often used in layers of glaze over more opaque red, in order to create a deep, rich red colour. However, many lake pigments came from organic materials such as plants, and so tend to be unstable when exposed to light. The work lake comes from the word lac, which refers to a resinous secretion that occurs as the pigment is produced. Lighting levels at the museum have now been reduced by half in an attempt to slow the deterioration of the paint. Speaking to the Dutch public broadcaster NTR, she said: 'These blue irises were once purple. 'This is the result of the deterioration of red lake pigments by light.' Dr Hendriks, who is also a lecturer at the University of Amsterdam, was conducting her research in a joint project with scientists at the University of Tilburg, the Van Gogh Museum and the National Office of Cultural Heritage. They mapped the decay of colour in Van Gogh's Field with irises at Arles, which he completed in 1888. It is thought to be the first of a series of paintings of irises that he completed while at an asylum in Arles. Another of these, known simply as Irises, is listed among the most expensive paintings ever sold and is thought to be now worth more than £70.6 million. Their work raises the prospect that many of Van Gogh's other paintings, such as his famous still life of Sunflowers, are also at risk. Van Gogh struggled to sell his paintings during his life and wrestled with mental illness that led to him cutting off his own ear and later shot himself at the age of 37. It was only after his death that the importance of his work began to be truely recognised and his works are now among the most expensive paintings ever sold. In 1993 his painting A Wheatfield with Cypresses sold for £36 million. Descriptions by Van Gogh of the colour of his lodgings that he painted in The Bedroom show that the floor and walls actually contained more red pigment, giving them more vivid shades than they have today . Experts used computer reconstructions to boost the red in Van Gogh's paintings to see how they would have originally looked before they faded under the bright lights that has caused the red pigment to degrade . The first hints that Van Gogh's paintings were fading came during the restoration of another of his artworks, The Bedroom. In a series of letters to his brother and sister, Van Gogh described in detail the vivid colours of his room. This allowed scientists to reconstruct how the painting would have originally looked. They found that the pale brown floor should have been a richer purple and peach colour while the blue walls were originally an orange-red and violet. Writing about the restoration work conducted on Van Gogh's The Bedroom, Leo Jansen, a curator at the Van Gogh Museum, said: 'The most intriguing issue, of course, is discolouration. 'Now that we know the purplish-peachy colour of the floor and the blue of the walls were originally more like orange-red and violet, respectively, we would love to figure out how the work originally looked. 'Though I doubt we will ever be able to reconstruct the original colour scheme exactly, in the future we will look at other works for which Van Gogh’s letters mention one colour, violet, for instance, while we now see another,such as blue. 'To begin with, there are the other versions of The bedroom, but we could also look at Van Gogh’s oil copies of black-and-white prints, which he called ‘translations in colour’. For instance Snow-covered field with a harrow.' The researchers hope to examine other works by Van Gogh, such as his famous Sunflower still lifes, that may have contained red lake pigment to see if their colour has changed over time after years on display . Van Gogh's paintings, such as this painting of Vase with Daises, and Poppies, rarely come up for sale but this still life sold for more than £39.3 million when it sold at an auction at Sotheby's in New York last month . Dr Hendricks and her team are now using computer software to build up a picture of how the paintings originally looked. For now, however, they will not be attempting to restore the original colour to the paintings. Instead curators at the Van Gogh Museum have lowered the level of ambient light and introduced dark backgrounds to help reduce reflected light to help extend the life of the paintings. Kees van den Meirackeruit, head of the collection at the Van Gogh Museum, said: Depending on the amount of hours that you exhibit a painting, it may be that you have reached the limit after 20 years, or you can display it less to stretch to 30 years. 'With measures such as ambient, dark backs and bringing the light back to about half of what it was several years ago, we can solve much.'","Experts at the Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam compared the colour in impressionist's paintings with descriptions he gave in personal letters .

"As lava courses through Hawaii’s Big Island towards a shopping centre, residents are making plans to keep well out of its way. But what happens if you are faced with the prospect of walking on lava? On a holiday to Kilauea in Hawaii, neuroscientist Alex Rivest decided to find out, when his tour guide offered to tread into a pool of scorching molten rock. Scroll down for video . Man v lava: On a recent holiday to Kilauea in Hawaii, neuroscientist Alex Rivest decided to find out what would happen if you stepped on lava, which is around 700 to 1,200 °C (1,292 to 2,192 °F) Lava is around 700 to 1,200 °C (1,292 to 2,192 °F) when it emerges from a volcano and then makes its way to the path of least resistance. The tour guide’s boot is shown to make a small impression, sparking a flame which bounced off the surface. ‘While this may not be surprising (it is liquid rock), I think that many people think of lava as more of a hot-watery-like substance,’ said Mr Rivest who is originally from Massachusetts. ‘You would never fall into a lava lake the way you would a swimming pool, the molten rock is much more dense, so you would simply land on it, sink a little, and be burned.’ The tour guide’s shoe is shown to make a small impression, sparking a flame which bounced off the surface . Heating up: Lava is currently moving through Hawaii’s Big Island towards a shopping centre, and residents are making plans to keep well out of its way . The word lava can be used to describe molten rock expelled by a volcano during an eruption and the rock that solidifies and cools after an eruption. When first erupted from a volcano, lava is a liquid and its temperature ranges from 700 to 1,200°C. It is up to 100,000 times as viscous - thick and sticky - as water. A 'lava flow' is when lava flows from a volcano and is created during a 'non-explosive effusive eruption.' When it has stopped moving, lava solidifies to form igneous rock. Explosive eruptions create a mixture of volcanic ash and other fragments called tephra, rather than lava flows. Kilauea is thought to be 300,000 to 600,000 years old and is one of the most active volcanoes in the world. It has continuously erupted since 1983. Lava from Kilauea volcano has been threatening Pahoa town, which has a population of about 900, for months. In October, it burned a house and covered part of a cemetery but stalled just before hitting Pahoa's main road. ‘At certain locations, and only under proper guidance and safety procedures, you can visit some of the lava fronts. It is truly one of the most amazing things to witness,’ said Mr Rivest. The video follows footage which emerged last year showing a man taking five steps up a flow of lava on Mount Etna in Sicily. The film was analysed by a geoscientist who has confirmed it is possible to walk on lava. Erik Klemetti, from Denis University in Ohio, explained in his Eruptions Blog that when boiling hot lava hits the cool air, it forms a dark crust that can be stood on - albeit for a short period of time. And although lava appears to flow like a stream, it is more viscous than water, which Mr Klemetti claims means it can withstand a small amount of pressure. Kilauea is thought to be 300,000 to 600,000 years old and is one of the most active volcanoes in the world . In a previous blog post, Mr Klametti explained that falling into lava would cause the water inside a human body to boil, turn to steam and the person would 'explode from within.' And it isn't just feet that are being tested in lava. There is a whole YouTube channel dedicated to throwing cans of food and drink into the molten material. In one video, lavapix shows how a can of ravioli would slowly melt away when covered in lava, and eventually explode. 'Don't try this at home,' filmmaker Bryan Lowry cautions. 'Of course if you do have a lava flow at your house, trying this is the least of your problems. 'Safety precautions were taken and only the GoPro was slightly in harms way.' Kilauea is the youngest and most active Hawaiian shield volcano, located on the southern part of the island .

"They boast some of the most famous faces in the country among their number but not every member of the Royal Family is so easily identified, as police outside Buckingham Palace discovered today. Officers had to resort to a crib sheet to pick out the likes of Princess Alexandra and Prince Michael of Kent but had no such difficulty with the  senior royals on the guest list, among them the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, Prince George and Prince Harry. Prince William, who was fresh from an early morning visit to homeless charity Centrepoint in London's Soho, arrived with his glossy-haired wife, who looked lovely in her festive cherry-red dress and dramatic chandelier earrings. Scroll down for video . Adorable: Prince George was driven into the event seated in the back of his parents' car and clutching a bright yellow book . Busy day: The Duke of Cambridge, fresh from a trip to Centrepoint, arrived with a fresh-faced Duchess of Cambridge . All together: 16-month-old Prince George joined his parents in the car along with his nanny, Maria Theresa Borallo . Looking good: Despite her husband insisting that it is a nightmare, the Duchess' hair looked glossy and gorgeous . Accessories: The Duchess teamed her cherry-red dress with a pair of striking chandelier earrings. Maria Theresa Borrallo is seated behind . Bold choice: Kate has made increasingly bold fashion choices in recent months, most notably the hot pink Mulberry coat worn in New York . His brother Harry arrived seated beside his formidable looking close protection officer but, ever charming, was all smiles as he was driven past waiting photographers. Equally cheerful was Canadian Autumn Kelly, the blonde wife of Princess Anne's son Peter Phillips, who offered waiting members of the public a wave as she flashed past. Princess Anne and the Earl of Wessex were also at the luncheon, as was Anne's husband Vice Admiral Sir Timothy Laurence who, unusually, arrived for the event on foot. Others invited to join the party included Prince and Princess Michael of Kent, their daughter Lady Gabriella Windsor, Prince Richard, Duke of Gloucester and a fresh-faced Princess Beatrice who smiled happily as she was driven in. Who's who? The police guarding the Buckingham Palace gates needed a crib sheet to identify more obscure members of the family .

Ready to eat: Prince Edward drove himself to the event and arrived with his close protection officer seated beside him . Cheerful: Prince Edward smiled as he drove through the gates for the Queen's annual pre-Christmas lunch . Just as the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge like to dress their son in contemporary versions of traditional classics, so too with his reading material. As the 16-month-old prince was driven into Buckingham Palace, what looked like a copy of one of the Curious George books could be seen clutched in his fingers. Written by Hans Augusto and Margret Rey, the first book in the series, Cecily G. and the Nine Monkeys, made its debut in France in 1939, although the central character was called Fifi instead. When the book made its UK debut in 1941, the monkey, by then called George elsewhere, was rechristened Zozo to spare King George VI the embarrassment of sharing his name with an ape. By the time the second book in the series, Curious George Takes A Job, was published in 1947, the monkey had his name back and Curious George has remained Curious George ever since. Although the Reys wrote only the first seven books, such is their popularity, new books written and illustrated 'in the style' of the Reys have been appearing since 1998. Authors and illustrators of the second series include Mary O'Keefe Young, Martha Weston, Anna Grossnickle Hines, Michael Jensen, and Vipah Interactive. The Queen's annual pre-Christmas lunch is a royal tradition and allows her to catch up with more distant relations, who are not invited to join her at the Sandringham Estate in Norfolk on the 25th. All of the senior royals, among them Prince Charles and Camilla, William and Kate, and the Earl and Countess of Wessex are expected at the country estate on Christmas Day and appear alongside the monarch at the traditional Christmas morning church service. One member of the Royal Family who appeared to be particularly looking forward to his lunch was Prince George, who was driven into the Palace beside his nanny, Maria Theresa Borrallo in the back of his parents' car. George, who was adorably smiley as he peered out of the window, is due to celebrate his second Christmas at Sandringham next week - and his last as an only child. The 16-month-old royal and his parents are also due to relocate to Anmer Hall on the Sandringham Estate where an extended nursery big enough for two babies has been prepared. George's new sibling is due in April and will live with his or her parents and older brother at the Norfolk property. The little prince will also have to share his nanny, who is expected to help care for the new arrival. Carole and Michael Middleton, who have spent a considerable amount of time with Prince George over the last year, are also expected to take a hand in raising the new arrival and will join the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge at Anmer Hall on Boxing Day. Low key: Vice Admiral Sir Timothy Laurence, the husband of Princess Anne, was the only royal to arrive at the Palace on foot . Royal arrival: Prince Richard, Duke of Gloucester, is driven into Buckingham Palace for lunch . Nice day out: Princess Alexandra of Kent arrives for lunch with the Queen at Buckingham Palace today . Obscure: Julia Oglivy, who is the wife of James Oglivy, the son of Sir Angus Ogilvy and Princess Alexandra, was at the lunch . Adorable: Lord Nicholas Windsor brought his adorable sons Albert and Leopold to meet their more famous relations . On their way: Timothy Taylor, Lady Helen Taylor and their daughter Estella arrive for the lunch party . Big arrival: Prince and Princess Michael of Kent drove in with their festively-dressed daughter, Lady Gabriella Windsor . Stylish: 33-year-old Lady Gabriella teamed her scarlet dress with a pair of matching red coral earrings . Solemn: The Duke of Kent, who is the Queen's first cousin, looked solemn as he was driven into the Palace . Visiting: The festive lunch party was completed by Lady Sarah Chatto and her husband Daniel . She is almost as famous for her shiny locks as her cousin by marriage, the Duchess of Cambridge, but Princess Beatrice was taking no chances when it came to having lunch with the Queen. The 26-year-old royal was spotted emerging from a South Kensington hair salon, hours before being driven to Buckingham Palace for the royal family's annual pre-Christmas lunch. Beatrice, who is currently completing an internship, was caught up in the recent Sony scandal after details of her salary were among those leaked by hackers, believed to be linked to North Korea. Despite having endured a torrid few days as a result, the Princess was all smiles as she left the salon and appeared to be on cheerful form as she was driven into Buckingham Palace. Taking no chances: Princess Beatrice was spotted leaving a South Kensington hair salon early this morning .

"He is perhaps best known for patrolling the beaches of Los Angeles and dishing out advice to Britain's Got Talent contestants. But now David Hasselhoff is putting his unique talents to a completely different project - namely preserving the Berlin Wall. The actor and singer has put his name behind a campaign to preserve one of the few remaining sections of the wall, calling it a 'sacred' monument. Scroll down for video . Passionate: David Hasselhoff is campaigning to preserve the Berlin Wall. He is pictured speaking to a crowd in Berlin yesterday . Popular: A huge crowd gathered to see the U.S. actor and singer speak from a van at the East Side Gallery . Yesterday, the actor, best known for starring in 'Knight Rider' and 'Baywatch', joined ordinary Berliners in protesting a real estate developer's plans to move part of the wall to make way for an access path for a luxury housing development. 'It's like tearing down an Indian burial ground. It's a no-brainer,' said Hasselhoff. The American won the hearts of many Germans for his schmaltzy hit 'Looking for Freedom', which was one of the soundtracks to their peaceful 1989 revolution. He belted out the song to a million people on both sides of the wall during a New Year's Eve concert that year. Fans: The American won the hearts of many Germans for his schmaltzy hit 'Looking for Freedom', which was one of the soundtracks to their peaceful 1989 revolution . Big moment: David Hasselhoff belted out the song to a million people on both sides of the wall during a New Year's Eve concert in 1989, pictured . Plans to move part of the East Side . Gallery - a three-quarter-of-a mile stretch of wall painted by artists . after the fall of communism and popular with tourists - sparked angry . protests earlier this month. Activists have denounced it as part of a wider trend of steamrolling Berlin's tumultuous history to make way for gleaming but soulless developments in the heart of the city. At least 136 people died between 1961 and 1989 trying to cross the wall that divided the communist-run East Berlin from West Berlin. Most of the wall has since been destroyed, with only two large sections remaining as memorials. 'This last piece of the wall is really sacred,' Hasselhoff said. 'It's about people and it's about hearts that were broken, hearts that were torn apart and lives that were lost. That's what we're talking about today, not a piece of real estate.' The Berlin Wall struck fear in the hearts of many Germans over almost three decades. Construction of the wall by the German Democratic Republic began in August 1961. Once completed, it completely cut off West Berlin from the surrounding East Germany and East Berlin. Guard towers were located along concrete walls and it also contained anti-vehicle trenches. Divide: This image shows the Berlin Wall in 1985 . According to the the Eastern Bloc the wall was built to protect the population from fascist elements who wanted to prevent the 'will of the people'. However, in truth, the wall's purpose was to prevent the massive emigration and defection which marked Germany and the communist Eastern Bloc followed the Second World War. Following a series of political changes in the Eastern Bloc in 1989 the East German government announced on November 9 that all its citizens could visit West Germany and West Berlin. Historic: Memorable scenes were beamed around the world when thousands of Berliners from east and west of the city celebrated the opening of the Berlin Wall in 1989 . Huge crowds of people crossed and climbed on the wall in scenes which were previously unthinkable and were broadcast by television crews around the world. By 1990, the wall itself was mainly destroyed. However, parts of it still remain in the city today. Between 1961 and 1989, around 5,000 people attempted to escape over the wall, with an estimated death toll of over 600. Asked if he thought his song had . played any role in bringing down the most visible section of the Iron . Curtain, Hasselhoff said: 'Whether it had anything to do with anything, . it's a song about freedom and it stuck in their head because it had a . good hook.' Berliners can . prepare for a reprise if talks involving the developers, authorities and . campaigners fail to reach a compromise next week. 'If it goes to the next step, we'll come back with a huge concert and really rock Berlin,' said `The Hoff.'

And here we are, 10 years later, making it legal,' she said. Lemigova, a former Miss USSR who now runs a skin care company said it was a shock.

"Controversial comedian Russell Brand has landed in the middle of his latest controversy accusing the United States  of terrorism just hours after 132 Pakistani children were murdered by the Taliban. Brand was interviewing Moazzam Begg, a Briton who was detained at Guantanamo Bay when he wrote: 'The people who do ""terror"" best are the people who decide what ""terror"" is.' The nine minute interview was posted on YouTube and said it would 'lift the lid' on Guantanamo Bay torture. Scroll down for video . Comedian Russell Brand accused the United States of being terrorists in his latest outpouring on Twitter . Brand was interviewing former British Guantanamo Bay detainee Moazzam Begg, pictured, when he landed in his most recent controversy in the aftermath of the Taliban's massacre of 132 school children in Pakistan . Russell Brand created the latest Twitter storm after accusing the United States of terrorism in his Tweet . One Twitter user Colin Wright said: 'You do talk crap at times. Not all the time but I'm seeing it more and more.' Another user, Mark Lott claimed: 'I guess you haven't seen the news from Pakistan today yet.' Nate Anderson added: 'Bad timing given what's just happened in Pakistan dude. Bad bad timing.' Brand was attacking the United States over their detention of Moazzam Begg, who was held after being arrested in Pakistan in 2002. He was brought to Guantanamo Bay and released without charge in 2005. He spoke to Mr Begg about his experiences at the hands of the US military and the CIA in Guantanamo Bay and Baghram Air Base in Afghanistan. Mr Begg said his interrogators asked him repeatedly about what was happening to his family when audio of a woman screaming was played in a different room. The former detainee said he was threatened with being sent to Egypt or Syria, where prisoners were regularly tortured. In his interview, Mr Brand said: 'Language is so integral to our understanding of these issues. For or quite a while, I thought that waterboarding was just a hobby. They're just doing some waterboarding, oh that's nice, some time off between the torture.' In a monologue at the end of his latest broadcast, Brand claimed: 'If we have a criminal government, none of us are free. If our freedom is contingent on total compliance, then none of us are free. If people are being tortured in our names or the names of the institutions that govern us, then none of us are free. It is ironic that the people that do terror best are the people who decide what terror is.' He had earlier become embroiled in the Sydney terrorist outrage, by claiming that Man Haron Monis was not a terrorist. Brand said: ''By us labelling him a terrorist rather than a dangerous mentally ill person - not that all mentally ill people are dangerous, I'm mentally ill - and by allowing him to set the agenda ""I'm doing this on behalf of Islam"" it gives a certain grandeur to nihilistic and violent actions but what's more interesting than the actions of a mentally ill person is the response of the political establishment,' he continued. The comedian also blamed the media for fitting the story into their own frame, amid worldwide fears about Islamic State. 'It's convenient for people to enhance and increase fear around ISIL because currently there's an appetite to increase security measures domestically, to engage in foreign military activity in that region of the world for economic and corporate ends.' Several Twitter users immediately attacked Brand's Tweet because of the ongoing situation in Pakistan . Brand criticised media reports that claimed gunman Man Haron Monis was a terrorist with links to ISIS . Monis kept 18 people captive for many hours until police stormed the cafe in the early hours of Tuesday . Brand dispersed Australian news reports and addresses from Mr Abbott in between his statements, and made the claim that terrorism is more a structure upheld by governments as a tool of power than anything else. 'Terrorism is continually used as a tool to control a domestic population. I'm not saying there aren't a lot of dangerous people out there, I'm saying a lot of those people are in government,' he said. Australia's new terror and metadata laws were also up for discussion, with Brand saying giving authorities the immunity from prosecution is very dangerous, especially in light of recent information surrounding the CIA and torture claims. Brand also claimed Prime Minister Tony Abbott and the government used the situation to fit their own framework . But he did acknowledge that 'we' need to pull together in times such as these . He however ended his bulletin on a more positive note, saying the #illridewithyou hashtag was 'an offer of solidarity'. 'We have at this point got to pull together more than ever, when people control the media like Rupert Murdoch who says things like ""Egyptians being white, all the Egyptians I know are white"", . 'Of course what's happened in Australia is sad and of course there's dangerous things going on in the world but our media uses that danger to suit their ends. 'It's really important in this time of division and fear that we embrace one another. Us, the normal people in the middle, embrace one another. Forget the extremists are either end of the social scale, whether they are motivated by religion or money or desire for power, and us, the ordinary people that want to make connections, have a right and a duty, in fact, to define the way we see reality,' Brand concluded.","Russell Brand has criticised the United States in his latest Twitter rant .

"An Indiana police officer has caused outraged after offering t-shirts for sale with the legend 'Breathe Easy: Don't break the law' on the front. The t-shirts were produced by Corporal Jason Barthel of the City of Mishawaka Police in Indiana who owns and operates the South Bend Uniform Company. The t-shirts, which cost from $7.95 are seen as a play on the final words of Eric Garner who died after being restrained by the New York Police Department. Police officer Jason Barthel from Indiana  caused controversy when he released his new t-shirts, pictured . Corporal Bartel used his Facebook page in a bid to explain that he did not mean any offence with his t-shirt . Garner, who was restrained in a choke-hold after he was spotted selling single cigarettes in New York told officers 'I can't breathe', before slipping into unconsciousness. Corporal Barthel said criticism of his t-shirts is misunderstood. He said on his company's Facebook page: 'For those upset, please understand when we use the slogan ""Breathe Easy"" we are referring to knowing the police are there for you! 'We are one people, one nation regardless of race, religion, creed or gender. We are all in this together. The police are here to protect and serve. 99.9% of us have the greater good in our hearts each time we strap on our uniforms and duty belts. 'We are all one people and this is by no means is a slam on Eric Garner or his family, God rest his soul. Lets all band together as AMERICANS regardless of our feelings and know we can and will be better! Thank you for your support.'

Basketball star LeBron James, pictured, is one of the high-profile supporters of the I Can't Breath campaign . Other basketball stars such as Kobe Bryant, centre, have also donned the t-shirt supporting civil rights . It is understood that more than 100 of the t-shirts have so far been sold online. The 'I can't breathe' slogan has been used widely across America since Mr Garner's death last month. A number of celebrities, including basketball star LeBron James have worn t-shirt with the slogan. South Bend District Council President Oliver Davis told the New York Daily News: 'We believe that people should be able to breathe easy no matter what they're doing. Police should not take the right to breathe into their own hands.' Commenting on the controversial t-shirt, Mr Davis said: 'It has a strong message to people to let them know that justice is not fair. People need the right to be able to breathe easy no matter where we are in life and the justice system should be the ones to deal with that, not just the police officers.' Adam Duckworth posted on the company's Facebook page criticising the t-shirt. He said: 'This company exploits death, tragedy and ignorance for profit and publicity under the guise of supporting local law enforcers. 'Contrary to the implications of their merchandise, DEATH DOES NOT = JUSTICE. If you bought the ""breathe easy"" shirt, you are basically agreeing that appropriate use of force when dealing with any and all petty criminals and even remotely ""suspicious"" people is to skirt the justice system entirely via immediate deployment of the death penalty.'","Police officer Jason Barthel designed the t-shirts for his uniform company .

"Admission: Actor Stephen Collins has admitted to inappropriate conduct with young girls in a new confessional essay for People magazine . The actor who played the righteous dad and pastor on long-running TV show 7th Heaven, has come out to confirm shocking reports of sexual misconduct with young girls. Stephen Collins has admitted to the crimes in a lengthy confessional essay for People magazine, saying he inappropriately touched one girl and exposed himself to two others between 1973 and 1994, and that his actions were 'inexcusable' and have 'haunted' him ever since. While none of his victims have ever publicly come forward, and the 67-year-old never charged, reports of his misbehavior surfaced in October when his soon-to-be ex-wife Faye Grant released a taped confession which was obtained by TMZ in the midst of their bitter divorce. In the public backlash to the TMZ tapes, Collins lost parts on TV show Scandal and in the sequel to the movie Ted, while re-runs of 7th Heaven were pulled from the air. 'Forty years ago, I did something terribly wrong that I deeply regret. I have been working to atone for it ever since,' Collins wrote in People. He says he's decided to speak publicly about the reports because he believes some of his actions have been elaborated. 'On the recording, I described events that took place 20, 32, and 40 years ago,' Collins adds. 'The publication of the recording has resulted in assumptions and innuendos about what I did that go far beyond what actually occurred. As difficult as this is, I want people to know the truth.' He says the only time he touched a girl inappropriately was in 1973, when he was 25 and a pre-teen girl came to stay with him and his first wife. Collins says he exposed himself to the girl twice before, but took things to another level on the visit. 'When the girl and I were watching TV alone, I moved her hand in such a way that caused her to touch me inappropriately. It lasted less than a minute, during which there was no gratification,' Collins said. 'I then left the room. I had no further physical contact with her. It was a completely impulsive act and it's haunted me ever since to think of what I put her through.' Scroll down for video . Scandal: Collins is best known for playing Reverend Eric Camden on long-running family drama 7th Heaven (left). Reports about his indiscretions first came to light in October when his estranged wife Faye Grant (pictured together on the right) released a taped confession which was obtained TMZ . Over the next two decades, Collins says he continued to expose himself to two more teenage girls, once in 1982 and again in 1994. 'The first instance lasted second and the second about a minute,' Collins says of the indecent exposure. 'I had no physical contact of any kind with either girl. I don't say this to excuse what I did - it was inexcusable - but to clarify what actually happened.' Collins says the exposure in 1994 was his 'rock bottom' and what caused him to finally seek help for his deviant behavior. For the past twenty years, Collins says he's undergoing therapy and religious counseling, while praying and meditating every day. These treatments, Collins claims, have worked and kept him from harming other young girls. 'Since that day in 1994, I have not had an impulse to act out in any such way.' Collins has only apologized directly to one of his victims, who he says was 'extraordinary gracious', but has not reached out to the others for fear that he will be 'opening old wounds'. Family values: 7th Heaven was a show about a pastor and his wife, raising their large brood of seven children. A young Jessica Biel (to Collins' right in a blue sweater) played the couple's oldest daughter. Collins says he never behaved inappropriately toward any of the young actresses on the show's set . The actor also describes how the recorded confession came to be. He says he and his wife Grant were undergoing marriage therapy sessions in hopes of healing their relationship. The second follow-up session is when Collins says he and the therapist were taped by his wife without either of their knowledge. The couple of nearly thirty years, filed for divorce in 2012 but have been engaged in a heated legal battle over how to split their assets. Grant, who is also an actress, is fighting for high spousal support payments of $13,000 a month, saying she is no longer able to make a living from her career when she took a break to raise their daughter. She also says she only released the taped confession to police, when Collins allegedly denied to seek treatment for his issues. She denies ever turning the audio over to TMZ. Collins says the release of the tapes in October led to confusion over when he exposed himself to the young girls, and if it was possible one of his young co-stars on 7th Heaven was a victim. 'I appeared for eleven seasons on a television series with a cast that included minor females in our TV family, and countless other young actresses throughout the show's eleven years. I never behaved inappropriately on or off that set - or on any set I've ever worked on.' When the tapes were first released, law enforcement in New York and Los Angeles said they were investigating the claims. But law enforcement sources who spoke with TMZ said that despite the taped confession, they felt Collins would not be charged and 'the cases will go nowhere'. The LAPD confirmed to MailOnline on Wednesday that they never reopened a case into Collins, and had simply been reviewing the recording in October. Calls and emails to the NYPD were not immediately returned Wednesday. Collins says he planned to release a statement after his divorce was finalized, but decided to come forward earlier when the trial was postponed. He says he owed family, friends and the public an explanation. 'I want to reassure them about who I am, and I want them to understand that I take these issues very seriously,' he said. Collins is due to speak about the essay with Katie Couric on Friday.","The actor was first accused of the abuse in October, when his ex-wife released a taped confession from a marriage therapy session .

"American Apparel has fired founder Dov Charney and named longtime fashion executive Paula Schneider to be its next CEO. The Los Angeles-based company’s board voted to oust Mr Charney as CEO in June, citing allegations of misconduct. He was put under suspension this summer, but still served as a consultant to the company. American Apparel said Tuesday that it has terminated his position 'for cause' after an internal investigation. Scroll down for video . End of an era: American Apparel has fired controversial founder Dov Charney after an internal investigation and named longtime fashion executive Paula Schneider to be its next CEO . Ms Schneider said in an interview: 'I'm very, very excited to be part of something that is such a big influence on pop culture and helps so many Americans.' Calling American Apparel 'the largest manufacturer of apparel in North America,' she added: 'There are a lot of jobs and a lot of people, and we want to keep that going.' American Apparel, which Mr Charney founded in 1998, manufactures clothes and sells them in 245 of its own retail stores in 20 countries and has about 10,000 employees. It is famous for selling American-made goods and for its risque advertising. The Montreal-born Mr Charney has been the subject of lawsuits that allege he had inappropriate sexual conduct with female employees. He has said he had consensual sexual relationships with workers. Final decision: American Apparel said Tuesday that a special committee of its board decided that 'it would not be appropriate for Mr Charney to be reinstated as CEO or an officer or employee' In 2011, a former employee accused Mr Charney of keeping her as a teenage sex slave, fearing she could lose her job otherwise. She also sued American Apparel and its directors for failing to stop him from acting as a 'sexual predator.' In 2012, Mr Charney once again came under fire when Michael Bumblis, a former store manager in Malibu, California, accused the CEO of rubbing dirt in his face and choking him. Mr Charney also allegedly called the man 'a wannabe Jew' and used a derogatory term for homosexuals. Mr Bumblis was later fired from his job. Moving on: Longtime fashion executive Paula Schneider (left, in 2004), formerly of Warnaco, Gores Group and BCBG Max Azria, has been named as the retailer's next CEO . American Apparel said Tuesday that a special committee of its board decided, based on the results of an internal investigation conducted by FTI Consulting, that 'it would not be appropriate for Mr Charney to be reinstated as CEO or an officer or employee.' The company has suffered financially. It has recorded annual losses since 2010 and reported three quarterly losses this year. Its stock has dropped 53per cent in 2014. Ms Schneider, who officially starts as CEO on January 5, has been a senior executive at retail and clothing companies including Warnaco, Gores Group and BCBG Max Azria. She said in a statement that she hopes to 'make American Apparel a better company, while staying true to its core values of quality and creativity and preserving its sweatshop-free, Made in USA manufacturing philosophy.' American Apparel has operated under two interim CEOs since Mr Charney’s ouster, most recently Scott Brubaker, who will continue in that role through the end of the year. Shares rose 5 cents, or 8.6per cent, to 63 cents in after-hours trading.

"A 17-year-old girl who was sexually exploited by ten men is pregnant and claims one of the men is the father of her unborn child. Last month ten men were given injunctions by Birmingham City Council barring them from contacting the teenager or other under 18s they did not know after a judge ruled they had sexually exploited her. But it has emerged during court hearings into the case that the teenager is pregnant and claims Sarfraz Riaz, one of the men who was given an order to stay away, is the father. The girl had described 32-year-old Mr Riaz as her 'boyfriend' during proceedings at the High Court in London and said he had fathered her child. A 17-year-old girl who was sexually exploited by ten men in Birmingham, who were given injunctions to stop then contacting her, is pregnant and claims one of them is the father, the High Court has been told . A judge had previously banned any reporting of her pregnancy but decided to lift the ban after ruling that publishing the details were unlikely to lead to her being identified or cause her more distress than she had already suffered. It was lifted after representations by the Press Association news agency who said it was important that the public were made aware that pregnancy was a consequence of sexual exploitation. Mr Justice Keehan said the decision was difficult and a balance between the girl's human right to respect for private life and the media's right to freedom of expression. But he said he doubted that revealing the pregnancy would significantly increase the girl's distress or the risk of her being identified. In his ruling he said Mr Riaz had been a 'most unimpressive witness' who had denied being the father of the teenager's child or having sex with her. 'I note that (the girl's) assertions that Sarfraz Riaz was her boyfriend and the father of her unborn child were made at a time when she was fully supportive of him,' he said. 'Accordingly it would appear that her assertions were not borne out of malice or to falsely implicate him.' He added: 'Sarfraz Riaz denied ever having sexual intercourse with (the girl), he denied being the father of her unborn child and he denied sexually exploiting her. Sarfraz Riaz was a most unimpressive witness. '(The girl) may be wrong in identifying him as the father of her unborn child but her assertion, at a time when she was supportive of him, indicates that they had had sexual intercourse. On the totality of the evidence I find they so did and that Sarfraz Riaz is lying when he denies the same.' Birmingham City Council applied for injunctions  to protect the girl from exploitation (picture posed by model) The judge said Mr Riaz was serving a prison sentence for a sexual assault which does not relate to the girl. He has maintained he was wrongly convicted for the offence. Mr Riaz has 14 criminal convictions including for offences of burglary, racially aggravated assault and drugs offences. The court heard that the 17-year-old girl had suffered a 'difficult childhood', had frequently ran away from home and had been made the subject of a police protection order when she was 13 after she went missing for six days. The judge said when in her early teens the child had placed herself in situations of 'grave risk' and had been seen getting in and out of cars 'in the company of adult Asian males'. She was housed by Birmingham City Council as a young teenager and police and social workers said she had been at risk of serious harm. The judge had been told at hearings at the Family Division of the High Court in London and Birmingham that more recently the girl had been found in hotel rooms and around cars with men by police in Birmingham. The council applied to the High Court for civil injunctions against the men to protect the girl from being exploited. Mr Justice Keehan said last month he was 'satisfied' that each of the men had sexually exploited the girl and made orders barring them from contacting the 17-year-old until she turned 18 and any other under 18s they did not know. He made orders against: Mohammed Anjam, Omar Ahmed, Naseem Khan, Mohammed Javed, Shah Alam, Sajid Hussain, Rahman Aziz, Imran Uddin, Mansur Ahmed and Mr Riaz.","A High Court judge gave 10 men injunctions barring them from contacting a girl last month who he said had been sexually exploited by the group .

"The New York's Police Commissioner has offered a $12,000 reward for the arrest and conviction of seven people who  attacked two lieutenants on the Brooklyn Bridge. Police Commissioner Bill Bratton released pictures of the seven suspects officers believe were involved in a clash between protesters and the lieutenants during a march calling for justice for Eric Garner on Sunday. The incident began when the two officers arrested a City University of New York professor, Eric Linsker, 29, as he tried to pour a rubbish bin onto other cops from a pedestrian overpass. They were punched and kicked in the heads, leaving them needing instant medical attention. Ironically, the officers were from the department's Legal Bureau and were only present at the protest to ensure that demonstrators' civil rights were respected by police. Scroll down for video . Male suspects one, two and three - police want to speak to anyone who recognizes them . Man number four, as well as female suspects one . Female suspects two and three - the women were among the first to attack . Police have now found images of four men and three women they believe were involved in the attack, enhanced from a two minute YouTube video. The video shows the women and one of the men were the first to attack Lt Patrick Sullivan and Lt Patrick Chan, the New York Post reports. Male Number 3 and Male Number 4 get involved later, kicking the officers and pulling them to the ground. Male number 4 ends the attack by punching Lt. Chan, whose nose was broken in the assault. Lt Sullivan was left with cuts and bruises. Bratton is hoping the offer of the reward - as well as the release of images of people who witnessed the attack - will mean he can bring the attackers to justice. 'It's to the benefit of the organizers of these marches, and the participants, to work with us,' Bratton said. Bratton, who referred to the suspects as 'agitators and anarchists', added: 'Their world is a very different world often times than the world the rest of us live in. They don't like government, they don't society, they don't like anything. 'So they're seeking to take advantage of it.' His tone is in stark contrast to that of New York's mayor, Bill de Blasio, who was branded a 'total nicompoop' after he used the word 'allegedly' to describe a mob assault by protesters on two police lieutenants. Demonstrators marched over the Brooklyn Bridge on Saturday during the Justice for All rally and march . It is thought 25,000 to 30,000 people joined the rally, which left two officers needing medical attention . It was just one of many similar protests across the country . Thousands of . demonstrators marched in Washington, New York, Boston, Chicago and Oakland on . Saturday to protest against killings of unarmed black men by . police officers. Organizers said the marches were among the largest in a . recent wave of protests against the deaths that have cast a . global spotlight on race relations in the United States. The rallies were mainly peaceful, though police in Boston . said they arrested 23 people who tried to block a highway. Officers in Oakland, California said they detained about 45 . people for vandalism, failure to disperse, resisting arrest and . other charges after thousands took to the . streets. Decisions by grand juries to return no indictments against . the officers involved in the deaths of Michael Brown in Missouri . and Eric Garner in New York have put police treatment of . minorities back on the national agenda. 'We're going to keep the light on Mike Brown ... on all of . the victims. The only way you make roaches run is to keep the . light on,' said civil rights leader the Rev. Al Sharpton, whose . National Action Network organized the Washington rally. Marchers, including many parents with children, chanted 'No . justice, no peace, no racist police' and 'Hands up, don't . shoot.' Protesters carried signs that said 'All men are created . equal' and 'Black lives matter.' Relatives of Eric Garner and Akai Gurley, who were killed by . New York police, Brown and Trayvon Martin,slain by a Florida . neighborhood watchman in 2012, all took part in the Washington . rally . NYPD top brass are furious at de Blasio's implication that the beating may not have happened, claiming no such skepticism is ever shown when officers are accused of violence against civilians. NYPD has also released images of a number of witnesses to the assault who they hope will be able to secure a conviction. It is thought a number of the witnesses were using mobile phones to record the attack, while a man wearing a bright green baseball cap is believed to have been at the march as a legal observer for the National Lawyers Guild. This incident the latest controversy in a long-running stand off between New Yorkers and police following a spate of deaths in custody. They include the death of Eric Garner, a 43-year-old black man who died when officer Daniel Pantaleo attempted to subdue him in Tompkinsville, Staten Island, on July 17, with 'chokehold' restraining technique that is banned under NYPD protocol. Then, last week, a grand jury in Staten Island sparked global outrage after it refused to indict Pantaleo over the chokehold that killed the father-of-six. The confrontation began when Pantaleo arrested him for illegally selling cigarettes on the street. In the ensuing tussle, the officer put Garner in the controversial headlock moments before Garner was heard saying: 'I can't breathe.' They turned out to be the last words he ever spoke. He passed out and later died in hospital. His final words became a rallying cry for thousands of protesters who took to the streets in New York and other citiesafter Pantaleo escaped indictment.","Images of four men and three women released by NYPD .

"Terror atrocities committed by so-called 'lone-wolf' fanatics could be prevented by identifying and treating mental illness, new studies suggest. A growing body of research has found a significant link between psychological problems and extremist attacks - challenging decades of thinking that they play only a minor role. The studies looked at dozens of cases including a radical Muslim who killed a soldier outside Canada's Parliament, a right-wing extremist who opened fire on buildings in Texas and an Al Qaeda-inspired assailant who hacked an off-duty soldier to death in London. Police said all three were terrorists and motivated by ideology, while authorities and family members said they may have been mentally ill. But the latest body of research suggests they might well have been both. 'It's never an either-or in terms of ideology versus mental illness,' said Ramon Spaaij, a sociologist at Australia's Victoria University who conducted a major study, funded by the U.S. Justice Department, of lone wolf extremists. 'It's a dangerous cocktail.' Scroll down for video . Horror: A terrified hostage flees the Sydney hostage siege in Sydney on Monday after 'lone-wolf' gunman Man Haron Monis stormed a cafe while making a series of fanatical demands. New studies have found a link between mental illness and terror attacks which experts are now using to try to prevent future atrocities . Terrified: An injured hostage is carried out of a cafe in the central business district of Sydney after police stormed the building where a gunman had taken hostages and displayed an Islamic flag . Killer: Prime Minister Tony Abbott said the gunman — Iranian-born Man Haron Monis — had 'a long history of violent crime, infatuation with extremism and mental instability' Now academics and law enforcement officials are working to turn that research into tools to prevent deadly attacks. The study preceded Tuesday's end to a deadly 16-hour siege involving a gunman who took hostages in a cafe in Sydney. Prime Minister Tony Abbott said the gunman — Iranian-born Man Haron Monis — had 'a long history of violent crime, infatuation with extremism and mental instability.' With groups like Islamic State spreading violence in Syria and Iraq — and bloodthirsty rhetoric on the Internet — authorities around the world have issued increasingly insistent warnings about the threat posed by lone wolf attackers. They can be difficult to stop with a counterterrorism strategy geared toward intercepting communications and disrupting plots. A CCTV image shows Michael Zehaf-Bibeau running towards the Parliament buildings in Canada after shooting dead a soldier in October before he himself was shot dead by a parliament official . An Ottawa police officer runs with his weapon drawn outside Parliament Hill in Ottawa, Canada after a soldier standing guard at the National War Memorial was shot by gunman Michael Zehaf-Bibeau . After the attack by Michael Zehaf-Bibeau (above), Jocelyn Belanger, a psychology professor at the University of Quebec at Montreal, told the Canadian Senate's national security committee that 'to believe that radicalized individuals are crazy... will be our first mistake in developing effective counter-terrorism strategies' Solo terrorism 'doesn't take an awful lot of organizing. It doesn't take too many people to conspire together. There's no great complexity to it,' London Police Chief Bernard Hogan-Howe told the BBC recently. 'So what that means is that we have a very short time to interdict, to actually intervene and make sure that these people don't get away with it.' Police forces and intelligence agencies are examining whether insights from research by Spaaij and others could help. Spaaij said a number of law enforcement and intelligence agencies have shown interest in his work. In Britain, a police counterterrorism unit is using a major study of lone wolf terrorists to develop risk-assessment analysis. A British security official who spoke on condition of anonymity because he is not authorized to talk on the record said many attackers display warning signs, but that recognizing them is easier in retrospect. He said British intelligence officials are studying the link between mental illness and lone-actor terrorism. Most people with mental health problems are neither terrorists nor violent, and mental illness alone can't explain lone wolf attackers. Some experts dispute whether there is a link at all. After Michael Zehaf-Bibeau's deadly attack on a soldier October 22 in Ottawa, Jocelyn Belanger, a psychology professor at the University of Quebec at Montreal, told the Canadian Senate's national security committee that 'to believe that radicalized individuals are crazy or not playing with a full deck will be our first mistake in developing effective counterterrorism strategies.' But the new research suggests that solo terrorists are much more likely to have mental health problems than either members of the general public or participants in group terrorism. Spaaij and Mark Hamm of Indiana State University studied 98 lone wolf attackers in the U.S. They found that 40 per cent had identifiable mental health problems, compared with 1.5 percent in the general population. Their conclusion? Mental illness is not the only factor that drives individuals to commit terrorist acts, but it is one of the factors. Spaaj said mental illness can play a part 'in shaping particular belief systems and in constructing the enemy, externalizing blame for one's own failure or grievances onto this all-threatening enemy.' MI5 agents suggested that Michael Adebowale — who is now serving a life sentence in a psychiatric hospital for the murder of soldier Lee Rigby — be assessed by the agency's Behavioral Science Unit, a team of psychologists and social scientists, but the assessment was never done . A second study by Paul Gill and Emily Corner of University College London looked at 119 lone wolf attackers and a similar number of members of violent extremist groups in the U.S. and Europe. Almost a third of the lone wolves — nearly 32 percent — had been diagnosed with a mental illness, while only 3.4 percent of terrorist group members were mentally ill. 'Group-based terrorists are psychologically quite normal,' the researchers said. They said one reason may be that terrorist recruiters are likely to reject candidates who appear erratic or mentally ill. Mental illness could make lone wolf attacks easier to foresee: Gill said 60 percent of the attackers he studied leaked details of their plans, sometimes telling friends or family. He and Corner are working with a British counterterrorism unit as police try to develop ways of distinguishing genuine threats from hot-headed talk. The unit declined to discuss the project, but recent cases suggest determining who really is a threat is fraught with difficulty. More than a year before he hacked a soldier to death in London in 2013, Michael Adebowale's online extremism drew the attention of Britain's intelligence services. Domestic intelligence agency MI5 told a parliamentary inquiry into the murder that it uses a range of factors to assess the threat from potential lone wolves, including an inability to cope with stress and anxiety, social isolation and mental health problems. MI5 agents suggested that Adebowale — who is now serving a life sentence in a psychiatric hospital — be assessed by the agency's Behavioral Science Unit, a team of psychologists and social scientists, but the assessment was never done. The most lethal lone-wolf attacker in recent years was anti-Muslim extremist Anders Behring Breivik, who killed 77 people in a bombing and gun rampage in Norway in 2011 . Floral tributes and candles at the entrance to Oslo Cathedral in memory of the 76 people killed by Breivik . The lawmakers' report called that a missed opportunity, and recommended that 'MI5 should ensure that the unit's advice is integrated more thoroughly into investigations.' Signals also were misread in the case of Nicky Reilly, a 22-year-old convert to Islam who walked into a restaurant in the English town of Exeter in 2008 with a homemade bomb. The device went off in the restroom, injuring Reilly and no one else. At his trial, jurors were told that Reilly had learning difficulties and had had many years of contact with mental health services. In 2003, he talked to a psychiatrist about making a bomb. The information was passed on to the police, who judged that Reilly wasn't a serious threat. American authorities, in contrast, have been accused of being too aggressive in pursuit of lone attackers. The FBI has foiled several alleged attacks through sting operations in which agents posed as terror supporters, supplying advice and equipment. Critics say the strategy can amount to entrapment of mentally vulnerable people who wouldn't have the wherewithal to act alone. Meanwhile, the fundamental question of whether there is a link between mental health problems and terrorism remains controversial. The most lethal lone-wolf attacker in recent years was anti-Muslim extremist Anders Behring Breivik, who killed 77 people in a bombing and gun rampage in Norway in 2011. Breivik was unrepentant. One psychiatric report found him to be insane, while a second concluded that he was sane — and judges agreed, sending him to prison indefinitely. The killer was happy with the outcome. For Breivik, it was recognition that his views were legitimate and not those of a madman.","New studies challenge thinking that mental illness plays only a minor role .

She has been searching out deals and offers since January this year to save as much money as possible. Her 'addiction' to finding deals has allowed her to amass a huge haul of expensive and luxury presents for her mother, father and boyfriend Mitch. She said: 'I love getting a bargain - it is addictive. I have been preparing for this Christmas since the end of the last one - January sales are a great place to pick up bargains. 'I noticed lots of great deals in the shops and online about August so I made an effort to collect bits and bobs such as Gucci perfume, Body Shop toiletries and make up. 'I love the rush of getting a good bargain and I have been lucky enough to use my experience to help others save money. Her love of offers and coupons has led her to set up her own business advising others on how to save . 'I know it can seem a bit daunting to begin with, but with a little bit of effort serious savings can be made.' Ms Mumford made the huge savings by checking price comparison websites and as a result collected more presents than she needed for Christmas. After sorting out gifts for all of her family, she has even been able to donate £1,000 worth of presents to her local hospital. She said: 'It has been so nice to have Christmas sorted and not having to worry about being in debt or breaking the bank. 'I wanted to get high quality presents for my family and show that you can do it without spending a fortune. 'There is a misconception that everyone who does couponing only gets value products but through my careful shopping I have managed to purchase designer perfumes, a high end coffee machine and an Xbox One for a fraction of the recommended retail price.' Since starting saving money a year ago, Ms Mumford has quit her job working in Next to work full time as a 'couponer'.

She said: 'What started as a hobby to help me save money has turned into my life and I am able to run a business helping people save money. 'I know what it feels like to struggled as my ex-partner had a lot of debt which I took on for him. We were in a dire situation where every penny counted. 'That's what really spurred me on. I saw the Extreme Couponing programme on TV and I thought How are these Americans doing it? 'I thought there must be something here in the UK that can help me so I just went online, found a few sites and started from there and then it just grew.' Her bargain hunting is so successful she's managed to donate £1,000 worth of presents to her local hospital . She added: 'I want to show people that being a couponer isn't just about beings stingy or tight with money. I have managed to coupon luxury presents such as Gucci perfume, a coffee machine and Xbox and make up. 'I try and show people that it is just a little bit of work in the beginning but it will eventually pay off. One of the best things to do is just to be a bit forward thinking and save throughout the year.

"Scheme: Nicky Morgan has unveiled a multi-million pound initiative urging schools to give character-building the same weight as academic subjects . Schools are being urged to give character-building the same weight as academic subjects under a multi-million pound initiative unveiled by Nicky Morgan. The Education Secretary insisted that instilling resilience and ‘grit’ in pupils was just as important as helping them achieve good grades. She announced details of a £5million fund aimed at helping schools offer classes and activities which foster traits such as self-control, commitment, endeavour and humour. The Department for Education said the scheme was intended ‘to place character education on a par with academic learning for pupils across the country’. The move marks a shift in focus following major reforms to the school curriculum which came into force earlier this year. It follows warnings from business leaders and Ofsted that school-leavers are ill-equipped for the workplace and lack professional attitudes to time-keeping, team-working and communication. Mrs Morgan has already announced £5million to be spent on projects which aim to harness the military values of respect, leadership and discipline to improve behaviour and achievement. However the new emphasis on character-building being encouraged in schools has prompted concerns in some quarters that core academic subjects could be squeezed. Mrs Morgan insisted that developing traits such as perseverance in the face of setbacks, confident debating skills and community spirit were ‘equally important’ to pupils as securing good grades. The scheme was a ‘milestone in preparing young people more than ever before for life in modern Britain’. ‘It will provide a boost to those already doing great work, while also helping excellent projects get off the ground,’ she said. ‘Excellent teachers already produce well-rounded pupils and today’s news will give more schools the support, inspiration and resources to go even further.’ The initiative would turn England into a ‘global leader in teaching character and resilience’, she said. Under the scheme, schools and community groups will bid for a share of a £3.5million pot to run character-building initiatives. Projects can be based either inside or outside school but must provide evidence they will boost results, behaviour or job prospects. A further £500,000 will be used to fund prizes for schools which excel in character-building in an attempt to encourage heads across the country to offer a broader education within existing budgets. An additional £1million will be invested in research into the most effective ways of teaching character. True Grit: John Wayne in the famous Western. Mrs Morgan insisted developing traits such as perseverance in the face of setbacks, debating skills and community spirit were ‘equally important’ to pupils as good grades . Ministers are also holding up a series of examples of successful projects already underway in a bid to inspire more schools to embrace the idea. These include King Solomon Academy, in north west London, which has introduced ‘character-based rewards’ for good behaviour and effort. It has also introduced productions of unabridged Shakespeare plays for pupils aged 11 upwards. Meanwhile School 21, a free school in Stratford, east London has developed a rich well-being curriculum that stresses the importance of self-control, humour and charity. The school day includes time for students to ‘master’ personal goals, such as grammar, an instrument or a language. It has identified 21 qualities as attributes of a successful student and provides leadership and debating classes to enhance pupil’s assertiveness and public speaking skills. And at Outwood Academy Portland, in Worksop, Notts, more than 100 after-school classes are offered ranging from extra English and maths to an orchestra, choir and debating club. In a dramatic turnaround, the school has won an ‘outstanding’ Ofsted rating having been among the worst in the country just over two years ago. Principal Dr Phillip Smith says the introduction of a broad range of extra-curricular activities has been instrumental in the school’s success.","Nicky Morgan unveiled £5million fund to offer character-building classes .

"A petition to expediate the toughening of bail laws has received 79,000 signatures in the hours after the Sydney siege, in which the gunman was free despite facing sex assault and murder-related charges. Sarah Langston woke up on Tuesday morning to the horror of the siege at the Lindt cafe in Sydney, which resulted in the death of two innocent victims, and news that the gunman had been allowed to walk the streets despite his sketchy past. A survivor of both a random vicious attack and domestic violence, the 31-year-old started a petition once learning Man Haron Monis received bail after being charged with accessory to his ex-wife's murder. This decision was made despite Monis having 40 outstanding sexual assault charges and prior convictions - for writing malicious letters to the families of Australian soldiers who died in Afghanistan. Scroll down for video . Sarah Langston, a survivor of both a random vicious attack and domestic violence, has started a petition calling for bail laws to be toughened . Man Haron Monis inside the Lindt cafe in Sydney where he held 17 people hostage and was eventually shot dead by police more than 16 hours later . Ms Langston, a pre-school teacher, put the petition together with her friend, early childhood academic Dr Miriam Giugni, to call for stronger bail laws. 'Bail laws were meant to have been changed already, but 'administrative bungles' have stalled them until late January. That’s not good enough,' the petition says. 'We need stronger bail laws that would have kept this dangerous man behind bars right now. 'The public deserves to be protected from violent criminals.' NSW Attorney General Brad Hazzard said the government will conduct an investigation into the judicial system and why Monis was released from custody. While NSW Premier Mike Baird said the bail laws could be tightened during the investigation of the new new risk-based system which came into force in May when Greg Smith was the state's Attorney General. The controversial laws include removing the presumption of no bail for offenders with string of of serious offences. Amirah Droudis (left)  and Man Haron Monis (right) were both released on bail because the prosecution case against them for the death of Monis' ex-wife was considered 'weak' Hostages breaking free from the aiege at the Kindt cafe at 2am on Tuesday but two did not make it out alive .

On December 12 last year,Monis and his partner, Amirah Droudis were released on bail following the charges involving his ex-wife Noleen Hayson Pal's murder. Amendments to the new bail laws were expected to be introduced at the end of January but Ms Langston questions the proposed changes. 'Is what is going to come in January going to be enough and will it stay in place?' she said. The siege saga felt too close to home for Ms Langston, who was randomly and viciously attacked just 200 metres from her front door in Sydney's inner west in 2012. 'He attacked me from behind - I was thrown to the ground and strangled and smothered - it was terrifying and very traumatic,' she told Daily Mail Australia. 'But I also feel lucky to have got away and grateful to be alive.' A petition calls for tighter bail restrictions to avoid any similar tragedies in the future . Ms Langston believes that repeated violence offenders were let off too lightly in NSW. 'I was quite horrified when I woke up to discover he had 40 outstanding sexual assault charges but his bail had been continued,' she said. 'The system is failing - there needs to be changes to the decision-making process.' Ms Langston was pleasantly surprised at how quickly people jumped on board the campaign. 'I didn't expect this many signatures in a day,' she said. 'I think it tapped into a vein for people who feel really disturbed by what has happened after being let down by the justice system.' 'It shows that people genuinely care which is a great thing to take away from all of this.' Ms Langston says the new bail laws is a serious failure in the justice sytsem .","79,000 people have signed petition urging the bail laws to be changed now .

"Hundreds of mourners have filled Sydney's St Mary's Cathedral to attend an official memorial mass for siege victims on their lunch break, where they were told 'hell has touched us'. Sydney Archbishop Anthony Fisher OP addressed people in the packed cathedral including Australian Governor General Peter Cosgrove,   Communications Minister Malcolm Turnbull and his wife Lucy and NSW Premier Mike Baird. On Tuesday afternoon Archbishop Fisher spoke to the congregation about the horrific 16-hour siege that happened in the Lindt cafe, just two blocks away from St Mary's Cathedral in the CBD. Scroll down for video . Archbishop of Sydney Anthony Fisher celebrates a mass to rememeber victims of the Martin Place siege . Minister for Communications Malcolm Turnbull attended the service, and broke down in tears outside . Hostages were forced to hold up a flag with Arabic writing inside the Lindt cafe during a 16-hour siege . 'Hostages were pinned for hours against the windows, forced to hold up a flag which blasphemously used the name of God as a threat,' Archbishop Fisher said. 'The distress was visible on their faces, as was relief the first time they escaped.' Some congregation members had to brace themselves on the cathedral pews as they wept uncontrollably. Dignitaries including NSW Deputy Premier Tony Grant, NSW Transport Minister Gladys Berejiklian, NSW Planning Minister Pru Goward and NSW Attorney General Brad Hazzard were also among those in attendance. Archbishop Fisher said Sydney was not used to hearing words like 'siege', 'hostages' and 'security forces' associated with the city. 'Yet for the past day and night we have been subjected to pictures and sounds we tend to associate with faraway lands, he said. 'Hell has touched us.' The victims of the siege at the Lindt cafe were Katrina Dawson (left), 38, and Tori Johnson (right), 38 . New South Wales Premier Mike Baird was also in attendance at the mass, after laying flowers at Martin Place . Australian Governor General Peter Cosgrovewas among the dignitaries at St Mary's Cathedral on Tuesday . Archbishop Fisher also praised the bravery of victims Katrina Dawson, 38, and Tori Johnson, 34, who died trying to protect others from gunman Man Haron Monis's shots. 'Tragically [the gun] went off, killing [Johnson],' he said. 'But he triggered the response of the police and eventual freedom for most of the hostages. 'Reports have also emerged that Katrina Dawson was shielding her pregnant friend from gunfire. 'These heroes were willing to lay down their lives so others might live.' But Archbishop Fisher warned Australians against becoming ‘cautious’ or ‘suspicious’ of our neighbours. ‘In the process we would undermine what we love most about our country and its way of life,’ he said. Mr Turnbull broke down in tears outside the cathedral, while talking about the 'shocking incident' Hundreds of people have left flowers at Martin Place as a sign of respect on Tuesday . Outside the cathedral, Mr Turnbull broke down in tears as he paid tribute to the victims of what he described as a 'shocking incident'. 'I was on a train this morning and you could feel the numbness in the carriage,' Mr Turnbull said following the mass. 'Everyone was thinking the same thoughts of shock and horror, imagining how those people suffered during that terrible night. 'Thinking about the courage of the two young people that were killed.' Mr Turnbull added that he thought the service reminded Australians to be 'full of love'. 'It's love for each other, it's love for our country, it's that what binds us together and makes us the most successful, harmonious multicultural society in the world,' he said. 'I thought today's service was so beautiful because it was all about love, that love of God... that should inspire us all not to be corrupted by hatred and violence and to remain united as Australians now and forever.'","Hundreds of mourners filled Sydney's St Mary's Cathedral for memorial .

"A Massachusetts doctor cured of Ebola says he's returning in January to Liberia, the West African country where he contracted the virus, to continue working at a medical mission. Dr. Richard Sacra, 51,  said he plans to spend about four weeks at the same clinic outside Monrovia where he has served for more than 20 years. Sacra contracted Ebola in August and underwent treatment at an Omaha, Nebraska, hospital. He returned to Massachusetts on Sept. 25. Former Ebola patient Dr. Richard Sacra seen speaking in a news conference at the Nebraska Medical Center in Omaha, Neb., in September . Sacra is a University of Massachusetts Medical School faculty member. He says doctors have said he is now immune to Ebola. Sacra made the comments following a Tuesday news conference in Boston announcing a $1 million state grant to help develop a faster, more accurate test for diagnosing Ebola. In the fight against Ebola in Sierra Leone, officials are planning a house-to-house search for hidden Ebola cases in the capital and surrounding areas in an effort to stem the disease's rampant spread, the government said Tuesday. The government has periodically restricted movements into and out of hot spots in order to slow Ebola infections. Dr. Richard Sacra is seen working in Liberia before he got sick - he was the third American doctor reported to have contracted the Ebola virus while treating the African breakout . In September, it locked down the entire country to look for sick people. With the disease now spreading fastest in Sierra Leone, authorities are ramping up their response. In a statement Tuesday, President Ernest Bai Koroma said officials will begin a house-to-house search Wednesday for sick people in the Western Area, which includes Freetown. It was not clear, however, if people had to stay in their homes and, if so, for how long. More than half of new infections are now occurring in the capital and its surrounding areas, the statement said. In the world's largest Ebola outbreak, around 18,500 people have been infected, mostly in Sierra Leone, Guinea and Liberia. Of those, more than 6,800 have died. Dr. Richard Sacra pictured being treated at the Nebraska Medical Center in Omaha, Nebraska . In Mali officials have released from quarantine the last 13 people being monitored for Ebola, and the country could be declared free of the virus next month if no further cases are recorded, the World Health Organization said today. The epidemic has overwhelmed the health systems in Sierra Leone, Guinea and Liberia, where there were too few doctors and nurses to begin with. Hundreds of foreign health workers have flooded into the region to help. Another 187 from Ethiopia have left for the three countries, the African Union said Tuesday. The AU has promised 1,000 health workers from its member states to combat Ebola.","Dr. Richard Sacra, 51, has served more than 20 years at a clinic outside Monrovia .

"Care home boss Victoria Phillips (pictured) was jailed for a year after admitting stealing £5,000 - including money meant for elderly residents . A care home manager who stole money meant to pay for vulnerable residents' haircuts and gifts donated to staff, was behind bars today. Victoria Phillips was jailed for a year after she helped herself to nearly £5,000 while running Alfreton Residential Home in Prenton, Merseyside. Liverpool Crown Court heard that she breached the trust placed in her to target vulnerable residents who could 'ill-afford to lose what they did.' Phillips, who forged documentation to try and cover her tracks,  stole donations to the home, money for residents' haircuts and 'thank you' gifts to staff. She admitted 12 counts of theft totaling £4,821 between October, 2009, and October last year. Judge Mark Brown said: 'It's clear that these offences involved the breach of a high degree of trust, given in particular the important position of responsibility that you had within the home. 'In one instance, you stole a relatively significant amount of money from the bank account of an elderly resident. 'On one occasion, you pocketed money that had been donated to the home by well-meaning individuals who no doubt wished to improve the conditions in which residents were living. 'On other occasions, you pocketed relative small amounts of cash intended as thank you presents to members of staff for the good work that they had performed. 'There were occasions when you pocketed small amounts of money that were set aside for sundries, such as residents having their hair attended to.' The judge said Phillips, who pleaded guilty to theft, committed 'mean and nasty offences' over a significant period of time. He added: 'In effect, you were stealing from elderly residents, elderly victims, who could possibly ill-afford to lose what they did and people whom the public would expect would be cared for properly. You as a manager had the duty to ensure that was the position'. Phillips admitted 12 counts of theft while working at at Alfreton Residential Home, in Prenton, Merseyside . Eleven of the charges involved sums of money that ranged from £50 to £2,000 and belonged to various named people. During September, 2012, she also took £900 belonging to the care home. Phillips resigned in October last year. John Ballam, defending, said mum-of-one Phillips acted out of 'need rather than greed' after enduring financial struggles. He said she was in thrall to a violent ex-husband and was 'fearful' of telling him of their money issues. He said: 'She has ex- pressed considerable re-morse and shame. She was a caring person, she would like to think she still is, but she committed very nasty offences against these people and she thoroughly regrets that.'","Victoria Phillips was the manager of Alfreton Residential Home in Prenton .

"A 21-year-old man diagnosed with severe autism has been moved to supported accommodation after his parents launched a petition to remove him from a hospital in North Melbourne. James Pascoe, who suffers from high levels of anxiety and trauma, was chained to a hospital bed on and off for 25 days, one of which was his 21st birthday. Parents Bronwyn and Allan Padscoe created an online petition last month that amassed over 66,000 signatures, asking the government to help move their son somewhere with more adequate support. Scroll down for video . James Pascoe has been moved to supported accommodation after his parents launched a petition to remove him from a hospital in North Melbourne, wherehe was chained to a bed for 25 days . This week, the parents have revealed that James has been removed from The Northern Hospital in Epping, and taken to supported accommodation. Mrs Pascoe voiced her relief wrote on the petition site, thanking everyone who supported the cause. ‘We're so relieved to tell you that the government have listened. James is now out of hospital, in supported accommodation – and unshackled from that awful bed.' 'Thank you so much to all 66,000 of you who've signed our change.org petition. This wouldn't of happened without your help.' 'For once, today is a good day. We can finally start help James get his life back on track now that he's in supported accommodation. Mrs Pascoe's mother had been a role model for James and a care giver who he adored, but passed away from pancreatic cancer when James was 16. 'When my mum passed away in 2012 James started showing outbursts of behaviour, and wasn't coping. He withdrew and became depressed and became obsessed with the fact that people died,' Mrs Pascoe told Daily Mail Australia. 'He kept reliving losing her and was haunted by the fact that his baby sister had died at only a few weeks old, and this developed into real trauma,' she said. James's sister Jacinta died at only four and half weeks old, an event which still distresses him, and made the deaths of his grandparents more acute and created a fear of hospitals and death. James has severe autism and spent his 21st birthday shackled to a hospital bed despite his parent's desperate pleas to healthcare authorities who they say have failed him . James (centre) with his mother Bronwyn (left) and father Allan (right). Mrs Pasco voiced her relief that the government had stepped in to move James to supported accomodation . After a long battle to develop in-home care that would meet James's growing needs, the Pascoe's were finally told that if he became aggressive that they would have to resort to calling the police. 'We didn't want to do that, we wanted to have help in our home that would mean we could work with him and provide therapy so he learnt how to deal with his anxiety and anger,' Mrs Pascoe said. After struggling to control James's outbursts and teach him how to deal with his emotions, James's behaviour continued to escalate and his parents made the heartbreaking decision to phone the police. 'He couldn't even go in the ambulance to hospital because he was scared that he would die, everyone who had been taken away in an ambulance died,' Mrs Pascoe said. Since then, Mrs Pascoe said her son has been through a cycle of being shackled and sedated over the past two years, in and out of respite houses, care facilities, and the hospital, with no treatment plans for the grief and trauma he was experiencing from the bewildering experiences. Mrs Pascoe said that there was an incident where the family received a letter informing them they were removing him to a facility without consent, despite weeks of negotiations. 'When I went to visit him in the respite home he was all over me, really touchy-feely because he was alone there, all by himself, with no physical contact. The carers wouldn't talk to him or interact with him and he was deprived of sensory experiences,' she said. A spokesperson from the Department of Human Services said that it was not policy to leave a client in isolation, and that the Department had been working consistently towards finding a solution that was appropriate and were seeking to address James's needs. 'Had someone worked with us we would never have gotten into cycle. This is bureaucracy gone mad, getting police to deal with our children instead of helping them through grief and loss,' said Mrs Pascoe . James's parents said they have exhausted themselves begging for funding to keep him at home to give him the support and therapy he needs . Mrs Pascoe said her son has been through a cycle of being shackled and sedated over the past two years, in and out of respite houses, care facilities, and the hospital with no treatment plans for the grief and trauma he was experiencing from the bewildering experiences . James's parents said they have exhausted themselves begging for funding to keep him at home to give him the support and therapy he needs with healthcare professionals who know his case and are familiar with him. 'The problem is the system has put him into a cycle of trauma- he'll feel safe and secure and then be sent back to square one,' Mrs Pascoe said. 'I'm sure if he had normal abilities they wouldn’t be able to treat him like that,' she said. The Pascoe's believe that the lack of understanding about autism and the level of ignorance even within the Department of Human Services has resulted in her son living in a constant state of fear and anxiety. The depression and anger he exhibited only continued, exacerbated by a system which James's family claims refuses to act until their situation reaches a crisis point, and he is shackled and heavily sedated to the point of terror. 'I feel so powerless because we can't do anything, and it's heartbreaking that we cant have him home because we haven’t got the funding,' Mrs Pascoe said. 'Had someone worked with us we would never have gotten into cycle. This is bureaucracy gone mad, getting police to deal with our children instead of helping them through grief and loss is not the way to go,' she said. On November 21, James was taken to hospital after acting out at a centre in the city of Whittlesea. The Department of Human Services reportedly has other policies for dealing with such situations, and while calling the police was one option which might be used if needed, it was not the only one available. Other approaches which could be used such as dimming lights, talking in soft voices, and withdrawing from the room. James has spent the past fortnight strapped down in Northern Hospital, and his mother said he has been given heavy doses of drugs to prevent him from escaping. A spokesperson from the Department of Human Services said 'James was admitted to the Northern Hospital by his family. His family and a consulting physician are making decisions about his care while in hospital,' 'While several options for support have been offered for James’ long term care, these options have not so far been accepted by his family.' 'The department will continue to work with James and his family to make sure he gets appropriate and quality care.' James's baby sister died at only four and a half weeks old, an event which distresses him still . James's parents Bronwyn and Allan say that their son has high levels of anxiety and that hospitals scare him . 'He is a prisoner in that room, he isn't allowed cant go out because they can't risk it, and he doesn’t get to see daylight, he's maintained in one room,' Mrs Pascoe said. 'Prisoners actually get treated better, and why should he have less because he's an autistic child? He had no choice in the matter,' she said. 'He has a right to be safe and secure and not be labelled as a problem to society,' she said. 'I didn't want to use James, but I had to tell his story and put it out there because it was the only way to reach to the community, so people know what has happened to people with autism,' she said. 'James needs a voice to show whats happened to him. If we don’t start getting it right we’ll have an epidemic,' 'People relinquish their kids because they get exhausted with the system crying for help. It's meant to protect the vulnerable instead of treating them like non-humans.'","Bronwyn and Allan Pascoe created a petition on change.org to remove their son James from The Northern Hospital in Melbourne .

"A US Army Lieutenant who deserted to join the French Foreign Legion has been jailed for four years following a court martial. Second Lieutenant Lawrence Franks, 28, graduated in second place from West Point military academy in 2008 before deserting the following year. Lt Franks vanished from Fort Drum in New York state in 2009 and despite a massive search of nearby woods, there was no sign of any body. Lieutenant Lawrence Franks, pictured deserted the US Army only a year after graduating from West Point . Lt Franks, centre rear,  enlisted in the French Foreign Legion in March 2009 for five years . It later emerged that Lt Franks abandoned his post and flew to Paris before joining the French Foreign Legion. He completed a five-year tour of duty under the assumed name Christopher Flaherty. At the end of his contract, he left the Foreign Legion and handed himself over the US Army in Germany, where he was sent back to the United States. Neither the US Army or his family knew what happened to Lt Franks until he handed himself into authorities earlier this year. The New York Times reported that  Lt Franks was found guilty of conduct unbecoming of an officer and desertion as well as an intention to shirk his planned deployment to Afghanistan. However, Lt Franks said that he did not want to wait 12 months for his own planned deployment. The 28-year-old former solider claimed he felt suicidal and would have shot himself if he had remained at Fort Drum. Lt Franks said in an interview with the paper: 'I needed to be wet and cold and hungry. I needed the grueling life I could only find in a place like the Legion.” 'I feel really bad for the pain I put on my family, the disruption to my unit. But I don’t regret what I did — any of it, good or bad — because it saved my life. Lt Franks, pictured, was jailed for four years after being found guilty of deserting the US Army .

Lt Franks said he had actively considered killing himself before leaving for France. He said he was planning an accident on the pistol range. However, a phone call to his family in March 2009 changed his mind and instead he decided to join the French Foreign Legion. Retired Army psychiatrist Brigadier General Stephen Xanakis told the court martial that Lt Franks knew it was wrong to desert the US Army, but he considered suicide to have been a bigger sin.","Lieutenant Lawrence Franks graduated from West Point in 2008 .

"When a lobster turned up a conservation centre filled with eggs and missing both its claws and half of its legs, prospects looked bleak. But in an extraordinary quirk of nature the lobster managed to regrow its four missing legs as well as its distinctive claws in record time. Dubbed Clawdia, the lobster shocked staff at the National Lobster Hatchery in Cornwall by regrowing her limbs in just one moult - the regeneration process of lobsters. Clawdia the lobster was missing four arms and both claws and managed to grow them all in one process . The crustacean regnerated four of her legs and both her claws in a single moult after four months at the centre . Ben Marshall, a senior technician at the centre, said: 'She was brought in by one of the fishermen as she was full of eggs. 'We put her in our hatchery, as we do with all our lobsters. But she wasn't in a very good condition and was missing half of her legs. 'But luckily she has moulted in a reasonable amount of time. There appeared not only all legs but also two perfect little claws.' Clawdia came to the hatchery about four months ago and will be kept thee until the new year when her shell has hardened again. This becomes soft during the regeneration process. Mr Marshall said being able to see her regrow so many limbs was very unique. 'It's very unusual,' he added. 'It's not unusual for lobsters to regenerate but they usually do this in the sea. But we were able to actually witness this. She grew everything back all at once.' Clawdia the lobster was brought into the hatchery in Cornwall heavily laden with legs and missing vital limbs . Mr Marshall said Clawdia was likely to have lost her limbs and her claws by fighting other lobsters, which is common among the crustaceans. Carly Daniels a scientist at the facility added: 'We've never seen anything quite like this. 'She may have lost the limbs fighting or from a predator attack. 'But to regrow them all so fast is amazing.' Bob Bayet, director of the Lobster Institute at the University of Maine, said: 'Lobsters can regenerate their limbs. It will take several moults and years to obtain full size.' Lobsters grow by shedding their exoskeleton which is known as moulting. As this happens their body tissues absorb water and they swell, rupturing the exoskeleton. When this occurs a new exoskeleton begins to harden - a process that can take from a few hours to several weeks. During each moult the length of a lobster increases by up to 15 per cent and its weight can double. Lobsters can regrow their limbs by moulting . After a successful moult the lobster eats its old exoskeleton, giving the animal the calcium it needs to harden its new shell. Appendages and limbs can be regenerated through the moulting period but this can make it last longer. Young lobsters can moult up to five times a year whereas for adults this may take place every two years. All lobsters continue to grow throughout their lives.","Lobster laden with eggs was missing both claws and four of her legs .

"For most brides-to-be, the biggest challenge when shopping for a wedding dress is finding a style on budget. But for Rebekah Gregory, just standing in the fitting room presented a struggle. A survivor of the 2013 Boston Marathon bombing, Rebekah, 27, from Houston, Texas, was left with a severely injured leg. But with her wedding on the horizon, she allowed TLC's Say Yes to the Dress to chart her search for the perfect gown a month before the big day.

"The principal and vice principal of the Connecticut school at the center of a teacher-student sex scandal will not be returning to their positions for failing to report the relationship. Former Stamford High School Principal Donna Valentine says she discovered 32-year-old English teacher Danielle Watkins was sleeping with one of her 18-year-old students at the end of the last school year, but did not comply with her legal obligation to report the relationship within 12 hours. In fact, neither she nor assistant principal Roth Nordin, who also allegedly became aware of the relationship, ever reported the incident to  police or child services. Watkins was arrested over the summer when her victim went to the police. Earlier this month, the married mother pleaded guilty to charges of second-degree sexual assault and risk of injury to a minor, sending her behind bars for the next four years. Scroll down for video . No return: Stamford High School Principal Donna Valentine (left) and Assistant Principal Roth Nordin (right) will not be returning to their positions at the Connecticut school after it was revealed they knew about a teacher's affair with a student and failed to report the crime. Pictured above in court in October . New jobs: Valentine admitted to learning about the affair at the end of the last school year, but did not report the relationship as she is legally obligated . On Monday, schools Superintendent Winifred Hamilton (pictured) says both Valentine and Nordin will be transferred to work at another school . At a press conference on Monday, schools Superintendent Winifred Hamilton announced that neither Valentine, 62, or Nordin, 59, would be returning to Stamford High School for their role in concealing the affair. Both have been on paid leave since their arrest in October, when it was revealed that they knew about Watkin's relationship with the student, who was just 17 when he started having sex with his teacher. Allegedly one of the boy's guardians came into the school last February to tell administrators she thought it was inappropriate Watkins had been picking the student up in her car often. Guilty: English teacher Danielle Watkins pleaded guilty earlier this month to charges of second-degree sexual assault and risk of injury to a minor for her nine-month-long relationship with an 18-year-old student . And administrators allegedly knew that Watkins threatened to give the boy a failing grade, when he tried to break off the relationship. They two administrators were accepted into the state's Accelerated Rehabilitation program which will see their charges dismissed if completed. But neither will lose their jobs, thanks to their teachers union. Instead they will be transferred to other positions within the district. 'Under the collective-bargaining agreement, as Superintendent, I have the right to involuntarily transfer administrators,' Hamilton said, not confirming where either administrator will be placed. A third administrator at the school, assistant principal Angela Thomas-Graves, was also placed on administrative leave recently for possibly knowing about the relationship as well. The city has hired a retired judge to oversee an internal investigation into the school 's handling of the sex scandal, which is expected to be completed in February. However, an investigation may not be enough to comfort parents in the district. 'It's going to take a long time for parents to trust the school again because it's just unbelievable what happened,' Stamford High School parent Bin Li told WFSB. Meanwhile, Watkins will be officially sentenced on January 22 for her crimes, and the school district is now putting her on unpaid leave and working to get her teacher's license revoked with the Commissioner of Education. According to the terms of her plea deal, Watkins will be placed on the state's  Sex Offender Registry for 10 years. Watkins, who is married with two young children, also allegedly bought marijuana for the student and a 15-year-old friend - whom she also taught - and let him drive her car while knowing he did not have a license. Her two students smoked the drug during school hours, sometimes on school grounds, the older boy told police. On June 26, three days after telling the counselor about the affair, he went to Stamford Police to make a statement about the relationship. The 15-year-old boy also gave a statement to police. On June 27, police officers pulled over Watkins' car and inside they found marijuana and a cell phone, which contained evidence she had sent naked photos of herself to the boy. Family: According to pictures posted online, Watkins appears to be married and a mother. She will be sentenced on January 22, and is expected to receive a four-year prison sentence . Lt. Diedrich Hohn, in charge of the case, told MailOnline that she was 'hostile' and 'verbally combative' during the search. As cops pulled her over, she had tried to hide her cellphone under the passenger seat, he said. Watkins allegedly exchanged more than 2,000 text messages and hundreds of phone calls with the teenager. Address records show Watkins, lives with a man, Jermaine, whom she is believed to be married to. Facebook images suggest they have two children together. She was also arrested earlier this year in her home town of Norwalk after prescription pills were found in her car after a minor accident. Neighbors say the married mother-of-two then went into rehab.","Stamford High School Principal Donna Valentine and assistant principal Roth Nordin knew about teacher's nine-month relationship with student .

"Hundreds of women have been inspired to take on the epic 2,600-mile Pacific Crest Trail (PCT) detailed in author Cheryl Strayed's book Wild, and its newly-released big screen adaptation starring Reese Witherspoon. According to a spokesperson from the PCT Association, there has been a huge influx of inquiries from would-be hikers eager to follow in the footsteps of the best-selling author and attempt the mammoth trek, which stretches from the US border with Mexico up to the Canadian border. 'We've had a lot of calls from people who have said 'I've read the book and I really want to do [the trek],' the PCT Association's Liz Bergeron told NBC News. 'Starting a new life': Jessica Reynolds is training for the trek, which she hopes to complete at least a portion of in the Spring . Inspiration: Jessica received a copy of Cheryl Strayed's book from her mother for Christmas and admits she found the story incredibly empowering . But Ms Bergeron added that the increased number of hikers starting out on the tricky and often dangerous path has also meant an increase in the number of accidents. She explained: 'We are really stressing that people be prepared in order to cut down on the possibility of a rescue.' Both Strayed's book and the recently-released movie clearly depict the dangers involved in attempting to tackle the trail; at one point the then 26-year-old former heroin addict has a close encounter with a wild bear, while another passage describes her desperate attempt to cross a treacherous snow-covered mountain without any of the proper equipment. In fact, the novice hiker readily admitted how ill-prepared she was for her lonely adventure, which saw her cover 1,100 miles of the PCT over several months. Having packed an assortment of bulky equipment and personal items - including a number of weighty books and journals - before starting the trek, she then added a staggering 24.5 pounds of water to the weighty backpack, which she later christened 'Monster' thanks to its impressive bulk. Strayed also braved sweltering temperatures of up to 100 degrees at some points along the trail, before being plunged into freezing conditions when she reached the mountains. Having walked hundreds of miles in a pair of boots that were one size too small, Strayed was then forced to duct-tape some sandals in the hopes of protecting her feet from the hazardous conditions. The pursuit of happiness: Black Jack dealer Linda Blaney said that, during her trek, she discovered that she is 'the one person who makes herself happy' Determination: The 52-year-old believes that anyone can complete the trail, if they have enough motivation . And in addition to the hazardous environmental conditions and numerous problems with her equipment, Strayed also had to face the dangers posed by other hikers she met along the way. At one campsite, she fled from a pair of men who made threatening comments about her appearance and the fact that she was alone, while at another point a couple running a campsite threw her off their land because she was unable to pay their camping fees. But, surprisingly, none of that has stopped scores of women from wanting to experience the journey for themselves. 'After I read her book, I got the maps,' Las Vegas-based Black Jack dealer Linda Blaney told NBC. 'After reading what she went through, I knew that anybody could do the trail. 'I found out that I'm the one person who makes myself happy.' Jessica Reynolds, who is currently training to take on a portion of the trail this coming Spring, added that she was inspired to try her hand at the lengthy trek after her mother gave her a copy of Strayed's book. Inside the cover of the copy is written: 'To Jess, Love Mom. May you find your own journey.' Star quality: Reese Witherspoon's performance in the recently-released big screen adaptation of Wild has already earned her a number of award nominations . Where it all started: Strayed first set out on the mammoth trek when she was just 26 . 'It makes your own personal struggles and problems seem so small,' Jessica explained. 'Starting a new life for her was finding herself on this trail and I kind of was in that same point in my life. 'It's such an empowering story for women. It will encourage a lot of people to find themselves on a trail, hiking versus other forms of therapy.' Bob Mayon, caretaker at a hikers' rest stop called Hiker Town, revealed that he has seen a huge surge in the numbers of people passing through on their way to completing the PCT - and added that the popularity of the trail will likely increase thanks to the release of Wild the movie. 'We had 700 hikers last year,' he revealed. Earlier this week activewear brand REI announced that it has re-released the Danner Mountain Light Cascade boot, a replica of the original footwear Strayed wore during her own hike. The shoes, which famously appears on the cover of the 2012 book, come in 'the exact box used in 1995 when she set off to hike 1,100 miles of the Pacific Crest Trail' and will retail for $299 per pair. The new shoes, a tribute to the iconic style originally introduced in the 1970s, were custom-made for Reese to wear in the movie.","The 46-year-old's book has been turned into a movie starring Reese Witherspoon, which was released earlier this month .

"More cycles of IVF were undertaken in the UK last year than ever before - but there has been no rise in the success rate, figures released today show. They reveal more than two-thirds of women undergoing treatment are aged 37 and under, while the average age for treatment remains static at 35. Women over 40 represent the minority of all patients treated, with women aged over 45 accounting for just two per cent of treatment. The report, from the UK's fertility watchdog, also shows that the majority of these older women are using donor eggs rather than their own when trying to conceive. Nearly 50,000 women underwent a total of 64,600 cycles of IVF in the UK last year, new figures show . In 2013, 49,636 women had a total of 64,600 cycles of IVF, more than ever before. And a further 2,379 women had a total of 4,611 cycles of donor insemination - also up from the previous year. However the overall success rate has remained constant at around 25 per cent, according to the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (HFEA). The new figures also reflect changes in society. The number of IVF treatment cycles involving same-sex female couples has increased by nearly 20 per cent year-on-year, rising from 766 treatments in 2011 to 902 in 2012. Meanwhile, donor insemination cycles involving same-sex couples rose by nearly 15 per cent, from 1,271 in 2011 to 1,458 in 2012. However these amount to a minority of all treatments undertaken, the HFEA said. The report also shows that the number of IVF treatment cycles using both donor eggs and donor sperm has doubled over the last five years, while the use of frozen embryos is now involved in more than 20 per cent of all treatments. Elsewhere, the campaign to reduce multiple births is shown to have had good impact, with numbers declining. Having a multiple birth (twins, triplets or more) is the single greatest health risk associated with fertility treatment, so guidelines now state only a single embryo can be transferred at a time. Multiple births carry risks to both the health of the mother and to the health of the unborn babies, with twins or triplets more likely to be premature and to have a below-normal birth weight. The report shows that multiple births occurred in 16.9 per cent of treatment cycles in 2012, down from 18.8 per cent in 2011. Sally Cheshire, Chair of the HFEA, said: 'This report offers unrivalled insight into one of the world's most advanced IVF sectors, helping to inform the decisions of patients and clinicians alike. 'We are very pleased to see that outcomes in most categories are improving each year, and are particularly heartened by the continuing downward trend in multiple births, something we've worked hard with professionals to achieve. 'But as well as providing data, over time these reports offer us a unique insight into the changing nature of social norms, whether that is same-sex parenting or older mums. 'In that sense they have become a fascinating resource not just for patients and clinicians, but for everyone.' Today's report also revealed the campaign to reduce multiple births is having a good impact, with the numbers declining. Multiple births carry risks to both the health of the mother and to the health of the unborn babies, with twins or triplets more likely to be premature and to have a below-normal birth weight . Commenting on the figures, Professor Sheena Lewis, Chair of the British Andrology Society, and Professor of Reproductive Medicine, Queen's University Belfast (QUB), said: 'It is very disappointing that success rates have not improved, yet again. 'In my opinion, one of the reasons for the low success rate is an unsatisfactory diagnosis of the male partner. 'We should test the man's sperm at a molecular level, looking at his sperm DNA quality to help guide couples to the best treatment for them.' Dr Allan Pacey, a fertility expert from the University of Sheffield, added: 'The data shows that treatments such as IVF are now very much in the mainstream of UK medical practice. 'IVF is now performed more frequently than other well-know procedures such as having tonsils removed (there were 47,141 of those in the NHS in 2012-13). 'Therefore, it remains disappointing that in many parts of the NHS Assisted Conception is still a Cinderella Service with the NICE funding guidance being ignored and many patients having to pay for their own treatment.' However he said the report also shows the continued coordinated efforts of professionals to reduce the number of multiple births. 'While twins and triplets may seem like an instant family, health outcomes for children are better if they are born 'one at a time',' he explained.","In 2013, 49,636 women had a total of 64,600 cycles of IVF in the UK .

"An 82-year-old woman who repeatedly stabbed her husband of 36 years in the back with her sewing scissors because she wrongly believed he was having an affair, has been jailed for four-and-a-half years. Elizabeth Stokes, of Cheltenham, Gloucestershire, 'ambushed' her husband John, 69, in the middle of the night, stabbing him 13 times and puncturing both of his lungs. He staggered to the bathroom, bleeding profusely, and she followed before telling him he had no means of escape because she had hidden his keys and phone, a court heard. Elizabeth Stokes, 82, (pictured right in the purple coat outside Gloucester Crown Court) 'ambushed' her husband John, 69 (left), in the middle of the night, stabbing him 13 times and puncturing both of his lungs . Mr Stokes only managed to get help after shouting loudly out of the bathroom window to alert a neighbour, who called 999. After a four day trial at Gloucester Crown Court, a jury today convicted Stokes of wounding her husband with intent to cause him grievous bodily harm. However, she was cleared of a charge of attempted murder. She had denied both charges. Jailing her, Judge Jamie Tabor QC said she remained 'fixated' with the idea that her husband had been unfaithful and she would therefore still be a danger to him when she leaves prison. He made an indefinite restraining order banning her from contacting her husband in any way. Stokes had told the jury that she believed her husband had two affairs during their marriage and was still seeing another woman at the time of the attack on July 27. He had been getting Viagra from the doctor and she believed he had a second phone to speak to his mistress, she said. She claimed she suddenly 'snapped' on the day of the attack and grabbed the scissors to stab him as he returned to bed from the bathroom. However, Judge Tabor said it was a 'deliberate and planned ambushing' and that she had put her sewing scissors in the bedroom in readiness for the attack. Mr Stokes, who spent eight days in hospital and made a full recovery, told prosecutors before the trial that he did not want to see her jailed and would go back to her. Mrs Stokes, who has short grey hair and wore a blue patterned woollen cardigan and grey trousers, sat in the dock and listened intently with a hearing loop as Judge Tabor passed sentence. Stokes (pictured), of Cheltenham, was jailed for four-and-a-half years at Gloucester Crown Court after being convicted of wounding with intent . He told her: 'On the outside to observers your marriage to Mr Stokes appeared to be peaceful and loving. 'But on the inside - what you called indoors - you were seething with resentment of your husband. 'You had a fixation and almost certainly a delusion that he was being unfaithful to you but your resentment went much further than that. 'You described him as a very good actor who was devious, sly and spiteful. You described him as a Jekyll and Hyde character, very jealous and a complete coward. 'That was not a delusion - that was the way you felt about the man you lived with for 36 years. 'That resentment grew and grew in your mind until the time came when you planned to assault him very seriously indeed. 'You lay in wait for him while he went to the lavatory. You sprang out at him and started to stab him in the back with a pair of scissors which I suspect you had got for the job. 'When he turned around you stabbed him high up on his body causing both lungs to be penetrated. 'Although I am not a doctor I suspect some of those injuries were not far from the heart. 'He could have died but you showed remarkable callousness once you had caused those injuries, leaving him to bleed in the bath and making remarks like 'No-one's going to hear you.' The judge said he had taken her age into account, as well as her previous good character. He also made allowances for fact her son Brian died in an accident last year, and said he had taken into account the effect it had on her. He said: 'This is a quite extraordinary case. It is one of a type which does not come before the courts very often and it of course poses problems for a sentencing judge. 'Your age, your good character, your diminutive size all mean sentencing has to be outside the guidelines for this kind of case.' He said that a defendant of normal age who committed such an offence could expect a 12-year term. Rupert Lowe, defending, had told the judge: 'Mrs Stokes is by far the oldest person in Eastwood Park Prison [where she has been on remand since the offence]. 'She never expected to be there and none of the staff ever expected to see a lady like her. Sentencing Stokes at Gloucester Crown Court (pictured), Judge Jamie Tabor QC described the attack  as a 'deliberate and planned ambushing'. However, the pensioner was cleared of an attempted murder charge . 'She has undoubtedly learned the error of her ways and how serious what she did was. She is not in a position where she would ever do that again in my submission, even in the very unlikely event they were back together.' Judge Tabor said: 'I suspect he would have her back as quick as a flash if indeed he genuinely loves her as he said he did. 'He is obviously a very forgiving man and if he felt she didn't pose a threat - and he would be the worst judge of that - he would have her back.' Mr Lowe submitted that it was 'not the most serious' wounding of its kind but the judge retorted: 'He nearly died. If he had not been able to shout out of the window to get help he might have done.' At the start of the trial, prosecutor Julian Kesner said she had clearly planned to stab her husband because she had taken the scissors to the bedroom and hidden his keys and phone. As she started to stab Mr Stokes, he asked her 'What are you doing this for?' and she replied: 'You have ruined my life because of these affairs.' When Mr Stokes ran to the bathroom and stood in the bath with blood pouring from his wounds she told him: 'You're trapped. The phone's gone. Your keys are gone and you've got no means of escape.' Mr Kesner continued: 'Losing blood, getting weaker, he called out of the bathroom window to the neighbours. Her response was 'No-one's going to hear you. It's the dead of night.' 'He called out again to the closest neighbours 'Raphael, Barbara, help me - I'm bleeding to death.' Police arrived and arrested Mrs Stokes while paramedics attended and took her husband to hospital where he spent eight days being treated. Two of his chest wounds were so deep they had penetrated and punctured both lungs, Mr Kesner said.","Elizabeth Stokes, 82, stabbed husband John 13 times with sewing scissors .

In August 1978 it nearly passed into the hands of the then 27-year-old heiress Christina Onassis, the only daughter of billionaire Greek shipping magnate Aristotle Onassis, who flew into London on her private jet for a one-day tour of houses in Mayfair and Belgravia . One of the homes she viewed was Number 7, however she backed out of buying it because a neighbouring property was being rented by the DeGrimston family - who gossips claimed were cult worshippers. Their house was dubbed 'Satan's Cave' and it is thought this lead to the socialite getting cold feet on the purchase. Scared off: Shipping heir Christina Onassis nearly bought the property, but was reportedly put off by 'devil-worshippers' next door . The Arts & Craft property, built in 1891, has been snapped up by a wealthy millionaire and could now be turned into one of London's newest super-homes. Spread over 13,000sq/ft, the property is around 15 times the size of the average newbuild in the UK. The property was marketed by Wetherell and Savills estate agents, with the deal confirmed by Peter Wetherell. Due to a confidentiality agreement, Mr Wetherell would not confirm the final price paid or who had bought it. However, if it is anywhere near the £45 million asking price, it will be among the biggest sales of 2014. If the deal went through before the recent stamp duty change, the buyer would pay £3.15 million in tax on a £45 million pad. However, if it was signed off after the deadline they will have to pay a staggering £5.3 million in stamp duty. The most expensive publicly listed deal of 2014 was £50 million for a flat in Knightsbridge. Mr Wetherell said: 'No.7 Balfour Place is one of the most magnificent Arts & Craft mansions in London. 'Built as a trophy property within the historic Grosvenor Estate it benefits from a prestigious Mayfair address, elegant architecture and rooms with princely proportions. 'As apartments it could be used as an investment to generate rental income, reinstated into a single residence, it could create one of London's finest mega-mansions, an outstanding home of world class quality and refined provenance.' The property was designed by Eustace Balfour and has a five storey brick facade. It originally featured large entertaining rooms and eight family bedrooms while the fourth and fifth floors were for staff. Over the years it has had a number owners including several industrialists, a Dowager Countess and a City of London metal-trader magnate. Soaring: Property prices are on the rise in Mayfair with homes changing hands for £4,000 and £5,000 sq/ft . In August 1978 the then 27-year-old shipping heiress Christina Onassis viewed the property, but was reportedly put off because a neighbouring property was being rented by the DeGrimston family - who gossips claimed were cult worshippers .

Number 7 was converted into six apartments in 1991 and the deal could prove to be a shrewd purchase. Property prices are on the rise in Mayfair with homes changing hands for £4,000 and £5,000 sq/ft. This could give 7 Balfour Place a potential value of between £52 and £65 million. Some industry experts estimate values could hit £10,000 sq/ft in a decade - making it a £130 million home.","The Mayfair mansion boasts 19 bedrooms, seven reception rooms, six kitchens, 17 bathrooms and a roof terrace .

"These pictures show the appalling living conditions a group of eastern European slaves were forced to endure before being rescued by police. Officers saved 13 Slovakian 'slaves' during a raid at a picture framing factory in Rochdale. They have alleged they were working in terrible conditions and were paid £25 for an 80-hour week after deductions for rent and travel. The home they lived in is bare, filthy and some of them were forced to sleep on a mattress on the floor. Filthy: The Rochdale house where the 13 Slovakian slaves lived. They were paid £25 for an 80-hour week after rent was deducted for the squalid home and travel . One officer said: 'The men and women were effectively working for pennies, while simultaneously ensuring they remain reliant on the people enslaving them'. Pictured, a mattress on the floor in their spartan home . Grim: Washing dries in a bare, filthy room in the Rochdale house the workers were forced to live in . The 'slaves', all adults, were found during a police raid working in a unit on a business park and had been subject to 'physical and verbal abuse', say police. Four men, aged, 34 51, 43 and 40, were arrested on suspicion of conspiracy to require another person to perform forced or compulsory labour and conspiracy to commit trafficking offences. The raid follows the previous discovery of 10 other eastern European 'slaves' at a house in Rochdale, where the workers were being kept four to a room. It is the latest phase of Operation Retriever, designed to tackle human trafficking in Rochdale. Its first strike last month ended with five people being charged over their alleged involvement in a trafficking ring which is said to have sold a pregnant woman into a sham marriage and then attempted to trick her into aborting her baby. More pictures showing the squalid conditions. The raid follows the previous discovery of 10 other eastern European 'slaves' at a house in Rochdale, where the workers were being kept four to a room . Commenting on the latest raid, Det Insp James Faulkner said: 'This is another excellent result from a joint operation which has strived to uncover and protect vulnerable victims from the men and women hoping to exploit them for their own financial gain. 'The men and women working in the factory have told us that they were subjected to physical and verbal assaults at the hands of their employers and forced to work more than 80 hours before ending up with around £25 for their week's work. 'This is a typical example of how modern slavery can work in the UK. 'The men and women are promised accommodation and jobs, but are forced to live in cramped, terrible conditions before being taken to work in a factory for more than 12 hours each day.' The 13 'slaves', all adults, were found during a police raid working in a unit on a business park. Four men, aged 35, 51, 43 and 40, were arrested on suspicion of conspiracy to require another person to perform forced or compulsory labour and conspiracy to commit trafficking offences . He added: 'At the end of the week, the factory owners pay them around £125 for their 80 hours, but then take up to £100 away immediately for rent, travel and other expenses. 'This leaves the men and women effectively working for pennies, while simultaneously ensuring they remain reliant on the people enslaving them. 'When you consider that this factory was producing frames and pictures for major high street companies, with contracts running into the millions of pounds, it proves just how much money these men stood to make from this exploitation. 'Now GMP and our partners in Rochdale council will be striving to safeguard these victims from further exploitation, and we will do our utmost to ensure that the people responsible for this injustice are punished to the full extent of the law.' Mark Widdup, director of economy and environment with Rochdale council, said: 'Today's raid is another example of agencies working together to share, connect and act on information, quickly and effectively. 'Through truly groundbreaking initiatives like PET, the Partnership Enforcement Team, we use all our tools and powers, be it through housing, revenues and benefits or trading standards to disrupt criminality in the borough. 'We want to send a clear message that Rochdale council and the police are committed to rooting out criminal behaviour, bringing the perpetrators to justice and helping victims.'","The 13 slaves, all adults, endured physical and verbal abuse, police claim .

"The brother of a British man and his family who were massacred in the French Alps has accused police of being 'racist' and 'incompetent'. Zaid al-Hilli claims that French police bungled the murder investigation after they missed evidence and failed to properly secure the crime scene. His brother Saad, 50, from Claygate, Surrey, was shot alongside his wife Ikbal, 47 and mother-in-law Suhaila al-Allaf, 74, on a remote road near Annecy in September 2012. French cyclist Sylvain Mollier was also killed in the attack. Zaid al-Hilli (left) claims that French police bungled the investigation into the murder of his brother Saad (right) after they missed evidence and failed to properly secure the crime scene . The murder scene in the forest near Chevaline and Lake Annecy in the French Alps where  Saad al-Hilli, 50, was shot dead in September 2012 alongside his wife Ikbal, 47, and her mother, Suhaila al-Allaf, 74 . Mr al-Hilli was arrested on suspicion of Saad's murder in June last year. But by January this year, he was told police did not have enough evidence and the charges were dropped. The businessman, who lives in Chessington, claims he has been the target of a witch-hunt by the French authorities who had spread 'lies' about him and his family. 'Our background is Middle Eastern and I think they set out to protect the white French families', he told the BBC News. French authorities and Surrey Police have refused to comment. Mr al-Hilli became the prime suspect in the French police's investigation after he revealed he almost came to blows with his brother as they discussed splitting their father's estate in 2011. But while he admitted there had been a disagreement over their inheritance, he had loved his family. 'I love my brother, I love his family, I love my nieces, I would never harm them,' he said, adding that police had now established 'that there is nothing to link our family with the crime'. More than 100 police officers in France and the UK have been involved in investigating the case and about 800 people have been interviewed. But Mr al-Hilli has called for a public inquiry into the case as he believes the police have missed vital evidence after officers reported they had found a passport in Saad's jacket in July- a year-and-a-half after the investigation was launched. Mr al-Hilli also said police allowed the crime scene to become 'trashed' by emergency service vehicles. French police blocked the road to the murder scene at La Combe d'Ire in Chevaline, but Mr al-Hilli claims officials allowed the area to become 'trashed' Saad Al-Hilli with one of his daughters before the tragedy took place . French police released a drawing of a motorcyclist they wanted in connection with the 2012 murders . Saad al-Hilli, 50, was shot dead in September 2012 alongside his wife Ikbal, 47, and her mother, Suhaila al-Allaf, 74, in an execution-style attack on a remote road in the Alps near where they had been camping. The body of French cyclist Sylvain Mollier was also found nearby in a forest layby near Lake Annecy in eastern France on September 5. Each had been shot three times, all at least once in the head. The couple's daughter eldest Zainab was shot in the shoulder and beaten, but survived. Her four-year-old sister Zeena lay hidden under her mother's body and was only discovered eight hours after the murders. Neither of them now talk about the attack. Saad's brother Zaid became the French police's prime suspect in October 2013 after he admitted they argued over their £1million inheritance. Zaid al-Hilli, 54, an accountant from Chessington, Surrey, revealed he and his brother almost came to blows as they discussed splitting their father's estate in 2011. He was arrested in July on suspicion of masterminding the killings, hiring a hitman to take out his brother, but denied all charges. Up to 100 officers in Britain and France were focused on several lines of inquiry linked to the family's complex background – they moved from Baghdad to Britain in 1971 - and the large family inheritance. The businessman  was then cleared by British police of any involvement in January 2014 after being told by Surrey Police there was not enough evidence to charge him. But hours later French investigators said they were considering applying for an international arrest warrant for the 54-year-old, as they still consider him a prime suspect. The case against him was later dropped. In February this year, French police arrested former policeman Eric Devouassoux who was found with a stash of World War Two weapons and other munitions at his home. The arrest came after police released an artist's impression of a male motorcyclist wanted in connection with the murders . He too was later cleared of any involvement. Zaid al Hilli has always maintained that cyclist Mollier was the real target of the attack and claimed that police were covering up for him.","Zaid al-Hilli says police bungled investigation into brother Saad's death .

"A high-risk sex offender accused of raping and murdering five women went unmonitored during his killing spree because his GPS bracelet had been removed. According to court documents, Steven Gordon, 45, went unmonitored for two weeks because he was allowed to take the tracker off. During this time he allegedly lured the prostitutes off the street in Orange County, California, and disposed of their bodies in bins in Anaheim. Confession: Steven Dean Gordon, left, has admitted to killing four California prostitutes and another woman who has never been identified, along with his co-defendant Frank Cano, right . Gordon, who is facing the charges alongside accomplice Frank Cano, was allowed to take off the GPS when he finished his parole in November 2013, according to the LA Times. Just a few days later a judge discovered that he was homeless, and ordered that the tag be put back on. However it took two weeks for the U.S. Probabtion and Pre-trial System to replace it. During that time one of his alleged victims disappeared in that time and was presumably killed. Prosecutors say they doubt that this delay prevented the woman's death because both Gordon and Cano were wearing trackers at the time of the alleged attacks. The Times have also revealed that the pair had a history of cutting off their bracelets and fleeing the state. Both defendants have pleaded not guilty. When Gordon was arrested, he told Anaheim police Detective Julissa Trapp that he had not been wearing the anklet for a period of time told the grand jury. The transcript contains little new information about the 28-year-old Cano. Trapp reported that Gordon first said Cano didn't know of Gordon's plans to strangle the women. But by the end of the interview, Gordon said Cano had strangled each woman while Gordon punched them in the stomach to 'get the air out faster.' The women were then stripped of their clothes, washed and placed in a Dumpster. The body of the final woman killed, 21-year-old Jarrae Nykkole Estepp of Oklahoma, was found on a conveyor belt at a trash-recycling plant in Anaheim but the bodies of the other three have never been found. Victims: Jarrae Nykkole Estepp, 21, from Oklahoma, left, whose body was found on a conveyor belt at a recycling centre in Anaheim prompted the initial investigation which led to the other cases including Martha Anaya, 28, right . Slain: Josephine Monique Vargas, left, and Kianna Jackson, 20, right, were also raped and murdered . The fifth woman, referenced by Gordon in the interview, has not been identified and the two are not charged in her death. The two were arrested on April 11 after Estepp's body was found the month before. Police believe Cano and Gordon have known each other since at least 2010, when Cano cut off his GPS device and fled to Alabama, where he was arrested with Gordon. Two years later, in 2012, they again snipped off their monitoring devices and boarded a Greyhound bus to Las Vegas using fake names.  The men were arrested by federal agents on May 8, 2012, after a two-week stay at Circus Circus Hotel & Casino, according to federal court documents. Gordon traveled using the alias Dexter McCoy and Cano chose Joseph Madrid, authorities said. Cano and Gordon were previously ordered to register as sex offenders after being convicted in separate cases of lewd and lascivious acts with a child under 14. Gordon was convicted in 1992 and also has a 2002 kidnapping conviction, while Cano's conviction dates back to 2008. Crime scene: Estepp's body was recovered from Anaheim's Republic Waste Services in March . The first woman to disappear was Kianna Jackson, 20, of Las Vegas, who arrived in Santa Ana in October 2013 for a court hearing on misdemeanor charges of prostitution and loitering to commit prostitution. Her mother said she stopped responding to her text messages soon after she arrived. Josephine Monique Vargas, 34, was last seen October 24, 2013, after leaving a family birthday party to go to a store. Martha Anaya, 28, asked her boyfriend to pick up their 5-year-old daughter so she could work on November 12, 2013, but then stopped responding to his messages later that night. Police said she also had a history of prostitution. Estepp's mother, Jodi Michelle Pier-Estepp, said her daughter had a troubled past but was working to turn her life around when she traveled to California to visit her brother and stopped in Orange County along the way. When they were arrested, Cano and Gordon had been living in a car and on the streets. Gordon had a job cleaning cars at an auto body shop in Anaheim.","Steven Dean Gordon, 45, told police he and Frank Cano, 28, killed four women, one of whom has not been identified .

"English MPs will refuse to back further devolution to Scotland unless their ‘second class’ status is addressed by a system of ‘English votes for English laws’, a Tory grandee warned yesterday. Lord Heseltine predicted a revolt against giving Holyrood the right to determine tax and welfare policy unless Scottish MPs are barred from voting on such issues only affecting the rest of the UK. ‘Let’s be frank about it: English MPs are not going to implement that [Scottish devolution] unless they get a degree of equality for England,’ said the former deputy prime minister. Decision time: MPs crowd into the Commons for a crucial vote. English MPs will refuse to back further devolution to Scotland without a system of ‘English votes for English laws’, a Tory grandee warned yesterday . Yesterday Commons Leader William Hague incurred Labour’s fury by setting out options for how to give English MPs the final say over laws affecting only England. Senior ministers are understood to believe that this must include rates of income tax and benefit payments, a reform which would make it difficult for a future Labour government to pass Budgets. It would also raise questions over whether a Scottish MP could ever again be Prime Minister or Chancellor, given that they would not be able to vote on key areas of Government policy. Mr Hague told MPs: ‘The injustice for the voters of England is now sufficiently great to be considered more than an anomaly. ‘When it comes to deciding who votes on matters in other parts of the United Kingdom, it is English MPs who feel that they are second class. That is why we must deal with the issue. Otherwise, it will damage this Parliament and the United Kingdom.’ Lord Heseltine predicted a revolt against giving Holyrood the right to determine tax and welfare policy unless Scottish MPs are barred from voting on such issues only affecting the rest of the UK . Labour has long relied on the support of its power base of Scottish MPs to pass legislation in Westminster. But since the creation of the Scottish Parliament, critics have questioned how it can be right for Scots MPs to determine issues such as tuition fees and foundation hospitals which no longer affect their constituents. Decisions on health and education policies have already been devolved to Holyrood. After Scotland’s rejection of independence in September, the main parties signed up to a ‘vow’ to hand the Scottish Parliament yet more power. This included control of income tax and welfare payments. Mr Hague said the scale of devolution meant the question of the status of Scottish MPs at Westminster was unavoidable. ‘It is an issue that too many people have avoided for too long and that can no longer be put aside,’ he insisted. Mr Hague published three options: an outright ban on Scottish MPs from having any role on English and Welsh Bills; giving English MPs a ‘decisive’ role by allowing only them to amend English-only laws; or giving English MPs a veto over such laws. The Tory leadership is understood to favour the last option. A Government paper has suggested the principle of a veto ‘could be applied to levels of tax and benefits where the equivalent rates have been devolved to Scotland or elsewhere’. The Lib Dems back the idea of a veto to be decided by a committee of MPs. They want it to be appointed by the share of the vote for each party at the last election rather than the make-up of the Commons. Currently, that would significantly favour the Lib Dems. Mr Hague confirmed he wanted to press the issue to a vote in the New Year although the Liberal Democrats could thwart this. Shadow justice secretary Sadiq Khan agreed English MPs needed a greater say over English laws but said any decisions should not be rushed before the election. Later Mr Hague admitted disputes among the parties meant it was unlikely the subject would be settled before May’s poll. Lord Heseltine also told the BBC’s Daily Politics show Labour was in ‘deep trouble’ on the issue and ‘coming up with every explanation as to why it should be kicked into the long grass’. What are the options? Analysis by JAMES CHAPMAN, political editor . William Hague yesterday set out the options which could change the way Britain is governed for ever . William Hague yesterday set out the options which could change the way Britain is governed for ever . BAN SCOTTISH MPs VOTING . The most hardline option. It would mean Scottish MPs being barred from voting at any stage of legislation deemed by the Commons Speaker to apply only to England or England and Wales. Such legislation would be considered throughout by a so-called grand committee of English MPs or, where appropriate, English and Welsh MPs. ‘DECISIVE SAY’ FOR ENGLISH MPs . Bills deemed to apply only to England, or England and Wales, would be considered and voted on as normal by all Westminster MPs at their second reading – the first full debate and vote on any legislation. But the committee stage, where a Bill is considered line by line by a small group of MPs for revision or amendment, would only involve English (or English and Welsh) MPs, appointed depending on their party representation in the Commons. Only English MPs would vote at the report stage, when the committee reports back to the whole House on its changes. At third reading – the final hurdle that has to be cleared by legislation and no further changes are allowed – all MPs, including Scots, would be allowed to vote. The Commons as a whole would have to either accept changes agreed by English MPs or reject the entire Bill. AN ENGLISH VETO . A formal veto for English MPs over laws only applying in their constituencies. This appears to be the preferred Conservative option. Again, second reading would proceed as normal, involving all MPs. The committee stage would involve only English MPs appointed on the basis of their respective parties’ strengths in the Commons. The report stage would involve all MPs, including from Scotland. But then crucially, English-only legislation would have to clear a new Parliamentary hurdle prior to a third reading. It would need to win a ‘consent motion’ based on the votes of only English or English and Welsh MPs who would make up the grand committee. They could grant their consent or veto a Bill or part of a Bill. This would include issues like income tax or benefit rates, once these are devolved to Holyrood. AND WHAT THE LIB DEMS WANT . The Lib Dems back the Conservatives on the principle of an ‘English veto’.

"A webcam captured the incredible moment a rare African penguin chick hatched out of its shell, with the birth of its sibling set to follow. The baby bird, born at the National Aviary in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, on Monday, is apparently around the same size as a golf ball. It is currently being nuzzled by its two busy parents, Sidney and Bette, who are taking it in turns to tend the nest. Scroll down for video . Caught on camera: A webcam allowed viewers to watch the live birth of a rare African penguin on Monday - here one of the chick's parents can be seen . The fluffy chick cracked out of an egg laid on November 9 and a second egg, laid two days later, is expected to hatch this week. The father, Sidney, is named for Sidney Crosby, the star of Pittsburgh's National Hockey League team, the Penguins. It is the third set of chicks he has welcomed with his mate Bette. Their newborns will be named after DNA tests can determine their gender in a few weeks' time. After this point, they will be moved from the nest to an indoor enclosure to be hand-reared by National Aviary staff. Hidden from view: The baby bird is apparently around the size of a golf ball - it will be joined by a sibling this week if all goes well . This special upbringing will ensure they are ready to fulfill their future roles as ambassadors for their species in the park's educational and interactive programs. Monday's birth at the National Aviary brings to 17 the number of endangered African penguins in the aviary's Penguins Point exhibit. Scientists estimate fewer than 20,000 of the birds exist in the wild, making them critically endangered.

"The ex-girlfriend of Kurt Busch sobbed in court today as she described how the NASCAR champion allegedly smashed her head into a wall three times in September. Patricia Driscoll, 36, is asking a judge in Dover, Delaware, to grant a protection order against Busch, saying that she fears for her safety. She says Busch 'snapped' and attacked her on September 26 after hurling insults at her in their motorhome at Dover International Speedway because he was furious about his performance in a race.

Driscoll did not call police to report the alleged attack until November 8 - six weeks later. Detectives in Dover have interviewed both Driscoll and Busch - though they have not made any arrests and are still investigating the case. In court on Tuesday, Driscoll began to sob as she recounted the alleged assault, according to the Delaware News-Journal. 'It scared me because he just snapped,' she said through tears. Busch has emphatically denied Driscoll's allegations and said she is trying to exact revenge against him after he ended their relationship. The elegant blonde sobbed in court as she described the alleged attack and also asked that Busch undergo psychological evaluation . 'He expects to be vindicated when the entire truth of the situation comes to light. This allegation is a complete fabrication by a woman who has refused to accept the end of a relationship and Mr Busch vehemently denies her allegations in every respect,' a PR representative for Busch told the newspaper last month. Busch is also expected to testify at the hearing on Tuesday. Driscoll - the head of a not profit agency that helped wounded soldiers - has filed court documents asking that a judge order Busch to stay away from her and not contact her. She also is asking that Busch undergo a psychiatric evaluation and be evaluated by a certified domestic violence treatment agency.","Patricia Driscoll broke down as she described the alleged September 26 attack by Kurt Busch .

"A Northern California police department put one of its officers on leave Monday and is investigating threatening comments from his Twitter account about demonstrators who have participated in protests over the recent deaths of unarmed black men in Ferguson, Missouri and New York. The San Jose Police Department said Officer Phillip White was sidelined after officials learned of statements made Saturday from his Twitter account. In the tweets, White said he would kill anyone who threatens him or his family. He also said he would be off-duty at the movies with his gun if anyone 'feels they can't breathe or their lives matter.'

He also said he would be off-duty at the movies with his gun if anyone 'feels they can't breathe or their lives matter.' The tweets and hashtag played on protest slogans 'I can't breathe' and 'black lives matter.' Efforts to reach White through the San Jose Police Officer's Association were not successful. The tweets and White's Twitter account have been deleted amid a social media firestorm over the comments. White's department, union and a college where he coached basketball all condemned the comments. 'It is extremely important for the community to know the comments made on Officer White's private social media account do not reflect the thoughts or feelings of the men and women here at the San Jose Police Department,' San Jose Police Chief Larry Esquivel said.

"Flat screen tvs, playgrounds and 24-hour snacks are a few of the facilities on offer inside the nation's largest family detention center which is about to open in Texas. On Monday Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson visited the 50-acre compound featuring 80 tan, two-bedroom, one-bathroom cottages connected by dirt roads and newly laid grass sod in Dilley, about 70 miles southwest of San Antonio. The cottages include bunk beds and cribs that can sleep up to eight, and a kitchen - although cooking is prohibited to prevent fires.

The cafeteria is open 12 hours daily and snacks can be had around the clock. There's medical care and counselors, trailer classrooms, library and email access and a basketball court and playgrounds - all meant to showcase the softer side of immigration detention. A library will have books with work by poet Victor Hugo and philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche, reports Express News. The first wave of about 30 immigrants will begin arriving in coming weeks and the cabins will eventually hold up to 480 people. Housing being constructed nearby will push capacity to 2,400 by around May. Federal authorities are preparing for the possibility that mothers and children may again come pouring across the U.S.-Mexico border illegally. Advocates say immigrant families are often fleeing drug or gang violence in Central America and should be released to relatives already in the U.S., rather than being locked up. The daily cost of family detention is about $296 per person, according to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, nearly double the average cost of holding adults as estimated by the National Immigration Forum advocacy group. Women and children at Dilley will remain until they are deported, released on bond or begin immigration court proceedings that could allow them to stay in the United States. ICE says 70 percent of immigrant families released into the U.S. never showed up for follow-up appointments — part of the reason the agency is adding detention capacity. Like a small village: The cottages include bunk beds and cribs that can sleep up to eight, and a kitchen - although cooking is prohibited to prevent fires . New homes: On Monday Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson visited the 50-acre compound featuring 80 tan, two-bedroom, one-bathroom cottages connected by dirt roads and newly laid grass sod in Dilley, about 70 miles southwest of San Antonio . U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson addresses reporters after touring a new family immigration detention center in Dilley, Texas, on Monday.  Opening following a summer surge of children crossing the U.S.-Mexico border illegally, the compound will have an initial capacity of 480 . Yet Johnson stressed that despite President Barack Obama's recently announced executive actions on immigration, anyone who crossed illegally into the U.S. this year remains a priority for deportation. 'This must be clear: Our borders are not open to illegal migration,' he said. Dilley opens as officials are closing a temporary family immigration detention center that, at its height, held about 700 people on the grounds of a law enforcement training center in Artesia, New Mexico. It opened in June, at the height of a crush of families at the border, while Dilley begins during a lull. But Royce Bernstein Murray, director of policy for the National Immigrant Justice Center, said patterns are seasonal and advocates and federal officials alike expect crossings to increase again in the spring. Once Dilley is fully operational, federal authorities will be able to house about 3,000 immigrant women and children nationwide. Collectively that's still a drop in the bucket because nearly everyone apprehended at the border faces deportation. But Johnson said Central Americans no longer believe lies spread earlier this year by smugglers that anyone making it to the U.S. can stay. 'We know from the interviews conducted with migrants, many of them did not expect to be detained once they cross the border,' Johnson said. Bernstein Murray countered: 'If people are fleeing violence, they don't have the luxury of saying, 'I'm going to end up in detention? Then, no, I'm not coming.''","50-acre compound is in Dilley, about 70 miles southwest of San Antonio .

"A federal appeals court today overturned a controversial ruling ordering Massachusetts prison officials to provide taxpayer-funded sex-reassignment surgery for an inmate convicted of murder. Michelle Kosilek, born Robert Kosilek, has already received hormone treatments, psychotherapy and electrolysis while serving a life sentence for strangling to death her wife, Cheryl, in 1990. But she has continued to wage a protracted legal battle for the $20,000 full genital reconstruction treatment she says is necessary to relieve the mental anguish caused by gender-identity disorder. While imprisoned, she has tried to commit suicide twice, as well as attempting to castrate herself. Scroll down for video . Convicted murderer: A federal appeals court has overturned a ruling ordering Massachusetts prison officials to provide taxpayer-funded sex-reassignment surgery for convicted murderer Michelle Kosilek (pictured) In 2012, U.S. District Judge Mark Wolf judge became the first judge in the country to order sex-reassignment surgery as a remedy for an inmate's gender-identity disorder. Although most American courts agree that prisons must evaluate transgender inmates to determine their medical needs, most have ordered only hormone treatments and psychotherapy, not surgery. In January, Wolf's decision was upheld by a three-judge panel of the 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. However, prison officials appealed and won a rehearing before the full appeals court. Now, in a 3-2 ruling, the full 1st Circuit found that Kosilek failed to demonstrate officials violated the Eight Amendment prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment by not providing the surgery. The court noted that the state's Department of Correction has already provided treatment for 65-year-old Kosilek's gender-identity disorder, including the female hormones and laser hair removal. The court also acknowledged the department's concerns about protecting Kosilek from sexual assaults if she completes her gender transition. Arrest: Kosilek (pictured following her arraignment as Robert Kosilek) has already received hormone treatments, psychotherapy and electrolysis while serving a life sentence for strangling to death her wife . VIctim: The convict fatally strangled her wife, Cheryl Kosilek (pictured),  with a wire and a rope in 1990 . She is currently housed in a male prison but hoped to be transferred to a female prison after the surgery. 'After carefully considering the community standard of medical care, the adequacy of the provided treatment, and the valid security concerns articulated by the DOC, we conclude that the district court erred and that the care provided to Kosilek by the DOC does not violate the Eighth Amendment,' Judge Juan Torruella wrote for the majority. However, two judges disagreed with the verdict. In a sharply worded dissenting opinion, Judge Ojetta Rogeriee Thompson suggested that Kosilek would not have had to fight a long battle for constitutionally adequate medical care if she was not seeking 'a treatment that many see as strange or immoral'. Legal action: In 2011, Kosilek (pictured in his police mugshot) said the surgery is a medical necessity . 'Prejudice and fear of the unfamiliar have undoubtedly played a role in this matter's protraction,' Thompson wrote. The Department of Correction declined to comment immediately. The case sparked a heated debate in Massachusetts, where Kosilek's lawsuit became fodder for radio talk shows and state lawmakers who say the state should not be forced to pay for or provide a murderer's sex-reassignment surgery. In his ruling ordering the surgery, U.S. District Court Judge Mark Wolf found that it is the 'only adequate treatment' for Kosilek. In 2011, the inmate told The Associated Press  that the surgery is a medical necessity. 'Everybody has the right to have their health care needs met, whether they are in prison or out on the streets,' Kosilek said. 'People in the prisons who have bad hearts, hips or knees have surgery to repair those things. My medical needs are no less important or more important than the person in the cell next to me.' Kosilek's lawyer, Joseph Sulman, said he was disappointed in the ruling, but declined further comment because he had not yet read the full 117-page ruling. Jennifer Levi, director of the Transgender Rights Project of the Boston-based legal group Gay & Lesbian Advocates & Defenders, said she was appalled by the ruling. 'If somebody had a heart condition, if somebody had liver disease, if somebody had diabetes ... under the constitutional principles applied to all people who are incarcerated, that person would be entitled to essential medical care,' Levi said. 'It really is hard to understand this decision as anything other than transgender exceptionalism.'","Michelle Kosilek, born Robert, jailed for life  for murdering wife in 1990 .

"There's nothing like some healthy competition to help two friendly rivals become the stand out achievers in this year's Higher School Certificate. Sydney students Grant Kynaston and Janek Drevikovsky, who share a love for ancient languages, first met when they entered a Latin and Greek poetry reading competition two years ago. Since then, they've battled it out to one of life's defining moments - the HSC - and between them, they topped the state in nine subjects by studying an average of three to four hours each day. But despite their high achieving results, the duo appeared to be stumped when asked to names all the Kardashian sisters on Nine Network's Today show this morning. Scroll down for video .

When the boys were asked to list the five Kardashian sisters, Grant was able to identify  Kim (middle), Khloe (left) and Kourtney (right) While the two rivals weren't shy in admitting their passion for ancient Latin and classical Greek, they were quick to acknowledge their defeat when it came to pop culture. Today co-host Lisa Wilkinson asked the boys to list the five Kardashian sister, to which Grant was able to identify Kim, Kourtney and Khloe but was unable to name Kendall and Kylie. Janek fell silent and readily handed the limelight over to Grant. 'I only really know one Kardashian,' Janek told Daily Mail Australia. 'Honestly, pop culture isn't my strongest point. 'If there was a HSC subject on pop culture I wouldn't have performed very well.' While the two rivals weren't shy in admitting their passion for ancient Latin and classical Greek, they were quick to acknowledge their defeat when it came to pop culture . When asked to list the five Kardashian sister by Today co-host Lisa Wilkinson, the boys appeared to be stumped by the question . Having competed against each other since year 10 at the Latin and Greek Reading Competition, run by the Classical Association of NSW, both students say it's rare to find someone of the same age who share similar interests. Suffice to say, Grant and Janek weren't surprised to cross paths yet again at this year's HSC First in Course ceremony  yesterday and were quite happy to share their success. Grant, of Sydney Grammar, came first in four subjects: Classical Greek continuers and extension, modern history and Latin extension. Janek, of Fort Street High School, came first place in five courses: German continuers and extension, English extension 1 and extension 2 and Latin continuers. While the pair have a history of excellent report cards, neither of them expected to perform as well as they did in their HSC. 'It's really overwhelming in many ways,' Janek said. 'I won't say there wasn't any hard work involved but I certainly didn't overexert myself. 'I do feel a little greedy for taking out first place in five subjects though.' The 18-year-old says he realised his talent for languages at the age of nine. 'My grandmother taught me German from a young age and that really sparked my passion for it all,' Janek said.

'I remember I was in Hobart [Tasmania] when I got a call telling me that I came first in four subjects,' he told Daily Mail Australia. 'I just couldn't believe it and all I could say was ""oh my God, that's amazing"".' The studious pair attribute their achievements to 'consistency'. 'It's all about effective preparation and getting the balance right with your level of study instead of cramming it all at the last minute,' Grant said. Janek agrees and like his competitor, he studied an average of three to four hours each day.

"Schools are struggling to cope with an influx of Roma children from Eastern Europe who arrive unable to speak English, Ofsted warned yesterday. Inspectors said schools were hampered by a lack of resources to meet the ‘wide-ranging needs’ of new arrivals who may never have experienced formal education. They said some pupils were unfamiliar with school routines and behaviour expectations. Many also needed intensive help to learn English but schools were struggling to find enough bilingual staff to teach them. Children playing in a Roma settlement in Bulgaria. Ofsted said they when children arrive in the UK from Eastern Europe language can be a major barrier to learning in schools . In some cases, Roma parents were unaware of what they were expected to do for their children and had to be taken food shopping by teachers to help them fill lunchboxes. Ofsted warned that school budgets were being put under strain by the cost of extra provision. At one school in Derby, the number of Roma pupils rose from four to 99 – almost a third of its roll – in three years. The watchdog urged the Government to ensure that funding for schools was more responsive to fluctuations in the pupil population. However, inspectors found no negative effect on the achievement of other pupils. The report follows visits to 11 schools in Manchester, Sheffield and Derby – where there have been large increases in the number of Roma pupils from Eastern Europe after border controls were relaxed. Ofsted, led by chief inspector Sir Michael Wilshaw, called for more support for schools in areas with a large Roma population . In Sheffield, numbers rose from 100 to 2,100 in five years. Derby’s Roma pupil population tripled to 600 between 2009 and 2013. Manchester has an estimated 800 Roma pupils. Nationally, the number of gipsy and Roma pupils in schools has risen 14 per cent in a year to 19,000. In a report entitled Overcoming Barriers, Ofsted said: ‘In the local authorities and schools visited, almost all Roma pupils arriving from Eastern Europe were new to speaking English. ‘Where newly-arrived Roma pupils have had little prior experience of formal education, schools and local authorities reported that initially they had difficulty in engaging the pupils to adhere to school routines and meet expectations for good behaviour.’ Inspectors said police were asked to address pupils and parents at one Derby primary after ‘a number of playground fights involving Roma pupils’. ‘They introduced a game to teach all children the rights and wrongs of behaviour,’ it added. Even when Roma pupils were well integrated in schools and made good progress, their achievement in exams was still low due to their ‘exceptionally low starting points’. The report went on to note that some schools felt obliged to meet the costs of lunches, uniforms and trips for Roma pupils despite not receiving funding to do so. It told of one family who failed to send their children to school with money or food for lunch when they started. ‘Staff took the parent shopping to advise them on finding cheap and healthy options for packed lunches,’ said inspectors. The report concluded that the schools and local authorities visited ‘were struggling to find the necessary resources to fully meet Roma pupils’ needs’. A Department for Education spokesman said: ‘The difficult decisions we have taken elsewhere in Government have allowed us to protect the schools budget and ensure that local authorities and head teachers have the resources and flexibility to provide the support needed by their communities.’","Study into schools in three council areas: Derby, Manchester and Sheffield .

"A Pennsylvania teen has been granted a new chance to argue there was insufficient evidence to convict him of killing his father's pregnant fiancee when the boy was 11 years old. The state Supreme Court on Monday sent the matter back to Lawrence County juvenile court to hold a hearing about the evidence used to convict Jordan Brown of the February 2009 shotgun killing of 26-year-old Kenzie Hook and her unborn son at their home near Wampum. One of Brown's attorneys, Lourdes Rosado, said his lawyers will file a motion seeking a new trial, arguing that his prior adjudication of delinquency in juvenile court went against the weight of the evidence. Another chance: Now 17, Jordan Brown (right and left) was 11 when he was arrested for the shooting murder of his father's fiancee and her unborn baby . Killed: Jordan Brown was found guilty of shooting with a shotgun 26-year-old Kenzie Hook (center) in 2009 . She called the high court decision gratifying but noted Brown, now 17, remains incarcerated. She said he has always maintained his innocence. 'It is a concern that we're going to be remanded and have to start this process all over again,' Rosado said. 'Time is of an essence when you are a child and sitting in a facility.' Messages seeking comment from the attorney general's office, which is prosecuting the case, were not immediately returned. In the four-justice majority opinion, Justice Debra Todd described some of the evidentiary issues, including whether there was enough evidence to tie Brown to the murder weapon, the possible role of a black truck Brown said he saw by their garage before leaving for school and Brown's healthy relationship with Houk. Cold blooded? Brown (here with his father) has maintained his innocence from the beginning. Prosecutors maintain he used his own youth model shotgun to murder Houk in February 2009 before he went to school with her 7-year-old daughter . Weak case? Brown was arrested less than one day after Houk's death. However, evidence against him is largely circumstantial . Up the judicial ladder: Brown's conviction was overturned in Superior Court, which led to this week's Supreme Court ruling . Brown's father, Todd said, testified that his son and fiancee were 'just as normal as it was between her and her own daughters.' Houk's ex-boyfriend, Todd wrote, denied making threatening phone calls to Houk and said he was not upset by a blood test that showed he was not the father of one of Houk's children. The county judge, Todd said, excluded the ex-boyfriend in part because his hands lacked gunshot residue, he claimed he did not know where Houk lived and because only children's footprints were seen in the snow between the house and the school bus stop. State Superior Court, which reviewed the case last year, said the conviction was 'plainly contrary to the evidence.' Brown is under court supervision until he turns 21; his status is reviewed twice a year. Brown's father, Todd said, testified that his son and fiancee were 'just as normal as it was between her and her own daughters.'","Jordan Brown of Wampum, Pennsylvania--now 17-years-old--was granted on Monday a chance to argue he was unfairly convicted in 2009 .

"Two men have been arrested by counter-terror police today on suspicion of supporting a banned organisation. According to one report, the arrests followed a storm earlier this year over extremists handing out leaflets in London’s Oxford Street which urged Britons to join a new 'Islamic State'. Officers from the Metropolitan Police's Counter Terrorism Command arrested the men, aged 37 and 61, this morning in Luton, Bedfordshire. Arrest: Two men from Luton (pictured) have been held on suspicion of supporting a banned organisation . They were taken to a nearby police station where they were due to be questioned under Schedule 5 of the Terrorism Act 2000, a Scotland Yard spokesman said. There are 63 international terrorist organisations proscribed under the Terrorism Act 2000 including Islamic State (also known as ISIS), Al Qaeda, Al Shabaab, Al Muhajiroun and Boko Haram. Although the vast majority are radical Islamist groups, the Act also proscribes Northern Ireland related groups such as the Irish Republican Army and Ulster Freedom Fighters. According to the Telegraph's security editor Tom Whitehead, today's arrests came after a storm which surrounded leaflets which were handed out in London's busiest shopping street. There was an outcry in August after the leaflets, which were photographed and appeared on Twitter, heralded the 'dawn of a new era' in a newly-created 'Islamic State'. Declaring 'The Khilafah has been re-established', one leaflet claimed 'the Khilafah (Islamic State)' had been destroyed in 1924. Storm: There was anger on social media in August after leaflets praising a new 'Islamic State' were handed out in London's Oxford Street (pictured). A Met Police spokesman declined to confirm the Telegraph's report . It added: 'After many attempts and great sacrifices... the Muslims with the help of Allah have announced the re-establishment of the Khilafah.' The leaflet also called on Muslims to 'migrate and resettle' to the supposed state, 'obey' its leaders and 'expose lies and fabrications' about it, though did not state explicitly where it was. Commons Home Affairs Committee chairman Keith Vaz said at the time he would ask the Metropolitan Police to investigate, adding: 'The public should not be subjected to a terrorist recruitment drive in the middle of Europe’s biggest shopping high street.' Ghaffar Hussain, managing director of the anti-extremism foundation Quilliam, said at the time: 'This is a very disturbing development but one that should not come as a surprise since we are aware that around 500 British nationals have joined up with ISIS already.' However, there was a debate over whether the leaflets broke the law, because the one pictured did not appear to reference any banned groups directly. A Metropolitan Police spokesman declined to confirm or deny the Telegraph's report.","Metropolitan Police arrested men aged 37 and 61 in Luton, Bedfordshire .

"Pressure: Former Labour human rights envoy Ann Clwyd said she felt 'considerable revulsion' More senior Labour figures came forward last night to heap pressure on Ed Miliband, demanding a judge-led inquiry into allegations that Britain was complicit in torture. MPs and peers, including Tony Blair’s former envoy to Iraq, insisted a formal probe led by a judge was needed to get to the truth and ensure public trust in its conclusions. The Labour leader continues to back a probe by Parliament’s Intelligence and Security Committee (ISC), despite it having already cleared the security services of involvement in extraordinary rendition in an earlier probe which was condemned as a whitewash. On Monday several MPs insisted a judge-led investigation was the only way to clear up the questions posed by an explosive US Senate report into torture by the CIA. The report was redacted to remove any mention of MI5, MI6 or Diego Garcia, the British base used by at least two rendition flights. Critics say the ISC does not have the power to uncover the extent of the involvement and knowledge of the security and intelligence agencies and what former Labour ministers including Tony Blair, Jack Straw and David Miliband knew. Ann Clwyd, who was Mr Blair’s human rights envoy to Iraq and now chairs the All Party Parliamentary Group on Human Rights, said she felt ‘considerable revulsion’ at the Senate report’s conclusions. She said: ‘I felt so angry and repelled. This has been rumbling on for some time and we are still none the wiser about Britain’s alleged role. It seems to me the ISC doesn’t have sufficient powers. ‘Somebody in Britain read the report to get the redactions and we need to find out who that was. We need a judge-led inquiry to take evidence on oath and get to the bottom of what’s happened.’ Former Labour minister Lord Dubs, who sat on the Joint Committee on Human Rights when it investigated allegations of UK complicity in torture in 2009, said a judge-led inquiry was ‘almost inevitable’, adding: ‘The ISC is limited in what it can do, what documents it can see or who it can call to give evidence. A judge-led inquiry would be a better way of doing things and gain more public acceptance. Questions: Former Labour MPs do not know what discussions Tony Blair (above) had with the U.S. during the height of the Americans' activities at Guantanamo Bay, which were laid bare in a report last week . ‘On the human rights committee, we investigated this issue and we simply could not pin anything down and did not have the authority to demand answers. ‘In the end, the allegations of complicity in torture are so serious, so appalling, that an inquiry has to be seen to be done properly with no hint of a cover-up, and this can only be done by a judge.’ Shadow Attorney General Lord Bach asked whether the ISC had the ‘capacity and resources’ to investigate, while Labour MP Glenda Jackson said: ‘There should be a judicial inquiry into this. It’s something that I feel the whole country should be assured of and an inquiry is the only way to do that given the mistrust of all parliamentarians.’ Tony Blair could refuse to give evidence to a judge-led inquiry into British complicity in torture. Mr Blair, who was prime minister when the UK territory of Diego Garcia was used for at least two rendition flights, has signalled he would be willing to appear before the Intelligence and Security Committee (ISC). But there are concerns that the ISC, which can allow witnesses to testify in secret, has insufficient powers to get to the truth. His spokesman declined to speculate on whether he would be prepared to face a grilling by a judge-led inquiry, raising the possibility that he would decline to testify in public unless compelled. Mr Blair has been accused of trying to cover up the UK’s involvement in CIA wrongdoing. But a spokesman said: ‘Tony Blair has always been opposed to the use of torture, has always said so publicly and privately, and thinks it is totally unacceptable.’ Labour backbencher Katy Clark said it was ‘vital’ the inquiry into what Britain knew about abuse of detainees was run by a judge. In 2010, David Cameron ordered Sir Peter Gibson to head the Detainee Inquiry to look into the claims that the intelligence services were complicit in torture. But it was suspended after two years while police investigated claims MI6 was involved in the extraordinary rendition of two Libyans. Politicians from all sides and human rights campaigners have insisted the ISC probe, which replaced Gibson, is inadequate. But ministers say it should be allowed to complete the task. On Sunday, Shadow Home Secretary Yvette Cooper said she doubted the ISC had the capacity and the scope to carry out an inquiry and her ‘instinct’ was that a judge-led process was needed. But she stopped short of backing a full judicial investigation. Mr Miliband’s aides said on Monday that the Labour leader agreed with Miss Cooper and had ‘some concerns’ about the ISC ‘but we need to see the way the Government sets that out’. Yesterday a Labour spokesman said the party’s position had not changed, adding: ‘As Yvette said at the weekend, there continues to be a case for an independent inquiry.’","Former human rights envoy Ann Clwyd spoke of 'revulsion' at CIA files .

"Former Radio 1 DJ has been jailed for 13 years for a 20-year campaign of sex attacks on young boys . Former Radio 1 DJ Chris Denning has been jailed for 13 years for sex attacks on 24 boys over two decades. The now-73-year-old - who was one of the founding presenters of the station - used drink, drugs and the 'allure' of his fame to groom his young victims. One of the 40 indecent assaults  was said to have taken place at Jimmy Savile's house. Judge Alistair McCreath told London's Southwark Crown Court the abuse was 'inappropriate and depraved'. He added: 'It is not to be forgotten that all of this suffering was inflicted by you without thought for anything other than your own selfish pleasure.' About a dozen of his victims - one of whom was as young as 10 when the attacks took place - sat at the back of court today, yards from their former tormentor, as the sentence was passed. The prison term means Denning is the longest serving prisoner jailed after being arrested as part of Operation Yewtree, the police investigation set up in the wake of Savile scandal. The court heard Denning, now of Basildon, Essex, took young boys out to watch Top Of The Pops recordings in the 1960s and 1970s. The prolific paedophile began abusing the boys in 1967 - the same year he was unveiled as one of the founding DJs at Radio 1. He moved to Dorset in the 1970s where he opened a computer games shop and used the 'exciting' technology to prey on boys and abuse them. Denning used his print shop in Branksome, Dorset - where he kept a double bed - as a way of meeting youngsters. Neil Moore, prosecuting, told London's Southwark Crown Court: 'The defendant used the allure first of the record industry and celebrity, and then the world of computer games, to entice boys into his company. 'He spoke to them about his career and the celebrities of the moment he knew. He offered them cigarettes, alcohol and drugs, bought them gifts and gave them money. 'He gave them access to pornographic material and gave them the means to do what they wanted in order to groom them. He took them to meals and took them to celebrity parties. Denning (pictured, left, around the time attacks began and, right, in 1997) used a computer shop he opened to attract young boys who he would later attack . Mr Moore added: 'He would introduce them gradually to sexual material by suggesting sexual experimentation is natural. He would then move to sexually abuse them. 'Often a number of boys would be present at his home at the same time. And on a number of occasions he took pictures and videos of the boys. 'He always seemed to satisfy the parents that his motives were good and sound rather than indecent, as they were.' One of his teenage victims told how Denning took him back to his home which was an 'Aladdin's Cave' of pornography. Mr Moore told how Denning's singled out his victims at discos, skateparks and youth centres and plied some with the drug ecstasy.. He boasted of his 'huge record collection' and asked many of the boys back to his house to help catalogue them. Denning - pictured (middle row, second from right) with the original Radio 1 DJs in 1997 - used his fame to groom boys, Southwark Crown Court heard . His victims initially thought Denning was kind and 'charismatic', but soon his 'kindness' would become abuse. Mr Moore said Denning took one boy, aged 12 to 14, to watch Top of the Pops before repeatedly abusing him at his home. He said: 'He described being given alcohol and said initially he found it exciting and mesmerising because the defendant would talk about all the famous people he knew such as Jimmy Savile. 'He would also take them out for meals, concerts and took them to a studio to see filmings of Top of the Pops.' Other victims told how they were taken to celebrity parties where they met Savile and music mogul Jonathan King, who have both since been unmasked as sex offenders. One of his victims was 14 or 15 when he was abused by Denning. He said it happened at Savile's home - although Savile is not said to have been involved. The judge said Denning (pictured) had groomed his victims using alcohol, drugs and the allure of fame . Judge Alistair McCreath told Denning: 'You groomed all of these boys, they were for the most part in their early teens although some of them were younger. 'You used your own fame, your acquaintance with others who were famous, many of them now to be described more as notorious than as famous, your familiarity with the music industry, your possession of computers and computer games and other devices to win their trust and their misplaced admiration. 'You gave them alcohol and drugs. To some of them you gave money. You showed them pornographic material. 'You introduced them to inappropriate sexual behaviour by making it seem normal and exciting. 'In respect of some of them, you won the trust of their parents so that the boys were permitted to spend time, including overnight stays, at your home. You photographed some of them. 'On some occasions the sexual activity took place in the presence of other children. 'The effect on these boys, now men in their middle age has been, as is to be expected, devastating. 'At a critical stage in their development from childhood into adolescence, they were corrupted.'","Former DJ used his showbiz links to impress young boys, court told .

"A 54-year-old man convicted of sexually assaulting an 11-year-old boy in Ohio has been caught working as a Santa Claus at a Texas McDonald's. Norman Burbank was sentenced to 12 years prison for the 1992 rape of the child, but recently moved to Baytown, east of Houston. On Saturday police received an anonymous tip the sex offender was acting as Santa Claus at the fast food restaurant and had children in his lap, according to Click 2 Houston, along with a photo of him taken on a cell phone. However, after being arrested and detained by police, Burbank was let go, after authorities determined he had not violated any laws by putting on the red suit. Detained: Norman Burbank, 54, was taken into custody Saturday at a McDonald's store in Baytown, following an anonymous call. He is seen here in a photo from his Facebook (left) and a police mug shot (right) Snap: A customer at the McDonald's is believed to have taken this picture of Burbank working at the store and sent it to police, who then handcuffed him and took him into custody . Scene: The restaurant released a statement about the incident saying they are investigating . Unless a sex offender is on parole or probation that that stipulates they stay away from children under 17, it isn't against the law to have dealings with children. 'What's right isn't always legal,' legal analyst Brian Wice told the station. 'And what's legal isn't always right.' Local police seemed just as surprised. 'Him putting on a Santa Claus costume and having children in his lap, however unsettling that is for parents to hear, it was not a violation of Texas law,' Eric Freed from the Baytown Police Department told Click 2 Houston. Burbank was approached by the news outlet at his home. He answered the door to the camera crew, but told them he had no comment about his detainment or his job. 'No comment': A local news crew went to Burbank's home in Baytown, but he would not talk about his job as a Santa Claus at McDonald's . Convicted: Norman Burbank (seen in a picture from his Facebook) was sentenced to 12 years in prison in 1998 following the sexual assault of an 11-year-old boy in Ohio . The McDonald's store released a statement about the incident. However it remains unclear whether any background checks were done before Burbank was assigned the job. 'We take this matter very seriously as the safety of our guests are our top priority,' the statement said. 'We are looking into the situation and gathering all the evidence.' Under Texas law, there are only a handful of jobs that registered sex offenders are legally not allowed to perform. They are limousine and bus driver, taxi cab driver and amusement park operator.","Norman Burbank, 54, taken into custody Saturday in Burbank, Texas .

"The Co-op Bank would need to be bailed out if there was an 'Armageddon' recession while state-owned RBS and Lloyds would be severely tested, it was revealed today. The Bank of England has stress-tested how Britain's eight major banks and building societies would fare if the UK undergoes a crisis wiping a third off house prices and the economy imploded. The Co-op Bank's capital would be exhausted if that happened with its capital ratio falling to a theoretical minus 2.6 per cent, the Bank of England said. In total the eight high street banks and building societies would lose £13billion. Before the results were released Co-op Bank boss Niall Booker admitted it would be 'no surprise' if it fails to pass  after its near-collapse last year. Scroll down for video . Failed: The Co-op Bank's capital would be exhausted if Britain was hit by an 'Armageddon' recession, the Bank of England has said . Scandal: Shamed Reverend Paul Flowers quit the troubled bank in June last year  having bought hard drugs, right, and used rent boys. It came shortly after a £1.5billion black hole emerged in the bank's finances . He added: 'The bank is much stronger than a year ago. As the regulator notes today, we have achieved the target of building our capital base and the actions we have taken during the first year of our business plan have made the bank more secure for the benefit of all stakeholders.' The bank was told today it must cut its loan book by £5.5 billion - but said the Bank of England's minus 2.6 per cent capital figure was the case a year ago but not today. Previously it had a £1.5 billion hole was discovered in its finances, following its ill-fated purchase of the Britannia building society and attempts to buy more than 600 Lloyds branches. It was also hit by scandal after Reverend Paul Flowers quit the £132,000-a-year job as chairman for taking hard drugs and using rent boys. He ran the bank even though he had no major banking experience. The Royal Bank of Scotland - 80 per cent -owned by the taxpayer - just passed the test while Lloyds Bank, 25 per cent-controlled by the Treasury, also slipped through. The test examined how lenders' balance sheets would stand up to a potential Doomsday scenario of economic crisis by calculating the ratio of capital against loan assets on their balance sheets in such an event. It judged that Lloyds, 25 per cent owned by the taxpayer, would fall to a capital ratio of five per cent under such a scenario, though by taking severe actions such as cost-cutting this would be 5.3 per cent. It compares with a minimum benchmark set by the Bank of 4.5 per cent. The group, which includes the Halifax and is heavily exposed to the UK housing market, 'remains susceptible to a severe economic downturn', the test found. But it said that, in light of the measures it already had in train, it did not require Lloyds to submit a revised capital plan. The results did not comment on whether the test would affect Lloyds' ability to pay a dividend next year, though it assumed that payouts would not be made in the stress scenario. In trouble: RBS and Lloyds, who were bailed out by the taxpayer in the last recession, scraped through the stress test . For RBS, 80 per cent owned by the state, the capital ratio would fall to 4.6 per cent in the stress scenario, or 5.2 per cent after 'strategic management actions' which could include cost-cutting. The Bank said it would ordinarily have required RBS to submit a revised capital plan but, given the progress already made and the capital strengthening actions in its updated plans, this would not be necessary. Allowing for emergency 'management actions', Barclays would see its capital ratio fall to 7.5 per cent under the scenario with HSBC scoring 8.7 per cent, Nationwide 6.7 per cent, Santander UK 7.9 per cent and Standard Chartered 8.1 per cent. Bank of England governor Mark Carney said following today's exercise: 'This was a demanding test. 'The results show that the core of the banking system is significantly more resilient, that it has the strength to continue to serve the real economy even in a severe stress, and that growing confidence in the system is merited.'","Bank of England tested eight financial institutions to see if they would fail .

"A Massachusetts woman has been indicted on two murder charges after the skeletal remains of three babies were found in her filthy home crawling with vermin in September, it was announced today. Erika Murray, 31, has been held on $1million bail after pleading not guilty to earlier charges, including fetal death concealment, reckless endangerment, assault and battery on a child and animal cruelty. Murray's attorney, Keith Halpern, said on Tuesday he's disappointed prosecutors decided to upgrade the charges. Scroll down for video . In court: Erika Murray (left), 31, has been indicted on two murder in the death of her babies whose remains were found in her home last fall. Rivera's boyfriend and the father of her children, 38-year-old Raymond Rivera (right), has been charged with child abuse and neglect . House of death: Three of Murray's children were found dead inside the Blackstone, Massachusetts, home in September . 'There's no evidence that she did anything to cause the death of any of these infants,' Halpern said. 'There's no evidence of how they died.' Murray's four children, ranging from 5 months to 13 years old, were removed from the house in Blackstone in August and placed in state custody. Prosecutors said the 5-month-old and a 3-year-old were found covered in their own feces and had been severely neglected. Police later searched the house and found the babies' remains hanging in bedroom closets. Also Tuesday, Murray's boyfriend, 38-year-old Raymond Rivera, who lived in the house, was arrested in Uxbridge and charged with child abuse and neglect related to the two younger children. Shocking clutter: Graphic photos have been released of a house of horrors in Blackstone where three dead babies were discovered . No place to raise a child: Mounds of refuse mixed in with old furniture, discarded electronic equipment, empty soda cans and food wrappings were found inside the family home . Bio-hazard: Cleanup crews in full hazmat suits and respirators spent several days in September removed piles of garbage from the Blackstone home . Prosecutors said DNA showed he is the father of all of Murray's children. Rivera pleaded not guilty to two counts of assault and battery on a child, two counts of reckless endangerment of a child, two counts of animal cruelty and one count of illegally growing marijuana. His bail was set at $100,000. Last month, Rivera tearfully recounted how he lived in the basement most of the time and had no idea what was going on in the rest of the house, but a prosecutor said at his arraignment that Rivera slept with Murray every night in a room near where the younger children were. On Tuesday, a prosecutor in court quoted a pediatrician as saying that this was the worst case of child neglect she has ever come in contact with in her practice, reported MyFox Boston. The state Department of Children and Families took custody of four children ranging in age from 5-months old to 13-years-old from the Blackstone home in August. The two youngest survivors were found covered in their own feces, malnourished and severely neglected. They did not appear to have ever been taken outside the house. The remains of the three babies, two of them almost entirely skeletal, were found in the home in September. Razed to the ground: The residence was demolished in October after having been condemned by the town . The dead infants were reportedly dressed in diapers and onesies, and stuffed inside bags hanging in upstairs closets. The house, which is owned by Rivera's sister, was vermin-infested, with rooms filled with trash, feces smeared on walls, soiled diapers and the remains of several animals.  It has since been condemned and demolished. It took clean-up crews 90 hours spread over four days of work to clear out Murray's house before heavy machinery was brought in to raze it to the ground. The clean-up and demolition cost the City of Blacktone just under $30,000. Murray's four surviving kids were rescued August 28 after her 10-year-old son went to a neighbor's home asking for help to quieten the crying baby. The neighbor found the youngest child covered in his own feces. Neither the baby nor Murray's three-year-old child have birth records and both are severely malnourished. authorities said .","Erika Murray, 31, has been held on $1million bail after pleading not guilty to earlier charges, including fetal death concealment .

"A  Ukip candidate who posted a map on his Facebook page which calls Africa 'Bongo Bongo Land' has been banned from speaking at a secondary school following protests by parents. David Little, parliamentary candidate for Dover and Deal in Kent, caused outrage last month after he posted a spoof 'Ukip map of the world' on his social media account. Mr Little, a father-of-two, has now said 'mob rule' has prevailed after Castle Community College in Deal and Walmer withdrew its invitation to him to give a lecture about the importance of democracy. A Ukip candidate was banned from giving a school talk after posting this spoof on Facebook. It was meant to lampoon Ukip's perceived prejudices with deliberately offensive jibes at 'poofters' and 'Bongo Bongo land' Outcast: David Little has now been banned from speaking at a local school after parents protested . The U-turn came after parents threatened to picket the school in protest. The Ukip Map of the World was a spoof drawn for the politicalbetting.com website by cartoonist Martha Richler, known as Marf. Lampooning Ukip's perceived prejudices, it also refers to French people as cheese-eating, beret-wearing frogs and people in London as 'cosmopolitan poofters' - foreshadowing the use of the homophobic word this week by Ukip candidate Kerry Smith. At the time Mr Little told the Mirror: 'I love Marf's cartoons and I thought it was a brilliant bit of satire lampooning UKIP. 'It's clearly a joke at UKIP's expense. I think it's really important to laugh at yourself now and again.' Mr Little, who hopes to stand for the Dover constituency at next May's election, was due to speak at the school on Thursday. He said: 'What do they think I'm going to do? Set fire to their kids?' 'I'm quite upset - and that's being politically correct. This Thursday I'd been invited to go along and speak to the students at Castle Community. Castle Community College in Deal and Walmer (pictured) withdrew its invitation to Mr Little to give a lecture . 'Then I got a phone call yesterday saying that some parents had objected. If I turned up they were going to picket the school. 'We are a legitimate political party. We've got members of Parliament, members of European Parliament, we've got councillors across the UK. 'This is an affront to democracy. How can we speak to children about democracy, about the rule of law if I can't speak to them? Tory MP Charlie Elphicke said it is important all views are listened to to ensure people have choice . 'And they haven't determined how many have complained. Is it one? Three? Three hundred?' 'Mob rule has won.' Mr Little, who owns a printing company, said it was not the first time his membership of Ukip had landed him in hot water. Last month football fans threatened to boycott a Dover Athletic match after he attempted to sponsor it under the Ukip banner. The details were eventually  changed to read 'David Little and Friends'. Charlie Elphicke, Tory MP for Deal and Dover, said of the parents' protest: 'It's really important to remember the values of our White Cliffs: On one hand there's free speech. 'They stand as a hallowed ground as a warning against extremism and hate. 'I think its very important that all views are listened to. It's important that people see there is a choice: Extremism and hate from Ukip and hope and the future from us.' But the cartoonist - despite drawing her work because she strongly disagrees with Ukip - said it was wrong of the school to censor Mr Little. Martha Richler told MailOnline: 'I thought it was to his credit that he could laugh at himself. 'I think in a way it's best for all of us to hear what people are thinking. The moment we start censoring each other it makes it much trickier and drives it all underground. 'Although I hate to hear it, I think it's best for all of us to know what people are really thinking.' The school has not yet responded to a request for a comment. Last month MailOnline reported that Ukip member Mike Ward claimed he was asked to step down from his role as Head of Governors at Eskdale School in Whitby, North Yorkshire after he became a member of Ukip. The Scarborough councillor, 70, who had previously stood as an independent, said he was invited to a meeting with headteacher Sue Whelan after his political switch was reported in local media. He said: 'She then asked me to resign saying Ukip’s policies were against the ethos of the school.'","Ukip candidate banned from speaking at school after parents protested .

"After suffering four devastating miscarriages, Grace and James Slattery resigned themselves to the fact they would never have a child together. But they are now preparing to celebrate their first Christmas as a very extended family, after Mrs Slattery, 32, miraculously gave birth to quadruplets. The couple, from County Limerick, Ireland, spend four years trying to have children and tragically suffered four miscarriages. They had suffered such heartache with each miscarriage they decided not to put themselves through IVF treatment, and gave up their dream of having a baby together. It was then that, incredibly, the couple received the news that Mrs Slattery had become pregnant completely naturally. What came next was even more of a shock: she was pregnant with quadruplets. Grace Slattery, 32, had suffered four miscarriages which had left her heartbroken. But soon afterwards she found out she was pregnant - with quadruplets. She gave birth to  Mollie Rose (left, dressed as a reindeer),   Lucas James (second from left, dressed as Santa), Lily-Grace May (second from right, dressed as a Santa in stripy trousers) and Amelia Helen (right, dressed as an elf) Mr and Mrs Slattery had given up on having children after the miscarriages, and had even turned down IVF treatment in case it didn't work. Now, they are looking forward to their first Christmas with their new family . The babies were born by Caesarean section when Mrs Slattery was 32 weeks pregnant. One daughter, Amelia, was born with a congenital defect, but luckily was big enough to survive the surgery she needed . Doctors said the story really is a miracle, as the chances of conceiving quadruplets naturally is around one in 10,000. Now, Mr and Mrs Slattery are looking forward to celebrating their first Christmas together with their now seven-month-old babies. Mrs Slattery said: 'We call them our fantastic four. We cannot believe our babies are seven months old now - time flies and we are so looking forward to their first Christmas. 'Friends and family have been showering them with presents already- they have a Christmas songs CD which they love and helps to calm them down.' 'The babies are our Christmas miracles - we are blessed. 'Just when we thought we couldn't go through any more and we were ready to give up, we received the best news ever. 'I really want to encourage other women to keep trying, because if we'd given up we wouldn't have the babies we do now.' Miss Leila Hanna, Consultant Gynaecologist and Obstetrician at Queen Mary's Hospital in London and BMI The Sloane Hospital, said the chances of conceiving quadruplets is ‘extremely rare’ She told MailOnline: ‘If it’s totally spontaneous, the incidence of natural quadruplets is one in 10,000.’ She added that Mr and Mrs Slattery’s story should give hope to others who have had miscarriages in the past. She said: ‘Many people who have recurrent miscarriages, there is no reason why. Doctors can’t find a reason why. ‘There is a huge miscarriage service in central London. One of the most important things it does to help these women give support and care. ‘Someone needs to help them keep going, not to give up, because they will get there eventually.’ ‘This is what happened to this couple - they had a bad run but then they got their stroke of luck.’ However, she warned giving birth to quadruplets does come with some increased health risks for mother and baby. ‘Multiple pregnancies increase the risk of developing high blood pressure. The mother will need to have Caesarean, which is a major surgery. ‘The babies come a lot earlier, they will need neonatal help. 'But in the UK if a woman gets to 32 weeks and the babies are well grown, there is a 97 per cent chance they will survive.' The couple's daughters Amelia Helen, Mollie Rose, Lily-Grace May, and son, Lucas James will enjoy their first experience of sitting by the Christmas tree and opening presents, as their parents are kept busy looking after them. Mrs Slattery said: 'We are going to my parents for Christmas dinner so we can actually all sit down and enjoy it. 'Otherwise, James and I would be so busy with all the babies we would probably end up having Christmas dinner really late, in front of the TV. 'We want this Christmas to be magical - as we are so grateful to have all of our babies with us.' And one of their daughters, Amelia, is a double miracle. She was born with a birth defect and her parents were told she would only last a few hours after being born. Amelia was diagnosed with a congenital diaphragmatic hernia - a hole in the diaphragm that allows the contents of the abdomen to move into the chest cavity and the organs to move into the wrong place. Mrs Slattery said: 'We were told if Amelia was born too small, no surgeon would operate on her and due to her hernia, her heart was in the wrong place and lungs weren't properly developed.' Thankfully, at 4lbs 3oz, Amelia was the biggest of the bunch and she had life-saving surgery as soon as she was born. Mrs Slattery said: 'We are so thankful to the Crumlin Children's Hospital for saving our little girl's life. 'She has regular check-ups but has been a little fighter from the word go - she bit the doctor in the hospital!' Mr and Mrs Slattery still remember how they had almost given up hope of having the family they always dreamed of. Even when they were told she was pregnant, they remained cynical because of the four previous miscarriages they'd suffered. Mrs Slattery said: 'When we went for the babies' first scan we thought we'd lost another baby. 'But we were given amazing news that we were definitely pregnant, everything was well and we were actually having quads. 'We left with mixed emotions as we were essentially told not to hold our breath, as quads usually don't survive.' The couple were told to not get their hopes up at every appointment for the next 26 weeks. The babies were finally born the day before Mrs Slattery was due to have a C-section at 32 weeks and six days. Amelia Helen was the heaviest at 4lbs 3oz (right) , and Mollie Rose was the smallest weighing 2lbs 15oz (second from right). Their brother Lucas James was born weighing 3lbs 10oz (left) and sister Lily- Grace May weighed 3lbs 4oz (second from left) The quads, who were born in May this year, get through 35 nappies a day, their mother said . Amelia Helen was the heaviest at 4lbs 3oz, and Mollie Rose was the smallest weighing 2lbs 15oz. Their brother Lucas James was born weighing 3lbs 10oz and sister Lily- Grace May weighed 3lbs 4oz. Mrs Slattery said: 'We are so glad our babies survived. We are delighted with our four healthy and happy little miracles. I never let myself dream this could happen.' The quads, who were born in May this year, get through 35 nappies a day and certainly have childminder Grace and insulation consultant James rushed off their feet. Mrs Slattery said: 'The babies are eating three meals a day now plus two bottles and are certainly keeping us busy. I worked as a child minder for years but nothing could have prepared me for this. 'It's hard work but it is so worth it to see our healthy, happy children. 'I can't wait to see their faces when they open their Micky Mouse teddies on Christmas day - they are mad for Disney.' 'I can't wait to see their faces when they open their Micky Mouse teddies on Christmas day- they are mad for Disney,' Mrs Slattery says .","Grace and James Slattery, 32 and 33, suffered four miscarriages .

"The BBC could give up its right to broadcast part of the Wimbledon tennis championship under plans being drawn up by senior executives. In a move that is likely to dismay many tennis fans, coverage of the event may be shared with BT. It would mean some matches would only be available to subscribers of the pay-TV channel. Popular: Andy Murray’s victory in the Wimbledon men’s final in 2013 drew in the largest number of viewers since at least 1990. A peak of 17.3 million viewers tuned in to BBC One to watch the match . According to The Times, senior BBC executives have held talks with BT but have yet to agree to a deal. The corporation has been Wimbledon’s exclusive broadcaster in the UK for nearly 80 years. It reportedly costs the BBC up to £40million a year to broadcast - a large part of the tournament’s £150million revenue. By sharing its rights with BT, the corporation would make significant savings. It was also reported that the BBC was considering more cost-cutting measures, including commercial partnerships, as it braces itself for further cuts to its licence fee. Sue Barker on the BBC: The corporation's licence fee-payers have long enjoyed Wimbledon free of charge . BBC licence fee-payers have long enjoyed Wimbledon free of charge. Andy Murray’s victory in the Wimbledon men’s final in 2013 drew in the largest number of viewers since at least 1990. A peak of 17.3 million viewers tuned in to BBC One to watch the match. In recent years, viewers have seen the BBC share its exclusive Formula One rights with BSkyB and lose the French Open to ITV. It is also thought ITV is preparing to bid for BBC Match of the Day’s right to air highlights of the Premier League football. The BBC is currently contracted to cover Wimbledon until 2017. The tournament has a protected status under rules drawn up by the broadcasting watchdog Ofcom. Wimbledon coverage: (From left) John McEnroe, Tim Henman, Sue Barker, John Inverdale and Boris Becker . It means the finals weekend must be freely available on terrestrial television, although other matches may be shown live on pay-TV channels so long as the BBC shows daily highlights. The BBC last night refused to comment on the deal. A spokesman told the Mail: ‘We never comment on rights.’  BT also declined to comment yesterday. The news comes amid reports BBC Sport is set to lose Football League highlights rights to Channel 5. The Football League is due to announce a three-year deal for all their divisions plus the Capital One Cup, starting from next season, and C5 is understood to have won the contract. It was thought to have been sealed with an estimated offer of £2million a year and a pledge to screen their show at 9pm on Saturdays.","Would mean some matches would only be available to BT subscribers .

"Investigators want to question two potential witnesses who were near a downtown Los Angeles fire last week that reduced an apartment construction site to ashes. Authorities released separate videos of two men taken near the scene. In one, a man wearing a dark jacket and baseball cap appears to attempt to climb over a fence along the edge of the fire, but is pulled to safety by firefighters. In another, a man with a backpack and sports jersey walks along a darkened street.

Seeking this man: A man wearing a dark jacket and baseball cap appears to attempt to climb over a fence along the edge of the fire, but is pulled to safety by firefighters . A statement Monday from the Los Angeles Fire Department said the men are not considered suspects. Investigators are asking for the public's help identifying them. More than 250 firefighters fought the blaze December 8, that sent up flames that were visible for miles. City arson investigators were joined by a federal team last week at the scorched remains of  apartment complex destroyed by the raging fire that also damaged adjacent office towers. 'It's a city block burned to the ground,' Carlos A. Canino, special agent in charge of the ATF Los Angeles field division, said of the scope of the probe. The 1.3 million-square-foot building was still in the wood framing stage when it ignited just before 1:30 a.m. on December 8, leaving an area measuring 900 feet by 200 feet to investigate.

Watch video of a man being pulled away by firefighters... Police also want to question this man... Suspicion of arson arose because of how quickly and completely the building became involved with flames. 'We are not treating this as a criminal investigation, but we are not ruling anything out,' said Los Angeles Fire Department Chief Ralph Terrazas. Federal assistance came in the form of a national response team from the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. They began the day with a safety evaluation of the site. Investigators will interview witnesses, check security cameras and personal video of the fire, and will use dogs that can sniff fire accelerants. Canino said there was a great deal of video to review, and a security guard was also being interviewed. He said the fire was initially reported to 911 by a passerby using a cellphone.

"Hunched in their snow burrows, Britain's mountain hares brave some of the harshest conditions our island can throw at them. And for the past three years, photographer Andy Howard has shared the freezing temperatures, blizzards and snow storms with them, often lying in the snow for hours to capture incredible images of the typically timid animals. The 43-year-old, who also acts as a mountain guide, says the hares are one of Britain's truly native creatures, having been here since the last ice age. Scroll down for video . A British mountain hare hunches in the snow to try and keep out the cold during freezing conditions in the Scottish Highlands . 'I believe to truly understand a species you have to spend as much time as possible with them and in their environment,' he said. 'This day in particular, a few weeks ago, was the hardest I've experienced to date. 'It was persistent blizzards for most of the day and at times I was wading up to my chest through snow drifts. 'Mountain hares have to endure some of the harshest conditions found in the UK. I try to photograph the mountain hares at least once a fortnight throughout the year, this way I can capture their lives in all types of weather conditions they have to endure, even the severest winter storms.' Photographer Andy Howard has braved blizzards and icy temperatures to capture these incredible images of the typically timid animals in their natural habitat . Andy has spent three years capturing the stunning photographs as part of the Mountain Hares of the Cairngorms project . Andy has one particular hare that he has known for the past three years which is more than happy to have his picture taken. 'It's not unusual for me to spend four or five hours with my favourite hare. In fact I find if I talk to him he relaxes more and  at times he has even fallen asleep in front of me. No wild animal would do this if it wasn't totally relaxed in your presence' As part of Andy's ongoing photographic project with the Mountain Hares of the Cairngorms he paid repeat visits to the same mountain hare over a 23 day period. In these series of images you can see the hare's coat (pelage) morphing from its brown summer colour to its thick white winter coat. As it happens, this occurred just in the nick of time as the first heavy snow fall of the winter came a few days later. Mountain hares are indigenous to Britain having survived from the last ice age. They are now rarely found in the UK below 500m. They are also spread across Europe, from Scandinavia to Siberia. Smaller than the more common European hare, the species adapted to live in polar and mountainous habitats. During the winter months, their fur changes from brown to white to help camouflage among the snow and avoid predators such as eagles and foxes. The hares are also hunted for sport as small game and have been subject to culling because they allegedly carried a tick borne virus which can kill grouse chicks. Exact numbers of mountain hares in Scotland are unknown by research by the British Trust for Ornithology found local populations had fallen by 43 per cent since 1995. Andy added: 'In winter they are almost completely white and through the spring they moult, become a mottled brown and white colour and in summer they are brown a grey twinge, the grey colour can look like a shade of blue, in fact in the Highlands they are often referred to as blue hares. 'Mountain hares are one of only a few truly native species of mammals found in the UK. 'They have survived from the last ice age. They live in the high mountains of Scotland and prosper on well managed grouse moors, which in turn brings them into conflict with the grouse shooting fraternity as it's believed they pass on blood sucking ticks on to young grouse. 'Mountain hares spend all year exposed to all elements and in winter move to the more sheltered leeward sides of the mountains. 'Unlike rabbits, hares don't burrow but live in shallow scrapes called forms. In the winter months hares are often completely covered in snow with just their heads visible above the snow, the snow acts as insulation against the bitter winds which can reach as low as minus forty with the wind chill.' Andy spends most of his time photographing and guiding other wildlife photographers in the Cairngorm Mountains of Scotland. He added: 'Mountain hare photography takes a lot of patience as hares will often sit for hours without moving, it can also take up to two hours to get close enough to take a picture due to their timid nature. 'After all their Latin name is Lepus timidus. 'Good field craft and a solid understanding of their behaviour is essential to be a successful hare photographer. Also as important is layers of thermals and down jackets to stay dry and warm.' The mountain hares' coat changes colour in the winter from brown to white to match its snowy surroundings .","Photographer Andy Howard has spent three years following the hares .

"Mario Stojka has been jailed for 3 years for a violent street robbery of a 78-year-old woman in Bradford and had similar previous convictions in Slovakia . A violent robber who mugged an elderly woman in the street and tried to tear off her jewellery had been allowed into Britain despite a string of previous convictions in his native Slovakia. Mario Stojka, 30, tried to rip off Jean Crowther's watch and rings before he snatched £200 in cash from her handbag as the 78-year-old desperately tried to defend herself with her walking stick in Bradford, west Yorkshire. The pensioner is now too scared to go out alone to do her weekly shop or go to bingo with friends. Stojka, who has been cautioned twice for shoplifting since he came to the UK, has also served time in prison in Slovakia for theft, credit fraud and dangerous and threatening behaviour, Bradford Crown Court heard. MPs have called for the Slovakian to be deported and for people coming to the UK to have criminal record checks, which does not currently happen as a matter of course on people coming to the UK from the EU. Stojka admitted robbing the pensioner on February 4 and was jailed for three years and four months. The court heard that on this day Mrs Crowther was waiting for a taxi home after her latest weekly shopping trip. Stojka, who is known to have personality issues,  was wearing make-up and a headscarf at the time and approached the pensioner and complimented her. He then grabbed the cross and chain round her neck and tried to rip off her rings and watch before snatching the money she had just withdrawn. Charlotte Eastwood, prosecuting, said: 'He asked if she was okay and if she needed help. 'He complimented her on her scarf and then tried to tug off her jewellery. She was fighting back by pushing him with her walking stick but it had no effect.' The attack was witnessed by passers-by Safdar Yousaf and Mushtak Ahmed, who retrieved Mrs Crowther's money and gave chase - but Stojka got away. They were commended by Judge Neil Davey QC for their efforts. In her victim impact statement, Mrs Crowther, now 79, said she was too afraid to make her weekly shopping trip to the centre of Bradford and her trips out to bingo were a struggle. She was nervous at home, had difficulty sleeping and feared that any noise in the night was Stojka 'coming to get her.' The court heard that Stojka had 'matters outstanding' against him in Slovakia but no direction was made to deport him by the judge. After the case, MP George Galloway, whose constituency includes Bradford city centre, called for Stojka to be deported when he serves his sentence. Bradford Crown Court heard that Stojka had a string of previous convictions for similar crimes in Slovakia . 'It is entirely wrong that such criminals should be allowed to stay in Britain and efforts should be made to check the criminal records of people wanting to come to the UK,' he said. Under current Home Office rules people coming into the UK are checked against security, police and immigration 'watch lists.' Responsibility for adding serious crimes to watch lists lies with the country where they are committed. Philip Davies, Conservative MP for Shipley said the case was another reason why he felt Britain should leave the EU. He said: 'He is clearly a despicable piece of work. He should be kicked straight out of the country when he comes out of prison. 'This is the problem of being in the EU. The free movement of people opens the door to criminals. This man is one of many.' Detective Inspector Richard Partis, from West Yorkshire Police, said: 'Stojka pretended to show concern for his vulnerable victim, before attempting to rob her of her possessions. 'We would like to thank the members of the public who intervened and brought this to the attention of our officers. 'Violent crimes such as robbery will not be tolerated in Bradford District and police will look to take the strongest action possible against offenders.'","Mario Stojka mugged 78-year-old woman in street in Bradford, Yorkshire .

"A Christmas attraction designed by Laurence Llewelyn-Bowen has been shut down after after a major financial back pulled out - leaving furious parents up to £100 out of pocket. The celebrity interior designer said he was 'extremely surprised' after finding out on Twitter that the Magical Journey, based at the Belfry Hotel, in Sutton Coldfield, Birmingham, had closed as of today. The festive experience has been marred with controversy since opening its doors in November and was forced to close for three days following a furious backlash from angry parents. Scroll down for video . Laurence Llewelyn-Bowen (pictured centre) said he was 'extremely surprised' after finding out on Twitter that the Magical Journey had closed as of today .

Laurence Llewelyn-Bowen said he found out about the closure of the attraction through Twitter . Closed: The attraction has been shut down after after a major financial back pulled out - with just nine opening days left . Laurence Llewelyn-Bowen (pictured) said he found the closure of the attraction 'absolutely shocking' The furore broke out after a barrage of complaints from parents on the first day over elves smoking, rubbish being strewn across the paths and wooden pallets covered in plastic tarpaulin left lying around. It reopened several days later after work to improve it, winning positive customer reviews - but last night the organisers said they had been 'left in the lurch' and could not find a replacement backer. This morning there were claims that the crisis-hit attraction crumbled under pressure to pay its staff wages of over £100,000 per month - just nine days before Christmas. Angry parents have been told to contact their card providers for refunds with many buying tickets for their entire families. Mr Llewelyn-Bowen said he had not given any financial support to the project and was unaware who the backer was. He said: 'It's absolutely shocking. We found out by Twitter. Everybody was in bed feeling Christmassy and now we are not feeling very Christmassy at all. 'I was really impressed with the way they addressed all the issues the first time around and the energy and resources that went into it so I'm extremely surprised the towel's been thrown in at this stage. 'I feel appalling it is not the happy experience I really want it to be. I feel extremely sorry for everybody let down in the next nine days and also for the staff who worked on the front-line. I'm hoping they will get their money back. Scenes like this greeted visitors when the site first opened. Despite a raft of measures to make improvements, the attraction has now been closed with just nine days left before Christmas . Mr Llewelyn-Bowen (pictured) said he had not given any financial support to the project and was unaware who the backer was . Organisers said those who had bought tickets would need to contact their own debit or credit card providers to claim a refund through the Chargeback scheme . 'On a personal level I was so excited by the idea of designing Christmas. It seemed a perfect opportunity. I really did feel (organiser) Paul Dolan and his team were the right people to do it. 'In hindsight they absolutely were not experienced enough for this sort of event. 'I was just commissioned to create some design concepts for the experience. There was no financial backing from my point of view and no involvement in the management. 'I feel very much I was the designer and I'm a very public face so people are cross with me.' The presenter added he would be donating his fee, the amount of which he would not confirm, to a Birmingham children's hospice and said: 'I do not want to make any money at all out of this experience.' Gemma Eales said she had paid almost £100 to attend the winter wonderland in what was supposed to be a pre-Christmas treat for children Ben, nine, Toby, six and Lucy, five. But she and husband Richard were left stunned when they received an email today telling her the Magical Journey was closing for good due to financial difficulties. 'I’m not very happy.' she said. 'I was quite upset when I rang my bank, and they explained I’ll have to fill out some forms, and they’ll take some time to process. 'It will be January by the time I get a refund, if I get one at all. The email was quite abrupt, and it seems unfair when you have saved up for it. 'My daughter Lucy has been quite poorly this year- having tonsilitis more than 10 times – so we wanted to do something really special for her. 'I have been looking on websites of everywhere I can think of but they are all booked up.

She is pictured with Ben (left) and Toby (centre) Packing up: Workers could be seen removing furniture from the site this morning - hours after families had been told the attraction had been closed early . 'I was fuming this morning, but I am trying to stay calm now. I’ll have to break my news to my daughter when I pick her up from school later. She was really excited about it, and i’m afraid she is going to be really disappointed. Mother-of-two Ellie Gallagher, 36, had booked to visit the attraction on Sunday with her children Zak, six, and Jess, nine. The beautician, from Sutton Coldfield, West Midlands, said: 'We are fuming really. One of our children is nine and this is the last year she can really enjoy the magic of Christmas. So we were really excited. 'We are devastated because we organised this back in October and we were really looking forward to it. 'There is no guarantee we will get our money back yet. We are really sad. It has put a dampener on Christmas.' Kayleigh Parsons, 27, turned up at the attraction today only to be turned away after travelling from Lichfield, Staffordshire. She added: 'My daughter is distraught. She wanted to meet Santa. It has ruined Christmas and they have been an absolute shambles. It's a disgrace really.' Organisers spent three days loading the Magical Journey with extra fake snow to improve on the opening day . But pictures later showed the fake snow had dissolved into mud in some parts during the previous night's downpour . Some took to social media to vent their frustration. Annie Hawkins wrote: 'Absolutely disgusting. How are parents who have told their children about the event, going to explain the ""cancellation"". Should be ashamed.' Kelly Haney posted: 'This is just disgraceful!!!!! I have a little girl who thinks she is going on a magical journey on Wednesday!! How do you explain to her she’s not going on a magical journey no more??' The £22.50-a-child Magical Journey had been plagued by difficulties since opening amid an avalanche of criticism in November. An improvement drive saw Santa Claus hauled in for extra training. Bosses also conceded it was 'possible' that visitors had seen some elves smoking. And they admitted a festive train broke down after running out of fuel. Last weekend the organisers were forced to suspend the review section of the attraction's website after claiming 'negative' comments had been posted by people who had not visited the wonderland. A statement on the Magical Journey's website said: 'We are really sorry to have to tell you this, but as of tomorrow (Tuesday 16 December 2014) The Magical Journey, based at The Belfry, Sutton Coldfield, will no longer be in operation. 'We are truly sorry. After all we've been through having to shutdown in the final week is devastating. Although we had quite the time of it in the press and on social media, feedback was great with over 600 four and five star reviews. 'However, today a key financial backer has dropped out leaving us in the lurch. We have tried desperately over the last few hours to find a replacement but to no avail. The furore broke out after a barrage of complaints from parents on the first day over elves smoking, rubbish being strewn across the paths and wooden pallets covered in plastic tarpaulin left lying around . Last night the organisers said they had been 'left in the lurch' and could not find a replacement financial back . Organisers have told ticket holders not to call the Belfry Hotel, where the attraction was operating, as it has 'no affiliation' to the Magical Journey . 'We are very sorry to have to break the news like this but we have explored all our options, and the situation leaves us with no alternative other than close The Magical Journey. 'Please do not contact The Belfry Hotel as they have no affiliation to the Magical Journey and they will not be able to assist you in any way.' Organisers said those who had bought tickets would need to contact their own debit or credit card providers to claim a refund through the Chargeback scheme. An automated message on the attractions phone line said all customers who had booked for the next nine days would receive an email about how to get a refund. A source alleged this morning that the company employed around 200 people and was forced to close suddenly to ensure it could pay its employees for the time they had already worked. The source, who worked with the attraction, said bosses were unable to find a replacement at short notice after the financial backer pulled out. It is understood staff will not receive payments for days they will no longer be working. The closure comes just days after a separate winter attraction, Yorkshire’s Magical Winterland temporarily closed a day after opening at the event centre in Harrogate. Parents claimed their children were left in tears as they entered a desolate warehouse with cardboard boxes and random material strewn all over the ground. The attraction re-opened for the final time on Friday with organisers saying it was shutting for good 'with great regret'.","The Magical Journey opened in Sutton Coldfield, Birmingham in November .

"A 79-year-old mother will be kicked out of her £1.2million home - after a judge ruled that she cannot share it with the grown-up son she hates. Elizabeth Ashley changed the locks on her home in Wandsworth, London in a bid to keep out her electrician son, Mitchim. But Judge Diana Faber ruled she had 'unlawfully excluded' him from the house he had mostly paid for and which he half owned. Court fight: Elizabeth Ashley (right) changed the locks on her home in Wandsworth, London in a bid to keep out her electrician son, Mitchim (left) The judge considered splitting the house in half so that Mrs Ashley could live on the ground floor and her son above her. But the breakdown of their relationship was so 'irretrievable' that forcing them to live in this way was bound to cause trouble, she said. In the end, the only solution was to force Mrs Ashley to sell the home where she had lived for almost 40 years and split the profits with her son. The enforced move was 'bound to lead to suffering' for Mrs Ashley, the court heard. But her tenacity in court showed she was 'well able to stand up for herself'. With her son's help, she had bought the house under the 'right to buy' scheme in 2001 for just £250,000, making close to a 500 per cent profit since, the court heard. And Judge Faber said she was sure the pensioner 'would be able to cope' with moving to 'a cheaper part of London'. Mrs Ashley moved into the house as a council tenant in 1976 and only managed to buy it when her son, now in his 50s, agreed to put in £155,000 of his own money. It had been his home since he was 14 but, in November 2012, his mother changed the locks and told him to stay away - even preventing him from collecting his belongings. The terraced home in Wansdworth, south west London, cost just £250,000 in 2001 . She insisted she had never agreed to a 50/50 ownership split and told Central London County Court: 'I don't want him there. Have I no rights as a person? 'After death yes, but during my life I don't want other people living there'. Mrs Ashley even launched a counter-claim for damages against her son, accusing him and his wife, Lorraine, of targeting her with a 'phone call harassment' campaign. But the judge said Mrs Ashley's central harassment allegation was 'probably concocted' because she was 'so angry' with her son. He had made an 'unpleasant tactical attempt' to question his mother's mental health and was 'less than wholly reliable as a witness'. But his mother had 'told the court substantially more untruths than he did' and her account of events had been 'thoroughly undermined', said the judge. There was, she ruled, no truth in Mrs Ashley's claim that she did not agree to a 50/50 split or that she had been put under pressure to sign documents she did not understand. She had 'exercised her free will' and had gained far more than her son from the spectacularly successful property investment, the court heard. He had sold his own home to raise the £155,000 and his mother 'knew full well' that the intention from the outset was to provide a home for both for them. The judge roundly rejected Mrs Ashley's claim that, for years, her son had only visited the house to collect his mail, walk the dog, and to 'bring women back'. Although he moved to Hastings, East Sussex, in 2006, he had treated the Wandsworth property as his home right up until the day his mother changed the locks. The judge said the only explanation for the unlawful 'lock out' of her son was that 'Mrs Ashley wanted the whole house for herself'. He had told her he wanted to spend more time there, but 'she wanted to live in the house alone'. Mr Ashley told the judge he had no desire to see his mother, who has nothing to live on but her pension, forced out of her home. He only wanted to retrieve his possessions and to sleep in the house for part of the week whilst he was working in London. 1976: Mrs Ashley moves in to home in Wandsworth, London as a council tenant . 2001: Purchases house for £250,000 with help of her son Mitchim who paid £155,000 . 2012: Mrs Ashley changes the locks and tells her son to stay away . October 2014: Both appear at Central London County Court after the dispute ends in legal action . December 2014: Judge orders that Mrs Ashley must sell the £1.2million property . Judge Faber said she had thought about a structural division of ground floor from first floor as a possible solution to the impasse. But she was convinced that that was bound to lead to 'continuing disputes' between the warring mother and son. She also considered allowing Mrs Ashley to stay in the house until she died, but ruled that that would hardly be fair on her son. Such an 'irretrievable breakdown' in their relationship meant a sale of the house was the only realistic option.

"It is an incredibly rare phenomenon - and the shot of a lifetime. A researcher at the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array telescope control center in the Atacama desert captured this amazing image of a rainbow high over the Chilean desert. The Operations Support Facility (OSF) lies some 2900 metres above sea level close to San Pedro de Atacama. Armin Silber, a researcher at the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array telescope control center in the Atacama desert captured this amazing image of a rainbow high over the Chilean desert. High on the Chajnantor plateau in the Chilean Andes, the European Southern Observatory (ESO), together with its international partners, is operating the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) — a state-of-the-art telescope to study light from some of the coldest objects in the Universe. This light has wavelengths of around a millimetre, between infrared light and radio waves, and is therefore known as millimetre and submillimetre radiation. ALMA comprises 66 high-precision antennas, spread over distances of up to 16 kilometres. This global collaboration is the largest ground-based astronomical project in existence. The rainbow was captured by European Space Observatory employee Armin Silber. This rare rainbow appears over the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) Operations Support Facility (OSF), which lies some 2900 metres above sea level close to San Pedro de Atacama. The OSF isn’t just a location for operating the giant ALMA Observatory; it is also where new technologies are assembled, integrated, and verified before they are transported to their final destination on Chajnantor. The technology has to be assembled and tested at the OSF because the air is much denser there than on the plateau, and workers can complete their tasks without the adverse health risks associated with working at high altitude. The telescope itself is high on the Chajnantor plateau in the Chilean Andes and is a state-of-the-art telescope to study light from some of the coldest objects in the Universe.

ALMA comprises 66 high-precision antennas, spread over distances of up to 16 kilometres. This global collaboration is the largest ground-based astronomical project in existence. The secret to Alma's incredible resolution comes from two factors: height and distance. The observatory's highest receivers sit on a plateau some 16,500ft (5,000 metres) above sea level. This is far above most of Earth's atmosphere and water vapour, which obscures observations. Astronomers working in Alma's facility at 9,500 feet (2,900 meters) must use supplemental oxygen for extended stays. With all the antennae working in unison as a giant telescope, the observatory will provide astronomers with a window into the early universe. The rainbow was captured at the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array telescope control center, where operators control the 'time machine telescope high in the mountains. This is where cosmic secrets wait to be discovered, said project director Pierre Cox, who added Alma is poised to reach its full potential next year . The $1.6 billion telescope, which began full-scale operation in March, has already spotted galaxies expelling gas and a star formation near the centre of the Milky Way's supermassive black hole. It also has captured the first image of an icy ring around a distant star. By collecting radio waves rather than optical light, Alma can look through the dense dust clouds of deep space. This will give astronomers a glimpse of galaxies from just after the Big Bang. It can also look at how individual stars and planets are formed. This could shine a light on our creation as it is believed the elements spewed out by dying stars went on the seed the sun, the planets and, eventually, humans.

"The parents of murdered schoolgirl April Jones today told of their relief as their daughter's grave finally got its headstone more than two years after her death. Partly shaped like a teddy bear, the black granite stone features two Welsh verses in honour of the five-year-old, one about a butterfly and the other about a shooting star. The stone has been put up near to the family home in Machynlleth, Mid Wales, and April's parents Coral and Paul said they were pleased it had been completed in time for Christmas. Tribute: Paul and Coral Jones, the parents of murdered schoolgirl April Jones have spoken of their relief as their daughter's grave finally got its headstone more than two years after her death . 'Beautiful': Partly shaped like a teddy bear, the black granite stone features two Welsh verses in honour of the five-year-old (right), one about a butterfly and the other about a shooting star . 'It’s April down to a tee,' said Mrs Jones, 42. 'She loved her teddies and was fascinated by butterflies and shooting stars. 'We’ve been waiting two years for this day. It’s lovely that the headstone will be in place for Christmas and we plan to visit her on Christmas Day.' Mr Jones, 46, added: 'It’s horrible seeing our daughter’s name on a cold stone in a graveyard but this is really lovely tribute to her.' Resting place: The stone has been put up near to the family home in Machynlleth, Mid Wales, and April's parents Coral and Paul said they were pleased it had been completed in time for Christmas . Fitting: Mrs Jones, 42, said the headstone was 'April down to a tee', as the little girl was 'fascinated by butterflies and shooting stars' April was just five when she vanished from the close-knit Bryn-y-Gog estate on October 1st, 2012, while playing on her bike. She was abducted by paedophile Mark Bridger who was found guilty of her murder after a month-long trial in May 2013. April’s body has never been fully recovered despite the biggest search in UK police history, but Bridger was handed a rare whole life jail term after fragments of her skull were found in his fireplace. The family held a funeral in September last year after her scant remains were released to them. She is buried in a graveyard just yards from where she was last seen alive. Mr and Mrs Jones made an emotional visit to the cemetery yesterday, accompanied by one of their daughter’s favourite teddies. Poignant: Mr and Mrs Jones made an emotional visit to the cemetery yesterday, accompanied by one of their daughter’s favourite teddies . Tender: The grave has been decorated with brightly-coloured flowers and photographs of April as a baby . Memories: Mrs Jones said that April was 'obsessed with Hello Kitty and, just before she was taken had put a Hello Kitty plaster on her favorite soft toy's paw . 'All of April’s teddies were precious to her but this one is particularly special,' said Mr Jones. 'It’s a little dog which she loved. She was obsessed with Hello Kitty and, just before she was taken, she put a Hello Kitty plaster on his paw. 'We thought it was a nice touch to bring him here today.' Mrs Jones added: 'Even though we had the funeral last year, we had to wait for the ground around April’s grave to settle before we could put the headstone up. 'It’s a massive relief now it’s finally here as before we just had a little tag with her name on it. It’s much more personal.' Tragedy: April’s body was never fully recovered despite the biggest search in UK police history, but killer Mark Bridger was handed a rare whole life jail term after fragments of her skull were found in his fireplace . The couple and their older children, Jazmin, 19, and Harley, 12, spent hours deciding on the design of the stone, which was manufactured by James Memorials, based in nearby Aberystwyth. The move comes just weeks after the house in which April is believed to have died was demolished. The Welsh government bought the cottage in remote Ceinws from its previous owner in order to raze it to the ground. Mrs Jones said: 'We wanted it to be perfect so we chose everything as a family. April was very proud to be Welsh and she went to a Welsh speaking school so it’s nice to have the Welsh words. They’re beautiful.' Mr Jones added: 'We’d like to thank everyone who has supported us over the past two years. We’ve had so many people fighting for us. 'If it wasn’t for the police, the search teams and the lawyers who worked on the case we might not have been able to bury April at all.' Guilty: Mark Bridger was jailed for life for the murder of five-year-old April . Mark Bridger, who was jailed for life but has refused to admit to killing April, snatched the five-year-old as she played in the street near her home in Machynlleth, Mid Wales. Her disappearance sparked the largest police search in British history, and her killer tried to cover his tracks by helping with the search before his arrest. Police believe Bridger dismembered April before dumping her body parts at various locations in the hills, rivers and forests surrounding his home in Ceinws, Mid Wales, after traces of her blood were found all over his rented cottage. Police raided his home and found evidence linked to the murder and a cache of child porn on his computer, including Facebook pictures of April and other local girls. Pools of April's blood were found under the carpet in front of the living room fire where small fragments of her bones were recovered by police. April's blood was also found in the bathroom and hallway of the cottage despite a desperate bid by Bridger to clean up his rented home using detergents and bleach. Father-of-six Bridger was given a whole-life tariff by a judge in May 2013 at Mold Crown Court after he was found guilty of her kidnap and murder. Sentencing Bridger, Mr Justice Griffith Williams said: 'There is no doubt in my mind that you are a paedophile, who has for some time harboured sexual and morbid fantasies about young girls.' He said Bridger abducted April for a 'sexual purpose' after he had been jilted by his girlfriend and then murdered the schoolgirl and disposed of her body to 'hide the evidence of your sexual abuse of her'.","Stone on five-year-old's grave complete two years after she was abducted .

"Ibrahim Mahter was one of the ringleaders of a sham marriage scam and helped organise at least seven fake weddings. He has been jailed for four years . Ringleaders of a sham marriage gang which arrange fake weddings for foreign men who wanted to gain British citizenship have been jailed. Ibrahim Mahter, 29, and Abdulgani Makrani, 66, organised at least seven fake marriages for men from Pakistan and India, offering women up to £8,000 to take a foreign husband. Nimisha Gosai, Kubrah Saiyed and Naima Makda - girlfriend of Mahter - acted as 'stooge wives' for the lucrative scam, which was run from a base in Leicester. Judge Robert Brown jailed all five and told them they had 'total disrespect' for both the institution of marriage and the UK's immigration laws. The court heard how Mahter and Makrani offered British women up to £8,000 for helping foreign men who wanted British citizenship. They were caught after a woman told police that she was forced into a marriage. All five defendants were charged with conspiracy to facilitate a breach of UK immigration law, between November 2005 and October 2012. Judge Brown said: 'I'm quite satisfied that the sentences in all your cases must be sentences of immediate custody. 'You showed a total disrespect for the institution of marriage and the UK immigration laws. 'There is widespread concern about this type of offending. Gosai admitted her role in the scam and the other four were convicted by a jury after trial. During the trial, Gary Short, prosecuting, said: 'This case is about the highly lucrative and very secretive world of the sham marriage.' Mahter was jailed for four years and his barrister described him as a man with 'limited influence, limited ability and limited intellect'. Makrani, who has mental health problems, was jailed for three-and-a-half years. The three women were given shorter sentences . Makda, 28, and Saiyed, 27, were each jailed for two-and-a-half years. Gosai was jailed for 14 months and the court heard she was involved in a marriage that never went ahead.  Her lawyer, Michael Garvey, said: 'She was a stooge wife and had no further role in planning these matters. Abdulgani Makrani (left) was jailed for three and a half years, Kubrah Saiyed (centre) and Naima Makda (right) were jailed for two years for their roles and are pictured leaving Leicester Crown Court during the trial . 'No actual marriage followed through. 'She admitted everything. She realised she was involved in matters she didn't really want to be involved in and she took steps to ensure nothing further happened.' Another defendant, Syed Mehtab, 36, from Uxbridge, London, was also found guilty of being involved in the conspiracy by the trial jury, and is due to be sentenced on January 19. Chief registrar Kevin Lewis said they were seeing up to 50 sham marriages in the Leicester area each year. He told the BBC: 'It is a growing crime affecting the whole country, and it is important that we see it and stop it.'","Ibrahim Mahter and Abdulgani Makrani arranged at least 7 sham marriages .

"Shot: 46-year-old Ramiro was hit by a bullet accidentally fired by an Albuquerque police officer . A police officer's gun accidentally went off as he crept through a broken window during an Albuquerque burglary investigation, wounding a man in an apartment below, officials said Monday. Police emphasized the shooting was accidental, but it occurred in an agency under intense scrutiny for a series of shootings over the past several years. 'He was sleeping here, then tried to go and get some water from the kitchen,' said the victim's sister, Alicia Armendariz. 46-year-old Ramiro Armendariz never made it back. In the blink of an eye, a bullet accidentally fired by an Albuquerque police officer struck him in the back. The latest incident happened early Sunday while police were investigating a break-in at a second-floor apartment, Albuquerque Police spokesman Simon Drobik said. The officer involved was climbing through one of the unit's windows when his gun accidentally went off, though authorities wouldn't say why. The stray bullet shot through the floor and into the apartment below. 'An officer went through the broken window, through the shards of glass, and at some point, accidentally – I can't confirm enough here – accidentally discharged his firearm,' he said. Unlucky: Police say it  happened while they were investigating a burglary on the second level of an apartment complex. The bullet passed through the floorboards and came out of the ceiling of the residence below . Investigation: The bullet cut straight through the floor of the apartment above and into Armendariz's home . Officers found the injured man on his couch complaining of pain. He was hospitalized in stable condition at University of New Mexico Hospital with injuries that were not life-threatening, Drobik said. On the mend: Armendariz was in surgery a majority of the day Sunday and is now recovering at a local hospital . Armendariz was in surgery a majority of the day Sunday and is now recovering at a local hospital. 'I want to emphasize this was an accidental shooting,' Drobik said. 'The officer involved in this is just torn up.' Drobik said the shooting occurred after officers took another man into custody. The officer has been placed on administrative leave, officials said. No names were released and no other injuries reported. The family says Armendariz is expected to recover. Albuquerque Police isn't identifying the officer whose gun went off but says he did have his lapel camera on. The shooting comes after Albuquerque officials recently signed an agreement with the U.S. Justice Department following a harsh report over police use of excess force. Albuquerque police have faced scrutiny for more than 40 officer shootings since 2010. So far this year, there have been seven police shootings — six fatal. Before Sunday, officers had not shot anyone since July, when 33-year-old Jeremy Robertson was killed by two officers during a foot chase from a gas station. Police say they're still investigating how that shot was fired but aren't identifying the officer whose gun went off . Albuquerque police said agents with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms were seeking to take Robertson into custody when he fled. Robertson pulled a handgun from his waist before he was shot, authorities said. According to court records, Robertson had two outstanding warrants on probation violations connected to charges of receiving and transferring stolen vehicles. The city is planning a series of community meetings next year to help develop an action plan for police reforms. NAACP Albuquerque president Harold Bailey said Monday he was still working to put together a team to organize the community engagement forums.","46-year-old Ramiro Armendariz was shot in the back as he walked towards his kitchen .

"Kugannesan Balasubramaniam, 31, (pictured outside court) allegedly ploughed his Peugeot into the back of Nick Sennett's 1963 MGB convertible roadster on the A40 Westway in London last April . A short-sighted taxi driver who became frustrated in rush-hour traffic rammed into the back of a classic car so hard it folded like a pen-knife, killing the driver, a court heard. Kugannesan Balasubramaniam, 31, is accused of ploughing his Peugeot people carrier into the back of the 1963 MGB convertible roadster at 48mph on the A40 Westway, near Paddington in London. Nick Sennett, 58, who had hired the classic car for a few days, suffered serious head injuries when his car was shunted forward violently in the crash on April 16 last year. He was knocked unconscious and paramedics spent an hour trying to save him, but the economics teacher was pronounced dead at the scene. Balasubramaniam, of Wembley, northwest London, denies one charge of causing death by dangerous driving and is currently on trial at Southwark Crown Court. The court heard how the minicab driver had just collected a sixth-form student from Heathrow Airport and was taking her to an address in northwest London when the collision occurred. Prosecutor Nicholas Bleaney told the court yesterday: 'Shortly before the collision she noticed the defendant making a mobile phone call. 'She thinks the phone was put to his ear rather than using a hands-free system but perhaps more importantly she started to pay attention to what was going on in front of her. 'She noticed that the traffic was building up and first thing in the morning it is by no means unusual for the traffic to build up. 'She noticed this defendant was starting to get frustrated and slapping the steering wheel with his hands. 'She then noticed the line of traffic in front of their car and it wasn't clear to her whether it was completely stationary or moving slowly, but she noticed around that point that the defendant started to speed up to a speed that would be appropriate to an empty road. 'She simply watched as the defendant drove into a car in front. 'That proved to be Mr Sennett's MGB, he had hired it from a classic car club for a few days and the impact shunted it into the car in front.' Mr Sennett, 53, an economics teacher at Latymer Upper School in Hammersmith, suffered serious head injuries in the crash after the classic car 'folded like a pen-knife'. He was pronounced dead at the scene . Mr Sennett was driving a 1963 MGB convertible roadster (similar to the one above) when the crash occurred . The force of Balasubramaniam's ramming also shunted cars ahead of the MGB, causing a four-car crash in total, jurors heard. 'Essentially it [the MGB] folded like a pen-knife,' said Mr Bleaney. 'He hit his head on the windscreen and suffered some chest injuries but the main injury was a very serious head injury and sadly he did not regain consciousness and he was pronounced dead at the scene.' The court heard how Balasubramaniam told officers at the scene that the vintage car had pulled suddenly in front of him, into his braking distance. Mr Bleaney said: 'It is the prosecution's case that is simply a lie and coupled with evidence from a number of sources shows that the driving of the defendant fell far below the standard of the ordinary, competent, careful driver and was therefore dangerous. 'It is the prosecution's case that far from moving into the defendant's path, Mr Sennett and the MG had been there all the time and was there to be seen and should have been seen and the defendant should have stopped behind him in the normal way.' Southwark Crown Court heard the incident occurred in rush-hour traffic on the A40 near Paddington, London, on April 16 last year (file picture) Balasubramaniam had been driving a replacement vehicle while his own car was at the garage, it was said. A tracking device inside the vehicle recorded the minicab driver was speeding at 48mph on the 40mph road, jurors heard. The court also heard how he was overworked, having worked 90 hours in the previous seven days for the cab hire company One to One. 'It is the prosecution's case that he was over-tired when he was driving and over-tired in circumstances where he had gone into that situation for commercial gain,' Mr Bleaney said. The short-sighted driver also failed a basic numberplate-reading eye test when officers attended the scene, the court heard. Mr Bleaney added: 'It is the prosecution's case that notwithstanding everything else, he was driving that day with inadequate eye sight.' Heartfelt tributes were paid to Mr Sennett, who taught at Latymer Upper School in Hammersmith, west London, following his death. In a letter to parents, the school's headmaster David Goodhew said: 'In the coming weeks, colleagues and students will give thought to how they wish to commemorate this much-valued teacher and friend.' He added: 'It is clear he touched the lives of so many and is remembered with tremendous warmth and affection. The school has lost a great teacher, a dear tutor and a good friend.' Chef Heston Blumenthal, who attended the £15,700-a-year school, also paid tribute to Mr Sennett. Following his death, he told the Evening Standard: 'What made Nick stand out was his very calm, playful banter. 'He was one of those teachers you could be very comfortable around. He was really lovable, really funny, chilled out.' Mr Sennett,  lived in Chiswick and taught at the Hammersmith school for five years. As well as teaching economics, he was also a sixth form tutor, coached the year nine rowing team and ran the school’s Young Enterprise scheme, which helps pupils start their own businesses. Balasubramaniam denies a single charge of causing death by dangerous driving. The trial continues.

"A butcher leapt from a multi-storey car park after trying to behead his estranged wife two days after telling his sister that killing her was 'the only way out', an inquest heard today. Oliver Ruse, 37, left his wife Deborah, the mother of his four children, dead on her kitchen floor after attacking her with an axe, Suffolk Coroners Court heard. Police told an inquest they found his gold Land Rover Discovery parked at a car park in Bury St Edmunds and a black bag inside containing a hand axe smeared with his wife's blood. Oliver Ruse leapt from a multi-storey car park after trying to behead his estranged wife two days after telling his sister that killing her was 'the only way out', an inquest heard today . Ruse, 37, left his wife Deborah, the mother of his four children, dead on her kitchen floor after attacking her with an axe, Suffolk coroners court heard . The 39-year-old's body was later found at her rented cottage 14 miles away in the Suffolk village of Long Melford. Detective Inspector Eamonn Bridger told  Kevin McCarthy, eastern coroner for Suffolk,  that Zambian-born Deborah had suffered 'wounds to her head and neck'. Forensic tests found her blood on the axe and her husband's DNA on the handle. Her blood was also found on his clothes. DI Bridger told the hearing in Ipswich, Suffolk the pair had separated in 2013 but remained on good terms for the sake of their four daughters, aged eight, 11, 12 and 16. He said Deborah had suffered from 'alcohol problems' and had returned to the village after 'several months' away. He added that Mr Ruse had been suffering from mental health issues shortly before the double deaths on November 13. He said he had 'thoughts of suicide' and stayed overnight at a local mental health unit based at West Suffolk Hospital in Bury St Edmunds - on November 5. The family butcher then had 'ongoing contact with the Crisis at Home team' and on November 11 revealed to family he had thought about killing his wife. DI Bridge added: 'He made comments to his sister. He said the only way out was if he killed Deborah but he said he couldn't live with this.' Two days later after spending the morning working as normal at his butcher's shop in Long Melford, he launched the attack, the inquest was told. CCTV footage showed him driving away from his business around 11.36am. Other footage showed showed his wife going to a local shop to buy two bottles of wine and some cigarettes. Mr Ruse was then filmed driving into a car park in Bury St Edmunds in his gold Land Rover just before midday. DI Bridge said: 'Paramedics were called to treat him for his injuries but he died at the scene. 'A gold Land Rover discovery vehicle was found. That vehicle was registered to Ruse and Sons Butchers. Two days later he carried out his horrific threat after spending the morning working as normal at his butcher's shop in Long Melford, the inquest was told . 'Within the vehicle they found a black bag containing a hand axe covered in blood. That raised concerns over other family members.' 'At 2.35pm they found the dead body of Deborah in the kitchen at [her address]' A post mortem by Dr Nat Carey on November 15 found Mr Ruse died of severe internal and external injuries, including wounds to her head and neck. Police are still awaiting the full results of her post mortem. The inquest heard how Mr Ruse was raised in Suffolk and met Deborah while she was studying at the University of Buckingham. They married in 1998 and had four daughters before moving to Long Melford, Suffolk. DI Bridger said the pair 'separated as a result of their differences' in 2013. He said: 'Deborah was suffering from alcohol problems and the relationship remained acrimonious up until her death.' DI Bridger added that 'there was an ongoing dispute as to where the children were living up until their deaths'. Mr McCarthy said: 'On the basis of that evidence I formally open the inquest of Oliver Ruse and also the inquest is opened into Deborah Ruse's death.' Speaking to DI Bridger, he added: 'Please carry to the respective families my heartfelt condolences. 'Tragedies like this bring home to us all the complexities of relationships and the frailties of life.' The inquest was adjourned until February 26.

"These furry fashionistas give new meaning to the term 'doggy bag' as they model the latest in canine couture. The fashion line, which includes bags and harnesses, is the work of Miami-based model-turned-designer Kiki Hamann. Kiki started the range after looking for a bag for her Chihuahua - and failing to find anything sufficiently stylish or fashionable. The fashion line, including bags (above) harnesses and dresses, is the work of designer Kiki Hamann . The fancy harnesses can either be draped around the front or back depending on your pooch's preferred view . The Brazilian-born designer has engineered the bag to create a seat-like insert for the dog. The designs also feature cushioning and insulation to ensure that the pampered pups remain warm and comfy at all times. 'The dogs love it because they get carried around pretty much like the same feeling you would get when laying in a hammock,' Kiki says. 'They love the gravity of being held by the fabric,' she adds. According to the designer, each item begins with 'a personal vision' and is then sketched and handcrafted 'to bring the dream to life'.

"Four terrorists jailed for their part in a plot to blow up London's Tube and bus network two weeks after 7/7 have today lost an appeal against their convictions at the European Court of Human Rights. Muktar Said Ibrahim, Ramzi Mohammed and Yassin Omar claimed it was unfair they were denied access to lawyers during police questioning and statements they gave were subsequently used at trial. Ismail Abdurahman - who was convicted of assisting one of the  bombers - also claimed his trial was unfair as a statement he provided as a witness, rather than a suspect, was used against him. Failed appeal: Ramzi Mohammed, Muktar Said Ibrahim, Yassin Omar and Ismail Abdurahman (pictured top left to bottom right) all lost appeals against their convictions at the European Court of Human Rights . Plot: Four men were convicted of the attempted bombing, with the four men captured here on Transport for London CCTV.  Ismail Abdurahman - was convicted of assisting one of the suspected bombers . In 2007 the men were convicted of the botched 21/7 bombings in 2005, and mirroring the 7/7 attacks that killed 52, tried to detonate bombs on Tube trains and a bus but they did not explode. Human rights judges at the ECHR in Strasbourg found that no prejudice had been caused to the failed bombers' right to a fair trial as a result of the failure to provide access to a lawyer before and during their interviews or to provide access to a lawyer to Abdurahman during his initial police interview. All four men have three months to refer their appeal to the Grand Chamber of the ECHR for a final attempt to challenge their convictions. At the heart of the case was the question of delaying access to a lawyer during police questioning, which took place in the aftermath of the attempted suicide bombings. Ibrahim, Mohammed and Omar, who were born in 1978, 1981 and 1981 respectively, were temporarily refused legal assistance for police 'safety interviews' - conducted urgently for the purpose of protecting life - to be held. Caught: The men went on the run after the failed bombing and eight days later Muktar Said Ibrahim (left) and Ramzi Mohammed were found in London and forced to leave wearing only their underpants . Terror attack: Muktar Said Ibrahim tried to set off a homemade bomb on the top deck of a bus but instead of exploding the explosive mixture started 'oozing' out of the sides and he dumped it and fled . Horrifying: During the 2007 trial Scotland Yard showed explosive power of devices that failed to explode in the July 21 attacks on London . The terrorists' statements during those interviews, denying any involvement in the events, were later admitted as evidence at their trial. Unlike the other applicants, Abdurahman was not suspected of detonating a bomb and was interviewed as a witness. He started to incriminate himself by explaining his encounter with one of the suspected bombers shortly after the attacks and the assistance he provided to that suspect. Rather than arrest him and advise him of his right to silence and to legal assistance, police continued to question him as a witness and took a written statement from him. He was subsequently offered legal advice and consistently referred to his written statement. This statement was subsequently admitted as evidence at his trial. Judges at the ECHR said: 'It has been convincingly established that at the time of the impugned police interviews there was an exceptionally serious and imminent threat to public safety and that this threat provided compelling reasons which justified the temporary delay of all four applicants' access to lawyers.' The planned attack came two weeks after the 7/7 bombers killed 52 people on three Tube trains and a bus in central London in 2005. The failed bombers claimed they took home-made explosives in rucksacks on to the Underground network as an elaborate hoax to protest against the war in Iraq. Ibrahim, Mohammed and Omar were convicted in July 2007 of conspiracy to murder and sentenced to a minimum term of 40 years imprisonment. The Court of Appeal subsequently refused leave to appeal against their conviction. Abdurahman was convicted in February 2008 of assisting one of the suspected bombers and of failing to disclose information about the bombings. He was sentenced to a total of 10 years imprisonment. His appeal against his conviction was dismissed in November 2008 and his sentence reduced to eight years imprisonment on account of the early assistance that he had given to the police.","Muktar Ibrahim, Ramzi Mohammed, Yassin Omar were failed 21/7 bombers .

"A heartwarming letter of support written by a nine-year-old to her primary school teacher has swept the internet. The British student wrote the tearjerker note after the teacher told her class that he was gay. The man, who has preferred to stay anonymous, told the website PinkNews that he decided to come out to his pupils after learning that all of the class had heard the word 'gay' used as an insult. The note that a British student wrote to her teacher after he told her class that he was gay. The man came out after learning every pupil had heard 'gay' used as an insult . He was stunned to receive the letter from the child afterwards, which described him as 'fantastic and awesome.' It read in full: 'Dear Mr R . 'Even though you're gay, I will always treat you the same way as I do now. 'I still think about you the same way as I used to. 'You're a great teacher and these are just some of the words that I would describe you as: great, amazing, fantastic, brilliant, awesome and brave. 'The reason why I say brave is because you shared a personal secret which was very brave. 'You don't have to feel scared because I know that everyone in the class feels the same way as I do. 'From A x x . 'PS. We are all proud of you' The teacher then shared the letter on social media. He told PinkNews: 'As a primary school teacher, I'd always worried about mentioning my sexuality, despite the fact that my colleagues talked about their husbands, wives and significant others all the time. 'Then, as part of anti-bullying week, I'd asked who'd heard 'gay' being used as an insult. Almost every one of my class put their hands up. I was stunned.' The teacher, who preferred to stay anonymous, said that he welled up after reading the letter (picture posed by models) He continued: 'Then I asked who thought that people who were gay or lesbian were bad or wrong in some way, again almost every hand went up. 'After speaking to my Head, who was very supportive, we agreed I could tell the class that I'm gay so they at least knew one gay person and hopefully explain that when people use that word they're talking about me.' 'The reaction was fantastic – there were a lot of gasps and shocked looks and some basic questions – do you have a boyfriend, etc – but after a couple of minutes they were over it and we moved on to the rest of the lesson. 'The letter came a couple of days later. The little girl who wrote it gave it to me at the start of the day with all the other slips about dinner money, school trips and doctors appointments. 'Reading it brought tears to my eyes and it took me a little while to compose myself. When I thanked her she just shrugged and repeated something one of the boys in the class had said during the lesson, 'It's just your life'. Then she went back to her maths. 'For my class it was a surprise sure but, to them, it was just something simple and easy to file away as another piece of information. There was no judgement, no follow-up, just acceptance. 'Now, I can mention my fiance as easily as any other teacher and my class know me a little better. I've had a lot of letters and cards over the years, but this one I know I'll keep forever.'","British student wrote the note after teacher told the class that he was gay .

"A doll with no facial features has been launched for Muslim children in line with Islamic rules about avoiding the depiction of faces. The featureless toy comes dressed in a hijab and red dress but has no eyes, nose or mouth. It has been designed to comply with strict Muslim teachings which rule against the representation of humans and animals in other forms, and specifically Muslim gods and their companions. An 'Islamic doll' with no facial features at all is being sold for £25 in line with Muslim rules which teach that items which represent features of living things, humans or animals, should not be produced and owned . However critics have dismissed the doll as 'foolish' and say it represents antiquated views of Islam teachings and fails to acknowledge that Muslim's are part of modern culture. The doll, which comes in just one design, is called Romeisa and named after the female companion of the Prophet Muhammad. It  is aimed at children living in strict Muslim families. 'There is an Islamic ruling which forbids the depiction of facial features of any kind and that includes pictures, sculptures and, in this case, dolls,' the designer, who is known as Ridhwana B, told the Lancashire Telegraph. 'I spoke to a religious scholar in Leicester who guided me through what was and what was not permissible when producing the product. 'The Deeni Doll has no face on it whatsoever and is Shariah compliant.' A lot of Islamic art, like this Ottoman ivory and turquoise-inlaid box, has geometric patterns rather than faces . The former teacher, who used to work at a Muslim school in Lancashire, said she came up with the idea to design the doll after speaking to parents who were concerned about toys with facial features. She said it took four years to design and added: 'The Islamic range in kids toys is quite limited at the moment with few choices. Although this project took a while, I am looking at researching other ideas in the future. 'I am looking at compiling a book for the Islamic upbringing of children in the future too.' However Professor Fawaz Gerges, a specialist in Muslim societies and politics at London School of Economics, said: 'This is silliness and foolishness. 'Muslims are now part of a global community . 'In early Islamic history imagery was not preferred for a variety of reasons. But the debate is, how far do you go now? Islam teaches aniconism - the practice of avoiding creating images of living things. The most absolute prohibition is images of God, followed by Islamic prophets and then relatives of Muhammad. However this teaching is extended to humans in the hadith, which is open to interprettion. This  has led to Islamic art being represented in geometric patterns and calligraphy. The Quran doesn't specifically prohibit depictions of humans, but it does rule against idolatry - the worship of an idol or physical object as a symbol of God. Sunni authorities interpret the hadith as prohibiting any representations of living things while others have a less strict approach that takes into account the variety of images available and used today. 'The overwhelming majority of Muslims are living 21st century lifestyles, things have not been frozen from the 6th century. 'There are some people who would like us to think Muslim history is frozen in time and space but it has evolved. Young Muslims are now globalised. 'The doll is a gimmick, an ultra-conservative interpretation. It is a very isolated phenomenon and with all due respect I imagine it would only appeal to a very tiny group. 'It's a cultural luxury and I don't think it will have much of an audience or many clients. ' Aniconism is taught in Islam, which rules against the creation of living beings. However interpretations of the teachings have evolved over time as more imagery is used in modern society, for example on television and in adverts. Today the avoidance of idolatry is the main concern for devout Muslims. It is hoped the doll will be able to be used by Muslim children who often face having to have their toys removed at night because teachings forbid anything with eyes being left in the room. The doll is being sold for £25 and although it is not the first of its kind in the world, it is thought to be the only one produced to such a high quality. Only a limited number have been made but Ridhwana said she has already had orders. It has been named after one of the female companions of Muhammad, who are known by the collective name Sahabiyat. The prophet had hundreds of companions who knew Muhammad and recited hadith, which were the basis of developing the Islamic tradition. Companions are loosely defined as anyone who saw the prophet Muhammad and died a Muslim. The idea of creating dolls for children to play with and learn from is based on stories that Prophet Muhammad's wife, Aisha, also played with the featureless items.","Featureless doll with no eyes, nose or lips produced for Muslim children .

"A student nurse was murdered and then skinned by her stepfather whom she was planning to accuse of sexually assaulting her, it emerged today. Kassandra Bravo was reported missing earlier this month after she failed to turn up to a baby-sitting job at a family friend's house. Police issued a missing person notice  after her mother raised the alarm and three days later her body was discovered lying in a ditch beside a road near the village of Las Cocinas in Mexico. Student nurse Kassandra Bravo was murdered, skinned and then dumped in a ditch allegedly by her stepfather whom she was about to accuse of sexually assaulting her over a four-your period . Bravo was reported missing after she failed to turn up to a baby-sitting job at a family friend's house . Detectives investigating the case said it had been impossible to identify the body as the missing teenager straight away because her face had been stripped of her skin. A post-mortem revealed that she had been strangled. A friend reportedly told police that Miss Bravo had been planning to tell her mother Angeles Bravo, 41, that her stepfather Daniel Murrieta Sainz, 42, had been sexually abusing her since the age of 15. Police spokesman Francis Zamora said: 'We brought him in for questioning and he admitted strangling her and dumping the body. 'But he denied he had been abusing her or that he had skinned her. Police issued a missing person notice after her mother raised the alarm and three days later her body was discovered lying in a ditch beside a road near the village of Las Cocinas in Mexico . 'He said he had been furious when he wanted to take her to her babysitting job and she had not been ready. 'After a row he had strangled her.' The young woman's horrific death in a region that is regularly shocked by brutal attacks on women has sparked an angry protest lead by Miss Bravo's friends. Campaigners are demanding more action to protect women from violence and justice for the teenager.","Kassandra Bravo went missing after failing to turn up to baby-sitting job .

"Wading through mountains of cans, bottles, televisions and computers, these are the migrant labourers forced to live and work in a Chinese rubbish tip. As the country's population boom shows no sign of abating and its rampant consumerism continues unchecked, China has established itself as the world's biggest generator of solid waste. Much of the rubbish created in Beijing is transported to the rubbish tip in Dong Xiao Kou, near Beijing, where a large community lives and thrives on salvaging what they can from the vast amount of waste.

At Dong Xiao Kou, also known as China's 'scrap village', labourers have become a critical part of the waste management system. Mostly consisting of migrant families, the labouring crews have flocked to the village from the surrounding provinces where they earn a living sorting through the waste and recycled goods. The work is often dirty and dangerous. Electronic waste, such as televisions, cameras, computers and cellphones carry unique hazards for those handling them. They contain metals and various chemical compounds - such as mercury, cadmium and chromium - that can pose a serious risk to people who come into repeated contact with them. While some chance their luck with electronics, other members of the community have branched out to specialise in recycling wood, cardboard or plastics.

"Delta Sigma Phi's Gamma Alpha chapter is now closed and will remain that way for at least two years, San Diego State University said Tuesday. The fraternity's 'consistent pattern of policy violations that includes the harassment of a Take Back the Night March on Friday, November 21, 2014, as well as other significant hazing and alcohol misconduct issues' was the reason behind the move, the university said in a release. Delta Sigma Phi's members brandished dildos at Take Back the Night demonstrators, student newspaper The Daily Aztec reported. Take Back the Night, whose events are frequently held on college campuses, says on its website 'We seek to end sexual assault, domestic violence, dating violence, sexual abuse and all other forms of sexual violence.' Behavior: Delta Sigma Phi members at San Diego State University reportedly brandished dildos at Take Back the Night demonstrators last month during an event . 'Delta Sigma Phi and SDSU have agreed that the earliest date for recolonization would be fall 2016. The return date is subject to a review of demonstrated adherence to university policies,' SDSU said in the release. The fraternity's national office said in a statement that 'It recently became clear that certain members of Gamma Alpha Chapter have not maintained the integrity that our members deserve and that our history demands. A series of incidents highlighted behavior inconsistent with the high standards that have been synonymous with the Delta Sigma Phi Fraternity at San Diego State University.' It continued, 'After learning of widespread member misconduct issues, the National Fraternity determined it was not in the best interest of Delta Sigma Phi to continue operating Gamma Alpha Chapter. The Fraternity cannot, and will not, tolerate blatant disregard toward our policies and standards for members and chapters.' SDSU said in its release that the 'individuals involved in the harassment policy violation will be subject to a Title IX policy investigation and a student code of conduct policy violation investigation.' Plan: SDSU announced Monday an education plan for fraternities and sororities, which included an online course and a Walk a Mile in Her Shoes event scheduled for the spring semester . In an email exchange with MailOnline, university spokesman Greg Block emphasized that 'Delta Sigma Phi was not closed on our campus because of [the Take Back the Night event]. That incident was the last in a string of policy violations that led the Delta Sigma Phi national office to close the chapter here at San Diego State.' The Daily Aztec reported earlier this month that both Delta Sigma Phi and Sigma Phi Epsilon were interviewed by Student Life and Leadership over the Take Back the Night event, with plans to interview the demonstrators. Block told The Daily Aztec on Tuesday that an investigation continues into allegations that Sigma Phi Epsilon members hollered obscenities at Take Back the Night demonstrators. Concerned Students of San Diego State University alleged in a statement that 'Specifically, on Hardy Avenue, men at the SIGMA PHI EPSILON fraternity house yelled obscenities at the marchers.' Last week, Sigma Phi Epsilon's chapter president Austin Dean told The College Fix that the demonstrators shouted obscenities at multiple fraternities. 'When they arrived at our campus facility and began yelling, a single member of our chapter shouted for them to go home,' he told the website. 'We are continuing to investigate whether anything that was said by this student was inappropriate, but have been unable to substantiate this claim,' Dean also said. The Daily Aztec reported that 'The InterFraternity Council suspended social activities on [November] 25 following the allegations from demonstrators in an effort to educate its members about sexual assault.' SDSU announced Monday an education plan for fraternities and sororities, which included an online course and a Walk a Mile in Her Shoes event scheduled for the spring semester.","Delta Sigma Phi's Gamma Alpha chapter is now closed and will remain that way for at least two years, San Diego State University said Tuesday .

"Dr Niaz Ahmed has been convicted of sexually assaulting two of his colleagues at South Tyneside Hospital and has been told he may be jailed . An anaesthetist who was branded 'the octopus' for his wandering hands and lewd comments could be jailed for groping nurses at the hospital where he worked. Dr Niaz Ahmed passed off his behaviour as innocent banter and was referred to as a 'sex pest' by prosecutors at Newcastle Crown Court. The skilled doctor, who had received numerous warnings from hospital bosses to tone down his behaviour, was convicted of sexually assaulting two of his colleagues more than a decade ago and must now sign the sex offenders register. Ahmed, who was suspended from medical practice at a tribunal earlier this year for groping a nurse who was treating him after an accident in 2010, was cleared of three similar charges. Michael Hodson, prosecuting, said: 'Imagine what it was like going to work with a sex pest, always the octopus, hands all over the place, underlined by innuendo.' Mr Hodson said one nurse victim was targeted in the scrub room at the hospital, where Ahmed squeezed her bottom and asked her 'do you fancy it'. Another had her breasts prodded by the medic while she was at work and said he had told her 'put them away'. The 55-year-old doctor had previously told bosses at South Tyneside Hospital that his behaviour was in keeping with 'the culture' at the hospital. The court heard during a meeting with hospital bosses in 2000 Ahmed accepted it was inappropriate to touch nurses and said any offence caused by him was entirely innocent and accidental. During a later meeting with management he said his behaviour continued to be innocent. Ahmed, of Cleadon, had claimed he was the victim of a 'witch hunt' in 2012 after he was cleared of sexually assaulting two teenage girls at a fireworks display in South Shields in 2011. The youngsters claimed Ahmed had groped them after boasting about the size of his manhood and complaining about his sex life with his wife. Bradford Crown Court heard Ahmed was branded 'the octopus' because of his lewd behaviour and comments . He had reportedly said he was 'looking for women the day after he got married.' He will be sentenced next month and Judge Simon Hickey warned him that 'all options remained open', including a jail sentence. Ahmed was bailed until the sentencing hearing.","Dr Niad Ahmed sexually assaulted 2 nurses at South Tyneside Hospital .

"The wife of one of Britain's biggest buy-to-let tycoons has been ordered to pay more than £3,000 in overdue council tax on nine of their estimated 1,000 properties. Judith Wilson, 64, was due to attend court but failed to turn up after her millionaire husband Fergus asked to change the date. The 66 year-old - who usually represents his wife - made the request because he was filming a forthcoming episode of Panorama about his empire. Judith Wilson, pictured with her millionaire husband Fergus, was charged with not paying council tax on nine of the couple's properties . His wife is charged with ten counts of not paying council tax for nine homes which are part of the couple's portfolio. Magistrates in Maidstone, Kent heard that the local borough council had contacted her number of times to pay up. Carole Stevenson, court officer for Mid Kent Revenues and Benefits Partnership, requested that 10 liability orders demanding payment be sent to Mrs Wilson in relation to nine properties in the Maidstone area. The request was approved by the court with a total of £3,288 to be paid, including a £60 summons fee and £500 in costs. But Mr Wilson had protested it was not their responsibility to pay. He disputed claims by Maidstone Borough Council that the properties were unoccupied for more than one month and is now planning to appeal. The businessman is ranked 453 on The Sunday Times 'Rich List' with a fortune of £180 million and nearly 1,000 properties. Speaking after the court case, former professional boxer Mr Wilson said: 'I plan to appeal these orders on the basis that the forms I was sent were impossible to understand and that Maidstone Borough Council said the properties were unoccupied for more than one month which is not the case. As of last year Wilson and his wife, from Maidstone are thought to have owned nearly 1,000 two and three-bedroom properties around Ashford, Folkestone and Maidstone . 'I have had a number of issues with the authority regarding my properties and now I no longer take tenants who are called Wilson, which is the third most common surname in the UK, as there are many instances of me and my wife being asked to pay amounts which those tenants owe. 'I have invested £100million in property in Ashford but not Maidstone simply because I have faced so many problems in the area. 'Business is all about getting along with people and that is the problem with the council. They do not get on with me and as a result there are many single mothers in the borough who need housing but have to stay in bed and breakfasts. 'I wanted to be in court to dispute the charges but unfortunately the reality is I'm a busy man and had important filming to do. I can't be in two places at once.' He added that he is keen for legislation to be passed that requires land lords to collect council tax from tenants and that he's sure the council are too as this will no doubt stop issues in future. As of last year Mr Wilson and his wife, from Maidstone are believed to have owned nearly 1,000 two and three-bedroom properties around Ashford, Folkestone and Maidstone. In August 2009, Judith Wilson had her court case thrown out by the judge. She had demanded £3,000 for a new bathroom suite from a tenant who had damaged a cistern lid despite the tenant offering to replace the lid. A judge branded the claim 'exaggerated', and said he 'had doubts' that work to replace the bathroom suite would ever be carried out. In January 2014 her husband sent around 200 eviction notices to every tenant getting housing benefit, claiming he had lost around £800,000 because of them. He told letting agents that he would no longer accept tenants who required housing benefit. And in April last year he was found guilty of attacking an estate agent over a dispute over a boiler in one of his homes. Mr Wilson has said previously he planned to sell his empire and wanted to retire so he could write children's books. A spokesman for Maidstone Borough Council said: 'Due to the Data Protection Act we cannot go into details about individual cases. However, there are circumstances where an owner of a rental property might be responsible for council tax arrears such as when the property is empty.'","Judith Wilson, 64, was charged with ten counts of not paying council tax .

"The founder of the El Torito restaurant chain who helped popularize guacamole, fajitas and margaritas with the U.S. masses, has died at age 90. Larry J. Cano died of pancreatic cancer Wednesday at his home in Corona Del Mar. Cano, who served as a fighter pilot during World War II, took over a closed-down Polynesian restaurant in Los Angeles in 1954 and turned it into the first El Torito. Larry J. Cano, the founder of the El Torito restaurant chain,  has died of pancreatic cancer . The El Torito restaurant chain helped popularize Mexican dishes including guacamole, fajitas and margaritas in the U.S. He served a mild version of Mexican food that was friendly to mid-century American tastes at a time when there was a burgeoning hunger for the cuisine. Cano said a more authentic cuisine might have scared off many American diners when he was starting out. 'You have to do what you have to do,' he told the OC Weekly newspaper in 2011. 'It would be ridiculous to have spicy food for the first time someone tries Mexican food and kill them.' Cano expanded the restaurant to 22 locations by the time he sold the chain in 1978 to New York-based W.R. Grace & Co. He stayed on as president, overseeing the opening of nearly 200 outlets by his 1988 retirement. Fajitas and blended margaritas are among the dishes and drinks he made common in the U.S. 'He was iconic,' Don Myers, owner of Cha Cha's Latin Kitchen in Brea who worked with Cano in his early days, told the Orange County Register. The newspaper first reported Cano's death. 'He was Colonel Sanders as far as I'm concerned.' Cano's said his success was down to selecting mild Mexican dishes and a more spicy cuisine might have scared off many American diners when he was starting out in the 1950s .","Larry J.

"People with concerns about Britain's booming population should ask themselves if they would be bothered if it was fuelled by a surge in white Anglo Saxon protestant babies, the Mayor of London has said. Boris Johnson called for a 'proper conversation' about how many people live in the UK and how far voters would be prepared to go to reduce the numbers.

He added: 'All I'm saying to people is there is a trade-off and if you go for a reduction there will be an economic price to pay.'

"Barbara Harris (pictured) is head of the equality and diversity team at Brighton and Sussex University Hospitals NHS Trust which drew up the guidelines . Bosses at an NHS trust have  issued a bizarre list of guidelines to stop anyone at their Christmas party facing  discrimination. The equality and diversity team at Brighton and Sussex University Hospitals NHS Trust assembled the list of discriminatory party pitfalls which include catering food for all religious, cultural and disability requirements. Their leaked Equality Bulletin seems to indicate that office parties in the NHS are viewed as a  minefield of political correctness. The extraordinary briefing told party organisers that 'there could be the potential for claims of sexual discrimination' if they did not ensure that the bash was scheduled for a time and location where women with 'caring responsibilities' would be able to attend. It also warned staff that the staple of office parties - enjoying a few Christmas drinks - could also be deemed discriminatory because people under 18 would not be able to join in. 'If the venue is on licensed premises, there is the potential for age discrimination. Think about how this difficulty could be overcome. If there is no age restriction on the venue, remind under 18s they should not be drinking alcohol.' The food on offer is also highlighted as a potential pitfall, with the authors stating: 'You need to cater for the needs of everyone attending the event to avoid discrimination. Consider the religious and cultural requirements and possible adjustments for disabled employees.' Managers were also told they should carry out 'a full risk assessment of possible risks before the party/event. This will serve to both reduce the risk of any accidents, and also assist in defending any claims should they happen.' It was drawn up by the equality and diversity team at Brighton and Sussex University Hospitals NHS Trust. The head of the team is Barbara Harris - referred to in the briefing as 'Babs' - who earns a £50,854 a year salary overseeing the hospital's equality programme. Last year the trust announced it would have to make £30m of cuts. Jonathan Isaby, Chief Executive of the Taxpayers' Alliance, today blasted the document as a 'total waste of money.' The guidelines from the Trust, which runs The Royal County Sussex Hospital, have been ridiculed as a 'total waste of time... and money' He said: 'When we're trying to make savings, having an employee write up commonsense rules for having fun at a Christmas party seems like a total waste of time, effort, and taxpayers' money. 'The cost of the Nanny State continues to be placed on the back of hard-working ordinary people.' The briefing's authors urge party organisers to choose a date which does not clash with other staff's religious festivals or requirements, stating: 'It is important to enjoy yourself, but the Trust's Dignity At Work Policy should be observed.' It also warns employees against calling in sick the next day with a hangover, stating: 'Absence from work following Christmas parties/events - it is worth remembering, unless there is a valid reason for absences, i.e a genuine illness, unforeseen emergency (for example breakdown in care arrangements or household), it will be considered an unauthorised absence and may lead to disciplinary action being taken.' Finally, it lists contact details for three companies providing interpreting services, as well as an out-of-hours contact for an organisation specialising in sign language and lip-reading for the deaf. The Trust issued the ten guidelines to ensure no-one was at risk of discrimination at their Christmas party. 1. Employees are reminded: ‘It is important to enjoy yourself, but the Trust’s Dignity At Work Policy should be observed.’ Organisers should remember that not all staff celebrate Christmas, so it is vital to make sure parties don’t clash with other, non-Christian religious festivals. 2. ‘There could be the potential for claims for sex discrimination.’ Women with ‘caring responsibilities’ should not be excluded. Nor should any staff currently on maternity or paternity leave. 3. Agency workers should also have access to the party. 4. ‘If the venue is on licensed premises, there is the potential for age discrimination. Think about how this difficulty could be overcome. If there is no age restriction on the venue, remind under 18’s they should not be drinking alcohol.’ 5. ‘By choosing a venue that does not enable access, could potentially be cause for disability discrimination (remember disability covers more than just physical access, toilets, etc). Disabled employees must not be treated less favourably than non-disabled employees.’ 6. Party planners must remember they have a ‘duty of care’ towards those who attend. Make sure there are designated drivers and keep the number of a local taxi firm handy in case someone is too drunk to drive home. 7.  ‘Absence from work following Christmas parties/events — it is worth remembering, unless there is a valid reason for absences, i.e. a genuine illness, unforeseen emergency (for example breakdown in care arrangements or household), it will be considered an unauthorised absence and may lead to disciplinary action being taken.’ 8. ‘Managers . . . should carry out a full assessment of possible risks before the party/event. This will serve to both reduce the risk of any accidents, and also assist in defending any claims should they happen.’ 9.‘You need to cater for the needs of everyone attending the event to avoid discrimination. Consider the religious and cultural requirements and possible adjustments for disabled employees.’ 10. Emergency numbers are listed for three companies providing interpreting services, plus an out-of-hours contact for an organisation specialising in sign language and lip-reading for the deaf.","List warns drinking alcohol could discriminate against staff aged under 18 .

"Abu Al-Libi was nabbed in Tripoli in October 2013 and brought to the United States to face trial in the 1998 bombings of U.S. embassies in Africa that killed 224 people . Prosecutors want a judge presiding over a terrorism trial to let them show jurors letters recovered in the raid that killed Osama bin Laden to boost evidence against a man snatched off the streets of Libya last year. In papers in Manhattan federal court, prosecutors asked U.S. District Judge Lewis A. Kaplan to permit the 'critically important evidence' against Abu Anas al-Libi. Al-Libi was nabbed in Tripoli in October 2013 and brought to the United States to face trial in the 1998 bombings of U.S. embassies in Africa that killed 224 people. He has pleaded not guilty in the attacks, which killed a dozen Americans. The government wants to show jurors six letters dated between June 2010 and April 2011 and recovered from bin Laden's Abbottabad, Pakistan compound, where he was killed May 2, 2011, by a special operations team. Al-Libi's lawyer did not immediately return a message seeking comment. Prosecutors said the letters, including two written by al-Libi, prove he actively participated in al-Qaida after eight years incarcerated in Iran. They said the letters would provide a Jan. 12 trial with 'powerful, direct, proof of al-Qaida's conspiracies to bomb and kill Americans, as well as Anas al-Libi's knowing and intentional participation in them.' 'Indeed, one can scarcely conceive of more powerful uncharged-acts proof than recent correspondence among bin Laden, his chief deputy, and the defendant about the defendant's continued participation in al-Qaida,' prosecutors said in papers filed Friday. The government wants to show jurors six letters dated between June 2010 and April 2011 and recovered from bin Laden's Abbottabad, Pakistan compound, where he was killed May 2, 2011, by a special operations team . In one 2010 letter to bin Laden, al-Libi asks 'God to reunite me with you soon under the banner of Islam and the Islamic state and the banner of jihad,' the government said. The government also wants to show jurors four letters to bin Laden from his chief deputy discussing al-Libi's continued participation in al-Qaida, prosecutors said. In an Oct. 13, 2010, letter written by al-Libi, he responds to a bin Laden request that he describe his flight from Afghanistan to Iran in late 2001 or early 2002 and his release from Iranian detention and his return to Pakistan in 2010, prosecutors said. Prosecutors said al-Libi told bin Laden he worried about him throughout his incarceration. 'You may know the place you hold in my heart and so I ask Allah to bring us together,' al-Libi was quoted by the government as saying. Prosecutors said al-Libi then asked bin Laden for 'a reward for you and I' from 'Allah' that 'will lead us, you and I, in the end, to martyrdom in his (Allah's) sake' Prosecutors said al-Libi confessed to U.S. investigators he joined al-Qaida in 1989, receiving training in security, bomb-making, intelligence collection and passport forgery, and had been involved with al-Qaida security, including a stint as bin Laden's chief personal bodyguard. Prosecutors noted al-Libi has repeatedly claimed his intent was to fight Libya's former leader and not to kill Americans. They said the letters more than a decade after the embassy bombings provided ""powerful proof of the defendant's culpable participation in the bin Laden-led conspiracies during the charged period.""","In papers in Manhattan federal court, prosecutors asked U.S. District Judge Lewis A.

"The fuel price war is driving the cost of petrol back towards 99p a litre, experts said yesterday as the Big Four supermarkets announced another price cut. Asda once again led the charge by slashing a further 2p off the price of unleaded and 1p off the price of diesel across its UK forecourts, with Morrisons, Sainsbury’s and Tesco swiftly following suit. The cuts mean Asda customers will pay no more than 110.7p a litre for petrol, with the company's diesel costing 117.7p a litre. On September 28, Asda’s petrol price was as high as 126.7p a litre, with diesel at 129.7p a litre. Slashed: Supermarket giant Asda has sparked a new round of price cuts at the pumps by slashing another 2p off the price of its petrol . With the price of crude oil plummeting – it has fallen to below $60 a barrel this week – the RAC said it was ‘optimistic’ that petrol could dip below £1 a litre in the new year. This would take prices at the pumps to their lowest level since the end of May 2009 when the average price was 99.9p. Fuel price-trackers Experian Catalist said that on Tuesday, before the latest price drops, unleaded was selling at an average UK price of 116.32p per litre – compared with a high of 141.48p in April 2012. Diesel was at 122.16p. Motorists have already seen £1 knocked off the average price of a fill-up after prices plummeted by more than 2p over the weekend. The RAC predicted that within the next fortnight, average UK petrol prices would fall to below 110p a litre and diesel to under 116p. RAC fuel spokesman Simon Williams said: ‘We have every reason to think petrol at under £1 early in 2015 is a very real prospect. ‘The cost of visiting family and friends this Christmas will be the cheapest it’s been for nearly five years, but the prospect of petrol going below £1 a litre in the new year is incredible, particularly when prices at the beginning of 2014 seemed to be heading ever upwards.’ The RAC said motorists have become so used to high petrol prices that many had forgotten that they had ever been less than £1 a litre. The RAC said in a report that it was ‘optimistic’ that petrol prices could fall below £1 a litre because the price of Brent crude has fallen below the $60-a-barrel mark for the first time since early July 2009. Going down: The price of Brent crude has fallen below the $60 (£38)-a-barrel mark for the first time since early July 2009. Pictured above is a pump jack at sunrise near Bakersfield, California . It is predicted to ‘keep on dropping’ after the Arab-dominated oil cartel OPEC – the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries – indicated that it will not cut production ‘even if oil hits $40 a barrel’. The RAC added: ‘In July 2009 the average price of unleaded was 103.09p a litre and diesel 104.22p, due to the slightly stronger pound which affects pump prices as fuel is traded in dollars. 'The pound is currently a little weaker than it was then at $1.57. There is a very good chance forecourt prices will continue to fall as the price of a barrel of crude goes lower.’ Asda’s petrol trading director, Andy Peake, said: ‘We’re giving drivers an early Christmas present as fuel prices continue to fall. It is our 11th price cut since September.’ Morrisons’ petrol director, Mark Todd, said: ‘Recent wholesale price drops have allowed us to pass savings on to the customer.’ Diesel is 15.91p cheaper – 122.33p a litre now compared to 138.24p in January. On Monday, the average supermarket price of fuel was 114.26p for petrol and 120.18p for diesel. He said: 'Current forecasts are for average petrol prices to fall to below 110p a litre in the next fortnight and diesel to drop to under 116p. 'At these average prices across the country the cheapest retailers will almost certainly be selling petrol for around 105p a litre, or even lower.'","RAC predicts petrol prices will fall to below £1.10 within next fortnight .

"They're notoriously shy, but a photographer had these woodland squirrels eating almost from the palm of his hand after he set up a 'studio' in his icy back garden. Geert Weggen equipped his home in the Swedish village of Bispgarden with camera equipment, lighting and wintery backdrops, including plinths covered in ice, red berries and pine cones. The Dutch-born 46-year-old, who works as a carpenter, then enticed the animals using seeds and nuts - resulting in these spectacular images. 'Animals will do almost anything for food and every animal will get used to a human in time,' he said. 'They will come very close or even touch me as long as I respect their boundaries.

"David Cameron will 'never ever' go into coalition with Ukip, Downing Street aides have revealed. The Prime Minister is facing an uphill battle to win enough seats at the next election to form a majority Conservative government, according to the latest polls. But Mr Cameron would rather form a minority Tory government in the Commons than make a deal with Nigel Farage, it has been claimed. David Cameron will 'never, ever' form a coalition with the UKIP, a Downing Street aide has revealed . Senior Tories are said to be 'increasingly convinced' that Mr Cameron will choose to govern alone if the Tories are the biggest party in the Commons but do not have enough MPs to form an overall majority. Mr Cameron is growing frustrated with the number of Coalition rows between Tory and Lib Dem ministers. Allies of the Prime Minister say he is no longer minded to make a 'bold and generous offer' to Nick Clegg in the event of another hung Parliament. Mr Cameron will consider forming an alliance with a rump of unionist Northern Ireland MPs, but he has completely ruled out doing a deal with Ukip. A Downing Street aide told the Times that Mr Cameron will 'never, ever' form a coalition with Ukip. 'A minority administration would be preferable to another coalition,' one insider told the newspaper. Ukip are thought targeting up to 25 seats at the next election – which could see them challenge the Lib Dems and the Scottish Nationalists to be the third largest party in the Commons. According to the latest opinion polling the Tories and Labour are neck and neck on 32 per cent - with the Lib Dems on just 7 per cent. Ukip are on 16 per cent and the Greens on 7 per cent. Nigel Farage has previously said Ukip could prop up a minority Conservative government if the Tories agreed to a swift and fair referendum on Britain's membership of the European Union. Nigel Farage has previously said Ukip could prop up a minority Conservative government if the Tories agreed to a swift and fair referendum . The Ukip leader accused David Cameron of trying to kick the national vote, planned for 2017 if the Tories win outright next May, 'into the long grass'. But the eurosceptic party would agree to a confidence and supply arrangement - where it backs or abstains on budget and legislative programme votes - with a minority Conservative government in return for a quick and full referendum. Mr Farage said: 'The price would be a full, free and fair referendum on our continued membership of the European Union, the opportunity to get our country back, and for that to happen quickly.

"Scientists have long warned of the dangers of eating foods high on the glycaemic index amid fears they increase a person's risk of heart disease and diabetes. But a new study has revealed evidence to the contrary - debunking the GI diet for those who are healthy. The glycaemic index is a measure of how quickly foods containing carbohydrates, such as fruits, cereals and baked goods, raise glucose levels in the bloodstream. Those that cause a sharp spike in blood sugar levels over a two-hour period are said to have a high glycaemic index. While those that don't cause the big rise have a low glycaemic index. Conventional wisdom says that high glycaemic index foods like bananas and pasta are 'bad' for heart health and may increase the risk of developing diabetes. A new study by researchers at Harvard School of Medicine and John Hopkins University of Medicine has found little evidence that foods high on the glycaemic index are 'bad' for your heart health and increase a person's risk of diabetes. The GI measures how quickly carbohydrates raise blood sugar levels . But the new study, carried out by scientists at the Johns Hopkins University of Medicine and Harvard School of Medicine in Boston, claims to have found little evidence to support these claims. Professor of medicine at John Hopkins Medicine, Lawrence Appel, said the results 'surprised' the team. 'We did not detect any clear benefits of the low glycaemic index diets on the major risk factors for heart disease, and we found no evidence of benefit for diabetes prevention,' he said. He added: 'The evidence has been inconsistent that low glycaemic foods help people lose more weight or keep it off. 'In looking at the causes of obesity and ways to control it, a narrow focus on the glycaemic index seems to be unwarranted.' Several popular diets encourage choosing low GI carbohydrates, which has led to calls to put the glycaemic index value of foods on packaging. But the researchers warn only laboratory tests can establish a food's GI rating, and the results can be unexpected, for example apples score low but cantaloupe melons score high. The scientists' aim was to determine if foods' glycaemic index influences a person's heart health and risk of diabetes. Professor Appel and study co-director Professor of medicine at Harvard, Frank Sacks, recruited 163 volunteers from Baltimore and Boston, all of whom were overweight and had above normal blood pressure. They randomly assigned them to follow one of four diets. Low GI foods . New potatoes . Spaghetti . Brown rice . Sweet potatoes . Instant noodles . Wholewheat bread . Hummus . Sponge cake . Lentils . Chick peas . Frozen green peas . Tomatoes . Onions . Apples . Medium GI foods . Croissant . White pita bread . Wholemeal rye . Honey . Digestives . Blueberry muffin . Ice cream . Mango . Bananas . Beetroot . Basmati rice . Cous cous . Gnocchi . Baked potatoes . High GI foods . Instant white rice . French fries . Mashed potato . Tapioca . Short grain white rice . White bread . Bagel . French baguette . Scones . Rice cakes . Parsnips . Pumpkin . Watermelon . Dates . Each diet contained the same number of calories, but those calories came from foods that were either high or low in carbohydrates, and high or low on the GI scale. The volunteers ate their main meal with researchers, and took home their next two meals. After five weeks on their assigned diets, they were switched to a different one. 'A higher glycaemic diet would have more bananas and instant oatmeal,' said Professor Sacks. 'A lower glycaemic index would have more dried apricots and steel cut oats.' The scientists tested the volunteers' blood pressure, sensitivity to insulin, and levels of 'good' high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, 'bad' low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and triglycerides - fat molecules in the blood stream that play a role in heart health. The results revealed the low GI diets did not lower blood pressure or LDL cholesterol, and did not improve insulin resistance. They showed little difference between high and low glycaemic index foods, the authors said. Professor Sacks said it is likely people's bodies can handle variations in food on the GI index, even if they are overweight and are already having problems with insulin resistance. He said: 'I guess it just works normally in most people,' adding the glycaemic index should be studied among people with type 2 diabetes, which is also commonly known as adult-onset diabetes. Women made up 51 per cent of the study's volunteers, and African-Americans made up 52 per cent, so the results have broad relevance, Professor Appel said. He advised: 'Get back to the basics that most people already know. 'Don't drink sugar-sweetened drinks. Try to eat fruits, vegetables and whole grains. Try to avoid sweets, salt and foods high in saturated and trans fats. 'People who follow these principles will reap the benefits.' The scientists' aim was to determine if foods' glycaemic index influences a person's heart health and risk of diabetes.  Apples are said to be low GI while bananas are higher on the index . Professor Sacks said existing studies suggest there may be a benefit for people with diabetes, but there needs to be more research. Dr Robert Eckel, who wrote an editorial accompanying the new study, said the study's message is that the glycaemic index is not that important if a diet is already heart healthy. 'If you're eating a heart-healthy diet, glycaemic index is not important to consider,' said Dr Eckel, a past president of the American Heart Association and a professor at the University of Colorado. ''I think the emphasis needs to be on the overall diet pattern,' he said. Professor Sacks said people who want a good overall diet should look toward Mediterranean-style diets or the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet, which emphasizes vegetables, fruits, fat-free dairy, whole grains, fish, poultry, nuts and vegetable oils. The study was published in the Journal of the American Medical Association.","Glycaemic index is a measure of how quickly foods containing carbohydrates raise blood sugar levels in the bloodstream .

"For the first time in three decades, the nation's most common sexually transmitted disease is on the decline. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced on Tuesday that the rate and number of chlamydia (pronounced kluh-MID'-ee-uh) cases fell by 1.5per cent in 2013. But there were still 1.4 million new cases reported - more than any other sexually transmitted disease. Experts are not sure what to make of the one-year drop. On the decline: The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced on Tuesday that the rate and number of chlamydia cases fell last year by 1.5per cent (stock photo) The rate in women decreased by 2.4per cent, while the rate in men increased by 0.8per cent. The drop in cases follows a spike over the previous four years; the  report stated that between 2009 and 2013, the chlamydia rate in men increased 21per cent, compared with a 6.2per cent increase in women during the same four-year period. The disease's prevalence also varied by racial and ethnic minority populations. For example, in 2013, the chlamydia rate in blacks was 6.4 times the rate in whites and the rate among American Indians and Alaska natives was almost four times the rate among whites. STD screening: A urine test such as the one pictured can detect chlamydia, which is easily treated with antibiotics . Chlamydia is easily treated with antibiotics. Untreated, it can damage a woman's reproductive system. According to the CDC, chlamydia can be contacted through vaginal, anal or oral sex with someone who has the disease. While most people who have chlamydia have no symptoms, they may experience an abnormal discharge or a burning sensation when urinating several weeks after sex with an infected partner. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention also reported that gonorrhea cases declined by less than 1per cent. The numbers for the most contagious forms of syphilis rose about 10per cent - to 17,375. The increase was mainly among gay men.",The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said that the rate and number of chlamydia cases fell last year by 1.5per cent .
"Paranoid schizophrenic Leslie Gadsby, who killed his father after being freed because a hospital mental health ward was full, went on to stab his mother to death inside his secure unit . A paranoid schizophrenic who killed his father after being freed because a hospital mental health ward was full went on to stab his mother to death inside his secure unit. An independent report into Edna Gadsby's death found that both she and her taxi driver son Leslie were 'seriously failed' by mental health professionals at Mersey Care NHS trust. After suffering paranoid hallucinations Gadbsy, now 42, was admitted to a hospital mental health unit in 2003 but there were no beds available, leaving him free to bludgeon his father Arthur to death with a hammer in their family kitchen in Gateacre, Liverpool, just two days later. He was given a conditional discharge following his father's death, but while he was living at the secure Scott Clinic mental health centre in Stoneycroft in 2010 he stabbed Mrs Gadsby, 70, in the throat before going downstairs to chat to social workers about Scrabble. The damning  report - compiled by a panel of doctors and mental health experts - outlined multiple failings by the Mersey Care NHS Trust and independent charity Imagine, who ran the facility in Tuebrook. Among the failings listed in the report were that Mrs Gadsby was found dead inside his flat - which was supposed to be a '24-hour mental health facility', and that she had been placed in 'unmitigated risk' Gadsby was first diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia in 2003, and admitted to hospital shortly afterwards. However, officials were unable to find a bed for him until two days later. When a carer called to organise picking him up to take him to hospital, a police officer answered and said he had killed his father by bludgeoning him with a hammer in the kitchen of the family home. He received a conditional discharge two years after the killing of his father, but the report found that mental health workers 'did not recognise the level of risk he posed to himself and others', and told him to move to a more independent flat in 2010. Just days later, his mother came to visit the flat, where she was was brutally stabbed. Gadsby later returned to the family home to set it alight. Following his release on conditional discharge, Gadsby was meant to be monitored 24 hours a day and contact with his mother was supposed to be carefully supervised. However, the report found that ‘unacceptable’ planning failures 'in effect left Mr Gadsby to regulate his own activities and set his own boundaries.' The report said this damning 'failing of duty of care' left the seriously ill man with no safety net strong enough to ensure his safety, or the safety of his mother. While Gadsby was living at a secure Scott Clinic mental health centre in Stoneycroft in 2010 he stabbed Edna Gadsby, 70, in the throat before going downstairs to chat to social workers about Scrabble . He had even tried to mutilate himself with a broken toothbrush while under watch, thinking that it was his testosterone that had made him aggressive. Investigators ruled that had Gadsby been 'subject to robust supervision' the risk of him killing his mother would have been 'substantially reduced'. They admitted that there was a serious causal link between lack of care and treatment, and the death of Mrs Gadsby. The 400-page document also found there was no system to detect a relapse in his mental state, meaning that officials consistently reported back that he was doing well and recommended moving him to a more independent flat. The Gadsby family were even forced to make their own arrangements to protect Mrs Gadsby after officials failed to manage his release - making 'no effort' to educate or support them. The damning report into failings by the Mersey Care NHS Trust and independent charity Imagine, who ran the Scott Clinic facility in Tuebrook found that: . Gadsby was said to have a 'loving relationship with both his parents' and worked for 10 years as a taxi driver in Liverpool before being diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia. After the death of her husband,  long-suffering Mrs Gadsby, who was also seriously wounded, told officers she 'felt it would have been better if her son had killed her too'. But she continued to visit her son and tried to rebuild a relationship with him despite protests from concerned family members who told her 'she should have locked him up and throw away the key.' Gadsby's uncle even contacted officials to express his concern that Gadsby was on bail and might try and approach his mother, but social workers had said he was ‘happy and relaxed’. Meanwhile, Gadsby had made a secret trip to the house of an ex-girlfriend, appearing at her door wearing just a pair of tights over his underwear and offering her a cheque for £7,800, which the report said was a classic sign of relapse for his condition. He had failed to take his anti-psychotic medication properly for years, and had never been offered Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) - a key road to recovery for thousands of mental health patients. Just five months after brutally killing his father after an argument over money, his risk of aggression and violence was deemed ‘low’ by carers, despite him suffering 'paranoid ideas about his neighbours and members of his family.' Gadsby also thought people could read his thoughts and were monitoring his movements on a daily basis leaving him wary of authority and scared of being sectioned. Following his discharge to the Scott Clinic in late 2006, a social worker noted that he 'still presents a risk in keeping things to himself and letting them build up until it’s too late.' The report concluded that it was hoped it would hightlight failings from the tragic case and put measures in place to stop any future incidents after Gadsby and his family were left with 'no support' to help develop strategies to cope with his illness, leaving him 'vulnerable to relapse'. Mersey Care has vowed to improve care for mentally ill patients after the 'devastating report'. The investigation recommended that the Scott Clinic should have a system where workers are aware if patients have guests, and that the staff flat should be moved to the ground floor. At the time of Mrs Gadsby’s death, her son’s flat was on the ground floor, with staff upstairs. The report also recommend that injured family members of mentally ill people be provided with a ‘support package’, as well as improved communication throughout. 'It’s a devastating report, it’s devastating for the Gadsby family and it’s devastating for me as a nurse,' said Ray Walker, Executive Director of Nursing and Social Care for Mersey Care NHS Trust. 'What’s important in these situations is to find out how you can learn from those mistakes and ensure those things don’t happen again. 'We were aware of some of the findings coming out of the independent report, which means we were able to implement some changes some time ago and we’re actioning on a number of fronts and have been able to progress in a number of things, like better team-working and better risk-assessment. 'It’s been a very difficult lesson for us to learn, but it’s provided us with an opportunity to help us going forward. 'It really is a matter of a number of things that come together at the same time, it was a cumulative effect of a number of failings. 'Not to minimise those failings, they were important things, but actually it was all together that those problems resulted in the death. 'It’s been over five years, and the director of patient safety has remained in contact with the family. They’ve conducted themselves in a very respectful manner, and the family have been very dignified throughout the process and they want to make sure this kind of thing doesn’t happen again - and we support them in that.

"Authorities have raided the home of the Sydney siege terrorist's wife, carting away huge paper bags and wheeling containers of unknown material out of the home as neighbours told of their encounters with the murderous militant. Man Haron Monis, 50, killed two hostages and died in a hail of bullets in the early hours of Tuesday morning after he kept more than a dozen people prisoner inside the Lindt chocolate store in the Sydney central business district (CBD) for more than sixteen hours. Monis regularly stayed at his wife Amirah's family home in Belmore, in south-west Sydney, where neighbours said they could often hear his prayers to Allah - so loud sometimes they could hear them while underwater in the pool. Amirah's brother John Aspros was shocked to hear the news that Monis had died and said he was only aware of the siege. 'He was killed?' he asked. Scroll down for video .

Monis was charged with being an accessory to the murder. The militant has a considerable rap sheet. He was facing sexual assault charges for sexually abusing a woman in Wentworthville, in western Sydney, while he was advertising himself as a ‘spiritual healer’. He was also convicted of sending abusive letters to the families of deceased Australian Defence Force personnel. ‘I knew he was an imbecile,’ the neighbour said. Monis would occasionally say hello but never speak to them. The only common sign of his presence was the regular, loud prayers they heard during the day, which one neighbour said they could hear while swimming underwater in their pool. ‘It was no more praying than you’d hear in a minaret,’ a neighbour said.

"A group of people traveling in Canada have captured a video they described as 'the sight of a lifetime'. Inside a taxi journeying from Fort Providence to Yellowknife in northwest Canada, the group happened to stumble across a herd of bison. However as the car got closer, they realized at least three wolves were trying to take down the herd. Fortunately for the buffalo, the wolves were scared off by the cab, and scattered into the nearby woods. Scroll down for video . Rescued: As the cab approaches the herd under attack, three wolves can be seen scattering for the woods . Rare sight: The whole scene was captured on video using a cell phone .

'Those buffalo got saved by us, eh?' one woman can be heard saying in the video. 'That was amazing. I don't know when we'll ever see that again.' The video was posted to Facebook by user Kerry Mercer, believed to be the person filming. The person then thanks the driver for slowing down. 'No problem,' he says. 'It's good to see.' Safe: The herd were able to continue with their journey once the wolves fled . Heading for the hills: As a truck approaches, the herd move off into the woods . Adding to the footage is the fact that sunlight breaks right after the herd is rescued. The light quickly switches from blue to an orange hue. It's not uncommon for people to take a taxi between Yellowknife and Fort Providence — a distance of about 315 kilometers.

"A drug-resistant 'superbug' that is notoriously difficult to treat has been discovered in the waters where Rio de Janeiro's Olympic sailing events will be held. Scientists have warned of a danger to swimmers from the contaminated water, with the so-called KPC enzyme being notoriously difficult to treat. Those who come into contact with the bug can require hospitalization, or in some cases, become carriers of the micro-organism, researchers claim. Scroll down for video . Sailors of the Finn class compete during the first test event for the Rio 2016 Olympic Games at Guanabara Bay in August . The Instituto Oswaldo Cruz, Brazil's most respected health research institute, said it had discovered bacteria that produce the enzyme in water samples taken from various spots along the Carioca River, Rio de Janeiro. Among the spots is where the river flows into the city's Guanabara Bay, site of the 2016 sailing and wind surfing events. Bacteria with the KPC enzyme are difficult to treat. However, the institute said no instances of infection resulting from the contaminated water have yet been detected. The study's co-ordinator, Ana Paula D'Alincourt Carvalho Assef, said: 'The illnesses caused by these micro-organisms are the same as those caused by common bacteria, but they require stronger antibiotics and, sometimes, can require hospitalization. 'Since the super bacteria are resistant to the most modern medications, doctors need to rely on drugs that are rarely used because they are toxic to the organism. 'Carriers can take these resistant bacteria back to their own environments and to other people, resulting in a cycle of dissemination,' said the institute, which is affiliated with Brazil's Health Ministry. Small boats sit on the polluted shore of Guanabara Bay, across the bay from Rio de Janeiro, Brazil . Pictured is Guanabara Bay where the 'superbug' was discovered, with Rio de Janeiro's famous Sugarloaf Mountain towering above it . With some 70 percent of sewage in the city of 12 million going untreated — and flowing, raw, into rivers, onto beaches and into the Guanabara Bay — the state of water quality has been a major worry ahead of the 2016 summer games. In their Olympic bid, organizers pledged to slash by 80 percent the amount of sewage and garbage that's pumped into the bay daily, but critics insist little has been done. Water quality tests still show sky-high levels of fecal matter throughout much of the bay, and authorities have a near-blanket standing recommendation against swimming on any of its beaches. Flamengo beach, where the super bacteria was discovered, is among the Guanabara Bay beaches considered unfit for swimming. The beach, which is adjacent to the Gloria Marina, the starting point for the Olympic sailing events, is also to be the viewing area for the events. Ben Remocker, a former member of Canada's Olympic sailing team who represents athletes in two sailing disciplines, called the findings 'serious for our athletes.' Garbage lies on the banks of the badly polluted Guanabara Bay . Olympic Games organisers have pledged to slash by 80 per cent the amount of sewage and garbage that is pumped into Guanabara Bay (pictured) on a daily basis . 'We're going to be troubled by this,' he said, adding he didn't think the possible health risks would dissuade sailors from taking part in the games. 'I think the sailors are probably going to cross their fingers they aren't going to get sick.' The super bacteria were discovered in three out of five samples taken from along the course of the Carioca River. It's not entirely clear how the bacteria may have gotten into the river. 'The first point in which we detect its presence was... after the river passes through areas with homes and hospitals,' Assef said. Organizers of the Rio games declined to comment, saying they would have to look into the findings before responding.","Scientists detect drug-resistant bacteria in Rio's Olympic sailing waters .

"Accused: MP Eric Joyce has been charged with criminal damage and two counts of assault . MP Eric Joyce has been charged with criminal damage and two counts of assault after an altercation with teenagers at a shop. The 54-year-old independent member for Falkirk explained his actions after the incident, insisted he was only trying to stop a young vandal smashing up the property in Chalk Farm, North London. Today, however, the Metropolitan Police confirmed he has been charged and will appear before Highbury Corner magistrates on December 30. Writing on his blog following his arrest on October 17, Mr Joyce, a former Army major and former Labour MP, said: 'I detained a youth in a shop in London. Damage had been done to the store. 'I asked the shopkeeper to call the police, and when officers arrived they arrested the youth and informed me that drugs had been recovered from the scene. 'The officers also informed me that the youth had immediately made a complaint that I had assaulted him by detaining him.' The Metropolitan Police revealed the arrest after writing to House speaker John Bercow on October 21, according to an entry in the Commons records. Mr Joyce added at the time: 'I am not in the habit of summoning the police if I feel that I am in the wrong.' A police spokesman said at the time that officers were called to 'reports of a fight'. The statement added: 'Upon arrival officers found a man and two teenage boys involved in an altercation. 'A 54-year-old man was subsequently arrested on suspicion of ABH. 'A 14-year-old boy [B] was also arrested at the scene for possession of cannabis. Shop: The MP offered his account of what happened at this shop - and said he was the one who called police .

"Britain could be hit 'at any moment' by a Sydney-style terror attack, David Cameron told MPs last night. The Prime Minister said the Australian attack, in which two hostages died and Islamic extremist Man Haron Monis was killed, was a reminder of the danger Britain faces. He said it was only through the efforts of the security services that plots to murder UK police officers ‘in cold blood’ had been foiled in recent months. Prime Minister David Cameron said Australia was a country 'very close to our hearts', and warned the attack in Sydney could be repeated in the UK . Mr Cameron told MPs on the Liaison Committee that the threat Britain faced 'definitely' included lone-wolf attacks like in Sydney . But he warned it was much harder for the authorities to prevent attacks by fanatics who are ‘self-radicalised on the internet’ than to tackle known extremists who had travelled to the Middle East. The Prime Minister, appearing before senior MPs at the Commons Liaison Committee, said: ‘The threat we face definitely includes those sort of self-starting, sometimes quite random attacks that could happen at any moment in Britain. ‘We’ve seen over the last few months there have been a series of plots that have been detected and prevented that would have seen police officers or other authorities murdered in cold blood. ‘It’s thanks to the brilliance of our security services that these things have been prevented.’ But he added: ‘We can’t count on them to prevent it every time because it is one thing understanding the terror networks coming out of Pakistan or Afghanistan or Iraq and Syria, trying to monitor what they’re doing, who’s going and who’s returning. That’s one thing. ‘But people who are self-radicalised on the internet, who then suddenly do appalling things, that is much more difficult to prevent.’ The Prime Minister's remarks come amid widespread horror at the twin terror attacks in Sydney and Pakistan which have left more than hundred people dead. In Sydney, the Iranian asylum seeker Monis struck terror into the heart of the city's financial district after taking 17 staff and customers hostages inside the Lindt cafe in Martin Place for 16 hours. The 50-year-old gunman is believed to have fired the first shots, which sparked teams of heavily armed police to swoop on the café at 2am on Tuesday. Tori Johnson, the café manager, and barrister mother-of-three Katrina Dawson were the two hostages killed during the bloody climax to the stand-off. The tragedy came before Taliban gunmen stormed a school in Pakistan and slaughtered 132 children today. The 34-year-old manager of the Lindt cafe, Tori Johnson (left), and mother of three Katrina Dawson, 38 (right), have been named as the two hostages killed during the Sydney siege on Tuesday morning . Convoys of UK and American military hardware being shipped back from Afghanistan could face attack by terrorists, it is feared. Thousands of vehicles and containers of equipment are being brought home as part of the withdrawal of Nato combat troops. Some will be transported by land and sea, via Pakistan. But one of the main routes to the port of Karachi is through Peshawar, the scene of yesterday’s Taliban attack. A second, more southerly route goes via the city of Quetta, a base for the Afghan Taliban that has been plagued by sectarian violence. Speaking before the siege in Australia came to an end yesterday Mr Cameron warned that the tragedy may have been played out more than 10,000 miles away, but it could be repeated in Britain. The security services have warned ministers that an attack in the UK from such a fanatic is ‘almost inevitable’. Andrew Parker, the director of MI5, warned last year that Britain was facing a grave terror threat, including from ‘several thousand’ Islamist extremists who are living here and want to attack the country. In August, the UK’s threat level was raised from ‘substantial’ to ‘severe’ amid increasing concerns that hundreds of jihadis were returning to British streets from the wars in Iraq and Syria. Last week, police forces across Britain were put on alert after a warning of an Islamist plot to kidnap and behead an officer. More than 7,000 officers in the West Midlands – the UK’s second-largest force – were warned they were in imminent danger following a telephone threat. It follows last year’s savage murder of soldier Lee Rigby in broad daylight. There are also fears that hundreds of people are being radicalised in British prisons. The soldier was murdered by two Muslim converts who ambushed him as he walked back to his barracks in Woolwich, South East London, last year. Mr Cameron called on Muslim communities in Britain to do more to stand up, oppose extremists and say they are ‘not speaking in my name’. He suggested the perception of Muslims as ‘victims’ must be challenged as part of efforts to stamp out radicalism. Gunman Man Haron Monis, pictured here protesting charges against him earlier this year, held 17 people hostage in the Lindt cafe . He admitted it was a ‘worry’ so many people seemed to be being radicalised in public institutions such as schools. But he said the Coalition’s proposed new duty on figures of authority to report concerns about radicalisation could help to address the problem. The Prime Minister told LBC Radio: 'Obviously it's an extremely worrying situation. It demonstrates the challenge we face of Islamist extremist violence all over the world. Met police chief Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe warned of the threat posed by lone wolf attacks . 'This is on the other side of the world but is the sort of thing that could just as well happen here in the UK or in Europe.' He said Australia was a country 'very close to our hearts', adding: 'We very much stand with the Australians at their time of need. It is a reminder of the threat that we face and the need to be vigilant.' Police and security officials have warned it is 'almost inevitable' that Britain will be hit by an attack by fanatics who have been 'militarised' by Islamic State. Mr Cameron announced last month that an extra £130million will be made available over the next two years for the security services to 'monitor and disrupt those self-starting terrorists'. A new legal obligation will be imposed on universities, prisons, councils and schools to play their part in tackling 'this poisonous extremism', the Prime Minister said. Mr Cameron told MPs: 'The reason for providing some extra money today is that there is a specific and growing challenge from these self-starting—they are sometimes called 'lone wolf'—jihadis, who have been radicalised on the internet because of what has been happening in Syria but are not necessarily linked up with other terrorist networks. 'That puts extra pressure on and we need to respond to that.' The security agencies face unprecedented pressure to prevent similar attacks by extremists acting alone, but it is much harder to detect and disrupt plots if they are not part of a wider terror network. Met police chief Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe warned: 'It doesn't take an awful lot of organising, doesn't take too many to conspire together, there's no great complexity to it. 'So that means we have got a very short time to interdict, to actually intervene and make sure that these people don't get away with it.' Unveiling new laws to counter the extremist threat, Home Secretary Theresa May revealed 40 terrorists plots have been thwarted in Britain since the July 7 attacks nine years ago. The foiled atrocities including 'marauding' 'Mumbai-style' gun attacks streets, an attempt to blow up the London Stock Exchange and airplanes, and murder troops and a British ambassador. Unveiling a raft of new counter-terror measures in November, the Home Secretary warned the threat to Britain is 'greater than it ever has been' and stressed the terrorists 'only have to be lucky once'.","Prime Minister says series of plots 'have been detected and prevented'

Adorable tots Louie and Connie Cocker have become YouTube stars this festive season as a video of them opening terrible Christmas gifts from their father has gone viral . Their father, and XFM Manchester presenter, Tim Cocker, 33, who lives in Chorlton with Louie and Connie's mother Kate, can be heard behind the camera telling the children: 'Because you've been really good, I'm going to let you open one present early.' Despite believing they are about to receive exciting toys - Connie predicts she's getting a 'Barbie Princess and King Ken' and Louie, a Ben Ten watch - the onion and banana induce much excitement in their new owners. Louie delightedly declares: 'I've got a banana Daddy!' before Connie chimes in thanking her dad for the 'pumpkin'. 'I was really proud,' Tim tells the MailOnline of his kids' reaction. 'It was a cheeky prank on my part and I wasn't sure how it was going to play out. It was pure childhood innocence at its best.' Left: Connie (left) is delighted with her 'pumpkin'; Right: Louie (right) turns his banana into a giant smile . 'It made me go a bit misty eyed if I'm honest,' Tim admits. 'Fortunately Connie had an onion so I could just blame any watery eyes on that!' Tim decided to try the little experiment to see whether the mere idea of getting a gift was enough to excite little ones. 'I know that Louie and Connie are very fortunate that I'm in a position to give them the presents on their list, with Santa's help of course, but I'm also very aware that this isn't the case for all children. 'Do we really need to fight over the season's must have gift in supermarket aisles? Or is there still joy to be had with simply opening a gift, whatever it is? 'I thought this would test how grateful the kids were to be getting a gift at all.' Tim, pictured with Connie (left) and Louie (centre), says: 'I wanted to see if there is still joy to be had with simply opening a gift, whatever it is' Left: The Cocker family, top to bottom, Connie, now five, Tim, Kate, and Louie, now six; Right: Dad Tim with Louie (left) and Connie (right) But even Tim admits he was pleasantly surprised by the reactions. 'Louie and Connie are happy, cheerful kids so I knew they wouldn't throw a major tantrum. But I never expected them to be that excited about some fruit and veg! 'If only they were that excited about it when it's time to eat their greens at dinner.' The clip was shot three years ago but  only in the last two days has the clip become been widely shared on YouTube. This year, Louie and Connie, who are now 6 and 5, won't be receiving fruit and veg on Christmas Day. 'Connie, like many children, is obsessed with Frozen so I've put in a request with Santa's elves to work extra hard on some of those toys. 'Louie is hoping Santa can add to his Hotwheels and Lego Star Wars collections. They've sent their letters to the North Pole so hopefully St. Nick will come up trumps again!'","Louie Cocker, 3, and sister Connie, 2, are seen receiving a banana and an onion in the adorable video .

"Lava from a volcano on Hawaii's Big Island is on course to reach a shopping center with a gas station and a supermarket in seven to 10 days, officials said. Lava is about 1 mile from the shopping center in the small town of Pahoa, Hawaii County Civil Defense Director Darryl Oliveira said Monday. The shopping center also contains a hardware store, pharmacy and auto repair shop. There's still a great deal of uncertainty about when the lava might reach the center and what it could hit. The lava could smother one structure in the complex or cover them all, he said. Creeping along:  The active lava flow front, seen in this Friday photogrpah,  continues to advance downslope towards the northeast about a mile and a half from the marketplace in Pahoa, Hawaii . Pathway: A stalled lobe of the June 27 lava flow which came within feet of the transfer station in Pahoa, Hawaii is seen last Monday . 'It just depends on what the flow does as it comes through,' he told reporters during a conference call. Oliveira says the county has been in touch with the merchants about evacuation plans. The county hasn't yet advised them to leave. The supermarket, one of the biggest stores in the center, plans to start removing equipment on Tuesday and shut down on Thursday. Malama Market said in a statement it was encouraging customers to keep shopping until its doors close. Sheryl Toda, a spokesperson for the Sullivan Family of Companies told The Star-Advertiser 'Our employees are our top priorities and right now we're looking into various options on how to help them through the transition.' 83 people work at the store, the newspaper reported. 'It just seems to move fast, then slow down, move fast, then slow down again,' Supercuts manager Duchess Kama told The Star-Advertiser. 'We're more anxious because it's getting closer, and it's the unknown part — that's what makes you anxious.' The gas station would sell its remaining fuel and pump out what's leftover if it does have to evacuate, Oliveira said. It would then fill its tanks with water and firefighting foam. Crossing:  Frank Trusdell of the U.S. Geological Survey's Hawaiian Volcano Observatory walks across a section of the June 27 lava flow that crossed Cemetery Road in Pahoa, Hawaii last Monday . Before and after: Hawaiian Volcano Observatory spokeswoman Janet Babb is seen with a photo in her arms in Pahoa . This plan has been approved the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and by the state Department of Health, he said. An earlier idea called for the gas station to put sand into the tanks, but this wouldn't have removed all flammable vapors. It also would have destroyed the pumping system. By using firefighting foam, the gas station may use the tanks again if lava bypasses the area and it wants to reopen. Lava has never hit a gas station on the Big Island in the past, Oliveira said. Lava from Kilauea volcano has been threatening Pahoa town, which has a population of about 900, for months. In October, it burned a house and covered part of a cemetery but stalled just before hitting Pahoa's main road. It later started flowing from a different spot. The lava could still cross the town's main road and a highway, which would make it more difficult for residents of Pahoa and the broader community of Puna to get to other parts of the island. Two brothers who run an auto shop in Pahoa, Brady and Myke Metcalf, have taken to selling t-shirts with the words '2014 Go With the Flow Tour,'The Hawaii Tribune-Herald reported. 'The picture of the lava, this isn’t us wishing for this to happen, It's a cartoon,' Brady Metcalf told the newspaper. Myke Metcalf told The Hawaii Tribune-Herald more than 500 shirts have been purchased. Defense: A geologist uses a handheld GPS unit to mark the lava flow margin coordinates in Pahoa on Friday. Officials say lava from Kilauea volcano is on course to reach a shopping center   in seven to ten days .

"Classical musician: Katherine Jenkinson (pictured) was told her 11-week-old daughter Olivia was not allowed in London's Oriental Club and was forced to breastfeed her in a parked car outside the premises . A classical musician was banned from taking her newborn baby into a private members club - and had to breastfeed her outside in a car. Cellist Katherine Jenkinson, 34, is breastfeeding her 11-week-old daughter Olivia Grace. She had hoped a babysitter could look after the child in her dressing room while she played Haydn’s Piano Trio in G major at the exclusive Oriental Club. But she was told the baby was not allowed into the central London venue because it would be against a by-law which prohibits anyone under the age of 12 from entering. Instead, the babysitter had to wait outside the venue with Olivia Grace and Miss Jenkinson had to leave the building during the interval to feed her baby. The classical cello player breastfed her youngster in a parked car outside the premises, and when she returned to the venue to take to the stage, the babysitter walked around a nearby Marks and Spencer store with Olivia. Miss Jenkinson told the Daily Telegraph: ‘I’d already arranged a second babysitter to be at home with my four-year-old son as I’m fully aware that it is often inappropriate to take children to such events. ‘Does this really apply to a breastfed 11-week-old babe in arms? I found the way they handled the whole situation very upsetting, insensitive and quite frankly rude.’ Playing in a small ensemble, she has been unable to take maternity leave. Because her daughter is only breastfed, she has to travel with her mother. Miss Jenkinson said her dressing room was two floors below the bar and dining area where her group - the Aquinas Piano Trio - were performing. There was no chance of any of the club members - who pay an annual membership fee of up to £1,000 - being disturbed by her baby. Scroll down for videos . Venue: Miss Jenkinson had hoped a babysitter could look after the child in her dressing room while she played at the exclusive Oriental Club (above) in central London, but was told children weren't allowed inside . Miss Jenkinson said she had asked a lawyer friend to look into the situation because she was so upset. She told The Times: ‘I have been advised the club is in the wrong. Even though it is a private members club it is not allowed to do that. It is not about legal action. ‘It is how upset I feel for my baby girl being sent into a freezing winter’s night when there was a perfectly good dressing room where she could have stayed. It would have done no harm to let her in.’ Group violinist Ruth Rogers talked to the club management ‘for hours’ on the morning of the concert in an effort to resolve the issue. The exclusive club was founded nearly 200 years ago by returning officers and officials from India and the East. The first members had to have a connection to that quarter of the globe and it was frequented by distinguished dignitaries, returning servicemen and civil servants, those who had ridden elephants and dined with Indian princes. The by-laws banning children from the venue are the club's own regulations, which could be a breach of the law. The  Equality Act 2010 made it illegal for anyone to ask a breastfeeding woman to leave a public place such as a cafe, shop or public transport, unless it was deemed unsafe or there was a good reason why the premises was single-sex. Last night no-one at the club was available for comment. ‘Victorian’ policy: The incident comes after mother-of-three Lou Burns (pictured), 35, was recently asked to cover herself with a large napkin *(right) as she breastfed her baby at the five-star Claridge’s hotel in Mayfair . Controversy: Claridge's said it 'embraces' breastfeeding, but asks that women are 'discreet towards guests' The incident last week comes after mother Lou Burns, 35, was recently asked to cover herself as she breastfed her baby in Claridge’s hotel. The mother of three  was left humiliated after staff at the five-star Mayfair hotel gave her a giant napkin to cover up as she fed her 12-week-old daughter Isadora during afternoon tea. Mrs Burns, who is married to comedy actor Nick Burns, was reportedly told by staff to use the napkin to avoid 'causing offence', but said she was left humiliated and burst into tears afterwards. At the time, she said: ‘I was really shocked as I had never experienced this before. Through my tears I tried to explain that I was really quite cross.' She criticised the hotel’s ‘Victorian’ policy and the incident led to a mass breastfeeding protest outside the five-star Mayfair hotel. The demonstration, organised by Free to Feed - which campaigns for the 'normalising' of public breastfeeding - saw dozens of mothers brave freezing conditions to sit outside the hotel's grand front doors and feed their infants. Claridge's has said it 'embraces' breastfeeding, but requests that women are 'discreet towards other guests'. Many travelled from as far away as Staffordshire for the protest, which came after UKIP leader Nigel Farage waded into the debate, by suggesting mothers of newborn babies should avoid being 'openly ostentatious' when breastfeeding and think about sitting in a corner when doing so. He insisted it was 'not too difficult' to feed a child in a way that was 'not openly ostentatious', and even defended the Mayfair hotel, saying that each establishment should be able to impose their own rules about when and where breastfeeding should be done. Protest: A group of about 40 mothers took part in a demonstration outside Claridge's following the incident . Demonstration: The mothers breastfed their babies after the hotel forced the mother to cover up with a napkin . The UKIP leader also suggested that many people feel 'very, very embarrassed' when they see a child being breastfed. His comments sparked fury, with many Twitter users suggesting that Mr Farage himself should 'hide in the corner' over his 'outrageous' stance. Mumsnet chief executive Justine Roberts also added that it was 'bemusing' for anyone to think of breastfeeding as 'ostentatious'. But as the backlash over his comments grew, the outspoken MP attempted to play down the controversy by insisting he did not 'personally endorse' women perhaps sitting in a corner. However, in a statement released through Twitter to clarify his position, Mr Farage still maintained it was up to each establishment to decide on their own rules. The latest controversy comes at a time when more women are being encouraged to breastfeed, with a new study suggesting that continuing to do so until babies are 18 months old could save the NHS £40million. Opinion: UKIP leader Nigel Farage (above) waded into the debate, by suggesting mothers of newborns should avoid being 'openly ostentatious' when breastfeeding and maybe consider sitting in a corner when doing so . The government argues that breastfeeding has 'huge health benefits for mother and baby', particularly vulnerable babies in neonatal and special care baby units. A report by a team of researchers led by Brunel University has suggested that the NHS could save millions by enoucraging women to breastfeed for longer, reducing common childhood illnesses and also cutting the risk of women developing breast cancer over their lifetime, which is said to be linked to low rates of breastfeeding. However, on its website, the NHS says: 'You shouldn't ever be made to feel uncomfortable about breastfeeding in public. 'In fact, the Equality Act 2010 has made it illegal for anyone to ask a breastfeeding woman to leave a public place such as a cafe, shop or public transport.' MailOnline has contacted the Oriental Club for comment. According to the Equality Act of 2010, it is discriminatory to treat a woman unfavourably because she is breastfeeding. However, in September a breastfeeding mother claimed that she was ordered to cover up with a dirty dishcloth while joining friends for a breakfast. Olivia Pozniak, a single 25-year-old, was feeding her 11-week-old son Louie at the Furze Wren pub owned by J D Wetherspoon in Bexleyheath, Kent, when she was told to cover up. Meanwhile, in August Natasha Barnett, 29, from Newport Pagnell, Buckinghamshire, was told by a lifeguard at Middleton Pool that she could not breastfeed her five-month-old daughter Olive because it was 'classed as eating and drinking'. In June, a mother was asked to sit in a corner by a waitress while breastfeeding her son - to keep her away from schoolchildren eating in the same restaurant. Carrie Davies, 27, was left feeling 'embarrassed and ashamed' after staff at Global Buffet in Cardiff suggested she move while feeding her four-month-old son Trystan. Ms Davies, who was lunching with a friend, was offered a spot by the restaurant's toilets, which bosses at the restaurant say was more 'convenient' for her in light of a large school party who had started eating there. It comes after around 70 women descended on Sports Direct in Nottingham city centre in April to show support for 25-year-old Wioletta Komar, who claimed she was kicked out of the premises earlier this year for breastfeeding her three-month-old son. She claims a member of staff suddenly marched over and told her that breastfeeding mothers were not welcome because of 'company policy'. The sales assistant then told her that the store had no facilities for her and suggested she should go to McDonald's which had a baby and mother room.","Cellist Katherine Jenkinson is breastfeeding her daughter Olivia Grace .

"The hostage-taker killed after a siege in Sydney had fled Iran after embezzling some $200,000 from the travel agency where he worked, it is claimed. It is the latest allegation to emerge against self-styled cleric Man Haron Monis, who was shot dead after a prolonged stand-off with police at a Sydney cafe on Monday. Of his 17 hostages, two - cafe manager Tori Johnson and barrister Katrina Dawson - were killed in the incident. Scroll down for video . 'Fraudster': Man Haron Monis fled Iran after embezzling some $200,000 from travel agency clients then avoided an extradition request from the Islamic republic by claiming asylum, it is claimed . An Iranian source told the Iran-focused Manoto News that Monis, known as Mohammad Hassan Manteqi in his home country, fled Iran in 1995 with about $200,000 entrusted with him by clients. He had been the managing director of a tourist agency and had access to the cash to help about 50 customers apply for visas to visit western countries, the London-based site reported. After arriving in Australia Monis campaigned to be granted asylum, despite an Interpol alert. His refugee status protected him from an Iranian extradition request alleging fraud. The latest revelation comes after court documents showed Monis was facing up to 50 sexual offence charges, including aggravated sexual assault, aggravated indecent assault and inciting a teenage girl to commit an indecent act. He painted the breasts and bodies of women with water, massaged their breasts and rubbed his genitals against them and raped them in 'spiritual healing' sessions all over Sydney going back 13 years, the documents allege. Victims: An injured hostage is wheeled to an ambulance after shots were fired  at Martin Place . Fear: Hostages run towards armed tactical response police as they run to freedom from the cafe under siege . The 50-year-old committed the sexual offences against women at his Spiritual Consultation business in the Sydney suburbs of Burwood, Liverpool, Westmead and Belmore between September 2001 and September this year, according to the documents. He had been due to face court on February 27 next year. A second source told Manoto News that Monis had in Iran been married to a university professor whose father is a deputy head of Imam Sadeq University, a key academic institution for Iranian officials.","Allegation is latest to emerge against self-styled cleric Man Haron Monis .

"An 11-year-old girl has died from a mystery allergic reaction while on a family vacation to Hawaii. Paige Warner, from Roseville, California, went swimming with her younger sister Violet during their Thanksgiving trip to Honolulu but after 10 minutes, she complained that her nose was burning. Her throat started to swell up and she struggled to breathe, her mother, Karin Carpenter, told KTXL. While Paige had long suffered from food allergies and was sensitive to 'environmental conditions', the family had always been able to get her reactions under control, her mother said. Mystery: Paige Warner, pictured, passed away earlier this month after suffering an allergic reaction while on a family trip to Honolulu over Thanksgiving. Doctors are stumped over what triggered the reaction . 'This time, I just knew that something was wrong,' Carpenter said. They called 911. 'She looked at me and said, 'I'm dying. I know I'm going to die because I can see the look on your face',' Carpenter said as she became emotional. Paige was rushed to hospital. The reaction caused her lungs to close up and her heart to stop, and staff performed CPR on the girl for an hour, friends explained on a gofundme page. She was put in a coma and the page expresses hope that she will recover, but she died days later. Her family is at a loss over what could have killed her, KTXL reported. Heartbroken: Paige, pictured with her family, had been swimming in a pool in Honolulu with her young sister Violet, left, over Thanksgiving when her nose started burning and her throat began to close up . Tragic: Her heart stopped and medical staff managed to get it beating again but she slipped into a coma and passed away earlier this month. Her family said they could usually get her allergies under control . Doctors are still not sure what could have caused the reaction but Carpenter has been told that anything from volcanic ash in the area to the temperature of the pool could have contributed. The gofundmepage has raised more than $28,000 for the family. On the page, friends and family paid tribute to the little girl, whom they remembered as a talented artist who played in her school band. Carpenter also thanked people for their generosity. 'I am in complete shock and awe, of this generous outpouring for Paige,' she wrote on the page last week. 'I cannot even begin to express my gratitude for the hundreds of people who have left messages, donations, and prayers for my sweet daughter. Hope: Paige's mother Karin, pictured, said Violet (left) is now helping her and her husband to heal . 'This has devastated and shocked my family in the deepest way imaginable, but we are reminded of the beautiful and giving hearts of our friends, both close to us and friends who we have never met.' Carpenter said that, as the family struggles with Paige's death, her younger sister Violet is helping them heal. She has insisted that they put up Christmas decorations despite their sadness. 'Violet has been our ray of sunshine, keeping us eating and just taking care of ourselves,' Carpenter said. They will hold a funeral for their daughter in January.","After swimming in a pool during a family vacation to Honolulu, Paige Warner's nose started burning and her throat began to swell up .

Their long bushy tails are seen poking out among the balls with their bodies submerged. At one point one of the critters breaks free from dinner time and says hello to the camera.

"A woman is facing a felony aggravated assault charge in Wyoming after police say she bit off part of her boyfriend's chin during an argument. Lola Lauren Brush, 30, of Jackson was arrested on December 6 and faces the felony and a domestic battery charge. Brush faces a maximum of 10 and a half years in jail and a $10,750 fine if she pleads or is found guilty. Lola Lauren Brush of Jackson, Wyoming, is accused of biting off part of her boyfriend's chin during an argument and beat him with a SpongeBob Squarepants children's snow shovel . Police say Brush bit part of her boyfriend's chin off and beat the 30-year-old man with objects including a SpongeBob Squarepants children’s snow shovel and a wooden baseball bat during an argument. Doctors were unable to reattach the man's chin and he now must undergo plastic surgery, said Jackson police Lt. Cole Nethercott on Monday. Brush is out of jail on a $7,500 unsecured bond despite the concerns of Teton County Deputy Prosecutor Terry Rogers that she was a ‘very violent’ flight risk, reports the Jackson Hole News and Guide. Police were called to the apartment the two share after several neighbors called to report their loud shouting. Officers allegedly found a strip of flesh with part of the victim’s beard on it inside the apartment, and found blood in and around the apartment, as well as on the handle of a SpongeBob Squarepants shovel outside. The fight allegedly occurred while the couple were out at a hockey game, but continued when they returned. While she is out of jail, the judge has ordered Brush to take twice daily portable breath tests at the Teton County Jail and to refrain from possessing or drinking alcohol . The victim was transported to the hospital, where an emergency room doctor 'lost count' of how many stitches it took to close the bite wound on his chin, court files state. Brush’s preliminary hearing is scheduled for Thursday. She is not allowed any contact with her boyfriend while the case makes its way through the courts. While she is out of jail, the judge has ordered Brush to take twice daily portable breath tests at the Teton County Jail and to refrain from possessing or drinking alcohol. She also is required to see a doctor and a therapist and file updates with the court to prove she is following their recommendations.","Lola Lauren Brush of Jackson, Wyoming, is accused of biting off part of her boyfriend's chin during an argument .

"Australian extremist Mohamed Elomar has used Sydney's deadly cafe siege as his latest excuse to exhort Muslims to create chaos in the city by beheading civilians 'ISIS style.' Elomar took to Twitter to gloat at the mayhem surrounding the siege, in which lone fanatic Man Haron Monis held 17 hostages at gunpoint in a central Sydney cafe before police stormed in. Two hostages and Monis were killed. 'How to create chaos in Sydney CBD?

A Twitter account believed to be used by Australian extremist Mohamed Elomar has posted about creating chaos in the Sydney following the city's deadly siege . In a series of later tweets, he says any Australian Muslims should understand that Australia is responsible for killing Muslims in Iraq and Syria, and that 'anyone who has his passport stripped away by his government should start killing innocent civilians.'

"Victims of paedophile DJ Jimmy Savile will receive compensation but less than they had hoped after a judge ordered that lawyers must be paid first . Women who say they were sexually abused by paedophile DJ Jimmy Savile will receive compensation but less than they had hoped after a judge ordered that lawyers must be paid first. The Court of Appeal today sanctioned a compensation scheme set up for victims of the television star. However, three appeal judges said many legal bills would have to be paid out of Savile’s estate - which is thought to be worth around £3 million. Lawyers for the victims said the appeal court decision to back the compensation scheme will bring 'great relief'. They said they are analysing the decision on legal costs - which means that less money will be available to give to victims in compensation - and considering whether to ask the Supreme Court to consider the issue. A High Court judge had sanctioned the compensation scheme following a hearing in London in February - despite objections from a charity which is the major beneficiary of Savile’s estate. The Jimmy Savile Charitable Trust said the scheme - agreed between the estate executor, the NatWest bank, and lawyers representing alleged victims - did not assess the 'validity' of claimants and lacked a 'process of evaluation'. Trustees of the charity had asked the Court of Appeal to review Mr Justice Sales’ decision. However, appeal judges today concluded that Mr Justice Sales had been right to sanction the scheme - and right to refuse to order that NatWest should be replaced as executor. But they said he had been wrong when ordering the trust to pay some of its legal costs and some of the costs run up by the alleged victims. They said those bills should be paid out of estate coffers. Experts initially put the value of Savile’s estate at around £4 million. But in February, Mr Justice Sales said a 'range of expenses' had been incurred and the estate’s value was reduced to about £3.3 million.

But in February, Mr Justice Sales said a 'range of expenses' had been incurred and the estate’s value was reduced to about £3.3 million . A High Court judge had sanctioned the compensation scheme following a hearing in London in February - despite objections from a charity which is the major beneficiary of Savile’s estate . Liz Dux, a lawyer at law firm Slater & Gordon - which represents victims, said: 'Today’s ruling will bring great relief to Savile’s many victims who have been living with the uncertainty of not knowing whether they would be blocked in their claims. They just want some recognition of what they have been through so they can then be able to move on with their lives.' She said women had signed up to the scheme in the hope of receiving “some form of justice” without the need for 'drawn-out and costly litigation'. The scheme would be scrutinised, had checks and balances in place and was not a 'charter for fraudulent claims', she said. Ms Dux said the implications of the costs decision were being analysed. She said she did not know what the costs figure was - but said it would not run into millions of pounds. One of Jimmy Savile's victims has branded the reduced compensation payments as 'absolutely abysmal' and an insult to those who suffered. Former Broadmoor patient Alison Pink, who is now called Steven George after a sex change, was abused by Savile as a 17-year-old as while watching Top Of The Pops. Mr George's share of the compensation has already been halved from £15,000 to £7,500 and he is braced for the sum to be slashed even more. Victim: Steven George, who was a patient at Broadmoor (pictured), branded the reduced compensation payments as 'absolutely abysmal' and an insult to those who suffered . 'We are being penalised because there are so many victims,' said Mr George, 60, who lives in Portsmouth. 'All the court did today was say that the original agreement to pay compensation must continue. 'We are all being rubbished. Our suffering is not being taken seriously. 'People do not appreciate we need this compensation for long term care. Many of these victims are seriously disabled. 'The Government turned a blind eye and did not investigate. Now they arethrowing us to the wolves. They are saying ""Have a few quid and bugger off"".' Mr George said the Government should step in to prop up the process because the sums going to victims were shrinking, and many of them were in NHS care when they were targetted. 'I am not the only victim who had to keep seeing him because they were in hospital,' he said. 'The government originally said they would underwrite this. But I do not see any signs of that at all. 'Jeremy Hunt made this big apology to all the victims as health secretary -then did nothing. 'There are a lot of victims who have been badly let down who need to consider their future car. 'Anyone who was a victim of Savile should be looked after properly. 'I have never even had a written apology.The amounts are absolutely abysmal. It is a bloody insult. Some victims have to pay fortheir own counselling. 'We are being made to feel guilty for asking for compensation by people who do not know what they are talking about. 'I have to think twice before Iput the heating on or have a meal and I just don’t think we should have to do that. 'The Government was partly responsible for Jimmy Savile and for that reason they should damn well look after us.

"It was more than two years ago that Roberto Curti died after a chase and violent struggle with police that saw him tasered multiple times, doused with capsicum spray and knelt on. Following an inquest into his death and a lengthy local court hearing into the matter, Senior Constable Damian John Ralph was the only officer out of three cops to be found guilty of his assault on Tuesday. Shortly after handing down this decision, Magistrate Claire Farnan placed him on a two-year good behaviour bond with no conviction recorded. Officer Damian John Ralph leaves the Downing Centre Court in Sydney. Ralph was the only officer of the four involved to be found found guilty of an assault during the fatal pursuit of Brazilian student Roberto Curti . (L) Daniel David Barling and Scott James Edmondson (R) were both cleared over an alleged assault during the pursuit . Curti, who was living with his sister in Sydney while he studied English, had initially been pursued by officers after stealing two packet of cookies from a convenience store . Ralph's lawyer Roy Hood told the court the serving officer, who has been on restricted duties since December 2013, had been a 'troubled soul' since Mr Curti's death. In finding Ralph guilty of assault on Tuesday, Ms Farnan said the senior constable had used at least two cans of capsicum spray on Mr Curti. It was deployed within 15cm of the 21-year-old's face, while he was lying stomach down and being knelt on by other officers. It is also believed that Curti was tasered by police three times . Curti had initially been pursued by officers in the early hours of March 18, 2012, after stealing two packet of cookies from a convenience store on King St. Police chased him onto Pitt Street, before attempting to subdue him with the taser guns and capsicum spray. Ms Farnan said 'while I accept in the heat of the moment he (Ralph) may have thought it was appropriate ... it's obvious it was not,'. But she found Ralph was a man of good character, who was unlikely to reoffend and suffered from post-traumatic stress as a result of the incident. Disturbing images appear to show police holding the throat of Curti as he was held down and Tasered during the encounter . A lone protester outside the courtroom. Mr Ralph used at least two cans of capsicum spray on Mr Curti during the encounter, deployed within 15cm of the 21-year-old's face .

Ralph, along with his colleague Chin Aun Lim, were charged with Mr Curti's assault, while fellow officers Scott James Edmondson and Daniel David Barling were charged with assault occasioning actual bodily harm. The court heard Mr Curti, who was living with his sister in Sydney while he studied English, became increasingly afraid after taking the drug LSD before his death. When he stole the biscuits, it was incorrectly reported as an armed robbery involving two men. Mr Curti was later spotted by police, shirtless and without shoes. He was tackled twice by police on Pitt Street before being brought to the ground on the third attempt. He died at the scene.","Roberto Curti died after a chase and violent struggle with police in 2012 .

"While most of us like a splosh of the red stuff with our chips, one ketchup obsessive is planning to drown her Christmas dinner in tomato sauce. Samantha Archer, from Harrow, London, has been obsessed with ketchup since she was five years old, and gets through more than a whopping 36 litres of the condiment a year. Ms Archer's two-bottle-a-week habit sees her consuming 700g every fortnight, spending more than £200 a year on various brands. Scroll down for video . Samantha Archer from Harrow has been obsessed with tomato sauce since she was just five years old . The 30-year-old spends more than £200 a year on her habit. She douses all her meals with the red sauce . The 30-year-old spends five minutes dressing her plate each meal time and smothers everything from bread, meat and cheese to eggs, salad and curries with 104 bottles of the sauce a year. Ms Archer said: 'My family just know the deal and they always have a bottle of ketchup for me, they don't want any trouble. Breakfast: Scrambled eggs with tomato ketchup or crumpets with melted cheese and tomato ketchup. Lunch: Pasta salad with ketchup or baked sweet potato with ketchup or ketchup sandwiches. Dinner: Chinese takeaway smothered in ketchup or stew and rice or  chicken curry - all flavoured and topped with ketchup. Snacks: A slice of ham filled with ketchup and folded into parcels or ketchup from a spoon. 'I have ketchup on every meal and my Christmas dinner will be no different - Brussels sprouts and pigs in blankets dripping in ketchup is heaven. 'I am spending Christmas Day with my aunt and she is cooking for me. She always says I won't be able to taste the food she has cooked. 'But I can still taste the flavours - the ketchup just makes it better. 'I have it on absolutely everything, I can't think of anything I don't add it to.' Ms Archer claims her first memory of ketchup dates back to when she was just five after her mum gave her her first taste - and she has been hooked ever since. The financial accountant gets through two bottles of ketchup a week and douses her breakfast, lunch and dinner with her favourite condiment. Ms Archer's friends and family always have bottles of ketchup for her as they 'don't want any trouble' And she is so obsessed with tomato sauce she even eats it straight from a spoon as a quick fix. But she insists it doesn't ruin the taste of her meals and that she can still appreciate all the flavours in the food she eats. She said: 'It takes me five minutes to dress my plate with sauce, I just love it. 'My friends and family are all used to my habits now and they keep a bottle to hand just in case I run out. 'And if they come round to visit they can expect to be fed ketchup. 'If I went out on a date I would warn them that I love tomato sauce - but people can never believe how much I actually put on the plate. They think I am joking. 'I don't know what I would do if I couldn't get my hands on ketchup, I would just have to find some before I could eat. 'I think the only thing I don't add tomato sauce to is soup. But I don't really eat soup - that is probably why.' Tomatoes have long been considered a health super-food. They contain lycopene, an antioxidant associated with a reduced risk of prostate cancer. Some believe it may contribute to the general healthy functioning of the gland, which is integral in sexual function. Lycopene is also known to be a powerful antioxidant, helping to prevent damage to cells in the body. Processed is better than fresh as it means the lycopene is concentrated. The Institute of Nutrition in Jena, Germany, suggests that more than 15mg of lycopene daily may reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease. A typical serving of ketchup supplies 3mg. While this may not sound much, you would have to eat five large slices of watermelon to get the same amount. Dietary fat further aids the absorption of these antioxidants, so chips, occasionally, would be an ideal accompaniment. Ketchup also contains lutein, which offers a small degree of protection for the eyes from macular degeneration. Tests carried by scientists at the University of Oulo in Finland  showed that ketchup could be good for the heart by attacking 'bad' cholesterol, known as low-density lipoprotein. Volunteers who added a few dollops of ketchup to their breakfast, lunch and tea, or drank a few glasses of tomato juice, saw their LDL levels drop significantly in the space of just three weeks. Researchers said total cholesterol levels dropped by just under six per cent and LDL levels by almost 13 per cent. They urged patients with high cholesterol to start eating ketchup or drinking tomato juice to help reduce the risk of heart attacks and strokes. In a report on the findings, published in the British Journal of Nutrition, they said: 'The changes we saw can be regarded as significant, considering that the time period was only three weeks and all the volunteers had normal cholesterol levels to start with.'","Samantha Archer, from Harrow, London eats two bottles of sauce a week .

"A puppy born with deformities in both his front legs has found a new lease of life after being fitted with specially designed 3D-printed prosthetics.

Instead he was taken in by Peace and Paws Dog Rescue, a non-profit dog shelter with a no kill policy in New Hampshire. Scroll down for video . No stopping him now: Derby took to his new prosthetics immediately and he now wears them every day to run two to three miles with his owners . The puppy was born last year with deformities in both his front legs, but has found a new lease of life after being fitted with specially designed 3D-printed prosthetics . Derby was first fostered by Tara Anderson, right, who works for 3D Systems and then during the Summer he was he adopted by Dom and Sherry Portanova, left, in Mechanicsburg, Pennsylvania . In April, Derby was fostered by Tara Anderson, who works for 3D Systems, a South Carolina-based company specializing in 3D printing. Initially Derby was fitted with a cart that allowed him to move with some mobility, but Anderson told BuzzFeed that she wanted to see if she could print prosthetic legs to allow the high-energy dog to run and play more freely. With the help of her colleagues at 3D Systems, she began designing and testing prosthetics for Derby. A CAT scan was taken of his front legs which provided the data needed to turn thousands of layers of 2D photos of Derby’s limbs into the 3D geometry that would then be printed. By June, Derby had been adopted by Dom and Sherry Portanova in Mechanicsburg, Pennsylvania, and Anderson regularly visited them to test out different designs for Derby's new legs. After several experiments, Anderson settled on a design called ‘elbow cups’ and in November Derby tried his new limbs for the first time .

"Police officers could soon be equipped with watch computers, digital glasses and exoskeleton body suits under plans being examined by the Home Office. The Government is looking into a number of ways in which the latest technology can help police maintain national security and catch criminals. Among the gadgets being considered is the widespread use of body cameras and an ultra-light new graphene body armour, whose inventors won the Nobel Prize. Armed police have already been given the latest body armour and weapons, but it emerged today that officers could soon be given computer glasses and watches as well as super-light graphene vests . Google Glass-style eyewear could allow police at busy events to have Twitter flashed up in front of them, while officers responding to 999 calls could access Google maps to work out possible escape routes. Evidence gathered from cameras on bodysuits could also help to secure convictions and build a case against suspects. Forces could also see the use of the exoskeleton suits also being examined by the US Army, which allows users to run faster and walk for longer periods. A version of the suit being developed by the US military allows soldiers to carry up to 200 pounds for more than 12 miles on a single battery charge. It also allows them to run at 7 mph for extended periods and even has a 'burst mode' that takes the run into a 10 mph sprint for short periods. The plans for the new technology emerged as the Home Office unveiled its new Security and Innovation Centre (SIDC), where scientists will work on ways to better equip and arm police officers. From next month, the centre will work on 'developing the digital police officer', the Home Office stated. It described the project as 'enabling officers to use technology such as body-worn video, wearable mobile data and head-up displays to improve information gathering and sharing'. Among the gadgets being considered is greater use of body cameras fitted to officers helmets or vests . Exoskeleton suits like used being developed by the US military could also be used by police in future . Police forces could also use Google Glass-style eyewear to monitor Twitter and the internet while on the beat . It will also work on improving drug and explosive detection tools and finding ways of better tracking organised criminals using the internet. Karen Bradley, Minister for Organised Crime, said: 'I’m delighted to launch the Security Innovation and Demonstration Centre – a hub that allows government, industry, academia and of course practitioners, such as the police, to identify security challenges and create innovative solutions to tackle them. 'We already have a strong and thriving security industry and I am committed to supporting it to ensure it stays at the forefront of the global market and at the same time contributes to the safety and security of the UK.' The technology being examined was revealed in a secret presentation given by the director of Home Office's Centre for Applied Science and Technology, Rob Coleman, which emerged after a freedom of information request by the Guardian. But the prospect of even better equipped police officers has raised fears among some former officers. Former police inspector Colin Rogers told the newspaper: 'There has been a problem, perhaps, with some forces in that they are beginning to look almost paramilitary. That, I think, is not conducive to good community engagement.' Computer watches, like these being unveiled by Apple earlier this year, could also be given to police officers .

"It runs to more than 3,000 lines of verse and is the longest epic poem in Old English. Now, Beowulf - which documents the eponymous hero's battles with a monster and a dragon - will be made into a 13-part drama for ITV, the broadcaster has confirmed. The cast is yet to be revealed, but the series - described as a ‘Western set in the Dark Ages of Britain's mythic past’ - will be filmed ‘amongst the breathtaking beauty of England's North East’. Scroll down for trailer . Computer animation: A film called Beowulf, inspired by the poem, was released in 2007 starring the likes of Ray Winstone, Anthony Hopkins and Angelina Jolie . Links between the poem and Game of Thrones have previously been suggested, with character Jon Snow - played by actor Kit Harington in the HBO drama - compared to Beowulf himself. In the new drama, the broadcaster has promised ‘epic fights, thrilling chases, raids, celebrations and battles’ - and it will be filmed from April next year in County Durham and Northumberland. An ITV spokesman said: ‘Beowulf is a series about courage, greed, betrayal, revenge, loyalty, power, man versus wilderness and, of course, love. It is a series that explores the notion of good and evil, heroes and villains. ‘However, beyond these wider political undercurrents and inner personal turmoils are the excitement, danger and sense of adventure that any great Western has.’ Runs to more than 3,000 lines: Beowulf is one of the most famous works of Anglo-Saxon poetry, and its only known manuscript is held at the British Library in London, dating back about 1,000 years . The series is set in Shieldlands, a mythical area populated by both humans and fantasy creatures. The first episode will see Beowulf return to Herot to pay his respects to a man who raised him. But Herot is then attacked by the monster Grendel, leading Beowulf to hunt it down. The announcement comes after ITV unveiled a string of period dramas - such as The Frankenstein Chronicles, starring Sean Bean, and Jekyll & Hyde, set in 1930s London. Beowulf writer and executive producer James Dormer said: ‘Hundreds of years ago our ancestors listened to the story of Beowulf because it was a great adventure story. It scared them, thrilled them, made them laugh and cry. 'But they also listened because they recognised themselves and their fears in it. By holding a mirror up to them this story helped define them, and thus - us.

During the event, he also told the 70-strong crowd that Mr Balls and Labour leader Ed Miliband were the 'Thelma and Louise of British politics'. During a Tory fundraiser in Nottingham, East Midlands, Boris Johnson (right) told the crowd that shadow chancellor Ed Balls (left) had the 'pop-eyed air of a man undergoing an unexpected prostate examination' He told the bemused crowd: 'The Thelma and Louise of British politics, Ed Miliband and Ed Balls. 'Does anybody really want to give them back keys to the British economy? 'Do you? Do you want Ed Miliband in charge when frankly he doesn't know. 'He's a stupefying man. 'Do you want Ed Balls in charge of the economy with his unbelievably hostile attitude towards wealth creation and the terrible, pop-eyed air of a man undergoing an unexpected prostate examination? 'Is that what you want? Do you want these guys in charge? 'I don't want them in charge.' The Conservative was in the East Midlands last Thursday to host fundraisers for prospective Nottingham South candidate Jane Hunt, and also for Sherwood MP Mark Spencer. Elliot Johnson, Nottingham University Conservative Association campaigns officer, was at the presentation at the city's Goosedale conference and banqueting suites, and said Mr Johnson was better than any stand-up comedian. The 21-year-old third-year history student said: 'He gave such a fantastic speech. The London Mayor also described Mr Balls and Labour leader Ed Miliband (above) as the 'Thelma and Louise of British politics' and asked: 'Does anybody really want to give them back keys to the British economy?' 'There were some really funny lines, especially the finger up the bum part. He is a very very good orator. Boris can just get away with saying stuff that nobody else can. 'Afterwards, about 70 people gave him a standing ovation for more than a minute-and-a-half. 'He's the best public speaker I've ever seen.' It is also understood that Mr Johnson quipped that, since London will soon become the fourth-biggest 'French' city in the world - due to a huge number of French people living there - it is in danger of being invaded by Germany. According to student newspaper The Tab, he said: 'We're bigger than Nantes, We're bigger than Strasbourg, if it goes much longer like this we'll have to worry about a German invasion. 'We even have a family of Huguenot refugees from France living in Dulwich, called Monsieur and Madame Farage.' The Labour Party and the Conservative Party both refused to comment on Mr Johnson's speech.","Boris Johnson made unusual comments at Conservative party fundraiser .

"Managing director Graham Mackereth and electrical engineer Paul Keddie have been cleared of health and safety breaches after Alan Catterall (above) was burnt to death at a factory in Runcorn,  Cheshire . Two businessman on trial over the death of a worker who was accidentally trapped inside an industrial oven by his future son-on-law have had the case against them dropped – but their company still faces corporate manslaughter charges. Managing director Graham Mackereth and electrical engineer Paul Keddie have been cleared of breaching health and safety regulations after father-of-three Alan Catterall, 54, was burnt to death at a kayak factory in Runcorn, Cheshire. Mr Catterall, a grandfather, had gone into the oven to fix a fault when operator Mark Francis, not realising he was still working inside, switched the machine on and locked him in. Mr Francis was engaged to Mr Catterall's eldest daughter. A judge at Liverpool Crown Court today agreed there was no case to answer against Mr Keddie and Mr Mackereth, 64, and the pair were discharged from court. However, their company Pyranha Mouldings continues to face a corporate manslaughter charge and oven designer Peter Mackereth, 59, from Llangollen, Wales, faces a charge of breaching health and safety laws. The court heard today that prosecuting QC Andrew Thomas had conceded  the evidence against Graham Mackereth was insufficient for a conviction. He opposed the application involving Mr Keddie, who designed the electrics and electronic systems for the oven, but the judge, Mr Justice Macduff, ruled there was no case to answer. He said that Mr Keddie had designed the systems for the oven according to Pyranha's brief and therefore couldn't be held accountable for how they were used. The judge added: 'There is no evidence that any danger was due to his undertaking'. During the trial, which began almost a month ago, the court heard how no one had realised Mr Catterall was inside the oven on December 23, 2010, until smoke started seeping out and the 'horrific' circumstances of his death were discovered. A jury heard how the huge oven had been switched off for an hour after a fault developed and, after it was fixed, it was switched on by Mr Francis. As it was switched on, the doors automatically shut and locked with metal pins which dropped into place on the outside. Mr Catterall was trapped within the oven with no means of escape and no means of raising the alarm. Mr Thomas told jurors: 'After a preparation cycle lasting several minutes, the burners were turned on and the oven was raised to operating temperature. 'The evidence indicates that Mr Catterall made efforts to escape using a metal crowbar but it was to no avail. He suffered severe burns and died as a result of shock. Pyranha Mouldings Ltd in Runcorn, Cheshire (pictured), continues to face a corporate manslaughter charge and oven designer Peter Mackereth, 59, from Wales, faces one charge of breaching health and safety laws . 'The first anyone knew about the problem was when smoke started seeping out of the oven.' Rotational moulding expert Dr Paul Nugent gave evidence at yesterday's court hearing after inspecting the company's machines. He told the court that there weren't 'any of these machines in the world which have safety exit panels or any means of exit from inside.' An investigation by Cheshire Police and the Health and Safety Executive found the oven had been designed by Pyranha Mouldings and said the company was responsible for safety. The prosecutor alleged today that investigations later found there was no written procedure of any kind, no manual of operation, no written training record and no warning sign at the factory. Mr Catterall grew up in Liverpool and worked at a tyre factory in Speke before joining the Ford factory in Halewood where he worked for many years. He joined Pyranha in 1997 and was promoted to team leader at the company, which had between 90 and 100 employees including his wife of 34 years and daughter. The case continues.

"Lucas Wieweck led police on a car chase through central Phoenix before crashing and trying to flee . This disturbing police mug shot shows the face of 26-year-old Lucas Wieweck, who was arrested in Phoenix, Arizona, after being caught speeding across town in a stolen car with a young family inside. A woman believed to be the  mother of the children, aged between two and four, was also in the car, according to AZCentral.com . In the shot a heavily tattooed Wieweck’s left eye is swollen and closed and his right is barely open as he grimaces at the camera. The suspect sports ink across the whole of the lower half of his face below his eyes, and over his forehead below the hairline. By the time police caught up with him he had ploughed into other cars, sped through red lights and tried to run from officers. At about 4.30pm on Sunday the vehicle’s owner rang police to say three people, one of whom was Wieweck, had beaten him and stolen the keys to his car near 31st Street and Virginia Avenue near central Phoenix. The caller claimed he managed to break free when the trio tried to lead him back to the car for what he feared would be a drive into the desert where he would be killed. Two hours later the stolen vehicle was seen by officers on McDowell Road near 3rd Avenue travelling eastbound with Wieweck driving. When a police car approached him, he reportedly switched lanes and hit three other cars as he sped through Central Avenue. He then smashed into a traffic light at up to 40mph after trying to speed through a busy intersection on 24th Street, according to court documents. Wieweck was caught around 50 yards away having fled on foot, leaving his four passengers behind, the police report shows. It is not clear how they came to be in the car. Wieweck was arrested on suspicion of armed robbery, unlawful flight from police, endangerment and child-abuse.

"A medical student at King’s College became so distraught after she failed her exams that she attacked a classmate and then threw herself under a train. Anita Trivedi, 23, died after she flung herself in front of a freight train that was travelling through a Southeast London station, near the medical school's campus. An inquest heard how Trivedi, from Newham, east London, had to resit her fourth year at medical school and was suffering from mood swings, eating problems, and hair loss. Death: Anita Trivedi, 23, from Newham, east London, was killed after she flung herself under a freight train that was travelling through a Southeast London station, near the medical school's campus . According to eyewitnesses, her anger spilled over on the day that she died and she assaulted one of her classmates, who she barely knew, in the college toilets during a break between lectures. The victim, who cannot be named for legal reasons, said Anita lunged at her for no reason after she asked if she was okay. The pair had only spoken on one other occasion at another lecture and the witness described Anita as ‘normal and happy’ the first time they met. But a few days later she launched an unprovoked attack against the girl in the bathroom, Southwark Coroner’s Court heard. The witness said: ‘I had gone to the toilet and as I was washing my hands I noticed another student to the right of me. Anita walked in and didn’t use the toilet. ‘She stood there for a bit and was staring and looked very distressed and was breathing very heavily.It was one of the scariest things I’ve ever seen. It looked really scary. 'She was just staring at herself in the mirror. She had a blank expression, almost as if she wasn’t there in that moment. ‘She just wasn’t the person I had met two days before. She just stared for what felt like ages. I felt bad and asked her if she was OK. ‘She turned her head towards me and just lunged at me and started attacking me.She put her right fist out and started to attempt to punch me and I kept putting my hands out to stop. ‘Then she hit me really hard on the left side of my head. I bent over the sink because I would have fallen over if I hadn’t put my hands out. ‘I screamed ‘help’ and she ran out. She said nothing. We both tried to stop her [attacking] but she was too strong for both of us. We were just screaming.’ Kings College, Cambridge: The medical student was studying at King’s College, pictured here, and became distraught and angry after she had to  resit her fourth year . The student added: ‘I couldn't think of any reason she would hit me so it made me think there was something really wrong with her at the time. ‘The other student asked if I was OK and I said I was fine and we need to find Anita.The college asked me if I wanted to press charges and I said no because she was clearly unwell. ‘I thought she needed help.’ Another classmate, who also cannot be named, told the inquest: ‘She looked very distressed and was just staring at herself in the mirror not washing her hands or doing anything, just staring looking at her own reflection. ‘She looked strange like something was troubling her. I would describe her as a bit wild, she had big wide open eyes and a strange expression. She continued: ‘I heard the other girl say ‘Anita are you OK’ it seemed natural I didn’t know the girl myself or that they knew each other or what their relationship was. ‘Then Anita went behind my back and grabbed the girl with one hand and started hitting her with with other. I tried to put my hands between the two of them to try and make her stop. ‘When I got close it didn’t take very long before Anita ran out. It seemed like she was in a trance and it broke the trance and came out of it and came back to the room. She continued: ‘I was quite concerned for Anita. It felt like a matter of urgency because she was running out, I felt she was in a bad state and wanted someone to go after her.’ Both students reported the incident to college security. However, Anita was believed to be upset about having to repeat a year but her father and tutors had reassured her that failing a year was relatively common among medical students. Friend Darena Dineva described Anita as ‘very hard working’ and said she struggled to accept that she had failed her exams. ‘I also failed my fourth year and am resitting this year,’ she said in a statement read at the inquest. 'We were paired together as clinical partners. I had known Anita for three years and was her friend, she was a very private person. ‘She had lost her half-sister and grandmother in the last year and said she find it hard to study because of the loss of her family members. ‘She wanted time and space, she was a difficult person who didn’t open up and found it difficult to accept she had failed.’ She added: ‘We got the results from the exams on 16 July and after that she wouldn’t pick up the phone to anyone. ‘I wasn’t aware of any real problems she had. ‘I heard about the fight through the grapevine and it seemed totally out of character for her and I don’t know why this would happen. ‘If she was being bullied she didn’t mention it and I wasn’t aware of any bulling at Kings. I don’t think she was being bullied. ‘She was such a quiet person. She was a very nice person but I didn’t know her very well.’ Dr Tunji Lasoye, a consultant at Kings Hospital, described Anita as a ‘soft spoken, intelligent and articulate’ student. Anita’s father, Kailash Trivedi, a general practitioner, said his daughter had seemed happy despite repeating a year after failing a set of exams. ‘She was beautiful, very pretty, she cared for everybody, she always remembered birthdays and Father’s Day and Mother’s Day. She was everything,’ he said shortly after her death. ‘She was so good, so nice, so polite, so courteous. I miss her so much.’ One of her brothers said Anita had changed in the last year and was suffering from mood swings, the inquest was told. PC Sally Ramsden-Mallin said in a statement: ‘Her sibling said Anita had stopped believing in religion.’ ‘One minute she was eating nothing the next minute eating junk food. She had mood swings, one minute very happy and the next sad and depressed.’ Anita was also losing her jet black hair, the inquest was told. Train driver Chris Cockburn said in a statement read at the inquest that he noticed a person walking on the tracks near the station that afternoon. He added that when the person took ‘two noticeable steps’ towards the tracks he applied the emergency brakes and sounded the horn. ‘The person then did a forward dive into the track in front of me,’ he continued. 'The train was coming to a stop and I was able to see the person lying on the track. The person made no attempt to get up off the track. ‘When the train came to a halt 250 foot after the impact with the person and could not have stopped in time. It seemed to me this was a deliberate act.’ A number of eyewitnesses saw Anita jump into the path of the oncoming train, the inquest heard. One bystander Ayyaz Iqbal said he saw a woman dive under the train. He said: The female held out her arms in front of her and dived in front of the oncoming train. She was looking at the train when she dived.’ She was pronounced dead at the scene. A King’s College spokesperson said: ‘Our thoughts and deepest sympathies are with her family and friends and we continue to liaise with the coroner’s office.’ The hearing continues.

"House prices soared by 10.4 per cent in the past year, official figures revealed this morning. The continuing boom was fuelled by runaway prices in London, with homes in the capital £70,000 more expensive last month than at the same time last year – a 17.2 per cent increase in just 12 months. Excluding the capital and the wider South East, house prices increased by 6.7 per cent across the rest of the country, the Office for National Statistics said. Prices grew 10.8 per cent in England, 5.7 per cent in Wales, 4.9 per cent in Scotland and 4.9 per cent in Northern Ireland. In England, prices grew fastest in the South East and East Anglia – up 11.9 per cent and 9.6 per cent respectively. The booming property market is making it increasingly difficult for first-time buyers to get on their foot on the housing ladder. In October, prices paid by first-time buyers were 12 per cent higher on average than at the same time the year before. For existing owners prices increased by 9.7 per cent. By last month, first time buyers had to pay £208,000 to get on the ladder – while the average price paid by owner-occupiers was £312,000. The average UK house price in October was £271,000 – with properties in England the most expensive at £283,000. Homes in Wales cost £172,000 on average, £194,000 in Scotland and £137,000 in Northern Ireland. In London meanwhile the average house costs £504,000 – almost three and a half times more than in the North East which has the lowest average house prices at £152,000. London, the South East and the East all had prices higher than the UK average price of £271,000.

"Thousands of British skiers hoping for an idyllic winter getaway are facing disappointment as French forecasters warn there will be no snow in the Alps until January at the earliest. Yann Giezendanner, an expert in mountain weather who works for French forecaster Meteo France, predicts there will be only 'crumbs' of snow in the region for at least the next two weeks. In a online weather update he adds that there has been no 'season starting' snow dump because all the bad weather has hit the UK and Scandinavia instead. Scroll down for video . Thousands of British skiers hoping for a winter getaway as the school holidays kick off this weekend are facing disappointment as Alps slopes have been left without snow (pictured, Villard-de-Lans today) Yann Giezendanner, who has worked for forecaster Meteo France for 35 years, has predicted there will be no 'snow dump' over much of the Alps until January, leaving holidaymakers in the lurch (pictured, La Clusaz) This was the scene in Villard-de-Lans today as resort owners have been forced to delay the start of the season after high pressure and unseasonably warm weather stopped snow from falling . Experts have noted that, so far this winter, there had been more snow in Scotland than in the Alps. The dire prediction comes ahead of a winter getaway this weekend at the start of the school holidays as 80,00 Britons are expected to head to the Alps in the next two weeks, according to the Crystal Ski Report. Some resorts have already closed slopes and canceled events because of a lack of snow. Webcams in the alpine resort of La Clusaz show only a thin covering of snow on the largely muddy, grassy ground, while officials there were forced to cancel the cross country skiing World Cup. The event, which was due to be held at La Clusaz last week, was instead moved to Davos in Switzerland, where the snow is deeper. Pierre Lestas, who manages ski lifts at the winter retreat, told The Times: 'At the moment we don't have enough snow to open the slops. We need another 20cm.' Meanwhile at Villard-de-Lans resort, slopes director Didier Beuque admitted that there was not enough snow to provide 'quality holidays', adding that the situation was 'very worrying'. Officials at La Clusaz were forced to cancel the cross country skiing World Cup last weekend due to a lack of snow (pictured, the snowless village square in La Clusaz which is at low altitude) As well as problems at Villard-de-Lans (pictured), Chamonix Mont-Blanc has been forced to close, while just a single piste was open yesterday in the hugley popular resort of Les Arcs . Neither location is predicted to get more than 6cm of snow between now and Christmas day, according to data on weather-forecast.com. Val d’Isère, normally one of the most reliable resorts in Europe for snow, also cancelled the men’s World Cup giant slalom and slalom races last weekend. That is despite having invested in the largest snow-making machine in Europe, as these require air temperatures of -6C to work. Temperatures on the first weekend of December reached 5C. In La Rosiere locals have said it is the worst start to a season  since 1962, while problems have also been reported at the hugely popular resort of Les Arcs. The tourist retreat, which is made up of four camps at varying altitudes, comprises half of the giant Paradiski skiing domain. The Chamonix Mont-Blanc resort (pictured) is currently closed due to lack of snow, while the website says it may open this weekend 'depending on snow cover' Webcams at the top of a ski lift 2000ft up the side of Mont Blanc captured these images today, showing a very thin coating of snow on the ground . But yesterday there was only one ski lift and one 0.6mile (1km) piste open at the highest altitude while the resort’s daily ski report said the nearest fresh snow fell 77 miles (124km) away. Ski instructor Philippe Arnauld said: ‘At the moment it is just about okay because the start of the season is never that busy, but from next weekend the resorts will be full for Christmas and New Year. ‘If all the ski schools and the holiday making families have only two lifts between them it is going to be chaos and a catastrophe - and no significant snowfall, perhaps only a few snowflakes, is predicted between now and Christmas. I have no idea what will happen and how we will manage.’ Also badly affected is Chamonix Mont-Blanc which was unable to open last weekend due to lack of snow, and according to its website may open this weekend 'depending on snow cover'. Elsewhere, other resorts only opened a fraction of pistes on higher slopes, including a third of the 154 slopes at Tignes, 11 out of 137 at La Plagne and eight out of 95 at Courchevel. Yann Giezendanner predicts there will only be 'crumbs' of snow over the Alps until the New Year at the earliest, as all the wet weather is hitting the UK and Scandinavia instead .","Lack of snow has closed slopes and led to events being cancelled in Alps .

Case: Jefferson (seen in court earlier this year) and Batiste were arrested following the incident on February 8 this year and charged with felony child endangerment. They both later pleaded guilty to the charge . During a police interview, Batiste reportedly admitted she had given Jefferson's daughter some of her drink at the apartment at Inwood Village complex in the 7200 block of TC Jester, near Antoine. She estimated the 23-month-old had consumed around half of her beverage - roughly six shots of vodka - before falling asleep. Police also noted Batiste 'laughed' when speaking about the incident. When the girl was taken to hospital, she was apparently swaying and smelled strongly of alcohol, according to KPRC. She has since recovered. The toddler and two other children are now in the care of a relative.

"Spanish and Moroccan police have swooped on a terror group which recruits women for ISIS, arresting seven suspected members in raids across both countries. A statement by the Spanish interior ministry said four women, including one minor, were detained in the Spanish enclaves of Ceuta and Melilla, and a male suspect was arrested in the mainland city of Barcelona. Moroccan authorities picked up two suspected male heads of the group in Castillejos – a town in Morocco near Ceuta, which is known in Arabic as Fnideq. Scroll down for video . Spanish National Police footage shows a veiled woman being arrested by Spanish police . A hooded man and woman in a full veil are detained on suspicion of being part of a terror group . The cell was in contact with Moroccan commanders fighting with Islamic State who are feared to be planning attacks in the kingdom as well, added the Moroccan statement. Both Spain and Morocco have arrested dozens of suspect jihadi militants and recruiters in recent years, with networks centred around northern Morocco and the Spanish enclaves. Women are brought from Spain to north Africa and indoctrinated with jihadist theories. European authorities have noticed a sharp increase in the recruitment of women from Europe for Islamic State in the past year, with at least 100 coming from France alone. The women were to be used as suicide bombers or married off to jihadi fighters, said the Moroccan statement. Accounts from the areas under Islamic State control in Syria describe large numbers of foreign women working as cooks, cleaners and in child care. European officials say these networks, many of which operate online, target young people in search of their identity with the aim of planting multi-generational roots for an Islamic caliphate. There are more than 1,200 Moroccans reportedly fighting in Syria, and more than 100 have been arrested upon their return. In July, Morocco sounded the alarm over the threat of terrorist attacks from those returning from Syria and Iraq and boosted security in public places. Seven people were arrested for allegedly using the internet to recruit young women for ISIS .

"Killer: Marcel Arava, 49, had already ‘illegally’ slipped into the UK when he was convicted in his absence and handed 12 years’ jail time for murder by a Romanian court in 2002 . A Romanian killer entered Britain ‘unlawfully’ and stayed for more than a decade while he should have been serving a jail term in his homeland, a court heard yesterday. Marcel Arava, 49, had already ‘illegally’ slipped into the UK when he was convicted in his absence and handed 12 years’ jail time for murder by a Romanian court in 2002. Despite his claim for asylum being refused, Arava remained in Britain and raised a family before he was arrested outside his south London home in June. The case will heighten calls for tighter immigration controls on European Union offenders settling in Britain, sparked when convicted Latvian murderer Arnis Zalkalns was named as prime suspect in the killing of London teenager Alice Gross. Yesterday, a judge at London’s High Court rejected Arava’s bid for bail in the UK while he awaits a hearing for his extradition to Romania, saying he is a serious ‘flight risk’. Mr Justice Holroyde said Arava was first arrested in Romania over the alleged murder in 1990. The precise details of the offence were not given in court, but the Metropolitan Police have since confirmed it relates to a 1989 killing. Arava was released without charge before he moved to the United States in 1991, entering illegally and being granted asylum before he was tried and convicted of the murder in Romania in his absence, the judge said. However, the conviction was quashed on appeal in 1994 and Arava returned to Romania for a number of years, before he left for UK shores in 1998. ‘He entered the country illegally. Arava made a claim for asylum, which failed,’ the judge said. ‘He nonetheless remained in the UK with his wife and, over the years which passed since then, three children have been born to them.’ Immigration controls on EU offenders settling in Britain: Earlier this year, convicted Latvian murderer Arnis Zalkalns (left) was named as prime suspect in the killing of London teenager Alice Gross (right) Decision: A judge at London’s High Court (pictured) rejected Arava’s bid for bail in the UK while he awaits a hearing for his extradition to Romania, saying he is a serious 'flight risk' In 2000, Arava was again convicted of the 1989 murder in his absence in Romania and sentenced to 12 years behind bars in 2002. His guilt was later upheld by the country’s Appeal Court and Supreme Court. Arava, however, insists he is entirely innocent and claims that he was completely unaware of both his fresh conviction and his unsuccessful appeals, the judge said. An arrest warrant was issued by the authorities in Constanta, Romania, in March and he was arrested on June 10 outside his family home in Croydon, after the National Crime Agency was alerted to his presence. Arava gave officers the same false name he had used when he was arrested by British cops in 2003 in an incident that led to his conviction for driving with excess alcohol — his sole criminal offence in the UK. Tory MP: Angie Bray (above) has said the EU must 'make it compulsory for member states to maintain an up-to-date EU register of all criminal conviction' The killer is now facing a hearing in January over his proposed extradition to Romania so that he can serve his prison sentence, Mr Justice Holroyde said. Arava’s legal team argued there were ‘serious matters’ standing in the way of him being sent to Romania, including the delay in his criminal proceedings, the safety of him being convicted in his absence and prison conditions in Romania. Applying for bail in the mean time, Arava’s counsel, Daniel Jones, argued that he was unlikely to abscond, given his ‘strong family ties’ here and his wish to robustly resist his extradition. Arguing that Arava gave a false name to police purely out of ‘panic’, the barrister explained that his friends had raised £15,000 to put up as security for his bail. But Mr Justice Holroyde said: ‘The giving of a false name when confronted by the police and the fact that name was given on a previous encounter with the police are significant factors. ‘So too is the fact that a number of years ago he entered the US unlawfully and that, some years later, he entered this country unlawfully. ‘No doubt Arava wishes to stay with his family, but that, in my judgment, does not mean that he is not a flight risk.’ He concluded: ‘In these circumstances, I am satisfied that there is substantial risk here that, if granted bail, Arava would not surrender to that bail, given the extradition hearing in January. ‘This application fails and is refused.’ Fears over EU criminals moving to Britain were sparked in September when Arnis Zalkans, who had served a jail term for killing his wife in Latvia, was first sought by police over missing schoolgirl, Alice Gross. The 41-year-old from west London was found hanged in woods in Boston Manor Park, Hounslow, in October, days after Alice’s lifeless body was discovered just a 20-minute walk away. Tory MP Angie Bray said at the time: ‘The EU needs to make it compulsory for member states to maintain an up-to-date EU register of all criminal convictions so that anyone coming here can easily be identified if they have a criminal conviction.’","Marcel Arava had already 'illegally' slipped into Britain when convicted .

"Ukip is set to secure a £1.5 million pot of taxpayers' cash by forming a new European-wide political party. The funding follows the formation of the Alliance for Direct Democracy in Europe, a pan-European political party which is dominated by Ukip. East Midlands Ukip MEP Roger Helmer said if the Eurosceptic party did not take the money it would go to ‘integrationist organisations’ promoting ever-close union. Ukip leader Nigel Farage has formed a new Alliance for Direct Democracy in Europe to secure taxpayer funding . But the decision has sparked a fresh row within the party – with some MEPs fiercely opposed to taking the Brussels funds. MEP Gerard Batten said there had been no consultation with members, adding: ‘I think the feeling among the activists is that they won't be in favour of it.’ According to BBC2's Newsnight, the new party could be approved by the European Parliament later this week, with the funding - which could be used on research, administration and advertising, but not for the UK general election campaign - following in April next year. The new party, currently made up mostly of Ukip MEPs, is entitled to £1m of European Union funding next year, Newsnight reported. An accompanying foundation, called the Initiative for Direct Democracy in Europe, will support ADDE and is entitled to a grant of £580,000. Mr Helmer told the programme the money could otherwise be available to ‘the German or other foundations which promote further integration’. He said: ‘We are going to be criticised by those who say 'you should turn your back on this money, you should take a principled stand and refuse it'. ‘But it doesn't make any difference to the taxpayer. ‘If we don't take the money, it will not go back to the member state of the taxpayer. It will simply go to those other foundations committed to further European integration.’ Socialist MEP Martin Schulz (left) is the president of the European Parliament, while Jean-Claude Juncker (right) is president of the Commission . He added: ‘We think that if there are resources available, we want to get them. ‘So the question for any Ukip supporter who has a reasonable issue here is - would you rather this money, which is British taxpayers' money, would you rather this money was given to one of the German or other foundations which promote further European integration, or would you rather some of the money goes to us to oppose European integration? ‘We are doing it precisely so we can liberate some of that money that would otherwise go to integrationist organisations.’ But Mr Batten said Ukip had rejected the idea of creating a new party, which is a different organisation from the Europe of Freedom and Direct Democracy political grouping formed by Nigel Farage and his allies in the European Parliament. Mr Batten told Newsnight: ‘I'm not interested in being part of a European political party. The members of Ukip weren't asked. There's been no consultation.’ MEP Roger Helmer said the money  would go to ‘integrationist organisations’ if Ukip did not take it . The idea was rejected in 2011 following an ‘expensive’ referendum,’ he said. ‘I can't think of any arguments that would make me want to join. I think the feeling among the activists is that they won't be in favour of it.’ Tim Congdom, who ran against Mr Farage for the party's leadership in 2010 and led the internal referendum campaign opposed to forming a Pepp, said: ‘In 2011 Ukip held a big internal debate on the issue. ‘The party membership voted two to one against Ukip's affiliation to a Pepp.’That was the clear and unambiguous democratic verdict of the party membership after a big debate extending over several months. ‘I am much saddened that the leadership should now have decided to ignore and overrule the clearly expressed view of the party membership.’ It is understood that that party's ruling National Executive Committee backed the decision, giving individual Ukip MEPs the choice of whether to sign up. All but two of the party's 24 MEPs are expected to be on board, with just Mr Batten and Julia Reid opposed to the move, a Ukip source in Brussels said. The news comes after a chaotic few days for Ukip, which saw Kerry Smith quit as a candidate in a top target seat after being forced to apologise for a series of offensive comments. In recordings of phone calls obtained by the Mail on Sunday, the would-be MP was said to have mocked gay party members as ‘poofters’, joked about shooting people from Chigwell in a ‘peasant hunt’ and referred to someone as a ‘Chinky bird’. They were revealed just days after he was reinstated as the party's general election candidate in South Basildon and East Thurrock. He initially apologised and explained that he had been under great stress at the time of the comments and taking strong pain killers. But in a statement, he said: ‘I have this evening offered my resignation as Ukip PPC (prospective parliamentary candidate) for South Basildon and East Thurrock. ‘I want the best for South Basildon and East Thurrock and I want to see the real issues discussed that touch the lives of people. ‘Therefore I have chosen to resign so that Ukip can win this seat next May.’","Funding follows formation of the Alliance for Direct Democracy in Europe .

"American nuns are a 'dying breed'  an in-depth Vatican study has confirmed, prompting concern within the religious community. The results of a three-year-long investigation released in Rome on Tuesday, told how the current workforce stands at 50,000 compared to 175,000 in the mid-sixties. And on top of that, the average age of Roman Catholic sisters is mid-to late 70, with few young women stepping in to replace them. Dwindling numbers: A Vatican report has confirmed fears among the religious community that nuns in the U.S. are a 'dying breed' - here two sisters leave the Vatican after the findings were announced Tuesday . Vatican researchers sent questionnaires and conducted 'sister-to-sister' dialogues at 341 Catholic institutions across the U.S. between 2009 and 2012. Among the topics of focus were numbers and mission, prayer schedules, living arrangements, financial assets and property. 'Many sisters expressed great concern . . . for the continuation of their charism and mission, because of the numerical decline in their membership,' the report on the Apostolic Visitation of Institutes of Religious Women in the United States of America said. The paper is the result of an investigation launched after some Vatican officials and U.S. bishops voiced concerns over the nuns. One official suggested they had been infiltrated by 'radical feminism'. The inquiry, begun during the papacy of former Pope Benedict XVI. However, Tuesday's overwhelmingly positive 12-page report was cheered by the sisters themselves, dozens of whom swarmed the news conference announcing the results in a rare moment of women outnumbering men at the Vatican. Sister Sharon Holland, who currently heads the Leadership Conference of Women Religious, acknowledged that the investigation was initially met with apprehension and distrust, particularly among elderly sisters who 'felt that their whole lives had been judged and found wanting.' But she said the results showed that the Vatican had listened and heard what the sisters had to say. 'There is an encouraging and realistic tone in this report,' she told the news conference. 'Challenges are understood, but it is not a document of blame, or of simplistic solutions. One can read the text and feel appreciated and trusted to carry on.' Asked if the change in tone from the start of the process to the end was a reflection of Pope Francis' leadership, Holland said 'I'm willing to give him all sorts of credit.' 'I don't know how to assess entirely his influence in all of this, but he's been a great encouragement and hope to a lot of us,' she said. The Vatican officials had suggested some nuns did not fully espouse Church teachings against abortion and homosexuality and that some had become too involved in political issues. On a good note: The Vatican went out of its way to mend fences with American religious sisters, thanking them for their selfless work caring for the poor, gently suggesting ways to survive amid a decline in numbers . But Tuesday's report made no reference to any specific criticism and did not dwell on the controversy over the investigation. It said U.S. orders of nuns 'should carefully review their spiritual practices and ministry to assure that these are in harmony with Catholic teaching' and urged them not to 'displace Christ' while going about their social work. But it also praised them for 'selflessly tending to the spiritual, moral, educational, physical and social needs of countless individuals, especially the poor and marginalized'. The report acknowledged that a number of nuns had expressed the need for greater recognition of the role nuns play in the Church and felt women should have more input into decisions that affect them. Pope Francis, who met a delegation of U.S. nuns on Tuesday, has promised to appoint women to decision-making roles in the Vatican. The Nun Justice Project, a U.S. group which organized demonstrations to defend the nuns, said the investigation had been a waste of time. '(The nuns) had to divert precious resources away from ministries to the marginalized just so Rome could discover what Catholics have known all along: U.S. women religious are among the most inspiring and faithful of Catholics,' it said.","Crowds gathered in Rome on Tuesday for the results of a three-year-long investigation into American nuns .

"The owner of a Smart car who was fined for parking at a right angle to the kerb has had the penalty overturned – after claiming it was recommended by the manufacturer. Vanessa Price, 44, was issued the ticket when she squeezed into an on-street parking bay. Although the ability of Smart cars, which are less than 9ft long, to fit into small spaces at right angles to the pavement is well known – and a unique selling point – the traffic warden insisted that the front of the car overlapped the white bay markings, leaving it illegally parked. Vanessa Price, 44, was issued a £50 fine after she parked at a right-angle in Stroud, Gloucestershire (above). The traffic warden issued the fine after insisting the car overlapped the white bay markings, making it illegal . He issued a £50 fine, which Mrs Price, who regularly positions her car in the unorthodox fashion, fiercely contested. The business owner finally had her ticket overturned last month after a year-long battle. Mrs Price, from Stroud, Gloucestershire, said at the time she was ticketed: ‘I have parked like this in Stroud, London and Bristol and never had any trouble before. According to the Code of Practice on Civil Parking and Traffic Enforcement, at least one wheel needs to be wholly outside the markings of the bay. This applies except in cases where a long vehicle overhang is causing an obstruction or preventing another vehicle from parking in an adjacent bay. ‘If you go to the Smart website they show you pictures of their cars parked in this way.’ Smart, whose cars were first sold in the UK in 2000, says ‘urban mobility’ is at the heart of every car it designs and drivers can fit into spaces others reject on sight. Its website reads: ‘The Smart comes into its own in the most compact of spaces. So before you seek out the nearest car park, why not park right where you need to be?’ Mrs Price won her battle at a parking penalty tribunal after the adjudicator said she had not breached any traffic regulation order by leaving her car as she did. ‘It was a ridiculous process and there were no winners in the end,’ she said. ‘I didn’t continue with the case because of the money, I continued because I thought it was wrong. In fact, it cost me more than £50.’ Mrs Price, 44, has fiercely contested the fine for the last 12 months, claiming the parking style was advertised by the Smart car manufacturer. The fine has now been overturned on a technicality owing to the parking zone . While contesting the fine, Mrs Price claimed the parking style was a selling point of the Smart car and had been advertised by the manufacturer. Pictured: Smart car promotional material shows the unique parking . The adjudicator ruled that while drivers must park within marked bays in pay-and-display and permit-controlled areas, this was not enforceable in limited waiting spaces on the highway. Mrs Price said she had met her fireman husband Steve, 41, in Stroud town centre minutes before being ticketed, which left her ‘fuming’. As the pair were walking over to a Wilkinson’s store to buy some sweets, they spotted the warden next to their car and the couple went over to speak to him. ‘I tried to reason with him but he was having none of it,’ Mrs Price added. ‘A lot of people were coming out of the shops and taking photos and saying how wrong it was. ‘That is the whole point of a Smart car – to park it like this. It wasn’t blocking the road and there were other cars over the white lines.’ Commenting on the outcome, Jim Daniels, Gloucestershire County Council’s parking manager, said: ‘Parking tickets are assessed on an individual basis and no one case sets a precedent for another. ‘The safety of road users has to be put first so tickets will always be issued, to any vehicle, when it is felt that they aren’t parked legally or safely.’ The second-generation Smart Fortwo, of the kind driven by Mrs Price, was introduced in late 2006 and remains the lightest production car on sale in Europe. The brand name Smart derives from its early history as a cooperative venture between Swatch and Mercedes: Swatch Mercedes ART. Noted for its length of just 8ft 10in, the Smart Fortwo comes in four versions - with diesel, hybrid, or two kinds of petrol engine - each with varying levels of power. The most-basic diesel model has a top speed of just 84mph, taking a leisurely 16.8 seconds to accelerate from 0-60mph. By contrast the 'sports' model, which boasts an engine tweaked by German tuner company Brabus, can tear away from the lights nearly twice as fast, reaching 60mph in just 8.9 seconds and with a top speed of 96mph.","Vanessa Price was issued a £50 fine after parking Smart car at a right-angle .

"A 13-year-old boy has been charged with the murder of a builder after a 'verbal altercation' outside the block of flats in Edmonton where the victim lived. Christopher John Barry, known as Jack, was stabbed on Sunday evening after he was said to be involved in an incident with a group of youths trying to get into a party at another address. He bled to death on the doorstep of his home. Scroll down for video . Bled to death: Jack Barry, 53, was killed in front of his horrified partner Sabrina Finn, 35, on Sunday evening . The attack happened as council worker Miss Finn and Mr Barry returned home, shortly before 8pm on Sunday. Their flat is in a modern block, a stone’s throw from Edmonton Green railway station . The boy has been remanded in custody to appear at Highbury Corner Youth Court tomorrow charged with murder, Scotland Yard said. Four more boys - three aged 14 and one 13 - were also arrested on suspicion of murder. They must return to an east London police station on a date in late January pending further inquiries, Scotland Yard has said. A post-mortem examination yesterday found the cause of Mr Barry's death was a stab wound to the chest. He was with his girlfriend when he is believed to have been involved in an argument with a group of boys as he tried to get through the front door to the flats in The Broadway. Police said he was followed in by two boys and stabbed. Ambulance crews attended but he was pronounced dead at the scene shortly before 8.40pm on Sunday. Forensic officers are at the scene where the man was attacked after reportedly getting into an argument . Mackenzie Muzengi, 61, comforted Jack’s distraught girlfriend, his neighbour Sabrina Finn, 35, as paramedics fought in vain to save the victim’s life. Speaking last night, he said the murder had sent shockwaves through the area and left some residents scared to leave the house. ‘A police officer brought [Miss Finn] to our door and asked if we could look after her because there was a “problem” outside,’ he said. ‘She was very upset and it was very scary, at first we had no idea what was happening. Then the doctor came into the house and said, “I’m sorry, he has died”. Four boys were arrested shortly after the stabbing in Edmonton last night and a fifth boy the next day . Forensics officers at the scene where Mr Barry bled to death on Sunday night . ‘That is when I realised how serious it was. She was in pieces. It was absolutely terrible, they spent 30 minutes trying to save him.’ The attack happened as council worker Miss Finn and her long-term boyfriend returned home, shortly before 8pm on Sunday. Their housing association flat is in a modern block, a stone’s throw from Edmonton Green railway station. Police said the couple were confronted by the youths as they made their way into the building through a secure door, which opens on to the street. Officers suspect the teenagers were trying to get into a party somewhere in the area. The victim - who was with a woman - was followed into the block of flats by two of the males, police said . An officer stands outside Brickland Court. One boy has been charged with murder . Residents have been warned to keep the door closed at all times and not to let strangers inside for their own safety. Mr Muzengi added: ‘Sabrina said they were pressing the buzzer for another flat but no one was answering. ‘She and her boyfriend went through the door and at the same time they tried to push through, and he blocked them. They chased him and stabbed him.’ Mr Muzengi’s wife Petronella, 59, added: ‘There were ambulances flashing and police everywhere ... there is still blood outside.’ Police sealed off the scene after the  stabbing and the man's girlfriend was being looked after by neighbours . As police searched nearby land the man's girlfriend gave a tearful statement to police at the scene in London . The group are believed to have been trying to get into a party when they argued with the victim of the stabbing . Last night it emerged that a 13-year-old boy held a birthday party on Sunday evening in the neighbouring block of flats. His father, who declined to give his name, said he did not know about anyone trying to gatecrash it. He added: ‘We weren’t expecting anyone else and no one was ringing our bell, but we don’t know if some other kids had heard there was a party and were trying to get in. It happens around here. ‘The kids at our place left around 8pm, that’s when we found out what had happened. The police took my son’s friends’ names but they had already arrested some kids.’ Another local resident described Jack as a ‘hero’, adding: ‘Frankly, he did what a lot of people are too scared to do. And this is why.’ Some streets near Edmonton Green are so notorious that they have been dubbed ‘The Swamp’ by local police officers. Street violence is common, and latest figures show knife crime is rising despite huge efforts to clamp down on those carrying weapons. The murder on Sunday was the third in just 16 days. All the killings took place within a mile of each other. Former Catholic school pupil Khiry Ford, 23, was fatally stabbed in the chest by a hooded attacker during a street brawl on November 30. One senior politician responsible for tackling crime in the capital described his death as a ‘catastrophe’. In a separate incident, also on November 30, Maciej Godlewski, 52, from Poland, suffered head injuries during a fight and died four days later in hospital. The latest murder took place just a few hundred yards from the heavily fortified Edmonton Police Station. Gang violence in the area first came to public attention in early 2008, when five youths were murdered in revenge attacks in just three months. And in 2011, 15-year-old Negus McLean was fatally stabbed and beaten with a metal pole by a gang on bikes who tried to steal his brother’s mobile phone. Edmonton Green was also a flashpoint during the London riots in August 2011. On Monday the entrance to the block was cordoned off as forensic teams gathered evidence. Miss Finn was being comforted by her mother Catherine, 57, and half-sister Sarah, 25, at their home in Tottenham yesterday and was too upset to comment. Detective Chief Inspector Neale Baldock said: ‘The victim and this group were not known to each other – what started as a minor verbal altercation has escalated into a shocking act of violence.’ Four of the boys arrested were seized immediately, with a fifth, aged 13, arrested in Enfield Borough at 11.30 on Monday morning before being taken to an East London police station. Detective Chief Inspector Neale Baldock of the Homicide and Major Crime Command, said: 'The victim and this group were not known to each other' and said the row escalated into a 'shocking act of violence' Neighbours said the 52-year-old victim of the stabbing lived with his girlfriend and they were hardworking . Police were searching nearby roads and drains for evidence on Monday morning following the attack .

"Richard Shepherd (pictured) from Doncaster, has been jailed for two years after he admitted stealing thousands from a children's hospice . An accountant who stole more than £13,000 from a hospice for terminally ill children has been jailed for two years. Richard Shepherd, from Doncaster, admitted the 'deplorable' theft after suspicious staff at the South Yorkshire-based Bluebell Wood Children's Hospice installed covert cameras. He was then captured 'red-handed' stealing two large bundles of cash and stashing them down his trousers. All the money pocketed by the 26-year-old financial assistant had been given by the public, including generous donations from children who had handed over their birthday gifts and mourners who donated at funerals. Jailing him, Judge Julian Goose said the terminally ill children at the hospice were 'exceptionally vulnerable' and Shepherd had even met those donating to the charity. 'You personally saw them as they gave you money and you took it from them,' he told him. 'It could have supported children and their families through some of the toughest times they could experience,' he told him. Sheffield Crown Court heard a new chief executive at the hospice became suspicious when she saw him hide something in his pockets and later count cash before work which was not normal procedure. Covert cameras were installed inside the  office and footage showed Shepherd stealing the cash and hiding it down his trousers. He was challenged but initially would only admit to stealing £850. He was sacked and the police were called, said David Wain, prosecuting. He was arrested on July 2, 2013. 'He was caught red-handed in essence,' said Mr Wain who added that the theft had a detrimental effect on Bluebell Wood. Shepherd, who worked for the charity for four years, admitted fraud over a seven-month period between December 1, 2012 and July 1,2013. More than £13,000 of donations were stolen from the South Yorkshire-based Bluebell Wood Children's Hospice (pictured) by Shepherd over a seven month period . The prosecution claimed he stole £20,748 but the defence would only accept a figure of £13,500 and Shepherd was sentenced on the latter figure. The court heard he used a 'sleight of hand' to pocket the charity cash. He kept some cheques back given by well-wishers instead of banking them and recording the amount on the donations account system. When cash was donated he would record the donation but instead of banking it he would submit a cheque for the same amount - leaving him able to deposit the money in his own account. 'This was not an arms-length fraud, he was in contact with the ultimate victims of these offences,' said Mr Wain. The hospice, based in Rotherham, costs more than £3 million a year to run and has to raise over 95 per cent of that funding itself. Shepherd worked alongside another accountant in the finance office and was the junior but often accepted the public donations. Richard Sheldon, defending, said: 'They were offences that were bound to be discovered at some stage, it was only a matter of time. He is totally ashamed of what he has done.' Shepherd had held two jobs in the Doncaster area, working a night shift and delivering fish and chips before he started nights to support his new partner who was pregnant. He has since been thrown out of the matrimonial home and voluntarily sought counselling. Judge Goose said he stole at least £13,500 and other proceeds of crime proceedings would ascertain just how much he gained. Bluebell Wood provided a vital support service for 'desperately ill' children which relied on charitable donations. 'They have to work hard for every penny,' he said. Shepherd's role was to protect the charity's financial interests and his 'high impact' crime had a serious detrimental effect on Bluebell Wood, he added. The judge told him: 'The loss of this money means less care can be provided and what you did may well affect significantly the willingness of people to give to this charity.' Speaking after the sentencing, Clare Rintoul chief executive of Bluebell Wood said: 'We're absolutely sickened that a member of our staff who was in a position of trust has stolen funds from Bluebell Wood. 'Our supporters range from small children giving up their birthday presents to retired grandmothers skydiving for us; all so that we can provide vital support and services to children who won’t live to adulthood and their families.' 'This is a shocking act of calculated betrayal and we hope justice means he will never get the opportunity to do this again.' PC Angela Hardwick who led the investigation said: 'Shepherd's actions are deplorable. To steal money from a charitable organisation especially one that provides essential care and support for terminally ill children and their families is despicable. 'The money he stole allowed Shepherd to fund a lifestyle far above that afforded by his legitimate income.'","Richard Shepherd admitted stealing £13,500 from the children's hospice .

"The Home Office has lost track of 174,000 illegal immigrants and is struggling to find them, a report revealed today. The dossier, which Home Secretary Theresa May has been accused of suppressing, found three-quarters of foreigners refused permission to stay in Britain have vanished. The scandal of huge numbers of ‘over-stayers’ – migrants who remain in the UK even though their visas have expired – was exposed in a scathing study by the independent immigration watchdog. Home Secretary Theresa May arrived for a cabinet meeting at 10 Downing Street in London this morning ahead of a damning report by the chief borders inspector John Vine . John Vine, the Chief Inspector of Borders and Immigration, highlighted the fiasco as the latest in a string of glaring gaps in border controls. Mr Vine, who has clashed with Mrs May over the timing of the release of several reports,  revealed that pre-December 2008, about 232,000 foreigners had applications for visa extensions to allow them to live in the UK rejected. The UK Border Agency – now replaced by the Border Force – should have ensured they left the country, but out of that number, only 58,000 have been tracked down, and either forced to go home or are awaiting deportation. It means 174,000 illegal ‘overstayers’ could not be found. Mr Vine’s report said that 80 per cent of students who are given visas to study here for four years do not leave after that period elapses. Some 85 per cent of sham marriage grooms are students. Officials have also failed to carry out basic checks on more than 200,000 migrants applying for British citizenship every year. John Vine, the Chief Inspector of Borders and Immigration, found the Home Office have lost 174,000 illegal immigrants . The Border Force has only managed to track down 58,000 illegal immigrants who have gone missing . 'Stooge wife': Naima Makda with boyfriend Ibrahim Mahter . BY Andy Dolan . The ringleader of a sham marriage gang used his own girlfriend as a ‘stooge wife’, marrying her to strangers for £8,000. Ibrahim Mahter, 29, organised a string of lucrative fake ceremonies and ‘pressured’ women to take part. His girlfriend, Naima Makda, 28, was one of several bogus brides who would marry foreign nationals for £8,000 a time so that they could stay in the UK. Mahter, along with Abdulgani Makrani, 66, paid the women to marry strangers from Pakistan and India, a court heard. Both men, along with Makda and two other fake brides were jailed on Monday after a judge said they had shown ‘total disrespect for the institution of marriage and UK immigration laws’. Mr Vine’s report – which has sat on Mrs May’s desk for months – heaped fresh humiliation on the beleaguered department. The Home Secretary will also face questions on why she chose to ‘bury’ the document on the day before MPs’ Christmas recess and at the same time as the Al Sweady report into allegations that British soldiers murdered and tortured Iraqi detainees is published. Earlier this year, MPs accused Home Office officials who admitted they had no idea where the missing immigrants and failed asylum seekers were of ‘unacceptable complacency’. Despite being ordered out of the country, many had ‘gone to ground’ and were working in the so-called black economy, illegally claiming benefits and even voting in elections, the Commons’ public accounts committee found. MPs said the shambles had worsened and called for ‘urgent steps’ to sort out the ‘mess’. It is understood there are an additional 3,000 illegal immigrants who need to be removed every week, a figure that does not include foreign offenders or refugees whose request for asylum has been rejected. Last week, a damning report by Mr Vine revealed Home Office staff had given British passports to tens of thousands of illegal immigrants and foreign criminals, including at least one murderer. The relationship between Mr Vine and Mrs May plunged into the deep freeze last year after a critical report on border security was – in an unprecedented move – censored by the Home Secretary. Until this year, the watchdog decided when his reports were published. But after six years and 50 reports, often exposing Government failures, Mrs May seized control of the timing. Mr Vine will leave his post later this month – six months early. Shadow immigration minister David Hanson said: ‘Theresa May has sought to bury reports because they lay bare the total chaos within her own department. They have exposed a murderer granted British citizenship, a growing asylum backlog and 175,000 people here illegally who have disappeared.’ The Home Office said: ‘This Government has ended the system under which the DNA of innocent people was kept indefinitely – but we will never put the public at risk. Police can keep DNA and fingerprints from any EU national who represents a threat to the public.’","Report done by John Vine, Chief Inspector of Borders and Immigration .

"The father of an Australian soldier who was sent hate letters by  Man Haron Monis following the death of his son in Afghanistan, has told media he pitied the man. When Lance Corporal Jason Marks was killed serving with the Special Operations Task Force in Uruzgan Province in 2008,  his father Paul Marks began receiving the abusive letters from Monis. 'I feel sorry for him, he is so twisted, to live with that hate,' Mr Marks told the Herald Sun of the man responsible for Monday's fatal Lindt cafe siege. Scroll down for video . Paul Marks, father of Lance Corporal  Jason Marks who was killed in Afghanistan in 2008, says he pitied Man Haron Monis, who started sending his family abusive hate letters after his son died in action . Lance Corporal Jason Marks,  in Afghanistan 2008, was called a 'killer of innocents' by Monis in letters to his family after his death . Paul Marks and other families of fallen Aussie soldiers, who were similarly targeted by Monis after the deaths of their sons overseas, are joining the call for a review of Australia's bail laws after Monday's siege. Marjorie Worsley, whose son Private Luke Worsley was killed  in a battle with Taliban insurgents in Afghanistan in 2007, said today's tragedy should never have happened. Ms Worsley told reporters how she and her family lived in fear of a man who knew where they lived and who started making abusive, 'ideologically driven' phone calls to their home after the death of their son. She told the Age authorities at the time had assured her and her family that Monis was not a violent person. He was 'more verbal, than action,' they said. Man Haron Monis, 49, who took 17 people hostage in the Lindt cafe in Sydney, was previously convicted for sending abusive letters to families of Australian soldiers who had died overseas. He was sentenced to community service . In 2013, Monis was convicted of sending  menacing letters to the families of seven fallen Australian soldiers. He and wife Amirah Droudis were sentenced to community service over the letters, which relatives at the time said accused the Australian soldiers of killing innocent children. 'Why are they out walking around? There is something wrong with our court system, the police catch them and do their job, but the courts …' Ms Worsley said. 'I think the bail needs to be reviewed.' The family of Private Luke Worsley, an Australian Commando killed in action in 2007, received a 'condolence' letter of abuse from Monis on the day of their son's death. His mother says she feared for her family's safety because Monis man knew where they lived . Both families today expressed their condolences to the families of Katrina Dawson and Tori Johnson, who died after the bloody 16-hour siege early this morning. Mr Marks told the Herald Sun his thoughts and 'empathies' are with the families. It had been a painful day for his own. 'Every time an Australian soldier was killed after Jason it was like a scab coming off an old wound, and this is like that as well,' Mr Marks said. 'We are taking it very quietly today, not leaving the home.' Pallbearers carry the coffin of Private Luke Worsley to a waiting hearse following his funeral in Sydney in 2007.

"Perfect if you're on a short turn-around, a hotel has opened in Japan where you quite literally pay for what you use. The sci-fi '9h nine hours' hotel at Narita Airport, Tokyo, is more like a honeycomb than a honeymoon suite. Rows of sleeping capsules line the building plus locker rooms, showers and a lounge. The bizarre accommodation is just perfect for passengers boarding early morning flights or arriving late by car. The 9h nine hours hotel has been designed to provide adequate facilities for passengers delayed at airport . The rooms are arranged similar to a giant honeycomb, but customers have said they are adequate to sleep in . The washrooms are adjacent to the rooms which frees up more time for sleeping for the guests . The cost is 3,900 yen (around £21) overnight and you leave by 10am. If you just fancy a two-hour nap the cost is 1,500 yen (£8). A shower is a 1,000 yen (£5.50). The rules state that you have one hour to shower and get ready for bed, seven hours to sleep, and a final hour to unwind. You can even pay just for a shower, for £5.50, but just make sure you head to the right section . Guests are given a locker key where they can store their baggage, that corresponds to their room number . There are colour-coded cubicles for women (red) and (black) for men. Each unit is fitted with a Panasonic-built sleeping system that gently lulls you to sleep and wakes you up at a set time by adjusting the light. Report from people who have stayed there are that the capsules are surprisingly comfortable with more space than the average single bed. The hotel opened in July, where before then the airport lacked adequate facilities to rest or stay over should flights be delayed or cancelled. The beds can be slept in for seven hours or two hours depending on how much time the guest has available . The light will alter in the pods which helps the guest know when is the right time to get up . But as the demand for short-stay facilities increases, the 9h nine hours hotel offers competitive rates for varying lengths of stay compared to other accommodation around the airport. On checking in, guests receive a locker key, towel and lounge wear, which are all expected to be returned on leaving the hotel.","The sci-fi '9h nine hours' hotel is open at Narita Airport, Tokyo, Japan .

"Dr Anthony Marsh, chief executive of the troubled East of England Ambulance Service, issued an apology after the incident became known . Paramedics have left bodies unattended at ambulance stations for hours at a time to avoid finishing their shifts late, a disturbing report has revealed. Crews meant to transport bodies to hospital morgues have instead paid undertakers to do the job for them so they can go home. On other occasions they have handed over their vehicles, with a body on board, to workers on the next shift to make sure they could leave on time. The shocking lack of respect shown to the dead emerged in a serious incident review into the case of James Harrison by the East of England ambulance service. Mr Harrison, 32, should have been taken to a hospital morgue in Cambridge after he collapsed and died in the street in September. Instead – in an act branded ‘disgusting’ by patients’ groups – his body was left next to bins at Ely ambulance station in Cambridgeshire by paramedics about to finish their shift. Katherine Murphy, of the Patients’ Association, said: ‘I’m saddened and disgusted at how paramedics feel they can treat somebody just because they’re dead. ‘Whatever happened to public service? How would they like it if it was their own relative?’ The internal report revealed: . Mr Harrison was found a short distance from his home in Cambridgeshire in the early hours of September 24. An emergency call was placed at 5.13am and an ambulance crew arrived at 5.30am. Police also attended but no ‘obvious trauma’ was found so they gave permission for the plumber’s body to be moved. It was placed in a body bag, but instead of being taken to Addenbrooke’s Hospital in Cambridge, it was transported six miles to Ely. The report said: ‘That crew were due to finish at 6am but in an effort to prevent them being too late off shift, the local rapid response vehicle paramedic suggested that they transport the deceased patient to the local ambulance station to remove him from public gaze. The body of James Harrison was left on the floor next to bins for three hours at Ely Ambulance Station after paramedics from East of England Ambulance Service didn't want to work late - the service has apologised . Mr Harrison was found dead near Littleport fire station, where police spent three days investigating his death . ‘The police were asked to arrange for the undertaker to collect the patient from the station and convey him to the hospital mortuary.’ A police officer remained with the body at the ambulance station but when a new sergeant came on shift at 7.45am he informed the ambulance service that the force would not be arranging transport and they would have to take Mr Harrison to Cambridge ‘as soon as possible’. The report said there had not been enough time to investigate the ‘scale’ of the arrangement with the local undertaker or ‘if this is isolated to one undertaker’. Investigations are continuing. A service spokesman admitted the practice may be more widespread, adding: ‘We don’t know how many [times it has happened].’ Investigators also found crews coming to the end of their shift had ‘swapped with an on-coming crew, while en route to the mortuary… on five occasions’. One paramedic has been removed from his role and is working elsewhere under supervision. A decision is yet to be made about what action to take with other members of staff involved. Mr Harrison’s relatives declined to comment yesterday but a friend said: ‘This report has reopened the wounds. It is very upsetting.’ The East of England Ambulance Service has repeatedly been accused of poor performance - which may have contributed to patients' deaths. A report earlier this year found that its response times were unacceptably slow. Mr Harrison's case is the latest embarrassment for East of England Ambulance Service's £232,000-a-year chief executive Dr Anthony Marsh, who in August was revealed to be claiming £18,400 a year on taxi rides as he juggles the post with running the West Midlands service. Dr Marsh made headlines earlier this year when it was revealed he is now earning £232,000 a year  - £90,000 more than the Prime Minister - after landing himself a £50,000 pay rise for taking on EEAS alongside his existing role as chief executive of West Midlands Ambulance Service. In 2011 EEAS was branded the country's worst after being fined £5million for responding to emergencies too slowly - the service was the only one in England which missed targets for reaching accident scenes on time. In April this year the scandal-hit ambulance service was criticised for spending nearly £250,000 on PR staff to defend its reputation. Last year, the trust spent £5,000 a week on five members of staff in its PR department, whose job is to respond to criticism and promote the service's image. In September a 90-year-old woman who shattered her pelvis in a fall was forced to wait six hours for an ambulance to take her to hospital. Barbara Hedley was found by a neighbour at 5.45pm on August 29 and guidelines stipulate an ambulance should have taken her to hospital within 90 minutes. But the widow, who said she feels she was treated like a 'dog', did not arrive at the Norfolk and Norwich Hospital until after midnight. Earlier this year, NHS figures revealed that the trust had been implicated in 155 'serious incidents' since April 2010. Of those, 59 related to the unexpected or avoidable death of a patient - although the trust insisted that it was not responsible for the deaths. The EEAST covers a population of 5.8 million in Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire, Essex, Hertfordshire, Norfolk and Suffolk. Ely Ambulance Station - where Mr Harrison's body was left for three hours as crews didn't want to work late . The report is another blow for East of England service chief executive Anthony Marsh, who has been accused of doing a part-time job because he also runs the West Midlands service. Dr Marsh is paid £232,000 a year, yet under the former ambulanceman, the West Midlands service has been fined £2.6 million for missing targets. And the East of England service reached just 73.6 per cent of ‘Red 1’ calls – the most life-threatening – within eight minutes in the year to March 2014. Health minister Dan Poulter has said: ‘Effectively, Dr Marsh is being paid two salaries at the same time, even though he’s only doing half a job for each ambulance service.’ Dr Marsh declined to comment. Tory MP Priti Patel said: ‘It is unacceptable and disrespectful to treat those who have died in this way. Action should be taken against those responsible.’ Tracy Nicholls, the East of England service’s director of clinical quality, said: ‘We apologise wholeheartedly to the family for the distress this incident has caused – it should never have happened.’","Body of James Harrison found near his home in Littleport, Cambridgeshire .

"Penguins are usual wary creatures but when Joel Oleson visited a beach in Antarctica he made a surprising new furry friend. Oleson, 41 from  California was on a private chartered tour to Antarctica when he  caught on camera the intimate meeting between himself and a baby penguin. The SharePoint expert for Microsoft was speaking at a series of technical conferences in Antarctica and South America when he had his unusual encounter. Joel Oleson, 41 from California was on a private chartered tour to Antarctica when he met a new furry friend . On one day during the tour a guide took him to a large penguin rookery with thousands of penguins along a rocky beach. Oleson says, 'Our guide explained that we should not approach the wildlife, but that if they approached us that was OK. 'He said, the smaller you appear to them, the less intimidating you'll be. So he said it was better to kneel or bend down. I thought if that was the case, then my best case would simply to be to lay down to make myself very small. 'As I lay there, the baby penguins became curious.' Oleson is a SharePoint expert for Microsoft and was speaking at a series of technical conferences in area . The penguin clambers over his neck and appears completely unfazed as his wing rests over his face . In the footage - filmed by Oleson - a baby penguin approaches him and begins to peck at his head and face. The penguin clambers over his neck and appears completely unfazed as his wing rests over his face and he shifts about, gently nuzzling him, before sliding  back onto the rocky beach  to continue pecking at his hat. Oleson says of the experience, 'As they approached me, I was thinking I need to be very still so I don't scare them. They were so cute with the way they walk with their little wings held back as they waddled. Oleson says: 'As they approached me, I was thinking I need to be very still so I don't scare them' While Oleson was surprised how friendly the little bird was it wasn't his first encounter with penguins . 'As one approached my head and started pecking around I wondering how sharp their beak was. At one point a baby penguin was pecking my forehead and face. I was filled with feelings of wonder and awe.' The US technology expert said that the adult penguins kept their distance but the babies were more curious and he didn't notice any hostile or agitated behaviour such as hissing or loud chattering. While Oleson was surprised how friendly the little penguin was it wasn't his first encounter with the flightless breed of bird. 'I'm lucky in that I've spent time with penguins including Jackass penguins near Capetown in South Africa, and on Philip Island with fairy penguins in Australia, so this wasn't my first time spending time with wild penguins.' 'The jackass penguins were very territorial and would nip at you and hiss if you got too close' You can read more about Olseon on his travel blog at travelingepic.com .","Joel Oleson from California was on a private chartered tour to Antarctica .

"The Duke of Cambridge has backed calls for a public inquiry into the case of three men who were mown down and killed by a car during the Birmingham riots of 2011. MailOnline can exclusively reveal it is the first time Prince William has expressed his support for the idea in the case of Haroon Jahan, 20, and brothers Shazad Ali, 30, and Abdul Musavir, 31. The trio were killed in Dudley Road in the Winson Green area of Birmingham in the early hours of August 10, 2011 as they tried to protect businesses from looters. The Duke (left) supports calls for an inquiry into the death of Haroon Jahan (image right, being held by his father Tariq) Prince William meets with Tariq Jahan in Balsall Heath to discuss the lack of justice for the death of his son . Mr Jahan pictured reading messages at the scene where his 20-year-old son Haroon was killed in Winson Green, Birmingham after being hit by a car . Left to right: Haroon Jahan, 20, Shazad Ali, 30, and Abdul Musavir, 31, were run over and killed by a car . During a private meeting with Haroon's father Tariq and senior police officers and community leaders in Balsall Heath, Birmingham, on Friday, the Duke threw his weight behind proposals for an investigation into why there has been no justice for the families of the three men. Eight men were charged with their murder, but were cleared by a jury at Birmingham Crown Court after a senior officer was accused during the case of lying on oath about the late disclosure of an offer to give eye-witnesses immunity from prosecution. A subsequent IPCC report cleared him of any wrongdoing but did criticise another officer for making the offers of immunity, though he has faced no punishment as he has since retired. Abdullah Rehman, who is CEO of the Balsall Heath Forum community group and was at the meeting, said: 'The Prince had asked to meet Tariq for an update on the case. 'It was quite amazing. He showed real sympathy towards him and his situation. 'We feel there had been no accountability (because of) the fact eight men were cleared of this horrific act during the riots. 'We feel the police, the CPS, and the judge were completely incompetent and we as a community are asking for accountability. The Prince listened. 'He then spoke directly to Tariq and said some really reassuring words: never to underestimate himself, keep his chin up and he was 100 per cent backing a public inquiry, which was great news.' Detective Chief Inspector Anthony Tagg was adamant in court during the murder trial that he had disclosed the relevant information regarding the offers of immunity. He and another officer, Detective Inspector Khalid Kiyani, were investigated after the accused walked free. The judge had to tell the jury to disregard much of the evidence and the eight accused were cleared. The Prince at the meeting with police representatives and community leaders, with Mr Jahan to his left . The Duke was praised for 'putting everyone at ease' during the meeting on Friday . The second in line to the throne impressed community leaders with his knowledge of the case . He said he was 'not just words' and was lobbying senior officers for a public inquiry . The IPCC examined the manner of the police probe into the deaths and declared it had been mishandled in a finding unveiled in May this year. During the trial the judge accused DCI Tagg of having lied on oath about the late disclosure of an offer to give eyewitnesses immunity from prosecution. The IPCC report said Mr Tagg had no case to answer for misconduct. But it ruled DI Kiyani had acted recklessly in offering immunity to witnesses at a public meeting and would have faced misconduct charges had he not retired in 2012. The new West Midlands Police and Crime Commissioner David Jamieson and his deputy Yvonne Mosquito were also at the discussion on Friday . After the meeting with the Duke, Mr Rehman told BBC West Midlands radio interviewer Arshia Riaz: 'It was quite overwhelming really, the way he talked to Tariq, the way he spoke to all of us and the sympathy that he showed towards this whole injustice was really heartwarming.' Mr Rehman said the Duke insisted he was 'not just words' but he was talking with senior police officers and the Governor General to get a public inquiry. He said the Prince wanted it 'to happen as soon as possible because there is an amount of trust that has been lost.' He added: 'In my job it is a big disadvantage if people in the community do not trust the police and the justice system. 'The meeting was really heart-warming and has given us a lot of confidence that there will be a public inquiry now. 'With the fact that the crime commissioner and the deputy crime commissioner were there as well, we hope something will come from this.

'I think there will be more support now the Prince has given his approval and this will get the ball rolling.' Mr Rehman paid tribute to William's knowledge of the case and the way he made everyone feel at ease. 'I didn't know what to expect, but the Prince was really down to earth', he said. 'I do think it is down to his wonderful mother and the way she brought him up. 'How he welcomed us, spoke to us and how he really put us at ease when we were talking to him and the compassion he showed Tariq was really heart-warming.' The atmosphere on the streets of Birmingham was extremely tense after the deaths of the three young men in 2011, with some groups calling for revenge. Mr Jahan was credited with restoring calm after urging local youths to put their faith in the justice system. But his own faith in that system has since been sorely tested after he was denied justice for the death of his son. Mr Jahan wrote on Facebook that his bid for a public inquiry had also been backed by the family of the two brothers who died alongside Haroon.

Prayers are held at Summerfield Park before the funeral for three men killed while guarding against looters in Winson Green area of Birmingham on August 18, 2011 . He posted pictures of his meeting with the Prince on the site and wrote: 'The Prince has given his full support and backing in calling for a public inquiry into the case of the three murdered boys. 'Three years on we still need answers and ultimately justice.' A spokesman for Clarence House declined to comment on the meeting, but did say the Duke has met privately with Mr Jahan on each of his last three visits to Birmingham. This includes last week's trip, with the other two taking place in 2011 and 2013. A statement from West Midlands Police said: 'A comprehensive and high profile investigation was carried out in relation to the deaths of Haroon Jahan, Shazad Ali, and Abdul Musavir. 'Extensive evidence was presented to the Crown Prosecution Service, who authorised the charge of eight men with murder. 'Following a lengthy crown court hearing they were found not guilty of murder by a jury on July 19, 2012. 'If substantial new information or evidence were to become available, it would examined by West Midlands Police, and if appropriate we would take it to the Crown Prosecution Service for their consideration. 'However it is difficult to see where that evidence could come from. What happened that night and who was involved was not really in dispute. 'The jury, having heard all the evidence and having seen all the CCTV, decided that the defendants were innocent. 'The judge therefore remarked that what happened must have been a terrible accident.'","Prince William meets Haroon Jahan's father Tariq in Birmingham .

"It’s every beer drinker’s worst nightmare: You set your bottle down on a table and open it, only for the drink to foam up and come shooting out, drenching the table and most likely you as well. But that nightmare might soon become a thing of the past thanks to an unlikely source: magnets. Researchers have found that applying a magnetic field to an antifoaming agent, they can reduce the foaming effect to a huge degree - and it could bring the cost of beer down in future. Belgian researchers have used magnets to make beer less foamy. Applying a magnetic field made antifoaming agents more effective. The field is applied when hops extract is added to beer's malt base. This prevents it from attracting too much CO2 - which causes foam . The research, led by Zahra Shokribousjein from the Centre for Food and Microbial Biology in Belgium, studied the effect of a bottle of beer overfoaming. Known as gushing, it occurs when fungi infect the beer’s malt base, latching on with surface proteins called hydrophobins, according to Science Magazine. If you’ve ever been a student at university, you’ve likely experienced the effects of hitting the bottom of one beer bottle against the neck of another. Doing so will cause the struck beer to foam up uncontrollably - but what’s the science behind this process? Earlier this year a study carried out by the Institute Jean le Rond D'Alembert and the Université Pierre et Marie Curie, in France, found that it occurs in three phases. First, expansion and compression waves appear. These advance inside the liquid and cause the gas cavities (bubbles) to burst at the bottom of the bottle. Afterwards, small balls of foam are formed because the bubbles break into even smaller ones. Finally, given that they weigh less than the liquid surrounding them, these bubbles move to the surface so rapidly that the final result is similar to an explosion . When the beer is being brewed, these hydrophobins attract carbon dioxide molecules, which make the beer bubbly. To counteract the effects, brewers use hops extract, which is an antifoaming agent that binds to the proteins and prevents them attracting CO2. However, the process is not wholly effective, and beer can still become overly bubbly or foamy in some instances. The latest study though found that when a magnetic field was applied to malt, the hops extract was broken into smaller particles. To apply the field, the researchers passed the liquid through a tube with a magnet wrapped around it. They found that this increased the effectiveness of the antifoaming agent, prevent CO2 from binding with the hydrophobins. In fact, the method was so effective that much lower amounts of hops extract were needed, reducing the cost of brewing the beer in the first place. And the process, which takes only a minute, also made the beer taste less bitter. The method was so effective that much lower amounts of hops extract (stock image of hops pictured) were needed, reducing the cost of brewing the beer in the first place. The method takes just one minute and could make beer cheaper - as less hops extract is needed to prevent the formation of foam . ‘The results indicate that when a magnetic field exerted on hop extract, this compound is dispersed more and smaller particles are formed,’ the researchers write in their paper. ‘Therefore, the specific surface areas of the particles are increased and interact with larger numbers of hydrophobins.’ The research, to be published in the January edition of the Journal of Food Engineering, took place at the Belgian Orval Bewerey. And the next step will be to try and increase the scale of the method, to increase it to industrial-level production.","Belgian researchers have used magnets to make beer less foamy .

"Animal advocates are fighting save the life of a German shepherd after his owner demanded in her will that he be euthanized and buried with her after her death last month. Connie Lay, of Aurora, Indiana, decreed before her death that her beloved dog Bela should be put down, cremated and his ashes mixed with hers. Her attorney says that Bela is Lay's property and that she is free to do with him what she wishes. Volunteers at the PAWS Humane Center, which is boarding Bela until his fate is sealed, say that he is a sweet, healthy dog who should be adopted out to a new home. Cruel fate: Bela is due to be euthanized after his owner stipulated that he should be with her for eternity after her death last month . Numerous families have come forward and asked to adopt him - but Ms Lay's lawyer says that the dog is her property and she gets to decide what happens to him. 'The dog was owned by my client and now it’s part of her estate,' Doug Denmure told WCPO-TV. 'And those are her wishes, as far as the future of the dog is concerned. Outsiders don’t have the grounds to rewrite the provisions of my client’s will and impose what they want.' Under Indiana law, pets and other animals are considered property. Owners must treat them humanely, but otherwise get allowed to decide whether they live or die. Lay died on November 25 - but before her death she made arrangements with her lawyer and a close friend to 'dispose' of all her property  - including Bela. Mr Denmure told WCPO that the dog is aggressive and that Ms Lay kept a record of his aggressive behavior before she died. Bela is currently being boarded at the PAWS Humane Center while he awaits his fate. Several families have offered to adopt him . When she passed away at her home, Bela fiercely guarded her body and would not let anyone enter the house. However, volunteers who have worked with Bela since he was taken to the shelter say that he hasn't shown signs of being overly aggressive, according to WXIX-TV. There is one other provision that Ms Lay made in her will for Bela. He could be sent to a no-kill animal refuge in southern Utah. However, Mr Denmure says she didn't leave behind enough money to send Bela to the shelter, called Best Friends Animal Society. Mr Denmure said he's currently accepting donations from anyone who wants to contribute to a fund to transport the pooch to Utah. It is unknown much long Bela has before he will be euthanized.","Connie Lay died on November 25 and stipulated in her will that her dog Bela be euthanized, cremated and his remains mixed with hers .

"A Pennsylvania police chief’s daughter and two men involved in a brutal attack on a gay couple which captured national attention will stand trial, a judge ruled Tuesday. Kathryn Knott, the 24-year-old daughter of Chalfont Police Chief Karl Knott, Philip Williams, 24, and Kevin Harrigan, 26, face felony assault and conspiracy charges with a maximum penalty of 30 years in jail. The trio were involved in a late-night brawl on September 11 in the streets of Philadelphia which left Zachary Hesse, 28, 'terrified' and his boyfriend, Andy Haught, with a broken jaw and cheekbones. Scroll down for video . Trial date set: Philip Williams, left, Kathryn Knott and Kevin Harrigan face felony assault and conspiracy charges with a maximum penalty of 30 years in jail following a street brawl with a gay couple . According to testimony by Hesse, 28,  the confrontation began around 10:45pm. He and his partner had left a frozen-yogurt shop and were walking to get pizza in the city's Gayborhood when they came across eight to ten young adults out on the town. One of the revelers allegedly asked if they were gay, using profanity and slurs in the process. Hesse confirmed that they were - echoing the same crude language - and they soon found themselves surrounded. Hesse said he was pushed back and promptly punched in the face. 'After that, it just kind of got messy . . . [I felt] terrified,' he recalled. He identified Harrigan as the man who  hit him in the head while Knott 'smacked or hit' him in the head and called him a 'f***ing fa**ot.' In a matter of minutes, Hesse's boyfriend was lying in a pool of blood with a broken jaw and broken cheekbones. A nearby resident called 911, and the alleged attackers took off. Night out: The group were caught on surveillance footage the night they allegedly beat up Zachary Hesse, 28, and his boyfriend, Andy Haught . Hurt: One of the victims shared this photo of his injuries. One of the men needed his jaw wired shut . Security video posted online by police helped identify the group, many of them friends from their days at a suburban Catholic high school. The incident in downtown Philadelphia's tony Rittenhouse neighborhood swirled on news and social media sites in September. It has alternately been described as a routine street fight or a homophobic attack in a state that doesn't include sexual orientation in its hate crime law. Less than a month after the incident, ABC News reported that Knott was fired from her job as an emergency room technician due to her questionable social media behavior. Her Twitter account featured homophobic and racist remarks along with brags about frequent drunkenness. Boasts suggesting special treatment from her father also came to light. Commenting on Tuesday's ruling, Assistant District Attorney Mike Barry said: 'I think this court knows, it's going to be an interesting trial.' He asked Common Pleas Judge Charles Hayden to leave the answer to a jury. The judge agreed and ordered the defendants to return to court in January to enter pleas. Defense lawyers vow to mount a vigorous defense for their clients. In court Tuesday, they compared the case to a street brawl, arguing that both parties took part. 'We don't have a conspiracy, a wolf pack, a group of young people seeking to beat people up on the streets of Philadelphia,' defense lawyer Fortunato Perri Jr. argued. Prosecutors took a darker view and called the initial query about the men's sexuality 'fighting words.' Electronic footprint: Less than a month after the incident Knott - daughter of Chalfont Police Chief Karl Knott - was fired from her job as an emergency room technician due to her questionable social media behavior - her Twitter account included homophobic remarks . 'They got attacked just for being who they were,' Barry said. He said defendant Harrigan ignited the fight when he hurled a slur at Hesse and threw the first punch. Witness Geoff Nagle, who was looking out a third-floor window, said he saw a woman pointing a finger at one of the victims and then heard three to four punches land. He took a cellphone photo and called 911. Prosecutors said they believe co-defendant Williams moved through the crowd to 'sucker-punch' Haught. However, the defense said he went to Knott's aid after Haught struck her. 'Phil Williams is not initially an aggressor here,' Perri argued. 'He gets involved after a female is punched. ... That is actually justified, under the circumstances.' The three defendants, who are free on bail, are scheduled to appear in court January 6 for their arraignments. They are the only members of the larger party to be charged.","Kathryn Knott, the 24-year-old daughter of Chalfont Police Chief Karl Knott, Philip William, 24, and Kevin Harrigan, 26, face felony assault and conspiracy charges with a maximum penalty of 30 years in jail .

"A television reporter has revealed the moment he was contacted by hostages from inside the Lindt Cafe in Sydney's Martin Place on Monday, six hours after the siege began. Mark Burrows from Nine News received phone calls from Marcia Mikhael and Julie Taylor with their hostage taker shiek just metres away, listening to their every word. He also spoke to one other hostage who was not named in the report. During their conversations the women were forced to repeat Man Haron Monis's demands, but perhaps the most chilling details came from Ms Mikhael, a Westpac executive trapped inside the building with three of her colleagues. Scroll down for video . Marcia Mikhael contacted Nine News reporter Mark Burrows six hours into the siege at Sydney's Martin Place . After greeting Burrows, the 42-year-old assured him that all the hostages were safe and well thanks to 'The Brother', which is how they were referring to their captor, a self-style shiek. 'However there was a very close missed call by people escaping and we almost got shot in here however we're all well,' Ms Mikhael revealed. Speaking incredibly calmly for someone trapped in such a horrific situation, the only time she wavered was when speaking about Prime Minister Tony Abbott. Lawyer Julie Taylor also placed a phone call from inside the cafe, revealing calmly she was pregnant but unwell and frightened . Mark Burrows spoke to hostages from the Nine newsroom on Monday afternoon . 'He (Man Haron Monis) would also like to speak to the prime minister, we understand that the prime minister is a very busy man however I think that the lives of quite a few people here are more important than whatever he's doing right now whether he's playing golf, or walking with his dog. 'I don't know what the hell he's doing but it cannot be more important than picking up the phone and making one phone call, that is not hard,' the woman said with emotion in her voice. Reports of a number of the hostages falling ill had circulated during the day and Burrows asked after their health. 'We have one pregnant lady that's not doing very well and the other one is being very brave but she's also not doing very well,' Ms Mikhael said. 'We don't want to die. There's a lot of people in here and we've got families. We want to go home and we want to go home safe.' Ms Mikael was one of the hostages pictured being carried out of the cafe, looking distressed and with blood on her legs when the siege ended. Another hostage to make contact with Nine News was Sydney barrister Julie Taylor, who was saved from the gunman by friend Katrina Dawson. Ms Dawson, a mother-of-three tragically died while being transported to hospital. 'There are a few sick people inside and also two pregnant people. I'm pregnant and there's one other lady who's pregnant. 'He (Monis) says that he's made an offer, um, to trade one flag of Islamic State for a life,' Ms Taylor told Burrows. Ms Mikael was one of the hostages  carried out of the cafe with blood on her legs when the siege ended . The hostage also revealed hesitantly that although she and others were 'not exactly' being threatened by their captor, she was not feeling well and everyone was extremely frightened. Ms Taylor also told Burrows that Monis did have a gun, and when prompted concluded it was a rifle of some description. The barrister is currently recovering in hospital, along with three other women who suffered gunshot wounds. She was one of three women to appear in videos released by Monis where hostages to a camera relaying the demands of their captor. Barrister Katrina Dawson, 38, and Lindt cafe manager Tori Johnson, 34, both died as a result of the siege which shut down Sydney's CBD for more than 24 hours.","Nine News reporter Mark Burrows received calls from three hostages .

"It has been a longstanding mystery for scientists - how water arrived on Earth. Now, researchers say they may have an answer - it was here all along. A new theory claims that giant underwater 'oceans' of water is stored in porous rock. Researchers at Ohio State University believe the same amount of water that currently fills the Pacific Ocean could be buried deep inside the planet right now - and that underground 'oceans' or rock were created at the same time the earth was. Central to the study is the idea that rocks that appear dry to the human eye can actually contain water—in the form of hydrogen atoms trapped inside natural voids and crystal defects. Oxygen is plentiful in minerals, so when a mineral contains some hydrogen, certain chemical reactions can free the hydrogen to bond with the oxygen and make water. Stray atoms of hydrogen could make up only a tiny fraction of mantle rock, the researchers explained. Given that the mantle is more than 80 percent of the planet's total volume, however, those stray atoms add up to a lot of potential water. Researchers at Ohio State University believe the same amount of water that currently fills the Pacific Ocean could be buried deep inside the planet right now. The new study is helping to answer a longstanding question that has recently moved to the forefront of earth science: Did our planet make its own water through geologic processes, or did water come to us via icy comets from the far reaches of the solar system? The answer is likely 'both,' according to the team, who are to present their work at the American Geophysical Union (AGU) meeting in San Francisco tomorrow. They found a previously unknown geochemical pathway by which the Earth can sequester water in its interior for billions of years and still release small amounts to the surface via plate tectonics, feeding our oceans from within. 'When we look into the origins of water on Earth, what we're really asking is, why are we so different than all the other planets?' Wendy Panero, associate professor of earth sciences at Ohio State said. 'In this solar system, Earth is unique because we have liquid water on the surface. 'We're also the only planet with active plate tectonics. 'Maybe this water in the mantle is key to plate tectonics, and that's part of what makes Earth habitable.' Central to the study is the idea that rocks that appear dry to the human eye can actually contain water—in the form of hydrogen atoms trapped inside natural voids and crystal defects. Oxygen is plentiful in minerals, so when a mineral contains some hydrogen, certain chemical reactions can free the hydrogen to bond with the oxygen and make water. Stray atoms of hydrogen could make up only a tiny fraction of mantle rock, the researchers explained. Given that the mantle is more than 80 percent of the planet's total volume, however, those stray atoms add up to a lot of potential water. This plate tectonics diagramshows how mantle circulation delivers new rock to the crust via mid-ocean ridges. New research suggests that mantle circulation also delivers water to the oceans. In a lab at Ohio State, the researchers compress different minerals that are common to the mantle and subject them to high pressures and temperatures using a diamond anvil cell—a device that squeezes a tiny sample of material between two diamonds and heats it with a laser—to simulate conditions in the deep Earth. They examine how the minerals' crystal structures change as they are compressed, and use that information to gauge the minerals' relative capacities for storing hydrogen. Then, they extend their experimental results using computer calculations to uncover the geochemical processes that would enable these minerals to rise through the mantle to the surface—a necessary condition for water to escape into the oceans. Where it is: Researchers say the minerals called ringwoodite and wadsleyite can store water like a sponge, and reveals the Earth's transition zone could be a vast reservoir of water . In a paper now submitted to a peer-reviewed academic journal, they reported their recent tests of the mineral bridgmanite, a high-pressure form of olivine. While bridgmanite is the most abundant mineral in the lower mantle, they found that it contains too little hydrogen to play an important role in Earth's water supply. Another research group recently found that ringwoodite, another form of olivine, does contain enough hydrogen to make it a good candidate for deep-earth water storage. So Panero and Pigott focused their study on the depth where ringwoodite is found—a place 325-500 miles below the surface that researchers call the 'transition zone'—as the most likely region that can hold a planet's worth of water. Graham Pearson holds the first terrestrial sample of ringwoodite ever found - which led to the discovery . From there, the same convection of mantle rock that produces plate tectonics could carry the water to the surface. For the research presented at AGU, Panero and Pigott performed new computer calculations of the geochemistry in the lowest portion of the mantle, some 500 miles deep and more. There, another mineral, garnet, emerged as a likely water-carrier—a go-between that could deliver some of the water from ringwoodite down into the otherwise dry lower mantle. If this scenario is accurate, the Earth may today hold half as much water in its depths as is currently flowing in oceans on the surface, Panero said—an amount that would approximately equal the volume of the Pacific Ocean. This water is continuously cycled through the transition zone as a result of plate tectonics. 'If all of the Earth's water is on the surface, that gives us one interpretation of the water cycle, where we can think of water cycling from oceans into the atmosphere and into the groundwater over millions of years,' she said. Schematic partial cross section of the Earth showing the location of ringwoodite, which make up approximately 60% by volume of this part of the transition zone. The diamond containing the water-bearing ringwoodite inclusion found by originated from approximately 500 km beneath the Earth's surface, where a large mass of water may accumulate by the subduction and recycling of oceanic lithosphere, into the transition zone. 'But if mantle circulation is also part of the water cycle, the total cycle time for our planet's water has to be billions of years.' Earlier this year Canadian researchers say analysis of a rare mineral points to the huge store of water deep in Earth's mantle, 400-600 kilometres (250-375 miles) beneath our feet. It echoes the hundred and fifty year old novel, 'Journey to the Centre of the Earth', in which French science-fiction forerunner Jules Verne pictured a vast sea that lay deep under our planet's surface. The new theory, backed up by seismic data suggest that water is stored in the transition zone of Earth's mantle. It is thought to host minerals called ringwoodite and wadsleyite that can store water like a sponge. If water does exists in huge volumes beneath Earth's crust, it is bound to have a big impact on the mechanics of volcanoes and the movement of tectonic plates. The evidence comes from a water-loving mineral called ringwoodite that came from the so-called transition zone sandwiched between the upper and lower layers of Earth's mantle, they said in the journal Nature. Analysis shows that 1.5% of the rock comprises molecules of water. The find backs once-contested theories that the transition zone, or at least significant parts of it, is water-rich, the investigators said. 'This sample really provides extremely strong confirmation that there are local wet spots deep in the Earth in this area,' said Graham Pearson of Canada's University of Alberta, who led the research. 'That particular zone in the Earth, the transition zone, might have as much water as all the world's oceans put together.' The $20 diamond that led to the discovery: Diamond sample JUc29, from Juina, Brazil, containing the hydrous ringwoodite inclusion. The rough diamond has been naturally sculptured to its unusual shape by corrosive mantle fluids during transport to the surface. Hans Keppler, a geologist at the University of Bayreuth in Germany, cautioned against extrapolating the size of the subterranean water find from a single sample of ringwoodite. And he also said the water was likely to be locked up in specific rocks, in a molecular form called hydroxyl. 'In some ways it is an ocean in Earth's interior, as visualised by Jules Verne... although not in the form of liquid water,' Keppler said in a commentary also published by Nature. The implications of the discovery are profound, Pearson suggested. If water exists in huge volumes beneath Earth's crust, it is bound to have a big impact on the mechanics of volcanoes and the movement of tectonic plates. 'One of the reasons the Earth is such a dynamic planet is the presence of some water in its interior. Water changes everything about the way a planet works,' said Pearson.","Oceans believed to be 400-600 kilometres (250-375 miles) beneath our feet .

"Bill Cosby victim Beverly Johnson found herself in the middle of the war between Rosie O'Donnell and Whoopi Goldberg when she asked Whoopi if she would do a one-on-one interview on The View rather than be questioned by the other co-hosts. Apparently there was no such thing as a holiday cease-fire behind the scenes at the faltering daytime talk show after Rosie learned that Johnson would only appear on the show if Whoopi alone conducted the interview. The ex-supermodel had reached out to Whoopi privately to share her experience with Cosby after seeing the Oscar winner express endless support for the troubled TV icon on The View. Scroll down for video . Tug if war: Former supermodel Beverly Johnson had insisted that she would come on The View only if she could have a one-on-one interview with Whoopi Golderg and not Rosie O'Donnell, Rosie Perez or Nicolle Wallace. Eventually Rosie got her way and Johnson sat sown with all the co-hosts . Rosie Perez had a major melt down recently after a hostile, gum-chewing Rosie O treated her with disdain during an on-air segment discussing the rape allegations against Bill Cosby. Perez had argued that Cosby has been pilloried by social media and that there is no way to prove that the allegations are true . Goldberg knew in advance that Johnson was going to break her silence. 'Whoopi is so conflicted on the matter because knows both Bill and Beverly. Though she wants to continue to give Bill the benefit of the doubt, she also knows that Beverly would not lie about something like this if it wasn't true,' a source close to the show tells Mail Online. Goldberg asked Johnson to come on The View to discuss her story with their audience. The supermodel said she would, but only if she could sit down one-on-one with Goldberg, who passed her desires along to the show's producers. Johnson says that she went to Bill Cosby's Manhattan townhouse for an audition and believes that he had drugged her cappuccino . 'Producers were willing to do whatever Beverly wanted to get her on the show and agreed to cut out Rosie as well as other co-hosts Rosie Perez and Nicolle Wallace. 'That infuriated Rosie,' the source explained. O'Donnell hit the roof hearing that Johnson would appear on The View only in a sit down with Whoopi. She felt the move was a 'slap in the face,' as she has been very vocal in her support for the victims and belief that Cosby is a rapist. Her passion for the Cosby story has also created tension with fellow co-host Rosie Perez, as previously reported by Mail Online. Perez had a major melt down after a hostile, gum-chewing Rosie O treated her with disdain during an on-air segment discussing the rape allegations against Bill Cosby. Perez had argued that Cosby has been pilloried by social media and that there is no way to prove that the allegations are true. Perez attempted to defend her opinion to O'Donnell but O'Donnell wasn't having it. O'Donnell told producers she 'would not stand for that,' and escalated her complaint to ABC News, that now oversees The View. She went to the network level and complained about the decision. After pleading her case, ABC News actually agreed with her and told producers to go back to Beverly and tell her she had to talk to all of the co-hosts,' the source detailed. The rift between the two hosts of The View is so bad,  Rosie was the only personality from the show that Whoopi did not invite to her annual holiday party . 'Goldberg felt that O'Donnell had filed the complaint just to undermine her, especially since she has done solo interviews and segments with her friend Marilu Henner and various child stars she wanted on the show. On The View Monday, Johnson told her story about her visit to Cosby's Manhattan brownstone where she was convinced he drugged her and then threw her into a cab when she she screamed MF realizing what he had done. While Rosie  seemed sympathetic, Whoopi could not seem to wrap her head around what Johnson was saying. ""I do not think [that Bill Cosby raped me], no,"" replied Johnson when Goldberg asked if she had been sexually assaulted by Cosby. ""You're not sure?"" Goldberg asked, appearing somewhat skeptical of what actually happened.The rift between the two hosts of The View is so bad, O'Donnell was the only personality from the show that Goldberg did not invite to her annual holiday party at her home outside the city last Starday. Perez and Nicolle Wallace attended.","Former supermodel Beverly Johnson confided to Whoopi that she was a Bill Cosby victim even before the Vanity Fair article appeared .
She told Whoopi she would come on The View, but only if Whoopi did the interview ALONE .
Whoopi has been a staunch supporter of Cosby, unlike Rosie who appears disgusted by the rape accusations .

"They are no strangers to the official portrait or, indeed, the wax figurine, but now Spain's King Felipe and Queen Letizia have been immortalised in another substance entirely - chocolate. The life-size statues of the Spanish royals are the work of Córdoba bakery, Galleros Artesanos, and join a group that also includes Pope Francis and former Spanish king, Juan-Carlos. Making the enormous sculptures required a truly king-sized amount of chocolate - 340kg for Felipe and 320kg for Letizia. The chocolate statues of (l-r) Queen Letizia, King Felipe, former queen Sofia and former king Juan Carlos on display at the patisserie Galleros Artesanos in Rute, Andalucia, Spain . Juan-Carlos proved the heaviest hitter in chocolate terms, with a hefty 450kg of the sweet stuff needed for his likeness. Pope Francis, whose sculpture is, unlike the others, made from white chocolate, required an impressive 350kg. Lightest is former queen Sofia, whose statue needed just 280kg of chocolate to complete. Sadly for those who fancy finding King Felipe in their stockings, the sculptures are one-offs and will be polished off by the children of Galleros Artesanos' owner come Christmas Day. The sculptures, some of which were first unveiled during Christmas 2013, aren't the first time the Spanish royals have found themselves on the end of an unusual artistic tribute. In October, the Wax Museum in Madrid revealed their latest likenesses of the Spanish royal family - but with rather less success than the Galleros Artesanos. A roya treat: King Felipe, left, and former king of Spain Juan Carlos have both been immortalised in chocolate . In tasty company: The life-size statues of the Spanish royals join a group that also includes Pope Francis and former Spanish king, Juan-Carlos . Tradition: A few years ago the patisserie owners decided to celebrate Christmas time by creating life size copies of prominent personalities made of chocolate with two patisserie chefs working for three months on each sculpture . Lowlights included a bizarre frozen-faced take on Letizia and a creepy version of the usually adorable Infanta Leonor. Odd-looking waxworks aren't only a problem for the Spanish royal family, however, with the British royals also immortalised in a series of terrible statues. Prince Harry, who now boasts an updated and considerably more lifelike waxwork at Madame Tussaud's in London, was, until recently, another victim of a royal waxwork disaster. Not only did the sculpture have hair that was noticeably lighter than the real Harry's copper hue, the figure also looked considerably more like Barbie's boyfriend Ken than the prince. Other horrible royal sculptures include the terrifying take on the Duchess of Cornwall that once graced Madame Tussaud's and an unusual rendering of the Prince of Wales that looked more like a Spitting Image puppet than the royal himself. The non-chocolate versions: King Felipe VI and Queen Letizia pictured receiving Academia de las Artes y Las Ciencias Cinematograficas members at the Zarzuela Palace on December 15, 2014 in Madrid . Family: Along with Felipe and co, the museum has made waxworks of King Juan-Carlos and Queen Silvia . Frightening: The Spanish royals aren't the only ones to be afflicted by bad waxworks as this one proves . Back to normal: The real Camilla is much prettier (and far less frightening) than her wax doppelganger . Is it Prince Harry? Or Ken! A terrible take on Charles (left) and a Prince Harry that looks more like a Ken doll . Much better: The real royals are both better looking and a little more rugged than the waxworks . One royal who has had no such problems with waxwork tributes is the Queen, whose Madame Tussaud's sculpture is updated regularly to ensure it looks as close to the real thing as possible. The current version was made to coincide with the Diamond Jubilee in 2012 and wears a stunning silver lace dress embroidered with 53,000 Swarovski crystals. Another set of royals to boast accurate waxworks are the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, whose likenesses first entered the waxwork museum shortly after their wedding in 2011. Although the Duchess' smile does look slightly fixed, her long chestnut locks are spot on as is the dress - a copy of the blue Issa number worn to announce her engagement to Prince William. Like Prince Harry, the royal couple got a makeover this year, with Kate now sporting a pretty teal dress and a regal swept-back hairdo. Big improvement: A new Prince Harry sculpture that looks far more like the real thing was recently unveiled . No problem: The Queen's waxwork is regularly updated and wears a dress that boasts 53,000 crystals . New look: The latest statues of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge were unveiled in July .","Felipe and Letizia of Spain have been immortalised in chocolate .

"A town has been left overflowing with rubbish bags after binmen have refused to pick them up - because the sacks are the wrong colour. Mountains of household waste is lining streets in Weymouth, Dorset, after residents were given blue bin bags as part of a new waste collection scheme rolled out in the town. But some claim they did not receive the new blue sacks, and have continued to use the standard black ones - only for them to be left by the side of the road by binmen under strict orders not to take away the 'unauthorised bags'. Piles of rubbish bags have been mounting up in streets around the town for the past two weeks, to the anger of residents. Mountains of household waste is lining streets in Weymouth, Dorset, after binmen have refused to pick them up - because the sacks are the wrong colour . Rubbish has been left on the streets in Weymouth for as long as two weeks because it is in 'unauthorised' regular black bin bags instead of the authorised blue sacks . The council-run Dorset Waste Partnership said it is 'applying its policy' to limit residents to one household rubbish bag a week in the hope they will recycle more. They said they sent leaflets to every household before the new system was put in place, and have been delivering blue sacks to properties that didn't get them. Residents have branded the decision to leave the black bin bags 'childish' and have called on the council to sort out the problem before Christmas. Town centre resident Andy Price said: 'There are families with young children down here and I think it is disgusting that they are leaving the rubbish on the roads. It's a health risk. 'It is going to encourage rodents, and seagulls have already been ripping the bags open.' John Gough, owner of popular Weymouth pub the Cutter Hotel, said: 'I know they are saying they have informed everyone about the blue bags and I am sure they have - but if they didn't give you the bags, what can you do? I have told them I do not have the blue bags.' The council-run Dorset Waste Partnership said it is 'applying its policy' to limit residents to one household rubbish bag a week in the hope they will recycle more . Local councillor Francis Drake said: 'It's tit for tat. The DWP should pick up all the rubbish rather than leaving it - then send someone round to educate residents. 'This needs to be sorted out otherwise this town is going to have a big health problem.' Residents voiced their concerns on social media. Arlbergbahn said: 'Oh this is getting pathetic. Just how idiotically stubborn are these pompous bureaucrats? 'We are now applying the policy', 'we are sending education teams', like they're politicians. Don't be so pathetically childish and stubborn.' Gerbilface said: 'Lazy bin men are the problem, just pick the black bags up for now God's sake! Then post a handful of blue bags through every door or leave them at the Cutter pub for locals to pick them up if they can'tbe bothered to post them. Is it really that hard to sort this issue out?' CharlesCharlieCharleyson said: 'DWP: Do the job you are paid to do and pick up the rubbish! I don't give a damn what colour the bags are you children.' Residents have branded the decision to leave the black bin bags 'childish' and have called on the council to sort out the problem before Christmas . Steve Burdis, director of the Dorset Waste Partnership, said: 'We sent leaflets to every household about the new service in April and May to give them time to contact us. We also held roadshows and provided information through the local media and online. 'Properties unable to use wheelie bins receive an annual supply of authorised blue sacks for rubbish. Our policy states that we will not collect rubbish left outside a bin in unauthorised sacks. 'During the first two months we collected extra sacks while the service was bedding in but we are now applying the policy. 'We have been delivering outstanding blue sacks to properties that have contacted us. Our education team is working alongside collection crews, going door-to-door advising residents.' Communities Secretary Eric Pickles declared two years ago that having bins emptied once a week was a ‘fundamental right’ – but cutbacks to the service have accelerated under his watch, with 60 councils introducing a fortnightly waste collection since May 2010. Once-a-week household rubbish collections came into law in 1875 to stamp out cholera and other plagues which claimed huge numbers of lives. They were maintained until after Labour’s 1997 election victory.","Mountains of household waste is lining streets in Weymouth, Dorset .

"A Samurai sword-fighting RAF Officer and cancer survivor has been crowned Britain's Manliest Man. Flight Lieutenant Alun 'Peps' Pepper, 43, fought off more than 1,000 fellow testosterone-filled applicants to win the nationwide competition. A true thrillseeker, Alun's favourite hobbies include skydiving, Thai boxing and he attends Japanese Samurai sword classes - all on top of his job as a Fast Jet Weapons System officer for the RAF. Alun Pepper, pictured at the top of Mount Kilimanjaro, has been crowed Britain's Manliest Man . The Samurai sword-wielding Alun has also battled testicular cancer, losing a testicle to the disease . But judges said Alun stood out during the macho contest because of his bravery in speaking out about his struggles with testicular cancer in 2006. And women will be glad to hear the newly crowned ultimate man is still single and looking for love. Alun, from Crewe, Cheshire, said: 'I'm thrilled to have won the title of Britain's Manliest Man. 'The main reason I entered the competition is because the cause is something that really resonates with me. 'I do a lot of manly stuff but I know there are stronger, more muscly men out there. 'I think it was a combination of things, from all the sports I do and my job, through to the fact I was prepared to speak out about what had happened to me. 'I found out first-hand how vital it is to be aware of the early signs of testicular cancer, and if I hadn't known what to look out for then I might not be here today. 'I was diagnosed in the July of 2006 and by the October I was back flying again because they caught it early. Alun, here on holiday in Italy, recreating the scene from James Bond, speaks openly about his experience with cancer, encouraging other young men to check regularly and know the signs . 'After having the testicle removed, I only needed one dose of chemo and that was fine. To be honest, I've felt worse after a hangover than I did after my dose of chemo. 'I'm chuffed to have been given the title. I got about 23,000 votes and the person in second place got about 11,000 so it was a real confidence boost for me. 'But the best thing about it has been the men and their girlfriends coming up to me and saying after seeing me talk about my experience of the disease they have now started checking too.' The eligible bachelor now lives next to RAF Cranwell, Lincolnshire, and works at the base as a Flight Commander for the Initial Officer Training school. He is also a qualified coach with the RAF Boxing Association, the Deputy Chairman of the RAF Martial Arts Association, and practices Japanese sword fighting. The bachelor works at the RAF Cranwell base as a Flight Commander for the Initial Officer Training school . The competition was run jointly by men's grooming brand The Bluebeards Revenge, Men's Fitness magazine and male cancer charity Orchid. They launched the campaign in August to find the most masculine male in the UK with the aim of increasing awareness of testicular cancer. More than 1,000 people entered the competition, and representatives from the companies that created the campaign whittled those entrants down to a shortlist of 40 men. The public were then able to vote online from the start of November for who they believed deserved the macho accolade most. The winner was to be given a year-long role as an ambassador for the Orchid charity and be given a modelling contract as the face of Bluebeards Revenge. Nick Gibbens, spokesman for Bluebeards Revenge, said: 'We had a vast number of entries to the competition, and there were some really strong candidates boasting all manner of manly jobs, muscular physiques and macho hobbies. 'But what makes Alun a real winner in our eyes is his bravery in speaking out about his own experiences with testicular cancer. 'He is living proof that suffering the disease and receiving treatment for it will result in no loss of manliness whatsoever. 'He was the only man to make the short-list who has actually mentioned having testicular cancer, and he ended up getting a lot of female attention during the voting process through social media. 'I think it helped that he is still single, but he ended up winning the competition comfortably.'","Flight Lieutenant works as a Fast Jet Weapons System officer for the RAF .

"This year has been one of highs and lows for Hilary Clinton. The former first lady and senator became a grandmother for the first time after her daughter Chelsea gave birth, but she was also the cover of People magazine's lowest-selling issue. According to a report from AdWeek on Monday, the issue of People featuring Clinton was worst selling of 2014 with 503,890 copies sold. Hillary Clinton was on the cover for People magazine's worst selling issue this year . The June 16 cover, featuring Clinton wearing a salmon pink tunic and a bright turquoise beaded necklace, attracted attention when it was published because of Clinton's stance. Conservative blogger Matt Drudge floated the idea that Clinton was holding a walker in the picture. When contacted by Business Insider,  Nancy Valentino, a senior vice president of communications at Time Inc., which owns People, replied: 'Secretary Clinton is standing next to a patio chair in the backyard of her home where the photo shoot took place! 'I have also attached another photo from the shoot - thanks for checking in on this.' The magazine's best-selling issue - 1,169,800 copies - was the one featuring Robin Williams after his death in late August . The magazine's best-selling issue - 1,169,800 copies - was the one featuring Robin Williams after his death in August. Clinton's book Hard Choices, which detailed her time as secretary of state under Obama, also did not sell as well as anticipated - Clinton was reportedly paid a whopping $14 million advance. But it's not all bad news  - a poll has revealed Clinton is the early frontrunner in the 2016 presidential election. Although the former Secretary of State has yet to announce her candidacy, 50 per cent of American voters have said they can see themselves supporting her if she runs. Mrs Clinton, 67, has said she will make her decision on whether or not to run for the White House 2016 early next year. The poll found that half of voters support another Clinton president, while 48 per cent oppose it. Despite only a small margin of support, hers is significantly stronger than that of any rumoured Republican nominees. One reason for this could be that Ms Clinton, a former first lady and New York senator  is viewed as the likely Democratic nominee if she runs with few other candidates seen as competition. This becomes clear when polling only Democratic voters, where 82 per cent said they could see themselves supporting her if she runs, and only 15 per cent saying they cannot. One likely Republican opponent Jeb Bush, who announced that he is 'actively exploring' running for President 2016, only has a 31 per cent support, the poll by NBC News/Wall Street Journal said. Republican nominee 2012 Mitt Romney fared marginally better with 33 per cent saying they could see themselves supporting him. Frontrunner: Half of American voters would support Hillary Rodham Clinton for president if she decides to run for office in 2016, a poll has found . However, 57 percent say they could not support Jeb Bush, the younger brother of George W., while a full 60 per cent said they would not be backing Romney. Mr Bush took one step further towards the Republican nominee contest yesterday when he announced on Facebook that he will he will 'actively explore the possibility of running'. Many, both rivals and experts, saw his statement as a de facto announcement that ends months of speculation about his intentions. The son and brother of presidents, 61-year-old Former Florida Governor Jeb Bush is the early favorite of the Republican establishment wing. His move puts immediate pressure on other establishment-minded GOP contenders to start competing with him for donors, campaign staff and national attention in a crowded field of potential contenders. In a race likely to include fiery conservatives such as Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas and former neurosurgeon Ben Carson, Bush will occupy the middle ground despite his overwhelmingly conservative record as Florida's chief executive from 1999 to 2007. He also gives his party a powerful tool for courting the nation's surging Hispanic population. Bush is married to a Mexican-American, speaks Spanish and has been among the GOP's most outspoken advocates for an immigration overhaul, including a pathway to citizenship for immigrants who are living in the country illegally. Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren again said yesterday that she's not running for president, regardless of pleas from the progressive base for her to seek the Democratic nomination in 2016. 'You know, I'm just here to stand up for hardworking families who just want a fighting chance. 'That's what I'm in this fight for, and I'm in this fight all the way,' Warren told National Public Radio yesterday morning. The left-wing politician was careful not to say that she was 'never' running, however, leaving open the possibility of a future candidacy - potentially sooner than she's letting on publicly.","June 16 issue of People featuring Clinton sold 503,890 copies .

"A daughter is set to spend her first Christmas with her real father after 34 years apart. Claire Heard, 34, grew up in Kings Lynn, Norfolk, with her two sisters, Kelly, 31, and Faye, 28, believing another man was her father. It was only by chance at the age of 15 that she discovered the man she knew as dad was actually her step-father. Reunited: Claire with her biological father, John, who she didn't meet until she was 34 . She explains: 'I had a very happy childhood with her mother and father but my view of who I was and where I came from changed completely when I was 15. 'My sister found some paperwork in a cupboard by chance when she was tidying up. The documents showed that my name had been changed by deed poll when I was very little. We were mystified as to why that should have been the case. 'When my mum arrived home, I confronted her about it and she told me my dad was not who I thought he was.' David Heard, who she knew as her father and had brought her up in a loving and caring home, was actually her stepdad and her two sisters were really her half sisters. Her mother, Susan, explained how she had met Claire's biological father, who called John Mundy, when she was 23 on a night out. He was from London but he had moved to Norfolk where he had opened an American diner. Shock discovery: Claire was 15 when she found out she has been raised by her stepfather . The couple had a relationship that resulted in Susan becoming pregnant with Claire but then they began to drift apart. John's father became unwell and so he moved back to London and after a few visits up to see his baby, he then lost contact with the family. Susan then met David when Claire was two and they married and had their two other daughters. Susan decided not to tell Claire that David wasn't her real father as she didn't want her to feel different or unhappy. On discovering the truth years later, Claire said she initially felt shocked and angry but then understood once her mother explained the situation and the decisions she had made. She said: 'I felt confused initially but just wanted to meet my dad and talk to him. I understood that both he and her mum had their reasons for the way things turned out so I really just wanted to meet him, talk to him and see if he wanted to get to know me.' Claire constantly thought about her real father and tried to track him down but she didn't know where to start. Years went by without any leads so she abandoned hope of ever finding him. Long lost family: Claire, centre, with John, will spend Christmas with her father and newly discovered half siblings - Maisie and George, right, and Daniel on the left . She started up her own hairdressing business and had two children of her own, Marley and Ava. Then this summer, while watching ITV show Long Lost Families on TV, she was inspired to have another go at looking for John. She started searching online and discovered the website, FinderMonkey, a professional UK tracing agency who specialise in reunited long lost friends, family and beneficiaries. She didn't have much to go on other than her father's name, date of birth and that he came from London. She gave all this information to FinderMonkey not really expecting to hear any more. But after a week, she had a call from the company to say they had found him. He was living in Hertfordshire where he was married with grown up children. Claire said: 'I couldn't believe it. I was quite nervous about calling him out of the blue but FinderMonkey was really helpful and supportive. They sent a letter on my behalf to him at his address in Hertfordshire. 'The letter arrived when my dad was on holiday in Egypt. His sister Tina, who was looking after the house for him while he was away, opened it. 'Tina called me and we chatted and she told me about the family. I found out I had half brothers and a half sister that I didn't even know about. 'My dad called when he got back from holiday and we were on the phone for hours talking and catching up. I've been up to stay with him and his lovely wife and children for the weekend and we talk on the phone every other day. 'I'm so excited that for the first time ever I'm going to see him for Christmas this year. The best present I can imagine!' She added she feels lucky that she has now two fathers in her life.","Claire Heard, 34, grew up believing another man was her father .

"The father of Malala Yousafzai has described how his entire family has been traumatized by the massacre of at least 132 children and 16 staff at a school in Peshawar, Pakistan. Education campaigner Ziauddin Yousafzai called the attack the 'extreme of extremism' and told how his wife Tor Pekai collapsed into unconsciousness for 15 minutes after hearing news of the attack. He added that he has never seen his Nobel Peace Prize-winning daughter Malala, 17, 'so sad and upset' after details of the slaughter emerged, adding that his family members' 'hearts are bleeding'. Mr Yousafzai's comments came as local media attacked the Pakistani government for the atrocity, saying Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif has wasted time trying to win the cooperation of the Taliban rather than cracking down on the group's terrorist activities. Condemned: Ziauddin Yousafzai (pictured with his Nobel Peace Prize-winning daughter Malala) said his entire family has been traumatized by the massacre of at least 132 children and 16 staff at a school in Peshawar . Trauma: Education campaigner Ziauddin Yousafzai called the attack the 'extreme of extremism' and told how his wife Tor Pekai collapsed into unconsciousness for 15 minutes after hearing news of the attack . Horror: Nobel Peace Prize winner Malala Yousafzai has released a statement condemning the attack as 'atrocious and cowardly' adding: 'I am heartbroken by this senseless and cold blooded act of terror' Mr Yousafzai condemned yesterday's sickening slaughter of children at a school in Peshawar and said it was an unprecedented attack in Pakistan. 'Peshawar has been witnessing this kind of terror for the last many, many years, but what happened yesterday has no example in the history of Pakistan,' he told BBC Radio 4. 'When my daughter was attacked, the world turned into a dark hole for our family and I can imagine how much sadness and terror and horror the families will be passing through now,' he added. 'Schools should safe places for children... I'm afraid that if they [the Taliban] are not countered, we will see more horrible things in the future,' Mr Yousafzai went on to say. His comments came just a day after his Nobel Peace Prize winning daughter Malala released a statement condemning the attack as 'atrocious and cowardly'. 'I am heartbroken by this senseless and cold blooded act of terror in Peshawar that is unfolding before us,' she said. Malala added that she stood united with the government and armed forces of Pakistan, describing their efforts  to address the attack as 'commendable'. Depraved: The Taliban gunmen who slaughtered 148 innocent people, including 132 children, are pictured just hours before the massacre. The white banner they pose in front of is the flag of the Pakistani Taliban and reads: 'There is no God but Allah, and Muhammad is Allah’s Messenger’ In disguise: The photographs show the six heavily armed men wearing everyday clothing - a chilling disguise that meant security guards did not recognise them as being members of the Taliban . Armed: Released by the terror group's spokesman Mohammad Khurasani the third image shows the same group of men wearing full military fatigues - an outfit that would outed them as Taliban to security guards . Terror leader: Maulana Fazlullah - the firebrand militant, whose thick black beard reaches halfway down his chest - took control of the Pakistani Taliban 13 months ago . Accused: Pakistani media has partially blamed the Pakistani government for the atrocity, saying Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif (pictured) has wasted time trying to win the cooperation of the Taliban . Mr Yousafzai explained his fears over Pakistan's ability to counter the Taliban, saying that although political parties make comments pledging a united front against terror in the aftermath of such atrocities, these promises tend to fall apart once the reality and difficulty of doing so hits home. 'The Taliban doesn't know anything about condemnation. The more you condemn them, the worse they are, the more violent they are,' he said. His comments came as Prime Minister Nawaz declared that his government can no longer claim there are 'good' elements within the Pakistani Taliban and would now be targeting the group in its North Waziristan stronghold without discrimination. Dismissing claims that Pakistan had supported elements within the Taliban that it considered to be less of a security threat,  he said: 'No non-state actor is being backed by the government.' His statement came after local media said the Pakistani government had to take some of the blame for the atrocity. An editorial in The Nation read: 'The truth is this: Not just terrorists, but everyone, from the wider population to the civil and military leadership is responsible for the barbarity our children were subjected to.' The newspaper went on to accuse Nawaz of doing 'absolutely nothing towards building a narrative against extremism' and said he had no 'meaningful political ownership' of anti-Taliban operations. The editorial also accused the Pakistani Army of refusing 'to employ a blanket policy against non-state actors and continuing 'to protect sectarian elements'. Harrowing: A blood-splattered doorway leading to an auditorium at the school in Peshawar, with spectacles on the floor belonging to one of the victims of the massacre . Shocking: The scene of the final gun battle between the jihadists and Pakistani soldiers . Devastation: Mrs Kazi's office, where a terrorist blew himself up during a nine-hour rampage . Horror: This morning the first devastating images emerged of the blood-soaked classrooms where 132 innocent children and nine teachers were massacred by the Taliban . Elsewhere The Express Tribune appeared to criticise Imran Khan for having earlier proposed 'peace talks' with the Pakistani Taliban, adding that he had not effectively condemned the Taliban. The newspaper referred to Khan as someone who had 'havered and equivocated, who offered mealy-mouthed justifications for appalling acts of terror.' Another Pakistani newspaper, the Daily Times, said: 'There is no way the country and its leadership can let this one go; there is no way a solid, chapter-turning decision cannot be made after what is, no doubt, a national tragedy.' 'The government and military must understand once and for all that we are at war,' the newspaper added, demanding a 'a final end to this terror' following what it branded 'the blackest day we have ever lived through.' A Pakistani woman holds up a placard showing a number of the victims of the savage Taliban attack . Tragic: Among the victims of the slaughter are  (from left to right)  Talha Munur Paracha, Rafiq Bangash, Hassan Javed Khan and Muhammad Yasseen . Victims: Rafiq Bangash (left) and Mubeen Shah Afreedi (right) were among the children slaughtered by jihadis . Murdered: Mubeen Shah Afreedi and Mohammad Ali were slaughtered by the Taliban in Peshawar . Friends took to social media to pay tribute to Amish Salman, who was among the murdered Class 9 pupils . This morning horrifying pictures emerged showing the Taliban gun squad who slaughtered the innocent children as it was revealed the terror group is planning more attacks at schools in Pakistan. Released by the terror group's spokesman Mohammad Khurasani, the photographs show six heavily armed men posing in front of a white Islamic banner shortly before the attack in Peshawar. In an email released this morning, Khurasani attempted to justify the attack by claiming that said the Pakistani army has long killed the innocent children and families of Taliban fighters. He vowed more such militant attacks and told Pakistani civilians to detach themselves from all military institution, adding: 'We are still able to carry out major attacks. This was just the trailer.' In the email, the terror group warned Muslims to avoid places with military ties, saying it attacked the school to avenge the deaths of children allegedly killed by soldiers in tribal areas. Three photographs of the murders were released by the Pakistani Taliban this morning. The group are seen wearing full military fatigues and posing in front of a white banner daubed with religious slogans. Following the release of the photographs, authorities in the capital Islamabad issued a letter calling on schools to increase security and to check underneath buses and other vehicles.","Ziauddin Yousafzai said family is traumatized by the Peshawar massacre .

New menu labeling rules from the Food and Drug Administration will require chain restaurants with 20 or more outlets to list the amount of calories in alcoholic drinks, along with other foods, on menus by next November. The idea is that people often don't know — or even think about — how many calories they are imbibing. Caloric impact: A new FDA rule will require U.S. restaurants with over 20 outlets  to list nutritional information for alcoholic beverages including beer and cocktails . But the rules don't apply to drinks ordered at the bar or any drinks that aren't listed on the main menu. The wine list will also be guilt-free — individual calorie amounts aren't required there either. And unlike other beverages and foods, most bottles and cans of alcohol don't have to list full nutritional information. After years of lobbying for more nutritional information on alcoholic beverages, public health advocates say the menu labeling rules are a first step. 'Alcoholic beverages are a key contributor to the calories Americans are consuming, and most of the time when people have a drink they have absolutely no idea what its caloric impact is,' says Margo Wootan of the Center for Science in the Public Interest. Her group petitioned the government more than a decade ago to require that bottles and cans be labeled with robust nutritional information. The FDA's proposed menu labeling rules in 2011 exempted alcohol. But FDA Commissioner Margaret Hamburg said the agency decided to include it in the final rules this year after those who commented on the rule were largely in favor of such labeling because of its potential impact on public health. The beer, wine and spirits industries objected, arguing that they were regulated by the Treasury Department, not the FDA, a setup that dates back to Prohibition. Treasury's oversight, which includes minimal input from FDA, has 'well served the consuming public,' a coalition of alcohol groups wrote in a 2011 comment asking to be left out of the menu labeling rules. The new rules are designed to not be too burdensome for the alcohol industries or restaurants. Endless combinations of mixed drinks won't have to be labeled at bars, unless they are listed on a menu, and the FDA is allowing restaurants to use estimates of calories and ranges of calories without listing the exact amount in every different drink. That means menus are required to list the average amount of calories in a glass of red or white wine, but won't have to list calories by every brand of wine on the wine list unless they choose to do so. Same with beers and spirits. So most wineries and craft breweries selling to chain restaurants won't have to pay to have their products' nutritional content analyzed — for now, at least. Exempt: Unlike other beverages, most bottles and cans of alcohol won't have to list full nutritional information . The labeling rules have 'more of an indirect effect on our business,' says Wendell Lee of the California-based Wine Institute. Lee says brand-specific menu calorie labels could be especially burdensome on the wine industry, where every vintage and varietal is different. Craft brewers, with many varied brands and styles, have similar concerns. The regulations 'could have a slight chilling effect' on small breweries if some restaurants decide to list calories for individual beers, said Paul Gatza of the Brewers Association, which represents craft breweries. The rules could have advantages too, he said. 'The more customers know about a brewery, the more they feel connected with it,' Gatza said. Sourced from Rethinking Drinking . Off the menu, labeling rules appear further away. For years, most alcohol companies have tried to put off mandatory bottle and can nutrition labeling as public health advocates have fought for it. Rules proposed in 2007 would have made such labels mandatory, but Treasury never made the rules final. Last year, Treasury's Alcohol and Tobacco Trade and Tax Bureau said for the first time that beer, wine and spirits companies could use labels that include serving size, servings per container, calories, carbohydrates, protein and fat per serving. The labels are voluntary and will likely be used mostly by liquor companies touting low calories and low carbohydrates in their products. Current labeling law for bottles and cans is complicated. Wines containing 14 percent or more alcohol by volume must list alcohol content. Wines that are 7 percent to 14 percent alcohol by volume may list alcohol content or put 'light' or 'table' wine on the label. 'Light' beers must list calorie and carbohydrate content. Liquor must list percent alcohol content by volume and may also list proof, a measure of alcoholic strength. Wine, beer and liquor manufacturers don't have to list ingredients but must list substances people might be sensitive to, such as sulfites, certain food colorings and aspartame. Tom Hogue of the Tobacco Trade and Tax Bureau said the current goal is to make sure that companies that want to label may do so, and that labeling is consistent. It is important that labels 'don't mislead the consumer,' he said.","The new FDA ruling will come into effect next November and will apply to chain restaurants in the U.S. with 20 or more outlets .

"Two children have died and a nine-year-old is fighting for his life after he took his mother's car for a joyride in rural Mississippi and smashed into a utility pole. Three-year-old Brayden Traxler and his 13-year-old uncle, Justin Harrell, died after they were ejected from the car as it was being tailed by police in Hillsboro on Friday, WAPT reported. The boy behind the wheel, Justin's adopted brother, Ty'Jun Thigpen, was rushed to hospital, along with Justin's twin sister, 13-year-old Breckon Harrell. Ty'Jun is in critical condition and is still fighting for his life, while Breckon was treated for minor injuries and has since left the hospital. Scroll down for video . Tragic: Three-year-old Brayden Traxler (left) and his 13-year-old uncle, Justin Harrell (right) were killed after Justin's adopted brother took their mom's car for a joyride and crashed into a utility pole . Injured: The driver, Ty'jun Thigpen (left), and Justin's twin, Breckon Harrell (right), were taken to hospital . Authorities say the nine-year-old boy managed to get his mother's car keys and the three other children climbed into the car with him before he drove off, NBC12 reported. When Ty'Jun neared a mandatory checkpoint on Highway 35 and saw blue flashing lights, he tried to avoid Mississippi Highway Patrol officers by racing away, police said. But an officer saw the car, a 2003 Mercury Sabe,  and chased it to see why it avoided the checkpoint. The car raced across a supermarket parking lot before veering off the road, overturning and smacking into a utility pole, Sergeant Andy West, a highway patrol spokesman, said. The vehicle hit the pole so hard that it snapped. None of the occupants were wearing seat belts, West said. All four children lived in the same house. WAPT reported that the driver was the twins' adopted brother, while the three-year-old was their nephew. 'Any accident that someone loses their life is tragic, but when you're dealing with children it just makes it that much more tragic,' he said. Scene: When they neared a police checkpoint, they tried to avoid it and sped away. A trooper took chase and the nine-year-old boy lost control of the car and smashed into this utility pole, snapping it . Wreck: Car parts can be seen in the field where the youngsters crashed late on Friday night . Loss: Brayden, left, and Justin, right, were ejected from the car as it was being tailed by police . Authorities have refused to say how the young boy managed to get his keys, although comments on social media suggested the children were being watched by their grandmother but crept out of the house in the night while she was sleeping. The twins' mother told WAPT that she is not blaming anyone for the crash, which she called a 'freak' accident. Lee said that if the officer had not chased the car, things could have ended even worse. 'The two that were critically injured - at any time that car it could have been totaled,' he said. 'Luckily the trooper found them.' MHP is investigating the crash, which occurred about 45 miles east of Jackson, Mississippi. 'They were good people,' Charles Porter, a family friend, told WAPT. 'It's just a tragedy. My heart goes to the parents and their loved ones and I'm sorry that it happened.'

"A nine-year-old boy was starved, beaten and tied up while being kept as a slave at a coal yard, after his parents failed to repay a loan. Photographs that appeared in the local media show the unnamed child bound to a metal pillar with his arms tied above his head at the yard just outside of New Delhi. Local police declined to comment on the pictures but said they were currently looking for a man suspected of kicking a boy he was keeping as a child slave after his parents were unable to pay a debt. Photographs that appeared in the local media show the unnamed nin-year-old child bound to a metal pillar with his arms tied above his head at the coal yard just outside of New Delhi . The practice of taking so-called bonded children as a guarantee against the parents paying off a debt is increasingly common, despite the fact is illegal in India. It is little more than slave labor with the child often working unregulated hours in factories or farms. Neighbors freed the little boy after they heard him screaming while enduring an hour-long beating with a stick, and they chased the man off and called the police. The child said he was starving because his employer had not given him food for more than four days and had beaten him with a cane after tying him to a pole. He said: 'I was beaten because I had asked for Rs 50 (90 cents) from the owner to buy some food.' Police are currently looking for the coal depot owner, named as 57-year-old Net Ram. The child said he was starving because his employer had not given him food for more than four days and had beaten him with a cane after tying him to a pole . But detectives said that when they went to the man's house in the city of Ghaziabad near the New Delhi border he and his family had vanished. The Indian Express said that the pictures had been taken by its photographer who was in the area, and confirmed they were genuine. In India, coal is offered to the poor at a subsidized rates by some depot owners who will also accept bonded children - whose parents had taken loans but not paid them back - in order to pay off the debt.","Nine-year-old was starved, beaten and tied up while being kept as a slave .

"A group of second grade students protesting the deaths of Michael Brown and Eric Garner staged a demonstration outside their Massachusetts school on Friday. The 20-odd group of students, aged 7 and 8 years old, held signs that read 'Honk if you want justice' and 'Please don't shoot me, Ferguson' and chanted on the sidewalk beside Alma Del Mar Charter School in New Bedford. The peaceful event was held during 11:30 recess, but one parent – a local police officer – has complained and accused the school of being 'anti-police'. Scroll down for video . The 20-odd group of students, aged 7 and 8 years old, held signs that read 'Please don't shoot me, Ferguson' on the sidewalk beside Alma Del Mar Charter School in New Bedford on Friday . George Borden says he found out about the event after a friend noticed his seven-year-old daughter among the protesters and called him. Students had been sent home last Wednesday to a note alerting parents about a class discussion about race, diversity and the deaths of Eric Garner in Staten Island, New York, and Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, at the hands of the police. The school says the note gave parents the chance to opt out. The note didn't mention the protest, because it was an idea the students came up with in class - however Officer Borden, 15-year veteran, isn't buying that explanation. 'I don't think 7-year-olds can come up with the idea to go out and protest on the street,' he told the Boston Globe. He says he found a flyer in his daughter's backpack urging people to join a weekend protest 'against the unjust systems that allow police officers to kill Black men and boys with impunity.' Officer George Borden says he found out about the protest after a friend noticed his seven-year-old daughter among the protesters. He has accused the school of being 'anti-police' Borden told WHDH that the note was 'horrific to me' and that his daughter asked him, 'Daddy, do you shoot people?' He is demanding an apology from his daughter's teacher. Will Gardner, the school's founder and executive director, has said he stands by the decision to let the kids protest as it was part of a lesson in civics. 'We discourage our teachers from sharing their own political and religious views with their scholars,' Gardner added. '[But] we certainly want our scholars to engage in activities that help them to understand what it means to be citizens and what it means to be a democracy.' Yasmin Flefleh-Vincent, who's son Rye is in the same second-grade class, has she said she had no problem with the students demonstrating on the sidewalk. 'Never at once did I feel as though there was' an inappropriate tone,' she told the Globe. 'I appreciate the conversation and the discussion at school. I think it's a relevant topic and I respect the teacher.' The students who held Friday's protest belonged to Shabrina Guerrier’s class, left, but first they had had to asked Emily Stainer, right, the school head, if they could . Will Gardner, the school's founder and executive director, has said he stands by the decision to let the kids protest as it was part of a lesson in civics . Borden claims that incident like this make his job as a policeman even more difficult. ‘Having the children off school property without any parental permission slip is inexcusable,’ he said. ‘I found that extremely upsetting, multiple people I've spoken to felt the same way, I've shown them pictures of this.’ Gardner said the pupils from Shabrina Guerrier’s class were told they couldn't do anything that would be anti-police or anti-any other group and had also asked the head of school, Emily Stainer, for permission. 'Obviously, their safety was our first concern, said Stainer. Gardner also said the protest was completely voluntary and other students who didn’t take part were playing and having normal recess while the protest went on. He has also spoken with Officer Borden, who has agreed to meet with both the teacher and school administrators to discuss his concerns and come up with productive next steps.

"'Killer': Stephen Rozniakowski allegedly shot dead his ex-girlfriend and wounded her daughter Monday . A police officer broke into an ex-girlfriend's house and shot her dead before wounding her 15-year-old daughter - just hours after the woman was granted an order of protection against him. Stephen Rozniakowski, an officer with the Colwyn Borough Police Department in Pennsylvania, allegedly gunned down Valerie Morrow, who broke up with him in August, at her home in Glenolden on Monday night. Just hours before she was killed, Morrow told anNBC10 reporter that Rozniakowski, 32, had been sending her threatening messages, and said: 'If you find me dead, he did it.' After Rozniakowski broke into the house and gunned down the 40-year-old mother-of-two, he allegedly shot her teenage daughter, Bridgette Cruz, in the bicep before she fled to her room. Morrow's husband, Tom, himself a cop for Morton Borough, was also inside the house at the time and awoke to hear gunshots. He grabbed his gun from the nightstand and shot at the intruder. He shot Rozniakowski, who was wearing a bullet-proof vest, multiple times but did not kill him, the DA told the Philadelphia News. When Mr Morrow heard the gunman re-loading his weapon, he jumped out of a second-story window, breaking his ankle. Despite the pain, he ran to a neighbor's house to call 911. Back in the house, Cruz left her bedroom and saw Rozniakowski in the hallway with his gun to his head - but she hit it out of his hand and then escaped from the house, authorities said. Gunned down: Valerie Morrow, right, was shot dead just hours after she was granted an order of protection against Rozniakowski. He also allegedly shot her teenage daughter, Bridgette, left, in the arm . As Morrow called 911, Rozniakowski reported himself over the Delaware County police radio. 'I'm unarmed,' he told the dispatcher, who asked to know who the suspect - or 'actor'- was. 'I am the actor,' Rozniakowski responded. Mrs Morrow, who was also an officer, was pronounced dead when authorities arrived on the scene, and Bridgette and her stepfather were taken to hospital for treatment. Rozniakowski is in critical but stable condition at Crozer-Chester Medical Center. Delaware County District Attorney Jack Whelan told the Philly News that Mr Morrow's quick-thinking may have stopped Rozniakowski from killing all three. 'He went there to execute the entire family, in my opinion,'  Whelan told NBC10. 'I have no doubt.' Rozniakowski has been charged with first-degree murder and related offenses. 'We are looking at this as a potential death-penalty case,' Whelan said. Injured: Her husband, Tom Morrow, who is also a police officer, jumped out of window and broke his ankle but still managed to run to a neighbor's to call 911. He was taken to hospital with his stepdaughter, right . NBC reported that just hours before her death, Morrow had reached out to reporter Harry Hairston - who had previously reported on Rozniakowski - and told him she dated the police officer for months before ending the relationship in August to reunite with her husband. But afterwards, he bombarded her with calls and texts, sometimes with threatening messages. On Monday, she obtained an order of protection. The Morrows also believed that Rozniakowski had scratched their new jeep last week. 'She feared for her life. She feared for her family's life,' a friend told WPVI. The order was delivered to the house Rozniakowski shared with his mother and brother around 6pm on Monday. After the order was granted, his service weapon was removed and he was put on administrative leave. He used a private weapon in the killing, police said. On Monday evening, he resigned his position with the Colwyn Police Department. Rozniakowski's attorney, Marty Mullaney, said he had spoken to both his client and Morrow before the shooting on Monday in an attempt to diffuse the situation. Scene: Rozniakowski, who has a history of harassment charges, allegedly broke into her home in Glenolden (pictured) on Monday night, just hours after he was served the order of protection and quit his job . 'He said he just wanted to chat with her,' Mullaney said. In a separate case, his former fiancee accused him of texting her and calling her - sometimes more than 100 times a day - and had also taken out an order of protection against him. He was charged with 25 counts of stalking and 50 counts of harassment in that case and was due in the court on Thursday. Court records show he was also found guilty of harassment in 2009 and 2010. Despite the convictions and his recent arrest, Rozniakowski stayed with the Colwyn department. His weapon was also removed following the charges earlier this year. Colwyn Police Chief Bryan Hills had told the Delaware County Daily Times in April that he thought many of the allegations were 'bulls***'.","Stephen Rozniakowski, who worked for Colwyn Police in Pennsylvania, shot Valerie Morrow, 40, dead and shot her daughter in the arm on Monday .

"A student in upstate New York has won the right to have a photo of her posing with a rifle included as her senior portrait in the yearbook. Rebekah Rorick, who attends Broadalbin-Perth High School, said she wanted to cry when the yearbook committee initially turned down her photo.

It's my favorite photo of all time right now.' She denies that she was trying to be controversial and says she simply wanted to express herself as other students were allowed to do. Rorick and her dad took her case to the Board of Education on Monday night and argued that the photo was no different from many other senior portraits that highlight student interests. They were also able to present a 2012 yearbook photo which showed a past senior holding a rifle beside a deer.

Rorick denies that she was trying to be controversial and says she simply wanted to express herself as other students were allowed to do . 'She is not holding the gun in a malicious manner. She is not pointing it anywhere. 'It's to me, in my opinion, a nice photograph of a young lady in the Adirondack region that enjoys hunting,' he told News10.

"A woman has participated in a nude photo shoot after getting out of an unfaithful, tumultuous marriage, conquering a debilitating illness, and losing a hundred pounds. Stephanie Athena-Marie, 29, of Crestone, Colorado, allowed  photographer Beth Sanders to shoot her as part of journalist Shannon Bradley-Colleary's Love Your Body Now: Healing Body Image Issues Through Fine Art Nudes series. She also received life-coach services from Marlene Zaleznick as part of the project. Ms Athena-Marie credits her miraculous weight loss to a 'return to emotional health' she experienced after moving to Colorado to 'be closer to nature' following her divorce. Scroll down for video . Full of joy! Following her divorce, Ms Athena-Marie moved to Colorado, where she lost 100 pounds without even altering her exercise and diet. She attributes the loss to her 'return to emotional health' Not ashamed! Ms Athena-Marie said she decided to pose nude 'to show myself that my physical body didn't have to be an obstacle to me living a life I love' For years, Ms Athena-Marie was ravaged by the effects of Hidradenitis Suppurativa (or 'HS'), a non-contagious illness that causes size-able, painful lumps to form under the skin. The lumps frequently result in lesions and scarring, making her decision to bare it all that much more significant. Her HS is worsened by stress - and was exacerbated during her year and a half long marriage to her ex-husband, who occasionally wouldn't want to touch her because of her illness. 'HS people who aren't already in relationships find it difficult to begin new relationships because of what other people will think,' she said. She found out he was cheating on her - and when she went to file divorce papers, she discovered he had filed separation papers a year earlier. 'I could either drink and whore myself out for the rest of my life or I could get up, get angry, cry and figure out why this happened,' she said. She opted for the latter and moved to Colorado, to 'be closer to nature.' Proud! Since her early twenties, Ms Athena-Marie has suffered from Hidradenitis Suppurativa - a disease that caused the scars visible under her arms and on her breasts . Grin and bare it! The subject was nervous at first for her shoot, but felt at ease after the first few shots . Nesting! Ms Athena-Marie wasn't embarrassed about her scars being visible in the shots and said 'You can either fight it or welcome it. Either way, it is there' In Colorado, as she healed, she miraculously lost a hundred pounds - without altering her diet or exercise routines. At the same time, her HS flare-ups decreased to the point of almost disappearing entirely. 'Healthy/balanced feeding of my physical body as well as my mental, emotional and spiritual self is the key for my whole-body health and my relationship with HS,' she told MailOnline. Now, years later, Ms Athena-Marie is happy with her life -  and considers her decision to pose for nude photographs an expression of her 'blossoming.' Video courtesy of Stephanie Athena-Marie . Before the transformation! An old photo of Ms Athena-Marie, when she is 'at her heaviest' Taking a deep breath! Ms Athena-Marie loved 'being naked outdoors' and said she 'felt honored to share my body with the elements in such a natural way' Although she was nervous at first during the shoot, Ms Sanders quickly put her at ease. 'I loved being naked outdoors. It was such a beautiful sunny day - and yes I was so sunburnt afterwards,' she said. 'I have a deep connection with land, animals, trees and water so I felt honored to share my body with the elements in such a natural way.' After the pair had taken a few pictures, Ms Athena-Marie began suggesting different shots and 'asking to lay in the flowers or stand in the creek.' Her scars were but a passing thought - and she wasn't worried about them being visible in the photos. 'I have lived with those scars for many years now that I don't remember any different,' she said. 'When your body changes you can either fight it or welcome it. Either way, it won't change the fact that it is there.' Inner peace! Now that Ms Athena-Marie has 'returned to emotional health' her HS flare-ups are few and far between . A transformative experience! 'There is much more to us than just this body,' Ms Athena-Marie said. 'When we all realize this, we can begin to get to the real depth in our lives and connections.' Now that the photos are published for the world to see, Ms Athena-Marie doesn't regret taking part in the project - and has learned a lot about herself from the experience. 'The main reason I chose to participate in the project was to show myself that my physical body didn't have to be an obstacle to me living a life I love,' Ms Athena-Marie said. 'So many people, men and women, are afraid of their bodies. They put living on hold because of their fears and judgements.If more people would do what they want to do, what inspires and heals them, we would all see a world much different than the one we see now.' 'There is much more to us than just this body. When we all realize this, we can begin to get to the real depth in our lives and connections, and move on from the surface.'","Stephanie Athena-Marie, 29, credits her miraculous weight loss to a 'return to emotional health'

"Google has been attacked by a prominent US attorney general who claimed the internet giant has 'no conscience'. Jim Hood, the attorney general of Mississippi, said that Google does not care about the online safety of its customers, has no regard for the damage it does and is the worst of any company he has dealt with in his 10 years in the job. Mr Hood's attack is the latest salvo fired from a growing alliance of organisations targeting an adversary they have codenamed 'Goliath'. The office of Jim Hood, the attorney general of Mississippi (pictured), vowed to continue fighting Google and claimed it put its profits ahead of its customers' safety . The attack by Mr Hood was part of a report in the New York Times which revealed the alliance of opponents who are lining up against Google. The Motion Picture Association of America has supposedly been lobbying lawmakers because they claim Google is not doing enough to take down copyrighted material. Travel website Expedia and computer systems giant Oracle have also attacked Google for its sharp business practices. Google's opponents have also claimed that it is failing to censor illegal sites from search results. Mr Hood has aggressively pursued Google and in October issued a subpoena asking for records related to stolen credit card numbers and controlled substances. But a letter he wrote to the company in November last year, released by an open records request, made clear he feels very strongly about the company. The internet giant, which is headquartered in Mountain View, California (pictured), is coming under pressure from an alliance of groups with varying motives . Mr Hood said: 'In my 10 years as attorney general, I have dealt with a lot of large corporate wrongdoers. 'I must say that yours is the first I have encountered to have no corporate conscience for the safety of its customers, the viability of its fellow corporates or the negative economic impact on the nation which has allowed your company to flourish.' In a statement Mr Hood's office said: 'Google has put their profits ahead of the safety of children and families and this office will continue to fight them with all the expertise at our disposal'. The MPAA, which is Hollywood's trade group, said that it was lobbying against Google to 'protect our members and their creative works'. Spokeswoman Kate Bedingfield said: 'When wrongdoing is taking place online, we work with and support appropriate law enforcement officials, including the attorneys general, as do many other industries.'","Attorney general blasts internet giant for  having 'no conscience' in letter .

Weighing more than 20 stone, Stacie Watts, who was a size 26, was struggling to keep up with the demands of her four-year-old, Ellie-Mae. Endless rounds of hospital appointments, the 28-year-old suffered chest pains that left her fearing for her life. It was then she vowed to lose weight, for the sake of Ellie-Mae. To ensure she didn’t falter she set up a donations page and asked friends and family to sponsor her slim. Stacie Watts has lost seven stone and dropped six dress sizes after becoming concerned that her life would be cut short and her daughter, who has Down's syndrome, would be left without a mother . Weighing more than 20 stone, Stacie Watts, who was a size 26, was struggling to keep up with the demands of her four-year-old, Ellie-Mae . Her aim, to raise money for the Children’s Heart Surgery Fund at the hospital that  saved her daughter’s life. Today, after 12 months, Mrs Watts has shed seven stone and dropped to a size 14, raising more than £300 in the process. She said: ‘I’d always been big but the thought of dying and not being around for Ellie-Mae and the other children was keeping me awake at night. ‘I owed to her and the rest of the family to be the best mother I could be. ‘But I couldn’t even walk up the stairs without losing my breath and keeping up with all the hospital appointments was exhausting at my size. 'Now there’s no stopping me.’ Mrs Watts and husband Lee Watts, 29, a printer, already had one-year-old son Tyler when Ellie-Mae was born in December 2010. She was delivered 10 days overdue and not breathing. The newborn was rushed straight to special baby care where her breathing was stabilised but hours later doctors revealed she had Down’s syndrome. Mrs Watts, from Louth, Lincolnshire, said: ‘ It was such a huge shock. We had heard of Down’s syndrome but didn’t really know that much about it. 'Nothing had been picked up at any of the scans so it came completely out of the blue. ‘It made no difference to how we felt about our daughter, we loved her instantly but it was still a lot to take in.’ Ellie-Mae had been born with four holes in the heart, which meant she tired quickly and had trouble feeding. When the mother-of-three started to suffer chest pains she vowed to make a change to her diet . She said:  I’d always been big but the thought of dying and not being around for Ellie-Mae and the other children was keeping me awake at night. I owed to her and the rest of the family to be the best mother I could' Within 12 months Mrs Watts has dropped from 20 stone to 12 stone and lost six dress sizes, raising more than £300 for the children's hospital that saved Ellie-Mae's life in the process . The couple took her home at two weeks old but caring for her around the clock as well as her Tyler, took it’s toll on 20-stone Mrs Watts. She said: ‘Looking after a newborn is always tiring but Ellie-Mae’s extra needs including being tube fed left me exhausted. ‘My weight left me tired just putting my shoes on so I knew I had to do something.’ But their hectic schedule of hospital appointments meant she relied even more heavily on takeaway food. ‘I told myself I didn’t have the times to diet because there was barely enough time to shop let alone cook healthy meals from scratch,' she said. When she was six months old, on June 3, 2011 Ellie-Mae underwent urgent heart surgery at Leeds General Infirmary repair the four holes. After struggling to fit a conventional slimming club into her schedule she discovered an online plan perfect for busy mothers . Her terrified parents carried her to theatre for the five-hour operation knowing there was every chance they might lose her. Mrs Watts said: ‘We kissed her goodbye not knowing if we would see her alive again. It was horrific.’ The couple faced an anxious wait to hear if the operation had succeeded and finally the call came. ‘We just buckled with relief and I vowed then that I had to change for Ellie’s sake,' said Mrs Watts. 'If she could go through all that, I could lose some weight.’ But it was easier said than done and the family continued to live on junk food. Mrs Watts admits she used food as an emotional crutch. She said: ‘If it had been a hard day I would ""treat"" myself to a few bags of crisps and some chocolate when the kids were asleep.’ And there seemed little point dieting when she fell pregnant again with son Riley, now one. But when she started suffering chest pains last year, she realised action needed to be taken. ‘I’d always been told my weight would shorten my life but suddenly when I got the chest pains that really hit home. It was diet or die,' Mrs Watts said. ‘Dying just was not an option for me, all my kids needed me, but especially Ellie-Mae because she will most likely always live at home with us. ‘I had to make sure I was around for as long as possible to look after her. I needed to get into shape and got on top of my health for her. ‘Worrying about not being around for her was keeping me awake at night. I thought about all she had been through in her short life and that was my inspiration.’ After struggling to fit a conventional slimming club into her schedule she discovered an online plan perfect for busy mothers like her called the Terri-Ann 123 diet plan. It had been set up by a mother to offer help and support online to those too busy at attend a club. She decided to sign up after Christmas in January 2014 but the wake up call came soon than expected. She said: ‘ My father-in-law posted some pictures of me at a Christmas party on Facebook and I nearly died of shock when I saw myself on screen. ‘I looked horrendous and knew I could not waste another minute.’ She started with earnest but just to be sure she didn’t waver set up a donations page and asked friends and family to sponsor her weight loss to raise funds for the Children’s Heart Surgery Fund which supports the heart unit at Leeds General Infirmary. She said: ‘I knew I would be less likely to give in if others were relying on me.’ Breakfast: Huge bowl of cereal with full-fat milk . Snacks: Biscuits, crisps, full-fat coke . Lunch: Sandwich or roll with crisps, biscuits and full-fat coke . Dinner: Takeaway meal followed by more chocolate and crisps . Breakfast: An omlette . Snack: Fat-free yogurt . Lunch: A Terri-Ann 123 wrap . Dinner: A Terri-Ann 123 recipe suitable for the whole family, for example  chicken fajitas followed by another 123 recipe of cake and sugar-free jelly . Baby Ellie-Mae was born with four holes in her heart and had to undergo life-saving surgery when she was three years old, at Leeds General Infirmary . Her plan worked and she found the quick simple but healthy meals slipped easily into the family’s busy routine. ‘In many ways it was quicker than getting a takeaway which surprised me and a lot cheaper,' she said. 'All the meals on the Terri-Ann 123 are designed with the family in mind so it suited everyone. I had been kidding myself all along.’ The weight fell of even quicker than she had hoped and by September she had met her first target of losing five-and-a-half-stone and has now lost a total of seven stone. ‘I can long on to the Terri-Ann 123 diet plan facebook page for support or meal ideas whenever I want which suits me.’ She has gone from a size 26 and 20 stone 5lbs to a size 14, weighing 12 stone. But more importantly the improvement to her health has been dramatic. She said: ‘ I can keep up with all the children now. ‘I’m much more hands on, I can play at the park and go on rides with them but the biggest relief is the chest pains have stopped so I no longer lie awake at night worrying about dying and leaving the children.’ To donate to the Children's Heart Surgery Fund visit Mrs Watt's Justgiving.com page.","Stacie Watts, from Lincolnshire, weighed 20 stone and was a size 26 .

"Energetic: Jim Murphy, 47, is credited with helping to deliver a No vote in last week’s referendum after he launched a tour of 100 Scottish towns in 100 days . Jim Murphy is being lined up to take on Nicola Sturgeon at the next Holyrood election in a bid to revive Labour’s fortunes in Scotland. Westminster bosses want the former Scottish Secretary, currently Shadow International Development Secretary, to run for First Minister at the 2016 Holyrood election. There is disquiet in the party about the performance of current Scottish leader Johann Lamont in the wake of the Yes campaign’s victories in Labour’s heartlands of Glasgow, North Lanarkshire and West Dunbartonshire. Insiders claim she may not be leader by the next election. That would offer Mr Murphy the opportunity to stand for the leadership while still an MP – like Alex Salmond did with the SNP in 2004 – and then switch to the Scottish parliament. Mr Murphy is also likely to take control of the party’s campaign in Scotland at next May’s General Election. One Westminster source said he could be appointed Shadow Scottish Secretary at Ed Miliband’s next reshuffle, replacing Margaret Curran. Mr Murphy, a Blairite who represents East Renfrewshire, was a close ally of Mr Miliband’s brother David and he is unlikely to get his dream job of Foreign Secretary if Ed becomes Prime Minister. But party sources said Mr Miliband recognises the pivotal role Mr Murphy played in the referendum and would be happy to work with him as Scottish leader. Mr Murphy, 47, is credited with helping to deliver a No vote in last week’s referendum after he launched a tour of 100 towns in 100 days, speaking to thousands from a platform of Irn-Bru crates. He was forced to temporarily postpone the tour after being pelted with eggs but swiftly returned to the fray. Meanwhile, recriminations have started in Scottish Labour over the poll results in Glasgow and surrounding areas. One insider said the Holyrood party was ‘dysfunctional’ and had still not recovered from its 2011 Scottish election humiliation, which saddled the backbenches with ‘dead wood’. One high-profile Labour politician said: ‘I have never been so grateful for the Tories. They got their supporters out in middle-class areas and saved the Union, while our people were switching to Yes. ‘For the first time ever, I was so happy the turnouts in the schemes were lower than elsewhere.’ Although Glasgow narrowly voted Yes, the turnout was only 75 per cent – the lowest in the country. But it is still very concerning for Labour that the Yes camp won with 53.49 per cent in Glasgow, 51.07 per cent in North Lanarkshire and 53.96 per cent in West Dunbartonshire. In Miss Lamont’s own seat of Glasgow Pollok, the Yes vote was 53.9 per cent. Stiff opposition: Mr Murphy in Musselburgh High Street during his 100 town tour, where he was angrily heckled by a Tesco supermarket worker who spoke out in support of independence for Scotland . Across the country, a poll published by Lord Ashcroft last Friday suggests that 37 per cent of Scots who backed Labour in 2011 voted for separation. Labour did have some politicians who excelled, most notably Gordon Brown. Heir apparent: Nicola Sturgeon looks likely to lead the Scottish National Party into the 2016 elections to the regional assembly at Holyrood, Edinburgh . His future is unclear and he has still to decide if he will run again for his Kirkcaldy and Cowdenbeath seat next year. Better Together leader Alistair Darling was asked about his future at the weekend and said: ‘I am going to be making my mind up over the next couple of weeks or so. It would be a huge decision for me, whatever I decide to do.’ One Westminster insider said: ‘After those two, Jim Murphy is the stand-out performer. He is one of the best Scottish politicians for a generation and Ed has a huge degree of respect for what he did.’ The source added: ‘There are questions being asked about Margaret Curran. What did she do? She’s a street fighter, she could have been touring cities and towns. And many people don’t expect Johann to still be leading the party in Scotland in 2016.’ Mr Murphy would need to find a new seat to contest for the Holyrood election, as the MSP for the corresponding constituency – Ken Macintosh – is a close ally who he would want as part of his team. Glasgow Central MP Anas Sarwar is currently deputy leader of Scottish Labour but if Mr Murphy replaces Miss Lamont, his deputy would need to come from Holyrood. Rising stars such as Kezia Dugdale, Drew Smith and Jenny Marra would be favourite for this job.","Mr Murphy toured 100 towns in 100 days to campaign for a No vote .

"A crisis-hit hospital has been cleared of deliberately manipulating cancer waiting times - with a review finding any failings were the result of managerial incompetence, not corruption. Colchester Hospital in Essex, which is in special measures and was forced to declare a major incident last month, had been subject to two separate but related inquiries after concerns were raised by the Care Quality Commission (CQC), who inspect hospitals, in November last year. The first looked into alleged manipulation of cancer waiting times while the second focused on claims staff were bullied into changing data so that the hospital appeared to be meeting targets. While the review published today found no evidence of systematic data manipulation, it did find evidence of poor documentation and record-keeping and identified a number of patients who had experienced sub-optimal care, diagnosis or treatment. Scandal hit Colchester General Hospital (pictured) has been cleared of deliberately manipulating cancer waiting times in a report published today . The report said that it was impossible to establish the extent to which patients suffered as a result but there was evidence of clear harm to at least one patient. Dr Lucy Moore, chief executive of Colchester Hospital University NHS Foundation Trust, said she hoped the findings would allow staff to focus on improving services. She added: 'I welcome the publication of this report and I am very pleased there appears to be no evidence of systematic data manipulation at the trust. 'It is important that we now rebuild confidence in the cancer services provided here in Colchester. 'We apologise unreservedly to any of our patients who have suffered delays in treatment or diagnosis or who have received poor care. 'We have scrutinised the care of any patient where we think there might have been imperfect care and the trust is in contact with all of the patients who have suffered significant sub-optimal care. 'We are continuing to work with our health partners to improve the quality of our cancer services.' Allegations of bullying and waiting list manipulation at the Colchester Hospital University NHS Foundation Trust was passed to the Care Quality Commission (CQC) in the summer of 2013. On investigation the CQC identified “serious concerns” and said staff reported to the CQC that they were “pressured to change data… to make it seem people were being treated in line with national guidelines”. The Trust commissioned two reviews of the experience of a number of patients treated between April 2010 and March 2014 who may have been affected by misreporting. It found 16 cases of possible deliberate and inappropriate data entry but in none of these cases could the reviewers establish intent to deliberately falsify the figures. The review found a number of small discrepancies between recorded and actual patient data and concluded that these were most likely to be the result of minor, but erroneous interpretations of the guidelines governing cancer waiting times. These discrepancies sometimes made waiting times appear longer than in reality and sometimes shorter. While the review found no evidence of systematic, deliberate data manipulation it did find evidence of poor documentation and record keeping with multiple causes including data entry errors, misinterpretation of national guidance, operating process issues, poor information sharing and poor record keeping. It also identified a number of patients who had experienced suboptimal care, diagnosis or treatment. The retrospective review, commissioned by the trust, look at 822 cancer patients treated at the hospital between 2010 and 2014. It was launched after the CQC raised 'serious concerns' about staff being pressured to change data to make it seem people were being treated in line with national guidelines. Under national targets, patients with suspected cancer must start their treatment within 62 days of a GP referral. Any patient found to have cancer should start treatment within 31 days, according to the NHS National Operating Framework. Various specialities at the hospital, particularly those dealing with urology and lower gastrointestinal cancer, were at risk of breaching the required standard and it was alleged that data had been altered to address these concerns. The report found 16 cases of possible deliberate and inappropriate data entry but the reviewers could not firmly establish intent to deliberately falsify figures. The East of England Strategic Clinical Network, which reviewed the report, said: 'The overarching impression was there was evidence of inaccuracies in the cancer waits data but this was as likely to negatively impact on the trust's performance statistics as enhance them. 'This suggested the issue was one of effectiveness and competence in the cancer management team rather than a deliberate manipulation.' The independent inquiry into bullying and intimidation was commissioned under the instruction of health regulator Monitor, which oversaw the process. While some staff members had said they felt 'pressured' to manipulate data, the report said there had been no systematic culture of bullying. Adam Cayley, regional director at Monitor, said the report should 'bring a very difficult chapter in the history of this trust to a close'. The review did identify a number of patients who had received sub optimal care, diagnosis or treatment (file photo) 'It is reassuring to find that there is no evidence of staff being bullied into changing cancer data, but it is even clearer that there were serious managerial failures at the trust,' he added. 'The new management team at the hospital is already delivering improvements for patients - a process we expect to see continue.' Peter Wilson, the trust's chairman, said: 'Although this report found no evidence of a systemic culture of bullying, this trust takes bullying very seriously and will take prompt action wherever and whenever bullying is identified.' The trust said it had made a number of improvements to its cancer services over the last year. A spokesman said it had also made 'significant strides' in improving data collection and handling for cancer patients. The trust's cancer mortality statistics are now within the normal national range for NHS trusts in England. Bosses declared a major incident last month - which included cancelling operations and telling patients to stay away from A&E - after CQC inspectors said staff were under strain and patient care was suffering as a result. The trust has since resumed normal service after reducing the number of beds in its under-pressure Emergency Assessment Unit to allow staff to focus on priority cases.","Colchester Hospital in Essex has been the subject of two inquiries .

"Two Catholic midwives who refused to take any part in abortions because it would 'violate their conscience' cannot object to helping with terminations, the UK's highest court ruled today. Scottish NHS workers Mary Doogan and Connie Wood argued they are entitled to refuse to order, supervise or support staff or patients at any point during the abortion process on religious grounds. The Catholic Church opposes all abortions, even if the pregnancy is the result of a crime or puts the mother in danger because all life is sacred, including that of an unborn child. But the NHS and midwife groups said that the right to object - beyond the midwives' right to refuse to abort the child themselves - compromised care for patients. Landmark case: Catholic midwives Connie Wood, left, and Mary Doogan, right, demanded the right to refuse any involvement in abortion procedures but the Supreme Court has ruled that this cannot happen . In a seven-year court battle the Scottish midwives were backed by the Court of Session in Edinburgh who agreed they could conscientiously object to taking any part in terminations. They agreed that the right of conscientious objection 'extends not only to the actual medical or surgical termination but to the whole process of treatment given for that purpose'. 2007 - Catholic midwives Mary Doogan and Connie Wood became concerned at a decision to move all medical abortions to the labour ward at Southern General Hospital, Glasgow. As labour co-ordinators and midwives they had previously registered their conscientious objection to taking direct part in abortions, as allowed under the Abortion Act. 2012 - Ms Doogan and Ms Wood argued their supervision and support of staff involved directly in terminations amounted to 'participation in treatment' and breached their human rights. Judge Lady Smith at the Court of Session found the pair were sufficiently removed from any involvement to afford an appropriate respect of their beliefs. Ms Doogan and Ms Wood appealed the decision. April 2013 - Edinburgh court's Inner House overturned the decision and allowed the midwives to be completely separated from any part of the process . November 2014 - Supreme Court  hears an appeal brought by NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde. December 2014:  Five judges rule  that NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde's appeal should stand. But today five justices at the Supreme Court in London allowed an appeal by a health authority in Scotland against them. The health board argued that conscientious objection is a right only to refuse to take part in activities that directly bring about the termination of a pregnancy, not the support and care  process. Lady Hale, Lord Wilson, Lord Reed, Lord Hughes and Lord Hodge unanimously allowed the appeal today. The Royal College of Midwives (RCM) and British Pregnancy Advisory Service (bpas) had warned of the implications for services if the Court of Session decision was allowed to stand. The 'landmark' ruling was welcomed by the RCM and bpas. In a statement the two bodies said they intervened in the case because they believed 'such a broad and unprecedented interpretation of conscientious objection, applicable across the UK, would effectively have enabled a tiny number of staff opposed to abortion to make women's care undeliverable in many NHS settings'. Ann Furedi, chief executive of bpas, said: 'We welcome this ruling. Bpas supports the right to refuse to work in abortion care, not least because women deserve better than being treated by those who object to their choice. 'But the law as it stands already provides healthcare workers with these protections. Extending this protection to tasks not directly related to the abortion would be to the detriment of women needing to end a pregnancy and the healthcare staff committed to providing that care. 'There are enough barriers in the way of women who need an abortion without further obstacles being thrown in their way.' Ruling: It has taken seven years of court fights before the abortion case made it to the Supreme Court in London, pictured, the highest court in the land . Gillian Smith, RCM director for Scotland, said: 'This ruling is sensible and both women and midwives will welcome it. 'The ruling gives extensive definition to complex clinical and other situations, in regard to whether conscientious objection applies or not. The Abortion Act 1967 allows healthcare professionals to refuse to participate in direct involvement in abortion care, provided it is not an emergency case. Catholic midwives and labour ward co-ordinators, Mary Doogan and Connie Wood argued their objection should extend to supervising, delegating and support their colleagues who were directly caring for women having had terminations. The Royal College of Midwives and the NHS argued that  it would set a precedent that could 'compromise patient care' 'Midwives and other clinicians will benefit from this ruling's clarity and women will be able to continue to exercise their choice over their reproductive rights.' The case before the justices centred on the scope of the right to conscientious objection under the Abortion Act 1967, which provides that 'no person shall be under any duty ... to participate in any treatment authorised by this Act to which he has a conscientious objection'. Last April's appeal victory for the two women followed a ruling against them in 2012 in their action against NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde. In the previous appeal ruling in favour of the women, Lady Dorrian, with Lords Mackay and McEwan, said: 'In our view, the right of conscientious objection extends not only to the actual medical or surgical termination but to the whole process of treatment given for that purpose.' After that decision, Ms Doogan and Ms Wood said the ruling affirmed the rights of all midwives to withdraw from a practice that would 'violate their conscience'. The women were employed as labour ward co-ordinators at Southern General Hospital in Glasgow. At the time of the original ruling, Ms Doogan had been absent from work due to ill health since March 2010 and Ms Wood had been transferred to other work. Senior: The women were employed as labour ward co-ordinators at Southern General Hospital in Glasgow . Both registered their conscientious objection to participation in pregnancy terminations years ago, under the Abortion Act, but became concerned when medical terminations were moved to the labour ward in 2007. They said being called upon to supervise and support staff providing care to women having an abortion would amount to 'participation in treatment' and would breach their rights under the European Convention on Human Rights. In the original ruling against them, the judge, Lady Smith, found that the women were sufficiently removed from involvement in pregnancy terminations to afford them appropriate respect for their beliefs.","Midwives Mary Doogan and Connie Wood wanted no part in abortions .

They argued as Catholics being involved would 'violate their conscience'

"Coca Cola has been the top sponsor of American Idol since day one, from the crowning of Kelly Clarkson in 2002 up to the win of Caleb Johnson earlier this year. But after 13 seasons, the soft drink giant has ended its relationship with the talent show, announcing it is tome for the 'brand to venture into new spaces and pursue other opportunities'. The news comes on the back of a major reported drop in advertising spending, with figures falling from $781.9 million in 2012 to $394.7 million in 2014 - a loss of $387.2 million, according to Variety. It also follows confirmation the show will be 'merged' from two nights a week to one when it returns for its 14th series in January. Shock change: Coca-Cola, a mainstay brand on American Idol since its debut in 2002, has now pulled out of the show after 13 years . 'I can confirm that Coca-Cola and Fox have mutually decided to end our 13-year partnership,' a Coke representative  told E! News. 'After 13 years, we feel it is the right time for the Coca-Cola brand to venture into new spaces and pursue other opportunities to connect with teens and leverage music as a passion point.' The company would not further elaborate on its new plans for music marketing. AT&T, another longtime sponsor, also pulled its funding from Idol this year. Ratings for the once-insurmountable talent quest have progressively fallen over the years. For this year's winner's announcement and finale, 10.5 viewers tuned in. However at its peak, Idol commanded an audience of 38 million. That figure was registers when Ruben Studdard beat out Clay Aiken in season two. The show's host, Ryan Seacrest, recently revealed that, like So You Think You Can Dance and Dancing With The Stars, Idol will combine its performance and results shows into one. Host: Ryan Seacrest - seen here with Idol contestants in 2005 - recently revealed the show will go from two nights to one next year as part of a new format . The current judges - Jennifer Lopez, Keith Urban and Harry Connick Jr. - will all return. Lopez has been on the program for four years and Urban for three, while new recruit Connick Jr. is returning for his second season. 'Mentor' Randy Jackson, a former judge, has announced he is not returning. Idol will premiere on Wednesday January 7. Sources have told The Hollywood Reporter that Idol is close to signing off on a new sponsor to replace Coca Cola. Idol's other leading sponsor, Ford, has confirmed it will return in 2015. Flashback: Coke was been a leading sponsor on Idol since the first season in 2002, which Kelly Clarkson won . New precedent: The placement of Coke cups on the judge's tables during the first Idol season started a whole new wave of television advertising. Seen here is (L-R) Randy Jackson, Paula Abdul and Simon Cowell . According to Variety, the initial partnership between Coke and Idol was considered a 'huge risk'. Amid a major advertising interruption caused by digital television, Coke crossed what was a strong boundary at the time, putting cups on the Idol judge's tables and noticeable placements elsewhere on set. The move set a new precedent for brands to align themselves within a live show and one that proved beneficial for Coca Cola, until now. Current lineup: Keith Urban, Jennifer Lopez and Harry Connick Jr. will return  in 2015, but Coke won't .","Drink giant says it will 'pursue other opportunities to connect with teens'

"John Biehn, 39, of Southington, was charged twice on Monday for drink-driving and accused of shoplifting at a Wal-Mart early Tuesday . Playing strictly on the wrong side of the law, a former police officer in Connecticut was arrested three times in the space of 11 hours this week. John Biehn, 39, of Southington, was charged twice on Monday for drunk-driving and accused of shoplifting at a Wal-Mart early Tuesday. The string of offenses came after he appeared at Superior Court in Rockville on Monday for a drunken driving charge dating back to July 26. The Hartford Courant reports that after Biehn was released from the courthouse, he was spotted driving in the wrong lane on Route 83 in Vernon. Police stopped him in a McDonald's parking lot at around 1:30pm where he failed a sobriety check. He was released on a $2,500 bail apparently posted by his wife. But later in the day Biehn was stopped again and charged with the same crime in Wallingford, more than 30 miles away. Again, he posted $2,500 bond and was released. However, in the early hours of Tuesday he landed in trouble for a third time when a Wal-Mart in Wallingford called authorities and accused him of stealing a pair of headphones and food valued at $73. He was charged with sixth-degree larceny and released after posting $5,000 bail. Biehn is now due back in Rockville Superior Court for the new drunken-driving charge on December 22. His listed number rang unanswered Wednesday seeking comment. He left the Bridgeport police force after being convicted of reckless endangerment in 2006. Prosecutors said Biehn went on a drunken rampage at a housing complex in 2004, firing his gun at random and shooting out several windows. Three residents testified that Biehn pointed the gun at their heads and tried to shoot them. Others said Biehn fired at them but missed. He was acquitted of attempted murder and assault and received a suspended sentence. The city later agreed to pay $48,000 to settle a civil rights lawsuit filed by several residents of the housing complex.","John Biehn, 39, of Southington, was charged twice on Monday for drunk-driving and accused of shoplifting at a Wal-Mart early Tuesday .

"If anyone's nickname is ready for a change, it is Mel B's. Universally known as Scary Spice since coming to fame in a blur of leopard-print, wild curls and massive platform shoes, the 39-year-old from Leeds has recently undergone a style revolution that surely earns her the new moniker of chic. The X Factor judge puts it all down to her stylist Jason Bolde, who she says has 'done wonders' with her look. Scroll down for video . Chic Spice: The sleek new Mel B wore a stunning white sheer chiffon gown for Sunday's X Factor finale . Mel credits her stylist Jason Bolde, who's taken control of her clothes, for her new   pared-back look . Until her recent re-entry into the spotlight as talent show judge, Mel had remained faithful to her Scary Spice style roots with plenty of body-con dresses, animal prints, heavy make-up and midriff-baring tops. Speaking to Grazia, the formidable mother-of-three admitted that Bolde only agreed to work with her when she promised to follow his advice. ‘He wanted to give me a sleeker, more chic look, and he’s done wonders,’ she told the magazine. Mel is clearly pleased with her fashionable transformation, saying her stylist has 'done wonders'. Left: Her fashion tastes in 2002 were somewhat garish, while in 2010 (right) her style transformation was under way . Mel says former bandmate Victoria Beckham (here in her new London store) is 'an amazing businesswoman' As if to prove the point, in the accompanying shoot for the magazine, Mel smoulders in a series of stunning couture gowns, even donning a pair of angels' wings for one picture. Of late, Mel has appeared noticeably more stylish and pared-back, opting for a shiny bob or hair scraped off her face while clothes are fitted, well-cut and in flattering block colours. But don't put this down to a case of competition with her fellow judge Cheryl Versini-Fernandez, who she describes as 'a strong independent woman'. She said: 'I'm a girl's girl and Cheryl is lovely. How can you not love her?' The former Spice Girl also expressed her admiration for former bandmate Victoria Beckham's designs, praising her surprising sense of humour. 'She's witty as hell, very funny and an amazing businesswoman. I love her dresses.' Ab fab: Mel has ditched her old trademark, a crop top and low-slung bottoms showing off her toned tum . Victoria Beckham has  reinvented herself after leaving the girl-band that made her famous, founding a hugely successful clothing line that's  put her firmly on the fashion map. Meanwhile, Mel's earned a new generation of fans as the tough-talking  panel member on Simon Cowell's Saturday night singing competition. From crying at contestant's performances to responding to one fan gushing over Cheryl and ignoring her - 'what am I, chopped liver?' - Mel's authentic demeanour kept viewers tuning in. The full interview appears in this week’s Grazia magazine, on sale 16 – 29 December.

"Everybody knows a standard part of visiting a doctor involves sitting in the waiting room, thumbing through a terrible magazine, usually completely out of date and grubby with fingerprints. One doctor was so sick of hearing patients complaining that the reading material he provided was dull and old, he decided to get to the bottom of the matter. His research uncovered an uncomfortable truth: pilfering patients were to blame. His supposedly sick patients were stealing all the newer, gossipy reads in the waiting room and leaving only the older, more dry publications. In fact, he worked out that magazine theft could cost practices in the UK a whopping £12.6 million a year, assuming that each magazine costs £3.20 on average. A doctor carried out an investigation to find out why patients complained there were only old and dull magazines in his waiting room. He found half the magazines placed there in a month were stolen, equating to £12.6 million a year across all the practices in the UK . Professor Bruce Arroll, the beady-eyed doctor leading the research, said he carried out the study because he was flummoxed as to why patients kept complaining about the lack of up to date magazines in his waiting room, when he knew current copies had been ordered. Writing in the BMJ, he describes his confusion: ‘The reason for this phenomenon was clearly a burning research question, given the number of times that patients had complained.’ His initial, internet-based research, revealed no results. He said: ‘We searched Medline, Google Scholar, and grey literature for studies on missing magazines and on waiting rooms, but despite finding information on the design of waiting rooms, satisfaction with service based on the waiting room experience, and other waiting room related topics, there was nothing on the disappearance of magazines. ‘Evidence for the absence of up to date magazines was lacking and many of the articles that did mention magazines in waiting rooms said they were mainly old, consistent with our experience. He added: ‘Quantification of this phenomenon was urgently needed.’ After hypothesizing that either practice staff only put out the old magazines or they put out reasonably recent ones and these disappeared, he designed a study to settle the matter. Using his own office in Auckland, New Zealand, as a testing ground, he stocked the waiting area with a plethora of publications, old and new, gossipy and serious. The clinic staff were asked to leave the magazines alone, warned ‘any failure to comply could result in the death penalty’. ‘This warning was given to ensure that everybody understood the serious nature of the study,’ Professoe Arrol said. Gossip magazines with five or more celebrity photos on the cover were stolen 15 times faster than more serious publications . The 87 magazines were put out in three piles and marked with a unique number. Twice a week the principal investigator came into work half an hour early to record missing magazines. After 31 days, almost half (47 per cent) of the original 87 magazines had disappeared, the equivalent to 1.32 a day. All but one of the 27 'gossipy' magazines – those that had five or more photos of celebrities on the front cover - had disappeared. Within this group, 15 magazines were defined as ‘most gossipy’ as they had ten or more photographs of celebrities on the cover. They all went missing. Worried about litigation from publishers, the doctors did not reveal the names of magazines defined as 'gossipy'. Of the 19 'non-gossipy' magazines (four Time magazines and 15 of the Economist), none had disappeared. In order to cut costs, the researchers said serious magazines like Time and the Economist should be layed out, as they were not stolen . Gossip magazines disappeared nearly 15 times faster than non-gossipy ones, it was revealed. The researchers also noted current magazines were more likely to go missing than older ones, with 60 per cent of the magazines stolen less than two months old. The researchers worked out that if they extrapolate their findings to the 8,000 practices in Britain, each month £12.6 million disappears from general practices – assuming each magazine costs an average of £3.20. These are ‘resources that could be better used for healthcare,’ they said. They concluded that ‘practices should consider using old copies of the Economist and Time magazine as a first step towards saving costs.’ They said they hope their research might trigger the development of a ‘find my magazine’ app. Future research could also examine how receptionists cope in a waiting room without gossipy magazines, they added.","Doctors wanted to know why patients complained about old magazines .

"North Korean defectors are planning to attach DVDs of The Interview to 15-foot helium balloons, which they will send over the border into their home country. Fighters for a Free North Korea, led by former government propagandist Park Sang Hak, has for years used the tactic to smuggle transistor radios, DVDs and leaflets into North Korea. If all goes to plan, the latest move will see dozens of copies of the Seth Rogen movie released from South Korea and drifting for several hours before scattering over Pyongyang. North Korean defectors hold balloons carrying anti-North Korea leaflets at a park in the border town of Paju, north of Seoul. The helium balloons will be used to carry copies of The Interview into North Korea . Few people have access to any uncensored media in North Korea, but the regime is particularly opposed to The Interview as it involves a CIA plot to assassinate leader Kim Jong-un. The Human Rights Foundation in New York, founded by Thor Halvorssen, has been helping fund the balloon drops and said the next one is due in January. Halvorssen told The Hollywood Reporter that the past dozen or so drops have included copies of movies and TV shows like Braveheart, Battlestar Galactica and Desperate Housewives. Although The Interview will not be out on DVD at the start of next year, Halvorssen said copies of the comedy will be included in the drops as soon as it is. North Korean defectors, former soldiers, now living in South Korea and members of human rights foundations from the United States release balloons carrying propaganda leaflets . He added: 'Viewing any one of these is a subversive act that could get you executed, and North Koreans know this, given the public nature of the punishments meted out to those who dare watch entertainment from abroad,' Activists have for years used the tactic to smuggle transistor radios, DVDs and leaflets across the border and into North Korea . 'Despite all of that there is a huge thirst for knowledge and information from the outside world. 'North Koreans risk their lives to watch Hollywood films ... and The Interview is tremendously threatening to the Kims. 'They cannot abide by anything that portrays them as anything other than a god. This movie destroys the narrative.' The 15-foot long helium balloons are capable of reaching heights of around 16,000 feet and can drift for hundreds of miles, before timers tell them to release their loads. As well as DVDs and radios, they are also used to distribute any-regime propaganda, highlighting the severe human rights abuses and starvation suffered by the population, alongside the lavish lifestyle of the leadership. The Interview has been the center of controversy since hackers targeted Sony Pictures Entertainment, after North Korea denounced the movie, leading to speculation that the country could be behind the cyber attack. Over the summer, North Korea warned that the film's release would be an 'act of war that we will never tolerate'. It said the U.S. will face 'merciless' retaliation. Leaked versions of the pivotal scene show the dictator's head exploding after a missile hits his helicopter and engulfs him in flames. Anger over the depiction of the brutal assassination caused a hacking cell called Guardian of Peace to launch a cyber-attack on Sony Pictures, leaking thousands of damaging documents. The group also threatened terrorist attacks on the United States.

"A woman who tortured her teenage brother to death after accusing him  of witchcraft was jailed for life yesterday. Magalie Bamu and her boyfriend Eric Bikubi inflicted more than 130 injuries on  15-year-old Kristy Bamu over the course of a horrific four-day attack. Bamu, 29, a former Marks & Spencer worker, was told she will spend at least 25 years behind bars for the barbaric killing. Her boyfriend, 28, a former football coach, was jailed for at least 30 years after a jury heard that he had caused the teenager the most suffering. Jailed: Eric Bikubi, left, and his partner Magalie Bamu, right, were both jailed for life today for the horrific torture of Magalie's brother Kristy, which led to his death . Victim: 15-year-old Kristy Bamu, pictured left with a friend, suffered 130 injuries after being hit with an arsenal of weapons including broken ceramic floor tiles . Sentencing the Congolese pair at the . Old Bailey, Judge David Paget QC said Bamu must have realised her . sibling was going to die in an attack that ‘surpassed belief’. He added: ‘I am aware of the . controversy of the meaning of the word sadistic in this context. I am in . no doubt this murder involved a sadistic element. The intention was to . rid Kristy Bamu of witchcraft. ‘To do that both of you brutalised and physically abused him until eventually he died. It was prolonged torture. ‘A belief in witchcraft, however genuine, can never excuse an assault on another person or the killing of another human being. ‘I find it impossible not to  conclude . that there was an  intention by you, Eric Bikubi, to kill, perhaps not . at first but certainly at the end of the ordeal inflicted on Kristy. In court: Kelly Bamu, pictured on the witness stand, said Kristy asked for forgiveness. 'He asked again and again,' she said, adding 'Magalie did absolutely nothing. She didn't give a damn' ‘You, Magalie Bamu, must have realised . that might happen, why else say to your mother: “If you do not collect . the children, Eric would kill Kristy”.’ After the convictions, Kristy’s father . Pierre said: ‘Kristy was a delightful child with a promising future – . we will miss him terribly. ‘The fact Kristy died at the hands of . those who were expected to look after him and his siblings during their . visit to London, makes it all the more difficult for us to come to terms . with.’ Detective Superintendent Terry Sharpe, . of the Metropolitan Police, warned that crimes linked with  witchcraft . remained ‘hidden and under-reported’. WARNING: Graphic images below . Violent evidence: Kristy Bamu suffered 130 injuries after being tortured for four days with weapons including broken ceramic floor tiles . Witchcraft: These weapons were found at the scene in what officers called an 'unprecedented scenario' Evidence: Officers found a whole array of weapons in the flat, including pliers, a pole, and a piece of wood . Terrible death: Kristy's last words were 'I just want to die now' before he slipped underneath the water in the bath . He added: ‘It is difficult to see how . the verdicts will bring much comfort to the Bamu family but I do hope . that it will allow them to move on with their lives.’ The court previously heard that Bamu and Bikubi, like many Congolese nationals, were obsessed with kindoki, or witchcraft. The couple accused Kristy of trying to . bewitch a child in the family  after he arrived from Paris for . Christmas 2010 with four of his siblings at their council flat in . Newham, East London. The pair beat him with a metal . weightlifting pole, a curtain rod and a wooden plank, knocked out his . teeth with a hammer and smashed heavy floor tiles over his head. Meanwhile his siblings, aged between . 11 and 22, were forced to fast and pray throughout the night and at some . points goaded to join in and clear up the pools of blood. Kristy drowned in the bath on Christmas Day after begging to die as Bikubi hosed him down to ‘cleanse’ him of evil spirits. The sentences mark the end of a court . case that has sparked calls for police to do more to tackle crimes . fuelled by such medieval beliefs. There have been at least 83 cases of children attacked in London for ‘sorcery’ over the past decade. Shocking: This was the squalid and bloodstained scene police were confronted by when they discovered the killing of Kristy Bamu by his sister and her partner in Newham, east London . Scene of the crime: Kristy was forced to pray for deliverance for four days and deprived of food and water . Christian fundamentalist pastors in Britain are fuelling the belief in witchcraft, experts have warned. Dr Richard Hoskins, a police adviser, said he has spoken to many immigrant Londoners gripped by the potential power of malicious ‘spirits’ threatening to damage their families. Traditional methods of exorcism include wearing a charm, fasting or sacrificing an animal and are controlled by the Church. The university lecturer warned that Christian extremists and evangelists have begun taking advantage of vulnerable families and perpetuating beliefs in witchcraft by offering expensive ‘deliverance services’. Dr Hoskins said: ‘What seems to happen is that there is this dislocation and, in this case, something feral and wild. It is completely out of control.’ The issue was first highlighted by the case of eight-year-old Victoria Climbie in 2000. Victoria, who travelled to Britain from the Ivory Coast, died at the hands of her aunt and her boyfriend after being branded a witch. A year later the torso of a Nigerian boy, named Adam by police, was found in the Thames after he was ritually sacrificed. Police believe he may have been killed by someone with a terminal illness who believed his murder would save them. In 2005, three people were convicted of beating, cutting and rubbing chilli peppers in the eyes of an eight-year-old Angolan girl to ‘beat the devil out of her’.

"An Argentine zoo where tourists pose for photos inside lion cages could be shut down amid claims the animals appear drugged. Visitors to Lujan Zoo in Buenos Aires boasted of having an up-and-close experience for just £25 - but outraged animal activists handed their social media photos to the government. Now widespread reports suggest the zoo could be sanctioned or even shut down because the Argentine capital's laws prevent direct contact between people and wild animals. Scroll down for video . Crackdown: Lujan Zoo in Buenos Aires, where tourists can take the ultimate photos inside lion cages (including those pictured in this article) could be shut down by authorities concerned at the practice . Tame: The zoo says its animals are domesticated, taught calmness techniques and fed before visitors arrive, but critics were doubtful - and said many of the animals appeared to be drugged or sedated during visits . Leonardo Mascitelli, an undersecretary at Buenos Aires' Directorate of Wildlife of the Ministry of Land Affairs, confirmed the zoo was being investigated. He said the contact was against Article 8 of a provincial law which bans 'direct animal contact with the public' in parks and estates where animals are exhibited. His officials were sent social media photos by animal rights activists so sent inspectors - who were able to join the queues of dozens of tourists waiting to touch the animals. Mr Mascitelli added that he had asked for the 'maximum penalty' which could mean 'economic sanctions or closure'. The zoo has around 400 animals and is said to offer a 'unique interacting experience' in which visitors can pet, stroke, cuddle and even sit on lions, tigers and brown bears. It insists the animals are raised with domestic animals such as dogs and a keeper is always on hand in case anything goes wrong. Memento: One photo posted on social media shows a tourist pretending to attack the vacant-looking lion . One reviewer from New York wrote: 'To have been able to pet a white tiger was a dream come true for me' It adds that the animals are fed prior to interacting with visitors 'so they won't feel hungry when a human is inside their cage'. Zoo spokesman Neyen Rivero Longoria said: 'The animals are no more dangerous than domestic dogs because we have taught them the boundaries. 'We are the only zoo in the world that practices special training in gentleness techniques.' But animal rights groups and some tourists rubbished the claims, including on the travel review site Tripadvisor. One anonymous reviewer wrote: 'There was one lion unconscious lion passed out on a picnic table. When someone arrived for a photo, water was thrown on the clearly drugged lion's face and meat was dangled in front of it.' Another wrote: 'Since I got there and saw the poor animals, I realised something was happening in there. It seems like these animals are drugged or sedated... It's just a matter of time until someone gets hurt, and who will be the one to blame?' Hug: A Facebook group by activists calling for the zoo to be shut down has more than 6,000 members . Another, from Kansas, wrote: 'It was an amazing experience that I went into a bit naive. The animals are clearly drugged, especially the lions. 'However, they are taken care of and it was still terrifying to get to get in the cages with them to pet or feed them. You should just know what you are getting into. 'I definitely would have thought twice about going if I had realised the animals were going to be doped up.' And a Buenos Aires native wrote: 'This zoo is inhumane and made my stomach turn the entire time I was there. Yes, you can get close enough to pet a tiger or ride a lion but the animals are obviously sedated and if you have ever seen these beautiful creatures in the wild it is obvious.' A Facebook group called 'Close Lujan Zoo' now has more than 6,000 members. Its founders wrote: 'We are against animal mistreatment and consider Lujan Zoo to be one of the worst zoos in Argentina. 'Many of the animals are sedated for the selfish enjoyment of people without conscience. Close Lujan Zoo!' Controversy: Not everyone hated the zoo - and the vast majority of reviews on Tripadvisor were positive . Another visitor to the zoo boasted that a full experience cost only £25 including tips to staff inside the cage . Yet not everyone is against the zoo. One visitor who reviewed on Tripadvisor said she was thrilled that the whole experience only cost £25 including tips. And of the 1,800 Tripadvisors reviewers, only 130 said it was 'poor' or 'terrible', with more than half (960) saying their experience was 'excellent'. One reviewer from New York wrote: 'To have been able to pet a white tiger was a dream come true for me. I've loved them since I saw the tiger on the cover of my science book in high school. That experience definitely made up for the negative things we encountered at that zoo.' Another from Arizona added: 'I would say it's not likely the animals are being sedated, but rather that they're well-fed and raised with dogs.'","Lujan Zoo says lions have 'special training in gentleness techniques'

"The five largest theater chains in North America have announced that they are pulling The Interview from their schedules after hackers threatened 9/11-like terror attacks on cinemas showing the Sony Pictures film. Combined - Regal, AMC, Cinemark, Cineplex and Carmike - operate more than half of the country's 40,000 cinemas. In a statement, Regal said it was delaying any showings of The Interview because of 'the ambiguous nature of any real or perceived security threats.' Scroll down for video . The five largest theater chains in North America have announced they are pulling The Interview from their schedules after hackers threatened 9/11-like terror attacks on cinemas showing the Sony Pictures film . The Interview stars Seth Rogen and James Franco star as television journalists involved in a CIA plot to assassinate North Korean leader Kim Jong Un . The statement from Regal's vice president of marketing and communications also pointed the finger of blame at Sony and its 'wavering support' for the movie. Sony did not immediately comment on the news on Wednesday. On Tuesday, the studio told exhibitors that the company understood if they pulled the film in light of the threats. 'Due to the wavering support of the film The Interview by Sony Pictures, as well as the ambiguous nature of any real or perceived security threats, Regal Entertainment Group has decided to delay the opening of the film in our theaters,' said Regal's Russ Nunley. Regal Entertainment is the country's largest operator with more than 7,000 cinemas. Cineplex also has more than a 75 percent market share in Canada with 161 theaters with 1,639 screens. 'Cineplex takes seriously its commitment to the freedom of artistic expression, but we want to reassure our guests and staff that their safety and security is our No. 1 priority,' said a Cineplex spokesperson on Wednesday. Carmike Cinemas, which operates 247 theaters across the country, was the first to cancel its planned showings of the film on Tuesday. The fallout from the Sony Pictures Entertainment hack that began four weeks ago exploded on Tuesday after the shadowy group calling themselves Guardians of Peace escalated their attack beyond corporate espionage and threatened moviegoers with violence reminiscent of the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. Extra precaution: James Franco was spotted in NYC on Tuesday night with his new giant bodyguard after GOP issued a chilling new threat warning of 9/11-style attacks on movie theaters that show The Interview . A NYPD vehicle outside the Sunshine Cinema in New York. It was supposed to be showing the New York premiere of The Interview on Thursday, but the event has been canceled . The Department of Homeland Security has said there was 'no credible intelligence to indicate an active plot against movie theaters,' but noted it was still analyzing messages from the group, dubbed GOP. The theaters won’t play the film until the conclusion of an FBI investigation into the three-week-old cyberattack on Sony Pictures and subsequent terrorist threats, reports The Wall Street Journal. The warning did prompt law enforcement in New York and Los Angeles to address measures to ramp up security and Thursday's New York premiere at the Landmark Sunshine was canceled as a result. Sony still plans to make the film available to theaters on Christmas Day should they choose to exhibit it, although the company is now understood to be considering releasing the film on premium video-on-demand instead, reports Variety. The move would allow the studio to recoup some of the film’s $42 million budget and maximize the promotional exposure the film has received due to the threats. It would also enable the studio to experiment with the potential of VOD. In The Interview, Rogen and Franco star as television journalists involved in a CIA plot to assassinate North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. Speculation about a North Korean link to the Sony hacking has centered on that country's angry denunciation of the film. Trouble: Hacking group Guardians of Peace have said a terrorist attack could befall any theaters showing The Interview, which stars James Franco and Seth Rogen (above) Over the summer, North Korea warned that the film's release would be an 'act of war that we will never tolerate.' It said the U.S. will face 'merciless' retaliation. The film was slated to hit theaters nationwide on Christmas Day. It premiered in Los Angeles last week. But on Tuesday, Rogen and Franco pulled out of all media appearances, canceling a Buzzfeed Q&A and Rogen's planned guest spot Thursday on Late Night With Seth Meyers. The FBI said it is aware of the GOP's threats and 'continues to work collaboratively with our partners to investigate this matter.' FBI director James Comey last week said that investigators are still trying to determine who is responsible for the hack. Los Angeles Police Chief Charlie Beck said his department takes the hackers' threats 'very seriously' and will be taking extra precautions during the holidays at theaters. Security is seen outside the Theatre at Ace Hotel before the premiere of the film 'The Interview'  in Los Angeles, California on December 11, 2014 . Hollywood studio Sony Pictures said on Tuesday that it was not pulling the film, but is leaving it to theater chains to decide whether to show the movie, which depicts a fictional plot to assassinate North Korean dictator Kim Jong-Un. 'We plan to release the film,' said a source at Sony, which is dealing with fallout from an enormous cyber-attack last month. The source added that a decision whether to show the film 'is with theater owners, partners whom we support.' GOP also released a trove of data files including 32,000 emails to and from Sony Entertainment CEO Michael Lynton in what it called the beginning of a 'Christmas gift.' And two former Sony film production workers filed lawsuits alleging the Culver City, California company waited too long to notify nearly 50,000 employees that data such as Social Security numbers, salaries and medical records had been stolen. The filing follows another lawsuit this week from two other former Sony employees accusing the studio of being negligent by not bolstering its defenses against hackers before the attack. The Guardians of Peace threat released on Tuesday reads: . Warning . We will clearly show it to you at the very time and places The Interview be shown, including the premiere, how bitter fate those who seek fun in terror should be doomed to. Soon all the world will see what an awful movie Sony Pictures Entertainment has made. The world will be full of fear. Remember the 11th of September 2001. We recommend you to keep yourself distant from the places at that time. (If your house is nearby, you’d better leave.) Whatever comes in the coming days is called by the greed of Sony Pictures Entertainment. All the world will denounce the SONY. It claims emails and other leaked information show that Sony's information-technology department and its top lawyer believed its security system was vulnerable to attack, but that company did not act on those warnings. Sony potentially faces tens of millions of dollars in damages from a class-action lawsuit, said Jonathan Handel, an entertainment law professor at the University of Southern California Gould School of Law. Since the hack surfaced late last month, everything from financial figures to salacious emails between top Sony executives has been dumped online. The nearly 32,000 emails to and from Sony Pictures Entertainment CEO Lynton leaked on Tuesday include information about casting decisions and total costs for upcoming films, release schedules for Sony films through 2018 and corporate financial records, such as royalties from iTunes, Spotify and Pandora music services. They include information about new electronics devices such as DVD players and cellphones. They also include budget figures for the Motion Picture Association of America, of which Sony is a member, and at least one email about a senior Sony executive who left the company. Hackers invoked the 9/11 attacks in their most chilling threat yet against Sony Pictures, warning the Hollywood studio not to release a film which has angered North Korea . The emails also include banal messages about public appearances, tennis matches, home repairs, dinner invitations and business introductions. On Monday, Sony Pictures boss Michael Lynton sought to reassure employees that the studio would not be destroyed by the leaks. 'This will not take us down,' Lynton told employees, adding: 'You should not be worried about the future of this studio.' North Korea has denied involvement in the brazen November 24 cyber-attack, which some expert said could possibly have been carried out by disgruntled workers or by supporters of North Korea furious over the movie.","Cinema chains are pulling The Interview from their schedules after hackers threatened 9/11-like terror attacks on theaters showing the movie .

"A cemetery containing more than a million mummified human bodies has been unearthed in central Egypt, according to archaeologists. Scientists have already excavated more than 1,700 mummies, preserved by the hot dry desert in the Faiyum region of Egypt about 60 miles (96km) south of Cairo. But those leading the work believe their could be up to a million similar bodies buried in shafts cut into the limestone rock that are at times up to 75ft (22.9 metres) deep. Scroll down for video . A mummified 18 month old girl with bracelets still on both arms was recently found at the Fag el-Gamous site . It is thought that the mummies were buried around 1,500 years ago, between the 1st and 7th Century AD, when Egypt was controlled by the Roman and Byzantine Empire. Unlike many famous mummified remains discovered in Egypt, these were found in mass graves and appear to be ordinary citizens rather than royalty or other important figures.

Yet scientists are baffled about where the huge numbers of mummies came from - the remains of a nearby village is too small to warrant such a large cemetery and the nearest town, named Philadelphia after King Ptolemy II Phiadelphus, has its own burial sites. Archaeologists have also uncovered a bizarre range of mummies, including one man who is more than seven feet (213 cm) tall. They have also discovered that the mummies appear to be clustered together by hair colour, with those with blond hair in one area and all of those with red hair in another. Professor Kerry Muhlestein, project director of the excavation at Brigham Young University, in Utah, said: 'The cemetery is densely populated. 'In a square that is 5 x 5 meters across and usually just over 2 meters deep, we will typically find about 40 burials. 'The cemetery is very large, and so far seems to maintain that kind of burial density throughout. 'Thus the maths suggests that there are over a million mummies in the cemetery, though we cannot be certain of this without further exploration and a thorough academic review process.' Although the Fag el-Gamous necropolis, which is named after a nearby road that translates as 'Way of the Buffalo', was first discovered nearly 30 years ago, archaeologists are still trying to piece together what they have found there. Annual excavations at the site, on the eastern edge of the Faiyum region, near the city of Silah, regularly unearth  mummified remains and Professor Muhlestein presented the latest discoveries at the Scholars Colloquim at the Society for the Study of Egyptian Antiquities last month. Among the recent discoveries made last year were the mummified remains of a little girl aged around 18 months old, still with two bracelets on each arm. Unlike royal Egyptian mummies, the people buried at Fag el-Gamous had few goods buried with them and were laid in the ground without coffins. Their internal organs were also rarely removed, an important part of the mummification process, so it is the arid environment of the desert that is largely thought to have preserved the bodies. However, with the latest discovery of the little girl, Professor Muhlestein said there appears to have also been some attempt by those who buried her to use the full mummification process. Writing on the team's Facebook page, which Professor Muhlestein only recently updated in an attempt to keep the discoveries secret, said: 'This mummy was beautifully wrapped in a tunic and with other nice wrappings. Many bodies were found in clusters, like these wrapped remains of two children and two adults . Bodies tended to be clustered by hair colour, like this one with long blonde hair that is thought to be female . 'There was some evidence that they tried much of the full mummification process. The toes and toenails and brain and tongue were amazingly preserved. 'We found a wonderful necklace and two bracelets on each arm. The jewellery makes us think it was a girl, but we cannot tell. 'She was buried with great care as someone who obviously loved her very much did all they could to take care of this little girl in burial. Very sad. 'But they succeeded, it was a beautiful burial. She had been buried with several other mummies, so we are interested in examining them.' Another woman, with long blonde hair, was found buried among a group of other bodies that all had healthy sets of teeth. Professor Muhlestein said: 'Quite a few of our mummies had excellent teeth, something that is unusual. Scientists have already excavated more than 1,700 mummies, preserved by the hot dry desert in the Faiyum region of Egypt about 60 miles (96km) south of Cairo. They believe there are around a million to be found . The mummies were found in deep shafts hacked into the limestone bedrock beneath the surface of the desert . More than 1,700 bodies have been recovered from the 300 acre site since it was discovered 30 years ago . 'One wonders if it is genetics that caused a group that may be related to each other to have better teeth than the norm. 'Of course we don't know that they are related just because they are buried near each other, but throughout the history of the world it is common for families to be buried near each other. 'It seems likely, but we cannot assume.' He added: 'The cemetery is largely a Roman period cemetery, located in the Fayoum area of Egypt. 'The burials are not in tombs, but rather in a field of sand. The people in the cemetery represent the common man. 'They are the average people who are usually hard to learn about because they are not very visible in written sources. 'They were poor, yet they put a tremendous amount of their resources into providing beautiful burials.' With the cemetery stretching over 300 acres, Professor Muhlestein believes there are many more secrets to be uncovered in its burial shafts. A small pyramid built nearby to the cemetery more than 4,500 years ago - two millennia before the cemetery was first used - may also hold some more clues as to what these people were doing here. 'It's hard to know where all these people were coming from,' Professor Muhlestein told Live Science. Many of the best preserved bodies have been wrapped in linen or reeds, which together with the dry desert climate has helped to mummify the remains, although some bodies had also had their organs removed . Researchers conduct annual excavations at the site but believe there could be a million bodies buried there . While some of the discoveries at Fag el-Gamous show a surprising degree of good health, such as having full sets of teeth, mummies from ancient Egypt have shown that Ancient Egyptians had quite unhealthy lifestyles. Scans of 4,000-year-old mummies have revealed evidence of hardening of the arteries – a condition which can lead to heart attacks and strokes. Earlier studies had revealed fatty arteries in a large number of Egyptian mummies but critics had dismissed the find as related to their luxurious, fatty diets. Much of the discoveries have yet to be properly published as the archaeologists have been reluctant to reveal the exact location of the cementery. Professor Muhlestein described how one mummy was found folded in half in order to fit him into the burial shaft. He believes that the man, who was over 7ft tall (213cm) may have suffered from a medical condition caused by an excess of growth hormone, but said more research needs to be done to prove this. He also believes that some of the clusters by hair colour may actually be due to people being buried in family groups and so are related. He hopes that genetic testing may be possible to help show how some of the mummies were related to each other. Together with the bodies, archaeologists have also discovered glass beads, linen, jewelry and even colourful children's boots. 'A lot of their wealth, as little as they had, was poured into these burials,' said Professor Muhlestein. This skeleton was found entombed inside an unusual triangle shaped vault at the bottom of a burial shaft .","The Fag el-Gamous cemetery stretches over 300 acres in Faiyum, Egypt .

"The State Department reviewed the graphic death scene of North Korean leader Kim Jong-un in 'The Interview' and approved of it, according to newly-released hacked emails from Sony. The shocking report comes as five movie theater chains across the country pulled the film following threats from hackers to attack cinemas that air the film. The Landmark Sunshine Cinema canceled its New York premier of 'The Interviews' and also stepped up security over the threats. The Daily Beast reports that emails from Sony Pictures CEO Michael Lynton reveal that two US government officials screened an early version of the film - including the controversial scene in which Kim Jong-un's head explodes in a fireball - and gave it their blessing. Scroll down for video . Worldwide sensation: The brouhaha surrounding 'The Interview' comes down to one scene in which Kim Jong-un's head explodes in gruesome fashion . Sony CEO Michael Lynton is the latest victim of the hacking attack, which is believed to come from . Sony executives became concerned about 'The Interview,' a comedy starring Seth Rogen and James Franco, is June after North Korea called the film 'an act of war.' They hired an expert on North Korea from the Rand Corporation, who consulted with the State Departments special envoy for North Korean human rights issues, according to the Daily Beast. Ambassador Robert King, one of three top diplomats in charge of North Korean matters, concluded that the threats from the hermit nation were not terribly worrying, the Daily Beast reports. Additionally, the hacked emails reveal, Lynton spoke to a 'very senior' State Department official, who gave the green light to the controversial ending of the film, according to the news site. Sony has found itself at the center of an international incident over the film. North Korea hackers - or a group sympathetic to North Korea - are believed to be behind the cyber attack on Sony Pictures that has released millions of sensitive documents - including the emails of top executives. Lynton's emails were released online by the group on Tuesday. Producer, director and star Seth Rogen (right) toned down the death scene after pressure by Sony executives. It is believed angry North Korean hackers are behind the massive Sony data leak . Ambassador Robert King, special envoy for North Korea, reportedly weighed in on the film . Bruce Bennett, a senior defense analyst at the RAND Corporation, was hired by Sony to review the film and offer his expertise on how much it might inflame North Korean ire. He wrote in an email to Sony executives: 'I have been clear that the assassination of Kim Jong-Un is the most likely path to a collapse of the North Korean government. 'Thus while toning down the ending may reduce the North Korean response, I believe that a story that talks about the removal of the Kim family regime and the creation of a new government by the North Korean people (well, at least the elites) will start some real thinking in South Korea and, I believe, in the North once the DVD leaks into the North (which it almost certainly will). So from a personal perspective, I would personally prefer to leave the ending alone.' Lynton, according to the Daily Beast, replied: 'Spoke to someone very senior in State (confidentially). He agreed with everything you have been saying. Everything. I will fill you in when we speak.' Mr Bennett added: Michael, I talked with Amb. King a few minutes ago. Their office has apparently decided that this is typical North Korean bullying, likely without follow-up, but you never know with North Korea. Thus, he did not appear worried and clearly wanted to leave any decisions up to Sony.' Sony ended up pressuring Rogen, the director, producer and star of the film, to tone down the final death scene - removing some of the most gruesome details from the moment Kim Jong-un is killed. Additionally, an edited version of the scene will be shown in most foreign markets. The movie is not slated to open in Asia at all.","Sony executives hired an foreign policy analyst to consult after North Korea called the film The Interview 'an act of war' for depicting the assassination of Kim Jon-un .

"A Manhattan investment banker has resigned from his $7-million-a-year job after his estranged wife made explosive allegations about cocaine binges and forced group sex during their messy, bitter divorce and custody battle over their two daughters. Sage Kelly, who ran the profitable healthcare banking business for Jefferies Group, is stepping down to 'focus on his family,' Bloomberg reports. The sensational public claims by his estranged wife Christina Kelly led Jefferies Group to drug test the entire healthcare banking department. Bitter divorce: Sage Kelly has stepped down from his job - where he reportedly made $7million a year - after the shocking by his estranged wife Christina . The company even made reference to the scandal when releasing its quarterly earnings report on Tuesday - noting that 'unusual publicity' hadn't hurt business, according to Bloomberg. Mr Kelly, 42, has been on leave from the company since October when Mrs Kelly made shocking allegations in court documents that he coerced her to have sex with a prospective client after a night of heavy drinking and snorting cocaine. The raucous account of the night - which has been denied by Mr Kelly, as well as the other executive Mrs Kelly named - includes a drug-addled foursome in which the other executive's girlfriend showed off her new breast implants. The night ended with the Kellys partner swapping with the other executive and Mrs Kelly having sex with the prospective client, she claimed in her lawsuit. Mrs Kelly claims she felt coerced into having sex with the other executive that night - and played the dutiful wife in the hopes that it would win her husband a big client. Mr and Mrs Kelly agreed last month to share custody of their two daughter and settled the divorce for a massive sum . Mrs Kelly eventually sent out a statement praising her husband as a 'great father' and apologizing for the allegations she made . Mr Kelly had won full custody of the couple's two daughters after he showed a judge hidden camera footage of his wife doing cocaine and argued that she was an unfit parent. He also cited her 2010 crash and drunk driving arrest in the Hamptons in which one of the couple's daughters was in the back seat. That prompted Mrs Kelly, 39, fired back with a series of shocking charges against her husband. In addition to the alleged group sex, Mrs Kelly claimed that her husband had drug parties with major players from the New York banking world. She alleges he binged on drugs including: Molly, ketamine, magic mushrooms, ecstasy and heroin. Mr Kelly denied all allegations his wife made in the divorce proceedings. The two settled in November - a month after Mrs Kelly filed the explosive divorce claims - for a massive sum and agreed to split custody of .","Sage Kelly stepped down from Jefferies Group following showing allegations of drug abuse by estranged wife Christina Kelly .

"Defensive lineman Ray McDonald has been released from the San Francisco 49ers, the team said Wednesday afternoon. The news came after San Jose police said Wednesday that they are investigating McDonald on suspicion of sexual assault. 49ers general manager Trent Baalke said in a statement on the team's website 'We as an organization have notified [McDonald] and his agent that he will be terminated, released immediately. 'While this organization has a strong belief in due process and has demonstrated that over time, Ray has demonstrated a pattern of poor decision-making that has led to multiple distractions for this organization and this football team that can no longer be tolerated.' Baalke said he informed McDonald and his agent by phone at 11:30 a.m. PST that the defender is 'terminated.' 'This is a situation that we can all learn from,' Baalke said. He also stated that both CEO Jed York and coach Jim Harbaugh were involved in the decision. 'We expect a lot from our players, hold them accountable for their actions,' Baalke said. Scroll down for video . Investigation: San Jose Police Department Sgt. Heather Randol said detectives searched McDonald's San Jose home . Baalke said the 49ers notified the NFL office of the allegations against McDonald, saying, 'This is a team decision.' Detectives have searched McDonald's San Jose home, San Jose Police Department Sgt. Heather Randol said. Randol said an area hospital notified police late Tuesday night that a woman was seeking treatment. 'The victim alleged she was possibly sexually assaulted a day prior,' Randol said. 'Based on preliminary investigation, detectives secured a search warrant and served it at the alleged suspect's residence in San Jose.' Randol didn't immediately respond to follow up questions seeking to clarify the reference to the alleged victim saying she was 'possibly sexually assaulted.' No arrests have been made or charges filed. McDonald's mother, Labrina McDonald, told The San Jose Mercury News the allegation was 'laughable' and not true. She said her son warned her not to talk to the media, but she told the paper that 'There's no truth to that stuff.' NFL spokesman Greg Aiello said the league is 'looking into' the case. Stopped: Last month, the Santa Clara County district attorney's office announced that it declined to file charges against McDonald in a domestic violence investigation stemming from his August 31 arrest . NBC Bay Area's Damian Trujillo, citing sources, reported Wednesday afternoon that the alleged victim is not the fiancee of McDonald. 'It's very unfortunate. [...] I understand why the team did what it did. Outside of that, not my business,' 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick told The San Jose Mercury News. 'He's a good friend to lot people on team. No one ever thought bad of him. Hopefully it's just a misunderstanding.' This is the second time in recent months that McDonald has been the subject of a police investigation. Last month, the Santa Clara County district attorney's office announced that it declined to file charges against the defensive lineman in a domestic violence investigation stemming from his August 31 arrest. Prosecutors cited conflicting versions of what happened, a lack of verifiable eyewitnesses and a lack of cooperation by the alleged victim, McDonald's fiancee. 'This is about a pattern of poor decision making,' Baalke said. Harbaugh notified the players. McDonald said in November that he and his fiancee remain together and are working to strengthen their relationship. 'We love each other,' McDonald said at the time.","Defensive lineman Ray McDonald has been released from the San Francisco 49ers, the team said Wednesday afternoon .

"Jordan Axani may be single, but he won't be spending Christmas alone. The 27-year-old Canadian started an online campaign last month to find someone to take his ex-girlfriend's place on a round-the-world trip they planned back in March. The couple's subsequent break-up left him with multiple non-transferable tickets in his ex's name, so he set out to find another Canadian called Elizabeth Gallagher to give the tickets to for free. And the search was a success. A 23-year-old student and part-time office administrator named Elizabeth Quinn Gallagher, from Nova Scotia, took Axani up on his offer, despite her long-term boyfriend's less than enthusiastic attitude. Scroll down for video . Travel companions: Jordan Axani (left) started an online campaign last month to find someone with the same name as his ex-girlfriend to travel with him on a round-the-world Christmas vacation, since he couldn't transfer the tickets. Nova Scotia student Elizabeth Quinn Gallagher, 23 (right), agreed to join the stranger on the trip . Just friends: However, the trip will be completely platonic since Gallagher already has a boyfriend, who is apparently not so pleased to see her leave on a vacation with another man. Pictured above with a man who appears to be her boyfriend on Facebook . Pick me, pick me! Gallagher tweeted this picture of her Canadian passport when she heard Axani was looking for someone to join him on his epic vacation from New York to New Dehli . 'He understands that I've always wanted to travel so while he's not happy I'm taking off for nearly a month at Christmas with a random guy he's smiling through it,' Gallagher said of her boyfriend, who she plans to purchase a home with. Gallagher says she initially thought the trip was 'crazy' but was put at ease after spending hours talking to Axani over the phone. 'It definitely did seem a little bit creepy at the beginning but now that I talked to him it's less creepy and more awesome,' she said. Axani says the trip will be 'strictly platonic' and he's looking forward to jetting out of New York on December 21. The original Elizabeth Gallagher: Axani (left) originally planned to spend this Christmas holiday travelling around the world with former girlfriend Elizabeth Gallagher (left). She broke up with him after they bought all of the plane tickets . Axani and Gallagher will then travel to Milan, Prague, Paris, Bangkok, and New Dehli before returning to Toronto on January 8. Because Axani stopped planning the trip when he broke up with his girlfriend, he didn't book any hotels for the trip. However, after the story went viral online, Marriott International stepped up to provide Axani and his companion with separate rooms at each stop on their journey. Axani plans to document the once-in-a-lifetime trip with a stranger online. The experience also opened him up to the realization of how lucky he is to be going on such a trip. Of the thousands of emails he received in his search, he got one especially touching message from an 8-year-old boy who was going blind and wanted to see the world before losing his vision. That message inspired Axani, who works in international real estate, to start an organization with his brother called A Ticket Forward to help people who want to travel but don't have the money. Axani initially started his search on Reddit last month, posting a plea that said: 'I need your help. You see, in March I booked a fairly wicked trip around the world for this Christmas for my ex and I. Desperate: In November, Axani posted this message to Reddit in an attempt to find another Elizabeth Gallagher willing to join him on the trip . 'While our relationship has come to a close, I am still planning on going on the trip and she is not (naturally). 'And because I hate the idea of a ticket around the world going to waste, I am looking for a Canadian named Elizabeth Gallagher who could use the ticket. 'Anyone familiar with with the archaic system that is modern air travel will know that a name change on a ticket is damn near impossible. 'Moreover, the flights were purchased during a massive blow-up on Priceline and were frankly so cheap and on so many different airlines that they're not worth the headache or money to cancel.' Before potential candidates started applying to accompany him, he laid some ground rules, but also offered to buy the first glass of wine before jetting off. Giving: The campaign opened up Axani to how lucky he was to be taking such a vacation, and he has since launched a charity to help other people travel who can't afford it . He wrote: 'I am not looking for anything in return. I am not looking for companionship, romance, drugs, a trade, or to take selfies with you in front the Christmas Market in Prague. 'If you feel compelled to toss me a couple hundred bucks, great. Really the only thing I ask for is that you enjoy this trip and that it bring you happiness. 'We can travel together and see some cool stuff - or not. I'm easy and have no problem with someone taking the tickets and doing their own thing (see ya on the plane!). 'Embracing the spontaneity of life is more my thing, though, so if you want to travel together (and are not an axe murder) I’m likely game. 'This is for the flights only. In the wake of the breakup I have deferred all further planning for the trip. No hotels, trains or anything have been booked. You're on your own, bucko.

"If he had lived, George Stinney Jr would be 84 today. Perhaps, enjoying the golden years of his life with a wife, children and grandchildren. Instead, the black boy was just 14 and under 100 pounds when he was propped up on an electric chair with a phone book and executed for a pair of murders he probably didn't commit in 1944. On Wednesday, seventy years too late, a South Carolina judge threw out Stinney's conviction on the basis that he had been wronged by the justice system, which pushed to arrest, convict and execute him in just a three-month period. The ruling gave relief to Stinney's brother, sisters and civil rights activists who have been fighting to get his case reviewed for years. Stolen life: George Stinney Jr (pictured) became the  youngest person executed in the 20th century when he was electrocuted in 1944 for the deaths of two girls in Acolu, South Carolina. A judge on Wednesday overturned the ruling on the basis that Stinney's civil rights had been violated by the justice system . Admission: Stinney confessed to killing 11-year-old Betty June Binnicker (pictured) and 7-year-old Mary Emma Thames, after the 14-year-old was separated from his parents and interrogated by police. Judge Carmen Mullins says it's likely the confession was coerced . Stinney was living with his family in the segregated mill town of Acolu, South Carolina when he was arrested in connection to the murders of two white girls, 11-year-old Betty June Binnicker and 7-year-old Mary Emma Thames. The girls disappeared on March 23, 1944 when they went for a bike ride together in search of wildflowers. The girls' bodies were found the next morning in a shallow ditch behind a church, butchered to death with a railroad spike, their skulls crushed in. Stinney was arrested after witnesses said they saw him picking flowers with the girls. He admitted to the crime after being separated from his parents and interrogated by police. After that, the justice system moved at lightening speed as he was tried in just one day and found guilty by an all-male, all-white jury who deliberated for less than 10 minutes. Stinney was denied appeal and just three months after the girls' bodies were found, he became the youngest person in the twentieth century to be executed. The 95-pound teen was so small he had to be propped up on a phone book on the electric chair, and one of the electrodes was too big for his leg. South Carolina Circuit Court Judge Carmen Mullins reviewed his case this year, and issued her ruling to overturn it on Wednesday. Mullins says she did judge the case based on the facts, since too many documents were lost, but on how the justice system treated the young boy. She says she had to overturn the ruling because Stinney was not properly defended by his attorney, the confession was likely coerced and there was a lack of witnesses or physical evidence. 'From time to time we are called to look back to examine our still-recent history and correct injustice where possible,' Mullins wrote. 'I can think of no greater injustice than a violation of one's constitutional rights, which has been proven to me in this case by a preponderance of the evidence standard.' Family grief: Some of Stinney's surviving family members were in the court room when the judgement was announced on Wednesday. On the left, Stinney's sisters Amie Ruffner (left) and Katherine Stinney-Robinson (right) in court last January . Mullins also pointed out the fact that the court never tried to get the case moved to another location, where the jury would not have had an emotional connection to the two girls who died. Finally, Mullins said that executing the boy for the crime, even though he was the minimum age for criminal responsibility in the state, constituted cruel and unusual punishment. Some of Stinney's surviving family members were in court on Wednesday to hear the monumental ruling. Stinney's two sisters and brother testified earlier this year in the course of the trial. In a 2009 affidavit, Stinney's sisters said that they spent the day with their brother when the girls went missing, making it impossible for him to have carried out the crime. Stinney is seen second from the right in this pictured published in a newspaper in 1944 , entering South Carolina's death house at a state prison in Columbia . 'They took my brother away and I never saw my mother laugh again,' Stinney's sister Amie Ruffner, 78, previously said. 'I would love his name to be cleared.' While the ruling is especially important for Stinney's family, it is also a major breakthrough for the African-American community at large, many of whom believe the U.S. justice system continues to hold a race bias. Ray Brown, who is producing a film called 83 Days based on the Stinney trial, says the decision makes a 'great statement' to the country as cities across the nation have recently been embroiled in protests over the police killings of black men Eric Garner and Michael Brown. Both were killed by white police officers, but grand juries in both New York and Missouri failed to indict the cops responsible. 'It’s never too late for justice,' Brown told The Grio. 'There’s no statute of limitations on justice. One of the things I can say about South Carolina and I can give them credit for — is that they got it right this time. During a period of time in our nation where we seem to have such a great racial divide, you have a southern state that has decided to admit they made a mistake and correct it.'","George Stinney Jr was found guilty in 1944 of killing two white girls, 7-year-old Mary Emma Thames and 11-year-old Betty June Binnicker .

"Johns Hopkins University has been left red-faced after mistakenly sending welcome messages to almost 300 applicants who had actually been denied. The emails sent Sunday afternoon with the subject line 'Embrace the YES!', urged recipients to visit the school store, start using the Twitter handle #JHU2019 and join a Facebook group exclusively for students. Officials at the prestigious private Baltimore college told The Washington Post it was a mistake of human error. At the click of a button: Johns Hopkins University has been left red-faced after mistakenly sending welcome messages to almost 300 applicants who had actually been denied . Senior admissions administrator, David Phillips, says a contractor who works on electronic communications pulled the wrong email list. Of the 294 applicants who received the incorrect message, 285 had actually been denied bids for early admissions and nine had received deferrals. 'We apologize to the students affected and to their families,' Phillips said. He continued: ''Admissions decision days are stressful enough. 'We very much regret having added to the disappointment felt by a group of very capable and hardworking students, especially ones who were so committed to the idea of attending Johns Hopkins that they applied early decision.' Cathy Stephenson of Culpeper County, Virginia, says she's irate that her son received a mistaken admission notice after an earlier denial. She says university officers should make personal calls to apologize and the mistake is 'inexcusable.' Phillips said  such calls were not made because it would only draw further attention to the problem. On their website, the university said it received a total of 1,865 applications for the class of 2019 and admitted 539 new students.","The emails sent on Sunday had the subject line 'Embrace the YES!'

"Anyone heading to the Vatican had better pray they have enough cash with them after a move to block credit card payments. The city-state can only take notes and coins for museum tickets and other services after Italy's central blanks stopped electronic payments. That is because Deutsche Bank Italia - which until now provided the service - has ruled that the Vatican does not fully comply with EU safeguards against money laundering. As a result Italian banks are not authorised to operate within the Vatican, which is trying to improve methods to battle laundering. Card rejected: Ben Kiniry, of Texas, gets cash from an ATM machine along Rome's Via della Conciliazione, the main road leading to the Vatican. Italy's central bank decided to block electronic payments, including credit cards, at the tiny city-state . The Vatican says it is 'scrambling' to solve the problem for thousands of visitors who flock to its very popular museums and attractions, such as the Sistine Chapel. Tourists in the long queues that snaked around the Vatican City walls today were not happy about the inconvenience. Italian Giuseppe Amoruso said: 'It's certainly a disadvantage. Credit cards provide a useful service, which needs to be accessible to everybody, everywhere.' American tourist Fluger William Hunter said: 'A lot of tourists don't have cash on them, so they have to get euros and don't know where to get them.' The central bank said a routine . inspection found that Deutsche Bank Italia had not sought authorisation . when it first started providing services at the Vatican. When . it finally did, the Bank of Italy turned it down because the Vatican's . banking norms, including measures to combat money laundering, did not . meet Italy's more stringent criteria. The . Vatican has been striving to upgrade its measures to detect and . discourage money laundering, hiring a Swiss expert just a few months . ago. Donation: The ban on credit cards is a major blow as the museums and other attractions of the Vatican are a major source of income for the tiny city-state . Crime prevention: The ban was implemented because the Vatican does not comply with EU safeguards against money laundering . The Vatican, home of Pope Benedict XVI, is desperately trying to improve security measures and get permission to accept electronic money transfers . Last summer, the Holy See passed a key European financial transparency test but received failing grades for its financial watchdog agency and its bank, formally called the Institute for Religious Works. The museums, with their entrance fees and popular souvenir shops, are a big money-maker for the Vatican. Other Vatican attractions, such as tours of the Vatican's ancient underground spaces, also charge admission.","Vatican falls foul of anti-money laundering safeguards .

"There's more to New Years Eve than Hogmanay and Jools Holland. Revellers around the globe will be celebrating in a number of weird and wonderful ways - many of which put party poppers and bubbly to shame. In Siberia and Russia, there is a tradition to dive into a frozen lake, while holding a tree trunk, which is placed under the ice. Meanwhile, in Romania farmers try to communicate with their animals on New Years Eve. If they are successful it is believed they will have good luck for the next year. Over in Burma people splash water on one another to start the new year with a more purified soul and in the Czech Republic, revellers cut an apple in half then inspect its shape to see what the next 356 days hold.

"Selling his clothes! Mr Bissinger is auctioning off about 150 of the designer pieces he acquired during a years-long battle with shopping addiction . Buzz Bissinger, the famed author of Friday Night Lights: A Town, a Team, and a Dream, is selling off the designer clothes he bought during a long struggle with shopping addiction. The 60-year-old writer - who has a penchant for leather jackets and Gucci - has enlisted the services of online retailer Luxeswap to put his high-end footwear, jackets, and pants on eBay. Mr Bissinger opened up about his addiction in an article for GQ in April 2013, in which he estimated he'd spent $587,412.97 on both women's and men's designer duds for himself from 2010 through 2012. He has since gone into rehab for the problem, as well as other issues, and calls his decision to sell his possessions an 'important moment' in the recovery process, reports Put This On. The Pulitzer Prize winner, who lives in Philadelphia and has a wife and three grown children, is letting go of more than 150 pieces (about three-quarters of what he owns) which will be sold little by little over the next few months. Each item will come a certificate of authenticity signed by the author himself, who says he has 'no shame about any of this.' Matthew, Luxeswap's founder, told MailOnline that a few of the standout pieces that will be on the auction block include a $20,000 pony-skin leather Loewe coat; some 'exceptional' Gucci motorcycle jackets; and a Gucci one-of-a-kind Persian lamb coat. 'It's the finest collection of leather I've ever seen,' he said. Mr Bissinger told Matthew he'd need to 'get a U-haul' when he went to pick up the clothing- as an SUV wouldn't be big enough. He's a rockstar! Mr Bissinger in one of the leather jackets he's selling on Luxeswap . What a stud! This Diane von Furstenberg jacket will be part of the sale - and is the same jacket Mr Bissinger is wearing in the picture above . In his revealing essay for GQ in 2013, Mr Bissinger revealed how shopping gave him a rush of sexual energy. He wrote: 'I own... seventy-five pairs of boots, forty-one pairs of leather pants, thirty-two pairs of haute couture jeans, ten evening jackets, and 115 pairs of leather gloves. 'I have an addiction. It isn't drugs or gambling: I get to keep what I use after I use it. 'But there are similarities: the futile feeding of the bottomless beast and the unavoidable psychological implications, the immediate hit of the new that feels like an orgasm and the inevitable coming-down.' Red-y or not! A stunning red leather jacket by Joseph will also be on the auction block . A head of the pack! This Phillip Plein jacket has a skull, fur, and fewer than 50 shades of grey leather . Mr Bissinger, who describes Gucci as his main 'compulsion,' said the most expensive leather jacket he owns cost $13,900, which was bought from Gucci and is made of ostrich skin. Likewise, the most evening jacket he owns is also from Gucci, as cost $9,800. 'The most expensive leather pants, $5,600,' he added. 'The most expensive jeans, $2,500. The most expensive pair of boots, $2,600. The most expensive pair of gloves, $1,015.' Mr Bissinger now says that while he does not regret the GQ piece, it did lead to some widespread misconceptions about his state of mind. Regardless, he considers the article his ‘way of bottoming out and knowing that I needed in-treatment help. I could no longer continue the way I was living.’ He checked into rehab days after the article was published - and revealed what it was like in an interview with Vanity Fair earlier this year. 'I think everybody should go to rehab,' he said. 'It’s called rehab, but it’s 60 days of stepping out of your life and thinking very hard and working, because you’re seeing therapists basically 12 hours a day.' Making positive changes! Mr Bissinger at the Friday Night Lights premiere in October 2004 - before his clothing choices got more ambitious . Mr Bissinger has since put all his clothing in to a climate-controlled storage facility, which is where Luxeswap's founder went to retrieve it. ‘I pay $244 a month for an enormous storage locker. It looks like the mob just stole a truck from Gucci and Ferragamo and Prada. It’s gorgeous.’ Mr Bissinger admitted ‘I really do have a lot of clothing, if anyone wants in.’ While Mr Bissinger says that he no longer searches for himself on Google or Twitter, he has made a promise to journalists who are nice to him in their future coverage of his life. If by some chance he finds their articles sans Google, he may give them a leather jacket. ‘I’ve got a lot of them,’ he said. ‘Like 80.'","Mr Bissinger has enlisted online retailer Luxeswap to auction off nearly 150 pieces from his collection, including women's and men's jackets, pants, and shoes .

"Authorities are searching for a gunman after a meteorologist for a Texas TV station was shot multiple times while leaving the studio this morning. Patrick Crawford, the morning weatherman for KCEN in Bruceville-Eddy near Waco, had climbed into his car around 9.15am on Wednesday when the man approached and they exchanged words. The suspect, a man in his 30s, pulled out a semi-automatic handgun and shot Crawford repeatedly in the body and arm as he sat in his car, DPS Trooper D.L. Wilson said. Crawford managed to back up at high speed and drive out of the parking lot. He crossed the interstate and drove to a group of construction workers, who administered first aid and called 911. Crawford, who grew up in Plano, Texas and earned his meteorology degree from Northern Illinois University, moved from New Orleans and joined the station in September 2012 . 'He was entering the car when the exchange of gunfire, or the gunfire started,' Senior Trooper DL Wilson with Highway Patrol told KHOU. 'He did an excellent job getting in the car speeding off and probably saved his life.' He was taken to Scott and White Memorial Hospital in Temple and underwent surgery. Crawford's friends told KCEN that he is doing well and that doctors said he is 'very lucky'. As he drove off, the suspect fled on foot. 'He is considered armed and dangerous at this time,' Wilson said. 'We're still going with a white male, 30 to 35, receding hairline, had a black hoodie and dark-colored pants.' Police have launched a massive search for the suspect, who was described as a white male aged between 30 and 35. He was dressed in dark clothing and has a receding hairline. On Wednesday afternoon, authorities said they had a person of interest in custody, but KXXV later reported that it was not the gunman. Instead, the man in custody, who does not speak English, had been seen running from the area because he had warrants out for his arrest.

Response: Texas Department of Public Safety officers ride in a pickup to a command post while other officers look for the gunman accused of shooting Crawford outside the station on Wednesday . Hunt: Officers swarmed the scene and the station and local schools were put on lockdown this morning . Speaking on Wednesday afternoon, Trooper Wilson said Crawford had not recognized his attacker. Authorities have still not said if the shooting was random. Station officials had no comment early Wednesday afternoon but may release one later in the day. Crawford, who grew up in Plano, Texas and earned his meteorology degree from Northern Illinois University, moved from New Orleans and joined the station in September 2012. He is married to fellow meteorologist and KCEN producer Heather Brinkmann. This morning, he showed off his winning Christmas sweater for the station's 'Ugly Sweater Contest' and shared images online of him raising a trophy just hours before he was shot. The town is about 75 miles north of Austin. Recovering: Crawford, who has been with the station for two years, managed to drive away and when his car crashed, construction workers ran to his aid.

"Birmingham has been named among the top 10 most exciting destinations to visit in 2015, in a list compiled annually by the travel guidebook series Rough Guides. The city, which is the only UK location to have been selected by the publication's travel editors, is joined by worldwide tourist destinations including Johannesburg, Malaga, New Orleans, Hamburg and Wellington. Rough Guides selected Birmingham in its annual list for 'embracing its industrial heritage'. Birmingham's Bull Ring offers huge variety to those who enjoy some retail therapy . Edgbaston Cricket Ground will host the upcoming Test Match between England and Australia . Cadbury world details Birmingham as the centre of the chocolate word and is a family-popular destination . The publication also notes that 'with Birmingham New Street station reopening in 2015, this year is the ideal time to make a trip.' Lottie Gross, from Rough Guides, said: 'Every year, Rough Guides editors and authors get together to compile a list of the destinations they think will be best to visit in the next 12 months. Johannesburg (South Africa) Málaga (Spain) New Orleans (USA) Hamburg (Germany) Nizwa (Oman) Wellington (New Zealand) Belgrade (Serbia) Salta (Argentina) Birmingham (UK) Yangon (Myanmar) 'From the vibrant Bull Ring markets to the fashionable creative quarter in Digbeth, Birmingham makes a worthy entry in the 2015 list for its cultural variety, excellent shopping and a buzzing live music scene that's among the best in the UK.' Emma Gray, director of marketing services at Visit Birmingham, the city's official leisure tourism programme, added: 'Birmingham's inclusion in Rough Guides' acclaimed shortlist is testament to the city's increasing appeal as one of the most attractive places in the world to visit. 'The city's global reputation continues to grow. As well as welcoming a record 34 million people last year, Birmingham also attracted a 32 per cent rise in international visitors – a greater increase than anywhere else in the UK. 'With a spectacular 2015 in store thanks to a number of exciting new developments and events, we look forward to offering even more to our visitors next year than ever before.' Birmingham is preparing for one of its most important years in over a decade. Highlights in 2015 include the completion of the £600million redevelopment of New Street Station, plus the openings of high end retail development Grand Central – including a flagship John Lewis store – and the UK's first integrated destination leisure complex, Resorts World Birmingham. Birmingham's Custard Factory proves an exciting, and popular destination for tourists . The city will also welcome two matches of the Rugby World Cup at Villa Park, and the third Ashes Test Match between England and Australia at Edgbaston Stadium. Chris Montgomery, Network Rail's project director for the Birmingham New Street project, said: 'Birmingham is a great place to visit and with the new New Street Station nearing completion it just keeps getting better. 'Before the project started the station was dark, unwelcoming and overcrowded with poor access for passengers. The first section of the new station opened in April 2013 and it provides a fantastic experience for visitors. But visitors to the city will be even more impressed when they step off their trains after September next year when the station will be brighter and lighter and provide a great first impression of the city.' Key Birmingham attractions such as the Custard Factory, the Bull Ring shopping centre and Cadbury World  attract tourists from all over the world. In 2012, Birmingham was named number 19 in the New York Times' '45 Places to Go' – the only English city outside of London to be selected. The city's foodie credentials and diverse dining scene earned the city the nineteenth spot in the shortlist, with local talents including Aktar Islam of Lasan Restaurant and Michelin star chefs Glynn Purnell, Richard Turner and Luke Tipping praised for their culinary flair.

"Two children have been rescued from squalor after sheriffs found them living in a home where feces covered the walls and rooms were caked in mold and rotting food. The two-year-old girls - who have not been named - were found in a stinking home in Venice, Florida, after law enforcement were called to a disturbance at the house.

The children's bedroom, according to the deputies, was particularly ridden by feces. In the bathroom, the shower contained a kiddie pool reportedly filled with stagnant water covered in a brown film, while mold coated the floor. In the kitchen, the report said, there were dirty dishes and pans piled high, with decaying food inside. White film: Stagnant water was found in the sinks, along with pans still clogged with rotting food . In the sink sheriffs described stagnant water covered with a white, milky film, while an outside patio was reportedly covered in garbage and cigarette butts. According to NBC2, Davis told deputies that she cleaned the house every day and didn't think the conditions were a problem. Reports said that when talking to sheriffs after their arrest both said the other was a 'danger' to their children.
