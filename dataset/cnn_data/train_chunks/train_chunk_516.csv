A mother has warned of the dangers of keeping Bullmastiffs after her two-year-old daughter was mauled when their 'good family dog' turned on her 'out of nowhere'. The animal has been put down following the attack on Katie-Scarlett Belsten-Rogers. Her mother Julie Belsten, of Penybont, Llandrindod Wells, Powys, Wales, is warning other parents about the dangers of English Bullmastiffs around young children. Bloodied: Two-year-old Katie-Scarlett Belsten-Rogers was left with several injuries afte being savaged by the pet. Her mother is now warning of the dangers of keeping English Bullmastiffs around young children . 'She was only playing in the kitchen, then when she walked past the dog, out of nowhere, it went for her face.' The dog managed to take the skin off of the youngster’s eyebrow, as well as pierce two holes underneath one of her eyes, the bridge of her nose and by the side of her mouth, with its teeth. 'What is even more terrifying is that it could have been a whole lot worse than this!' said Julie. The English Bullmastiff belonged to Julie’s boyfriend's mother and was put down following the incident. 'People, parents especially, need to be made aware that these dogs around young children can be really dangerous. 'It’s an absolutely awful thing to see your child go through and I would not wish it on anyone, that’s why I want to warn parents to keep these dogs away from their children because they are really nasty dogs. (File picture) The English Bullmastiff belonged to Julie¿s boyfriend's mother and was put down following the incident . 'The picture really says all that I could possibly say, I want people to see what these dogs can do,' she said. Prior to the attack, Julie, said she had no real concerns about the dog called Marleen. 'It had gone for other dogs in the past but never children or other people, for that matter. Katie-Scarlett had been around the dog before, I’d never had any reason to worry about her with the dog until that occasion.' The advert for the rescue dog of six months described it as 'a good family dog, that was good with pets and good with children.' 'None of that was true, there were no warning signs, it’s terrifying,' said Julie. The Bullmastiff owes its origins by . cross breeding 60 per cent of the English Mastiff and 40 per cent of the . Bulldog in England during the 1800s. It was originally used to protect animal farms from thieves and primarily used as watchdogs that raised an alarm to any intrusion. The breed is large, with a powerful bodyframe, but it is also an intelligent and agile dog, which makes it an excellent watchdog. However, Bullmastiffs are aggressive when provoked and strong enough to catch hold of an man, pin him down to the floor and hold him there for long periods of time. Trainers say a firm, although not harsh, approach . is needed to discipline them properly, or else things may get out of control. They also say this dog breed must be taught to socialise at an early age, as it can . become aggressive towards other dogs and strangers.","Mother of Katie-Scarlett Belsten-Rogers, Julie Belsten, was left horrified .

Germany last night warned Britain ‘you won’t be happy alone’ in the world, amid deepening tensions over David Cameron’s threat to veto an increase in the EU’s vast budget. Chancellor Angela Merkel, who visited Downing Street for talks with the Prime Minister last night, even raised the spectre of the Second World War as she issued a provocative suggestion that the UK would flounder on its own outside the EU. British officials said that despite Mrs Merkel’s visit to attempt to broker an agreement ahead of a crunch EU budget summit this month, chances of a deal were rapidly receding. Scroll down for video . 'Alone they would not be happy in this world': Angela Merkel made the comments ahead of dinner with David Cameron at Downing Street tonight . Warm welcome: Mr Cameron greeted the German leader with a kiss on the steps of 10 Downing Street, ahead of a meeting expected to be dominated by the increasingly tense talks on the EU's 2014-2020 budget . Mrs Merkel has set out her vision of a more closely integrated EU core ¿ one likely to antagonise British eurosceptics still further .

'You can be very happy on an island - but alone they would not be happy in this world' German Chancellor Angela Merkel . But Mrs Merkel’s suggestion that she . would ‘do everything’ to keep Britain in the EU is likely to be seized . upon by Mr Cameron as an indication that she is ready to offer . concessions on budget demands. ‘I want a strong Britain in the EU. Britain was there when we were liberated from National Socialism,’ the . German leader said, in a reference to the end of the Second World War. ‘I cannot imagine Britain not to be . part of Europe. I think that it is good for it, too, to be part of . Europe. When you are somewhere alone in a seven billion-strong global . population, I don’t think it is good for Britain. ‘You can be very happy on an island – but alone they would not be happy in this world.’ Mrs Merkel, speaking in the European . Parliament in Brussels before travelling to London for dinner with Mr .

A protester holds a petrol bomb during clashes with riot police as the demonstration quickly turned violent . Mr Cameron has expressed outrage that . the European Commission is seeking an £80billion budget rise for the . seven-year period from 2014, accusing it of ‘doing nothing’ to tighten . its belt while member states imposed austerity measures. The Prime . Minister last night urged Mrs Merkel to stick to a letter she signed in . 2010 calling for a real-terms freeze in EU spending. Government sources said different . sides in the budget row were so far from agreement that a summit due to . start on November 22 was likely to collapse. That would mean the 27 EU . leaders reconvening next year to try to hammer out a deal. If an agreement cannot be reached by . the end of the year, the existing budget will roll on, plus inflation – . meaning Britain will be required to pay more. In a sign of increasing impatience . with Britain in Brussels, French MEP Joseph Daul, chairman of the main . centre-Right EPP group in the European Parliament, last night called for . an end to what remains of the UK’s historic budget rebate. The British Conservatives used to . belong to the EPP group, along with Mrs Merkel’s CDU party, before Mr . Cameron pulled them out over their commitment to a federal Europe. Mr Daul, responding to an attack from . UKIP leader Nigel Farage, said he would accept an ‘amicable divorce’ of . Britain and the EU – but he wanted ‘custody of all the children’. Some . took that as a reference to an independent Scotland. Mr Farage told Mrs Merkel there was ‘growing anger in Britain’. Greek police today used tear gas to disperse demonstrators protesting outside parliament ahead of a key vote on a new round of austerity measures . The 13.5 billion euro package is expected to scrape through Parliament, following a hasty one-day debate, despite fierce public anger . Police and protestors clashed with fire and petrol bombs as the deeply unpopular austerity measures were depressed . ‘Why are we pumping £53million a day . of British taxpayers’ money into this Union? It is Britain’s place in . this Union that is the real question. And increasingly Britain looks . like a square peg in a round hole.’ A Downing Street spokesman said: ‘You . have got 27 countries sitting round the table and they all want . different things from the budget, so it is always going to be difficult . to get agreement. We are going to be arguing for an outcome that is in . Britain’s interests.’ At dinner last night, Mr Cameron . served Mrs Merkel spinach and mushroom tart, followed by venison, and a . German pudding, Donauwelle – a cake made from cherries, buttercream and . cocoa. There was also a cheese course, and the two leaders drank red . wine. As the two leaders discussed Britain's future in the EU, Greek protests ended in tears as outraged residents protested against the austerity bill the Government were voting on. Greek police fired tear gas and water cannon at protesters armed with petrol bombs last night during one of the biggest rallies in the country in months. The clashes came as the country’s parliament voted on a hugely unpopular austerity bill. Up to 100,000 people gathered in Athens¿ Syntagma Square, with some fighting running battles with riot police as the clashes turned ugly .

More . chaos reigned inside the assembly, where the session was interrupted . when parliamentary workers went on strike to protest against a clause . that would have cut their salaries. In a humiliating about-face, the . government was forced to cancel the measure. Outside, loud booms rang out as protesters hurled petrol bombs and rocks at police, who responded with tear gas, stun grenades and water cannons – the first time they had been used in an anti-austerity protest. Earlier in the evening, protesters braved a downpour, holding flags and banners saying ‘It’s them or us!’ and ‘End this disaster!’ Some held Italian, Portuguese and Spanish flags representing other nations facing austerity measures. ‘These measures are killing us little by little and lawmakers in there don’t give a damn,’ said Maria Aliferopoulou, a 52-year-old mother of two. ‘They are rich, they have everything and we have nothing and are fighting for crumbs, for survival.’ The proposed cuts and tax hikes, expected to be worth £10billion, are required to unlock a loan tranche of more than £20billion from the European Union and International Monetary Fund bailout.","Angela Merkel told the European Parliament she wants a 'strong Britain in the European Union'

Helping out: Esperanza Lozoya wraps tortillas packaged with ads asking for assistance in finding missing women and children, at the Hermanos Escobar Tortilla shop in Ciudad Juarez . The campaign, dubbed 'Disappearances in Juarez Must Disappear,' has been welcomed by shopkeepers and customers in the violence-wracked border city of Ciudad Juarez. The El Paso Times reported that a major part of the campaign is Alma Alerts, similar to the U.S. Amber Alerts. Tens of thousands of fliers and posters splashed with the faces of missing persons will also be popping up around the volatile city. The paper reported that Mexican officials will additionally make appearances at area schools to keep students in the know about proper safety when traveling to and from the classroom. Milk initiative: The tortilla wrapper campaign is reminiscent of the milk carton ads featuring missing children in the U.S. Ciudad Juarez was hit by a series of eerily similar killings of more than 100 mainly young women beginning in 1993. While those killings have tapered off, killings and disappearances continue. The wrappers have been distributed to 36 tortilla factories in the region, according to the El Paso Times.

Foreign lorry drivers are to be charged £10 a day to use British roads, ministers have announced. The levy is designed to counter the unfairness of UK hauliers paying tolls when driving across the continent. The tax, which will be capped at £1,000, is expected to raise more than £20million a year. Ministers say foreign lorries often cause more damage to roads than British hauliers . There are around 1.5 million trips by foreign registered HGVs in to the UK every year. Ministers claim foreign lorries are likely to cause more damage to British roads and they should make a contribution to their upkeep. Complex rules mean British lorry drivers will have also have to pay the HGV Road User Levy but will receive a rebate in the form of a cut to vehicle excise duty. Transport minister Stephen Hammond . said: ‘The Government believes that it is right that vehicles which . cause wear to our roads should make a payment to take account of this. ‘HGVs registered abroad are likely to carry more weight on fewer axles than UK registered vehicles. 'This means that foreign-registered vehicles are more damaging to the roads and it's therefore all the more unjust that they don't make a contribution towards the maintenance of the roads they use, leaving the burden to fall entirely on the British taxpayer.’ The levy is expected to raise between £18.7 million and £23.1 million in its first year of operation, starting in April 2014. Tory MP Andrew Percy warned there are still significant problems for the industry. He said: ‘It's a delight to know our UK haulage industry will be receiving a shot in the arm from this proposal. ‘There are still considerable challenges faced by the sector. I meet with them regularly and only over the summer was chatting to one local haulage firm who explained to me the particular challenges the sector faces in light of the rising fuel costs.’ He also criticised the ""convoluted"" process of creating a new levy that applied to British hauliers as well as foreign HGVs to comply with EU rules. Shadow transport minister Jim Fitzpatrick added: ‘The unfairness dealt to the UK road haulage industry is well documented and they have long pressed for this measure to defend British industry, to protect UK roads and to create a level playing field with their European competitors.’","Ministers say charge is fair because UK hauliers pay tolls on the continent .

Land Rover is embarking on a major new model and investment blitz that could see production more than double to 600,000 vehicles by 2020. It has a seven year plan that include a line-up of 16 different Land Rover variations including a family of six luxury Range Rovers, five leisure Discovery and Freelander models, and five iterations of the utilitarian Defenders. Ambitious Land Rover is aiming to capture around 3 per cent of the global sports utility market which experts predict will reach 22 million by 2020. The investment is a key part of £10billion investment planned by Jaguar land Rover over the next five years. It means big expansion at the firm’s Solihull plant near Birmingham which builds the Range Rover, Discovery and Defender models, and particularly at its Halewood factory on Merseyside which builds the Range Rover Evoque and Freelander models. Expansion is also planned in China and India. The firm inadvertently leaked the extent of its proposed 16-car line up when its design director Gerry McGovern flashed up a slide showing silhouettes of the proposed vehicles on a power-point display during a briefing on its new Range Rover which goes on sale in the New Year. New variants of the next generation of five and seven-seat Defender include a ‘crew cab’ pick-up truck. A soft-top version of the Evoque ‘baby’ Range Rover is in the pipeline, as well as an even smaller Evoque. A new flagship luxury Discovery is also touted, as well as a ‘baby’ Freelander. Details are revealed in the latest edition of the respected Autocar magazine and its website www.autocar.co.uk. Autocar’s associate editor Hilton Holloway who has been briefed by Land Rover sources says: ’Land Rover is on a roll. It is almost certainly the biggest investment that the UK car industry has ever seen. Leak: The future models of Land Rover were inadvertently leaked during a routine presentation . ‘The new aluminium production line at Solihull could produce 150,000 models per year at full stretch, which is the most profitable operating position. ‘With the new Range Rover shifting just over 40,000 units and the sport about 60,000,it leaves room for a range-topping aluminium Land Rover in a luxury segment that should be able to steal 50,000 of the 682,000 global sales.’ Of the proposed £10billion investment  not all will be in the UK, says Mr Holloway: 'About £1.8billion will be invested in anew Chinese plant that will have, in the first stages, have the capacity to build 130,000 vehicles per year, about 60 per cent of which will be Land Rover models. 'China is now Jaguar Land Rover’s second biggest market, just behind the UK, and Chinese tastes are  increasingly turning away from conventional luxury saloon cars towards sports utility vehicles.’ Digging in: The DC100 Defender is one of a string of new models set to roll off the production line . Land Rover sold nearly 50,000 vehicles in China in the first eight months of the year and its 96 Chinese dealerships is set to grow by a further 47. Mr Holloway said: ’Perhaps the biggest area where Land Rover can make headway is in the mid-market ‘leisure sector’ where six million annual sales are up for grabs. As land Rover’s future line-up shows, it needs to build a family of cars in the sector where the current Freelander and Discovery compete.’ ‘The new ‘leisure’ range would be partly built in the UK – suggesting that Halewood would need to expand. Significantly in a few years. ‘The new defender family will probably be built mostly in India, with European versions using a significant number of Indian-sourced sub-assemblies.’ The land rover market .

With tears streaming down her face, Britain’s most prolific woman fraudster clearly realised her game was up. Maria Michaela’s mask of deception slipped when she was confronted by police – and she was still weeping when this mugshot was taken. The 33-year-old, who used more than a dozen identities to con almost £15million out of high street banks, was jailed today for nine years. Sobbing: Maria Michaela, crying in her police mugshot, ripped off banks in an elaborate mortgage fraud . Facing prison: Maria Michaela has been convicted of the massive fraud in which she assumed up to a dozen identities. Passport photos show her in various guises used to defraud money out of banks . Posing as an heiress worth £250million, she used fake documents to con her way to a fortune. She cheated the banks by claiming she was an heiress to the luxury Sun City resort in South Africa worth £250million. Exclusive: This home in Chelsea's Cheyne Walk is one of several properties Maria Michaela bought in a con totalling £13m . A senior banker at HBOS gave her  four . loans worth £10.5million, and she repeated the con at RBS and was . given  a further £2.5million. She used the money to buy luxury homes . in some of the most expensive districts of London, including a . £3.5million home in Chelsea and a mews property in Belgravia, close to . Buckingham Palace. The banks which lent her the money . thought they were going to get it back when Michaela sold on the . properties at a profit. However, the bankers were unaware that she had . bribed chartered surveyor Mary-Jane Rathie, a policeman’s wife, to write . fictitious reports in which she doubled the real value of the . properties. This meant that Michaela, who is from Mauritius, received loans which were far higher than the cost of the houses she bought. Michaela gave Rathie, 44, £910,000 in . cash, a £143,000 Bentley Continental and a £49,000 Range Rover Sport as a . reward for her part in the scam. Michaela then defaulted on her . mortgage payments and disappeared for three years. Police finally caught her in January . and discovered thousands of stolen identity documents which she had been . using to submit fake mortgage applications. Today Detective Inspector Andy . Fife, of City of London Police, said: ‘We think she is the biggest . female fraudster. We have not had any female on this scale before.’ Police suspect the true scale of Michaela’s fraud during her 11 years in the UK may be far higher than is currently known. Jailing her at Harrow Crown Court, . Judge Graham Aering said: ‘You were a very experienced, highly skilled, . and exceptionally well-equipped fraudster. ‘These frauds were carefully and . professionally planned. Scam: The con-artist had at least a dozen identities, pictured left as Bruna Louise, and right as she really looks . 'They involved the hijacking of other people’s . identities and extensive use of fraudulently-created  identity . documents.’ Michaela admitted two counts of fraud, three counts of . conspiracy to defraud and two charges of conspiracy to money-launder at a . previous hearing. She appeared in the dock alongside accomplices Guy Steel, Stephen Hunter-Scott  and Saba Humadi. Hunter-Scott, 53, of Fulham, West . London, admitted three counts of conspiracy to defraud, two counts of . conspiracy to money launder, and possession of false identity documents. He was jailed for five years. Humadi, 56, of Battersea, South London, was given a 12-month  sentence suspended for two years for money laundering. Steel, 51, of Knightsbridge, Central London, was jailed for four years for money laundering and attempted robbery. Rathie, from Finchley, North London, was jailed for six years last year. Accomplice: Mary-Jane Rathie outside the Old Bailey, accepted more than £1m in gifts after she gave inflated valuations for homes in London's most exclusive neighbourhoods .

Giving a nod to Mitt Romney’s heavy defeat on Tuesday, Saturday Night Live began their weekly show with the defeated Massachusetts governor drowning his sorrows – with milk. Jason Sudeikis reprised his role as Romney during the cold open, sneaking dairy products on the back of his expansive balcony. ‘Darn it all to heck,’ he began. Numerous members of his family – including Kate McKinnon as his wife Ann and Taran Killam as his sons Tag, Matt, and Josh – came outside to try and comfort him, to no avail. Killam as Tag said that his father’s loss made him want to ‘punch America in the face.’ SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Pensive: Jason Sudeikis, right, played Mitt Romney in the cold open, joined by Taran Killam, left as they reflected on his presidential loss . Getting fresh: Ann Romney, played by Kate McKinnon, acts surprised as Sudeikis shows physical affection . Does the body good: Sudeikis drowned his sorrow in milk, one hidden in the shrubs and another in his shoe; Romney was pictured with a gallon of chocolate milk following his loss . SNL took it aim on the Republican presidential candidate, after he lost the Electoral College vote tally 332 to 206 in Tuesday’s election. In the skit, Romney’s family was throwing a dignified post-election soiree, but Sudeikis had retired to the balcony to chug Vitamin D milk. Romney himself was pictured with a gallon of chocolate milk following the disappointing loss. Sudeikis’ son, Killam as Tag Romney, came out to ask what more he wanted to accomplish. ‘I have so much I want to do,’ Sudeikis said. ‘I want to find out how mayonnaise is made.’ After ‘cracking open’ another carton of milk, Killam as Matt comes out, begging his father to come into the house. ‘Paul Ryan is doing feats of strength in the living room,’ he said. Sudeikis responded with vitriol. ‘I would’ve liked to see him carry Wisconsin.’ A concerned Killam then asked, ‘Have you been drinking? You smell like a dairy.’ Sudeikis offers his son a drink, but Killam sounds horrified. ‘I’m only 38!’ he said. A third son, Josh, tries to entice his father into the party. ‘Donald Trump is doing a very amusing thing where he’s racist,’ Killam said. My way or the highway: Jay Pharoah again played Obama, saying that he was not going to let anything stand in his way during his second term . Four more years: Pharoah said he was a little surprised at the election outcome, saying Republicans had his defeat in the bag - high unemployment, high gas prices, and a bad first debate performance to boot . But it’s not until McKinnon comes out again that Sudeikis really gets fired up. He kisses her on the lips, causing McKinnon to say in shock: ‘My, oh my, what has gotten into you?’ Sudeikis responds: ‘Oh, I don’t know, about 10 gallons of milk.’ On Weekend Update, Seth Meyers celebrated ‘four...more…years…of gridlock,’ showing pictures of Republicans Nancy Pelosi and John Boehner. Noting how the president won many unemployed and student voters, Meyers noted: ‘Basically, Obama became president the same way Budweiser became the king of beer.’ Meyers also commented on the David Petraeus scandal, noting the name of biographer Paula Broadwell’s biography on him, entitled ‘All In.’ ‘When they first started working on the book,’ Meyers said, ‘it was called “Just The Tip.”’ Meyers was joined by Jay Pharoah, playing the newly re-elected President Obama. Asked if he was surprised by the result, Pharoah responded: ‘A little. Come on Republicans, what happened? This was yours to win! Brokeback Maine-ton: Bill Hader, left, and Fred Armisen, right, played a gay couple from Maine dressed in fisherman's sweaters, wool caps, and waders . Angry: Bobby Moynihan played a drunk uncle on Weekend Update, bemoaning the fact that he never graduated from Electoral College . ‘Five-dollar gas, eight percent unemployment, I even gave you a first-debate head start!  nd on top of that, I’m Black.’ But Pharoah said that as a second-term president, he wasn’t going to concede to those who were against him. ‘Look out!’ he said. ‘From here on out, we do it my way! Republicans don’t want to talk of immigration? Fine. Meanwhile, a gay Hispanic woman is born every 15 seconds.’ Speaking of what has traditionally been a bipartisan dead end between him and Boehner, he said: ‘Fine, you wanna be unreasonable, fine let’s be unreasonable. The military? Gone! If you want to go to war with Iran, you have to send in Ted Nugent.’ The ‘president’ seemed to be energized, and kept bouncing his shoulders. When Meyers commented, Pharoah responded: ‘Seth, I’m in a good place. 'I want to thank Mitt Romney. Governor, I admire your tenacity, even though watching you run for president was like watching someone in roller skates trying to climb stairs.’ Leading lady: This week's episode was hosted by Anne Hathaway, who plays Fantine in the upcoming film adaptation of Les Miserables . Though he said he was glad for four more years in office, Pharoah’s closing remarks were over how awful his job is. ‘Mainly, this is a terrible job and I hate it,’ he said. Also appearing on Weekend Update were a gay couple from Maine, which just passed a gay marriage law, and a drunk uncle to talk about the election recount. Anne Hathaway, who plays Fantine in the upcoming movie version of Les Miserables, hosted for a third time, and Rihanna was the musical guest.

It will no doubt outrage sports fans left exasperated by the network's delayed coverage, including the hotly-anticipated men's 100m race on Sunday, where Usain Bolt set a new Olympic record. In charge: Olympics executive producer Jim Bell, centre, is overseeing the Games coverage. He stands with Meredith Vieira, Ann Curry, Jim Bell, Matt Lauer, and Bryant Gumbel earlier this year . But Bell has repeatedly stood by his decision to broadcast the biggest events during prime time, blaming financial pressures and interests of advertisers. 'When a company invests the kind of money . that we have in the Olympics we have absolutely every right to protect . that investment,' Bell told Media Bistro. It shows a surprising lack of empathy from the executive producer, who himself was a sportsman. Bell was a defensive linesman for Harvard in his college days. Bell, who is married with four sons, joined the network in 1990 when he . was hired to profile athletes for the 1992 Barcelona Games, and joined the . Today show as its executive producer in 2005. Top job: Bell, right, chats with Ann Curry, Bill Clinton and U.S. actress Mindy Kaling on the Today show, where he has worked as executive producer for seven years . Stubborn: Bell, pictured with morning TV hosts Hoda Kotb, Joy Bauer and Kathie Lee Gifford, has refused to apologise for delaying Olympic broadcasts, citing financial pressures . This is the first time he is in charge of the coverage of the Games after taking over from Dick Ebersol, who oversaw eight Olympic productions. 'I feel very comfortable,' Bell, who has worked as executive producer for the Today show for seven years, told . the New York Times before the Games. The relaxed attitude comes despite fans lambasting the delayed coverage. 'How can NBC be so inept? How many . senior execs will be canned? How high will the cleaning go? It'll . probably be delayed,' one angry viewer tweeted after Bolt's race on . Sunday. 'Would have been nice if NBC chose to broadcast it live. NBC really values its audience,' a fellow track fan tweeted. James Poniewozik, Time magazine TV . critic, tweeted: 'NBC tape delay coverage is like the airlines: its . interest is in giving you the least satisfactory service you will still . come back for.' Bell responded: 'You do know that all sports events are being streamed live right?' Way behind: NBC was lambasted for broadcasting Usain Bolt's 100m victory four hours after it happened . Highlight: Even web users had trouble viewing live streaming of Bolt, pictured with teammate Yohan Blake . Annoyed: Viewers flocked to Twitter to rant about the delayed viewing - and question who had been in charge . 'I do, indeed!' Poniewozik said. 'Have enjoyed it. Apparently a lot of folks still prefer watching it on TV.' Birthdate July 20, 1967 . Hometown Branford, Connecticut . Education B.A. in government, Harvard. Played football as a defensive linebacker . Marital status Married with four sons . Work history Joined NBC out of college in 1990 to profile athletes for 1992 Barcelona Olympics; became coordinating producer and programming supervisor for NBC Olympics; producer for NBC broadcasts of the NFL, MLB, and the NBA; joined Today in 2005 as executive producer; won Emmys for his work on 1992, 1996, 2000 and 2002 Olympics . Despite these claims, web users . complained they were unable to watch Usain Bolt's race live as the NBC's live streaming began . 'buffering' just before the race. 'Usain Bolt outruns the NBC live stream's buffer!' one Twitter user, Zach Mast, joked. 'NBC live stream completely failed to keep up with the men's 100M. Usain Bolt is faster than the internet,' another added. Bell, who is based in Midtown in Manhattan, has repeatedly stood by his decision to delay the best moments until prime time. 'We’ve tried to utilise new technology to stream everything live,' he added to Media Bistro. 'But the fact is, and . the numbers would seem to bear this out, there's still a huge audience . out there who want to watch this stuff at a time when it is . convenient for them, when there are mass audiences. 'This is one thing . you watch together. And if you kind of end up giving it away on TV you’re not protecting your investment and you’re not . serving the audience and you’re not serving the affiliates and you’re . not serving the advertisers.' Smile of a winner: NBC also came under fire for showing an advert of a monkey competing in gymnastics shortly after African American Gabby Douglas, pictured, won the gold medal . Outrage: The network was forced to apologise after the advert of the monkey, pictured . The network spent $1.2 billion for the rights to the Games and producing the coverage is expected to cost $150 million. Despite earning $1 billion on advertising, it will be operating at a loss. The Bolt fiasco is just the latest in a string of scheduling faux pas. During the Opening Ceremony, the network cut a tribute to the victims of the 2005 London terrorist bombings, which claimed the lives of 52 people, including one New Yorker. Despite the global impact of the . tragedy, NBC cut the dance routine and tribute, claiming it wasn't . tailored for an American audience. Instead, it showed a bland interview between Ryan Seacrest and U.S. swimmer Michael Phelps. Bad start: NBC edited out a tribute to the victims of the 2005 bomb attacks in London in the Opening Ceremony . 'Not for the U.S.': The tribute featured an image gallery of loved ones who had lost their lives . Shock: Viewers flocked to Twitter to vent their anger - but Bell said the cut was down to time constraints . Bell defended the decision, claiming it was edited out due to time constraints. 'We’re sitting there at 12:30 in the morning in London, that’s 7:30 in . the United States,' said Bell. 'We’re on the air and we’re having to . make decisions in real time.' The network was also forced to apologise after airing an ad featuring a monkey performing gymnastics, right after showing the performance of Gabby Douglas, the first African-American to win Olympic gold. The Today show has also experienced its own string of setbacks, after host Ann Curry was kicked out of the job in June. Her replacement, Savannah Guthrie, has struggled to keep viewers and the morning show has suffered low ratings.","Jim Bell, 45, is overseeing all Olympics scheduling on NBC .

"By . Alex Ward . PUBLISHED: . 04:26 EST, 27 October 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 05:51 EST, 27 October 2012 . A 61-year-old woman has given birth to twins to become one of the world's oldest mothers. Antonia Asti gave birth for the first time through artificial insemination at a hospital in Santos, near Sao Paulo in Brazil after trying to have a baby for more than 30 years. The retired secretary and her carpenter husband Jose, 55, wanted a family as soon as they got married and after years of trying and several IVF attempts, they finally have the children they dreamt of thanks to ten-year-old frozen embryos. Mum at 61: Antonia Asti gave birth to twins on Tuesday to become one of the world's oldest mothers after she and her husband Jose, 55, tried for years to have children . Twins Sofia and Roberto were born, each weighing 2lbs, on Tuesday by caesarean section, just a week after Ms Asti celebrated her 61st birthday. Ms Asti told Brazil’s Globo G1 website: ‘I'm so thrilled. All I ever wanted to be is a mother, and now my dream has finally come true. ‘I fought for this for so long. I never for one moment thought about giving up. 'We never had a lot of money but we saved a lot to achieve our dreams.’ The couple sought professional help in 1992 after years of trying and when Ms Asti was 51, they tried IVF treatment but were unsuccessful. Sofia and Roberto: The twins were born by caesarian section through artificial insemination with 10-year-old frozen embryos . Desperate to be a mother, Ms Asti then decided to adopt but was rejected because of her age. Ms Asti then tried artificial insemination using eggs fertilised with her husband’s sperm but the first three attempts also failed. When she decided to try a fourth time, doctors at the Sao Lucas Hospital in Santos warned her that the frozen embryos were nearly ten-years-old and the procedure was less likely than ever to work. Dr Orlando de Castro Neto, a specialist in assisted reproduction at the hospital, said: ‘The embryos were preserved from the first fertilisation but they have a validity of ten years, more or less, and they were reaching their end. Final attempt: Dr Orlando de Castro Neto said that frozen embryos have a validity of more or less ten years so this was their 'last resort' ‘But she said she wanted to use them for a new and final attempt, as a last resort.’ She is believed to be South America's oldest first-time mother. Ms Asti said: ‘I'm well. I'm quite capable of raising these children despite my age. ‘I don't consider myself to be 61. I think someone must have made a mistake on my birth certificate.’ A spokesman for the hospital said yesterday: ‘The mother is in good condition and well, despite the higher risk that an advanced aged can bring to a pregnancy. ‘The babies are doing well, although will stay in hospital for a few more weeks until they reach ideal weight.’ The world’s oldest mother is believed to be farmer’s wife Omkari Panwar who had twins by IVF in India in 2008 at the age of 70.

David Cameron yesterday visited a refugee camp on the Syrian border as he announced that he and newly re-elected President Barack Obama will consider military options to remove dictator Bashar al Assad. Mr Cameron said he and Mr Obama would make hastening the end of the Assad regime a priority as he was greeted by cheering young girls at the Za'atari refugee camp, which holds 20,000 of the 200,000 refugees who have fled Syria for Jordan. Earlier he visited the border area where 500 refugees are crossing every day as the death toll from the civil war climbs towards 40,000.

Teacher: Mr Cameron meets children and teachers in a classroom at the Za'atri refugee camp . Mr Cameron said: 'One of the first things I want to talk to Barack about is how we must do more to try and solve this crisis.' Cabinet Office officials have been . told to examine how Britain could get around a European Union arms . embargo on Syria to funnel weapons directly to opposition fighters. No-fly zones imposed by RAF jets and . direct Western air strikes have not been 'ruled out'. Those options will . be discussed when Mr Cameron chairs a meeting of the National Security . Council on Syria next week. Diplomatic talks are also planned . between the UK’s special envoy to the Syrian opposition John Wilkes and . rebel military chiefs in an effort to ‘help shape the opposition’, Mr . Cameron said. Mr Cameron, . who is now closing a three-day Middle East tour, said: ‘I wanted to hear . for myself the stories of people who have been bombed and shot and . blasted out of their homes in Syria.’ The . 46-year-old criticised the ‘deeply-illegitimate and unpleasant regime . that is raining down death and destruction on its own people’ and said . it was ‘truly horrendous to hear those stories’. Mr . Cameron added: ‘It just redoubles my determination that now, with a . newly-elected American president, we have got to do more to help this . part of the world, to help Syria achieve transition.’ Warm welcome: Syrian school girls cheer during Mr Cameron's visit to Za'atri refugee camp on Wednesday .

Handshake: King Abdullah II of Jordan with Mr Cameron at the Royal Palace in Amman, Jordan, on Wednesday . The Prime Minister travelled by . helicopter to a valley dominated by the Al Wahdah dam, which is one of . the busiest crossing points and was recently hit by Syrian shells. Some . of those arriving seeking shelter in Jordan had walked for up to 15 . days to reach the border, he was told by the local Jordanian military . chief. 'I wanted to hear for myself the stories of people who have been bombed and shot and blasted out of their homes' Prime Minister David Cameron . At the camp, he met . some of those recently arrived in the country and was treated to a . patriotic Syrian song by young girls at one of the classroom tents set . up for the many children living there. Mr Cameron told them: ‘You are not just missed in Syria. All of the world wants to help you, including my country.’ Speaking about the moves to set up talks . with the rebel military leaders, he said: ‘There is an opportunity for . Britain, for America, for Saudi Arabia, Jordan and like-minded allies to . come together and try to help shape the opposition, outside Syria and . inside Syria, and try to help them achieve their goal, which is our goal . of a Syria without Assad.’ Posing up: Mr Cameron meets female students at Dar Al-Hekma University in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, on Tuesday . Entrance: Mr Cameron speaks to the Governor of Mecca, Khalid al Faisal, as he arrives in Jeddah on Tuesday . It's an honour: Mr Cameron receives the King Abdullah Decoration One from King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia . It is a recognition that events are increasingly dictated by the military figures and not the splintered political groupings, who met in Qatar this week in an effort to forge an alliance against Mr Assad. 'Now, with a newly-elected American president, we have got to do more to help this part of the world, to help Syria achieve transition' Prime Minister David Cameron . And there are rising concerns that extremists are gaining a major influence inside opposition forces. Mr Cameron left open again the possibility that the president could be allowed to flee the country voluntarily to a state where he could evade any criminal charges against him over the slaughter which has killed upwards of 30,000 people so far. ‘I would like to see him face justice but, frankly, any option that involves him leaving the country and a transition taking place would be good for the people right behind me here,’ he said.

At present 2.5million people inside Syria need humanitarian assistance and the number of refugees in the surrounding region is predicted to almost double to 710,000 by the end of the year. 'I would like to see (Syrian President Bashar Assad) face justice but, frankly, any option that involves him leaving the country and a transition taking place would be good for the people right behind me here' Prime Minister David Cameron . That could mean a quarter of a million alone in Jordan. Of the new aid, £9.5million will go on blankets, soap and food for those forced out of their homes within Syria and on emergency help for the 8,300 Palestinian refugees based in Syria. The rest - taking total UK aid to ease the crisis to £53.5million - will be used to help those who have fled to Iraq, Jordan, Lebanon and Turkey - including safe transport from the border to the camps where they are being housed. Mr Cameron will fly back to the UK after meeting with the King of Jordan for talks with German Chancellor Angela Merkel but will not arrive in time for Prime Minister’s Questions in the Commons.","Cameron hears 'horrendous' stories of suffering from refugees at Za’atri .

Heartless: A warden driving a traffic enforcement car slowed down to capture Mr Padden's van details on the vehicle's inbuilt camera before pulling away . Mr Paddon, a former corporal in the RAF who completed seven tours of Iraq and three of Afghanistan, was then sent a £75 fine for being illegally parked. Mr Paddon appealed against the fine but Poole Borough Council has refused to cancel it despite the extenuating circumstances. Mr Paddon, who now works as an electrician, had been helping his father-in-law who suffers from a painful degenerative illness to pick up some fence posts at a DIY store in Poole, Dorset, when his mobility scooter got stuck in a pothole. It was at that moment that the council worked filmed the details of the Vauxhall Vivaro on October 20. Mr Paddon, who spent 12 years in the RAF, said: 'It is shocking. I’m utterly disgusted by it. The fact they slowed down to get the picture shows they would have seen me struggling to help Mick. 'But they decided to press on and issue the ticket regardless.

'I would have stopped to help whether I knew Mick or not - but it’s almost like they’re saying you can’t stop to help someone in need - you’ve got to find a parking space first. 'These people are supposed to be helping our community? I don’t think so. 'It does take a human being to take a look at these things and see what’s going on and use some judgement. There is no common sense or compassion.' Mr White, who served as a medic in the parachute regiment during the Suez Crisis, added: 'I can’t let him pay it - he was doing me a favour. It did upset me though. 'If I’d fallen off my scooter what is someone supposed to do - just drive past? 'That was the annoying part. They just took the photo and that was it, they weren’t interested if I was alright. 'If you become disabled don’t expect anyone to stop and help you. They might get punished for it.' Jason Benjamin, parking services manager at Poole Borough Council, said: 'Any vehicle parked on a pavement in a road where there are clearly marked no loading or waiting restrictions will automatically receive a penalty charge notice when patrolled by the camera safety car.

They are less than two weeks old, but these piglets already have wrinkles and are making history. The litter of eight Meishan piglets are the first of their kind to be born in the UK for thirty years. The breed, with their long floppy ears and wrinkly faces, is popular in China but has never been properly introduced in this country. One of a kind: The first litter of rare Meishan piglets in the UK for 30 years was born at Whauphill Farm in Dumfries and Galloway . Owner Linda McDonald-Brown, 51, brought . the litter’s year-old mother Miep and nine-month-old father Wrinkles . over from northern Holland with husband Graham, 47, last year. And two weeks ago Miep gave birth to seven girls and one boy. The couple plan to start the UK’s first pedigree line of the species and have already sold two of the litter to a smallholder in Essex. Linda, from Wigtown, Dumfries and Galloway, now intends to bring other boars in from Eastern Europe to create a foundation Meishan family from which every pig in the UK will descend. She said: ‘We are really pleased with the birth. They are the first to be born in this country for about 30 years so it’s very exciting to be involved. Proud mother: Miep gave birth to her new brood two weeks ago . Hello! Four of the piglets peek out from their sty. Meishans are a popular breed in China because of their unusually large ears and wrinkly faces . ‘We went across to Holland to stay with a friend who also breeds pigs. We didn’t set out with the intention of buying anything but when I saw them I just fell in love with them and bought two sows then and there and later a boar. ‘I have never seen anything like them in my life. ‘They are really prolific breeders in China and are very popular because of their unusual appearance and fatty meat but for some reason they have never taken off here and I want to change that.’ Owner Linda McDonald-Brown with mother and piglets. She has been breeding pigs for 15 years . Hot to trot: Two of the piglets frolick around in the grass outsie the sty . Curious: The litter contains seven girls and one boy and two have already been sold to a smallholder in Essex . The two sows and boar cost Linda £2,000 as a trio and each female can litter up to 15 babies. The Meishan species is native to southern China and when fully grown can measure up to three feet high and four feet long. Meishans were last seen in the UK over 30 years ago, when 20 pigs were imported from China by a British genetics company for research purposes, but the animals were never bred. The species’ ability to produce large litters means they have also become popular in the US and Canada in recent years. One big happy family: Mrs McDonald-Brown bought a trio of pigs for £2,000. Each female can litter up to 15 piglets . Best foot forward: The piglets take their some of their first tentative steps outside of the safety of their pigsty . Mother-of-two Linda, originally from Bideford, in Devon, has been breeding pigs for 15 years. She added: ‘Meishans are brilliant outdoor animals to have, they have a lovely temperament and they are brilliant with children. ‘They are not pets by any means - they can’t be kept in the house like micro-pigs, but they are fantastic to keep and it would be great to see them take off in this country.’","Litter of 8 Meishan piglets was born two weeks ago in Scotland .

Raja Aboutarik, 56, helped herself to £9,548 in housing benefit and £3,504 in council tax benefit between May 2006 and May last year. Moroccan-born Aboutarik was also receiving around £800 a month from the French government, West London Magistrates’ Court was told. She ‘clearly and deliberately’ provided false information in order to increase her living standards, said prosecutor Roger Hodkinson. ‘It was clear that some of it was money other than for expenses on the property,’ he told the court. ‘Ms Aboutarik was from 1999 receiving state benefits in France, and in fact Ms Aboutarik was arrested on suspicion of benefit fraud in August 2011.’ She raked in just over £58,000 from during the five-year swindle. It only came to an end when she was forced to admit she lived in her Paris home when the French authorities launched an investigation.

Sousan, a widow and mother of three, and Ali overcame their drug problems at the clinic, which is run by Iranian Laila Haidari. Bride Sousan and groom Ali got married at the 'Mother Camp' rehabilitation center for drug addicts on the outskirts of Kabul on Friday. Redemption: The ceremony took place at 'Mother Camp' rehabilitation centre for drug addicts. It was set up by Iranian documentary maker Laila Haidari . Taboo: Although drug use among women in Afghanistan is rampant, it is almost never talked about in the ultra-conservative nation . Haidari, a former documentary maker known as 'mother', runs a restaurant called Taj Begum, meaning 'Woman's Crown', and runs the shelter using the proceeds. She also employs addicts to provide them with a chance to rebuild their lives and learn new skills while helping her run the business. Treatment options for addicts in Afghanistan vary from the non-existent to limited. There is just one methadone substitution project, despite there being over one million users, according to the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC). There is also such a heavy stigma attached to drug addiction in ultra-conservative Afghanistan that drug use by females is almost never even mentioned. Opium production in Afghanistan has been on the rise since the U.S. occupation started in 2001. Both Sousan and Ali were addicted to opium. According to reports, around a million Afghans are addicted to drugs . The 'Mother Camp' rehabilitation centre is funded with the proceeds of a restaurant run by Haididi . Based on UNODC data, more land is now used for opium in Afghanistan than for growing cocoa in Latin America. Earlier today a gunman wearing an Afghan army uniform on Sunday shot and killed a member of the U.S.-led coalition forces fighting in Afghanistan - the latest in a spate of insider attacks that are fracturing the trust between NATO and Afghan forces. Separately, officials said 11 Afghan civilians were killed by land mines on Sunday in explosions in the east and south. Mohammad Zarak, spokesman for the governor of Helmand province, said the shooting took place in Nad Ali district after an argument between an Afghan soldier and coalition service members. His identity and nationality were not disclosed. Coalition figures show at least 60 coalition service members have been killed so far this year and others have been wounded in about 45 insider attacks, where members of the Afghan security forces or insurgents dressed in their uniforms turn their guns on U.S. and allied troops.","Newlyweds get married at rare clinic for nation's one million addicts .

Ross Doswell got a good reaction from his new fiancee Carly Richards after proposing to her with a giant sign made from hay . The romantic science graduate, 29, spelt out 'Carly Marry Me?' using huge piles of hay so big they could be seen by passing motorists. Ross placed a blindfold on girlfriend Carly Richards, 26, a charity worker, and led her to the field next to the A379 in Modbury, Devon. He then removed the blindfold and after she saw the huge message she quickly said 'yes'. Ross said the hay proposal took him, father Lance and brother Scott a day to set up.

During his opening speech to the 18th party congress, Mr Hu said of corruption: ‘If we fail to handle this issue well, it could prove fatal to the party, and even cause the collapse of the party and the fall of the state.’ Political theatre: Delegates attend the opening of the 18th Communist Party Congress at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing today. China's ruling Communist Party is ushering in a new group of younger leaders . Side-by-side: President Hu Jintao (left) and former President Jiang Zemin (right) attend the opening session . Mr Hu added senior officials should . strengthen ‘supervision over their families and their staff, and they . should never seek any privilege’. His warning comes after revelations . that the close family of outgoing premier Wen Jiabao was exposed as . having amassed around £2billion in ‘hidden riches’. And on the eve of the congress, . high-ranking politician Bo Xilai was formally expelled from the party, . following the murder of British businessman Neil Heywood by Bo’s wife Gu . Kailai last November. The Bo scandal has overshadowed the handover of power and exposed infighting and horse trading among hard-liners and reformers. At the congress, Mr Hu promised political reform – but he ruled out copying Western-style democracy. He also said army generals must . transform ‘China into a maritime power’ to ensure it could ‘win a local . war in the information age’ to defend its territorial claims in the . resource-rich seas off its coast. Mr Hu’s successor Xi Jinping will be unveiled next week and will officially take over in March. The all-male Standing Committee, . consisting of seven to nine politicians, will also be revealed. Chosen . behind closed doors, the committee is the apex of power in the country. Speech: Mr Hu called for an end to corruption in order for government to gain the trust of the Chinese people . Screen on the green: School students sit outside to watch Mr Hu delivering his keynote report . High spirits: Chinese hostesses jump before the opening session outside the Great Hall of the People in Beijing . Heavy security has surrounded the party congress which is in effect a rubber-stamp process and a show of unity and power . Scores of dissidents have been hauled away by security agents or placed under house arrest. Delegates filed into Beijing's Great . Hall of the People, bedecked with red banners, and the congress was . declared open after the national anthem played. The 2,268 delegates are drawn from . the 82million-member party where the real deal-making is done by a few . dozen power-brokers behind the scenes, even as China is ever more . connected to the world through trade and the Internet. In a speech aimed at outlining the successes of the past five years and challenges for the future, Mr . Hu said: 'We are faced with unprecedented opportunities for . developments as well as risks. The party must keep in mind the trust of . the people. 'The fight against corruption remains a serious challenge for us.' Coming so soon after President Barack . Obama's re-election in the U.S., the congress has drawn unfavourable . comparisons from politically minded Chinese who have bemoaned how little . direct influence they have in choosing their leaders. Grand design: Delegates listen as Mr Hu (unseen) delivers his address . Rush hour: People at Beijing Railway Station walk past a giant TV screen broadcasting the opening session . Momentous day: Paramilitary policemen salute as the national flag is raised at sunrise on Tiananmen Square . 'I am doing nothing but staring at . the television before Obama gets re-elected. As for China's party . congress, there is no need for me to worry. On the contrary, it would be . a waste of my time,' Xu Xiaoping, a celebrity entrepreneur who . co-founded a successful chain of English language cram schools, said on a . Chinese version of Twitter where he has six million followers. To . many Chinese, China is at an inflection point. Its old model of heavily . state-directed growth that lifted hundreds of millions out of poverty . and made China an economic powerhouse is sputtering in the face of . rising domestic debt and a weak global economy. Meanwhile, the government has to contend with the public's continued expectations of higher living standards and for less corruption and greater accountability, if not outright democracy. In Tiananmen Square, adjacent to the congress venue, a woman in her 30s threw pieces of torn paper into the air and shouted 'bandits and robbers!' in the early morning before she was taken away by security forces. On the eve of the congress, four ethnic Tibetans in Sichuan province set themselves on fire in protests against Chinese rule of Tibetan areas, London-based rights group Free Tibet said, adding that the timing of the protests appeared aimed at sending a signal to the Chinese leadership.","Ruling Communist Party today opened congress to usher in new group of younger leaders faced with challenging task of righting flagging economy .

"By . Mike Dawes and Thomas Durante . PUBLISHED: . 09:13 EST, 12 November 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 04:07 EST, 13 November 2012 . Lance Armstrong has posted a picture on Twitter of himself relaxing surrounded by his tainted Tour de France yellow jerseys in what is seen as a provocative gesture toward his opponents, but it appears the internet may have the last laugh. The Texas cyclist was stripped of the seven titles last month after the U.S. Anti-doping Agency (USADA) found that he had used performance-enhancing drugs during his record-breaking Tour de France run. But Armstrong is clearly not letting it get to him, as he posted a panoramic photo on Twitter of him lounging in his home - surrounded by the one thing the USADA can't take away from him - with the caption 'Back in Austin and just layin' around...' Cheek: Lance Armstrong posted a picture of himself lying down surrounded by his yellow jerseys . Meme: It wasn't long before internet jokesters took Armstrong to task over the Twitter image . The jerseys are hanging in frames on the walls near the L-shaped sofa, each spotlighted by an individual lightbulb, with a pair of curtains left open to clearly display the last of them. Last month, the International Cycling Union (UCI) ratified the sanctions recommended by USADA, who concluded Armstrong and his U.S. Postal team ran 'the most sophisticated, professionalized and successful doping program that sport has ever seen.' All Armstrong's results from August 1, 1998 were expunged from the record books, including his seven consecutive Tour de France 'wins' from 1999 to 2005, and the 41-year-old was banned from cycling for life. It wasn't long before internet jokesters took Armstrong to task over the image - as he was mocked in hilarious memes based on the photo. Last week, the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) also announced last week that it would not appeal the sanctions, while the International Olympic Committee has opened an investigation which could see Armstrong stripped of his road time-trial bronze medal from the 2000 Games in Sydney. Admirers? Another Twitter user took the image of Armstrong and added other famous cheaters . Disgrace: All Armstrong's results from August 1, 1998 were expunged from the record books, including his seven consecutive Tour de France 'wins' from 1999 to 2005, and the 41-year-old was banned from cycling for life . Armstrong did not cooperate with the USADA investigation and has consistently denied wrongdoing. The doping allegations brought critics out of the woodwork, who blasted the cyclist as a cheater who shamed the sport. Betsy Andreu, the wife of Armstrong's former teammate Frankie Andreu went so far as to call Armstrong the 'Bernie Madoff' of sport, telling NBC's Rock Center that he played the world and the media like a fiddle for years while knowingly taking performance-enhancing drugs. She said: 'Bernie Madoff was one of the biggest frauds in the history of the world, in the history of finance maybe? Lance is the biggest fraud in the history of sport,' she told the TV station. Playing dirty: Dutch soccer bad boy Mark van Bommel and his yellow cards were also in on the Lance Armstrong fun . Shamed: The doping allegations brought critics of Armstrong out of the woodwork, who blasted the cyclist as a cheater who brought shame to the sport . Passive aggressive: Though he has since removed the line '7-time Tour de France champion' from his Twitter profile, the picture is sure to be seen as provocative gesture . Last week, Armstrong also cut formal ties with his cancer-fighting charity to avoid further damage brought by doping charges and the removal of the Tour titles. Armstrong resigned from the board of directors for Livestrong on November 4 after he had previously quit as chairman of the charity on October 17. Though he has since removed the line '7-time Tour de France champion' from his Twitter profile, the photo posted over the weekend is sure to be seen as provocative gesture. The fall-out from the USADA's verdict has been extensive, with 11 of Armstrong's former team-mates receiving six-month bans after admitting their own doping offences in the course of their testimonies against him. South African mountain-biker David George, who rode with U.S. Postal from 1999 to 2000, was provisionally suspended on Tuesday after testing positive for the banned blood-booster EPO.","Armstrong was stripped of his seven Tour de France titles last month after an investigation by the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency .

"By . Jason Groves . PUBLISHED: . 20:37 EST, 8 November 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 20:34 EST, 9 November 2012 . A furious debate erupted over Press regulation yesterday after more than 40 Tories called on David Cameron to consider passing laws to police the media. In a letter to the Guardian, senior figures including former foreign secretary Sir Malcolm Rifkind and two former party chairmen, Caroline Spelman and Lord Fowler, said proposals for a tough system of self-regulation did not go far enough. They claimed that statutory regulation of broadcasters had not prevented TV channels from running investigative journalism and exposing wrongdoing. Tory MPs have told David Cameron not to rule out the possibility of statutory Press regulation . And they suggested the Prime Minister . should keep open the door to some form of state regulation when Lord . Justice Leveson publishes the findings of his inquiry into Press ethics . later this month. They also called for a single standard to assess public interest, which could be ‘applied independently and consistently’. Several of the signatories have faced embarrassing Press scrutiny into . their conduct in the past and their intervention provoked a backlash . from other MPs who described their views as ‘disappointing and . misguided’. John Whittingdale, chairman of the Commons culture, media and sport . committee, said: ‘I would have thought most Conservatives would be very . wary of any government legislative involvement in the regulation of the . Press. ‘I am opposed to any kind of statutory regulation of the Press, including statutory underpinning. ‘While I understand the strength of feeling that some action needs to be . taken, given the behaviour by sections of the Press has been so bad, I . think the new regulatory system proposed by the industry, which includes . new powers that were not there before, deserves to be given a chance.’ MPs including Boris Johnson, right, have called upon David Cameron not to rule out Press regulation if it is recommended by Lord Leveson, left, in his forthcoming report on Press standards . Philip Davies, a Tory member of the culture committee, said: ‘They are . trying to have it both ways and you can’t. It’s like pregnancy – you . can’t be a bit pregnant and you can’t have partial state interference. You either have a free Press or you don’t.’ Several senior Cabinet ministers including Education Secretary Michael . Gove, Communities Secretary Eric Pickles and Chancellor George Osborne . are also opposed to state regulation of any kind. Mr Cameron is thought . to be reluctant to involve the state in Press regulation, but is under . pressure to accept Lord Leveson’s recommendations, which are expected to . call for at least statutory ‘underpinning’ for a new regulator. Lord Black, chairman of the funding body for the Press Complaints . Commission, told the Leveson Inquiry he wanted a form of ‘muscular’ self-regulation. That would mean a new organisation with the power to . launch investigations and levy fines of up to £1million. A letter from 42 MPs including Michael Gove, left, and Eric Pickles, right, warns that a new system being proposed by the newspaper industry ‘risks being an unstable model destined to fail’ Yesterday’s letter calling for a ‘genuinely independent system’ was . co-ordinated by Mr Cameron’s former Press secretary George Eustice and . fellow Tory MP Nadhim Zahawi. Mr Zahawi told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme he was ‘instinctively . opposed’ to statutory Press regulation but had changed his mind after . hearing evidence of Press abuses. He said a new regulator would not have to be ‘invasive’, and cited the Advertising Standards Authority as a possible model. Fraser Nelson, editor of the Spectator magazine, said the prospect of regulation was already having an insidious effect. ‘I, as an editor, am getting MPs and ministers calling me up to order . that I discipline writers who displease them or take articles down in a . way that they wouldn’t have even a year ago because the feeling is going . around amongst politicians that, finally, they are going to get their . say in how the Press should behave. By Michael Seamark . Injunction: Caroline Spelman . Caroline Spelman is one of several of the newspaper letter’s signatories to have crossed swords with the Press. During the 2009 expenses scandal, it emerged she claimed £40,000 for cleaning and bills at her £2million, 15-bedroom Georgian mansion near Solihull. The Tory politician was also forced to apologise and pay back £9,600 of allowances she ‘inadvertently’ misused to pay her children’s nanny. MPs on the Commons standards and privileges committee said that in 1997 and 1998 – when her son Jonny was three – she overpaid her nanny £4,800 a year in return for secretarial work, meaning her childcare was ‘cross-subsidised’. Her appointment in 2010 as Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Secretary prompted questions about her impartiality and apparent willingness to put the interests of business and farmers above those of the consumer. Her background was as an agricultural scientist and in the early 1980s she was sugar beet commodity secretary for the National Farmers’ Union, which supports both GM and clone animals. In 1989, she and her husband Marc set up a lobbying firm to promote the food and biotech industries. Following her appointment as Secretary of State in 2010, she revealed she supported the introduction of GM crops ‘under the right circumstances’. This sparked a Mail investigation into the Spelmans’ links to the lobby industry. She maintained there was no conflict of interest. In March she lost a High Court bid to hush up revelations that her rugby-playing son Jonny took banned steroids. The MP spent over £60,000 on legal fees after obtaining a gagging order preventing reporting of the drug-taking. But Mrs Spelman abandoned her controversial injunction after a judge ruled in favour of the public’s right to know. Last December, Zac Goldsmith, another Tory MP to sign the Guardian letter, compared tabloids to the Nazi death camp at Auschwitz when he gave evidence to a parliamentary committee on privacy. Sitting alongside actors Hugh Grant and Steve Coogan, the MP rejected arguments that newspapers should be given free rein to print stories about the private lives of the famous so that they can remain financially viable. The multi-millionaire said: ‘If the only way a business can stay afloat is by engaging in immoral or unethical behaviour, then that business should either change its model or go out of business. ‘No one said that Auschwitz should have been kept open because it created jobs.’ The MP was appearing before the committee because he had previously obtained a so-called super-injunction preventing the publication of private emails which had been leaked to the Press. In 2006, Tory MP Mark Field, who signed the letter, was revealed to have had a brief affair with one of the party’s A-list candidates, Liz Truss. The relationship began when Miss Truss, who is now an MP, worked for the married Mr Field. Bob Stewart, a fourth Tory signatory, caused a scandal in 1993 when he left his wife for Claire Podbielski. He met the aid worker when he was colonel commanding British UN troops in Bosnia. They later married but the affair blighted his military prospects. Mr Stewart was not dismissed but his career was effectively ended by senior officers’ disapproval.","A letter from 42 MPs and two peers warns that a new system being proposed by the newspaper industry 'risks being an unstable model destined to fail'

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 09:13 EST, 6 November 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 12:37 EST, 7 November 2012 . House prices will not return to their pre-crisis peak until 2019, making this the longest fall in the housing market since records began, a report says today. It predicts that prices will drop in every region next year, with Wales and Scotland among the worst hit. The report, from the estate agency Knight Frank, says prices peaked at an average of £183,959 in 2007 but have fallen so dramatically that they will not return to this level until 2019 at the earliest. On the slide: House prices have been falling for two years and are heading back towards the 2009 lows . This 12-year recovery period is the longest since records began in the 1950s. The report says the recovery is even further away if inflation is taken into account. If the increases in the cost of living are also considered, the date slips back to 2031. During the last housing market fall, prices peaked in 1989 at £62,782 and did not reach that level again until 1998. In a report yesterday, Halifax, the country’s biggest mortgage lender, said prices have dropped for each of the last four months and were down 0.7 per cent last month. The average home now costs £158,426. Another report, from the National Association of Estate Agents, says  the number of properties that are available to buy has plunged since the recession. Martin Ellis, Halifax’s housing economist, said: ‘Signs of a modest deterioration in the trend in house prices continued in October. Prices in the three months to October were 1.2 per cent lower than in the preceding three months. ‘The weak economic background has been a key factor dampening housing demand this year. Recent encouraging developments relating to the level of overall economic activity and conditions in the labour market, however, may help to support demand and underpin house prices around current levels over the coming months.’ Drifting down: A stagnant property market has seen house prices gently slide lower after the brief recovery in late 2009 and early 2010 . The downbeat Halifax update echoes a report by property listing website RightMove that claimed nearly a fifth of homeowners who bought their property in the last five years are now saddled with negative equity. It said that 17 per cent of people who purchased a home since 2007 have a mortgage balance bigger than the value of their home. The most recent Land Registry figures, which are based on transactions, recorded house prices in England and Wales up 1.1 per cent to an average of £162,561 in the year to September. However, this continues to be skewed by London prices, which were up 5.5 per cent annually – more than twice as fast as the next highest rise of 2.3 per cent seen in the South East. Property prices rose in four of the regions surveyed and fell in the other six. Takes time: Peter Rollings, CEO of London estate agent Marsh and Parsons, says it will be some time before the overall national property market returns to health . Peter Rollings, CEO of upmarket London . estate agent Marsh and Parsons, said that it will be some time before . the overall national property market returns to health. He said: 'Halifax’s figures portray a . downbeat performance from house prices in recent months, and reflect the . troubled state of the national housing market. 'Buyers’ spending power is still squeezed, with wage inflation still lagging behind the growing cost of living, and while there are signs that mortgage lending is beginning to head in the right direction, it will be quite some time before it returns to the level needed for significant improvement in the number of buyers able to move home each month. 'The tale is very different in London. While house price growth has been steadying in recent months, prime areas in the capital are still seeing double digit annual growth as a result of the demand from wealthier equity rich buyers, and this is helping support the average national house price.'","The average home dipped by 0.7 per cent in value .

A private company is raking in cash by fining more than 100 people a day for dropping litter, according to a report. Members of the public are being treated as ‘cash cows’ by over-zealous litter patrols who work for a firm that has signed lucrative commission-only contracts with councils, say critics. At least 12 local authorities have employed one business, Xfor, to issue on-the-spot fines. It keeps at least £35 from each £75 penalty notice its staff hand out. Littering: A private company is making money out of fining more than 100 people a day for dropping litter . So far, the firm has issued 43,478 fines under the payment-for-penalties deal – equivalent to 750 a week, according to a report. Freedom of Information requests show that the company, run by ex-Armed Forces personnel, has pocketed £1.6million of the money it has raised from tickets handed out by 51 members of staff. Critics have accused the councils and the firm of ‘profiteering’ by ruthlessly pursuing anyone suspected of dropping rubbish. One woman in Blaenau Gwent, South Wales, was fined by Xfor for dropping a thread from her glove accidentally. Another was fined for walking her dog in a field she had used for 30 years, unaware it had been turned into a no-dog zone. In Hillingdon, West London, people have been fined for dropping nut shells or orange peel, which rots away. In one case in South Wales, a woman was fined for walking her dog in a field unaware it had been turned into a no-dog zone (stock image) The details are contained in a report . which shows that across the country, town hall enforcement officers and . councils that hire private companies issued a total of 73,536 penalties . last year, equivalent to 200 a day. Of that total, 63,883 were issued in . England – up from 727 in 1997. The . huge rise comes after the introduction of the Neighbourhoods and . Environment Act 2005, which allowed local authorities to retain funds . raised by fines. Community Secretary Eric Pickles said councils should not use residents as cash cows . The report, published by the Manifesto Club think-tank, estimates that councils raked in £5.5million last year. Entitled The Corruption Of Punishment: How Litter Fines Became A Business, it shows that the largest number of litter fines handed out in one area last year was in Newham, East London, which earned the council £664,875. Josie Appleton, of the libertarian group, said: ‘It is a booming business. The fines are not being issued in the public interest, but as a money-making operation for cash-strapped public authorities and their growing army of contractors. ‘People are being fined not for the most serious offences but for the most trivial, which are easy to catch. Several members of the public have been fined for dropping things by accident, or which they were in the process of picking up. ‘Many councils are spending more time investigating and prosecuting people for cigarette butts than for fly-tipping.’ Tory MP Dominic Raab said: ‘The exponential rise in spot fines for petty offences, and the payment of commission to litter police, means more jobsworth officials and increasing numbers of decent citizens being treated like a revenue cash cow.’ Communities Secretary Eric Pickles said: ‘Those who shamelessly litter and fly-tip should be brought to book. But councils shouldn’t be using residents as cash cows.’ Xfor did not respond to requests for comment last night.","Xfor keeps at least £35 from each £75 penalty handed out .

Jailed: Tang Ge, 38, of Irlam, Greater Manchester, had met the woman after putting an advert on an online community forum asking for domestic help . A ‘conniving and dangerous’ Home Office interpreter has been jailed for nine years after drugging a 24-year-old college student and raping her at her home while she was asleep. Tang Ge, 38, of Irlam, Greater Manchester, had met the unidentified woman after putting an advert on an online community forum looking for someone to do domestic chores, police said. She took a coffee from him not realising he had secretly slipped a sleeping pill into it, before he clinked his cup against hers and told her: ‘drink your coffee, it’s getting cold’ and ‘bottoms up’. The woman began to feel faint before Ge slipped tablets into a glass of water. He was heard stirring it with a spoon before he suggested she drink that too, Manchester Crown Court was told. The student woke up in bed 10 hours later with some of her clothing removed but no memory of what happened. Tests revealed she was raped. Ge - who translated Mandarin at police stations, detention centres and courts - was today starting a nine-year prison term after being convicted of rape and perverting the course of justice. The incident occurred in September 2009 after Ge - also known as 'Tony' - had befriended the foreign student via the advert he placed a few weeks before, Manchester Crown Court heard. Ge turned up at her home at lunchtime and asked if he could come in to eat some food he had bought from a cafe. She let him in and was given the takeaway coffee he had also just bought. Hearing: The incident occurred in September 2009, Manchester Crown Court (pictured) was told . The woman started to feel dizzy so Ge went to get her a glass of water. She heard the sound of him stirring the glass and when he returned she saw that it was cloudy. Mugshot: Ge used to translate Mandarin at police stations, detention centres and courts . She pretended to drink the water before hiding it, but then passed out. She later woke up and called police. Forensic officers arrived and recovered items including the glass of water. Two days later Ge was arrested and interviewed.  Forensic analysis of the victim’s blood revealed traces of Temazepam and Oxazepam, both of which are sedatives. The cloudy liquid in the glass from the victim’s home was found to contain Temazepam. Forensic tests also confirmed Ge had raped her. In February 2012, Ge stood trial but a jury failed to reach a verdict after he insisted the woman was lying. Police probed some of his defence evidence and discovered it had been deliberately falsified. His medical records revealed that he had been prescribed the sedatives used in the attack. He was convicted following a retrial. Detective Constable Dave Ogden of Greater Manchester Police said today: ‘Once Ge had gained the confidence and trust of the victim he wormed his way into her flat where he drugged and raped her. ‘The victim only started to piece together her awful ordeal when she regained consciousness some nine or 10 hours later. I cannot even begin to imagine the horror she experienced when she realised that she had been raped by Ge. ‘To make matters worse he has failed to acknowledge what he has done throughout, trying to make the victim out to be a liar and forcing her to sit through two trials. ‘I am pleased he has been exposed as the conniving and dangerous sex offender he is and I hope the victim can feel some sense of justice now he has been jailed.’","Tang Ge, 38, of Irlam, Greater .

But yesterday Mr Dimbleby told the Mail this was not the case. He said he would not be allowed to run the BBC anyway because, at 74, he was above the age limit. Asked . if his interview on Today was a thinly-veiled job application, he said: . ‘It wasn’t. I’m over the age barrier, simple as that. I can’t do it . because of my age. That’s the rules.’ Mr . Dimbleby described the BBC as the ‘greatest broadcasting organisation . in the world’ but added: ‘What it has is a crisis of management of its . own making.’ Attack: Mr Dimbleby said that George Entwistle lacked the 'stomach' needed for the job and Lord Patten should consider why he hired him in the first place . He said ‘committed’ staff who serve the public faithfully have been ‘betrayed by the management’. The . TV presenter compared the bureaucracy of the BBC with that of the NHS, . saying they both are guilty of ‘managers adding to management’ and . reducing the actual service. Mr . Dimbleby added: ‘In my opinion it is still over-managed and the . management still speak gobbledegook.......It’s gone bonkers at that . level.’ But said it was ‘hyperbole’  to describe the situation as the worst crisis in the BBC’s history. Mr Dimbleby added he believed George . Entwistle had been given a huge £450,000 pay-off to get rid of him and . that BBC Trust chairman Lord Patten should 'reflect' on why he chose . Entwistle in the first place. The BBC's biggest-ever internal crisis is entirely 'of its own making', he said. The . presenter, who has been with the BBC for 50 years, has applied for the . director general job in the past and his outburst has led to speculation . he will take another run at it after Entwistle resigned after just 54 . days in charge. He . pointed out that George Entwistle's previous title before his abortive . stint as DG had been head of 'vision' rather than head of television. The presenter said the existing culture did not produce 'good director-generals'. 'You . get people who have played the game very carefully, one against the . other... they just don't have the stomach for what is needed,' he said. Angry: John Simpson also blamed 'over-management' at the BBC that started thirty years ago . Dimbleby . said it would be 'absurd' for BBC Trust chairman Lord Patten to resign . over the controversy. But he added: 'I think he should reflect on why he . chose George.' Writing in the Daily Telegraph, . Dimbleby suggested the nature of Mr Entwistle's departure demonstrated . that he was not right for the job. 'The . fact that he chose to resign rather than fight shows that he was not . the right choice for Director-General. The DG has to fight like a tiger . to defend the BBC and George did not do that,' he added. The trouble is that the BBC in recent years has throttled itself with its own bureaucracy - which saps the energy of its staff and demoralises them. 'It is over-managed and badly managed so that no-one knows how or where decisions are taken. 'The upshot is a crazy system where George as head of television, when told of the Savile suspicions, ends up saying that he does not want to show 'undue interest' in something that clearly radically affects his programming.' Meanwhile veteran correspondent John Simpson says the BBC can salvage its damaged reputation but also blamed 'over-management' for some of its ills. 'It may look good if more senior people resign, but the only effect it will have will be to make the people who take their place more timid. If it happens, it will be a cop-out. What is required is a change in the way News and Current Affairs, and perhaps other parts of the BBC, are controlled,' he said. 'Over-management has been a serious blight on the BBC since the Eighties. The proliferation of middle managers in the BBC was something that Lord Patten wanted to deal with; but the decisions about who should be sacked were all too often made by middle managers. In spite of everyone’s best intentions, the real weight of the savage cuts that have been imposed on the BBC since the licence-fee agreement of 2010 has fallen on the programme-makers and broadcasters. 'In the past Newsnight would never have thought of contracting out something as important as the investigation of a child-molestation scandal to an independent company; it would have been done in-house, by people who adhered to the BBC’s own standards.'","The Question Time presenter says it cannot produce good director generals with the 'stomach' for a fight .
Dimbleby could be a candidate to be next director general and says BBC is suffering its biggest ever internal crisis - 'of its own making'
'It has gone bonkers' Mr Dimbleby said, adding Lord Patten should: 'reflect on why he chose George (Entwistle)'
John Simpson says the BBC can salvage its reputation but they must crush 'blight' of 'over-management'"

TV presenter Anna Ryder Richardson wept into her husband's chest today after he admitted serious health and safety breaches which put a mother and her young child in hospital. The celebrity interior designer refused to leave his side after she was cleared of identical charges and sobbed uncontrollably as he handed her a tissue to comfort her saying: 'It is alright, it is OK.' Ryder Richardson, 48, was due to stand trial this morning at Swansea Crown Court with husband Colin MacDougall, 46. TV presenter Anna Ryder Richardson arrived with her husband at Swansea Crown Court today to face trial on health and safety charges after a toddler and his mum were crushed by a falling tree at her zoo . Both had previously denied the charges against them and were ready to deny the accusations over the trial's scheduled three weeks. The couple was charged with Health and Safety breaches after Emma Davies-Hughes, 30, and her three-year-old son Gruff were crushed by a tree. The mother and son, from Llanelli, were among dozens of people visiting the wallaby enclosure at the time. Gruff Davies-Hughes was left fighting for his life after a falling branch hit him on the head and had to spend three days in intensive care. His mother suffered injuries to her head, leg, pelvis, and arm in the Manor House Animal Park owned by the couple. A mother and her three-month-old son were injured by a falling branch at Anna Ryder Richardson's Manor House Wildlife Park in Pembrokeshire, West Wales . The celebrity interior designer wept uncontrollably into her husband's chest after he admitted serious health and safety breaches . But a court heard that MacDougall was 'more responsible' for the safety and upkeep of the hundreds of trees at the zoo in Pembrokeshire, West Wales. Prosecutor David Morgan said: 'A three-year-old boy and his mother were injured as a consequence of a tree falling. Injured: Emma Davies-Hughes and her three-year-old son were both injured by a falling branch at Manor House animal park . 'There is evidence to link a breach of health and safety laws with that incident. It is unclear whether a proper regime would have prevented it. Ryder Richardson denied breaching the Health and Safety at Work Act 1974 but her husband pleaded guilty to four charges - two in his own name and two in the company Manor House Wildlife Ltd. Ben Compton, defending Ryder Richardson, said: 'There is no evidence at all to link her with any form of tree management at this wildlife park. 'It has been a long two years for her. You will see the effect on her in the dock.' David Morgan said: 'Anna Ryder Richardson’s day-to-day involvement with this part of the company was far less significant than MacDougall’s'. He told the judge, following today's . guilty pleas, there was careful consideration before the charges against . Ryder Richardson were withdrawn. He said it had been clear that she had little to do with the aspect of the company for which her husband was responsible. Christian Du Cann, defending MacDougall, said: 'It has been a difficult year for them.' When the two charges against Ryder Richardson . were withdrawn, she was told she could leave the dock while discussions . about sentencing her husband continued. But she clung to her husband's arm and, in tears, asked: 'Can I stay?' She was allowed to do so by the judge. Sentence on MacDougall was adjourned at Swansea Crown Court until later in the month. The couple, who married in 2005, have daughters Bibi-Belle, ten, and Dixie-Dot, nine. They were both at their 52-acre Manor House in Tenby, Pembrokeshire, when the accident happened in August 2010. Scottish-born MacDougall was released on bail to await sentence. The admission of guilt today potentially leaves the way open for a civil claim for damages from the injured pair.

Jailed: Jamie Ramage was sent to prison for six years for having sex with two underage girls and grooming a third . A man who used Facebook to prey on underage girls for sex has been jailed for six years. Jamie Ramage, 20, tricked two teens into having unprotected sex with him after sending them messages on the social networking site. He was working on meeting a third girl in a hotel when her mother found his lewd messages and contacted police - but not before the girl had sent him naked photographs of herself. Ramage, of Whinside, Stanley, County Durham, had already been found guilty by a jury of one offence of having unlawful sex with a child and was on bail when he committed the other offences. At Durham Crown Court Dan Cordey, prosecuting, said Ramage used Facebook to contact impressionable young girls. He persuaded his first victim, from the Newcastle area, to visit him at Stanley and they had sex at a friend’s house. The second girl also visited him in Stanley and they had sex in a local park. Judge Penny Moreland said Ramage 'manipulated, bullied and emotionally blackmailed' the underage girls into having sex with him and told them their age 'was just a number'. Mr Cordey said Ramage told the third girl, from South Yorkshire, he had received a commission from a record company to write music and the cash would pay for a hotel for the pair of them. He said the pair exchanged hundreds of messages, including lewd photographs, in the 10 days before the girl’s mother came across some of the messages, questioned her daughter and contacted police. Judge Moreland told him an 'aggravating factor' in his offending was that he had unprotected sex with his first two victims. Julie Clemitson, representing Ramage, said her client was immature and targeted young girls because 'only girls of that age would fall for the rubbish which comes from his mouth'. Defence: Durham Crown Court heard how he chose young girls because they were more impressionable . The judge told Ramage she believed he posed a 'serious risk' to young girls and said: 'You displayed predatory behaviour to identify girls to fall prey to you.' Judge Moreland jailed him on November 9 for four years for each of the two counts of having sex with an under-age girl, the sentences to run concurrently, but added two years on to those for the offence of grooming the third. She ordered he be placed under supervision for a further six years, meaning he will be supervised until he is 32 years old. Ramage was also placed on the sex offenders register for life.","He was grooming a third girl when her mother spotted the messages and told police .

Ugly and misshapen fruit and vegetables could make a return to supermarket shelves after the summer floods hit this year’s harvest. Farmers and ministers are urging supermarkets to stop throwing away thousands of tonnes of perfectly edible food just because of the way it looks. It means shoppers could be loading their baskets with rude shaped vegetables which used to dominate TV shows like That’s Life. Knobbly carrots and mis-shapen apples could be back on supermarket shelves as farmers struggle to cope with the impact of the wet summer . Farming minister David Heath said: ‘Ugly veg is still tasty veg, and there is absolutely no reason it should not be sold. We need to bear down on waste at all points in the food chain.’ The government’s Love Food Hate Waste campaign is now working with retailers to cut the amount of edible food which is thrown away. UK supermarkets set much higher standards for the way food looks than is required by the European Union, the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said. ‘Due to the difficult weather conditions across Northern Europe this year, many retailers are working with farmers to market fruit and vegetables which are less cosmetically perfect but still healthy and sound.’ This could mean allowing products which are ‘larger/smaller, shorter/rounder or storm marked’. Shoppers will be told that while these products ‘may not look as pretty but taste just as good and are good for you’. The return of mis-shapen food raises the prospect of amusing additions to shopping baskets. This tomato became an internet hit after keen gardeners Eric and Diane Hinchliffe from Lincolnshire noticed it looked like a rubber duck and the pig-shaped carrot belonged to Ann Miller of Seaford . EU marketing standards set out the specific size and shape for the 10 most consumed products including apples, pears, strawberries, citrus, table grapes, peaches, kiwifruit, lettuces tomatoes and sweet peppers. Tory MP Laura Sandys, who set up a campaign called Ugly Food, said rising food prices and the impact of floods on harvests means shoppers will be forced to lowers their standards. ‘The idea that you look on an apple or a banana as beautiful could now finally be over. You wonder if we have also taken some of the taste out of our fruit and veg as a result of the pursuit of aesthetically beautiful food. ‘We cannot afford to be doing this these days. I hope that what is happening now is supermarkets are taking this lower standard food.’ Campaigners argue that food which had grown oddly will still taste good . Farmers have warned of rising food prices as a result of the summer’s floods. An NFU spokesman said: ‘The wet weather over the summer was far from ideal and certainly presented a huge challenge for many of our growers. ‘We would urge retailers to apply a sensible level of flexibility on their product specifications to ensure that as much of the British crop that is available makes its way onto the supermarket shelves for consumers to enjoy.’ Last month a survey by the National Farmers’ Union showed wheat yields had fallen by 14.1 per cent this year, after England and Wales suffered the wettest summer for 100 years. In the North West farmers warned they could lose hundreds of thousands of pounds and face financial ruin.","The wettest summer for 100 years left many crops rotting in fields .

A farmer whose land was littered with rotting animal carcasses has been banned from keeping dogs for ten years, after his collies were found feeding on decomposing remains. Leon Henry Smith, 62, had twice before been banned from keeping sheep or cattle due to the appalling conditions on his farm near Okehampton, Devon. Animal welfare officers found the 13 sheepdogs feeding on a rotting pig carcass in squalid conditions in 2011, but he was given the chance to improve conditions for the dogs after the judge at Exeter Crown Court deferred sentencing. Squalid: Animal welfare inspectors found the collie dogs caked in mud and fighting over a dead pig (circled) However, Smith's case was brought back to court after Devon County Council’s Trading Standards Team and DEFRA veterinary officers found fresh evidence of neglect. Regular visits by animal welfare . officers, under the instruction of the court, had shown no significant . improvements being made to the standard of the dogs' care. Officers . advised Smith to provide fresh water, clean up their enclosure and . concrete the area to provide a suitable dry environment, but the court . heard they continued to be housed in appalling conditions in . rubbish-strewn and muddy makeshift kennels with little protection from . the weather. Inhumane: The shivering dogs were feeding on rotting pig carcasses when animal welfare officials found them . Last chance: The court had deferred sentencing to allow owner Leon Smith to improve conditions for the dogs . One dog was suffering with a skin condition which Smith refused refer to a vet. Police also discovered three dogs confined overnight in a parked van with a sheep carcass crawling with maggots. Two were locked in cramped cages without food or water. Councillor Roger Croad, Devon County Council Cabinet Member for Communities, said: 'The court gave Mr Smith the opportunity to demonstrate that he could comply with the requirements of animal welfare legislation and achieve the necessary standards of care. 'Despite being advised by our Trading Standards Officers and local vets on how to achieve this, he has failed to do so. 'The conditions his animals were kept in fall well below acceptable welfare standards, and Mr Smith’s failure to address this left us no alternative but to bring this case back to court. 'Banning him from keeping dogs for the next ten years sends a clear message to those who do not meet basic animal welfare needs, and we will continue to take all necessary action to ensure that these acceptable standards of animal care are met.' Fresh evidence: Officers later found dogs in cramped cages in the back of a van without food or water . The Council’s Trading Standards Team launched their initial investigation into Smith in February 2011. Visiting his land at Meldon they found his dogs feeding on the body of a dead pig that had been left in their enclosure, while more pig carcases were found among piles of rubbish and broken machinery. Several other carcasses were subsequently found at the site, including the remains of a dead sheep in a horse box. Serial neglect: Smith had been banned from keeping sheep or cattle on two previous occasions . Livestock carcasses are legally required to be disposed of in an approved and safe manner to prevent the spread of disease to animals and humans. Appearing at Exeter Crown Court in May, Smith pleaded guilty to two charges under the Animal Welfare Act 2006 and six charges under the Animal By-Products (England) Regulations 2005. At another hearing on November 9 he also pleaded guilty to two further animal by-products offences, relating to sheep and other carcass remains found on his land at Meldon during an inspection on 19 April 2012. These, along with the judges concerns about Smith’s general disregard to the welfare of animals, were taken into consideration in sentencing. He was banned for ten years from keeping dogs and ordered to pay an £800 fine and £500 in costs.","Collies discovered feeding on rotting pig carcass in February 2011 .

The U.S. may be buckling under a deepening economic crisis but art lovers are set to splash hundreds of millions of dollars on collectable works over two weeks in New York. The November auction season started at Christie's on Wednesday in Manhattan with one of Monet's most famous paintings being sold for $44million (£25.5million) while a Kandinsky fetched an artist's record of $23million (£15million) – but it was not all good news as many works were left unsold. French impressionist Monet's iconic water lilies paintings, 'Nympheas' which was painted in the early 1900s while the impressionist was living in Giverny in northern France reached the middle of its estimate and was one of the most high profile pieces that went under the hammer at Christie's. Scroll down for video of the legendary paintings . Sold: 'Nympheas' by Claude Monet sold at Christie's for $44million in New York . Meanwhile, Wassily Kandinsky's ‘Studie . fur Improvisation 8,’ reached the the low end of its $20million-$30million (£12.5million - . £18.8million) estimate, and set a new auction record for the Russian . artist. The vibrant work was being sold by Switzerland's Volkart . Foundation. But the sales were not a complete success with 30 per cent of the 69 works on offer failing to sell or reach their reserve price. In total the auction took in a total of just under $205million (£128.6million), missing the low pre-sale estimate of about $210.7million (£131.8million). But the auction house said it was pleased with the results. Brooke Lampley, head of Impressionist and modern art at Christie’s said: ‘It was very, very strong sale, with great results. ‘Classic Impressionism performed really well tonight.’ Record sale: Studie fur Improvisation 8 by Wassily Kandinsky reached $23m at auction . Officials privately attributed the relatively high percentage of works that failed to sell - nearly one third - chiefly to a single collection whose owner was unwilling to lower the reserve prices in the days leading up to the sale. In all, six lots sold for more than $10million (£6.2million) each. Other highlights included Miro's 'Peinture (Femme, Journal, Chien), which went for $13.75million (£8.6 million), and Picasso's ‘Buste de femme,’ and oil on canvas that at $13.1million (£8.2million) was one of the few works to beat its pre-sale estimate comfortably. Proceeds from the Monet sale will benefit a private prep school in Tarrytown, New York, which received the work in a bequest. High expectations: Nature morte aux tulips by Pablo Picasso is expected to command a lot of attention . Up for sale: Andy Warhol's painting of the Statue of Liberty is up for auction in New York . On Thursday, the world’s richest collectors will head two miles north-east across Manhattan to Sotheby’s Impressionist and modern art sale. More than 60 lots there include nine works by Picasso, led by paintings of his lover Marie-Therese Walter. Nature morte aux tulipes carries an estimate of up to $50million (£31.4million) while Femme a la Fenetre could fetch up to $20million (£12.5million). It has been suggested that the . economic downturn is pushing investors, including increasingly wealthy . new buyers from Russia and China, towards canvas rather than stocks. Iconic: The Screaming Pope painting by Francis Bacon . Going under the hammer: No 1 (Royal Red and Blue) by Mark Rothko . The New York auctions move on next week to sales of contemporary and post-war art with equally eye-watering estimates. Rothko's No1 (Royal Red and Blue) could fetch $50million (£31.4million) at Sotheby’s, while one of Francis Bacon’s ‘screaming pope’ paintings should sell for up to $25million (£15.7million). Christie’s, meanwhile, is pinning its hopes on Andy Warhol’s Statue of Liberty, a 3D work expected to go for more than $35.1million (£22million).","Monet's famous Nympheas reaches middle of estimate as it sells for $40.75m (£25.5m)

Terrified: Rhianna Shaw, 23, was entombed in the snow for an incredible 15 minutes after an avalanche on the Austrian mountain where she was skiing . A British skier has survived after she was buried alive in an avalanche and declared clinically dead. Rhianna Shaw, 23, was entombed in the snow for 15 minutes following the accident in the Austrian mountains. There is only a six per cent chance of resuscitation once someone has been buried in deep snow for eight minutes. Miss Shaw, from Chichester, West Sussex, said yesterday it was ‘absolutely terrifying’ as she could not move and her friends could not hear her screams for help. She said: ‘There was several feet of snow on top of me. You usually think snow will move but it just sets like concrete around you. ‘I was absolutely frozen and  I couldn’t move an inch. I could just about make out which way was up as a little bit of light was coming through and I could hear faint sounds. ‘All I could do was scream for help, but no one could hear me. ‘They thought I might have skied off and I could hear my mobile ringing in my pocket but I couldn’t answer it. It was absolutely terrifying.’ The accident happened on Thursday last week when Miss Shaw, who is spending the ski season working in Austria, was skiing off piste near St Anton with five friends. She had been out on the same slopes several times before. She said: ‘We hadn’t had snow for a couple of weeks then lots came down and it was a lovely sunny day so we decided to go out. Remarkable: Medics were astonished Rhianna, pictured here being dug out of the snow, had survived as there is only a six per cent chance of resuscitation once you are buried for more than eight minutes . ‘We went round this one bit and me and my friend Alistair were coming down side by side and he was on a snowboard and we had a minor collision and I lost both skis. ‘It normally wouldn’t be a problem but it started a bit of snowfall. Then the others came down and a massive ledge of snowfall broke away and it carried me down the slope around 150 metres. ‘I was completely buried alive and no part of me was above the surface. I would rather have not been conscious but I was. ‘I couldn’t move, my arms were frozen. The most I could do was shriek, but they couldn’t hear me. I tried not to panic.’ She owes her life to her quick-thinking friends, who formed a chain across the mountain and retraced their steps, using  ski poles to probe the snow as they searched for her. They found the back of her leg and managed to dig her out. Scenic: Rhianna Shaw was skiing at the Austrian resort of St Anton when she buried alive by an avalanche . By this time, Miss Shaw was clinically dead as she had no pulse and was not breathing. But one of her friends gave her CPR – and against the odds, it worked. She added: ‘I must have been buried for at least 15 minutes and probably stayed conscious for five minutes. ‘I was conscious I was trapped and I would probably die. There is only a six per cent chance of resuscitation once you are pulled out of the snow like that so I was incredibly lucky.’ After 11 minutes buried under the snow, most skiers die. Miss Shaw was taken to hospital by helicopter and put on a drip. A week on, she is ‘doing well’ but still haunted by the accident. She said: ‘It hits me at strange times. It’s like a weird bad  dream. I won’t be going off piste again in a hurry.’ St Anton was one of the resorts cut off after 10ft of powder fell  in the Austrian Alps in just  48 hours last month, leaving all roads in and out of the village closed and an estimated 1,000 British tourists stuck. Avalanche expert Rudi Mair said at the time: ‘This is a type of snowfall the like of which we have not seen for years. Combined with that, there are very high winds which are making conditions especially dangerous.’","Rhianna Shaw could not move, and her friends could not hear her screams .

These are the first pictures of how the famous In and Out club will look following its restoration from £200million wreck to Britain's most luxurious home. Formerly one of the world's most exclusive gentlemen's clubs, the central London mansion fell into ruin over the space of 100 years. Now billionaire property tycoon brothers David and Simon Reuben are transforming it into a palatial 48-room residence. Sheer elegance: The home's ballroom will boast shiny wooden floors, a gigantic chandelier and floor to ceiling windows . Dream home: The reception room is pictured with a deep red carpet, tiles around the edge and pretty finishing touches . Covetable: The billionaire Reuben brothers intend to transform Cambridge House into a £200million palatial home . They bought the crumbling grade I listed . mansion, opposite Green Park, last year for £130million and have now . submitted plans to Westminster City Council. The former In and Out Club on Piccadilly will now be returned to its former glory with 53,426 square foot of space - meaning the buyer will be spending £3,750 per square foot. Photos of the extravagant pile show wide polished floors, enormous windows, vaulted ceilings and glittering chandeliers. The rooms are finished with statuettes, classically elegant furniture and a grand piano - giving an idea of the sort of person likely to live in the exclusive building. Plans: The once palatial In and Out Club on Piccadilly fell into ruin but will be turned into Britain's most expensive home . Designed by architect Paul Davis + Partners, the mansion will boast an underground swimming pool, gym and 35,000-bottle wine cellar. Experts are predicting it could fetch £214m, £74m more than Russian billionaire Andrey Borodin paid for Park Place near Henley-on-Thames in Oxfordshire - currently Britain’s most expensive pad. Trevor Abrahmsohn, who runs Glentree Estates, which regularly sells properties on this . scale, described the home as a 'great opportunity' for a wealthy . foreigner to buy a piece of English heritage. But the estate agent added it is unlikely anyone will know when the completed home changes hands. He said: 'It would make a wonderful home and be one of the largest private residences in the UK. Billionaires: Brothers David Reuben, left, and Simon Reuben, right, want to restore Cambridge House to its former glory . Beautiful: The Grade I listed building was designed by Matthew Brettingham for Charles Wyndham, 2nd Earl of Egremont in the 1750s and was one of London's most impressive structures . 'No one has got much more than £120 million for a home in London but that is not to say it wouldn’t happen. 'This is a unique property and a great opportunity for a very wealthy person who wants a landmark home in London. 'For them, it is about buying a piece of English heritage but you won’t know when it is has been sold. 'Properties like this will be sold through the grey market - when no information is made public.' Cambridge House or No. 94 Piccadilly was London's most exclusive property when it was built more than 250 years ago. The grade I listed mansion on the northern side of Piccadilly was built for Charles Wyndham, 2nd Earl of Egremont, by architect Matthew Brettingham. It changed hands several times until 1829  when it was bought by Prince Adolphus, Duke of Cambridge, when it took the name Cambridge House, which has stuck ever since. Thirty-one years later prime minister Lord Palmerston bought it and lived there for 20 years until he died in 1865. His body was even taken from there to Westminster Abbey for his funeral. It was then bought by the Naval and Military Club and became known as the 'In and Out Club' because of the iconic signs on its gate posts, which still remain today. For more than a century it stayed as the exclusive private members club until it moved, and Cambridge House was bought as a development opportunity but the project went bust and the property fell into ruin. It has now been empty ever since 1999 but this new project by the Reubens, who bought it last year, could now restore it to its former glory. The premises started life as a villa designed by Matthew Brettingham for the Second Earl of Egremont in the 1750s. It was adopted by the Naval and Military club, which became fondly known as the In and Out Club due to the prominent signs on the entrance and exit gates, in the 1870s. Members continued to meet there until 1999 when the club moved to its current home at No.4 St James’s Square. Earlier this year, royal patron the Duke of Edinburgh Prince Philip joined other bowler-hat clad members there to celebrate the institution’s 150th anniversary. Originally established in 1862 because all other service clubs had reached their full membership quotas, it was initially only open to military officers. This is no longer the case, however, and now both women and men who have not served in the Armed Forces can join. Famous past members include British army officer Lawrence of Arabia, James Bond author Ian Fleming and poet Rudyard Kipling. Naval officer Robert Falcon Scott, who led two expeditions to the Antarctic, also frequented the club. The Reuben brothers were ranked second in this year’s Forbes magazine List of Billionaires with an estimated fortune of £6billion. After making their money in Russian aluminium, they branched into the London real estate market. Their portfolio includes the Millbank Tower, the John Lewis headquarters in Victoria, Carlton House in SW1, Connaught House on Berkeley Square and prime Sloane Street shops. They have also been involved in the regeneration of the Paddington area through the Merchant Square scheme and are in the process of creating a 340,000 square foot mixed-use development on Albert Embankment. At Piccadilly, they also have plans for the house next door to the former In and Out Club – No.95 previously the American Club – and for six luxury flats on another part of the site.

Doctors have enjoyed pay rises of up to three times the rate of inflation despite the public sector pay freeze, it was revealed yesterday. NHS Employers, the body which negotiates salaries with the unions, said the earnings of individual doctors had gone up by between three and eight per cent a year since 2010. They said if doctors’ pay was increased next year, it may put patient care at risk because savings would have to come from the front line. Doctors have enjoyed pay rises of up to three times the rate of inflation, despite the public sector pay freeze . Doctors’ pay rises over the past two years – which compare with an inflation rate of 2.5 per cent – come mainly as a result of stipulations built into their contracts. Even though there is meant to be a pay freeze, what this means in practice is that staff are not allowed to move to a higher pay band. But they still get specified ‘incremental’ increases within their pay band, simply for continuing to do the same job. It means that a typical new consultant appointed in 2010 on £81,954 would now be earning £89,652 – an increase of 9 per cent. The figures do not include the salaries of GPs, who are effectively self-employed. NHS Employers used the revelation to argue that the pay for doctors should be ‘frozen’ for the third year in a row. The body told the Doctors’ and Dentists’ Review Body the move was ‘essential to protect services and minimise job losses’. NHS Employers said it did not believe increases in national pay rates from April next year were necessary or affordable. Last week, financial experts warned that monetary pressures on the health service, which has been told to make £20billion in efficiency savings by 2015, will start to bite next April as the two-year public sector pay freeze comes to an end. The King’s Fund report said an average staff pay increase of 1 per cent would add £400-£500million to NHS expenditure. The NHS Employers submission to the review body said the remuneration package for doctors remained ‘highly competitive’ when pension and non-pay benefits were taken into account. 'If we do increase pay...it will mean less investment for patient services and a greater risk of NHS job losses' Dean Royles, director, NHS Employers . Dean Royles, director of NHS Employers, said: ‘Everyone, including doctors, knows these are challenging times for us all. The simple truth is that NHS organisations cannot afford an unnecessary increase in doctors’ pay rates over the next year without it impacting on patient care. ‘We understand the frustration felt by many doctors about freezing pay scales, but we know they recognise the financial challenges facing all organisations. Most doctors in the NHS already benefit from annual incremental pay increases and pay progression through training. Any additional increase is unaffordable for the NHS. 'Frustration': The doctors' union said there is already a 'major problem with morale' ‘Sixty-five pence of every NHS pound is spent on staff and they do a tremendous job. We must, however, make sure we get the best possible value for the money we have available to us.’ He added: ‘If we do increase pay, we risk serious consequences for the sustainability of some NHS services and their responsiveness to local needs. ‘It will mean less investment for patient services and a greater risk of NHS job losses.’ The British Medical Association, the trade union for doctors, rejected Mr Royles’s comments. Chairman Dr Mark Porter said: ‘The argument that continuing the freeze on doctors’ pay will help NHS employers maintain quality of care simply does not stand up to scrutiny. ‘There is already a major problem with morale, with doctors at the front line dealing with huge efficiency savings and wholesale NHS reorganisation. ‘Maintaining and improving care in the face of probably the biggest ever financial challenge for the NHS requires a more strategic response than just continuing to cut the terms and conditions of its staff.’","Increasing doctors' pay next year would be at the expense of front line services, NHS Employers claims .

'If . their priority is, figuratively speaking, Assad's head, the supporters . of such approach must realize that the price for that will be lives of . the Syrians, not their own lives,' Lavrov said. 'Bashar Assad isn't . going anywhere and will never leave, no matter what they say. He can't . be persuaded to take that step.' The Red Cross also said today that the civil war in Syria has been in a . downward spiral since summer which makes it impossible for the charity to cope with some of the country's humanitarian needs. Peter Maurer, the head of the . Geneva-based International Committee of the Red Cross, said that despite . his organization's improved scope of operations in the country, 'we . can't cope with the worsening of the situation.' 'The seriousness of the crisis is deepening with every day and this trend has been uninterrupted since summer,' Maurer said. Since summer the Red Cross has . improved its transportation and logistics, making it easier to bring in . truckloads of food and medicine, but it has become overwhelmed by the . dire need of hundreds of thousands of people struggling inside the . country, he said. The full interview with Assad will be broadcast on Friday, the TV station said.","Assad said he will never flee his country despite the bloody 19-month-old uprising against him .

About eight thousand refugees fleeing violence in Syria have crossed into Turkey in the last 24 hours, a Turkish foreign ministry official said on Friday. It followed an offensive by rebels, who have driven President Bashar al-Assad's troops from much of northern Syria, on a frontier town on Thursday night. The rebels are now in control of a number of crossing points on the Syrian-Turkish border. Their latest assault captured the town of Ras al-Ain, an Arab and Kurd town in the north-eastern oil-producing province of Hasaka, 600km (375 miles) from Damascus. Ten people were killed in clashes as residents fled a few hundred metres across the border to the Turkish town of Ceylanpinar, according to unverified reports overnight. Scroll down for video . Fleeing the violence: Syrian refugees from the town of Ras al-Ain run for the Turkish border last night as clashes between rebels and Bashar al-Assad's troops escalated . Dangerous: An injured man is helped towards the Turkish town of Ceylanpinar. Ten people were reported dead as rebels took control of the neighbouring Syrian town of Ras al-Ain . 'The crossing is important because it opens another line to Turkey, where we can send the wounded and get supplies,' said Khaled al-Walid, a commander in the Raqqa Rebel Division. In the last three months, the mainly Sunni Muslim Arab rebels have captured a string of outposts on the 910km (560 mile) northern border, steadily moving towards the northeast which is home to many of Syria's one million Kurds. However, the encroachments have enraged many Kurds, who want no part in the violence. The Kurdish Council, a coalition of Kurdish parties opposed to Assad, called on the Free Syrian Army to leave Ain al-Arab, a border town of 54,000 people further west. Anxious moments: Syrian refugees of all ages scramble through barbed wire fences in broad daylight as they escape fierce fighting . They said the clashes, as well as the fear of reprisals by the Syrian army, had prompted most of the town's inhabitants to flee. 'While the Kurdish Council affirms it is part of the revolution to bring down this totalitarian regime, the province of Hasaka must remain a safe area for thousands of refugees who had fled to it from other regions,' a statement said.. 'Military elements have to pull out so their presence would not serve as an excuse to shell the town and destroy it.' Guard: Turkish soldiers watch Syrians trying to flee into their country at a border checkpoint close to the town of Ras al-Ain . Adrian Edwards, spokesman for the United Nations refugee agency, said in Geneva that there had been a 'large movement' of Syrian refugees into Turkey's Urfa province in the past 24 hours, a period co-inciding with the rebel offensive. Turkey is already sheltering more than 120,000 Syrian refugees. The Turkish state-run Anatolian news agency also reported that 26 Syrian military officers had also arrived in Turkey with their families overnight - the biggest mass desertion of senior soldiers from Assad's forces in months. Meanwhile, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said at least 12 people were killed by army shelling in the eastern town of al-Qurriya. There were further clashes in the capital Damascus, with rebels and soldiers fighting in Kfar Souseh, a rich neighbourhood just a couple of miles from the presidential palace. On Wednesday, rebels fired mortars at the palace but missed. Air strike: Smoke rises from the eastern Damascus suburb of Arbeen on Thursday following an attack by a MIG fighter jet . An opposition activist in central Damascus said police stations and state buildings had been fortified in anticipation of further rebel attacks. 'First we saw the most important buildings protected.

Damascus has become steadily more militarised as a result of rebel attacks and battles rage in pro-opposition suburbs. The activist added that extra guards were posted months ago at security centres, the central bank and government offices. Concrete blocks had been installed in recent weeks. The Syrian Observatory, which is based in Britain, said at least 38,000 people have now been killed since the revolt against Assad started 20 months ago.

Former soldier Ricardo MacKenzie was jailed for 10 years for smuggling a cache of guns and ammo into the UK from Iraq in a tank . A former soldier has been jailed for 10 years after smuggling a cache of guns and ammunition from Iraq into the UK in a tank. Ricardo McKenzie joined the Army in April 2001 as a private in the Princess of Wales's Royal Regiment, 1st Battalion, but sneaked the weapons into the UK in 2006. The 35-year-old served in Iraq before being discharged from duty in September 2008, but was arrested on October 28, 2011, after a police raid on two homes in south London. Inner London Crown Court heard last week how the first cache - a Hungarian-made FEG SA 85M semi-automatic assault rifle rifle - similar to an AK-47 - and a Colt 45 self-loading handgun - was found by cops during a raid at address in West Norwood. The raid was planned by Operation Trident - a specialist unit in the Met set up to tackle gun crime in the black community. After McKenzie's arrest at the first address, officers searched his home in Balham, south London, where they found a Dirty Harry-style Magnum revolver and bags full of ammunition, including deadly dum-dum bullets - which expand on impact. McKenzie told the court that he had smuggled the weapons back from Iraq in 2006 in a tank and hid them in his barracks before being discharged in 2008. He told the court he wanted to keep them as 'collectors items'. He had admitted three counts of possessing a firearm and a further five counts of possessing ammunition at a previous court hearing, but on August 16 was found guilty of three counts of possessing a firearm with intent to endanger life. He was jailed for ten years for the possession of firearm offences and seven years for the possession of ammunition offences, to run concurrently - meaning he will serve 10 years inside. A spokesman for the Met said: 'On Friday, October 28, 2011, officers executed a search warrant at an address in West Norwood and McKenzie was arrested leaving the premises. 'Found inside the premises was a Colt .45 self-loading handgun with ammunition, and a Hungarian FEG SA 85M semi-automatic rifle, together with a quantity of 7.62mm ammunition. 'Upon searching McKenzie's home at Balham, a Weihrauch Magnum .357 revolver was found in his bedroom, together with .38 ammunition, some of which was of an expanding type. Police found this Magnum and dum dum bullets in a raid on Ricardo McKenzie home in south London . A Colt handgun and ammo recovered by police. McKenzie told the court that he had smuggled the weapons back from Iraq in 2006 in a tank and hid them in his barracks before being discharged in 2008 . MacKenzie admitted three counts of possessing a firearm and a further five counts of possessing ammunition and was found guilty of three counts of possessing a firearm with intent to endanger life . 'McKenzie initially told police that the Colt handgun, together with ammunition, had been brought back from Iraq as a collector's item some time in 2006. 'The gun was then supposedly brought back into the UK hidden inside a tank. 'He claimed to then have hidden the gun at his army barracks before he left the army in 2008.' Detective Chief Inspector Gary Bruce, from Trident, said: 'The conviction of Ricardo McKenzie is the culmination of a great deal of hard work by DI Chris Jones, Trident North-East Team and the CPS. 'It has led to the imprisonment of a dangerous offender and removal of three lethal firearms and ammunition from the streets of London, weapons which would undoubtedly have been used to commit acts of serious violence. 'Trident operations such as this one help to ensure that it is still difficult for criminals to obtain guns and that those who do are arrested.'","Ricardo McKenzie served in Iraq before being discharged in 2008 .

There are already shrines somewhere in the world for taps, lunchboxes, lawnmowers, carrots and even salt and pepper shakers - but one household item more important than all of those had been shamefully overlooked. Until now. The world's first 'toilet theme park' has opened in Korea, a bizarre homage to indoor sanitation and everything we put into it. The 'Restroom Cultural Park' in Suwon has been opened in memory and tribute to former mayor Sim Jae-Duck, affectionately known as 'Mr Toilet', who campaigned his entire life to improve Korea's often antiquated public conveniences.

Honour: Sim Jae-Duck devoted his life to improving the state of public toilets in Korea and founded the World Toilet Association . And this extraordinary place reflects everything he achieved - and it certainly seems Korea takes after Britain in terms of 'toilet humour.' From the bronze statues of people sitting on the toilet dotted around outside, to the converted toilet-shaped house which contains an exhibition on toilets through the ages, everything here is themed after one thing. There is even a room devoted to toilet-related art - fitting in a city which holds the annual Golden Poop art festival. It might not seem like the most attractive tourist destination, but Lee Youn-Souk, who works at the park, thinks differently. She told the BBC: 'We just focus on eating everyday, we sometimes overlook the importance of the toilet. 'We already know upon waking up in the morning we should go to the toilet but people don't want to talk about this. 'So we wanted to demonstrate to the public out 'toilet culture'. The toilet is not just a toilet, it can be a cultural space. '[They are] so important for health, sanitation and water conservation.' Mr Jae-Duck agreed - he was reportedly born in his grandmother's WC, as this apparently brings good luck, and spent much of his working life trying to improve facilities. He founded the World Toilet Association and unveiled his impressive toilet-shaped house on the eve of the organisation's first General Assembly meeting in 2002. The people of Suwon take great pride in them too and some are even tourist spots. They also stumped up the cash so his £1.2m toilet-shaped house could be converted into a theme park after his death. Time will tell if it becomes a must-visit destination.","The 'Restroom Cultural Park' has opened near Suwon in homage to former mayor and toilet campaigner Sim Jae-Duck .

Bankers who used to work for Lehman Brothers are in line to collect a slice of the bonuses they were promised before the Wall Street institution collapsed, sparking the 2008 global financial crisis. The administrator to Lehman's European operations has agreed to hand back an initial chunk of money to 1,582 creditors who are collectively seeking to recover £7billion. They will get about 25p for every pound they are owed. Bonuses: Former Lehman Brothers bankers will get 25p for every pound owed . Lehman Brothers became one of the biggest casualties of the credit crunch after racking up billions in losses on sub-prime mortgages and commercial property investments. But the prospect of bankers who are blamed for causing the financial crisis still profiting from their actions prompted criticism last night. Deborah Hargreaves, director of the High Pay Centre, said: 'Bankers are always keen to help themselves. Surely, there are other more deserving creditors? After all, the bankers are the ones who caused the collapse in the first place.' The first round of payments could be followed by others as PwC sells off assets and recovers money owed to Lehman before the bank went out of business,  which forced the US Treasury into its largest-ever financial bailout. Around 650 smaller creditors with claims of less than £150,000 have already opted to accept PwC's offer of a one-off payment of 90p in the pound to settle. Another 689 cases with a combined value of £1.3bn have yet to be agreed due to their complex trading relationships with Lehman. Profits: Critics are unhappy with bankers blamed for causing the financial crisis profiting from their actions . PwC's Tony Lomas said: 'The payment of this significant dividend to such a large number of Lehman Brothers unsecured creditors is an important milestone for the administration. 'We look forward to returning a substantial amount of cash to creditors later this month.' Lomas has described his work unravelling the finances of Lehman's European arm as a 'gargantuan task' and ten times more complicated than dealing with the bankruptcy of collapsed energy trader Enron. The bank had around £670billion of trades outstanding with more than 7,000 counterparties – buyers and sellers. It operated through more than 200 separate companies across the world, with 36 registered in the UK alone. Many of Lehman's 4,500 staff in the UK, mostly employed in London's Canary Wharf, lost their jobs despite Barclays and Nomura buying up parts of the collapsed firm, which was once one of Wall Street's most venerable institutions. Most were also investors in the bank who saw the value of their holdings wiped out when it was decided to wind up the business.","The administrator to Lehman's European operations has agreed to hand back an initial chunk of money to 1,582 creditors ."

A 66-year-old man who lived alone has been found drowned almost two weeks after super storm Sandy, bringing the death toll to 42. David Maxwell was found by police in his living room with his cat which had also drowned at the yellow Midland Beach home. 'It's so horrible,' his neighbour Dorothy Matthews, 71, told the New York Post. 'He was alone in the world except for his cat and his partner in the nursing home.' Tragic find: Eleven days after Hurricane Sandy devastated the northeast, the 42nd victim has been found in a 66-year-old man who lived alone in this Staten Island house . Friends said Mr Maxwell was a former Marine who served in Vietnam. The neighborhood is still flooded with trash and other waste in the storm's aftermath. Mrs Matthews said that a foul smell may have been the only thing that sent officers in to check on him. 'I don't know who called it in, but it was probably someone who thought the smell came from rotting flesh,' she said. After his partner, 72-year-old James McCormick suffered a stroke placing him in a nursing home, a neighbor said that he was still Mr Maxwell's whole life whom he visited as much as he could. A nursing home caretaker who arrived at the home on his partner’s behalf expressed her grief saying that they had wondered why he hadn't visited or called. 'He shouldn't have been left here for so long,' Irene Fontanez told the Post. Drowning: Mr Maxwell's cause of death was ruled as drowning with the 66-year-old in an area still wrecked with debris and flood waters from Hurricane Sandy, his New York borrow pictured . Hit hard: Half of the city's deaths were people from Staten Island, one of their neighbourhoods pictured early last week .

Britain's rubbish sent to China for recycling is being returned to UK landfills because the quality is so poor. Nearly 70 per cent of plastics able to be recycled are shipped to the Far East as UK households fail to re-use and process them at home. Historically, China accepted it to process the materials. Waste is being sent back to British landfills after China has rejected low quality plastics . Don't dump it here: China has cracked down on the type and quality of materials it processes . But the country has now clamped down on the low quality of items sent to it - particularly those that have been 'contaminated', the Daily Telegraph reported. The Environment Agency has warned that in this year alone 17 containers, containing 420 tons of plastic, have been refused by Asian countries as the government cracks down on 'dirty' plastics. Recycling experts warned of a 'plastics mountain' if China cracks down further, according to the Daily Telegraph. China announced in October that it may enforce regulations that would spell disaster for Britain in terms of dumping their waste elsewhere. The regulations ban imported unwashed post-consumer plastic, any waste being transferred to a company other than that stated on the import licence; and stopping the trade of unwashed plastic leftover from the sorting of imported plastic and paper. Now Beijing has warned that China may stop accepting unwashed, household plastics scrap altogether as it strives to recycle only high quality materials. Households have not been properly processing their waste, despite efforts to encourage people to make more of an effort . Most local authorities in England do not insist people categorise their rubbish, allowing them to lump all recyclable materials such as plastic and glass into once collection. Despite this jumble of mixed materials, a recycling facility sorts them - but even this will not meet the standards demanded by the Chinese as bales are often 'contaminated' by households throwing the wrong sort of thing in the recycling bin. Owen Paterson, the Environment Secretary, said he was aiming to improve Britain’s recycling infrastructure and not rely on outsiders to help with the country processing its waste. He told the Daily Telegraph: 'Trade in recyclable materials is a global market and I want to see UK businesses make money from it to help boost our economy. 'I want to see our own recycling industry grow, so we can grasp this opportunity with both hands.' Despite his statement, figures revealed that millions of tons of household rubbish was burned instead of recycled by councils last year. The . amount sent to incinerators shot up by almost a quarter -  while the . amount sent for recycling went up by barely a single percentage point.

Women are not allowed in the gang but are used to help members with phone calls, internet access, and using the postal system to pass along messages - including orders to kill. According to the FBI, the Aryan Brotherhood of Texas was first organized in the early 1980s inside the Texas prison system. The gang looked to another white supremacist prison gang, California's Aryan Brotherhood, as a base to model themselves on. While the ABT's original goal was to offer protection for white inmates and encourage white separatism, they allegedly expanded into a violent criminal empire.","10 gang members could face the death penalty if convicted .

Actress Kirstie Alley has revealed she fell in love more than 20 years ago with John Travolta as she rejected widespread Hollywood speculation that the “Grease” star is secretly gay. Alley, former star of the 1980s TV comedy 'Cheers,' told ABC television journalist Barbara Walters that she fell for both Travolta and actor Patrick Swayze in the 1980s, although she claimed their romances never got physical. Alley, 61, said she was attracted to Travolta while the pair were making the 1989 movie 'Look Who’s Talking,' calling him 'the greatest love of my life.' Alley and Travolta worked together on the hit comedy Look Who's Talking . Kirsty Alley with John Travolta and his wife Kelly Preston . 'Believe me, it took everything I had inside, outside, whatever, to not run off and marry John and be with John for the rest of my life,' Alley told Walters in an interview broadcast on breakfast TV show “Good Morning America.” Asked by Walters to comment on persistent rumours about Travolta’s sexuality, she said: 'I know John with all my heart and soul. He’s not gay.' Alley added: 'I think in some weird way, in Hollywood, if someone gets big enough and famous enough, and they’re not out doing drugs and they’re not womanizing, what do you say about them?' Travolta was single at the time, but Alley was on her second marriage, so she never pursued her feelings, she explained. Travolta later married actress Kelly Preston, his wife for the past 20 years. But the actor was the target of two lawsuits earlier this year, which were quickly dropped, from two male masseurs who claimed Travolta made unwanted sexual advances. Alley, who talks more about her love life in her new book, “The Art of Men,” said she fell for Swayze while they were filming the 1985 Civil War TV miniseries 'North and South.' 'We did fall in love. I was more willing to break up my marriage and I wasn’t willing to break up his marriage,' Alley said, explaining why the relationship failed to go further. Swayze, best known for his lead role in 'Dirty Dancing,' died of pancreatic cancer in 2009 at the age of 57. He was married to dancer Lisa Niemi from 1975 until his death.

Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin has repeatedly blamed civil servants for the £100million fiasco, insisting ministers are not to blame . Official investigators into the Government’s West Coast franchise fiasco have demanded an electronic audit of Transport Department staff e-mails in a bid to unearth evidence of a biased ‘Anyone But Branson’ campaign. Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin made the admission today while giving evidence to the transport select committee. Appearing alongside his Permanent Secretary Philip Rutnam, he said the two independent investigations into the shambles had asked ministers and senior officials to instigate a ‘e-mail capture’ system to electronically scan for and root out any potentially biased internal references to Sir Richard Branson and Virgin Trains during their bid to retain the franchise. It follows allegations revealed in the Daily Mail that there was an ‘anti-Virgin’ culture within the Transport Department which had been reflected in some ‘derogatory’ e-mails which pointed towards institutional bias among some staff. Mr McLoughlin admitted his department made 'very regrettable' errors in its handling of the bidding process for Britain’s busiest rail line. The minister was forced to explain to a select committee why his department ploughed ahead with the bidding process for the West Coast Main Line contract despite knowing the process was flawed. Mr McLoughlin said ‘basic mistakes’ had led to a ‘catastrophic failure.’ It would be a ‘text book chapter’ for future Civil Service training. The 13-year deal was handed to rival . firm First Group in August, but last month days after becoming Mr McLoughlin announced serious flaws had been found. The . deal was cancelled, and ministers spent £1million drawing up plans for . the government to take over running the line from London to Scotland . before asking Sir Richard to continue providing services for up to a . year. Mr McLoughlin told the transport select committee: 'Mistakes which were made should not have been made. It is very regrettable and very serious for the department. ‘We have already apologised to the bidders involved and the taxpayers who have a right to expect better and I would repeat that.' An official report this week claimed the Department for Transport was biased against Sir Richard Branson’s Virgin Trains bid to continue running the West Coast mainline. Louise Ellman, chairman of the committee, said the interim report 'can only be described as a damning indictment’ of the Department for Transport. The fiasco was ‘major catastrophe’ that had huge implications for the whole of the rail franchise process, she added. But Mr McLoughlin insisted there were ‘a lot of people who work incredibly hard in the department who had noth9ng to do with this West Coast franchise and I wouldn’t want them to be condemned’. He said it was now ‘obvious’ that decisions were taken by middle-ranking officials which were ‘not referred up’ to senior civil servants or ministers’. The devastating interim report into the West Coast fiasco made for uncomfortable reading for the Department for Transport. The key findings of Sam Laidlaw's investigation included: . Asked if he was grateful to Sir Richard’s for launching a legal challenge which highlighted the flaws, Mr McLoughlin added: ‘I think the country owes a debt of gratitude to Richard Branson for all he has achieved in the rail and aviation industries.’ But his comments appeared at odds with revelations about his department's attitude to Sir Richard. Insider witnesses described this culture as ‘ABB’ or – ‘Anyone But Branson.’ They said it had its roots in Virgin’s successful and tough re-negotiaton of its franchise in 2006 which had left Whitehall officials feeling battered and ‘nailed to the floor’ after being outwitted by a smarter Virgin team. Asked by MPs whether staff e-mails were to be scanned as part of the investigation Mr McLoughlin said: ’They have asked for it to be done. We have now received a request.’ Asked if he could have asked more questions to unearth earlier the scale of the fiasco, Mr McLoughlin said: 'Perhaps I could have asked more questions but I would have got the same answers.’ Mr Rutnam side-stepped questions about ‘who knew what and when’ by insisting he could not comment on it because the matter was still the subject of a ‘Human Resources’ investigated by personnel officials. Three staff have already been suspended. Mr Rutnam said: ’It would be wrong to pre-empt that investigation by saying who I believe is responsible.’ He said the ‘risks’ should have been ‘escalated’ to senior officials and ministers as soon as they were known, but were not: ’The question of who knew what, when will come out when these investigations, including the Humans Resources are completed. Virgin trains boss Sir Richard Branson branded the bidding process 'insane' and launched a legal challenge. He was vindicated this week when an official report said the Department for Transport was biased against him . On Monday the interim report into the fiasco concluded that the Transport Department was biased against Sir Richard Branson’s bid to continue running the West Coast mainline. But that was just one of a catalogue of failures – including of leadership- which contributed to the shambles, it concluded. The independent investigation into the scandal by Centrica chief executive Sam Laidlaw highlights ‘significant errors’, ‘weak governance’ , and a ‘flawed process’ with in which ‘bidders were treated inconsistently.’ But the report also highlights contributory factors including a general lack of leadership, late planning, hurried execution, and cut-backs within the transport Department which put key decisions into the hands of relatively junior, inexperienced and ‘stretched’ staff. Today Mr McLoughlin apologised to taxpayers who are now facing a £40million bill – which could rise to £100million - following Mr McLoughlin's decision to scrap the West Coast franchise process following the finding of serious errors by the DfT. Mrs Ellman asked the Department’s top civil servant Mr Rutnam, who only took up his post this summer, who at the department had taken the decision to go on with the bidding process regardless. Mr Rutnam replied: ""I am afraid that I am not going to answer that question"" saying that investigations into the whole matter were still going on. The Laidlaw report also said the companies bidding for the franchise were not provided with adequate information, the DfT did not follow its own guidance, and the evaluation of the financial robustness of the bids was ""developed late, in a hurry and without proper planning and preparation"". Mr Laidlaw said the DfT had undergone staff reductions and frequent changes of leadership, and organisational changes and the department's structure ""resulted in a lack of clarity around allocation of repsonsibility"" for the bidding competition. He concluded that these factors raised ""potentially significant issues about the ability of the DfT effectively to conduct rail franchise competitions"". Mr Rutnam said that when he arrived at the department in July he had received assurances that the West Coast process was ""going well"". He said it was not until October that defects and errors associated with the process became clear. The FirstGroup had been due to take over the West Coast line on December 9. The Government is now in discussions with Virgin about it continuing to run services for up to 14 months until an interim franchise competition is held ahead of a competition for a full franchise. The DfT, under the leadership of the then transport secretary Justine Greening, had decided in August to award a new 13 year West Coast franchise rival transport company FirstGroup for £7billion - £700million motre than Sir richard’s Virgin bid. Three civil servants have been suspended by the Departmernt as a result of the fiasco. But one of them, Kate Mingay, the . department's commercial and technical services director, issued a . statement through her lawyers shortly after her suspension saying her . role in the West Coast process had been ‘inaccurately portrayed mainly . due to statements and other comment made by the Department for Transport . itself’. She added: ‘I would like to make it . clear that I did not have lead responsibility for this project and that . neither I nor any member of my team had any responsibility for the . economic modelling for this project, or for any DfT project. ‘Nor did I have any responsibility for . the financial modelling in respect of this project and I have not been . involved in briefing DfT ministers or other Government ministers in . respect of this project.’","Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin and top civil servant reveal investigators have asked for emails to be scanned .

It is rapidly becoming tradition at this time of year for men to sprout moustaches as part of the increasingly popular Movember charity campaign. But the latest fundraiser to let their facial hair grow wild in the name of a good cause is a 36-year-old woman. Brave Siobhain Fletcher, 36, who suffers from polycystic ovary syndrome and has spent years trying to hide her facial hair, has ditched her clippers for the month of November to grow a moustache and beard for charity. Good cause: Siobhain Fletcher has spent her life trying to hide her facial hair, but has ditched the clippers to raise money for charity as part of the Movember campaign . The Movember campaign encourages men to quit shaving for the month of November to raise awareness and funds for men's health - specifically prostate cancer and testicular cancer. Mrs Fletcher, who usually shaves every other day, is already sporting a wispy beard and the beginnings of a moustache after deciding to take part. Having struggled with facial hair since puberty, the housewife was finally diagnosed with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) 12 years ago when she and her husband Jim struggled to conceive. Inspiring: Mrs Fletcher said growing her facial hair would be worth it if it encouraged just one man to get a life-saving health check . Mrs Fletcher said the problem had driven her to depression in the past, but that she was prepared to overcome her embarassment if it meant more men would address potentially life-threatening health issues. Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), is a hormonal imbalance in which women’s ovaries produce excessive amounts of the male hormone testosterone. This results in the formation of small harmless cysts on the ovaries. Excessive hair growth - known as hirsutism - is just one of the symptoms of the condition, alongside erratic periods, weight gain, acne, and fertility problems. The condition, which affects one in ten British women, should not be confused with polycystic ovaries, which merely describes the appearance of small cysts on the ovaries. Roughly 20 per cent of women have this condition with no effects at all and no problems conceiving. Women with PCOS have both the cysts and the symptoms caused by excess testosterone. 'If I can go out on the street with a beard or moustache for a month, then surely men who are experiencing health problems can go and get themselves tested. 'I think it is awful that some men are too embarassed to have a simple test which could save them from prostate or testicular cancer. 'My facial hair used to contribute to depression and anxiety but this is for a good cause and I want to highlight that people shouldn't judge you on what you have on your face, it's what is inside that matters.' The 36-year-old has already raised £200 on her Movember fundraising page, on which she has included a message describing how she hopes 'to use my PCOS as a tool for raising awareness for men's cancers - if I get just one man to get checked out it will be worth it'. Mrs Fletcher's page has been inundated with posts from donors impressed by her decision to reveal the embarassing side-effect of her condition for a good cause. One comment said: 'I think you are fab for doing this!! Very inspiring!!' Another read: 'As a fellow PCOS sufferer I know I'm nowhere near as brave as you but you rock - great kudos to your courage.'","Siobhain Fletcher, from Leek, Staffordshire, suffers from polycystic ovary syndrome, which can cause excessive facial hair .

From staying slim to the quest for perfect skin; a woman's list of beauty concerns is endless. But for ladies in China - who typically have little body hair - remaining fuzz-free was not top of their list of priorities. That is until a canny marketing campaign from the manufacturers of a hair removal cream successfully fostered a fuzz phobia among the country's women - and sent its Asian sales soaring as a result. Target customer: Sales of the hair-removal cream are on the rise in China thanks to a marketing campaign encouraging women to aspire to being fuzz-free . When Veet hair-removal cream first hit the shelves in China in 2005, sales were sluggish among local women blessed with relatively hair-free skin. So the manufacturers launched a new marketing campaign aimed at city women linking smooth, fuzz-free skin to health, confidence, and 'shining glory'. As a result, many well-groomed women in China are now as preoccupied by stray hairs as their western counterparts. Fuzz phobia: Veet is now its manufacturer's fastest growing Chinese brand . Asian sales of hair remover are rising by 20 per cent annually - almost double the rate of women's razors - according to research carried out by Euromonitor International. And Veet is now the fastest-growing brand in China for British manufacturers Reckitt Benckiser. Aditya Sehgal, the firm's China chief, told Business Week: 'It's not how much hair you have, it's how much you think you have. 'If your concern level is high enough, even one hair is too much.' The campaign is certainly not the first time a manufacturer has played on women's preoccupation with perceived flaws. Beauty giants Estee Lauder and L'Oreal both sell skin-whitening creams in China, where many women perceive lighter skin as preferable. Mr Sehgal said the firm's role was not to remind Chinese women how much hair they have, and insisted its customers were too 'independent-minded' to be persuaded to buy a product they didn't really need. More women in China are now as preoccupied by body hair as their western counterparts . But Benjamin Voyer, a social psychologist and assistant professor of marketing at ESCP Europe Business School, likened Veet's Chinese marketing to 'the apple in the Bible'. 'It creates an awareness, which subsequently creates a feeling of shame and need,' he told Business Week. PR consultant Maggie Li, 29, said she had been using Veet since receiving a free sample in the summer, and added that the product's marketing 'makes Chinese women more aware of their body hair issue'. The manufacturers targeted flooded university campuses with free samples and enlisted glamorous actress Yang Mi as a spokesmodel as part of its efforts to target female students and cosmopolitan city women. While Chinese sales of the product have noticeably increased on the back of the new marketing approach, it is still not a familiar brand outside of cities and is yet to benefit from a national advertising campaign. But if the strategy continues to work its magic there could be plenty of room for growth, as a study showed that just 0.6 per cent of Chinese women remove body hair.","A hair removal cream embraced a new marketing strategy linking fuzz-free skin to health and confidence .

It seems there are no lengths Sir Richard Branson won't go to to generate publicity, with the 62-year-old dressing up as a Maharaja and surrounding himself with a bevy of Indian beauties in Mumbai for his latest wacky PR stunt. Never afraid to make a fool of himself for the cameras, the billionaire performed a traditional dance, banged a drum and waved the Indian flag, all to mark the relaunch of Virgin Atlantic flights from London to Mumbai, India.

Earlier this month Branson's Virgin group was gifted a PR victory after the Department for Transport was forced to ask him to keep running trains on the West Coast main line. It came after Virgin Trains lost the lucrative contract to run Britain's busiest rail line in August. Virgin was due to hand over the line to rival First Group on December 9 but ‘significant technical flaws’ in the contract competition were unearthed this month, which saw three civil servants suspended and the deal torn up. The fiasco saw ministers pleading with Virgin Trains to remain in control of the line for between nine and 13 months while the government decides who will operate the franchise on a more permanent basis.

One in eight mortgages are now buy-to-let loans – the most since records began. ‘Landord loans’ now account for 1.44million of the 11.3million mortgages in this country, or  12.7 per cent. A decade ago, there were only 275,500 buy-to-let loans, equal to just 2.4 per cent of the market. Today’s figures from the Council of Mortgage Lenders show that not only are there more buy-to-let loans than ever before, they also account for the largest ever proportion of the overall market. The change is partly because a generation of young people have been locked out of the housing market by soaring house prices and tougher lending restrictions by banks. The figures come a day after Housing Minister Mark Prisk slammed Britain’s housing market as ‘dysfunctional’. The Tory MP said it ‘cannot be right’ that large numbers of people in their 20s and 30s cannot afford to buy their own home and have to stay living with their parents. Last month, a report from the Financial Services Authority, the City regulator, said the buy-to-let boom has added to the problems facing first-time buyers. It said the average age at which a young person manages to buy their first home is 31 and they earn an average salary of around £34,000. By comparison, a typical buy-to-let investor is between the age of 45 and 64 and is a higher-rate taxpayer, which means they earn more than £42,475. Banks tend to charge a higher interest rate on buy-to-let loans, based on the rental income from the property, than they do on standard mortgages, where they base it on a buyer’s salary. Traditionally, buy-to-let properties have also been considered higher risk because if owners get into financial difficulty they are far more likely to stop making repayments on a rental property than their own home. Housing minister Mark Prisk slammed the UK housing market as 'dysfunctional' With the base rate at an all-time low, many homeowners decide to put their nest egg into a second buy-to-let property as an alternative to keeping it in savings accounts offering tiny rates of interest. Dan McLeod, a director of the estate agency Atkinson McLeod, said: ‘The demand from investors for buy-to-let has never been stronger.’ Yesterday the Bank of England’s interest-rate setting committee voted to keep the base rate at 0.5 per cent for the 44th consecutive month, the longest period without a change since the aftermath of the Second World War. Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit, the consultancy, said: ‘The danger is that the Bank of England is looking increasingly helpless, working with ineffectual policy tools in an economy that looks set to worsen, which will do nothing to boost business and consumer confidence.’","'Landlord loans' now account for 1.44million of the 11.3million mortgages in the UK .

But in fact, the name – which is instantly associated with the Monty Python classic The Life of Brian – has the best ‘credit rating’ in Britain, according to a report published yesterday. Women with the name Helen also tend to have a good credit rating, as do those who live in the gold-plated postcode of SL4 in Windsor, home of David Cameron’s former school, Eton College. Best credit rating: The name Brian, which is instantly associated with Monty Python classic The Life of Brian (pictured), has the best 'credit rating' in Britain . The report, from the comparison website confused.com, looked at the records of tens of thousands of people to work out the names and addresses of those with the best credit record. It found people called Brian, Alan, Ian, Peter and Robert are the least likely to have a black spot on their credit history, such as being made bankrupt or missing their mortgage payment. This is because credit histories tend to be better among older people, who were brought up to avoid debt, to save and to spend only what they can afford, and worse among the young. And for most people, these are the names of their fathers or grandfathers, but not their boyfriends, husbands or sons. In fact, official records show that just one of these five names - Peter - appears in the top 100 of the most popular baby names in England and Wales last year. Young parents are more likely to call their baby Harry, Oliver, Jack, Alfie and Charlie, according to the Office for National Statistics. The name Brian has gradually slipped down the rankings of the most popular name from seventh position in 1944 to 51st by 1974, 87th in 1984 before falling out of the top 100 in 1994. Gold-plated postcode: Residents of SL4 in Windsor, home of school Eton College (pictured), also get a good credit rating in report comparing tens of thousands of people to work out the names and addresses of those with the best credit record . For women, the top five names with the best credit history are Helen, Susan, Julie, Elizabeth and Joanne. The report says the people with the best credit histories have the postcode SL4 one of the exclusive postcodes in Britain. This is the postcode of Winsor Castle, one of the Queen’s homes, and also Eton College, the leading boys’ private school which charges fees - before extras - of around £32,000 a year. Other top addresses are Guildford, Manchester, Southend-on-Sea and Portsmouth, with losers in Swansea, Birmingham, Torquay, Edinburgh and Wolverhampton. The worst names to have are Daniel, Lee, Matthew, Steven and Christopher. For women, the worst one are Lisa, Victoria, Emma, Nicola and Claire. Nerys Lewis, head of credit cards at Confused.com, said: ‘While our research shows the names with the best and worst credit profiles in the UK, people’s names are obviously not a rating factor when looking at credit. ‘If you’re called Brian, you won’t automatically be gifted with a great profile or penalised because your name is Lisa.’ The report is based on the financial records of tens of thousands of people who used the website’s credit card checking service between January and August this year.","The names Brian and Helen have the best credit rating in Britain according to a report .

The latest craze to sweep Seattle isn’t a new brand of coffee, or even some underground indie band – it’s a conservative evangelical church. But rather than hymns and hallelujahs, the Mars Hill Church in Seattle caters to a niche audience of contemporary young adults, and no subject is off limits. Those in the congregation regularly discuss traditionally taboo topics of sex and drinking, but in stark contrast, they hold many traditional biblical views and think homosexuality is a sin. Seattle's best: Mars Hill Church's services are held in a converted warehouse and feature rock 'n roll music . Founding father: Pastor Mark Driscoll, pictured, founded the church in the late 1990s; since then, the size of the congregation has grown exponentially . Enter Mark Driscoll, who founded the church in the late 1990s. He has become something of a symbol of the religious organization, often wearing signature rolled jeans and a blazer. He said that he was motivated to start a new kind of church after he realized most of the members of local churches were female, and the men, too, were effeminate. He said in a 2006 interview: ‘If you want to win a war, you have to get the men.’ Thus began his tough-love approach to Christianity. Driscoll holds services in a massive warehouse in Seattle, though Mars Hill now has several auxiliary campuses all over Washington state, with another in Los Angeles, and one in Albuquerque. The services often feature rock and roll music with guitars, bass, and drums, as opposed to traditional hymns, perhaps played on piano or organ. The website states the atmosphere is ‘casual, reflective, and open to all.’ The church’s Facebook page shows a long line of events, where LED lights are given to children at a party for Old Testament heroine Ester, and a wing cook-off, complete with artisan sauces. Likewise, many members sport tattoos, and enjoy indie rock - not things typically associated with a conservative Christian movement. Good clean fun: A member dresses up as the Mad Hatter for a Fall Family Festival at Mars Hill Ballard . Catering: Food trucks provided snacks for one church event; one member snapped this picture on Instagram . And Driscoll himself doesn’t shy away from topics, talking to millennial and Gen Y-ers about seemingly out-of-bounds topics like oral sex, as Alternet first reported. He also teaches that women should submit to their husbands as the church submits to Christ. As Alternet points out, Driscoll’s teachings are very in-line with hot-topic secular views of the decline of young men and the rising of young women. But, as the publication notes, Driscoll believes that women’s strength is caused by men’s weakness. The church offers counselling in gender roles. There are many stories of couples who were unhappy in their marriages, often times because Mars Hill said they weren’t submitting to their God-given roles of wife as nurturer and husband as bread-winner. Those who have chosen to leave the church have met a fair amount of controversy. A blog called Mars Hill Refugee chronicles the stories of those who left, giving reasons of why they felt it right to go and how they thought the church wronged them. Prayer: Members of Mars Hill pictured praying before the start of a service . Mingling: Members celebrated at a Mars Hill campus with sno-cones, cookies, and popcorn . One former member, Andrew, said that he was punished after it was revealed he was ‘sexually involved’ with another church member. In the Mars Hill Church Discipline Contract issued, it was alleged: ‘The repercussions of Andrew’s sin have been widespread…as a result, he is under church discipline with the hope and goal of full restoration upon walking in a repentant  lifestyle.’ He had to sign a contract over his ‘plan of discipline’ that involved writing out the chronology of his so-called illicit relationship and share it with a pastor. He was also to write a list of people he sinned against. A feature in The Stranger last January questioned if Mars Hill was in fact a church, or just a cult, churning out the types of men and women who would be beneficial to it, citing several cases where members balked at one part or another of the church and were punished for not adhering to the church’s authority. The article notes that Driscoll believes in his 'womb to tomb' philosophy - of creating and cultivating believers in Christ - but 'only if (members) don't ask too many questions.'","Mars Hill Church founded in late 90s to attract young men and women .

British Cycling’s head coach Shane Sutton is expected to make a full recovery from injuries sustained when he was knocked off his bike in Manchester on Thursday. Sutton was rushed to A&E suffering bruising and bleeding on the brain after the incident in Levenshulme – less than 24 hours after Tour de France champion Bradley Wiggins was knocked off his bike while training in Lancashire. Wiggins was discharged from hospital on Thursday with bruises to his hand and broken ribs. On the mend: British Cycling's head coach Shane Sutton should make a full recovery after being knocked off his bike in Manchester . Charming: Bradley Wiggins swore at photographers on his way home from hospital on Thursday . 'Ok': Wiggins left with at least two broken ribs after being knocked off his bike by a car . Good news came when British Cycling said that Sutton could be leaving hospital soon too. ‘Shane is making steady progress but . is likely to remain in hospital for one more day under observation,’ they said in a statement. ‘He has fractured his cheek bone . which will require surgery in due course. He is expected to make a . complete recovery and will be back in work shortly.’ Sutton, 55, one of Wiggins' coaches . for his time trial success at the London Olympics, was hospitalised with . bleeding and bruising on the brain following the road accident in . Levenshulme, Manchester, on Thursday morning. The incident came just a day after Wiggins was knocked off his bike by a Vauxhall Astra as it . pulled out of a filling station. He lay on the floor for a . quarter of an hour before the ambulance arrived, according to witnesses, and sustained at least two broken ribs and a suspected dislocated finger. A spokesperson for British Cycling . said on Thursday afternoon: 'British Cycling has confirmed that Shane Sutton, head coach for . the GB Cycling Team, was involved in an incident this morning on the A6 . near Levenshulme in Manchester. 'Shane was taken into hospital where it was identified he has suffered bruising and bleeding on the brain. 'Shane was wearing a helmet. He is set to undergo more tests, and is likely to stay in hospital for the next few days.' Hospitalised: Shane Sutton, Team GB's head cycling coach, was rushed to hospital on Thursday afternoon . The spokesperson added: 'It is extremely rare that our riders and coaches are hurt while out cycling on the road, even rarer that two incidents should occur in a short space of time, and we wish Shane and Bradley a speedy recovery. 'Cycling is not an intrinsically dangerous activity but there is much more to be done to improve conditions for cyclists on the roads. 'British Cycling is calling on the government to put cycling at the heart of transport policy to ensure that cycle safety is built into the design of all new roads, junctions and transport projects, rather than being an afterthought.' Police sources said the collision involving Sutton, on his bike, and a Peugeot 206 car took place at about 8.55am near the junction of Stockport Road and Clare Road in Levenshulme. The driver of the Peugeot was not injured and no arrests were made. British Cycling director Martin Gibbs . believes the Government should be doing more to prevent such incidents, and said: 'These . incidents do remind you that we've got a long way to go we need to look . to our cousins abroad and Copenhagen and see what they've done. '30 per cent of people making journey there do so on their bike. 'We need the Department of Transport to stop thinking of cycling as an add-on. 'Nine . out of 10 British cycling members have a car it has to be about more . mutual respect looking out for each other. We mustn't make this a sort . of tribal battle.' Australian Sutton has worked . with the GB Cycling team since 2002 and has been credited with playing a . major role in transforming the fortunes of the sport in this country. Unfortunate: Both Sutton (left) and Wiggins (right) were involved in unrelated accidents within 24 hours of each other . Mentor: Sutton was one of Wiggins' coaches when he sealed a time trial gold at London 2012 . He was awarded an OBE in the Queen's Birthday Honours list in 2010 for his services to sport. Sutton's career began as a road and track cyclist where he won numerous . titles including a Commonwealth Games gold medal in the 1978 team . pursuit competition and the 1990 Milk Race. He split his time between the track and the road in coaching this year's British competitors at the London Olympics. Throughout his career at GB Cycling, . he was said by Team Sky to have 'repeatedly got the best out of his . charges through his sheer enthusiasm and force of personality'. Police also confirmed that Wiggins, 32, had broken at least two ribs but has otherwise escaped with severe bruising. His support team who were following him raced to his aid at Wrightington, Lancashire, close to his home near Chorley. The mum of the cycling champion spoke to the star after the crash. Linda Wiggins, a school secretary, said: 'I have spoken to him briefly and he's okay.' Garage attendant Yasmin Smith, who also helped Wiggins, said: ‘By the time I got there he had moved to a safer place but was still on the ground and he was in a lot of pain. 'His hands looked bruised and they were curled up a bit. And then his colour changed. 'He got put in a local person's car and when the ambulance came they attended to him immediately. His wife [tried to] hug him and he said: 'Don't, my ribs'. 'He was assisted [in] walking to the ambulance. He could stand up. I think his ribs and hands were the main concern. ‘He said he thought he had broken his ribs and while a lot of police cars arrived it was about 15 minutes before the ambulance got there and by then he was blue.’ Another witness, truck driver Barry Blacklidge, arrived shortly after the incident. He told The Sun: 'I could see a pushbike, like a mountain bike, and the front wheel was all buckled. I went into the garage and asked what was going on.

Members of two warring Brooklyn gangs took to Facebook to brag about their fatal hits, and that boastfulness has landed nearly 50 of them in jail. The New York Police Department commissioner and Brooklyn district attorney who worked through the tangled virtual web that connected the different members of the two gangs- named the Very Crispy Gangsters and the Rockstarz. The young men friended their rivals on Facebook, but their requests were the opposite of friendly as they used their connections to post pictures proving their attacks. One man took a picture of himself wearing a belt and a watch of the man police suspected he shot. Cast of criminal characters: {police have identified 49 gang members that they plan to arrest in conjunction with three deaths and 12 shootings over the past three years . For the photo caption, the poster wrote 'I can’t give it back. You can’t walk no more'. After an incident that lead to the death of a Very Crispy Gangsters prompted the most chilling post by one of their rivals: 'Rockstarz are up 3-0' one wrote, referring to the number of Very Crispy Gangsters they had killed. 'Because of these individuals’ insatiable desire to brag about what they did, these investigators were able to draw a virtual map of their activities and bring them to justice,' police commissioner Ray Kelly said at a Wednesday press conference. The Wall Street Journal reports that all told, the police identified 49 of the alleged gang members. The New York Times reports that while 41 are in police custody, eight remain at large and their pictures were shown with 'Wanted' scrawled above. In keeping with the three-person body count that the gang members boasted about, they were charged with three murders and 12 shootings over the past three years. District attorney Charles Hynes said the gangs 'terrorized parts of the East New York community as they recklessly shot at one another in crowded parks and busy streets with no regard for innocent bystanders'. No where was safe: One of the shootings took place near Martin Luther King Jr. Park in Brooklyn . The first shooting came when Very Crispy Gangsters member Taquan Crandell, 18, was shot and killed in September 2009 by a Rockstarz member. Another victim was Johnny Santiago, a 17-year-old VCG member beaten to death in June of last year by 20 rival gang members. A video of the beating was posted on Youtube, with one of the attackers wearing Santiago's belt and watch, reciting the same chilling taunt that he used in the Facebook caption. The violence wasn't limited to gang members, as at least four others- including one police officer and one 10-year-old boy nearly killed by a stray bullet while he was inside watching cartoons- that were injured in the shootings were not associated with the gangs themselves. The Village Voice reported that even though many of the suspects are in jail, the violence may not come to an immediate end: during a recorded call, one Rockstarz member was heard telling a VCG member the names of VCG witnesses who were scheduled to testify against the Rockstarz. The Rockstarz member, named Brandon Matos, then 'offered to prevent the witnesses from making their court appearances'.","NYPD used Facebook friendships and photos to identify gang members .

Weiss made national news when she was accused at age 17 of strangling her newborn after giving birth to the baby boy in a bathroom and then disposing of the infant's body in a canal . Aimee Lee Weiss of Broward County died on Oct. 24 after ‘complaining about pain in her back and her heart started racing,’ family members told the Miami Herald. A medical examiner is performing an autopsy on her body to determine the cause of death. Weiss made national news when she was accused at age 17 of strangling her newborn after giving birth to the baby boy in a bathroom and then disposing of the infant’s body in a canal. She was charged with first-degree murder in the baby’s death in 2001 and the case dragged on until 2006, when she pleaded no contest to manslaughter charges. Weiss claimed that she didn’t strangle the boy, but that she thought the baby died during birth and that’s why she dumped his body in a canal. She received a sentence in 2006 of three years’ probation in the case. Shortly after she was charged with first-degree murder in 2001, Weiss became pregnant again and gave birth to a daughter who is now 10 years old and living with her paternal grandparents, Pam and Jim Walpole, in Texas. Weiss’ parental rights were terminated by the state of Florida as soon as the girl was born, although Weiss was permitted to nurse the baby for six months under the supervision of the Walpoles. Jim Walpole told the Miami Herald that Weiss’ daughter would learn of her mother’s death in a counseling session. The girl was hopeful that one day she would be able to meet her mother, Walpole said. ‘She would say, “I can’t wait till I’m 18 so I can be with Aimee,”’ Walpole told the newspaper. ‘The last time Aimee was with the baby was New Year’s Eve 2002,’ he said. ‘She was so happy, and the baby loved her. I promised [Aimee] I would do everything I possibly could to give [the baby] everything she couldn’t.’ Weiss was arrested once again in 2007 on charges of insurance fraud while she was still on probation for her newborn’s death. She was accused of defrauding patients at a chiropractor’s office where she worked. Her lawyers argued that Weiss was unaware of the scheme her employer was running and she received a seven-day sentence along with a $614.61 fine. Weiss was arrested a third time in 2010 and charged with prostitution and lewdness.

Chris Christie believed he was going to be Mitt Romney's running mate . New Jersey Governor Chris Christie was Mitt Romney’s first choice as a running mate before Romney had a sudden change of heart and dumped him for Paul Ryan. Christie was miffed by Romney’s decision, particularly because he was led to believe in the weeks leading up to Ryan’s introduction that he would be joining Romney on the Republican presidential ticket, Politico reported, citing conversations with ‘campaign insiders.’ Now Republican party bosses suspect Christie's momentary embrace of Barack Obama during the President's tour of devastated New Jersey this week was a deliberate snub to Romney. Christie was vetted so hard by the Romney campaign in July that even some of Romney’s top advisers believed the New Jersey governor was the final choice as the Republican vice presidential candidate. But Romney changed his mind over . the course of two weeks this summer, advisers told Politico, and instead . offered the job to Ryan, a Republican congressman from Wisconsin. Romney . was attracted to Christie for his unfiltered style that has helped turn . him into rising star – albeit a controversial one -- within the . Republican Party. The . explosive New Jersey native has a propensity toward swearing, making him . a bit of a liability for Romney, but he also has a knack for appealing . to middle class voters, with whom Romney has had a hard time connecting. At a campaign event for Romney in Iowa . last December, Christie bullied 'Occupy' protestors out of a rally, . leading Romney supporters to start chanting Christie's name as they . cheered with approval. 'You . know what, we’re used to dealing with jokers like this in New Jersey all . the time,' Christie shouted at the protesters as they were led out of . the rally by Romney staffers. 'So you guys go all out and chant and do . what it is that you want to do. 'You . are so angry, aren’t ya?' Christie  badgered. 'It’s so terrible... Oh . work it out. Work it all out for yourselves. Work it all out for . yourselves.' Scroll down for video . Quiet retaliation: Christie embraced President Obama this week during a tour of the wreckage in New Jersey from Hurricane Sandy, leading some to believe he was retaliating against Romney . Bipartisan courtship: 'We're both doing what we wanted to do, which is to get things done,' Christie said of Obama this week . In the end, it wasn’t Christie’s bombast that drove Romney away: It was his disregard for Romney as the man at the top of ticket. Christie would consistently arrive late at campaign events that he was attending on behalf of Romney and he would spend the majority of his speaking time on himself, not the Republican presidential candidate. Romney advisers began to think that Christie wouldn’t know how to be a ‘number two’ and they suddenly stopped vetting him without explanation just before Romney’s trip to Europe over the summer. When Romney returned, he offered the job to Ryan and waited another week to let Christie know, just shortly before announcing his pick publicly. Christie has since been quietly retaliating against the Romney campaign for his sudden fall from favor, political analysts say. Christie made news for his scarce mentions of Romney during his speech at the Republican National Convention. Campaigning: Chris Christie and Mitt Romney talking to voters in New Hampshire. Romney changed his mind about putting the New Jersey Governor on the Republican ticket . ‘His view was, “They saw the speech before I gave it. They vetted it. They said it was fine,”’ a Romney adviser told Politico. ‘And the campaign’s view was, “We told him that we thought there were more opportunities for him to put in stuff about Mitt, and he didn’t take the hint.” There was a lot of agitation that led to a lot of sarcasm and the kind of comments that people don’t mean, but they kind of do.’ Christie heaped praise on Obama after he was invited onto Air Force One to tour the wreckage left behind by the storm. ‘This was as comfortable and relaxed an interaction as I’ve had with the president since I’ve known him,’ Christie said. ‘And I think it’s ’cause we’re both doing what we wanted to do, which is to get things done.’ Christie said he expected to be criticized for complimenting the president. ‘But you know what, I speak the truth,’ he said. ‘That’s what I always do. Sometimes you guys like it, sometimes you don’t. Sometimes politicians like it, sometimes they don’t. But I say what I feel and what I believe. 'And I’m just doing the same thing with the president of the United States. So, I do pinch myself every day. You know, like when I got on Marine One? I’m pinching myself, believe me.’","He was miffed by the decision to dump him from the Republican ticket .

Saudi Arabian women will be forced to hide behind a screen when they take their place in the country's main advisory body. A Saudi official says a screen will separate men and women on the Shura Council, which advises King Abdullah, when women join it for the first time. King Abdullah made the decision to allow women to join the Shura Council, which is expected to reconvene early next year, but appears to be making a compromise with the nation's hardline Islamists, who oppose growing women's rights in the highly-segregated country. Segregated: Women who are now able to join the Shura Council, a council which advises Saudi King Abdullah, will be forced to do so from behind a screen . Abdullah has pledged to allow women to vote and run in the next municipal elections in 2015. But Saudi women still face many restrictions, including a ban on driving. The official, quoted in Al-Watan newspaper on Wednesday, says an internal communications network will allow men and women to communicate despite the barrier. King Abdullah has insituted a number of reforms to the strict rules governing women in the oil-rich kingdom. This summer Saudi women were allowed to compete in the Olympic Games for the first time. Olympic bosses said the country could be disqualified for gender discrimination after it appeared to block female athletes from taking part, but the country relented. Athlete: A number of reforms surrounding women have been made in the kingdom. Women athletes like Sarah Attar competed in the Olympics this summer . Saudi Arabia is also planning to build a new city exclusively for women as it bids to combine strict Sharia law and career minded females, pursuing work. It is thought the Saudi Industrial Property Authority has been asked to bring the country up to date with the rest of the modern world with the controversial city, which is now being designed with construction to begin next year. It is hoped it will allow women’s desire to work without defying the country’s Islamic laws.","Women will be forced to take place behind screen when in Shura Council .

Elderly patients are being shunted between hospital wards ‘like parcels’ because of a shortage of beds, say doctors who have warned the current system is on 'the brink of collapse'. Frail patients are frequently woken up in the night and made to walk to another department in their pyjamas because someone else needs their bed, a damning report has found. On occasions, they are also being discharged in the middle of the night and sent home in taxis just to make space on wards. Damning: Some elderly people are being discharged in the middle of the night and sent home in taxis just to make space on wards . The Royal College of Physicians claims that the number of hospital beds has fallen by a third in the last 25 years. Yet over the same time the number of seriously ill patients being admitted through accident and emergency departments has risen by more than 37 per cent. Care in hospitals is on ‘the brink of collapse’ due to a shortage of staff, beds and poor organisation, says the report published today. In particular, it warns that hospitals are failing to look after patients properly at evenings and weekends, with many senior doctors and staff just clocking on during office hours. Some doctors admit they feel ‘relieved’ if they return to the hospital on Monday morning and there have been no catastrophes over the weekend, when care is so shambolic. The college’s president, Sir Richard Thompson, said patients were being passed around ‘like parcels’ and ‘dominoes’. He added: ‘This is no way to run a health service. One doctor told me his trust does not function well at night or at the weekend and he is “relieved” that nothing catastrophic has happened when he arrives at work on Monday morning. Excellent care must be available to patients at all times of the day and night.’ He also said that it was not uncommon for elderly patients to be moved between wards five times during their stay because their beds were needed by more urgent cases. Often the elderly patients – many of whom have dementia – may initially be put on a specialist ward, for example treating liver problems or strokes, even if they do not suffer from that illness. Moved to free up space: The number of hospital beds has fallen by a third in the last 25 years, according to the Royal College of Physicians . This means that when another patient is brought in during the night who does need to be on that ward the person will be moved to free up the bed. Each time the confused, elderly patient is placed under the care of a new team of doctors and nurses, who are unfamiliar to their condition and needs. Additionally, the report said that hospital staff often see the elderly as ‘unwelcome’ and think they ‘shouldn’t be there’, even though they comprise two thirds of patients. Professor Tim Evans, one of the report’s authors who is also a consultant in intensive care medicine at the Royal Brompton hospital, in London, said: ‘This evidence is very distressing. It is increasingly clear that our hospitals are struggling to cope with the challenge of an ageing population with multiple, complex diseases.’ He warned that if steps were not taken to improve hospitals, there may be other scandals such as that which occurred at Mid Staffordshire NHS trust, where hundreds died due to poor care between 2005 and 2009. ‘There will not be some cataclysmic overnight explosion but there will be a gradual increase in the sorts of tragedies that we’ve heard about at Mid Staffs,’ he added. A spokesman for the Alzheimer’s Society said: ‘People with dementia occupy a quarter of hospital beds, yet constantly we hear that they face poor quality care from staff not trained in dementia care. ‘Bearing this in mind, these latest findings are alarming but, unfortunately, not surprising.’ Health minister Dr Dan Poulter said: ‘It is completely wrong to suggest that the NHS cannot cope - the NHS only uses approximately 85 per cent of the beds it has available, and more and more patients are being treated out of hospital, in the community or at home. ‘But it is true that the NHS needs fundamental reform to cope with the challenges of the future. To truly provide dignity in care for older people, we need to see even more care out of hospitals. That's why we are modernising the NHS and putting the people who best understand patient's needs, doctors and nurses, in charge.’","Elderly patients are being shunted between beds 'like parcels', the Royal College of Physicians says .

Waste: Many people simply throw away their old computers when they upgrade instead of recycling . Facebook has challenged the next generation of science whizz-kids to help solve one of the technology world's biggest ecological problems - by designing a computer made from cardboard. Rapid advances in modern technology mean every sleek new computer that hits the market is quickly usurped by a superior model, and servers are now typically replaced at least every four years. The social media giant wants students to help combat the mountain of discarded hardware by building a biodegradable server that can be flung on to the compost heap. Facebook set up its Open Compute project with the aim of designing affordable, eco-friendly servers, and now it has thrown down the gauntlet to students at Purdue University in the U.S. - a major research institution known for discoveries in technology and engineering - to come up with a design for a dissolvable server chassis. It is necessary to replace servers regularly in order to maintain a fast and reliable service. The housings are typically made from steel, which can be recycled, but the project aims to move toward an even more sustainable design made from entirely biodegradable materials, according to a report on businessinsider.com. If the project is a success it could see the creation of a computer server that will eventually break down entirely and decompose after it is discarded. Purdue students will spend time studying relevant research before splitting into teams to work on their proposals. Greener technology: Open Compute aims to design more eco-friendly servers . They will then present their ideas to judges and the winning team will receive funding and further support to build a prototype. Open Compute said of the ambitious project: 'We think there's enormous potential here, as servers are sometimes replaced as often as every two to three years. 'And even though the steel in those server chassis is usually recycled, we think it's worth exploring designs that retain the needed resiliency but push the boundaries of sustainability.' Earlier this year an Irish firm unveiled an environmentally-friendly PC made almost entirely from wood. The makers of the iameco computer went to great lengths to ensure every possible part of the PC could be recycled. Boasting a touch screen surrounded by a wooden frame, the team behind the award-winning model claim its carbon footprint is 70 per cent less than a conventional PC.

The Government has warned of the dangers of a potentially lethal fat-burning drug after it was linked to two recent deaths. The substance, called DNP, is sold as a weight loss aid, but has been described as 'extremely dangerous to human health' by doctors. The stark warning follows the death of a father who took the drug which he got at his local fitness centre. Sean Cleathero is believed to have taken the substance, which is sold as a weight loss aid. The 28-year-old from High Wycombe was taken ill shortly afterwards and died at Wycombe Hospital on October 17. His death is being investigated by Thames Valley Police. In a statement, his family said: 'Sean was very loved and popular. His death has come as a complete shock to his family and friends.  He was a fun, loving, caring son, grandson, brother and nephew. 'As a father, he leaves behind a three-year-old daughter who will carry on his infectious personality which made him so popular to all of his friends and those who knew him.' No information has been revealed about the second reported case. DNP is sold mostly over the internet under a number of different names but contains 2, 4-Dinitrophenol. It is marketed mainly to bodybuilders as a weight loss aid as it is thought to dramatically boost metabolism. The Food Standards Agency has told consumers not to take pills containing any level of DNP after a second death was linked to the substance. The manufactured drug is yellow and odourless and was previously used as a herbicide and fungicide. It was launched as a slimming aid in the U.S. in the 1930s but then banned in 1938, due to the severe side-effects. In a statement, the FSA said: . 'Depending on the amount consumed, signs of acute poisoning could . include nausea, vomiting, restlessness, flushed skin, sweating, . dizziness, headaches, rapid respiration and irregular heart-beat, . possibly leading to coma and death. 'Consuming . lower amounts over longer periods could lead to cataracts and skin . lesions and effects on the heart, blood and nervous system.' Anyone who thinks they may have taken DNP should seek medical advice immediately. According to a study published last year in the Journal of Medical Toxicity, in medical literature has attributed 62 deaths to DNP . The study authors from the Whittington Hospital in London, wrote: 'DNP is reported to cause rapid loss of weight, but unfortunately is associated with an unacceptably high rate of significant adverse effects.'

Apple has opened a broad new front its intellectual property war by patenting a rectangle with rounded corners. The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office issued a patent for the 'ornamental design for a portable display device' to the Cupertino, California-based tech giant this week. There have been claims in recent years, especially from Samsung, that Apple has sought to patent any conceivable oblong-shaped gadget. Rectangle with curved corners: Figure 1 of . patent no. D670,286. Dashed lines indicate features not covered. The solid line marking the edges of the device is the design for . which Apple now has exclusive rights . During the massive lawsuit battle between the two companies, Apple claimed that its rival had copied rounded corners on its own range of phones and tablets - as well as in the icons those devices displayed on screen. Responding to the allegations, the South Korean firm noted that it was 'unfortunate that patent law can be manipulated to give one company a monopoly over rectangles with rounded corners.' Well now, with the issue of patent no. D670,286, it appears Apple really has finally been granted intellectual ownership over the shape of objects as diverse tablet computers and slices of cheese. The D'286 patent granted on Tuesday includes a number of drawings of the original iPad design, with most of the identifying features shown in dashed lines. The patent description explains that 'broken lines in the Figures show portions of the portable display device which form no part of the claimed design'. The sole unbroken line in all the figures is the outline of the iPad's flat, rounded oblong front face. Apple originally filed the patent in December 2010, Wired reports - several months after the first iPad was originally unveiled - but it has only just been granted. As a design patent, it covers only the device's external appearance, which must by 'ornamental' and serve no practical function. Rectangular: The design of Apple's original iPad, left, has been at the heart of patent disputes between the California tech giant and its South Korean rival Samsung, whose Galaxy Tab machine is pictured right . Apple had originally asserted patent D504,889 against Samsung as part of its lawsuit claiming the smartphone rival had copied the iPhone and iPad design for its Galaxy S and Galaxy Tab devices. Samsung's Galaxy S3 has become the world's best-selling smartphone model for the last quarter, pushing aside Apple iPhone. Apple has dominated the chart for more than two years, research firm Strategy Analytics said. It claims Samsung sold 18 million S3 models in the third quarter, compared with iPhone 4S sales of 16.2 million. Strong sales of the flagship Galaxy S3 - which comes with a large 4.8 inch touchscreen - helped Samsung post a record $7.3billion operating profit in the July-September quarter. Apple customers were also believed to be waiting for the release of the iPhone 5, which is expected to propel Apple back to the top spot. After some to-ing and fro-ing a jury finally ruled that Samsung had not infringed that patent, which was awarded in 2005 and appears to be based on an earlier iPad prototype, but had infringed several others. Now the new patent appears to give Apple rights over the intellectual property that older patent was ruled not to. Legal experts have, however, argued that its uncertain whether this new patent would be of any use to the company in court. Lea Shaver, Associate Professor at Indiana University's McKinney School of Law, told Wired: 'This design patent gives Apple no new advantage, because no one is out there trying to market an iPad lookalike.' A commenter on arstechnica also explains that design patents are extremely narrow, with competitors having to do their 'level best' to replicate the design to infringe them. The commenter adds that almost every company with products of a distinctive shape applies for them, from Microsoft for its Xbox to LucasFilm for Yoda. Nevertheless, with the rectangular shape of the iPad being far from as distinctive as either of those two examples, it does seem that Apple really has patented the rectangle.",Patent finally granted to cover the design of Apple's original iPad .

Her shocking revelation comes as a man also scarred by the paedophile's legacy admitted he is haunted by the possibility he may be Savile's love child. The sick BBC star, who has now been exposed as one of the UK's most prolific abusers, had a fling with Mr Biven's mother when she was a teenager. Liz Dux, from law firm Slater & Gordon, said of the eight-year-old victim: 'This was a little girl who went in for treatment and came out an abuse victim. She should have been protected.' Savile was free to roam Stoke . Mandeville in Buckinghamshire as he pleased, using his position as a . charitable donor to sexually abuse sick children. He . kept toys donated for children in his private flat in the hospital . grounds, and was accused of attacking vulnerable young children on the . wards - with nurses advising them to 'pretend to be asleep' when he was . visiting. Solicitors have confirmed that they are planning to take legal action on behalf of 43 alleged victims, including a man and woman who were nine when they were attacked by Savile at the BBC. Slater & Gordon, which is acting for 36 people who were aged from eight to 23 when they were abused, has sent letters before action to the BBC, Leeds General Infirmary, Stoke Mandeville and Broadmoor hospitals, and the executors of Savile’s estate. Another law firm, Pannone, is acting on behalf of seven alleged victims and has sent letters of claim to Savile’s estate. One claim has also been made against the BBC.

Ms . Boothe, now 70, found she was pregnant after a relationship with Savile . when she was 18 and he was managing the Mecca Locarno dancehall in . Leeds. The former model and singer now believes she was cherry-picked for Savile by a bouncer. She and the bouncer went out for a drink and he stole a photo of her from her bag to show to his boss.

Ms Boothe added: 'It was always wham, bam, thank you ma'am. Being quick was the only good thing about him. 'Let's . be honest, I only went out with someone looking like he did because of . the people I could meet... the most famous was Cliff Richard.' Ms . Boothe, who is 'disgusted' to think that such a sick figure could be . the father of her child, described Savile as 'mean and arrogant.' A Tory councillor has called for Jimmy Savile’s corpse to be exhumed and cremated after complaints from people who have loved ones buried nearby in the cemetery. Colin Haddington spoke out as his civic colleagues voted unanimously to strike Savile’s name from Scarborough Council’s roll of honour and posthumously revoke his freedom of the Borough once the police investigation is over. Council leaders said there was no point in investigating the idea of an exhumation of the reviled entertainer because the decision on his final resting place is a matter for his family and the church authorities rather than the town hall. Savile is currently entombed in concrete in the resort’s Woodlands Cemetery, where he was buried at a 45 degree angle a year ago so he could 'see the sea'. His £4,000 triple headstone - with the final epitaph 'It was good while it lasted' - was removed and broken up for landfill at the request of the family. Councillor Haddington said: 'I have been contacted by one of my constituents whose granddaughter is buried close to Savile. 'This has caused her enormous concern and the family a great deal of distress. My constituent has asked me to put her family at ease - if the body could be exhumed, taken a short distance to the crematorium, and cremated. 'I would ask the council leader if he would in conjunction with the legal department look into this to see if it is possible.' Council leader Tom Fox described Savile’s behaviour as 'grotesque and obscene' but argued that it was not the council’s place to decide what happened to Savile’s remains, which was a matter for the family. He said: 'There was media speculation that the family may consider an exhumation. The family then said it was not part of their considerations. 'But it did prompt the council to consider how an exhumation could be done. 'Savile is interred in consecrated ground. If he is exhumed and put in another consecrated area the church diocese will need to give permission and consent given to where he goes. 'The grave owner then needs to give permission and the local authority is then last in line to give its permission.' Similar consent would be needed even if Savile was reinterred in non-consecrated ground, he added. There are also the options of cremation and disposing of the remains at sea. She . said: 'He'd take me to restaurants with his entourage and stuff his . face with fast food. But he'd say to the waitresses, ""A coffee for the . lady."" I spent most of the time with him starving.' She . did see a darker side to his lifestyle, however, and claims Savile . regularly met with police and gangsters and even ordered an arson attack . on heavyweight boxer Bruce Woodcock. 'He wasn't a nice person,' she added - although she said she never knew of any paedophilia. After she broke up with Savile, she was called to his office, where he asked if she was really pregnant and if the baby was his. She did not want it to be, she said, so she told him that it was not. He replied: 'Thank god for that.' Father-of-two Mr Biven, who looks remarkably like Savile, now has to live with the knowledge that a predatory paedophile could be his father. Mr Biven has only blank space on his birth certificate where his father's name should be, but he and his mother never want to know the truth. 'It's best left,' said Ms Boothe. 'I'm sure there are loads who had babies by Sav.' Savile’s name is to be wiped from Scarborough’s list of Freemen of the Borough as a gesture of support to his 300 alleged victims, who he is said to have abused over six decades. The disgraced BBC star was awarded the accolade in 2005 to celebrate his links with the North Yorkshire resort, where he owned a second home and was buried overlooking the sea a year ago. Councillor Tom Fox, who proposed the motion, said: 'This council wishes to send its heartfelt support to, and acknowledge the courage of, those who have come forward having suffered horrendous abuse at the hands of the alleged serial predatory sexual offender Sir Jimmy Savile.' The Savile scandal began when ITV broadcast new sex abuse allegations in a documentary about the late presenter on October 3, sparking a mammoth police inquiry. Intense scrutiny of the BBC followed, after the corporation dropped a Newsnight report into the presenter’s actions last year after his death. Comedian Freddie Starr and former pop star Gary Glitter, whose real name is Paul Gadd, have also been questioned by officers investigating the abuse scandal. Doctors at Leeds Infirmary as well as Stoke Mandeville at the time are accused of collaborating in Savile's rape of children. Others claim they were abused by Savile while pupils at Duncroft Approved School in Surrey during the 1970s. Savile's estate has been frozen in response to the allegations. NatWest Bank, which is acting as his executor and trustee, said the distribution of his assets had been put on hold in anticipation of legal action from his alleged victims. Savile was also a regular visitor to Broadmoor psychiatric hospital and befriended Yorkshire Ripper Peter Sutcliffe, now 66. Britain’s top expert on serial killers said police should probe whether the pair developed a friendship before Sutcliffe was caught.","Woman says she was abused while in hospital recovering from operation .

Samsung will today launch its flagship smartphone, taking the fight to Apple with the most pre-ordered gadget in history. And while all eyes are on the launch of Samsung's hardware, the Korean tech giant launched another salvo against Apple with a competitor to the iPhone's long-established iTunes media store. The Galaxy S3 is the successor to the S2 Android phone, which helped make Samsung the world's largest smartphone maker in 2011. The phone, sporting a 4.8-inch screen, features eye-tracking technology so that it knows when to wake and when to sleep, and quad-core processors which give it the kind of computing power top-range PCs had just a few years ago. It also comes with Samsung's take on Apple's 'Siri' voice control system, and 50GB of cloud storage thanks to a hook-up with the file-sharing service DropBox. Scroll down for video . The Galaxy S3 is the successor to the S2 Android phone, which helped make Samsung the world's largest smartphone maker in 2011 . Samsung has today officially announced the iTunes rival, a Music Hub allows users to upload music to the cloud and access it from a PC and up to five mobile devices. First look at the Music Hub centre for the S3 phone . T.J. Kang, senior vice president for Samsung's media department, said: 'Samsung is not known for our content services; we make good hardware products but we haven't done much in the content space but that's changing. 'We are doing it to create a better experience for our users. There are things we could do better if we have complete control over all of the service.' Speaking to expert mobile site Pocket-Lint, he said: 'We want to have the largest catalogue. We want to be bigger than Apple.' The company has previously rebranded existing music and video services on its devices, where they compete with music stores from the likes of Google and Amazon and streaming services such as Spotify and Pandora Media. Fred Huet at Greenwich Consulting said the mobile phone was increasingly at the heart of a lot more media consumption, and Apple had established a formidable lead. 'A lot of the other players are still trying to find the magic formula that can use to counter iTunes,' he said. Critics have raved about the model, calling it 'light years' ahead of the nine-month-old iPhone. A spokesman for Vodafone UK said: 'In the two years that we've been offering pre-orders, it's the . Samsung sold 44.5 million smartphones in January to March - equal to nearly 21,000 every hour - giving it 30.6 percent market share. Apple sold 35.1 million iPhones, taking 24.1 percent market share. 'The Galaxy S3 is a real challenger to the upcoming iPhone,' said Francisco Jeronimo, an IDC analyst based in London. 'This is likely be one of the most sold smartphones this year, though the real test will come when the next iPhone is launched.' iTunes is the entrenched champion of media distribution, with deals with all the major content labels to let people get movies, TV and music on to their iDevices. iTunes currently has 20million tracks available to download - but Samsung have done a good job at catching up, with 19million traks available. Both devices allow you to purchase tracks at a range of prices, but in terms of the 'all you can eat' offers, Samsung allows you to pay £9.99 a month to stream music over the air, and download tracks for offline use. It also offers 100gb of personal space where you can upload tracks you own which are not on Samsung's platform. But iTunes' 'all-you-can-eat' model comes in a lot cheaper, at less than £25 for a year's worth of streaming - although without offline access. However, as a first release, this is an interesting and well-considered development for Samsung. iTunes is both much-loved and much-hated. Loved for its ease of use, but users often complain that they are locked into Apple's eco-system, and struggle to get non-Apple-purchased material onto their iDevices. Music Hub is so far only available on the S3, but Samsung says it will be rolled out to other Samsung devices - including their brand of Smart TVs. If Samsung gets a critical mass of supporters, it will be interesting to see long-term how this matches up to Android's generally 'open-access' philosophy, and whether Music Hub will eventually be accessible from other Android devices - and how other manufacturers such HTC, which has its own fledgling HTC Music store, will respond. The race for global smartphone supremacy comes as Apple has accused Samsung of copying some of its products. The South Korean company counter-claims that Apple has infringed its patents. Both have denied the allegations, and a long-running court saga continues. Apple plans to use a larger screen on the next iPhone, according to people familiar with the situation. The current iPhone 4S model was introduced last October. Reviewers have praised the Samsung Galaxy S3 as the best phone on the market, outclassing its competitors - and even beating the iPhone at its own game. TechRadar said 'if you're picking up an iPhone 4S: forget it' and Trusted Reviews concluded 'the S3 is light years ahead of Apple's profitable darling'. And Stuff Magazine said the S3 has succeeded in 'toppling Apple's ageing starlet'. In fairness to Apple, their latest phone is now nearly nine months old - a lifetime in the fast-moving mobile world. The next iPhone is rumoured to arrive in October at the earliest - but Apple are notoriously secretive.",Samsung on 'Music Hub': 'We want to be bigger than Apple'

Middle-aged women who had taken the Pill for just five years still performed better on cognitive tests than those who had never taken it . The contraceptive Pill could prevent women getting dementia years after they have stopped taking it, according to research. Women in their 50s who had been on the drug when they were younger performed far better in memory tests than those who had never taken it. Experts think that the key hormone in the Pill, oestrogen, prevents the arteries hardening, which increases the blood supply to the brain, helping stave off the illness. For some years scientists have known that HRT, which also contains oestrogen, seems to protect against dementia. But little was known about the potential benefits of the Pill. American scientists looked at 261 women aged 40 to 65 who were surveyed on their health. They underwent a series of tests on their memory, including naming  certain objects and listing as many words as they could on a given subject. Researchers from the University of Wisconsin found that women who had taken the Pill performed significantly better in some of the tests. They also found that the longer the women had been on the Pill, the higher their scores. Although the study did not directly look at the risks of  dementia, adults whose brains  are sharper in middle age are thought to be far less at risk of the illness. Experts think that oestrogen, the main hormone in the Pill, helps maintain the function of the brain in two ways. Firstly, they believe it prevents the arteries from becoming blocked, which keeps a steady flow of blood to the brain. They also suspect it may encourage the growth of certain cells in the brain and spinal cord. Lead researcher Kelly Egan, whose study is published in  the Journal of Women’s Health, said: ‘Our analysis indicated  that hormonal contraceptive use may have a protective cognitive  [memory] effect, even years after use is discontinued. This is especially true in subjects with a longer duration of use.’ While the contraceptive Pill has been shown to protect against some cancers such as ovarian and bowel, it is thought to raise the risk of breast tumours.","Middle-aged women who had taken the Pill for five years still performed better on cognitive tests compared to those who hadn't .

A mistake by an NYPD employee was to blame for the sensational DNA connection between the murder of Sarah Fox and the Occupy Wall Street movement, dashing hopes that after eight years her killer might finally be brought to justice. It was originally thought that DNA found on a padlock chain dropped during an OWS protest this year matched that discovered at the 2004 murder scene of the aspiring Julliard actress. However it is now believed that a worker at either the police crime lab or Medical Examiner's office, who handled evidence in both cases, botched the job. Scroll down for video . False connection: Botched DNA evidence on a chain used in a protest by Occupy Wall Street activists this year had been linked to that found at the murder scene of a young actress in 2004 . Sarah Fox, 21, was dragged from a running path in a Manhattan park in broad daylight on May 19, 2004 and strangled. Several days later, her naked body was discovered in woodland with tulip petals arranged around it. Although there was DNA found on her pink CD player nearby, Miss Fox's killer has never been found. On March 28 this year, Occupy Wall Street protesters poured into the Beverly Road subway station in East Flatbush, Brooklyn. They chained open emergency gates, taped up turnstiles and posted fliers, encouraging passengers to ride for free. The chain was left behind when the activists fled the station following the demonstration. Police made no arrests following the incidents. The subway stop protest was made up of mainly OWS supporters along with workers from the Transport Workers Union Local 100 and the Amalgated Transit Union.

CSI: The path at Inwood Hill Park in Manhattan where Miss Fox was strangled in 2004 . NYPD investigators announced earlier this week that crime scene DNA from Miss Fox's murder matched that found in the New York subway station only months ago. However it has now been revealed that the potential clue was tainted evidence - embarrassing the NYPD and enraging the OWS movement who took the opportunity to say the police should have made better use of their resources than collecting their DNA. The only suspect in the Fox murder case was Dimitry Sheinman, 47, who has since moved to South Africa. He was never charged in connection with the murder of the young actress. Sheinman returned to the U.S. last month, to share information he had received from a psychic as to who really killed the young woman. He remains a suspect but has penned a book about his experiences. Miss Fox was a promising student studying at the prestigious Julliard School of performing arts at the time of her death.

Dementia is as much of a taboo as cancer was in the 1960s, according to the Health Secretary. One in three adults will develop the illness but we ‘just don’t like talking about it’, Jeremy Hunt said yesterday. He admitted that the way society deals with dementia is ‘shockingly bad’, adding: ‘We need to change attitudes.’ The Prime Minister and Health secretary Jeremy Hunt (right) have pledged their support for dementia sufferers . It came as Prime Minister David . Cameron announced plans for a £2.4million project to train a million . volunteers to spot the illness and care for patients. About 800,000 Britons are being treated for dementia. Another 400,000 are thought to suffer from it but have not been diagnosed. Mr Hunt said one reason diagnosis rates are so low is people ‘don’t want to come forward’ to see their GP. He added: ‘The way we deal with it is . as a society is shockingly bad. We need to sort out what we do inside . the NHS as there’s some big work we are doing on that front. And we need . to improve research. ‘Dementia is a bit of a taboo. It’s a bit like cancer in the 1960s where people don’t like to talk about it.’ He said: 'The NHS is brilliant in so many ways, but I think even inside the NHS people realise we have to do a lot better. 'Too many people with dementia feel cut off, lonely and fearful without the support and understanding they need. Mr Cameron told ITV's This Morning it was 'vital to put more money into dementia research' 'We . need to build a society where people can live well with dementia, . enjoying the best possible quality of life for as long as possible. I . want Britain to be one of the best places to be for dementia care.' Pledging to make the issue a . 'personal priority', David Cameron unveiled a package of initiatives, . saying urgent action is needed to raise the 'shockingly low' awareness . of the condition and improve diagnosis rates. One . million 'dementia friends' are to be trained to spot the symptoms of . the condition and given advice on how to provide practical help to . Britain's estimated 700,000 sufferers. Mr Cameron told ITV1’s This Morning: 'Six months ago, I set up this challenge to say we’ve got to do better as a country in three vital regards. 'First is how do we treat people with dementia in the health service, in care homes? In some cases it’s brilliant, in many cases it’s not good enough, and remember one in four hospital beds are occupied by someone with dementia. 'What more can we do in society to show understanding for people with dementia and make sure we treat them properly? 'Third, but I think almost the most vital, is putting more money into dementia research. About 80,000 Britons are currently being treated for dementia (file picture) 'I think there a lot of people out there who think dementia is just part of ageing, part of getting old. It isn’t. It’s a disease of the brain. We’ve got about 670,000 people with dementia, but tragically only 40 per cent - less than half - know they’ve got it. 'We are not diagnosing it fast enough, we are not treating it fast enough. But there’s a really big cultural change we need to make. We know cancer is a killer that we want to get on top of. 'We need to think of dementia in the same way. This is a disease that we need to try and tackle with all our brains and brilliant scientists.' Mr Cameron has described Dementia Friends as 'a great initiative' which would make Britain 'a country that’s more friendly and more understanding' to people with the illness. Hailing the extra £10 million for dementia research, the PM added: “We can do amazing things in our world. We can crack killer diseases. We can save lives on the other side of the world. We should be doing more here at home on this subject. 'I think there are signs that if you diagnose it earlier there are better chances of drugs working, and the tragedy at the moment is that, with almost three quarters of a million people with dementia, less than half of those have actually been diagnosed. Mr Cameron told This Morning that Dementia Friends is a 'great initiative' Get to them faster, research the drugs, and let’s try and crack this disease, which tragically is going to affect one million people soon in our country.' 'Through the Dementia Friends project we will for the first time make sure a million people know how to spot those tell-tale signs and provide support.' The Dementia Friends initiative, which will receive £2.4 million funding over the next three years, is based on a scheme in japan where three million members of the public have been recruited to help dementia sufferers. It will be led by the Alzheimer's Society, which is recruiting up to 8,000 volunteers to help train members of the public. Members of the public will then be offered one-hour training sessions in community centres, church halls and workplaces designed to help them understand the impact of the disease and offer them practical ways to help sufferers. In one exercise they will be asked to write down all the steps involved in making a cup of tea, in order to demonstrate how complicated even simple tasks can be. Those taking part will be encouraged to wear a specially-designed badge, based on a forget-me-not, identifying them as a Dementia Friend. They will also be encouraged to help sufferers they know or who they see struggling to cope with everyday tasks. Dementia sufferers will be told to look out for people wearing the badges if they need help. Some 17,000 bus drivers at the transport giant First Group will be among the first to take part in the scheme. Jeremy Hughes, chief executive of the Alzheimer's Society, said: 'Day to day tasks such as going to the shop or catching a bus can become increasingly difficult for people with dementia. Without a helping hand, this can mean people are left feeling isolated, unable to be part of their community and in some cases even unable to continue living at home. 'We want to rally a million people behind the cause of helping make a better life for people with dementia. 'I am confident we will not only meet this target but beat it.' Mr Cameron will also announce that the Government is providing almost £10 million for dementia research to study brain scans of people in middle age, and £50 million to make wards and care homes more comfortable for people with dementia. He also announced other initiatives to boost early diagnosis and help the public to better understand the condition which is forecast to affect one in three people aged over 65. At present just 42 per cent of people with the condition are ever diagnosed. GPs are being given new guidance on the need to refer people displaying symptoms of the condition for specialist diagnosis .","Jeremy Hunt said NHS must do more to help dementia patients .

Taxpayers are forking out £113million a year to fund the trade union activities of thousands of civil servants. This amounted to £92million in paid staff time in the last year, according to research by the TaxPayers’ Alliance, along with a further £21million in direct payments to unions. The staff figure is the equivalent of 3,000 public sector employees working full-time for trade unions, in what campaigners described as a ‘scandalous subsidy’. Local government minister Brandon Lewis described the bankrolling of trade union activity under the Labour government as 'a very unsubtle way of subsidising Ed Miliband (pictured) and the Labour party' The £21million is largely paid to train staff for union work through the Union Learning Fund. The biggest spender is the Department for Work and Pensions, which shelled out £15.5million to the fund. The research, published today, suggests that the proportion of public staff working for trade unions may be rising at a time when strikes have crippled public services. Union duties can include discussing issues such as redundancy and pay or attending activist meetings to organise strikes. The Department for Work and Pensions had the highest number of staff doing union work in the last year, with the equivalent of 272 staff working full-time for trade unions. HMRC had the second highest number with 169 full-time equivalent staff. Cabinet Office minister Francis Maude said that 'trade union facility time arrangements in the Civil Service should reflect those in business and the wider public sector' Birmingham City Council had 70 full-time equivalent staff, the highest figure for a local authority. A planned crackdown by the Cabinet Office on ‘facility time’ had to go further than Whitehall and its quangos, the TaxPayers’ Alliance said. Spokesman Matthew Sinclair said: ‘Thousands of staff who should be working for public services are working for the trade unions instead. Managers at too many public sector organisations are completely failing in their responsibility to control these costs.’ Local government minister Brandon Lewis said: ‘Under Labour millions were taken away from frontline services to bankroll trade union cronies in councils. ‘It was a very unsubtle way of subsidising Ed Miliband and the Labour party through the back door. We are calling time on this closed shop and stopping these non-jobs.’ Cabinet Office Minister Francis Maude said: ‘We recognise that trade unions play an important role in the modern workplace. But we think trade union facility time arrangements in the Civil Service should reflect those in business and the wider public sector. ‘For too long there has been insufficient monitoring of union work done by civil servants during their working hours. And some civil servants were able to spend years doing nothing but trade union work. That isn’t fair to the taxpayer or other civil servants. ‘That’s why we are limiting the amount of time civil servants can spend on trade union work and introducing a benchmark which will slash the cost of facility time to the taxpayer. Any exemptions to these arrangements will be reported for all to see and scrutinise.’","Research by the TaxPayers' Alliance revealed that £93million in paid staff time funded union activities .

As they scrolled through the story, however, their hearts sank again as they learned that city officials ordered the largely-undamaged bar to be smashed to pieces to make room for the ongoing clean-up effort. Initially, local residents believed that the bar that mysteriously ended up in the middle of Madoc Street was a part of the Sugar Bowl, a famed watering hole from Breezy Point, Brooklyn. Though the journey would have been incredible- as the bar would have floated seven miles- the patrons believed it was a tiny gift amid a day full of destruction. In keeping with that belief, a group of men looking for a moment of distraction took over the bar and turned it into their own, dubbing it Sandy's Bar in the hurricane's honor. Former home: The bar normally floats off a dock in the Gateway Marina in Brooklyn . Rising sea level: Owner Louis Kallif believes that because their marina was only met by a sea surge- rather than a high wave- the bar was able to stay intact and just float on top of the water . 'We were so excited to see that the bar made it, and We were happy people that had nothing they were able to have some moments of comfort and joy in the devastation,' Debbie Kallif told MailOnline a week after the hurricane hit. Her husband and co-owner agreed, saying that they were not upset to see the strangers taking over their bar but just happy to see it was being used as they intended. 'I thought ""Oh look, there's people partying on board, that’s great!""' he said. 'I don’t mind people partying on it- we’ve had plenty of parties there through the years.' Intact: The building's interior remained in remarkably good condition despite the extraordinary journey . Venue: Gerritsen Beach resident Lawrence Lowey enjoys a beer in the abandoned bar which turned up in the middle of his street . Normal service: Louis Kallif said that the bar was only open at the marina from April to October, so they had emptied it of all food and booze before it was swept away by Sandy . What they did mind, however, was the . fact that as they read on, they learned that the police had brought a . crane to break the floating bar apart in order to streamline the . recovery process for the damaged properties nearby. Though . she said that the bar normally has the couple's liquor license tacked . to the wall, which lists the owners names and contact information, . Debbie confirmed that they were never contacted by police about the . decision to break it to pieces. 'If it was someone's boat, they weren't going to just trash it,' she said. The floating bar had lasted a number of years- and storms- before it met its match in the police bulldozer. Party time: Residents of Gerritsen Beach, Brooklyn, hooked up a generator and brought their own drinks to the bar, using it as a way to escape the destruction around them . Having a drink: The bar owner said that the bar was not stocked because it was only opened seasonally and he cleared out all liquor when he closed it to the public in October . Unexpected pleasure: Gerritsen Beach resident . Lawrence Lowey takes a drink in the displaced bar (left) and another . neighbor uses it as a place to cut loose on one of the darkest of days . (right) Louis Kallif said that the floating . structure has been around the Gateway Marina for around 30 years, . serving as an office and a bait and tackle shop at different points of . time. It's most drastic . change came in the months following the September 11th attacks when the . FDNY used it as the headquarters for their Marine 3 fire boat unit that . serviced nearby Jamaica Bay. The fire department returned the structure to the Kallifs, who run the Gateway Marina as part of a contract with the government who owns the national park land where the marina is located, about four years ago. Renamed: The revellers called the bar 'Sandy's Bar' after the superstorm and marked 'BYOB' on the side of it to instruct guests to bring their own bottles when the drink ran out... ...but the fun couldn't last forever, and the police ordered for the bar to be demolished and cleared away . Condemned: The digger reduces the venue to a pile of debris under police direction . At that time, they decided to return . the building to the water and use it as a seasonal bar for patrons who . rent out some of the marina's 500 boat slips. Mr . Kallif said that the residents of Gerritsen Beach were clearly looking . for a place to party when they found the bar, because he said it was . empty of any liquor when it left the Marina moorings. ‘There wasn’t any alcohol on that . because it’s a seasonal bar that closes in October- everyone brought . their own alcohol, so no one stole anything or anything like that,’ he . said. And party they did, . as pictures show a number of men taking swigs directly from rum, gin, . vodka and tequila bottles inside the bar. ¿Our damage was basically from storm surge the docks floated up and floated above the pilings that they rest on, so they floated back down slightly differently,' Mr Kallif said . By the numbers: The Kallifs said that of Gateway Marina's 500 slips, only a couple dozen were damaged . In spite of everything, the Kallifs . consider themselves lucky even though their marina is still without . power or phone service, and their Long Island home just got electricity . back Thursday. Because their marina was hit mostly . by a storm swell rather than a large wave, only a couple dozen of . their 500 slips were really damaged. ‘It’s not bad,’ Mr Kallif said. ‘Our damage was basically from storm surge the docks floated up and floated above the pilings that they rest on, so they floated back down slightly differently but they didn’t break. We were really, really lucky.’ On top of the damage that they are dealing with at the marina, they don’t know where to start in terms of picking up whatever pieces remain from their bar in Gerritsen Beach. Fun over: Partygoer Michael Farrell stands in front of the debris after police ordered for the bar to be demolished . ‘I haven’t called the police or anyone, first because I don’t have service down by the marina still but also because I have no idea who to call,’ Mrs Kallif said. The shock of having been a part of a Wizard of Oz-like storyline amidst the destruction of the hurricane seems to still be sinking in, but for now their priorities lie elsewhere. ‘I have no idea what we’re going to do about the bar,’ Mr Kallif told MailOnline. ‘I liked it. Maybe one day I’ll build another one but I’m not even thinking about it right now.’","A floating bar that was used at the Gateway Marina in Brooklyn ended up in the middle of a neighborhood street in Gerritsen Beach after Sandy .

First Lady: Ieng Thirith, pictured in court in 2008, has been released on health grounds . Cambodia’s war crimes court has ordered that Ieng Thirith, the 80-year-old sister-in-law of brutal Khmer Rouge leader Pol Pot, should no longer face the accusations of war crimes because she is seen to be unfit to stand trial. The UN-backed tribunal said in a statement today that there was no prospect the accused woman could be tried in the foreseeable future. Her release from what would have been penetrating questions about any role or support she gave to Pol Pot’s mass-murder regime from 1975 to 1979 came after health experts said she was suffering from a form of dementia and memory loss and her ‘cognitive impairment is likely irreversible.’ Yet the conclusion of experts working for the prosecution contrasted sharply with testimony from Ieng Thirith’s psychiatrist, Chak Thida, who has told the court that her patient did not have the symptoms of dementia. Miss Thida said Ieng Thirith was a ‘polite and neat' lady who could read French accurately, although she did experience ‘some loss in memory’ due to her age. Ieng Thirith, who is married to former foreign minister Ieng Sary, was accused of war crimes, genocide and crimes against humanity for her role in ‘Brother Number One’ Pol Pot’s communist regime, during which an estimated two million Cambodians were killed. The goal of the Khmer Rouge regime was to create a communist utopia through social engineering, and saw million of people forced out of their homes in cities and towns to work in fields in the countryside. The country was re-named Democratic . Kampuchea and during the four years of Khmer Rouge's reign, Cambodians died of starvation and . torture at the hands of brutal ‘re-education’ guards as they were forced . to work in fields, or were tortured and executed in prison camps.

In a bid to make all Cambodians equal, . the regime slaughtered intellectuals, professionals, foreigners and . artists who were all seen as 'enemies' of Democratic Kampuchea. Accused: Cambodia's former Foreign Minister Ieng Sary, and husband of Ieng Thirith . Three elderly former regime leaders remain on trial: Former prime minister Nuon Chea, also known as ‘Brother Number Two’ , former head of state Khieu Samphan and Ieng Thirith’s husband Ieng Sary. Although released, Ieng Tirith has been warned by the prosecution not to interfere in the investigation and to remain in the country. As recently as last November judges announced that Ieng Tirith should be released, however that ruling was overturned on appeal the following month. Medical experts working for the prosecution said her mental state had since declined – opinions that were not shared by her psychiatrist.

When the New Victoria first opened its doors to the public in the heart of Bradford in 1930, the magnificent Art Deco building was one of the largest cinemas in the country, with an auditorium that could seat 3,000 people. Featuring a grand ballroom, restaurant and tea room - all in the same lavish style - the landmark building went on to become the thriving hub of entertainment in the industrial city in Yorkshire, screening films from the Golden Age of Hollywood and going on to host The Beatles and The Rolling Stones during the 1960s. More than 80 years on, pictures from inside the now derelict Bradford Odeon - whose owner has offered to sell it to Bradford City Council for just £1 -  reveal waterlogged carpets in the deserted lobby that was once thronged with people, and damp creeping across the walls of the formerly sumptuous auditorium. Faded glory: The Bradford Odeon closed its doors for the last time in 2000. The owners of the landmark building have offered to sell it to the council for the nominal fee of £1 . Deserted: Where once the auditorium inside the building would have housed hundreds of people, today it is dilapidated and deserted . A source of huge civic pride in Bradford, the 1930s edifice boasted an imposing exterior and lavishly fitted interior that would have been far removed from the usual surroundings of many of its patrons. In September 1950 the building was renamed The Gaumont and began hosting concerts and stage shows, welcoming famous names from Billy Haley and The Comets to The Beatles during the 1960s. While the lofty auditorium and plush lobby drew crowds of film fans and music lovers for a large chunk of the 20th Century, the historic picture house eventually lost its battle with multiplexes luring the city's young people with the offer of a greater choice of film titles on an array of vast screens. The venue, by then known as the Bradford Odeon, finally closed its doors to the public in 2000, much to the regret of the local community who over the years had taken the Art Deco building to their hearts. The cinema has now been deserted for more than a decade, and these photographs, posted on Flickr, reveal the faded glory of the building that was for many years at the heart of Bradford's social scene.

"Alison Kemp is 8 years older than her partner as was constantly mistaken for his mother . She spent £5,550 on facelift and lower eye surgery to change her looks . Also had Botox and fillers and is planning another facelift . People now think she is younger than him . By . Bianca London . PUBLISHED: . 11:30 EST, 13 November 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 12:55 EST, 13 November 2012 . A woman who suffered years of humiliation of being mistaken for her lover’s mother decided to get a face lift to ensure that nobody ever made the same embarrassing mistake again. Alison Kemp, 57, spent £5,500 on a facelift and upper and lower eye surgery to change her looks. Now the financial advisor from Leedstown, Cornwall is planning more surgery to keep her looking as fresh faced as her partner Michael who is eight years her junior. Before and after: Alison Kemp, pictured (L) age 54 in 2009, was fed up of being mistaken for her partner's mother so underwent a £5,500 facelift (R) aged 57 she feels much younger . Alison said: ‘There is nothing more embarrassing or hurtful than being mistaken for your partner’s mother. I’m not a vain person but it left me utterly distraught and destroyed my confidence. 'It was so humiliating and hurtful that I even considered ending my relationship because I couldn’t face the thought of it keep happening. But Mike is wonderful so I instead I decided to get rid of the lines and jowls and it was the best thing I ever did. 'Since having the surgery some people have assumed I’m younger than him which is quite funny and certainly a compliment. 'But I don’t want to risk ever being mistaken for his mother again so I’m planning more surgery just to be sure.' Alison says she first noticed her skin aging prematurely in her thirties. She said: 'My cheeks were sagging and I already had lots of lines but I didn’t worry about them. I’ve always been an outdoors person and never cared too much for my appearance.’ She met Mike soon after through friends. ‘The eight year age gap didn’t bother me at all. He was great fun and that’s all I thought about. We didn’t notice an age gap and neither I thought did other people.’ It was only as the years passed that Alison noticed that the age gap begin to show. Alison was fed up of being mistaken for Mike's mother- he is eight years her junior- and people often commented on the mismatch . One such incident occurred during a romantic hotel break with Mike, when she was aged just 42. ‘We’d had a lovely evening and started chatting to another couple at the bar. When I mentioned feeling peckish they asked Mike if he and his mum wanted to join them. ‘It took a few seconds to realise they were talking about me. I’d was gobsmacked and quickly made my excuses and fled back to our room in tears. ‘It ruined our weekend away but I hoped it was just a one off and tried to forget about it.’ Only a year on the couple were enjoying a night out in a bar struggling to get served when another drinker stood aside and kindly offered Mike the space for his mother, pointing to humiliated Alison. She says: ‘I couldn’t believe it had happened again. We both just smiled and went along with it to save any further embarrassment but of course inside I was devastated.’ Mike did his best to assure Alison he found her as desirable and attractive as he had always done but her confidence was crumbling. Since her surgery, people think she is younger than him which she loves. She is even planning for operation number two to ensure that it stays that way . ‘My job means I attend lots of meetings and I started to take more time with my hair and make up. But it never made any difference.’ More humiliation followed when Alison joined Mike for a work night out, only for a colleague to ask who had brought their mother along. Alison said: 'This time Mike jumped to my defence and demanded an apology but it was too late, the damage was done and I left in tears.' 'We’d always had such a wonderful relationship but I even considered ending it because I couldn’t face the humiliation of people mistaking me for his mum. ‘I felt young inside but clearly the outside didn’t match. I decided to look into cosmetic surgery.’ A few weeks later in 2009 she booked a full facelift with upper and lower eye surgery in Cyprus costing £5,500. Alison spent a staggering £5,500 on her facelift and also had Botox and fillers to enhance her look . She said: 'When I left for the airport Mike admitted he was worried he wouldn’t recognise me when I came back. 'I told him I hoped he didn’t or it would have been a waste of money.’ Days after arriving with a friend for moral support she underwent the four hour operation. ‘I looked like I had been run over by a bus when I came round but it didn’t really hurt and just hours after coming round I was sitting on my balcony having a gin and tonic, it was wonderful,’ she added. As soon as the swelling started to reside Alison says she noticed a huge difference. A week later in April 2010 she flew home after having her hair restyled and coloured and having Botox and fillers to smooth out the remaining lines. As soon as the swelling started to go down, Alison noticed the difference and immediately felt much more confident . ‘Mike told me I looked fantastic and for the first time ever I believed him. ‘I know he’s always loved me but my improved confidence has definitely improved our relationship,' she said. Last year Alison saw a British surgeon for more Botox and fillers and is now planning a second facelift. Though she has not been mistaken for Mike’s mother since her surgery Alison is determined to prevent it ever happening again by having another facelift. ‘I think of myself like a car, I need regular maintenance so am planning another procedure soon. Mike supports me, he just wants me to be happy. ‘I’m 57 but I’m often mistaken for someone in their forties. It certainly beats being mistaken for your partner’s mother.’","Alison Kemp is 8 years older than her partner as was constantly mistaken for his mother .

Jennine had her last operation in 2011 and says now that she is officially a woman, she has never been happier with her life. She has even set up her own business specialising in tyre repairs, inspired by her time spent in the army. The ex-squaddie, who grew up in Burnley, Lancashire, but now lives in Darlington, County Durham, said: 'From a young age I always knew I was different. 'But it was the 1980s and where I came from you got strung up even if you were gay. 'There wasn’t the same help and information there is today. The young squaddie knew he was different from a young age but attempted to suppress his feelings . 'I was not happy with who I was but I did the opposite of what I wanted to do. I tried to become a man. 'It was also the middle of the Thatcher-era, there were no jobs and I had a difficult home life. I needed to get out.' Russell had been withdrawn at school, knowing that he was different from everyone else and was bullied by other children because he was small for his age and wore glasses. Not getting on with his family, who he is still estranged from, he was eager to leave home. Aged just 16, Russell threw himself into army life and quickly got promoted, but he never felt as though he belonged. Russell was bullied by other children at school because he was small for his age and wore glasses . She added: 'I had always found it difficult in the army. Some of the lads had massive groups of friends, but I never did. 'I just stuck to a few acquaintances, not wanting to get too close to anyone. 'But . so much was going on, I managed to push my feelings to the back of my . mind. It was a very macho, back-slapping kind of environment with a lot . of drinking in the bar and towards the end I felt as though I was . putting on an act all the time. 'There was pressure to behave like the rest of them, and to be a man. 'After I got promoted I tried hard just to get on with things, I was high-up so I gave orders and didn’t mix that much with the other lads.' Russell was discharged due to an eye infection in 2005 having reached the position of quartermaster sergeant at Catterick Garrison, North Yorkshire. In his last few years of his career, he had established the armoured vehicle fleet at Catterick where he was in command of 72 vehicles and their drivers. But the infection had left him needing a corneal transplant and as a result his sight was permanently impaired, meaning he was no longer fit for service. It was then that Russell seriously started thinking about having a sex change. He had never discussed his feelings with anyone before but that same year he visited his GP and was diagnosed with gender dysphoria. Jennine then started having counselling and taking hormone tablets at the start of a six-year process. She funded the sex change herself, forking out £4,000 for a boob job but says she encountered prejudice along the way. While she was going through the transition neighbours she had told were supportive but some locals vandalised her car and house. Throughout his time in the armed forces, the . desire to become a woman never left him and when he was discharged from . the army in 2005 he finally embarked upon gender reassignment therapy . Jennine said: 'Some people accepted me . and some would not. I drifted from job to job, it was difficult to get a . job in the first place. 'I worked in call centres, but I finally got fed up when rumours started circulating that I was working as an escort. 'I had tough times and sometimes turned to drink to escape.' Over the years, Jennine has had relationships with both men and women, although she prefers women. She says she finds it difficult to meet people and is single at the moment, but is open to dating. She added: 'It’s hard enough to find someone these days when you are straight, so I find it particularly challenging.' Now Jennine has completed her transition from a man to a woman and gained the confidence to open her own business she is starting to feel accepted. She added: 'I am happier now than I have ever been. It has been a lot of hard work, but it has definitely been worth it. 'I have had a great response, and people appear to be a lot more accepting towards me. 'I don’t get many problems now, but there are always going to be people who will have a go, no matter how much you try to blend in. 'I try not to let it bother me, and as a whole I feel as though I get a positive response from the people I meet. Russell didn't have many friends during his time in the army and kept himself to himself but feels much happier in his new body . 'The only thing I wish is that I had taken the plunge earlier. Apart from anything else the earlier you start the better the result is. 'But really I am just happy that I have done it at all.' Jennine’s Darlington-based business Tyre-Seal provides a service which permanently fixes punctures. She said: 'I got the idea from working with vehicles during my time in the army. But also I suffered a lot of tyre damage when I was going through my transition and people kept vandalising my car, putting nails in my tyres. 'The sealant I use permanently seals punctures as you drive, it maintains tyre pressure and helps save fuel. 'It’s early days at the moment and I am hoping the business takes off, then life really will be good.'","Jennine Jackson, 47, was born Russell Jackson but always felt different .

Detective Anthony Williams told the Toronto Sun: 'The veterans should be respected. That’s a total disrespect for our sworn members and military members who have made the ultimate sacrifice.' City cleaners had to scrub the memorial to remove the graffiti on Monday morning. George Murphy, 72, whose father fought in the Battle of Monte Cassino and in Normandy during the Second World War, was left distraught by the sight of the vandalised memorial. He said: 'I think it’s terrible to see them destroy what these veterans have done for us. It’s like stepping on them. These people wanted to protect our lives.

As a consequence, the former MP for Luton South will not even receive a criminal record although the jury in the rare ‘trial of issue’ ruled that she had committed 21 counts of fraud. Last night, anti-sleaze campaigners reacted with astonishment to the news that Moran will not be jailed. It is also unclear whether any steps can be taken to reimburse the public purse. Moran is the fifth MP to face criminal proceedings for abusing parliamentary allowances. Between April 2004 and August 2008 she submitted fraudulent claims of around £60,000 – more than double that of any of the other four MPs who have been tried – of which she received more than £53,000. Moran did not have to appear at Southwark Crown Court nor enter a plea to the 15 charges of false accounting and six of using false information after a judge ruled her ‘severe depressive disorder’ meant she was unable to defend herself. The charges included submitting ‘bogus’ invoices for more than £22,000 for goods and services which did not exist. The jury found that the case against ‘broken woman’ Moran, who earned a £64,766 salary as an MP, was ‘proved’. Mr Justice Saunders said he cannot ‘punish her as such’ through a prison sentence or fine. Instead, he can give her a hospital order, supervision order or absolute discharge. He adjourned his decision but indicated a supervision order is most likely. Meanwhile, Moran is being treated by psychiatrists at home in Southampton. Last night former anti-sleaze MP Martin Bell said: ‘I am lost for words. What she did was an appalling abuse of public trust. I am amazed that so far only four MPs have ended up in jail. She should count herself very lucky that she is not the fifth.’ Ms Moran's appearance has changed dramatically since the 2010 election and she was found unfit to stand trial due to mental health issues . Matthew Sinclair, chief executive of the TaxPayers’ Alliance, added: ‘The verdict does not feel like justice done.’ The court heard how Moran, an MP from . 1997 until her resignation in 2010, ‘abused’ the system of claiming . parliamentary expenses, which was largely based on trust. Peter Wright QC, prosecuting, said MPs . were permitted to receive expenses for a designated second home, but . she had twice swapped the designation of her second home ‘in a process . known as flipping’. She had exploited the system to ‘kit out’ homes in London, Luton and Southampton. In 2006 she submitted a claim for . £4,756.40 for replacement kitchen units for her second home, which was . accompanied by an invoice from a firm called Elite Builders that was a . ‘complete forgery’. A year later, she submitted invoices for £14,805 and . £1,823 for work in the name of Mandere Construction, but the bills were . ‘utterly false’. In 2008, she ‘flipped’ her designated home to Southampton, which belonged to her then fiancé and now husband Michael Booker. She submitted false bills for £22,500 . of building work at this property, including dry rot repairs, which was . for work completed in the previous financial year, when she had already . exhausted her parliamentary allowance, and when her designated second . home was in Luton.","Jury rules former Luton South MP claimed for boilers which did not exist and 'flipped' home to claim almost annual limit in single bill .

Knockout: John Applewhite, 34, was punched in Long Island by a man in a random attack, breaking his jaw . A Long Island resident has been arrested for attacking a volunteer utility worker from Florida who had travelled to New York to help restore power after Hurricane Sandy left the region largely without power. Thomas Libretto, 34, was arrested outside of his Long Island home four days after allegedly beating up John Applewhite, also 34. Applewhite had travelled to East Hempstead, Long Island from his home in Lakeland, Florida with 24 other electrical workers, and had just finished a 16-hour shift when a man yelled at him from across a parking lot. Mr Applewhite said that the suspect got out of his black BMW, walked toward him, and punched him once in the face, breaking his jaw and fracturing several other bones in his face. The electrical worker said that he had just finished a gruelling shift helping out the Long Island Power Authority and was heading to dinner at the Texas Roadhouse when a man in a BMW across the parking lot began yelling at him. According to the Nassau County Police Department, the man parked his car and walked toward Mr Applewhite and fellow lineman John Barefoot. Scroll down for video . Return home: Applewhite was flown back to his home in Florida, where he will have his jaw wired shut and receive plastic surgery to repair his facial fractures . Thinking the man had a question about power restoration, Mr Applewhite headed in the direction of the man, while Mr Barefoot stayed by the service vehicle. ‘Just as I got within arm’s reach, he decked me,’ Mr Applewhite told WTSP. The single punch broke his jaw, his cheekbone, and other facial bones. He also suffered a black eye. When Mr Barefoot tried to intervene, the suspect allegedly bit him on the finger and then ran back to his BMW, driving away. Mr Applewhite was rushed to Nassau Medical Center, but he was eventually flown back to Tampa. The lineman said that his jaw has to be wired shut, and he faces reconstructive surgery to repair the broken bones in his face.

A photograph following the attack shows the lineman’s face badly swollen on the left side. Despite the brutality of the attack, Mr Applewhite said that he still holds a good impression of the town, according to ABC Action News. ‘It was one heck of a punch,’ he told the station. ‘If nothing else, I would like to shake the guy’s hand. He got a heck of a jab.’ Mr Applewhite’s sister, Mary Anne, told WTSP that she is saddened by the attack. ‘John is such a sweet person and he certainly didn’t deserve this,’ she said, noting the difficulty her brother will face during the upcoming holidays. But his father, Morris Applewhite, had a more practical solution. ‘If he has his jaw wired shut, we will just feed him through a straw, and he’ll enjoy it,’ he said. In the dark: More than 70,000 customers of Long Island Power Authority (LIPA) were without electricity Monday, two weeks after Superstorm Sandy struck .

"By . Graham Dunbar . PUBLISHED: . 06:23 EST, 13 November 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 09:11 EST, 13 November 2012 . Chelsea chairman Bruce Buck has launched an impassioned defence of the club's players in the aftermath of the race-row storm which has engulfed Stamford Bridge following allegations referee Mark Clattenburg racially abused John Obi Mikel. Buck says Chelsea agonised over the decision but, ultimately, were legally obliged to report Clattenburg in defence of Mikel and fellow midfielder Ramires, who made the initial allegation. The Blues chief has also backed club owner Roman Abramovich's decision to 'terminate' the tenure of former boss Andre Villas-Boas in a bid to halt the club's side down the Barclays Premier League and save their Champions League aspirations. Wise move: Chelsea fans should cheer Abramovich for his decision to sack Villas-Boas . Chelsea last week submitted a dossier . of evidence to the FA, including signed witness statements from players, . alleging Clattenburg used a term understood to have been interpreted as . racist during the 3-2 defeat by Manchester United. Clattenburg denies . the claims. Buck, however, . cannot understand why Chelsea have come under fire for reporting the . Durham official and believes the club have rightly taken the moral high ground. Buck, in a sensational interview with the Evening Standard said: 'The reaction has been very unfair,' he says. 'We weren't interested in any confrontation with the referee or . anybody else, had no thoughts of revenge on the referee. He made two . obvious mistakes (sending Fernando Torres off and allowing Javier . Hernandez's offside winner) which changed the tide. 'I felt we had the moral high ground, . so I didn’t really feel that bad about the defeat or have that feeling . in my stomach. I thought we'd be treated very kindly in the newspapers . next day. 'It was made after a great deal of anguish and after talking long and hard that evening about what should we do.' Buck believes the club were forced into a corner and once the two players involved came forward, they had no option but to make the report. And the American-trained lawyer stands by the claim that Clattenburg used the term 'monkey'. 'We were guided by obligations that are imposed by the Football Association and also as an employer. FA rule E14 basically says a participant shall immediately report to the association any incident or matter which may be considered to be a misconduct. 'Misconduct is a defined term under the FA regulations and includes such racial behaviour. We also had to consider the Equality Act 2010, which imposes an obligation on an employer to take certain actions if an employee is subject to discrimination by third parties. Suppose we had tried to sweep this under the rug and said to the various players, ""Look, it's not a big deal and the press are going to be all over us, maybe you want to reconsider"". If that had leaked out, we would've really been crucified.' Flashpoint: Mikel and Ramires made allegations about referee Clattenburg . Chelsea’s chief executive Ron Gourlay (right) has described the race rows that have blighted the club over the last 12 months as ‘bullet prints in our armour’ and charged the younger players at Stamford Bridge to repair Chelsea’s damaged image.The Champions League winners have struggled to win friends during public disputes fueled by racism allegations, while talismanic captain John Terry and big-spending owner Roman Abramovich have long been polarizing personalities in English football.‘There are things that have happened that damaged the image,’ Gourlay said, acknowledging that Chelsea has been under fire since Terry’s court case and, more recently, reporting referee Mark Clattenburg for alleged racist abuse. ‘There are bullet prints in our armor. We have learned from the mistakes we have made. Hopefully the football club is in a good position to push forward now.’He believes the widely admired talent of Juan Mata, Eden Hazard and Oscar is shifting people’s perception.‘That’s where we want to be,’ Gourlay added. ‘I think people like the way they are seeing Chelsea play football now, and that’s very important because it portrays itself as the image of the club.‘We are in a very, very strong place,’ the chief executive said on the sidelines of the Chelsea-backed International Football Arena conference in Zurich. Buck spoke with Chelsea chief . executive Ron Gourlay and headed into the team's dressing room after the . match with united at 6.15pm. And he says he was careful to rule out any . misunderstanding from the players involved - as neither uses English as . their first language. Buck was reassured both players spoke good . English. He said: 'I spoke to the players involved, either because they were allegedly the recipient of that abuse or had heard it, three separate times. 'I asked them if they could be mistaken. I asked them, if they might have heard Mikel instead of monkey. I thought I had covered that base.' The revolving-door policy operated by Blues' owner Roman Abramovich saw Andre Villas-Boas ditched two-thirds of the way through last season. The decision came just nine months after they had paid Porto £13million for his services. AVB failed to convince senior members . of the squad, like John Terry  and Frank Lampard that he was the man to . lead the club forward. But Buck denies that Terry runs the club, or that player power is too strong at Stamford Bridge. In . fact it was Abramovich's 'termination' of the Portuguese which led . Chelsea directly to their ultimate goal; Champions League glory. 'It didn’t take the players to tell . us we were not going in the right direction. I knew that, Mr Abramovich . knew that. 'When Andre left, we were in a very difficult situation about . to be bounced out of the Champions League, doing very poorly in the . Premier League. 'The proof is in the pudding: Andre . was terminated and we wound up winning two trophies. I want to hear you . congratulate Mr Abramovich and Chelsea for making that change.' Dogged . by controversy: Terry race row with Ferdinand came nine years after he . was cleared he was cleared of attacking a nightclub doorman (below) Read the full Evening Standard interview here . One thing Buck didn't deny was the . negative impact of the Terry race-row which has dogged the club over the . last 12 months - just the latest in the line of discretions from the . club's captain down the years. 'I can't argue with the fact that, . over the last 10 years, there have been a lot of public incidents in . which Terry and Chelsea were involved. But I don’t accept that we have . something in our hearts that says we’re going to chase the referees. 'It’s just not like that at all, . honest. Chelsea are not run by John Terry. I don’t know how I can prove . it to you but it’s not true. My club are run by Roman Abramovich.' Life . in west london changed dramatically the moment the Russian billionaire . arrived. In stark contrast to Ken Bates' loud . and brash style, Abramovich remains in the margins, allowing his staff to . speak on behalf of the club. Bright future: Chelsea's young players can help repair the club's damaged image . But Buck denies the claim this proves . Abramovich is aloof and hopes the club are moving down the right track . to preserve their position in Europe's elite. He said: 'It's not true that Mr Abramovich . does not care what people think about Chelsea. Rightly or wrongly, Mr . Abramovich changed English football forever. I feel very strongly that . he hasn't had enough credit for what he's done. Chelsea's heart is . definitely not black.

A drunken asylum seeker who killed a model in a head on crash as he drove the wrong way down a motorway was jailed for eight years today. Rebecca Caine, 20, was thrown from a friend's car and died instantly after Wilfred Museka ignored no entry signs and drove east along the west bound carriageway of the M62 near Rochdale in Greater Manchester. His Renault Megane ploughed into the Chevrolet Matiz car which was taking Miss Caine and three friends back to their homes in Leeds after a night out clubbing in central Manchester in September. Zimbabwean national Wilfred Museka (left), 31, who killed, university-educated aspiring model Rebecca Caine (right), 20 . Museka, 31, from Clayton, Manchester, had earlier been to a party where he had drunk cans of lager and rum and Red Bull.He was over twice the legal limit when he gave a blood sample over an hour after the accident. He pleaded guilty at Manchester Crown Court to causing death by dangerous driving, driving with no insurance or valid licence and driving with excess alcohol. Judge Adrian Smith told him: ' No sentence can possible reflect the loss of the life of Becky - a young, bright and hugely popular young woman who was about to finish her University education. 'She had a bright and happy future to look forward to and you have left a huge hole in the lives of her family. This was a flagrant disregard of the basic rules of motoring caused by your inability to exercise any judgement through the consumption of large amounts of alcohol.' The court heard that father of two Museka came to the UK in 2000 and claimed political asylum which he was granted until 2016 when his case will be reviewed. Members of Miss Caine's family wept as prosecutor Tina Landale told the court that Becky was not wearing a seat belt in the rear of the Chevrolet which was driven by friend Parvinder Singh.

She was sitting in the rear with another friend when the car was struck by Museka's Renault which was travelling at around 70mph in the wrong direction in the central lane. Museka had driven past no entry signs on the slip road at Littleborough near Rochdale and had ignored the warnings from a broken down motorist who shone his torch and waved his arms to attract his attention. He had travelled 1.5 miles at around 70mph when the front of his car hit the rear of Mr Singh's car as it tried to avoid a collision.

Nicola Gatto, defending, said Museka was 'consumed with regret and remorse' for the death and for the 'considerable pain' he knew he had caused his victim’s family. 'He is living in a never ending nightmare but he does not ask for sympathy or pity. He realises that nothing he can say can bring adequate solace to the family.'","Wilfred Museka ploughed into car going other way on M62 near Rochdale .

'It was a pretty big search and they had a lot of resources there, and I don’t think she’s in the water,' Anthony Harrison said on television. He told Nancy Grace that a few days . after the disappearance, Caleigh's sister Elizabeth claimed she saw a . mysterious man on the beach. 'She mentions a man. It’s a little . bit scattered because she is four years old, but she did after a while . mention a man on the beach that took her sister,' Mr Harrison said. 'It’s kind of hard to take a four-year-old’s word for it, but we’re looking into it.' Sought: Police conducted an extensive search of the beach, deploying half a dozen divers to comb the water .

Elizabeth calls the alleged abductor the 'mean man' and describes him as wearing black shorts, having facial hair and smoking a cigarette. Massachusetts State Police spokesman David Procopio said in May they are prepared to follow any lead thoroughly. 'As we previously stated, we found no evidence to support the abduction theory,' he said in a statement released to the press after the family appeared on the Nancy Grace show.

"By . Ray Massey, Transport Editor . PUBLISHED: . 07:48 EST, 13 November 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 21:43 EST, 13 November 2012 . Unnecessary signs which clutter up the roads are to be scrapped. They are an ugly, confusing and potentially dangerous blot on the landscape, Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin said yesterday. His promise to sweep them away was welcomed by the Campaign to Protect Rural England and motoring groups including the AA. The CPRE said the focus until now had been on the forest of road signs in urban areas, but the countryside was also being blighted. Motoring groups have welcomed plans to rid British roadsides of unnecessary signs . Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin will warn that some signs are actually making driving more dangerous. Here are several contradictory and confusing signs on a road in Surrey . Ridiculous examples spotted include signs declaring Sign Not In Use and Lane Closed To Ease Congestion. Mr McLoughlin, who was speaking at a conference in London organised by the CPRE, said: ‘Too many country roads carry a reminder of how insensitive planners can be to aesthetics. ‘Ugly and unnecessary signs clutter up the network. New signs seem to sprout like weeds, without any apparent consideration of what’s already there. Often what we’re left with is not just a blot on the landscape. It’s confusing and potentially dangerous too. ‘There are those ‘‘temporary’’  yellow signs saying New Road Layout Ahead that are left to rot for years. Near me in Derbyshire there’s an ugly big sign by a beautiful medieval church that just says: No Footpath. It’s on a small country lane. Of course there isn’t a path. We don’t need a huge sign to tell us that. So I’m determined to do more to sort this out.’ Ministers want an end to duplicate, unnecessary signs and those which give drivers conflicting or confusing information . Mr McLoughlin said a Government review last year had relaxed rules that used to insist on two signs by the road when one would do. Now it was working on revised traffic signs regulations. He insisted: ‘The combined effect of these changes will be to give authorities and designers much greater freedom to simplify and use fewer signs at country junctions. ‘And I want to make sure that they use it. So my message to highways engineers is: If in doubt, don’t do it. Save your money for something that really matters.’ The Campaign to Protect Rural England says there is no need for TWO signs pointing towards Stonehenge when the historic site is clearly visible from the A303 . Examples of confusing signs include this one, when the sign appears to contradict the road ahead . A CPRE spokesman said: ‘Signage clutter builds up over time without anyone taking responsibility for removing unnecessary signs. Not only does it disfigure the countryside, it also distracts drivers and entails long-term maintenance costs.’ AA spokesman Paul Watters said: ‘This is long overdue. There’s far too much clutter and it needs tackling.’ Mr McLoughlin also said the  Government was committed to pressing on with the controversial  £32billion HS2 high-speed rail plan from London to the Midlands and onwards to the North despite widespread opposition.

Lord Rogers has broken his silence over the death of his son and its effect on his wife Ruth. The architect said that although he can bear the loss, his celebrity chef wife is 'up and down' and often experiences a 'tsunami' of grief. The architect, whose wife is the celebrated chef and cookery writer Ruth Rogers, said 'somehow' he could bear the loss but had come to the conclusion that women coped less well with sorrow than men. Grief: Chef and cookery writer Ruth Rogers (left) is struggling to get over the death of her son Bo (right) 'I can bear it somehow — I have no idea how. Ruthie can't. It's a terrible thing' said Lord Rogers. 'I've come to the conclusion that women are different.' Bo Rogers died after suffering a seizure in a friend's bath last year. He had escaped from Vernazza in northern Italy when the town was hit by flooding and landslides. The 27-year-old was not epileptic, and it was thought that the shock and stress of the flood might have triggered his fit. Struggle: Bo Rogers' death came just two years after Ruth Rogers (right) lost her close friend and River Cafe co-proprietor Rose Gray (left) to cancer . Lord Rogers' designs include the Millennium Dome, the Lloyd's Building and Terminal Five at Heathrow Airport. The 79-year old was speaking at the launch of a campaign to repair the damage caused by the floods in Vernazza. He told the Sunday Times that his son - who spoke fluent Italian - loved the town. 'Bo was rather good at languages and spoke fluent Italian.' 'We adopted this place and it in turn adopted us, especially Bo. He just belonged. It was a family joke that one day he'd be mayor.' He hopes that the family will come to love the town again, but admitted it might prove a challenge for his wife. Lord Rogers, pictured with his wife, was speaking at the launch of a campaign to restore the Italian town of Vernazza, which was hit by flash floods the day before Bo died.

A group of police officers have recreated an old Victorian photograph to pay tribute to a constable who was murdered nearly 150 years ago. PC Ebenezer Tye, 24, was beaten to death with a cudgel as he tried to stop a burglar escaping in Halesworth, Suffolk, on November 25, 1862. His killer, John Ducker, confessed to the murder on the gallows and was the last person to be publicly hanged in Suffolk. PC Ebenezer Tye, 24, was beaten to death with a cudgel in 1862. His colleagues later posed at his gravesite . Five of PC Tye’s stern-faced colleagues in top hats were later photographed posed around his newly inscribed gravestone in Halesworth cemetery. The fading black-and-white picture has now been recreated by five Suffolk police officers currently serving in the Halesworth and Southwold area as a tribute to the dead PC. The five officers — Inspector Nick Aitken, Sgt John Shuttleworth, PC Andrew Phillips, PC Trudie Beckwith and PC Chris Sadler — all gathered around the grave in their modern uniforms. Inspector Nick Aitken, Sgt John Shuttleworth, PC Andrew Phillips, PC Trudie Beckwith and PC Chris Sadler posed at the graveside of PC Ebenezer Tye. PC Tye was murdered while on duty after being tasked with keeping an eye on local burglar Ducker, who was suspected of raiding local properties. The police officer had spotted Ducker carrying a suspicious-looking bundle in Chediston Street, Halesworth, and went to question him. There were shouts and a chase towards the reedbeds beside the River Blyth at the back of Chediston Street. Later that morning, after Tye failed to return to the police station, a search was made. His body was found in the river. He had been beaten with a cudgel. Ducker was subsequently caught, charged, tried for murder and sentenced to death. He confessed to the crime moments before he was hanged in Ipswich in 1863. More than 5,000 people attended the public hanging. In addition to the portrait tribute, a special exhibition to honour PC Tye on the 150th anniversary of his murder is to be held at Halesworth and District Museum with the help of Suffolk Police Museum . PC Chris Sadler, of Southwold & Halesworth Safer Neighbourhood Team, said: 'This case shows policing has always been a dangerous profession and that officers put their lives on the line even in comparatively rural areas to protect local communities and catch criminals. 'We also think that, while many things have changed, the basics of policing — fighting crime, keeping the roads safe and the problems of young men drinking a bit too much on a Friday night — will have been largely the same 150 years ago as it is today. 'My initial idea was just to recreate the photograph to pay some tribute to him but I spoke to Halesworth Museum about the idea and they offered to put on a display to commemorate the anniversary. 'Some exhibits are being transferred from our museum at police headquarters and, thanks to their support, a number of items about policing will now be on view from the end of the month.' A Suffolk Police spokeswoman said: 'In Ebenezer Tye’s day it was expected that officers would blow their whistles to get their colleagues' attention or shout the phrase ""Look up, Bill,"" which would tell the other officers that something was happening — it appears that Tye never got that chance. 'Today officers have radios to summon help and, in addition to batons, they carry Pava spray and wear stab vests to help protect in the event of attack.' The exhibition at Halesworth and District Museum will feature some of the material associated with the crime, including case papers, as well as other items including the uniform of officers at the time. The display will run from November 27 to December 15. The museum will be open from 10am to 12.30pm, from Tuesday to Saturday, and admission is free.","PC Ebenezer Tye was beaten to death as he tried to stop a burglar escaping .

Former Stringfellows lap dancer Nadine Quashie, 29, is fighting against a bid to get an employment tribunal ruling overturned . A former Stringfellows lap dancer performed for 'wages' so poor she often ended up with less money than she started after a night's work, it was heard today. Nadine Quashie's working terms while dancing at Stringfellows and Angels clubs in London were allegedly so miserly she 'often' ended up out of pocket or empty-handed at the end of the night. The 29-year-old won a landmark legal battle in April, becoming the first stripper to successfully claim employee status and sue for unfair dismissal. But now Stringfellows are seeking to have . that ruling overturned, arguing she could not have been an employee . because her working terms were such that she was 'often' actually paying . the club to let her to strip there, rather than vice-versa,  London's Appeal Court heard. A vital step on the way to mounting an unfair dismissal claim was the Employment Appeal Tribunal's (EAT) recognition that she was indeed an 'employee' of Stringfellows Restaurants Ltd, something which they had vehemently denied. Miss Quashie, of Greenford, west London, was to seek up to £63,000 in compensation when her case went back to the original tribunal. She worked at Stringfellows and Angels clubs in London during 2007 and 2008. Thomas Linden QC, for Stringfellows, said his clients had 'no wage/work bargain' with Miss Quashie, of Greenford, West London, because the terms under which she worked were such that she sometimes ended up out of pocket after working a full night. 'On the nights when she was dancing at the club, she danced for the customers and they paid her. Stringfellows had no obligation to provide her with work or to pay her anything,' the QC said. 'On the contrary she had to pay the club a fee of £65 to dance there, plus commission on her earnings from customers, plus fines for breaches of club rules, plus a tip out fee to the house mother, such that Miss Quashie often didn’t make any money or made a loss on a night’s work. Stringfellows are arguing they had no wage/work bargain with the lap dancer . 'There therefore was no wage/work bargain between the parties such as is required for employed status,' added the barrister. 'She was free to take as much or as little holiday as she chose. She was free to chose whether or not to work. She was also free to work for a competitor. There were not the mutual obligations and the Court of Appeal ought to interfere.' John Hendy QC, for Miss Quashie, told the judges: 'She worked for Stringfellows as a dancer. There was a contract between them. 'Stringfellows’ business is the provision of adult entertainment to its customers, in the form of female dancers such as Miss Quashie who dance clothed, semi-clothed and nude both on stage and in private booths. 'The dancers receive payment for doing so. The dancers also sit and talk to customers for payment. Stringfellows’ business depends upon the work of women dancers like Miss Quashie on every occasion on which their premises are open for business. 'The work of dancers like Miss Quashie generates a substantial part of Stringfellows’ revenue ...(they) are an integral part of Stringfellows’ business, without which it could not function.' Addressing the claim that little or no wages meant no employment contract, he concluded: 'These days it is not uncommon for people to agree to work for no pay, to gain work experience for example. 'She could agree to dance to Stringfellows’ tune, if that allowed her to dance at the club to enhance her reputation, to keep her hand in, or for networking.' Lord Justice Ward, hearing the appeal with Lord Justice Elias and Lord Justice PItchford, found some of what he heard today puzzling. Telling the court about his understanding of the day to day life of a Stringfellows Angel, he said: 'I am gradually getting filled in on the duties of laptop dancers. The punters pay for their happy vouchers and they are stuck in the girl’s garter, and then she goes off to the cashier and says here’s my vouchers, give me my money.' Miss Quashie, 29,had claimed she was wrongly fired by the Covent Garden nightclub in December 2008 over allegations of drug dealing. The Appeal Court hearing continues.","Nadine Quashie, 29, won landmark legal battle in April where she successfully claimed employee status .

The fashion publicist who confessed to the brutal butchering of his girlfriend on New York’s Lower East Side was today sentenced to 25 years to life in prison, the heaviest sentence available for the crime. The 33-year-old Raul Barrera had confessed to first beating then stabbing his beautiful girlfriend of three years, Sarah Coit, in her Clinton Street apartment after she had told him she was done with their relationship. He left her disemboweled and nearly headless, with a steak knife still embedded in her skull, as frantic neighbors tried to find where her screams were coming from. Slain: Raul Barrera left Lacoste sales manager Sarah Coit, pictured, bleeding in her bedroom after a 'skirmish' got 'out of control' Confession: Raul Barrera (centre) admitted to stabbing his girlfriend after they began to 'tussle' following an argument . Prosecutor Matthew Bogdanos said Barrera was looking for a ‘show worthy of popcorn’ according to the New York Post. When beating was no longer enough, he . began stabbing the young woman with a total of five knives, Mr Bogdanos . said. ‘Two were butcher knives,’ he said, ‘the kind you use on the . toughest joins in the toughest animals.’ He noted that the beautiful blonde was only 23. Ms Coit was still alive when Barrera . finished. Her intestines were spilling out of her body, there was a . steak knife jetting out of her skull, and here head was nearly severed. ‘I don’t know. I lost it,’ Barrera is heard mumbling to a police officer and a prosecutor just five hours after the brutal slaying of the young Lacoste sales manager. Barrera said the pair had begun arguing before the ‘tussle’ began and ‘things got out of control’. He said: ‘Then we started arguing a little bit. Got into a tussle and there was this silver cart thing next to the edge of the kitchen counter and we must have knocked it down and we must have knocked it down and all the cutlery, the knives were in the…they just all fell to the ground and then we fell to the ground. ‘And I was on top of her. Then my hand just got a cut and it was bleeding a lot profusely and I just…things got out of control.’ After stabbing Miss Coit repeatedly, he then admitted to dragging her, as she lay dying, from her living room into her bedroom before flinging his coat on her, according to the New York Post. Rather than calling the emergency services, he phoned his parents, sister and his son to ‘apologise,’ changed out of his blood-soaked clothes and left the New York apartment to hail a cab. Brutal: Miss Coit was nearly decapitated and the blade of one of the knives used by Barrera was still in her skull when police found her . All the while his girlfriend lay bleeding out in her bedroom. When asked by the prosecutor whether he thought to call 911, Barrera simply answered: ‘No.’ At no point in the interview did Barrera ask what condition Coit was in, but he did note that her condition was ‘really bad’ at the point of leaving the flat. He was then asked why he did not call an ambulance. ‘I was just afraid, panicked, scared. I just, I didn’t know what to expect.’ Earlier in the trial, Miss Coit’s father, Lynde Coit, laid bare  his grief at the loss of his daughter as he testified in court. In an emotional testimony, the millionaire lawyer from Greenwich, Connecticut said: ‘When I identified Sarah's body in the basement of the morgue, her injuries, the look on her face, the terror, will haunt me for the rest of my life and haunt the rest of her family.' Haunted: Miss Coit's (left) father, Lynde (right), identified the mutilated body of his once-beautiful daughter in the morgue and said the terror in her face will 'haunt me for the rest of my life' Mr Coit described how he had travelled to New York, expecting to share a meal with his daughter at her favourite pizza restaurant, according to The New York Post. Miss Coit was living in a tenement apartment in the lower Manhattan neighbourhood and the proximity of the houses to each other left neighbours thinking her blood-curdling screams were coming from the building next door. As such, Barrera was lacerating the young woman for 35 minutes before police finally knocked on the right apartment, eventually finding her breathing her last breathes in a puddle of blood, with bent and broken knives littering the floor.","Raul Barrera's taped confession of killing Sarah Coit, 23, details 'skirmish' that 'got out of control'

Dr Scott Broadwell found himself in this position on Friday evening after the romantic plans he had organized to celebrate his wife Paula's 40th birthday were abruptly shattered by the revelation that she had been having a relationship with decorated general David Petraeus. The couple were enjoying a two-day break at the Middleton Inn in Little Washington, Virginia when news of the scandal broke, leading to Petraeus stepping down as CIA director.

Romantic getaway: Paula Broadwell was celebrating her 40th birthday with her doctor husband at the Middleton Inn in Little Washington, Virginia when the news of her affair with CIA director David Petraeus broke . Happier times: Paula and Scott Broadwell live in Charlotte, North Carolina and have two young sons . Sources told the Washingtonian.com that the couple had enjoyed 'strenuous' bike rides, champagne and cozy dinners since arriving at the luxury inn on Thursday evening. The Broadwells took the Ascot Room at the Manor House which is available for $295 - $475 a night. It boasts a working fireplace, four-poster bed and private marble bath. According to sources, Dr Broadwell, a radiologist, had arranged for Champagne and a bouquet of roses for his wife's milestone birthday. There is plenty to do in the idyllic .

The couple reportedly joined other guests at the Inn for breakfast - but by the time they returned from a romantic dinner on Friday evening, they were described to the magazine as 'not being in very good moods'. They left abruptly on Saturday morning and were allegedly on their way to D.C. A party had also been planned for Mrs Broadwell's birthday on Saturday night - but it was cancelled. The Middleton Inn could not confirm to MailOnline today whether Dr and Mrs Broadwell had stayed at the premises out of respect for guests' privacy. Romance: The couple had been staying in a room with four-poster bed and roaring fire - but left abruptly on Saturday morning . Chemistry: David Petraeus stepped down as head of the CIA on Friday after it was revealed that he had an affair with his biographer Paula Broadwell . The Broadwells have two young sons and live in suburban Charlotte, North Carolina. The family's upmarket home has been empty since the weekend with two silver cars parked in the brick garage. Paula Broadwell moved to Charlotte, more than three years . ago with her doctor husband and their two young sons. On their driveway, power-washed writing reads in a flourishing font: ‘Dad loves Mom.’ Neighbor Ed Williams told the Charlotte Observer that . he emailed Paula Broadwell on Friday following the news, asking if there was . anything he could do to help. He told the paper that Broadwell . responded, saying that her family was alright, and to look after their . house. Earlier in the week, Williams, a retired editor, saw Broadwell with her two children when she was voting in last week's U.S. presidential election. He told Reuters that Broadwell appeared chatty and cheerful. Neighbors were working on putting together a belated party to celebrate the release of her book. Indiscretions aside, the 40-year-old has a . series of accomplishments under her belt. A graduate of West Point . Academy, she went on to travel to Afghanistan and conduct research at . Harvard. Broadwell was in the Army Reserve after . being recalled three times to active duty since 9/11 to . work on counter-terrorism issues. Petraeus's relationship with Paula Broadwell, his biographer who is a fellow Westpoint military graduate, was revealed on Friday after an FBI investigation which suspected corruption between the pair. Luxury: The Broadwells stayed at the lavish B&B at the weekend, where rooms cost up to $500 a night . Breathtaking: The married couple were enjoying the weekend of bike rides and hiking for Mrs Broadwell's 40th birthday . But Broadwell's father, Paul Kranz, . said that he is standing by his daughter '100 per cent' - and expects . more details into the affair will emerge, suggesting it was part of some . cover up. 'This is about . something else entirely, and the truth will come out,' Kranz said . outside his home in Bismarck, North Dakota on Sunday. Supporters . of Petraeus were quick to cement the timescale of his affair - saying . that it began last November and ran its course by July this year. Colonel . Steve Boylan, a friend and former spokesman, said today that the . relationship with Broadwell began in November 2011 - two months after . Petraeus became CIA director. It suggests that the illicit . relationship began only after Petraeus had left the military - and so . exempting him from prosecution as adultery is considered a crime in the . armed forces. The affair came to light after the . FBI investigated a series of threatening emails sent to 37-year-old Jill . Kelley, who works for the State Department in May. The . warnings, that told Mrs Kelley to 'stay away' from Petraeus, left her . feeling threatened and she contacted the FBI. However the trail led to . sexually explicit emails from an account created under a fake name by . Petraeus. She had met . Petraeus in 2006 when she was a student at Harvard's John F. Kennedy . School of Government, and the two casually exchanged emails for two . years. In 2008, Broadwell . bonded with Petraeus while interviewing the four-star general during . runs on the Potomac River as she pursued her Ph D in public policy. Memento: A message that was pressure-washed into the driveway remains at Paula Broadwell's home in Charlotte, North Carolina on Saturday afternoon . No one home: The home of Paula and Scott Broadwell in Charlotte has been vacant since the scandal broke . Broadwell, . who spent three years doing researching for her biography entitled All . In: The Education of General David Petraeus, had extensive access to the . head of military operations while he served in Afghanistan. Petraeus quit his post as CIA director while offering an apology when the scandalous revelation came to light. He issued a statement acknowledging the affair after President Obama accepted his resignation, which was announced by the CIA soon after. Dr Broadwell is not the only spouse for whom the affair would have come as a bombshell - the disgraced CIA director has been married to his wife Holly for 38 years. She is so angry at his affair that . 'furious would be an understatement', a former spokesman for Petraeus . said. Col Steven Boylan said Holly Petraeus is 'not exactly pleased . right now'. The look that says it all: Paula Broadwell (second left) fixes her gaze on General Petraeus while his wife Holly (third left) walks ahead .

The heartbreak comes just one month after the couple appeared the picture of unity at the wedding of their daughter, Anne, in an elegant ceremony in Berryville, Virginia - around 40 miles from Little Washington. Members of Dr Broadwell's family revealed that they only learned of the alleged affair as they watched reports of Petraeus's dramatic resignation last week.

A quarter of pensioners paying for residential care will end up losing their home and almost all their savings, a report warned yesterday. As many as 40,000 people who fund their own fees will see their assets so depleted they will have to fall back on the mercy of their local council. Many of them will face the trauma of being moved to a lower-quality home. Care firms may even pressure children to find cash so their parents can stay in the home they feel familiar in. Some self-funders will be forced to take lesser quality accommodation as a result of the pressures . The vulnerable may also be told to move into a smaller room or share. The findings, by the Local Government Information Unit, lay bare the scandal of elderly people who have saved all their lives losing almost everything at the very end, and leaving them little to pass on to their children. Experts warn that the ageing population, coupled with council cuts, mean the number of people losing everything will increase – unless the Coalition caps the amount individuals need to contribute to their own care. Ros Altmann, of over-50s group Saga, said: 'It is outrageous that we are in a position, in our advanced economy, where we can't say to someone that – no matter how much you have paid, no matter how much you have saved – we can guarantee you will be able to stay in the same place to get the care you need.' A year in a home costs an average of £27,000. Self-funders typically spend four years in residential care, with 12 per cent staying there for eight years. The elderly must fund the full cost if they have more than £23,250 in assets – including the value of their home. A council will step in to help pay only when assets fall to the £23,250 level. At £14,000, it will fund the full costs. Ministers say that although they agree in principle with the idea of a cap, proposed last year by economist Andrew Dilnot, there isn't enough money in Treasury coffers to fund the £1.7billion annual cost. Jonathan Carr-West, of the LGIU, said: 'It is not a good situation to be in when you run out of cash, you have nothing to leave to your family, and you end up in a situation where the council – and not you – are making decisions on your care. 'You could find you've depleted your assets and suddenly you are living somewhere else. If you run out of money you will not necessarily be able to stay in your home.' Chris Horlick, of insurance firm Partnership, which worked on the report with the LGIU, said the huge costs are alarming for lifelong savers. 'They've lost everything – everything they've worked for,' he said. 'Ultimately they lose their dignity, they lose any choice over where they can live. This is a devastating position for anyone to be in.' The report – Independent Ageing: Council Support for Care Self-funders – warns of the threat to town halls of the increasing number of people falling back on the state for care when their resources are depleted. Outrageous: Many self-funders have no one else to turn to and risk becoming fully dependent on the state . It is estimated that some 171,000 of the 419,000 residents of care homes are self-funders. A survey of more than 100 councils, carried out by the LGIU think tank, and a series of detailed interviews with some of them, found that around 25 per cent of those who fund their own care end up relying on the state. This would equate to almost 43,000. It warned councils they will have to find around £500million to fund those who fall back on the state. 'The cost of self-funders running out of money is considerable,' it said. 'These costs are real and immediate. 'Individuals are often unaware that if they run out of funds, and fall back on state provision, they may have to move to cheaper care facilities.' Mr Horlick said he knew of a woman in Kent who was paying £1,000 a week for residential care. But her local authority will pay only £470 a week. 'The company wouldn't need too many such cases for the care home to become marginal in terms of profitability,' he said. 'The lady doesn't have any family – if she runs out, that's it.'","As many as 40,000 who self-fund their care must fall back on local councils .

But it seems this annual office blowout can be as daunting as it is fun for Britons, with over half confessing they avoid the festivities completely for fear of committing a faux pas in front of their colleagues. Small talk trepidation and dance floor dread means many of us will shun the champagne for the sofa in a bid to avoid festive fun altogether, with women more likely to stay away than men. DON'T hit the bar with a vengeance: No one wants to be the casualty everyone is talking about (and sniggering at) the next day . A new survey has revealed that more than one in five (22 per cent) of office workers admitted to their very own Bridget Jones moment after misreading the dress code during the party season. Drinking too much is the biggest fear among a fifth surveyed, with alcohol-fuelled embarrassment a particular panic for those in the North West (27 per cent) and London (28 per cent). A not-so-subtle one in ten admit to having called in sick following the work Christmas party with Londoners being the most likely to pull a 'sicky' (22 per cent) compared to just 5 per cent of those angels in the South West. Making inappropriate remarks makes nearly one in five nervous (17 per cent), while mishaps under the mistletoe puts the fear into one in seven (14 per cent), and one in ten admit to worrying about setting tongues wagging with dubious dance moves.

The loveable sheepdog breed used to advertise Dulux and the corgis famously favoured by the Queen are at risk of extinction. Only 316 old English sheepdog puppies have been registered with the Kennel Club this year, while less than 450 offspring of the historic Pembroke Welsh corgi breed have been confirmed. The Kennel Club has placed them on its list of endangered breeds, along with 30 others including the wheaten terrier and Welsh terrier. Sharon Tolliday, an old English sheepdog breeder from Suffolk, told The Sunday Times a 'misapprehension' that the breed is 'high maintenance' and the public's preference for smaller dogs has led to its decline. She added: 'When Dulux adverts originally came out we were inundated. They were very popular but their popularity had dwindled.' The shaggy-haired breed was first used by the paint company in Australia in the Sixties before being introduced to advertising campaigns in the UK. The first dog to hold the role was Shepton Dash, who starred in the ads for eight years. Pembroke Welsh corgis have been a Royal Family favourite for more than 70 years, with the Queen owning 16 of the famous herding dog.

He was known to millions during World War II as one the BBC voices who announced the twists and turns of the conflict in reassuringly unflappable tones. But it now appears the Nazis also took a chilling interest in senior newsreader Frank Phillips - his details were discovered on a hand-written index card in propaganda chief Dr Joseph Goebbels’s files soon after the capture of Berlin. Found by BBC war correspondent Richard Dimbleby, the card contains Mr Phillips’s name in capital letters, followed by the annotation ‘Erstklasse Verleser‘, first class newsreader. A marked man: Frank Phillips would have been well known to the Germans because he was the first BBC presenter to announce his name before reading the news . Mr Phillips’s son, Jonathan, 58, said the existence of card probably meant his father - who features in BBC 1’s Antiques Roadshow on Sunday evening - was ’a marked man’ had Adolph Hitler successfully invaded Britain. Mr Phillips’s fluent baritone would have been well known to the Germans - as well as to the 16 million Britons who regularly listened to the Home Service - because he became the first BBC presenter to announce his name before reading the news, ending a long-standing practice of anonymity. The change was introduced in July 1940 amid fears that Nazi fifth-columnists could somehow infiltrate the Corporation and put out false news broadcasts to undermine morale, a deception made far harder by genuine newsreaders identifying themselves. Concerns that the Corporation could be infiltrated by spies persisted right up to the final stages of the war, and secrecy was especially tight on D-Day. On the morning of the allied landings in France, Mr Phillips collected a highly secret script, hand-written rather than typed, from a safe in Bush House which he was instructed to read during a special bulletin which began with his then boss John Snagge announcing the invasion. In the bulletin, on June 6 1944, Mr Snagge declared: ‘Allied naval forces, supported by strong air forces, began landing Allied armies this morning on the northern coat of France.’ Mr Phillips‘s script started: ‘From the BBC in Great Britain, we are now sending an alert for the countries on the coast of Western Europe occupied by the enemy. John Snagge, pictured second from left with other BBC presenters, was Mr Phillips's boss and then the BBC's presentation director . ‘The people of France are being told of communique No1, which you have just heard, and warned to stand by for an important broadcast from supreme headquarters allied expeditionary force. It continued: ‘The important message to the peoples of the Western Seaboard of occupied Europe which will follow … will be heard by their compatriots throughout the world. ‘It will be carried by all services of the British Broadcasting station in Europe and in the United States by the short wave stations of the Voice of America.’ Mr Snagge, then the BBC’s presentation director who later became famous for his commentaries on the University Boat Race, found the original scripts when clearing out offices in 1959. He sent them Mr Phillips, explaining in an accompanying letter that the scripts, which had presumably been hand written by an official in the Government’s Ministry of Information, could not have been dictated or typed by a secretary because they were so secret. Mr Phillips, who worked at the BBC between 1935 and 1963, had the documents framed, including a copy of the script of the historic announcement made by Mr Snagge which had been autographed by Britain’s wartime Prime Minister Winston Churchill and American military leader Dwight Eisenhower. Chilling: The Nazis seemed to have taken an interest in Frank Phillips as his details were discovered on a card in Dr Joseph Goebbel's files . Mr Phillips’s son Jonathan, who will be seen with the scripts on the Antiques Roadshow on Sunday night, said his father belonged to the era when newsreaders wore dinner jackets to read news bulletins on the radio, presumably to encourage as much formality as possible. He said: ‘He became a big name. I can remember walking around London with him and no one recognised him until he spoke, and then people said “I know that voice”.’ His father, a former professional singer who died in 1980, made several other historic broadcasts, including the announcement of the dropping of the atom bomb on Hiroshima in Japan in 1945 and the assassination of US President J F Kennedy in 1963. Jonathan said he had come across about 60 touching letters written to his father after the war by people in occupied Europe who had said that the sound of Mr Phillips’s voice had boosted their spirits in difficult times. One was from a former concentration camp prisoner and another was from a Dutchman who said the broadcasts had been so important to him that he had named his son after the newsreader. During the Antiques Roadshow, the expert Jon Baddeley cites the letter from Holland, adding: ‘Obviously during the war, the radio was such an important part of society, both here in the UK and presumably across Europe.’ Mr Badderley valued the documents at about £2,000, but Mr Phillips said he would never part with them.","Frank Phillips was the first presenter to announce his name on the news .

Marked for death: Brett Hartman claims he had nothing to do with the brutal 1997 murder of Winda Snipes in Akron, Ohio . A condemned killer who claimed he was wrongfully accused of stabbing a woman 138 times, slitting her throat and cutting off her hands was put to death today. Death row inmate Brett Hartman has acknowledged he had sex with victim Winda Snipes early on the morning of September 9, 1997 at her Akron apartment, but did not kill her. Today, he calmly accepted his death. 'I'm good, let's roll,' he said in his final words. He then smiled in the direction of his sister and repeatedly gave her, a friend and his attorney a 'thumbs up' with his left hand. 'This is not going to defeat me,' Hartman then said to warden Donald Morgan, who didn't respond. The effect of the single dose of pentobarbital did not seem as immediate as in other executions at the state prison in Lucasville, in southern Ohio. Four minutes after Hartman first appeared to be reacting to it as his abdomen began to rise and fall, his abdomen rose and fell again, he coughed and his head shifted rhythmically for a few moments. His sister, Diane Morretti, dabbed at her eyes during the process. The warden declared Hartman's time of death as 10:34am. Both Hartman's attorney, David Stebbins, and prisons system spokeswoman JoEllen Smith said the gap between Hartman's movements was not out of the ordinary. Hartman claimed he did not kill Snipes, but found mutilated body and panicked, trying to clean up the mess before calling 911. It was a claim rejected by numerous courts over the years. The U.S. Supreme Court denied a last-minute appeal by Hartman yesterday. Hartman's last meal, which in Ohio is called a special meal, consisted of steak with sauteed mushrooms, fried shrimp, Macaroni & Cheese, a baked potato with butter and sour cream, Rainforest Crunch cereal, cans of Pepsi and Dr Pepper, and a bowl of Honey-Comb cereal, a prison spokesman told MailOnline. Hartman is the 49th inmate put to death since Ohio resumed executions in 1999. Hartman came within about a week of execution in 2009 before federal courts allowed him to pursue an innocence claim. When that claim failed, Hartman had a new date set last year, but that was postponed because of a federal lawsuit over Ohio's execution policy. Murdered: Ms Snipes had been stabbed 138 times. Her throat had been cut and her hands were cut off in the gruesome murder in her home . The Ohio Parole Board has unanimously denied Hartman's requests for clemency three times, citing the brutality of the Snipes' slaying and the 'overwhelming evidence' of Hartman's guilt. Hartman's attorneys have long said that crucial evidence from the crime scene and Snipes' body has never been tested, raising questions about Hartman's innocence. The evidence included fingerprints allegedly found on a clock and a mop handle. Hartman also argues the evidence could implicate an alternate suspect. Second, the attorneys argue that if Hartman's innocence claim is not accepted, he should still be spared because of the effects of a 'remarkably chaotic and nomadic early childhood,' including being abandoned by his mother and left with an aunt on an isolated Indian reservation. Third, lawyers say Hartman's behavior in prison has been exemplary and shows he is a changed man. They cite his devotion to religious studies, his development as an artist and community service projects in prison. The state opposed these arguments, citing the strength of the evidence and the fact that courts have repeatedly upheld Hartman's conviction and death sentence. The state also said Hartman refuses to take responsibility and show remorse.","Bret Hartman will be executed today in the murder of Winda Snipes .

Unsuccessful: Charles Edwards tried to fight against the state's decision over his sexual encounter with an 18-year-old student but the court rejected his appeal . A former teacher who appealed his conviction for having consensual sex with an 18-year-old student has lost. The Kansas Court of Appeals upheld a state law designed to prevent sexual relations between teachers and students. Charles Edwards, who had been the choir teacher at Wichita Northwest High School, argued he should be held to the same standards as professors at university campuses who are allowed to have sex with their students. The court disagreed, stating in its . report: 'While it is true that both situations involve learning . environments, the circumstances are hardly comparable.' It continued: 'High school attendance . is mandatory... while attendance at college is voluntary. Most of the . children attending K-12 schools are minors.' Edwards said the law infringed on his right to have consensual sex with a consenting adult in his home. He was charged with having sex with the student in March 2010 and then placed on probation after being found guilty. State law says having sexual contact with a student at your school is a low-level felony for a teacher or person in position of authority. The ruling acknowledged Edwards' defence but disagreed with it. High school: Charles argued he should be treated in the manner of university professors who are allowed to have sex with their students . 'Teachers are in a unique position to groom or coerce students into exploitative or abusive conduct,' it read. 'The state must provide a safe school environment for students, which includes preventing the sexual exploitation of students. 'A sexually charged learning environment would confuse, disturb, and distract students, thus undermining the quality of education in Kansas.' The ruling continued: 'Students very well may not have the necessary level of maturity to remove themselves from a sexually charged situation.'","Charles Edwards had consensual sex with a student but it broke state law .

This week is Living Wage Week and comes just weeks after Labour leader Ed Miliband set out his party's agenda for ensuring employers pay a wage that meets the cost of living.

Bad example: Buckingham Palace has said it is now reviewing its policies on wages following criticism from campaigners over a part-time role advertised below the recommended living wage . The role is paid just 47p above the national minimum wage - a salary equivalent to £13,000 per year. It has been reported that no accommodation is provided with the job which includes vacuuming, mopping, dusting and general household maintenance. The role requires a 30 hour week between the hours of 8am and 1pm daily. Graham Morris MP, a Labour campaigner for the Living Wage said this advert is setting a bad example. 'This looks really bad.' he told the Daily Mirror. 'Since the Queen receives considerable support from the public purse she should pay a living wage, not just barely a minimum wage. 'She's setting a bad example to other employers. Windsor is one of the 12 most affluent boroughs in the country, so you would anticipate the cost of living would be much higher. 'I would hate to see a return to the Victorian days where a privileged elite preside over the unwashed masses and just pay the bare minimum.' The advert for a cleaner at Windsor Castle was offering just £6.67 per hour . A spokesperson for PSC Union told Mail Online: 'It's shocking that in this day and age these sorts of jobs are still not taken seriously and still receive this kind of wage. 'This particular example really points up the stark and glaring inequality in the whole system. 'You have people on very low wages cleaning the houses of one of the richest families in the country, and these house bring millions of people to Britain every year. 'It's a situation that really needs to be dealt with and it should be obvious in this day and age.' A spokesman for Buckingham Palace refused to comment on the charge that the Queen is setting a bad example to other employers. 'We are reviewing a our policies in regard to the living wage,' the spokesman said. The spokesman also denied the claim that this particular job came with no accommodation. He added:'All cleaning jobs come as an employment package which includes housing being provided.'","Queen attacked for 'setting a bad example' to other employers .

She had to have 17 stitches to her face after Monsheimer pushed a . tumbler into her face when she bumped into her on the dance floor. Unemployed Monsheimer, 25, of Kirk Hallam in Derbyshire, pleaded guilty to wounding the woman in the Market Inn in Ilkeston, on February 25. At Nottingham Crown Court, Judge Philip Head told her: ‘There is too much pub violence and the courts take it very seriously. ‘You put a mark on somebody’s face and after surgery it is likely she’ll be marked by what you did for the rest of her life.’ James Hett, prosecuting, said the victim was a pub customer and began to use the pole on the dance floor when she accidentally bumped into Monsheimer. He added that a male customer saw the incident. He said: ‘After the first accidental collision, he was fearful of the defendant’s subsequent response should the incident recur. ‘When the pair collided again, Monsheimer pushed her in the chest, then threw the contents of her glass into the woman’s face. ‘The two tried to hit each other, apparently without success. ‘The incident culminated with the . defendant deliberately thrusting the glass she was holding towards the . complainant. It came into contact with her face and the tumbler broke.’ The victim was treated at the Queen’s Medical Centre where she received stitches, but follow-up treatment will be needed. Monsheimer's victim, whose face was slashed with a glass, accidentally bumped into her on the dance floor of The Market Inn in Ilkeston (pictured) Mr Hett said: ‘She was traumatised and felt she had been mutilated. ‘She has been reluctant to leave her home address ever since and found it difficult to go to activities in public. ‘She feels depressed and no longer feels safe to go into Ilkeston and has difficulty sleeping.’ David Outterside, mitigating, said: ‘This was inexcusable behaviour. ‘She wishes to say sorry to her victim for what she has done and the best expression of that is her guilty plea.’ The judge at Nottingham Crown Court (pictured) said there was 'too much pub violence and the courts take it very seriously' He said she had a ‘happy home’ and provided stability for her child.

Sexual objects: Aaron Thomas accused of being the East Coast Rapist has revealed having seen women as objects to him while facing trial for 17 sexual assaults over a decade . The man suspected behind more than a dozen rape cases along the East Coast says he doesn't know why he couldn't but admits his victims were only objects to him. Aaron Thomas, 41, has revealed that his victims, at least 17 confirmed and a dozen more feared, were objects picked off the street and that he doesn't think he is crazy, but that something is wrong with him. 'It’s awful. It’s scary. ... I don’t know why I couldn’t just stop,' Thomas told the Washington Post in a series of jailhouse interviews. ‘It’s something not right because people are getting hurt.’ After the attacks spanning nearly two decades leaving residents fearful of going about their everyday lives, Thomas is expected to plead guilty on Tuesday to the abduction of three women trick-or-treating in 2009 on Halloween night. He is also expected to plead guilty in rapes both in Prince William County and Loudoun County in 2001. In the aftermath of the Halloween attack, hearing his two victims speak at a preliminary hearing, was what Thomas said made him realize the despicable nature of his crimes. Series of attacks: Thomas was arrested in early 2011 after a multi-state effort to catch the man reported being responsible for rapes in Maryland, Virginia, Connecticut and Rhode Island . Caught: A U.S. Marshal said a tip directed them to Thomas prompting them to track him for several days before taking a cigarette butt he discarded and claiming his DNA was linked to the cases . ‘It was terrible,’ Thomas told the Post of that hearing where the court saw him rest his head on the table as his victims recounted the attack in stomach-twisting detail. ‘I was melting in my seat. I was disgusted.’ Thomas was arrested in Connecticut in March 2011 after a multi-state law effort to catch a man believed responsible for rapes and other attacks on 17 women since 1997 in Maryland, Virginia, Connecticut and Rhode Island. A prosecutor told the court that when Thomas was arrested he asked police: 'Why haven't you picked me up sooner?' Police have since feared there could be many more rape victims, based on the FBI profile of a serial sexual offender. Detective John Kelly of Fairfax County Police, Virginia, said: 'It could be as much as a dozen more.' He said serial criminals typically have twice as many victims as have been reported. Thomas was placed on suicide watch after it was revealed he had tried to hang himself in his cell just 24 hours after his arrest. DNA from a cigarette butt taken from Thomas has been linked to DNA at the scene of the attacks. Thomas, who lives in New Haven, has been charged with first-degree sexual assault and risk of injury to a minor and is being held on $1million bond. Authorities in Prince George's County, Maryland, are charging him with being a fugitive as well as rape and abduction counts and use of a firearm while committing a felony. Plea expected: Seen in a courtroom sketch during his arraignment in March of 2011, on Tuesday Thomas is expected to plead guilty to a number of rapes . U.S. Marshal Joe Faughnan said a tip from the County directed them to Thomas. They tracked him for several days, before taking a cigarette butt he had discarded and claiming his DNA was linked to the cases. Mark Magaw, acting police chief, Prince George's County said: 'It was a week when the predator became the prey.' The hunt for the East Coast rapist which began in 1997 had become desperate. He eluded authorities for years despite committing a string of high-risk outdoor attacks. The predator wore a mask or hooded sweatshirt to conceal his face in some assaults, investigators say. He typically approached women outdoors on foot and threatened them with a knife or a handgun. His last known attack was the one on Halloween night in Woodbridge, Virginia. Attacks: The predator wore a mask or hooded sweatshirt to conceal his face in some assaults, investigators said, typically approaching women outdoors on foot and threatened them with a knife or a handgun . During a hunt by police, 700 suspects were interviewed and cleared of involvement.

Victims responded to news of the arrest with tears of relief, revealed Detective Kelly. He added: 'They are just extremely happy to have accountability.' Thomas was not entirely unknown to law enforcement: He had been arrested in September in Woodbridge, Connecticut, on a larceny charge and was released on $1,000 bond, according to public records. He had lived previously at addresses in Maryland and Virginia, records also show. Attacks happened in Prince Georges County, Maryland in 1997, 1998 and 2001, in Fairfax County, Virginia in 1998, 2000 and 2001, in Leesburg, Virginia in 2001, in Cranston, Rhode Island in 2006, in New Haven in 2007 and in Prince William County, Virginia in 2009.","Aaron Thomas, 41, is expected to plead guilty to a series of rape charges on Tuesday .

Workers are cutting out the traditional brew after work, a practice that is falling flat with bar owners. One result of the 2008-2009 recession that reduced manufacturing jobs in places such as Milwaukee has been slower traffic at some bars, and sluggish beer sales nationwide over the past four years, according to industry analysts. More concern about healthy living, stiffer drunk-driving laws and measures that ban smoking in places such as taverns have hit beer sales during the last couple throughout the country. Falling flat: One result of the recession that reduced manufacturing jobs in places such as Milwaukee has been slower traffic at some bars, and sluggish beer sales nationwide . According to Washington-based trade group The Beer Institute, beer drinkers last year in the United States drank 203.4 million barrels, about five percent less than in 2008. 'Contrary to the myth that people go out and drown their sorrows, the truth is that beer drinkers are pretty responsible people and when they have to cut back, they're cutting back on their pleasures,' said Chris Thorne, vice president of communications at the Beer Institute told Reuters. 'There has been a definite shift from the on-premise to the off-premise consumption,' said Pete Madland, executive director of the Tavern League of Wisconsin. 'The smoker, for instance, is going to the liquor store, buying a 12-pack of beer and going home.' Over the past few decades, it has become much less acceptable in the business community to have a drink during lunch or tip a few after work with colleagues. 'Society looks at that person that has a glass of beer with his burger like he has a drinking problem,' Madland said. Drowning sorrows: Workers aren't the only ones feeling the strain - many bars have felt the downturn too . A glimmer of hope for the industry is the high-end craft beer segment, which has seen sales increase by 14 percent during the first half of 2012 compared with the same period last year, according to the Beer Institute. These regional and local brews are more expensive and tend to be more recession-proof than mass-consumption brands like Miller Lite and Bud Light. 'Those occupations that weathered the storm of the Great Recession and then a very weak recovery ... they were always able to afford a high-end beer,' Thorne said. 'We would still like to see that American pilsner part of the brewing market get back its share.' Despite the cultural and economic pressures, beer remains synonymous with Milwaukee, where brewers such as Fred Miller, Joseph Schlitz, Val Blatz and Frederick Pabst built their empires more than a century ago. Cutting back: Those who wish to drink are often just buying their own beer at a liquor store then going home to drink it, cutting out bars . Even after heavy manufacturing of farm equipment, marine diesels and cranes became the dominant force in Milwaukee's economy, MillerCoors remains an institution, brewing about 10 million barrels of beer each year on the city's west side. The love affair the city has for beer remains strong, evident in its Major League baseball team - the Milwaukee Brewers - paying homage to the city's beer makers while playing in Miller Park, sponsored by MillerCoors. While beer consumption nationwide may be down, in Wisconsin it has increased a bit. In the first eight months of 2012, about two percent more beer was sold than the same period of 2011, the state revenue department said. Milwaukee also remains a blue-collar town with a fair number of neighborhood taverns such as Zad's Roadhouse still serving a shot and a beer to the working class from early morning until late into the night, according to Milwaukee historian John Gurda. 'The scene is far from gone. I'm talking about saloons and bars being the communal living rooms of Milwaukee, and in many neighborhoods, that's still very much the case,' Gurda said.","U.S. drinker consumed five percent less last year than before the recession .

A man was tasered by police after he picked up his garden hose and attempted to stop a fire spreading that was threatening to engulf his home. Dan Jensen, 42, awoke from a nap last Thursday when he hear his wife, Angela, also 42, scream that the house next door at 3420 Beechwood Terrace N in Tampa Bay was ablaze. When the father of two went outside, the fire had already engulfed his neighbors’ home and a fence in between the two houses and the flames were starting to lick the corners of the Jensens' home. Dan Jensen was tasered by Pinellas Park police after he used a water hose to spray his home to prevent it from catching fire . The incident happened after a grease fire got out of hand in the Tampa Bay area . Jensen first emptied a fire extinguisher on to the blaze, before grabbing his garden hose. Police officers arrived on the scene before firefighters and told Jensen to back off. He did, but quickly grew frustrated waiting for the fire department and so decided to pick up the hose again. As he did, and without warning, Jensen felt electricity run through his body and he collapsed to the ground. 'It was wrong,' he told The Tampa Bay Times. 'There's no way around it. … I was fighting a fire. I wasn't fighting police. I thought they were here to help me. Instead, they hurt me.' Pinellas Park Police say they had to tase Jensen because he was putting not only himself, but also officers in danger because he refused to back down. They claim it only took six minutes for fire fighters to respond and that they could have charged Jensen with obstruction, but decided against it. An attorney working for Jensen has described the police’s actions as ‘excessive force.’ When Jensen went outside, the fire had already engulfed his neighbors' home and a fence in between the two houses .

David Petraeus was shocked to hear his mistress had been sending harassing emails to a female friend and asked her to stop before the situation blew up into a sex scandal that cost him his job. Petraeus told friends he was stunned when he found out that his biographer Paula Broadwell - with whom he was carrying on a lurid sexual affair - was suspected of sending anonymous, threatening emails to a friend who she saw as a rival for the ex-CIA boss' affections. A source close to Petraeus said Monday that FBI investigators informed him that Broadwell sent anonymous emails to Jill Kelley, a family friend of the general from his time at Central Command in Tampa, Florida, warning her to stay away from him. Request: Gen Petraeus, pictured with his biographer and mistress Paula Broadwell, asked her to stop when he found out she was sending threatening emails to family friend Jill Kelley . When Kelley told Petraeus that Broadwell was behind the emails, the four-star general told his biographer to knock it off, The Washington Post reported. The associate spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss confidential conversations with Petraeus. The CIA director resigned on Friday after confessing to and apologizing for the affair. Broadwell reportedly sent the emails from dummy accounts she had set up to Mrs Kelley, FoxNews.com reported. Spooked by the bullying in her inbox, Mrs Kelley notified the FBI. Victim: Jill Kelley, a family friend of Gen Petraeus, went to the FBI after she received the threatening emails . Mistress: Paula Broadwell's close contact with Gen Petraeus raised red flags among his advisers . A government official told the New York Post that the emails contained such language as: 'I know what you did,' 'back off' and 'stay away from my guy.' The official added: '[Broadwell] clearly thought something was going on' and felt she was in a 'lovers triangle.' What followed was an intense FBI probe in which Broadwell and Petraeus - both married with two children - admitted to investigators that they had engaged in on-the-side sexual trysts. A senior federal law enforcement official told NBC News that the probe concluded on November 2, just four days before the presidential election. The network reported that Director of National Intelligence James Clapper wasn't notified of the investigation until Election Day. Indiscreet: Aides have said Paula Broadwell posted Facebook postings about her adventures in Afghanistan that crossed the line into potentially leaking sensitive operational details . Insensitive: Paula Broadwell traveled frequently to interview Petraeus during his time in Afghanistan but sources said her immodest attire made her stick out like a sore thumb in the conservative culture . The emails were not the first time Broadwell had raised red flags while behind a computer. Advisers to Petraeus had become suspicious Broadwell due to her playful Facebook status updates they claim disclosed sensitive details about military operations in Afghanistan. She became a cause of concern back in 2009 when those in Petraeus' inner circle saw her lighthearted postings on Facebook. Former Petraeus aides told the Washington Post that Broadwell's behavior at the time seemed odd and her closeness to the . notoriously straight-laced family man was not without controversy. Skeptical: Those close to Petraeus were shocked the military chief placed so much confidence in Paula Broadwell since they say she lacked the credibility and credentials of a biographer . Security no-no: Petraeus passed on an unofficial photograph to Broadwell of him meeting with actress Angelina Jolie at the CIA, breaking with agency protocol .

A widow who gave birth to her husband's twins through IVF after he died is embarking on a legal battle to ensure her children are treated as their father's heirs. Paula Mattison is taking her fight to the Michigan Supreme Court after her now 11-year-old twins were denied survivor benefits because they were not yet alive at the time of their father Jeffrey Mattison's death. The Social Security Administration in Michigan, U.S., has refused to grant Mallory and Michael Mattison the monthly benefits, citing the fact that they did not technically 'survive' their father. 'The law has not caught up with the science': The Michigan Supreme Court will decide whether the twins should be treated as their father's heirs even though they were conceived and born after his death . When Mr Mattison first fell ill, he decided to have some sperm frozen so that the chemotherapy treatment he was about to undergo would not prevent him and his wife from having children. When he died in 2001, his wife used the preserved sperm to conceive through IVF, and Michael and Mallory were born around 10 months after her husband's death. She believes her son and daughter are entitled to receive survivor benefits - worth a few hundred dollars per month based on Mr Mattison's earnings - but the Social Security Administration has refused to pay out. The Michigan Supreme Court will hear the case - the first of its kind in the state, and one of only a handful across the U.S. - on Thursday. Joan Coulter, a family law attorney in St Louis, Missouri, said: 'A lot of these situations are so new that the law has not caught up with the science. Michigan Supreme Court in Lansing will hear the case - the first of its kind in the state . 'We're making new law here, and it's a pretty exciting time if you're a lawyer,' she told the Detroit Free Press. 'Why shouldn't these kids get the money?' asked Mrs Mattison's attorney Victor Bland, who pointed out that the twins' 14-year-old sister Jenna - who was also conceived through IVF, but before her father's death - is receiving the benefits. Some U.S. states allow for inheritance to be awarded to children conceived posthumously, but Michigan is not one of them. State law says that for children to inherit they must 'survive the decedent'. 'Thus, the individual is required to be alive at the time of the decedent's death,' attorneys for the Social Security Administration state in court papers. Before he died, Jeffrey Mattison left a power of attorney authorizing his wife to take 'any and all action necessary pertaining to any sperm or embryos I may have stored, including their implantation or termination'.Mr Bland argues conception shouldn't be defined solely by the moment when sperm meets egg, but is instead 'a process'.In the case of the Mattisons, that process spanned many months and Jeffrey Mattison was alive for much of it, even injecting his wife with hormones to assist the process the night before he died, the lawyer has said. But the Social Security Administration insists 'there is no basis for this interpretation of ""conception"" in the state...statutes'.","Paula Mattison, of Michigan, U.S., conceived twins through IVF using the frozen sperm of her late husband .

Nine new species of colourful, tree-climbing tarantulas have been discovered in Brazil, including four from a mysterious, ancient genus once thought to have been extinct. The finds highlight how little is still known about the fauna of the Brazilian Atlantic Rainforest, a habitat which is under serious threat from human encroachment. 'Instead of the seven species formerly known in the region, we now have sixteen', said Dr Rogério Bertani, a tarantula specialist at the Instituto Butantan in Sao Paulo, who carried out the study. Pretty in pink: This shows the newly found Typhochlaena amma, from the Brazilian Atlantic rainforest mountain range in the state of Espirito Santo, Brazil . The so-called arboreal tarantulas are known from a few tropical places in Asia, Africa, South and Central America and the Caribbean. They generally have a lighter build, thinner bodies and longer legs than other kinds of tarantulas, which makes them better suited for their habitat. Increased surface area at the ends of their legs makes them better equipped to clamber across different surfaces, while their light build makes them more agile. Their core area is the Amazon, from where most of the species are known and normally very common, living in the jungle or even in domestic surroundings. 'Resurrected genus': A Typhochlaena costae specimen from from Brazilian cerrado in the state of Tocantins. Spiders of this genus are the smallest arboreal tarantulas in the world . Highlander: A specimen of the newly discovered Iridopelma katiae, which was found living inside bromeliads at the top of table mountains where trees are rare . Dr Bertani's findings have been . published in the open-access journal Zookeys, where he has described how . four of the new discoveries belong to the Typhochlaena genus that had . once thought to be extinct. Whether it's a shark or a tiny spider, there are many things out there that scare us. But we may not be in as much danger as we think as our fears can make objects seem much closer than they actually are. For fear can skew our perception of approaching objects, causing us to underestimate the distance of a threatening one, according to researchers from Emory University in Atlanta, Georgia, and the University of London. The findings, published in Current Biology, show that emotion and perception are subtly intertwined in the mind. 'In a resurrected genus with a mysterious single species known from 1841, we have now five species,' he said. 'These . are the smallest arboreal tarantulas in the world, and their analysis . suggests the genus to be very old, so they can be considered relicts of a . formerly more widely distributed taxon'. Other discoveries include new species, . Pachistopelma bromelicola, which lives inside bromeliads, a type of . flowering plant which often contains water in overlapping leaf bases. 'Only a single species had been known to live exclusively inside these plants, and now we have another that specialized in bromeliads as well,' Dr Bertani said. A further species, Iridopelma katiae, was found living inside the same kinds of plants at the top of table mountains where trees are rare. 'This species also inhabits bromeliads, one of the few places for an arboreal tarantula to live that offer water and a retreat against the intense sunlight' he said. The discovery of all these new species outside the Amazon was unexpected and illustrates how little we know of the fauna surrounding us, even from hot spots of threatened biodiversity like the Brazilian Atlantic Rainforest and the Cerrado (a kind of savannah vegetation). These species are highly endemic and the regions where they live are suffering high pressure from human activities, according to the research. Worse still, all these new species are colourful, which could attract the interest for capturing them for the pet trade, constituting another threat.","All discovered in the Brazilian Atlantic rainforest or nearby grasslands .

He was banned from the internet but a judge overturned the decision (file picture) A perverted snooper who used a secret camera to video a 14-year old girl in the shower and was banned from using the internet will now be allowed to go online after a judge ruled the ban 'unreasonable'. Phillip Michael Jackson, 55, was arrested after the suspicious youngster spotted a flashing light in a shampoo bottle and found a mobile phone behind a hole. The police investigation found hundreds of sex images, featuring animals and children as young as four, stored on his computer. Jackson, of Dartford in Kent, was sentenced to a community order with three years supervision at Woolwich Crown Court in June this year. He was also hit with a sexual offences prevention order (SOPO), banning him from owning a computer, using a camera in public, coming into contact with children at work and allowing the police to raid his home at any time. But after he complained that he was being cut off from the world, appeal court judges ruled it is 'unreasonable nowadays to ban anyone from accessing the internet in their home'. Mr Justice Collins and Judge Nicholas Cooke QC, sitting at London’s Criminal Appeal Court, overturned the strict SOPO, replacing it with an order that he simply make his internet history available for viewing by the police. His lawyers argued that the order imposed by the Crown Court judge - which he said should last until the day Jackson died - was unnecessary and disproportionate. Police found hundreds of images on Jackson's computer, some featuring animals and children as young as four (file picture) Mr Justice Collins told the court: 'The judge imposing the SOPO said, ""I anticipate that you will die subject to this order - that is my wish anyway."" They were not appropriate remarks to have made.' Also criticising the 'lurid language' used by the judge, he concluded that the SOPO imposed on Jackson was 'entirely excessive'. 'Nowadays it is entirely unreasonable to ban anybody from accessing the internet in their home,' the appeal judge concluded.

John Whittingdale said Lord Justice Leveson would send ¿a very dangerous message¿ if his inquiry into press standards calls for statutory regulation . State regulation of newspapers would set ‘an extraordinarily dangerous precedent’ that would send a message ‘around the world’ that Press freedom wasn’t worth fighting for, a senior MP warned last night. John Whittingdale, chairman of the influential Commons Culture, Media and Sport Committee, said Lord Justice Leveson would send ‘a very dangerous message’ if his inquiry into press standards calls for statutory regulation. In one of the most hard-hitting warnings regarding the Leveson Inquiry to date, Mr Whittingdale said a demand for new laws could encourage autocrats to erode hard-won freedoms around the world. He told a Society of Editors conference in Belfast that newspapers’ efforts to draw up a more robust self-regulatory system, under the stewardship of Press Complaints Commission chairman Lord Hunt, should be given a chance to work. That would see papers sign binding contracts to adhere to a much tougher regime to settle complaints, with large fines for those who break the rules. Crucially, it would avoid passing laws to underpin a new regulator that would ultimately give politicians a way of meddling with Press freedom. The Conservative MP warned that the introduction of state regulation in the UK could start a domino effect in other nations. ‘I think there is a real danger of that,’ he said. ‘It would set an extraordinarily dangerous precedent. It sends a very dangerous message elsewhere. ‘There is no question that this country is seen as a real beacon of freedom, something that we should be immensely proud of. ‘For the UK to set a precedent in establishing a government body with some involvement and influence over the Press I feel would give a green light to all those other countries which would say, . “Well if the UK can do it, the place where parliamentary democracy was formed, the place where the Magna Carta was written, then clearly it is OK and we can do the same”.’ He added: ‘This is being watched around the world and may well be followed if we go down that road.’ Barrister David Price, QC, an expert in media law, told the conference that David Cameron’s appointment of Lord Justice Leveson to head the inquiry into press standards was a mistake. He said he was surprised the judge was given the job since he is a criminal lawyer, rather than an expert in libel, defamation and privacy law. Media law expert David Price, QC, questioned Lord Justice Leveson's appointment as he is a criminal lawyer, rather than an expert in libel, defamation and privacy law . ‘He is a criminal lawyer – all his instincts will be to regulate, to look back at something that has gone wrong,’ he said. Lord Black, executive director of the Telegraph Group who has drawn up the alternative to statutory regulation, told the conference Lord Justice Leveson should give editors six months to prove the beefed-up watchdog would ‘be the scourge of bad journalism’. Jonathan Grun, editor of the Press Association and the new president of the Society of Editors, said even the ‘dab’ of statute that campaigners are demanding would affect freedom of expression. ‘That dab would be only the start – in time the screws would be turned,’ he said. ‘That would eventually remove a precious freedom that we should cherish. The liberty of the Press is the birthright of a Briton. Not the birthright of newspaper owners, or editors, or journalists – it is the birthright of every citizen. If that is extinguished it may be that some small sections of society will celebrate but over time the vast majority of the public will be the losers.’ Lord Justice Leveson is expected to report back later this month or early in December.","Laws governing the press are a threat to democracy, says John Whittingdale .

Other members of the Commons Culture, Media and Sport Committee warned it would be ‘bonkers’ to impose statutory regulation on the Press while leaving the internet and Twitter users unrestrained. Tory MP Angie Bray said: ‘If there is no way of bringing Twitter and the like into line it makes it absolutely ridiculous to start talking about statutory regulation of the newspaper industry.’"

A senior Mirror group executive was paying £125-a-time for mobile numbers and voicemail pin codes two years before it was known that the News of the World was relentlessly hacking phones, it emerged today. Scotland Yard is said to have invoices from private investigators who provided the service, and yesterday the male former Mirror employee accused of employing them refused to comment on the allegations. The paperwork, seen by the Independent, allegedly shows that the Mirror was regularly using loopholes in the law before 2000 to allow them to hack phones. Plunge: Shares in Trinity Mirror fell by more than 10 per cent after claims of phone-hacking were lodged against its newspapers and today damning invoices allegedly show an executive paid for phone numbers and voicemail pins . It came as investors in Trinity Mirror called for an investigation as shares in the publisher fell more than 10 per cent after Sven-Goran Eriksson was among four people to lodge claims of alleged phone-hacking against its newspapers. The High Court legal action is the first in the hacking scandal to be launched against newspapers outside Rupert Murdoch’s News International. The regimes of three Trinity Mirror editors are implicated in the . claims, including Piers Morgan who edited the Daily Mirror between 1995 . and 2004. One major shareholder told the Financial Times: 'We need as much information as possible on this. Any inquiry would be a good thing as that would clear up any concerns about further scandals.' Another added: 'A year ago we had discussions with Trinity and they claimed they had done an internal investigation. We were never convinced they were asking the right questions. There was a lack of clarity and satisfaction.' Former England football manager Mr Eriksson has filed a complaint alleging hacking at the Daily Mirror at a time when Piers Morgan was editor. Claim: Former England football manager Sven-Goran Eriksson (left) has filed a complaint alleging hacking at the Daily Mirror at a time when Piers Morgan (right) was editor . Mr Morgan, now a CNN talk-show host in the United States, has repeatedly denied any involvement in the practice and rejected claims during a high-profile appearance at the Leveson Inquiry last December. The three other claimants are Coronation Street actress Shobna Gulati, Abbie Gibson, a former nanny for the Beckham family, and Garry Flitcroft, the former captain of Blackburn Rovers football team, and they involve the Sunday Mirror and The People. The claims, lodged at the High Court, allege ‘breach of confidence and misuse of private information’ relating to the ‘interception and/or misuse of mobile phone voicemail messages and/or the interception of telephone accounts.’ No further details have been filed. Media lawyer Mark Lewis, solicitor for the four, said that unlike cases involving the now defunct News of the World - in which a list of alleged victims was found in a notebook - there was no paper trail this time. He told Sky News: ‘There might not be . a documentary smoking gun, but we will show there is a smoking bullet, . the consequence of the actions.’ Legal action: Former footballer Garry Flitcroft (left) and Coronation Street actress Shobna Gulati (right) have also made a claim against Trinity Mirror . Trinity Mirror said in a statement made through the London stock exchange: ‘We note the allegations made against us by Mark Lewis in today’s papers. ‘We have not yet received any claims nor have we been provided with any substantiation for those claims. ‘As we have previously stated, all our journalists work within the criminal law and the Press Complaints Commission code of conduct.’ News International has settled dozens of phone-hacking claims, paying out tens of millions of pounds to compensate victims. The Mirror claims come weeks before Lord Justice Leveson - who has been conducting a long-running inquiry into the press - is due to unveil his expected proposals for future regulation.

'Jilted': Karen Orchard arrives at Truro Crown Court accused of trying to kill her former partner and her best friend by allegedly running them down in her car after they started an affair . A jilted mother tried to mow down and kill her former partner and her best friend after they began an affair, a court heard today. Karen Orchard, 40, drove her people carrier three times at Geoffrey Richards and Rosanna Vanhorn after she spotted them walking hand in hand in the village of Lizard, west Cornwall, it was alleged. Truro Crown Court was told that minutes afterwards she sent a text message in which she wrote: 'I have just tried to kill them.' She also condemned Ms Vanhorn, who had been her best friend, in the same text, which was recovered by police from her phone. Orchard, a mother of two, wrote: 'You were right as usual about sweet, little, innocent Rosanna, f****** b***h.' She claimed that she was the ‘latest of at least three women’ whose men Rosanna had ‘muscled on in’. Orchard denies charges of attempted murder against both Mr Richards, 41, and 35-year-old Ms Vanhorn as well as alternative charges of attempting to cause GBH with intent and two further counts of dangerous driving on January 21 this year. Prosecutor Llewellyn Sellick told the jury: 'The defendant learned that her ex partner Geoffrey Richards, known as Gof, had started a relationship with a friend of hers, Rosanna Vanhorn, and she decided that she would kill them by running them over in her car.' The jury heard Orchard and plumber Mr Richards split up last Christmas but he had not told Orchard about his new relationship with Ms Vanhorn. Mr Sellick said on the night in question Orchard saw the couple hand in hand in the village and drove her car at them, forcing them to jump out of the way. He said she had her hand on the horn continuously as she drove at the couple. Mr Sellick said: 'They jumped out of the way, had they not jumped they would have been run over.' Mr Richards said the first incident - in his evidence - was more ‘to scare’ them. But 20 minutes later they returned to Ms Vanhorn’s Peugeot car and found that it had been rammed forwards by Orchard’s vehicle and yellowy orange paint and excrement had been poured over it. The police had been called by a local pub landlord and Mr Richards went to see if Orchard was back at her home because Ms Vanhorn was worried about a possible threat to her children and horses. Mr Sellick said that Orchard then drove at them again, mounting a pavement and striking a concrete bollard that got caught under the front of her car. The prosecutor said: 'The bollards saved them. Without them they would have been run over.' The frightened couple ran off as Orchard reversed off the bollard and she then drove at them for a third time. 'Victims': Geoffrey Richards and Rosanna Vanhorn (pictured leaving court) had to 'jump out of the way' to avoid being run over, the jury was told . Ms Vanhorn was on top of a gate about to leap away when Orchard’s car hit the gate which landed on top of Ms Vanhorn. Ms Vanhorn told the court: 'I was on the floor when the car went through and the gate ended up on top of me. 'Then the car reversed, I tried to get up, but I couldn’t get to my feet, then Geoff grabbed me away from the car as it was reversing, I didn’t see what happened after that.' The pair hid behind some nearby garages as . Orchard again reversed her car and drove towards the smashed gate, the court heard. Mr . Sellick said: 'It is the deliberate driving at these two people which . we say is attempted murder. We say she intended to kill them.' The text message also revealed that Orchard had been battling cancer for 12 weeks on ‘ top of all the other sh**’. She accused Ms Vanhorn of ‘cosying up to Gof knowing full well we had still been sleeping together’. 'I have just tried to kill them': Orchard drove her people carrier three times at Mr Richards and Ms Vanhorn after she spotted them together in the village of Lizard (file picture), west Cornwall, her trial heard . She added in the text: 'I have just tried to kill them. If you hear the rossers (police) they are for me.' She also wrote that there was nothing left of her life and she felt like jumping to her death ‘but for my girls’. She branded the pair ‘evil’ adding that they will be ‘glad I am gone’. After . the series of incidents, Mr Richards rang Orchard and she screamed and . shouted at him in that call saying ‘this was the final nail in the . coffin’ and Ms Vanhorn was ‘a bitch’. He said: 'She said she has done this before to other people. This is the third time she has done it.' When police arrived, Orchard was at . home crying and had drunk a little wine to calm herself down and her . clothes had orange paint on them. In . a prepared statement to police, she said: 'I totally deny that I . purposely drove at Gof or Rosanna or tried to harm them. I drove to see . them. 'I was peeping my horn . to get their attention but before I got to them, they ran off. At no . stage did I run them over. I wanted to talk to them.' Truro Crown Court (above) heard Orchard and plumber Mr Richards split up last Christmas but he had not told Orchard about his new relationship with Ms Vanhorn . Mr Sellick told the jury she drove at speed deliberately at the pedestrians and ‘that is clearly dangerous’. Mr Richards gave evidence and said in the first attempt Orchard drove at them with her headlights on and horn blaring at speed. He . told the court: 'She drove at us and swerved away. I guess she was . upset. She swerved away at the last minute about three metres from us. We jumped out of the way. 'I don’t think at the time she was driving at us,' he admitted, adding: 'It was more of a scare. It was a bit frightening.' Prosecutor Llewellyn Sellick . He said they met ten years ago when she worked in the local pub and last slept together a month before the alleged incident - and allegedly a month after he and Ms Vanhorn had become ‘friends’. Mr Richards said after the first incident he did not want to press charges because ‘I did not want to get her into trouble’. Defence barrister Michael Melville-Shreeve accused Mr Richards of exaggerating the whole incident. He said: 'All she did was honk her horn at you.' He said Ms Vanhorn only suffered two minor grazes to her elbows and said it was ‘absolute nonsense’ that she had been trapped under the gate. Mr Melville-Shreeve suggested: 'We were spotted by Karen Orchard and she honked her horn with some vigour. Rosanna and you were hand in hand together.' He said the couple ‘nipped off like caught-out teenagers’ when they were spotted by Orchard, who lives in Lizard Village, who only wanted to speak to them. Orchard, who walks with the aid of a stick because of an ankle injury, denies all six charges against her. The trial continues.

The 29-year-old woman was discovered dead from 15 stab wounds to her back in the couple's condo on Forest Hill Road which appeared as if it was ransacked in the course of a burglary. Couple: Jonathan Crupi was detained for allegedly killing his wife, Simeonette Mapes-Crupi, who was found stabbed to death in their Staten Island condo on July 5 .

The murder occurred in a quiet, tree-lined street in New Springville, across from a golf course where neighbours say crime is scarce. Police told the Staten Island Advance that there did not appear to be any signs of forced entry at the home, which had been ransacked. Neighbours reported that they didn’t see or hear anything suspicious until her husband made the horrific discovery. The couple's dogs were found locked in a room, and neighbors did not . hear them barking. One onlooker, who declined to be identified, told the New York Daily News: 'He’s like, ""She’s dead!

"By . Sean Poulter . UPDATED: . 18:39 EST, 1 January 2012 . Families could see the cost of food, children’s clothes and other essentials rise by £800 a year under European Commission proposals for a radical shake-up in VAT. The warning has been triggered by a Commission white paper on the future of VAT and efforts to harmonise the sales tax across Europe. The Coalition government raised the VAT rate to 20 per cent in January. However there is an exemption for food, children’s clothes, tap water, passenger travel, books, newspapers and some other products. Families could see the cost of food, children's clothes and other essentials rise by £800 a year under European Commission proposals for a radical shake-up in VAT . The UK also has a lower rate of 5 per cent on domestic energy bills in a bid to help struggling families. The . Commission, which is supported by the UK’s respected Institute for . Fiscal Studies(IFS), argues that exemptions should be abandoned in order . to create a common VAT regime, cut business costs and improve the . functioning of the European single market. Such . a move, which could raise £24billion a year for British government . coffers, would be a hammer blow to the country’s poorest families and . pensioners. However, Brussels and the IFS argue that most – but not all - of the money could be given back through measures including a cut in the standard rate of VAT, lower income tax and increases in benefits. Richard Asquith, the head of VAT at the international business services company, TMF Group, sounded the alarm over the Commission plans. He pointed to proposals buried in the Commission white paper - ‘Towards a simpler, more robust and efficient VAT system tailored to the single market’. Significantly, the paper argues for a . shift towards a simplified VAT regime with exemptions reduced to a . minimum in a bid to reduce bureaucracy and boost economic growth. The UK also has a lower rate of 5 per cent on domestic energy bills in a bid to help struggling families . It . states: ‘The fragmentation of the common EU VAT system into 27 national . VAT systems is the main obstacle to efficient intra-EU trade and thus . prevents citizens from reaping the benefits of a genuine single market. ‘To simply stay in the comfort zone of ‘business as usual’ will not be enough. ‘Responding to these challenges demands a more ambitious reform of the current VAT system.’ Mr Asquith . said: ‘The EC is also looking to eliminate many reduced VAT rate . exemptions in an attempt to impose a harmonised fiscal regime across all . 27 member states, and help countries consolidate their financial . position in the face of the current Euro crisis. ‘For . the UK, this means its cherished zero VAT rating of food and other . goods, such as books and newspapers, could be lost.  ‘Instead, it would . be forced to raise the VAT rates on household food spend to the standard . VAT rate to 20per cent.’ The . latest Office of National Statistics’ Family Spending report shows that . the average household weekly expenditure on food and non-alcoholic . drink averages £53.20 a week. If VAT was added to this figure at 20per cent, this would cost households £553 per year. Raising VAT on energy from 5per cent to 20per cent could be another £180, while abolishing other exemptions on tap water, train and bus tickets, books and newspapers could be at least another £100. In theory, Britain has the right to set its own VAT rates. However, it will come under increasing pressure from the other 26 member states and organisations like the IFS to abolish the current exemptions. While the UK does not charge VAT on food, the sales tax is applied at 20per cent in Belgium, 19.6per cent in France, 19per cent in Germany, and 13per cent in Spain. Mr Asquith said: ‘Currently, the UK is the only country in the EU that does not levy the full VAT charge on all foodstuffs. ‘The rationale behind this exemption is that the less well off, who spend a larger proportion of their incomes on food, would be disproportionably hit.’ The Commission argues that if VAT was applied at the full rate to more products, it would be possible to reduce the standard level. Raising VAT on energy from 5per cent to 20per cent could be another £180, while abolishing other exemptions on tap water, train and bus tickets, books and newspapers could be at least another £100 . The white paper concludes: ‘Introducing a broader tax base, as well as implementing the principle of taxation at the standard rate, would generate more revenue at less cost, or alternatively allow the standard rate to be reduced in a revenue-neutral way.’ There is no figure on what the new UK rate might be. It might be possible to apply VAT at 15per cent, rather than the current 20per cent. However, even under this scenario, the cost of essentials, such as food, heat, and clothes for children would rise sharply. The IFS was involved in the background research used to draw up the Commission proposals and it argues against the UK’s VAT exemptions. It believes poorer families can be protected against extending the sales tax to food, children’s clothes and other produced by changing the tax and benefits regime. Senior research economist at the IFS, David Phillips, said: ‘Exemptions, in particular, are anathema to the whole principle of VAT. ‘As part of our study for the EU Commission we examined the welfare consequences of abolishing zero and reduced rates of VAT. ‘We found that because of less distortion to household’s spending decisions, removing all zero and reduced rates and using the revenue to reduce the main rate would lead to welfare gains amongst the winners that exceed the welfare losses of the losers to the tune of £1.1 billion in the UK. ‘Whilst such a reform would, on its own, be regressive, changes to direct taxes, tax credits, and benefits could be used to address this concern, redistributing the gains from winning households to the poorer losing households.’ These could include an increase of £1,000 in income tax allowances, so taking 1.5million people out of paying the tax; a 2p cut in the basic rate of tax, and 1.5p cut in the higher rate of tax. There would also be a 3.4per cent increase in other tax allowances, tax thresholds, tax credits and benefits. The IFS said: ‘Spending the proceeds in this way offsets the regressive impact of broadening the VAT base.’",EC says VAT exemptions on things like food and children's clothes should be abandoned .

Police have revealed that the drifter accused of raping an elderly woman in broad daylight in New York's Central Park was also linked to a 2002 murder in his home state of West Virginia, although investigators have never had enough evidence to charge him. David Albert Mitchell, 42, has had run-ins with the law for virtually all of his adult life, and was twice charged with crimes in which the alleged victim was an elderly woman, according to court records and a prosecutor. Scroll down for video . Alleged rapist: David Albert Mitchell, pictured, has been arrested in connection with the brutal rape of a 73-year-old birdwatcher in Central Park on Wednesday morning . An ex-girlfriend says he bragged about killing Barbara Flake in the tiny West Virginia community of Jenkinjones, an impoverished and tightknit community in the state's southern coalfields. West Virginia State Police determined the woman died from a blow to the head when they found her skull two years after she disappeared from her home. But there was never enough information or probable cause to arrest Mitchell, said Sgt. C.F. Kane. Mitchell's onetime girlfriend, Saretta Mitchell, told The Associated Press that the man once bragged about killing Flake - a claim she reported to police when Flake's remains were found. 'In a social setting, when there's alcohol involved, he will tell you anything,' she said. 'He bragged to me and some of our friends at different times that he had murdered two people.' The rape charge against David Mitchell is just his latest brush with the law. Police in New York City say he raped a 73-year-old birdwatcher who took a compromising photo of him. Disgusting: The 42-year-old, pictured, spat as he was escorted out of the police building . Mitchell was arraigned early Friday on charges of first-degree rape, robbery, assault and other charges and ordered held without bail, prosecutors said. A call to his attorney at arraignment was not returned. Earlier, Mitchell said nothing as he was led from the special victims unit to face charges in court, but he spat at reporters gathered there. He was also charged with threatening a man last month with a knife in the same area of the park. He told the man, according to investigators: 'I have no problem stabbing you as many times as I want and making this circle full of blood.' Line up: The victim picked Mitchell, pictured, out of a line up today . Mitchell's disturbing criminal . history began when he was 18, when he was charged with molesting and beating . to death 87-year-old Annie Parks during a burglary in Jenkinjones, his . hometown. A jury did not convict him, but . months later he was accused of raping a woman in her 70s during another . home invasion reported the Charleston Gazette. Mitchell pleaded guilty to first-degree robbery in that trial and was sentenced to 10 years in prison, of which he served eight. After his release, the suspect was . arrested twice more and then was convicted of kidnapping in 2003 and was . sent to prison to serve an eight-year sentence. Over the past two years he has been . hauled in by police for probation violations and petty crimes, but had . not served a significant stretch in prison before coming to New York. Mitchell's sister-in-law and . ex-girlfriend Saretta Mitchell told the Associated Press that she was . the victim in the 2003 kidnapping and that Mitchell attempted to . sexually assault her. She said that his crimes 'were always sexually driven.' Police: Officers, pictured, cordoned off the area in Strawberry Fields yesterday . The victim in the Central Park attack told investigators she . believed a previous encounter with the man, where she took a photograph . of him exposing himself, may have prompted the gruesome attack, which . left her bruised and battered. She said her attacker asked, 'Do you . remember me?' before pushing her to the ground and raping her 'vaginally . and rectally' at about 11am in a wooded area near the park's tranquil . Strawberry Fields. The area serves as a memorial to John Lennon. In the horrific attack, the elderly . woman said she was thrown to the ground and sexually assaulted by the . man who then made off with her backpack, which contained her camera. He . also tried to steal her watch but was unsuccessful. Shaken up but mostly angry, the woman told The New York Post what punishment she believes her attacker deserves. 'Kill . him,' she said. 'Cut off his penis. That’s fine. Cut off his feet, then . hit him over the head. Then give him life in prison.

I hope he goes . to jail for a long time, and he gets raped, over and over again.' The woman, who regularly visits the . park, said she thinks the assailant was the same man she photographed . masturbating about 10 days ago in another, more isolated spot known as . The Ramble. She said he demanded she delete the . image before they went their separate ways during their previous . encounter, and tried to grab her camera but didn't succeed. Police said . that initial encounter wasn't reported. In yesterday's meeting, the woman said the man approached her and asked if she remembered him. When she said no, he attacked. 'He . pounced on me,' she told The Post. 'He jumped on my back... I started . screaming. And he said, ‘You don’t scream!’ And he grabbed my throat.'I . still screamed. ‘He said, ‘I’ll cut your jugular!’ I stopped screaming. Fleeing: After he allegedly raped the woman, he grabbed her bag and fled our of the park to Manhattan's Upper West Side . Then 'he raped me — vaginally and rectally. Brutally,' she said. After the rape, the man repeated, . 'I’ll cut your jugular. He mashed my head into the dirt. He said, ‘You . stay there and count to 100.’ I counted to 100. 'This guy knew what he wanted to do. He wanted to beat the s--t out of me. I think he’s beaten women before.' Eric Ozawa, a college professor and birdwatcher, found the woman and called 911. He . told reporters he noticed a pair of legs sticking out along the path . but thought it was somebody sleeping. As he got closer, he realized it . was a woman lying face down. Her face was badly swollen, she had a black . eye, a broken eye socket and was covered in mulch. NYPD: Police, pictured at the crime scene, have released video footage of the suspected rapist . Witness: Eric Ozawa, pictured, a college professor and birdwatcher, found the woman and called 911 . Still, she appeared 'self-possessed and lucid,' Ozawa said. After the woman told Ozawa she had been mugged and raped, he immediately called the police. 'It's shocking that it could happen in the park in broad daylight,' he said. 'That someone could rape somebody in her 70s.' Investigators interviewed Ozawa on Wednesday, while other officers and detectives swarmed the scene in search of the suspect. Police blocked off much of the area . near West 72nd Street and Central Park West as they hunted for a suspect . described as a man in his 40s. The . victim told The Post he spoke with a eastern European accent that may . have been Russian. Mitchell is believed to have an accent although he is . not Russian, DNA Info reported. Dangerous: Passersby were shocked that such an attack happened in the middle of the day . Park patrons: Crowds of onlookers, pictured, watched as investigators searched for evidence in Central Park . Authorities yesterday released surveillance images of the suspect who was wearing black pants, a black T-shirt and white sneakers. He was carrying a backpack that resembled the one stolen from the woman, and also wearing a second backpack. Alexander Stein, 48, who runs a picture booth nearby, told DNA Info he saw a police officer near Strawberry Fields get the call about the crime and race over, followed moments later by more squad cars and an ambulance. 'Things happen here every day,' Stein told the news website. 'But when police start running in every direction and ambulances come, you know something serious has happened.' Emily Loubaton, 29, was in the park on a scavenger hunt that her company had organized. 'I think this is pretty disgusting, and so shocking it would happen on such a beautiful day in such a beautiful park,' she said. Scene: The attack took place in a popular area of the park dedicated to John Lennon . Asked if she felt less safe in Central . Park, she said: 'I'd like to believe that New York City has turned the . corner for the better. I mean, this isn't the 70s. But it definitely . makes you pause before you walk in.' The victim told The Post that she wasn't frightened to return to Central Park and would not let the attacker stop her enjoying the area. 'I’m not scared. I don’t want to lose that pleasure. I won’t let anything keep me from enjoying the park,' she said. 'I’m not going back looking like this, but of course I’ll go back. It’s my park. I look like hell, but it will heal. I can see I’m alive.' But she admitted she may lose some sleep after the horrific attack. 'I know tonight, I will have a little trouble. I’ll feel the weight of him pushing me to the ground, and pummel, pummel, pummel,' she told the newspaper, punching the air around her.","David Albert Mitchell, 42, likely to be charged with rape after broad daylight incident .

"By . Julian Gavaghan . PUBLISHED: . 06:00 EST, 26 June 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 06:05 EST, 26 June 2012 . Call for action: Graham Aaronson QC said failing to stop 'aggressive' tax avoidance could spark social unrest . There will be ‘riots on the streets’ if the Government fails to tackle wealthy tax dodgers, the architect of new anti-avoidance rules has warned. Graham Aaronson QC, who has recommended banning ‘aggressive’ bill-reducing arrangements such as Jimmy Carr’s, said such practices were particularly wrong in an era of austerity. The tax-specialist barrister said that when he learned of the comedian’s K2 scheme - which helps members lower cut payments to about 1 per cent - it made his ‘blood boil’. He believes that ensuring the wealthy cannot ‘play fast and loose’ with their responsibility to contribute to the running of the country is essential to maintaining public order. ‘People on the street don’t want these schemes to go ahead,’ he said in an interview with The Times. ‘I feel very strongly that abusive tax schemes are antisocial and this sort of thing fuels the anger of the average person. ‘The tents have been pitched at St Paul’s and more riots in the streets are not far away if we don’t deal with this.’ Tax avoidance by individuals is estimated to cost the Treasury about £4.5billion a year. Corporations are believed to dodge an additional £30.5billion. To tackle this shortfall, Prime Minister David Cameron last year asked Mr Aaronson to decide whether Britain needed a general anti-avoidance rule (GAAR). Hackney burns: Mr Aaronson suggested riots like those in London last summer could be repeated . Mr Aaronson, who insists he pays around 50 per cent tax, recommended such a rule in November. He said it would improve HM Revenue and Customs' ability to tackle tax avoidance without damaging the competitiveness of the UK as a place to do business. In the Budget in March, Chancellor George Osborne said a GAAR was necessary. Treasury officials are now drafting legislation to put make the recommendation law. However, Mr Aaronson has rejected a ‘broad spectrum’ law that would tackle all schemes because, he argued, it would ‘undermine’ business. Sparking anger: News that Jimmy Carr, pictured on Friday, had saved £3.5m though a Jersey tax avoidance scheme has led to mounting pressure to close loopholes . Instead, avoidance arrangements falling foul of potential new rules would have to be seen as unreasonable on two levels. Senior HMRC officials are said to fear that Mr Aaronson’s plan does not go far enough. Calls for a firm crackdown have mounted since it was revealed 10 days ago that Mr Carr was among 1,100 K2 clients channelling their salaries though Jersey. Mr Cameron further fuelled the row when he said that the scheme used by the comedian, who sheltered £3.5million as a result, was ‘morally wrong’. Since then it has emerged that the Take That stars Gary Barlow, Howard Donald and Mark Owen, and their manager, poured £26million into another tax avoidance arrangement. Olympic champion cyclist Chris Hoy was also forced to deny dodging tax by taking a loan back though his own company. It has also emerged that 1,300 doctors are being investigated over allegations of tax evasion. At the weekend, Danny Alexander, the Chief Secretary to the Treasury, cutting Britain’s £35billion ‘tax gap’ by a quarter could fund a 2p cut for all basic-rate income taxpayers. It later emerged that the matter of investigating cases of ‘abusive’ avoidance may have been hampered by a shortage of tax inspectors due to cuts. A backlog of 20,000 cases could take up to 38 years to complete, officials warned. Mounting pressure to solve the cases was not helped by a strike by more than 50,000 HMRC workers yesterday. Walk-out: HMRC workers yesterday strikinbg over pay and pensions after it emerged tax inspectors are dealing with a backlog of 20,000 cases . The walk-out will be followed by other forms of action such as a ban on overtime. PCS general secretary Mark Serwotka said: 'It is sickening to see millionaires in the cabinet wringing their hands about the immorality of tax avoidance when it is their lack of political will to act that means we lose tens of billions of pounds every year. 'The case for investment in our public services as an alternative to austerity could not be more obvious than it is in HMRC. ‘Yet the government wants to cut 10,000 more jobs from the department, letting the wealthy tax dodgers off the hook and punishing the rest of us for a recession we did not cause.'","Graham Aaronson QC recommends banning 'aggressive' tax dodges .

Squatters have moved into one of London's oldest pubs in London previously frequented by Agatha Christie, Dylan Thomas and Bob Marley - and plan to make it popular again by serving Sunday lunches. The 300-year-old Cross Keys pub in Chelsea was boarded up by its owner Andrew Bourne earlier this year after it stopped making a profit. Mr Bourne planned to turn the building into a £10million residential complex with a swimming pool but was refused planning permission. Closed up: The 300-year-old Cross Keys Pub in Chelsea was closed by its owner after it stopped making a profit . But 17 squatters have taken over the building and are exempt from a new law giving the police the power to arrest them for squatting in a residential property as the pub remains commercial. The group, all aged between 17 and 36, insist they plan to turn the property into an art gallery and public library while also serving up Sunday lunch. Portuguese theatre student Mariana Costa, 28, said: 'This is a commercial property which is boarded up and empty so we can squat here. We have welcomed many members of the community in and everyone seems quite happy about us being here. 'I work and I'm a student. I have rented before in London recently but found that in order to survive I have to work many hours a week in order to pay the rent and my grades began to slip as I was working when I should have been studying.' In a note attached to the outside of the building, which has been boarded up since the summer, the squatters wrote: 'Hello neighbours, we are your friendly local squatters. New residents: 17 squatters, aged between 17 and 36, have moved in to the property and plan to turn it into an art gallery where they serve Sunday lunches . 'I can assure you that we are quiet and respectful and we would love to seamlessly become a part of your community. We are keeping your pub safe and tidy until it is going to be used again.' A spokesman for the Chelsea Society, which has been campaigning to save some of the area's historic pubs, told the London Informer: 'There really is delicious irony in this as Andrew Bourne failed to turn it into a residence, but now against his will it has indeed turned into one for squatters. 'The squatters really couldn't be nicer and say they won't allow anyone in who is a nuisance. They are very courteous and polite and have offered us a Sunday roast and say they want to turn the space into an art gallery.' But Mr Bourne said it was 'outrageous' that the squatters could move into the pub. He told the Evening Standard: 'The notice they have put on the door is rubbish and the police have been called out by neighbours some three times already. It has brought crime to the area. 'They are professional squatters who know exactly what they are doing. They will be gone in a week or so, I think they will probably walk out after November 5.'","The 300-year-old Cross Keys pub in Chelsea was first opened in 1708 .

A female bartender who was brutally beaten by a drunken off-duty cop twice her size was awarded $850,000 in damages on Tuesday. Karolina Obrycka of Chicago was attacked by Anthony Abbate, a Chicago police officer, in February 2007, while his friends watched. A surveillance video of Abbate pushing Obrycka to the ground and then repeatedly punching and kicking her behind the bar she worked at went viral online. Scroll down for videos . Assault victim: Bartender Karolina Obrycka, left, talks to the media while her attorney Terry Ekl, right, looks on during a news conference in Chicago on Tuesday, Nov. 13, 2012 . The surveillance video, which became a major embarrassment for Chicago police, shined a spotlight on allegations of abuse by the city's officers. Amid accusations that police dithered in the weeks after the beating, then-superintendent Phil Cline retired and the department vowed to clean up its image. Chicago police adhered to a strict code of silence protecting fellow officers as a federal jury awarded the $850,000 in damages Obrycka at her civil trial on Tuesday. The civil trial in federal court in . Chicago was the first of its kind to focus almost wholly on the question . of whether there is such an ingrained code - with most of the 2 1/2 . weeks of testimony devoted to that question. But he said he never . presented himself as an officer that night or asserted he had special . off-duty privileges. Surveillance video: Anthony Abbate, a Chicago police officer, punches Obrycka from behind the bar she was working at . Surveillance video: Abbate beats Obrycka further . Surveillance video: Abbate kicks Obrycka . VIDEO: Karolina Obrycka is brutally beaten by off-duty cop . Abbate was convicted of aggravated battery in 2009, and sentenced to probation. Testimony during his criminal trial suggested that he attacked Obrycka after he walked behind the bar and she told him to leave. At the civil trial, Obrycka was asking jurors to hold Abbate and the city liable for damages to compensate her for any pain or distress she suffered. Jurors sided with her after listening to weeks of testimony. 'I'm still in shock,' Obrycka said outside the courtroom after the verdict, adding that she hopes she can move on with her life now. The brute: Anthony Abbate, a former Chicago police officer convicted for the 2007 beating of Obrycka, leaves a federal building after the first day of a civil trial stemming from a lawsuit filed against him and the city by Obrycka . Obrycka's attorney, Terry Ekl, heralded the verdict as a landmark, precedent-setting decision. 'We proved the code of silence at every level of the Chicago Police Department,' from the first officers who responded to the beating to then-Chief Phil Cline, Ekl said after the verdict. Ekl said the onus was now on Mayor Rahm Emanuel to end that culture of protection and silence. 'The question now becomes, what are they going to do about it?' he said. 'If there's going to be change, it has to come from the mayor's office.' Justice served: Obrycka hugs her attorney Terry Ekl after she was awarded $850,000 in damages by jurors . During the civil trial, her attorneys alleged that police sought to downplay and cover up the beating, in part out of an ingrained but shadowy culture among police of protecting their own. They said that culture emboldened Abbate and created an environment that led to the beating. City attorneys countered by telling jurors there was no evidence that such a secret code existed. The fact that Abbate was eventually charged and convicted, they said, proved that the system worked. But some police officials who testified contradicted each other, which Obrycka's attorney said proved their point about alleged cover-ups. Debra Kirby, who headed the department's internal affairs division at the time, testified that she recommended during a phone call three days after the beating to a Cook County prosecutors that Abbate be charged with a serious felony. Pressed by Ekl about whether she told the prosecutor she actually thought a misdemeanor battery charge was appropriate, Kirby emphatically denied it. 'Absolutely incorrect,' she said firmly. But less than an hour later, Joseph Stehlik, who was an internal affairs detective under Kirby's command, said he was next to his boss at the time of the call. Stehlik testified Kirby recommended the lesser charge. Then when the prosecutor in question, Tom Bilyk, took the stand, he told jurors the call never happened and that he never talked with Kirby about charges. Because Abbate was off duty during the beating, Obrycka's attorneys needed to persuade jurors that the silence code exists, that it was sanctioned by the city and that it led to the beating and an attempted cover-up. Abbate was on the witness stand for two days and asked by Obrycka's attorney about phone records showing he made dozens of calls to fellow officers in the hours after the beating. He said he was so drunk before the attack that he couldn't remember calling anyone or what he might have said, though he insisted he 'didn't tell anyone to do anything regarding the incident.' Abbate claimed he was bent on drowning his sorrows that day because he had just learned his dog was dying from cancer, telling jurors: 'I was on a mission to get inebriated.' But he said he never presented himself as an officer that night or asserted he had special off-duty privileges.

Young mother Dawn Graves saved her baby by pushing his pram out of the path of a recycling lorry but was killed in the accident herself . A brave mother 'sacrificed her own life' to save her baby from being hit by a recycling truck, just weeks before she was due to marry her partner. Dawn Graves, 25, pushed the pram, with her 20-month-old son Aidan, out of its path, but died after she was hit by the vehicle herself, an inquest has heard. She suffered multiple injuries - described as 'unsurvivable' - as she crossed a street in the Breightmet area of Bolton, Greater Manchester, in May. Deputy coroner Alan Walsh said that the mother-of-two gave no thought to the danger to herself as she pushed her son to safety. Witness Thomas Grimshaw said he flagged down the lorry driver - who was unaware of the accident - and his partner, Rachel Bell, rushed to help stricken Miss Graves. Miss Graves had been to a local shop and Miss Bell said she saw her with what appeared to be a bag of sweets. Miss Bell told the inquest: 'She was just stepping off the pavement and she continued to walk. 'She was fiddling with what appeared to be some sweets as she pushed the pram.' She said she saw Miss Graves push the pram out of the way and then saw her fall to the ground. 'It was all very quick,' she added. When asked if she felt the driver could have avoided the accident Miss Bell said 'no'. A distressed Mr Grimshaw said the vehicle was driving 'slowly' and he managed to get the driver’s attention who brought the lorry to a halt. Mr Grimshaw said that the vehicle had been in full view. Jordan Kay-Haworth, who was taking a break . from work at a barber’s shop close to the scene, said that he saw the young mother leave . the shop, look, then carry on walking and estimated the lorry speed as . being either four or five miles an hour. He said that she had 'momentarily looked down' but said he could not say . for certain if a van parked outside the shop could have obstructed Miss . Graves’ view of the lorry. The recycling truck which collided with Ms Graves comes to a halt outside the corner shop after the collision in Bolton, Greater Manchester in May . Police attend to the pushchair belonging to Ms Graves, while right, the milk she bought at the shop is still visible at the scene of the collision . Lorry driver Eric Hamilton, who is not facing any charges following the accident, told the court he had done all required routine checks on his vehicle before leaving his Bury depot on the morning of May 24, including checks on the mirrors. He had been heading home for a lunchtime sandwich when he stopped to allow a pedestrian, Isatu Jalloh, to cross in front of him, but he did not see Miss Graves. 'I was devastated,' said Mr Hamilton, who explained how Mr Grimshaw had flagged him down. 'My legs were like jelly and I had to sit down.' Although a close proximity mirror on the vehicle was found to be incorrectly aligned, experts were unable to say if its correct position would have helped Mr Hamilton to see Miss Graves. The court heard Miss Graves had been looking forward to her wedding to her partner, Barry Guest, in August. She was also studying with the hope of getting a job. Her mother, Audrey Ashmore, from Horwich, said her daughter had been more settled than she had ever been in her life. Recording a verdict that Miss Graves’ death was a result of an accident, Mr Walsh said that she had 'sacrificed her own life for the benefit of her son' and recognised the terrible scene that had met the witnesses. He said: 'I believe what happened was horrific for the witnesses. Dawn suffered unsurvivable injuries.'

Banking giant RBS could leave Scotland if Alex Salmond succeeds with his bid to break up Britain, its chairman warned last night. Sir Philip Hampton confirmed the bank would move elsewhere if separation brought ‘extra difficulties’ or cost pressures. In a chilling warning, he said that ‘small countries don’t often have big banks’. The loss of one of the country’s biggest . companies would be an economic disaster, costing 14,000 jobs. If it did . quit Scotland, its mostly likely new home would be London, the financial . capital of Europe. Could RBS walk out of Scotland? Its chairman has warned that such a scenario is not out of the question . As well as those based at RBS, it could also force the collapse of Scottish firms that supply the Edinburgh-based banking giant and are reliant on its business. The Royal Bank of Scotland Group, which includes NatWest, has 26million customers in the UK. Opponents said the comments put more pressure on the SNP to lay out the implications of independence for individuals and businesses. During an appearance in the House of Lords, Sir Philip said the company had no current plans to move out of Scotland, but admitted that the position could change after any referendum that led to the end of the Union. Despite its headquarters being in Scotland, Sir Philip pointed out that only 3-4  per cent of the RBS group’s customers are in Scotland. He said that, should difficulties arise, it would have to reconsider its 300-year connection with the country. He also called for more clarity on what would happen if Scotland becomes independent. RBS Chaiman Sir Philip Hampton (left) said that if Scottish independence caused the bank 'extra difficulties' they would think about 'alternatives'. It was a veiled warning to Scottish First Minister Alex Salmond (right) Alex Salmond hit out at the UK Government today, claiming the 'complacency' of Chancellor George Osborne was the 'biggest danger to the economy'. He accused the Westminster Government of 'basking in the Olympics afterglow' while it was 'still clear that what is needed is a direct capital investment stimulus to boost the economy'. Mr Osborne will deliver his autumn statement next month and Mr Salmond said the rising jobless figures meant it was 'ever more critical' for him to 'take meaningful action to bring jobs and growth to the UK economy'. Mr Salmond said: 'The biggest danger to the economy is the complacency of George Osborne. 'He should remember that the positive effect of the Olympics on employment will only last a few months whilst the impact of the decisions he makes in this forthcoming autumn statement will last for years.' Mr Salmond said the number of people out of work and claiming benefits was 'unchanged' across the UK over the last year. He added: 'It is time the Chancellor faced the reality that as a result of his decisions the UK's economy is flat-lining. 'It would be a tragedy for Scotland, and for the UK as a whole, if the positive impact of the Olympics is used to justify continued inaction by the UK Government. 'An extra £5billion in capital investment across the UK would allow us to provide an additional stimulus of more than £400million to support employment in Scotland now.' Scotland Office Minister David Mundell said it was a 'cause for obvious concern that the latest Scottish figures show another increase in unemployment while it is falling in the rest of the UK'. Sir Philip was giving evidence to the Economic Affairs Committee, as part of its inquiry into the impact of Scottish independence. He told peers: ‘The overriding requirement is to serve our customers and to produce the best value we can for shareholders. 'We have no intention or plan to relocate from Scotland.’ Sir Philip said that even during the financial crisis the bank was ‘happy to be domiciled in Edinburgh’, but warned: ‘If, as a result of independence, we found extra difficulties or cost pressures or whatever arising from that, then we would have to think about alternatives.’ The UK Government, which owns 82 per cent of RBS, is almost certain still to have a large shareholding when the referendum takes place in 2014. That means that, if Scots vote Yes, it would then be owned by a foreign government. Under the SNP’s current  economic vision, an  independent Scotland would remain within a ‘sterling zone’ where the Bank of England would continue to be its ‘lender of last resort’. Sir Philip admitted international money markets would be concerned about the issue, but pointed out that RBS received support during the banking crisis from foreign governments, including $90million from the US Federal Reserve. SNP claims that independence would significantly boost growth were dismissed by a senior RBS executive. Giving evidence, head of group economic affairs Stephen Boyle said independence or staying in the Union would make  little difference and would be ‘economically neutral’. A spokesman for the pro-Union Better Together campaign said: ‘This is exactly why Alex Salmond needs to present exactly how independence will work. 'We can’t wait until November next year for his much-heralded White Paper to give the detail that individuals and businesses need.’ During a recent speech, former Chancellor Alistair  Darling accused Mr Salmond of ‘cooking the books’ on his arguments for separation. He also said that separating from the rest of the UK could force some of Scotland’s financial giants to move out of the country. Mr Darling said: ‘Uncertainty will . damage business. Sooner or later, a Scottish firm with 90 per cent of . its business somewhere else is going to ask itself:  Is staying worth . the cost?’ A spokesman for . Finance Secretary John Swinney said: ‘Sir Philip made it absolutely . clear RBS’ home is in Scotland and will remain so. 'There . is no evidence to suggest an independent Scotland will offer anything . other than positive opportunities for all businesses, including the . banking sector.’ An RBS branch in central London: The bank has been based in Scotland for over 300 years, but only 3-4 per cent of its customers are there .","RBS chairman Sir Philip Hampton said bank would move elsewhere if separation brought cost pressures .

Catherine, faces a world ban after a failed drugs test . French authorities were 'tipped off' that Frankie Dettori – Britain's best-known jockey – had taken a banned substance, it emerged today. The 41-year-old three-time champion jockey was shocked when officials demanded a drugs test and has been left devastated by the failure that is threatening to derail his career. He faces a hearing before the medical committee of the French racing authorities next week after testing positive for cocaine or a derivative of it while riding Longchamp on September 16. A well-placed racing source in Paris told the Evening Standard today that Dettori 'was taken by surprise by the test, following a tip-off from a third party'. Dettori is currently in Dubai, where he has stopped off after riding in the Melbourne Cup on November 6. Sources have told the Daily Mail the Italian has been ‘knocked for six’ by the positive test, which was ‘a moment of madness rather than a genuine addiction.’ Dettori’s withdrawal from his mounts at Doncaster on Saturday was unrelated to the imminent disciplinary hearing. However, Coral has removed Dettori from its 2013 champion jockey betting with the threat of a long ban hanging over him. Fellow jockey Kieran Fallon was handed a six-month ban by the France Galop in 2006 when he tested positive to cocaine for the first time. A ban of such magnitude, which would not start until Dettori’s disciplinary process was completed, would potentially rule out Dettori until May or June of next year. Coral spokesman David Stevens said: ‘If, as reports suggest, Frankie Dettori has failed a test involving cocaine, a six-month suspension is likely, and such a ban would rule him out of a title bid next year.’ The revelation has caused a sensation . in the racing world. Dettori, famous for his exuberance and flying . dismount, was awarded an MBE in 2000 and has become a major TV . celebrity. He was a one-time captain on the BBC's A Question of Sport and co-owner of a restaurant with chef Marco Pierre White. In the dock: The 41-year-old tested positive for a . prohibited substance following a meeting at Longchamp racecourse in . Paris in September, where he took part in four races . A . three-time champion jockey, he has won more than 500 group races in his . career. But his exploits in the saddle achieved legendary status at . Ascot in 1996, when he won all seven races in a row. In an interview, Detorri said: 'I . won the last race on Fujiyama Crest. I bought him when he retired and . now he lives peacefully in my field. 'My wife Catherine made me a bronze . cast of his foot – it reminds me of the wonderful horse that made me . famous.' Under reciprocal arrangements in place . between international racing authorities, any ban imposed in one . country would apply internationally. Dettori's solicitor, . Christopher Stewart-Moore, said in a statement: 'I can confirm that, as a consequence . of a positive test at Longchamp on September 16, he will be the subject . of an inquiry by the Medical Committee of France Galop next week. Frankie's folly: Frankie Dettori rides ex-racehorse Monsignor, left, to carry the Olympic Flame around the parade ring at Ascot Racecourse.

'In compliance with, and out of . respect for, the regulations of France Galop he will not be commenting . further until the France Galop procedures have been completed.' Dettori and his wife, with whom he has five children, were not at their home near Newmarket, Suffolk, last night. A relative who answered the door said: . 'I don't know anything about it. Frankie is in Los Angeles and . Catherine is in Hertfordshire with one of the children.' The jockey parted company with racing stable Godolphin last month after an 18-year relationship. Dettori was expected to continue . working his contract until the end of this year but Godolphin said at . the time that 'the retainer was not really working'. In 1993, Dettori . received a caution for possession of cocaine after he had been to watch . Arsenal and Sheffield Wednesday play at Wembley in the FA Cup final. Speaking about it in 2010, he said: 'That wasn't about losing weight. That was for fun.' Describing how a 'fast' lifestyle took . over from his focus on horse racing when he began earning big money, he . added: 'Everyone wanted to be with me. I'd go clubbing, there was . cocaine and there I was like the big show-off, the idiot.' Sporting minds: In 2002 Frankie became a team captain on A Question of Sport . Family man: Frankie with wife Catherine son Leo and daughter Ella at the premiere of The Chronicles Of Narnia in December 2005 . The jockey also had a professional DJ . booth built in his home. He said: 'It started off as a bit of a joke, . but now I can't imagine life without it. 'When we have people round and the . champagne's flowing I start playing music, but I usually get kicked off . pretty fast because everybody wants a go.' The race day at Longchamp in September . is used to trial horses for the highlight of the racecourse's calendar, . the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe, which is held in October. He finished second in one race, third in two others and was unplaced in the fourth. Jockey Kieren Fallon was banned for . six months by France Galop in 2006 after a positive test.

David Peters, pictured at Hereford magistrate's court earlier this week, is accused of racially abusing a black anti-blood sports protester . A hunt master hurled racist abuse at a black anti-blood sports protester, calling her a 'f****** w**', a court heard. David Lee Peters, 33, hurled insults at a group of ‘saboteurs’ who gathered in 4x4 vehicles to voice their protests at a meet in Ross-on-Wye, Herefordshire, on January 7. The married father-of-one - who is the master of the Ross Harriers hunt - went on to abuse protester Hiba Hassan and call her a f****** w** as he rode past on horseback, JPs were told. A court heard Peters, also known as Lee, had called police to disperse the protesters who claimed they were monitoring for illegal hunting. But he was arrested when the anti-hunting group told officers about the alleged racist slur. Today Peters, from Ross-on-Wye, appeared before Hereford Magistrates Court charged with racially aggravated harassment. Addressing him prosecutor Michael Taylor said: 'You tried to take a look inside the Land Rover. 'You even went to look in the back and when you saw a black person you shouted out ""look there’s a f*****g w** in there"". 'Presumably loud enough to impress the people behind you.' Giving evidence Ms Hassan told the court she was on her first hunt protest and was left 'upset' by the insult. She said: 'Mr Peters began banging on the Land Rover and shouting at us. 'I heard him say ""you’re going to get it"" and he called me a ""w**"" when he saw me. 'He saw me and then he said ""they’ve got a f*****g w** in there"". 'He was aggressive the whole way through. Everyone was in hearing distance. 'I felt very alienated and upset and shocked. I don’t think people use the word ‘w**’ in this day and age. 'Less . than an hour later the police officer approached me. They asked me if I . had any trouble and if I’d experienced any abusive behaviour from . anyone and I said yes I had, I said the hunt master had been abusive . towards me. 'I was quite upset at the time.' Witness Robert Muncey told the court he was tending to his garden when the incident occurred. He said: 'The lead rider crouched down as he came passed the Land Rover looking in the cab window. He then crouched around by the back window. 'He yelled out the following to the riders behind him: ""Oh look, they’ve got a f*****g w** in here"". 'It was said very loudly in a venomous manner. I couldn’t believe what I had heard. I really thought there was going to be trouble.' Peters admitted shouting some threats towards the group as he passed them on horseback but denied using racist language. Peters, pictured on a horse at an earlier meet of the Ross Harriers, allegedly called a woman a 'f****** w**' in January this year . He also claimed he was verbally abused himself by the group who labelled him a 'Welsh sheep s******* c***'. Giving evidence he said: 'I was told . that there were ‘sabs’ (saboteurs) present. The information I had was . that they had baseball bats. 'I . phoned the police and just told them the information I had. As soon as . you’re aware of saboteurs, it’s my duty as a master to inform the . police. 'We left the pub and went around the bend and there’s some saboteurs to my left hand side just parked up really. 'I did not stop because I had the hounds around me. 'And I didn’t say those words, I didn’t hear those words. 'Then . I retraced my steps back up the lane.

A conman who sold potentially dangerous tooth-whitening gel which contained up to 100 times the legal level of cleaning chemical hydrogen peroxide has been jailed for 16 months. Barrington Armstrong-Thorpe, 68, was found guilty of eight consumer protection offences after a judge told him he had 'lied' his way through a week-long trial. Armstrong-Thorpe, from Clacton, Essex, who is known to have used 17 aliases, had bought the gel for his online company Brighter Smile Marketing from America and claimed on its websites that the product complied with EU laws. The websites, brightersmile.co.uk and . smilebrighternow.com, also failed to include information identifying . the trader or the customer's consumer rights. Essex . Trading Standards officers tested the whitening syringes and analysis . showed that they were 69, 89 and 100 times over the EU permitted limit . of 0.1 per cent hydrogen peroxide. Armstrong-Thorpe had denied the charges but was found guilty on all counts at Chelmsford Crown Court. Sentencing the trader, Judge Karen Walden Smith said: 'I have never heard someone lie as you did with barely a pause for breath. 'The business was organised for the purpose of making money and to do so you lied and lied without concern for the public. 'Your concern throughout has been your profit.' The . court heard that Armstrong-Thorpe, who appeared in court on crutches . because of a bad back, had received 190,000 US dollars in a PayPal . account between 2007 and 2010, the only figure that prosecutors could . establish. He began selling the kits, which costs 'tens of pounds', in 2004 and thousands of customers purchased them. But despite those sales, Barry . Gilbert, mitigating, said that not much money had been made from the . product and that Armstrong-Thorpe had been declared bankrupt. He added that the product had worked as customers had continuously reordered and said that no complaints had ever been made. A . spokesman for Essex Trading Standards however, said peroxide was . absorbed through the teeth into the body and it was not known what long . term damage could be caused by excessive levels. Armstrong-Thorpe, . who described himself as a chiropractor and had arranged for his dog to . be put down as he knew a prison term was likely, had previously served . four years in a Los Angeles jail for perjury in 1993 and has a list of . offences going back to 1967, the court heard.

Armstrong-Thorpe had been selling the products, pictured here, online since 2004 . Armstrong-Thorpe had bought the teeth whitening kits from America and despite thousands of customers buying them, was declared bankrupt according to defence lawyers . Since his conviction an announcement . had been posted on the Smilebrighter website stating: 'Unfortunately due . to circumstances beyond our control we have had to suspend orders for a . short while. 'We will be back shortly as soon as we can sort the problem out.' Essex . Councillor Kevin Bentley, who is responsible for Trading Standards in . the county, warned after the verdict: 'Using unfamiliar websites to . purchase unfamiliar goods for a cheap price may put you at risk. 'Teeth whitening gel such as this could cause permanent damage and be extremely expensive to put right.' 'This conviction should act as a warning to other traders who may be trying to make money by selling these illegal goods. 'You will be caught and potentially get a prison sentence.' He was found guilty of eight separate offences relating to two different websites, one is pictured .

A blind man was beaten around the face with a brick after he said hello to two men in the street. Michael Chaplin and Darrell Hughes left the 21-year-old with multiple facial fractures after they hit him repeatedly with the brick. The victim fled for his life as the two thugs then turned on his father, who had been walking home with his son. The pair used a 'for sale' sign to beat him to the ground. Chaplin, 21, and Hughes, 19, were jailed yesterday at Hull Crown Court for what the judge called 'an appalling episode'. Appalling: Judge Jeremy Richardson said Darrell Hughes, 19,  pictured left, and Michael Chaplin, 21, pictured right, showed 'no mercy' to their victims and deserved little themselves . Chaplin and Hughes started the attack after the visually impaired man said 'alright lads' as he and his father walked him from watching an England football match on television. The victim is partially sighted but registered blind. After he fled he broke down in tears believing his father had been killed in the unprovoked attack near their home in Hull. In a statement read to the court, the man said of the June attack: 'I was just terrified. I feared for my life and my dad’s life. 'My instinct was to flee. I know it’s not a very brave thing to do but I just thought I was going to die. 'I genuinely thought my dad was dead because they had said they were going to kill him.' The court heard the attack began when Hughes spat at the blind man and shouted: 'I’ve just spat at you, what are you going to do about it?' He then told the man’s father: 'I will stab you.' Both Hughes and Chaplin punched the blind man in the face as his father tried to lure them away. Hughes ran after the father and beat him six times with the sign. Hughes and Chaplin kicked him more than 20 times, before stealing his shoes. Chaplin, who knew the son was blind, then picked up a brick and struck him with it three times in the face. The son ran home believing his father had been killed. In his statement, the son said: 'I was running into pitch darkness and I just thought they were going to kill me.' The court heard he managed to find his way home, as the attack happened in nearby Spring Bank. 'They told me to run and I didn’t stop running until I got home,' he said. 'When I got home my dad wasn’t there and I thought he was dead. I cried my eyes out, I was hysterical.' Unprovoked: The blind man and his father were walking home along Spring Bank, in Hull, pictured, when they were set upon by the two thugs . Meanwhile, his father managed to escape and was frantically looking for his son. When he staggered home in bare feet and found his son, he collapsed and an ambulance was called. The father suffered cuts to his eye and swelling to his face. The attack happened as the father and son walked home from the city after an England football match on TV. Chaplin, of Ella Street, west Hull, pleaded guilty to causing grievous bodily harm on the son and assault occasioning actual bodily harm on the father and has been jailed for five years. Hughes, of Peel Street, west Hull, admitted wounding the son and assault occasioning actual bodily harm on the father and has been jailed for three years. Judge Jeremy Richardson QC told them: 'There was no provocation for your conduct. 'Chaplin, you picked up a brick and hit him - a visually impaired young man - three times in the face. 'He fell and was kicked. He was utterly terrified for his life. 'This appalling episode would be appalling for anyone without disabilities but for a young man with a visible impairment, it was much, much worse. 'You both set about his father. 'The injuries to the son were serious but they could have been much worse. He was particularly vulnerable due to his disability and it was a sustained attack upon him. 'This crime was in a public place late at night when individuals and members of the public should be expected to return home without being set upon by violent thugs. 'Both of you deserve to be punished severely for what you did. 'You showed no mercy to your victims and you deserve little mercy yourselves.' Chaplin has a previous conviction for causing actual bodily harm in 2008 when he headbutted a man as his friend filmed it. Hughes has a conviction for battery after he punched his father last year and grabbed his mother by the throat.","Visually impaired son and his father were attacked after he said hello to them in the street .

The official has been accused of racially abusing Mikel . The police yesterday shelved their race abuse investigation into referee Mark Clattenburg after receiving no complaint from Chelsea. The Metropolitan Police have confirmed they are no longer investigating a complaint, made by the Society of Black Lawyers, regarding Clattenburg’s conduct. The FA inquiry finished on Friday and they have since been receiving legal opinion on a draft document. It has been delayed due to the vast amount of paperwork involved. Chelsea submitted 1,250 pages of evidence delivered by bike courier to the FA’s three-man compliance unit when John Terry was accused of racially abusing Anton Ferdinand — a charge he was later found guilty of by the FA. Poster boys: United fans poke fun at the famous Chelsea banner, which reads 'JT, captain, leader, legend', during the Capital One Cup tie . They have a full-time QC amongst their employees and it is believed the club will have been equally as thorough with this case. If, as expected, Clattenburg, 37, is cleared by the FA it will leave Chelsea's reputation in tatters after their captain John Terry was banned for four matches and . fined £220,000 after being found guilty of racially abusing QPR's Anton . Ferdinand by a Football Association independent regulatory commission. Hours after reporting Clattenburg to the FA, a spectator in the Chelsea end was pictured directing a 'monkey' gesture at Manchester United striker Danny Welbeck during a Capital One Cup tie. Gavin Kirkham, 28, is on police bail pending a further investigation following his arrest on suspicion of a racially aggravated Section 4A Public Order Act offence. Chelsea have banned him from Stamford Bridge until the police investigation is concluded and he faces a life-ban if found guilty. Whistleblower: Chelsea have stood by their allegation that Clattenburg (right) used inappropriate language in an exchange with Mikel . Mr Kirkham is due back in police custody on November 29 where he will either be charged and will go to court, re-bailed pending further investigation or released without charge. Clattenburg has not officiated in a match since the incident. But some refereeing experts have suggested he will be handed a last-minute match in the lower leagues this weekend in an under-the-radar bid to assimilate the Durham official back into officiating. Chelsea chairman: Bruce Buck . The incident occurred in Chelsea’s 3-2 Barclays Premier League loss to Manchester United on October 28. Chelsea came from two goals behind to level at 2-2 before having Branislav Ivanovic and Fernando Torres sent off. Afterwards Chelsea accused Clattenburg of the racial slur on Mikel – who angrily stormed into his dressing room and confronted him after the match – and of calling Juan Mata a ‘Spanish t***’. The club later dropped the accusation against Mata but pressed ahead and reported the comment about Mikel to the FA. Yesterday, in an interview with the Evening Standard, Chelsea chairman Bruce Buck stood by the club's allegation levelled at Clattenburg. 'We . were guided by obligations that are imposed by the Football Association . and also as an employer. FA rule E14 basically says a participant shall . immediately report to the association any incident or matter which may . be considered to be a misconduct.

A former Miss Britain competitor falsely claimed thousands of pounds in benefits as a single parent when she was in fact living with her boyfriend, a court has heard. Rachel Hatton, 29, told South Northamptonshire Council that her alleged partner, Nathaniel Simon, was just her landlord when she moved into a four-bedroom house owned and lived in by him. The pair claimed Simon slept in a caravan on the driveway of the house while she lived inside because he needed to rent his property to help pay off his mortgage. Former Miss Great Britain contestant Rachel Hatton, pictured left arriving at Northampton Crown Court, falsely claimed thousands of pounds in benefits as a single parent when she was allegedly living with her boyfriend . She made claims for council tax and housing benefit, legal aid and income support, and was awarded £511 to cover the £675 monthly rent, Northampton Crown Court heard. Prosecutor Laura Hobson told the jury that it was not a 'commercial landlord-tenant arrangement' and the pair were actually involved in a romantic relationship. She said the pair should have informed the council about their relationship because it would have affected the amount of benefits Hatton received. Blonde-haired Hatton, who appeared in court today wearing a black skirt and jacket and stiletto heels, hit the headlines in 2010 after becoming the first single parent/divorcee to be allowed to enter the Miss Great Britain competition. The mother of one won the regional title of Miss Warwickshire before going on to the finals of the contest. Standing trial: Beauty queen Rachel Hatton, pictured left, who told South Northamptonshire Council  that her alleged boyfriend Nathaniel Simon, pictured right, was just her landlord when she moved into his house . Winner: Rachel Hatton was the first single mother to take part in the Miss Great Britain competition after coming first in a regional contest . Simon, 36, who also owned and rented out a number of other properties, did not make her pay for any utility bills or make up the shortfall in the rent for the house in Foxfield Way, Grange Park, Northampton, the court heard. The court heard extracts from interviews carried out by investigators from the Department for Work and Pensions with Hatton in February and March last year. She told them she and her son previously lived in a house in Newport Pagnell, which was also owned by and rented from Simon, after she separated from her husband. When the house in Northampton came up she said she was keen to take it because she wanted to move back to the area. The court heard that Hatton told investigators she had slept with Simon a couple of times but had never been in a relationship with him. 'Just a tenant': Hatton, pictured posing for the camera, told the Department for Work and Pensions that Simon lived in a caravan on the driveway while she rented his property for her and her son . Model looks: Hatton allegedly wrongly claimed council tax, housing benefit, legal aid and income support . 'I’ve never had a relationship with Nathaniel,' she said in interview. 'He’s not the sort of guy I would want a relationship with, to be honest. 'He’s my landlord. I can probably understand how it looks now I’ve been brought in but there’s no relationship at all.' He ended up living in the caravan, she said, because his work situation changed and he could not afford the mortgage on the house and needed some extra income from renting. Hatton described herself as a 'convenience' to him as he was paid rent while making improvements to the house with an intention to sell. She told investigators the situation between them was 'open and flexible' - Simon had a key to the property and they would sometimes eat together or watch television in the evening, and she occasionally did his washing. 'Convenient': Hatton claimed she paid rent while her landlord Simon continued to carry out home improvements so he could eventually sell the property in Grange Park, Northampton . He was also insured to drive her white Audi car and the pair had been on holiday together to Turkey. Hatton also told investigators: 'We were definitely friends but I’ve not realised until now that all these things I’ve been doing in your eyes have been wrong.' In interviews with Simon, the court heard he described their involvement as an 'off-off relationship' and he had been doing a lot to try to win her heart. Hatton, of Foxfield Way, denies one count of making false representation, two counts of fraud by failing to disclose information and a further count of fraud by false representation over a two-year period between 2009 and 2011 in relation to the benefits claims. Simon, of the same address, denies furnishing false information in relation to the tenancy agreement he and Hatton had, and another charge of fraud by failing to disclose information. In court: Hatton denies fraud by false representation and failing to disclose information .

Multiple inquiries: Dorothy Seecoomar, 81, died 40 hours after being in the care of a doctor who was intoxicated, according to claims . Three inquiries have been launched into claims that an out-of-hours doctor was too intoxicated to operate the oxygen supply of a frail and elderly woman, who died hours later. It is alleged the doctor arrived 'incoherent' with bloodshot eyes, and phoned a hospital medic for help but appeared not to understand his instructions. The following day Dorothy Seecoomar, 81, was admitted to hospital, and she died 24 hours later on August 17. The doctor had been sent by Harmoni, the largest private provider of urgent care services in England. Following complaints by the hospital medic and Dorothy's daughter Agnes, Harmoni spent more than two months investigating the doctor. He left the company last week although the organisation's internal inquiry 'found no indication of any alcohol or drug abuse'. Ms Seecoomar, a teacher from West London, said her mother had suffered unnecessary distress and pain in her final hours. She told MailOnline: 'My mother suffered because her breathing was becoming more laboured. This could have been alleviated. Any competent doctor would have seen that she was not getting enough oxygen. 'This doctor was incoherent and his eyes were severely bloodshot. It wasn't just me, two of my mother's carers were there at the time. 'My mother was using quite a noisy oxygen concentrator. He said: ""Is she on oxygen?"" I said: ""Are you ok doctor?"", because clearly he wasn't. 'He called the registrar at St Georges hospital and obviously couldn't answer his questions, he was rambling, so I took the phone and spoke to the registrar myself and I said, ""look this man is incapable and I'm frightened"". 'My mother remained in discomfort. I hoped they would send somebody else after I had reported this doctor as being drunk. Dorothy Seecoomar meeting Conservative MP Justine Greening in Putney two months before her death, having discussed disability transport issues previously. Ms Greening has since offered support to her daughter Agnes . 'I had to call Harmoni the next . day as the GP surgery was shut,and I was unable to get a respiratory . nurse to attend. I said, ""can you send another doctor but one who isn't . drunk?"" The call handler refused to process that call and passed me to . her supervisor who told me she would get a doctor to call me back. 'This didn't happen. Later that day - . my mother's breathing deteriorated so I called an ambulance which . arrived about 10 minutes after my call. 'I was told that Harmoni had . called an ambulance in response to my telephone call in the morning, . however, unless the ambulance they called arrived after the one I . called, this is just not true.' Agnes Seecoomar claims her mother Dorothy died after being in the care of a drunk out-of-hours doctor . Ms Seecoomar said she had contacted . Harmoni on September 4, almost a fortnight after her mother's death to . ask if they had an update on their investigation. She said: 'I was told, ""actually we . are just about to send a letter asking for your mother's authorisation . to investigate"". I said, ""well that's difficult because my mother is . dead"".' Ms Seecoomar added: 'The experience with the doctor was frightening. 'People think we still have an NHS - but we don't, we have commissioners and providers. The providers are increasingly private companies whose primary concern is profit. 'It seems to be a competition to see who can provide healthcare at the lowest possible cost. 'This raises huge questions about quality and accountability as illustrated by what happened to my mother. 'The reality is that we a National Health Service in name only.' NHS South West London, the primary care trust which contracted Harmoni to provide out-of-hours care, has launched an inquiry. The General Medical Council, the body which licenses doctors, has also opened an inquiry and the healthcare watchdog the Care Quality Commission is examining the case. A spokesperson for NHS South West London said: 'We are in the process of fully investigating these serious allegations and now have permission from Ms Seecoomar to review her mother’s medical records; we are doing so as a matter of urgency. 'The results of this full and thorough investigation and the subsequent action we take as a result, will be shared with Ms Seecoomar as soon as it is complete. 'We have spoken to Ms Seecoomar and reassured her that we are dealing with these very serious issues about the out-of-hours GP service and a healthcare professional at the highest level within our organisation. 'We would like to express our sincere condolences to Ms Seecoomar and reassure her that we are doing all we can to get this matter resolved as quickly as possible.' A spokesman for Harmoni said: 'As the largest provider of out-of-hours urgent care in the country, we pride ourselves on offering the highest levels of patient care and satisfaction. Any patient concern with our service is treated very seriously and thoroughly investigated. 'The GP involved in this particular patient complaint has undergone an extensive performance review as part of a very thorough investigation into Ms Seecoomar’s complaint. 'We have contacted Ms Seecoomar and did invite her to meet with us so we could share with her the outcome of this review and discuss any further concerns she may have. Ms Seecoomar declined this invitation so we have sent her our findings in writing which include confirmation that the doctor no longer works for Harmoni. 'At a very early stage in our investigation the doctor involved consented to undergo a thorough testing procedure for drug and alcohol misuse. All these tests came back negative and there is no evidence at all to support any suggestion or allegation that this doctor was intoxicated whilst on duty.' (Left) Dr Stuart Gray, whose father David Gray was killed by out-of-hours German doctor Daniel Ubani (right) when he was administered with 10 times the recommended maximum of diamorphine . In one notorious case of an out-of-hours doctor blunder, pensioner David . Gray died after locum Dr Daniel Ubani gave him 10 times the recommended maximum amount of diamorphine to treat pain in his . kidneys. The German doctor had failed an English test for one primary care trust, so had simply applied to work at another. Following his father's tragic death, Dr Stuart Gray, had called for all doctors to undergo checks on their clinical competence. After Dr Ubani was struck off in 2010, the British Medical Association, the General Medical Council (GMC) and former Health Secretary Andrew Lansley all rushed to condemn the loophole in EU law that meant the language skills of doctors trained in Europe could not be tested before they practised in the UK. Records show that coroners' courts and the GMC have since dealt with dozens of cases around the country in which the services have been involved in the deaths of patients, including at least eight in one year.","Agnes Seecoomar claims her mother Dorothy, 81, struggled to breathe because the doctor was drunk and unable to control her oxygen supply .

"By . John Stevens . PUBLISHED: . 19:01 EST, 13 November 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 16:07 EST, 15 November 2012 . Stealing: Global Radio Network boss Stephen Miron has accused the BBC of copying Classic FM's programme format . Their stock in trade is the soothing and the genteel. However, Britain's two classical music radio stations are at the centre of an unseemly row over an 'aggressive' bid by BBC Radio 3 to steal Classic FM's listeners. The popular commercial station claims that its BBC rival, which has overhauled its schedule over the last 18 months, has imitated a string of ideas: from listener phone-ins to request slots. Stephen Miron, the boss of the Global Radio Network, which includes Classic FM, yesterday said that the BBC had been 'overtly' copying it by introducing changes. Appearing at the Radio Conference in Salford, Mr Miron said: 'If you look at the changing programmes Radio 3 has done against Classic, it is pretty overt that it has looked at the successes that Classic has had and adjusted its programming structure.' He added: 'It's now possible to listen to Radio 3 between 6:30am and 4:30pm and hear only one hour that's not presented by a former Classic FM presenter. 'Radio 3 has introduced listener requests on the phone every day - copying the format pioneered by Classic FM in classical music radio in the UK. 'If you look at what they're doing, it's what we've been doing for years. 'The BBC's whole remit is to provide distinct content in all they do, but it is increasingly replicating what is already catered for. And you can see why, because we have a much larger listenership. 'Radio 3 has aggressively pursued Classic FM and it uses its other platforms to cross-promote the station. They are absolutely trying to take our listeners.' BBC Radio 3 has changed its schedule in the past 18 months in an attempt to broaden its appeal, but some listeners have complained that it increasingly sounds like rival network Classic FM. The station has introduced a morning programme called Essential Classics, which has been compared to Classic FM's Hall of Fame that airs at the same time. And its breakfast show has been criticised for relying too much on the audience to call, text or tweet in their views and take part in competitions. Mr Miron said that most of the changes had been inspired by Classic FM. He said: 'Radio 3's breakfast show is now made up short excerpts of classical music - instead of the full works it broadcast previously. That means less choice for the listeners. 'Classic FM launched a weekly classical CD sales chart when it launched in 1992. Radio 3 has copied this, launching its own chart. Copycats: The BBC has come under attack for replicating commercial shows on Radio 3 with listeners claiming programming has been 'dumbed down' Klass act: Myleene Klass has worked for Classic Fm since 2006 . 'Radio 3's cut back on jazz . programmes during the day - replacing them with classical music . programmes and moving jazz mainly to late nights - reducing listener . choice to compete with Classic FM head-on. 'Radio 3 now has more film soundtracks in its daytime programmes - particularly breakfast - copying Classic FM.' Despite the changes, Radio 3's audience has only marginally increased. In figures released last month it had 2.15million listeners, up just over one per cent on the same time last year. At the same time Classic FM had 5.45million listeners. Many Radio 3 . listeners have called for a return to 'pure and simple good music'. Sarah . Spilsbury, from Friends of Radio 3, labelled the changes a case of . cultural vandalism. While listeners said the new programmes were more . 'Radio 2.5' because of their reliance on audience participation. One listener told Radio 4's Feedback: 'I finally switched off Breakfast this morning. Too ghastly for words. A DJ instead of a presenter, snippets of stuff from newspapers filling in the cracks, invitations to tweet, and bitty music, all of which I have heard a million times before.' Others have accused the presenters of behaving like they had drunk too much caffeine. Last year, governing body the BBC Trust told Radio 3 to 'extend its core appeal' but said it must do so without 'jeopardising distinctiveness'. It said there were times when the station could sound 'heavy and inaccessible' and was viewed as 'elitist', before recommending that it should be more welcoming. The station, which is predominantly listened to by those who are over 55, and middle class, was effectively told to find ways of finding younger and more minority audiences. A BBC spokesman said: 'BBC national stations offer a distinctive range of programming with a strong public service focus which marks them out from commercial stations. 'Radio 1, Radio 2 and Radio 3 all organise big events and focus on speech, drama, live music, new music and music that has limited airplay elsewhere. 'We are always sensitive to leaving space for the commercial sector and we are delighted that companies such as Global continue to thrive.'","Global Radio Network accuses BBC of trying to steal Classic FM listeners .

Shares of Facebook Inc jumped nearly 13 per cent on Wednesday, as investors breathed a sigh of relief that expiring trading restrictions on a huge block of shares failed to trigger an immediate wave of insider selling. 'While the lockup is expiring, there is nothing requiring anybody to sell,' said Tim Ghriskey, chief investment officer at Solaris Group in Bedford Hills, New York. He added: 'Given the low price, these long-term holders are deciding to hold the stock, and that is lifting it here as the fear of the expiration subsides.' Signs of life: Facebook shares climbed nearly 13 . per cent even after the largest block of shares held by company . insiders were eligible for sale . Roughly 800 million Facebook shares were eligible for sale on Wednesday after restrictions on insider selling were lifted on the biggest block since Facebook's May initial public offering. The lockup expiration greatly expands the 921-million-share 'float' available for trading on the market until now. 'We've seen this before with other lockups. People sell them leading up to the lockup period expiring, and then they have a bit of a relief rally,' said Ryan Jacob, chief executive of the Jacob Funds, which does not own Facebook shares. In August, shares of the online reviews website Yelp Inc surged by more than 20 per cent on the day that insider trading restrictions expired. Rise and fall: Facebook's value has dropped nearly 50 per cent since the IPO, but now appears to be gaining ground . That stock's rally was boosted as short-sellers scrambled to cover their positions when the expected flood of selling failed to materialize, say analysts. Facebook shares finished on Wednesday's regular trading session up 12.6 per cent at $22.36 on the Nasdaq, with trading volume for the stock more than four times the average during the past 50 days. The world's No. 1 online social network became the only U.S. company to debut with a market value of more than $100 billion. IPO: Mark Zuckerberg stands at front and center after remotely ringing the Nasdaq opening bell on the day of the social networking giant's initial public offering . But its value has dropped nearly 50 per cent since the IPO on concerns about money-making prospects over the long term. Insider trading lockup provisions . started to expire in August, and the rolling expirations have added to . the pressure on the stock. Restrictions on insider selling have expired in waves. A limitation on more than 200 million shares expired on Oct. 29. COST OF SHORTINGPivotal Research Group analyst Brian Wieser said he did not expect Facebook insiders to sell all of their shares as the lockups expired. 'I would expect heavy volumes over the next few weeks, but not undigestible volumes,' said Wieser. By his estimate, roughly 486 million of the nearly 800 million newly freed Facebook shares will be sold. There is some evidence that the heavy interest in 'shorting' the stock was dissipating, given the poor performance since it first sold shares in May. Strategy: Mobile revenue has been a concern since before Facebook's IPO - as more and more people are accessing the site on wireless phones and tablets . Investors who believe a stock will fall can bet against it by shorting the stock, that is, borrowing it and selling it in the hopes it will decline. According to Markit's Data Explorers, about 28 per cent of the shares available for short-selling were being borrowed for that purpose, down from a high of more than 80 per cent in early August. Similarly, SunGard's Astec Analytics, which also tracks interest in shorting, noted that the cost of borrowing Facebook shares is down more than 50 per cent since the beginning of the month. 'Everything would seem to indicate the market is losing its appetite to short Facebook,' wrote Karl Loomes, market analyst at Astec. The cost of shorting Facebook has declined to 0.18 per cent on an annualized basis, Astec said on Wednesday. Holding: Facebook boss Mark Zuckerberg has pledged not to sell any shares of his stock in the company before September 2013 . By contrast, shortly after the IPO, the cost to short the stock ranged from 40 to 50 per cent annually.'It's become somewhat of a controversial stock - it always adds fuel to the fire if you have a sizable short position,' said Stephen Massocca, managing director at Wedbush Morgan in San Francisco. 'But the unlock is not new news. It doesn't mean everyone is going to sell and it doesn't mean every order is going to come in today.' Several members of Facebook's senior management have sold millions of dollars' worth of shares in recent weeks through pre-arranged stock trading plans as lockup restrictions expired. Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg has sold roughly 530,000 shares this month, netting just over $11 million, though she still owns roughly 20 million vested shares in Facebook. In August, Facebook board member Peter Thiel sold roughly $400million worth of Facebook stock, the majority of his stake, when an earlier phase of lockup restrictions expired. Facebook's 28-year-old chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, has pledged not to sell any shares before September 2013. Facebook had a notorious initial public offering in May at $38, mired by technical glitches, and it's been under pressure since because of doubts about its ability to grow revenue at a fast clip. The shares saw their biggest one-day gain on October 24, the day after the company reported stronger-than-expected third-quarter results and detailed for the first time how much money it made from mobile ads. But shares had declined since then. Mobile revenue has been a concern since before Facebook's IPO since more and more people are accessing the site on wireless phones and tablets.","Shares in social networking giant climb nearly 13 per cent on Wednesday trading .

Britain’s Christmas trees are under attack from an aggressively spreading disease that is sweeping through farms and hitting up to 50 per cent of their crops. The condition, called 'current season needle necrosis', is killing the . Nordmann fir and making hundreds of thousands of the UK's most popular Christmas tree completely unsaleable. This disease attacks in the build-up to the festive period, turning its needles yellow and then later brown before they just drop off completely. Devastation: This field of Christmas trees has been hit with the full force of Current Season Needle Necrosis, causing their needles to turn brown and then drop out . On many farms up to £50,000 worth of Nordmann firs from each field are being cut down and slung on the scrap heap. This species is found in 80 per cent of UK homes on December 25.

Victoria and Prince Albert in the 19th century, behind the scenes . growers are losing huge sums and fear for the future. Healthy: Consumers will still get their tree this year but growers are losing huge numbers in their crops . It comes as many as 80million British ash trees are under attack from a different fungal disease that causes black spots, cankers on bark and twigs and branches dying. 'This is a big problem in Europe and the UK,'  Berkshire Christmas tree grower Sadie Lynes told BBC Radio 4. 'Nobody understands totally why this is happening but it is something to do with a fungus. 'It has caused devastation in some crops and there are some that have nothing of them left.' Experts are still baffled by why current season needle necrosis is becoming so virulent, with Britain's record warm and wet summers and also the use of herbicides which may be stripping off protective wax on fir needles being blamed. A fungus Sydowia polyspora could be at its heart, but it is not known what causes it and how it can be prevented. As recently as 2010 it was rare but now it is damaging hundreds of . thousands of trees across Britain, with farms in the south of England worst hit. Colin Palmer, who advises the British Christmas Tree Growers Association on this puzzling condition, said: 'It has never been a big problem and it has always been there but in the last couple of years it has gone from being benign and in one or two trees to aggressive. We are researching what is causing it.'","'Current season needle necrosis' is attacking Nordmann firs, found in 80% of households at Christmas .

Knockout: John Applewhite, 34, was punched in Long Island by a man in a random attack, breaking his jaw . A Long Island resident has been arrested for attacking a volunteer utility worker from Florida who had travelled to New York to help restore power after Hurricane Sandy left the region largely without power. Thomas Libretto, 34, was arrested outside of his Long Island home four days after allegedly beating up John Applewhite, also 34, but he insisted that he is actually the victim. Libretto and his girlfriend went to dinner at Texas Roadhouse in East Meadow, Long Island on Friday because they were happy to have their power restored. The New York Post reports that because the restaurant was too full to accommodate them, they got back to their car in the parking lot and were driving out when   they saw Applewhite allegedly urinating in public. 'I mean he had is penis out- right in front of me and my girlfriend. In a joking way I said ""Oh pal do you have to do that there?"" Libretto told the paper. Applewhite had travelled to East Hempstead, Long Island from his home in Lakeland, Florida with 24 other electrical workers, and had just finished a 16-hour shift when he said that the man started yelling at him. Applewhite said that the suspect got out of his black BMW, walked toward him, and punched him once in the face, breaking his jaw and fracturing several other bones in his face. Scroll down for video . Return home: Applewhite was flown back to his home in Florida, where he will have his jaw wired shut and receive plastic surgery to repair his facial fractures . Libretto contradicts that version, saying that the utility worker kicked his car and so he got out to check the damage. His girlfriend Victoria Fasullo . defends his story, saying that Libretto had no choice but to get out of . the car and check what happened so that he could properly make an . insurance claim afterwards. 'This ""victim"" walked up to our car, . knowing the odds were stacked in his favor, knowing his buddies would . come out of nowhere to back him up,' Ms Fasullo told The Post. Her vision came true when- Libretto says- eight to 10 of Applewhite's friends joined the altercation and pounced on Libretto. 'They kicked the s**t out of me. I’m not some animal. I would never punch anyone for no reason,' Libretto said. According to the Nassau County Police .

Thinking the man had a question about . power restoration, Mr Applewhite headed in the direction of the man, . while Mr Barefoot stayed by the service vehicle. ‘Just as I got within arm’s reach, he decked me,’ Mr Applewhite told WTSP. The single punch broke his jaw, his cheekbone, and other facial bones. He also suffered a black eye. When Mr Barefoot tried to intervene, the suspect allegedly bit him on the finger and then ran back to his BMW, driving away. Mr Applewhite was rushed to Nassau Medical Center, but he was eventually flown back to Tampa. The lineman said that his jaw has to be wired shut, and he faces reconstructive surgery to repair the broken bones in his face.

A judge said he was powerless to hand a jail term to female Tube passenger who hurled 'fascist' insults at commuters and instead had to give her a £210 fine. Rebecca Afeigan, 29, was told she deserves to be sent to prison after she forced the suspension of the Piccadilly line as she hurled abuse at fellow passengers. She kicked and spat at a Polish man because she could not understand his accent and told a black man to 'go home to Africa'. Her vile outburst continued until Tube staff were forced to evacuate the train while police were called to the scene. Tube passenger hurled 'fascist' abuse at passengers on a Piccadilly line train forcing Tube staff to evacuate the train . District Judge Michael Snow told her: 'On a packed commuter train, you racially abused someone because of the colour of their skin. You racially abused a second person because, with his accent, it was not immediately obvious he was speaking English. 'You used a classic fascist reply of: ""You are here taking our jobs and taking our money"". 'How rich to hear something like that from someone like you. ‘This is a society based on tolerance, and that’s what is its strength. You have made no contribution to society, you regularly take from it, are still abusing drugs and assaulting our citizens. ‘When someone behaves like you, it trashes the image we have held out to the world'. The Judge went on to brand Afeigan a national embarrassmemt and lamented the fact he could not send her to prison. He said she had an ‘appalling’ criminal record of 18 convictions but told her the maximum penalty available for her latest misdeed is a fine. Afeigan, a cocaine and alcohol addict, launched her torrent of abuse after accusing the black man of pushing her on a Piccadilly Line train between Manor House and Turnpike Lane. Prosecutor Darren Watts told the Westminster Magistrates' Court: 'A Polish man spoke out and told the defendant her behaviour was not acceptable. The defendant then racially abused this man, saying he was taking jobs and was a drain on the system. 'When the train pulled into Turnpike Lane station, Afeigan, who is also black, told the Polish man to ""get off the train"", but when he refused she began kicking him and spitting at him. She was also heard to say ""I will stab you in the face” Staff had to clear the whole train of passengers as the defendant refused to get off.' Afeigan was eventually arrested by officers waiting for the train at Arnos Grove station. Afeigan's record includes four theft convictions between 1999 and 2004, seven sentences for possession of drugs, two assaults in 2008, and assault occasioning actual bodily harm in 2010. Earlier this year Afeigan was locked up for 23 weeks for assault and is currently subject to a 12 week sentence suspended for 12 months for possession of an offensive weapon. The suspended sentence was not activated today because she committed the Tube abuse before being sentenced for possessing the weapon. Afeigan, who also has a 1999 conviction for cruelty to an animal, has disobeyed court orders three times and turned up 30 minutes late for court this afternoon. When she tried to apologise for her actions, Judge Snow said: ‘Talk is cheap. You are violent and a racist, in my opinion, and ought to be going to prison'. The Judge fined her £210, ordered to pay £85 costs and a £15 victim surcharge after pleading guilty to racially aggravated harassment. She will pay £10 every two weeks until the fine is cleared, and faces jail if she fails to pay up in time .","Rebecca Afeigan racially abused and threatened fellow Tube passengers .

Tory MP Chris Heaton-Harris apologised after being caught on film apparently admitting he encouraged his friend James Delingpole to stand against the Conservative candidate in Corby . The Conservative campaign manager in the by-election to replace Louise Mensch as MP for Corby has been caught on film admitting he encouraged a rival candidate. Chris Heaton-Harris today apologised after footage emerged in which he suggested his friend James Delingpole had put his name forward to stand against the Tory party candidate. Mr Heaton-Harris, MP for Daventry, was filmed saying it was 'part of the plan' to 'cause some hassle' in the Corby by-election by making wind farms a major issue ahead of polling day. Ms Mensch stood down in the summer, claiming she could not juggle family life and the demands of being an MP. The Tory party candidate is Christine Emmett, and Mr Heaton-Harris was put in charge of the campaign to get her elected in the vote, which is being held tomorrow. But he was filmed discussing how he persuaded Mr Delingpole, a newspaper columnist, to also throw his hat into the ring. Speaking to a Greenpeace activist posing as a wind power opponent last month, Mr Heaton-Harris said: 'There's a bit of strategy behind what's going on. I'm running the Corby by-election for the Tories ... And Delingpole, who is my constituent, and a very good friend... put his head above the parapet but won't put his deposit down... It's just part of the plan.' In another exchange published by The Guardian, he appeared to admit to persuading Mr Delingpole to consider standing. 'Please don't tell anybody ever. But he will not be putting his deposit down. He just did it because it's a long campaign, it's six weeks to cause some hassle and get, and get people talking.' Louise Mensch triggered tomorrow's Corby by-election when she quit as the MP to move her family to the US . Mr Delingpole withdrew from the race two weeks ago the day after Conservative energy minister John Hayes controversially told the Daily Mail the development of onshore wind farms would be reined in. Mr Heaton-Harris today issued a statement apologising for his behaviour: 'The quotes attributed to me range from factually correct statements to me bragging about things beyond my control, which has so often before been the failing of politicians. Author and columnist James Delingpole withdrew from the race after energy minister John Hayes signaled a retreat on wind farms . 'The implication that I choreographed any sort of 'secret plan' is simply not the case and I apologise if that is the impression given. 'It can hardly be said that my wanting to ""put this on the agenda"" is new. I have spent years fighting on-shore wind, getting over 100 MPs to sign a letter to the Prime Minister, securing debates and raising questions in Parliament and touring the country speaking to anti-wind groups. 'It is a subject I am passionate about and will continue to work on until communities across my constituency, Northamptonshire and the country have the protection they deserve.' The revelation sheds further light on Tory party splits on wind power. Last night Mr Hayes repeated his opposition to onshore turbines, telling Channel 4 News that Britain has planned enough windfarms and it is 'end of story' for the technology. Labour frontbencher Michael Dugher said: 'This is yet more evidence of the Conservative Party in chaos. 'It is astonishing that a Conservative MP appears to have encouraged a rival candidate to run in a by-election in order to campaign against windfarms. David Cameron needs to get a grip on his divided and out of touch party.'","Footage shows Chris Heaton-Harris saying he persuaded anti-wind farm columnist James Delingpole to stand in Corby by-election .

The irony of the former CIA director getting caught in a sex scandal even though he was presumably the country's top spymaster is obvious. But that doesn't mean that David Petraeus and his biographer-turned-mistress Paula Broadwell didn't use some handy espionage tradecrafts to keep their liaisons a secret for nearly a year. Petraeus and Broadwell would communicate using a dummy Gmail account that they set up as a modern version of the classic spy 'dead drop' trick, where they would leave their messages in the account's draft folder to save it for the other to see. Affair: David Petraeus is pictured with Paula Broadwell, his biographer and alleged mistress . Insult: A photograph in June 2011 shows . Broadwell watching as Petraeus and his wife Holly arrive for a Senate . Select Intelligence Committee hearing on Petraeus' nomination to be . director of the CIA . Rather than sending each other actual . emails, which would create an electronic paper trail, they would write . messages and save them as drafts. The other would then log in to the same account, view the message, delete it and then leave a response that would also be saved rather than sent. Dead drops, wherein spies leave messages for their sources or informants at a neutral location and then the individual would go and pick up the message before returning with their own response. In the digital era, however, Gmail's draft folder creates an easy space for teenagers, terrorists, and apparently philandering politicians to do the same. Deception: Paula Broadwell is married to a . radiologist, Scott Broadwell (left), and they have two young sons . together, while Petraeus has been married to Holly for 38 years. They . have two grown children . Petraeus was the one to set up the fake account in this case, and he used a pseudonym to do so. The pair may never have been caught if Broadwell didn't go against the papertrail the save-but-don't-send trick safeguarded the lovers from. The scandal came under investigation only after Broadwell used one of her email accounts to send anonymous emails to Florida housewife Jill Kelley. From right: Holly Petraeus, Jill Kelley and her husband Scott, Gen David Petraeus and Jill Kelley's sister Natalie Khawam far left . The 37-year-old Kelley knows a number of high-profile military men because she is an honorary social liaison for MacDill Air Force base in Tampa, Florida. Kelley contacted a friend of hers who is an FBI agent because she felt threatened and feared for her safety after receiving a half-dozen anonymous emails. A government official told the New York Post that the emails contained such language as: 'I know what you did,' 'back off' and 'stay away from my guy.' The official added: '(Broadwell) clearly thought something was going on' and thought she was in a 'lovers triangle.' A person who knows both Mrs Kelley and Petraeus confirmed their friendship and said she saw him often. 'Very sexy': Kelley has been accused of sending 'flirtatious' messages to another general, John Allen . Enjoying herself? Kelley laughs while checking her phone in her Tampa home on Tuesday . All three of those involved- Kelley, Petraeus and Broadwell- were all married to other people and they all have multiple children. The Kelleys- Jill and her surgeon husband Scott- have been close family friends with David and Holly Petraeus for around five years and the two couples have been frequently photographed together at parties. Government sources have said that Kelley exchanged emails and IMs with General Petraeus daily but those were on his official account and were monitored by staff members, and are not considered inappropriate. Now another four-star General has been roped into the allegations, as the Pentagon has since started its own investigation into 20,000 to 30,000 pages of communications between John Allen, the commander of U.S. and Nato forces in Afghanistan, and Kelley. Scandal: Gen. John Allen, pictured before the Senate Armed Services Committee in March as his wife and daughter look on, is under investigation for sending 'inappropriate emails' to a military party planner . Allen and Mrs Kelley met in the same manner that she became close with Petraeus, as Allen served on the same Florida base from 2008 to 2011. The same innocent nature of the communications between Kelley and Petraeus cannot be said about her emails with Allen, as investigators flagged a number of them for being ‘flirtatious’. They have not specified whether it was done by Kelley, Allen or both. The Washington Post gave the example of Allen's use of the word 'sweetheart' in referring to married mom Kelley, but a senior Pentagon official said that proves nothing as the 58-year-old general is from Virginia and the word is used in the south as a platonic phrase and not one demonstrating a romantic relationship.","Petraeus set up a Gmail account under a pseudonym .

Cardboard boxes left inches away from a wood-burning stove  are being blamed as the cause of the Orrington, Maine fire that left three children and their father dead on in the early hours of Saturday morning. The fact that the family was only using the stove temporarily as they waited for loan approval to finance their purchase of a new furnace adds to the outrage over the situation. The only survivor of the fire was the children’s mother, Christine Johnson, who escaped while her husband Benjamin, their nine-year-old son Ben, eight-year-old daughter Leslie, and 4-year-old son Ryan were all trapped inside. Tragic: Christine Johnson, 31, survived by climbing out a window but she realized that her husband and three children, including Leslie, 4, 'went the wrong way' The Bangor Daily News reports that . when the fire department arrived on the scene, they tried to enter . through a window but ruled the blaze too dangerous and were forced to . pull back. Bucksport fire . chief Craig Bowden said that they four victims were likely already dead . when the responders got to the scene around 2.30am. The fire took two . hours to fully extinguish. Neighbors Terri and Doug Winslow called the police when they heard Christine screaming and they called the fire department. 'We . jumped out of bed and (we) saw the orange fire on the front of the . house. I called 911 while my husband jumped into some clothes and . grabbed some coats. While I was on the phone with emergency I opened the . window and hollered out to her that I heard her and she kept hollering . to please help,' neighbor Terri Winslow told the Bangor Daily News. '(Christine) said that her husband and kids were in the house which I relayed to 911. 'When . I opened the window I heard her and her husband talking ... and she . just kept saying ""they went the wrong way, they went the wrong way!"" 'She was sitting on the breezeway in between the house and the garage. Horror: A fire at this rural wood home early on Saturday killed a father and his three children, while the childrens' mother escaped and was taken to a hospital to be treated for smoke inhalation . 'My husband threw a bird bath through a window and hollered in to see if anybody responded. 'I knew that from the previous owners there was a door there and I knew that if I opened the door I would be confronted by a wall of flames and I was afraid that I wouldn't be able to get out, so I didn't go in,' Mrs Winslow said. 'When . I opened the window I heard her and her husband talking ... and (Christine) just kept saying ""they went the wrong way, they went the wrong way!""' -Neighbor Terri Winslow, who called the police the night of the fire . The bodies of the three children were found in a bedroom on the second floor while the father’s body was found at the top of the stairs nearby. Christine was on the roof of the home when emergency workers arrived. This fire- which is the deadliest fire in Maine in the past 20 years- is not the family’s first tragedy, as The Portland Press Herald reports that one of the couple’s son Thomas died of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome in 2007. Christine Johnson is still being treated for smoke inhalation at Eastern Maine Medical Center in Bangor and is fielding visits from friends as she begins to plan the funerals for her husband and children. ‘Ben was her soul, the kids were her soul, so I just don’t know how well she’s going to recover,’ her friend Tabitha Robertson told the paper. ‘It’s just been one thing after another for her.’ Deadly: Firefighting crews from Bangor and four other towns were called in after the fire was reported at around 2:30 a.m., and it took an hour to extinguish the blaze . Remainders: The husband was found at the top of the stairs on the second floor and the three children were found together in a second floor bedroom . The children attended Center Drive School where Principal Roy Allen described them as 'great kids, very nice kids.' 'This is just such a tragedy. It's going to be devastating for the kids because it's such a small school and everybody knows everybody,' Allen told the Bangor Daily News. The Johnsons had just moved into the house in the rural town of Orrington six months ago. They were in the process of buying the house through a short sale, meaning that it would take months for the loan agreement would be finalized by the lender, JP Morgan Chase, in the coming months. Once the sale was approved, they were planning on replacing the 46-year-old hot water furnace, which explains their use of the wood stove with a propane heater. The Johnsons arrived home late Friday night after an evening of family bowling and lit the stove in the first floor living room. Investigators found empty cardboard boxes- which were likely used as kindling to start the fire in the first place- just inches away from the stove. A container of lighter fluid was nearby as well, which added to the pace at which the fire spread. Damage: The fire ravaged the house and caused part of the roof to collapse . Tragic end of a nice night: The family lit the fire to keep the house warm after returning home from a night at the local bowling lanes . Police are still investigating the fire, but their initial reports suggest that they did not have smoke alarms installed in the home. One of the last people to see the husband and children alive was the owner of their local bowling center, appropriately titled Family Fun, who was in shock at the news of the fire. ‘The entire bowling center is in shock. It feels like he’s been here forever,’ owner Andy Meucci said of Benjamin Johnson. Her work: Christine Johnson works from home and self published this novel over the summer . ‘We were surprised he was only 30 because it seems like he’s been here so long. He started up with the Saturday morning youth league and did that for five or six years and has been in adult leagues ever since,’ Meucci told the Bangor Daily News. ‘You get a ring every time you shoot a 300 and [Johnson] gave one to each of his kids. ‘He’s a little bigger than life in the bowling scene. He also used to bowl Tuesday nights, but that got too expensive with having kids. He and Christine still bowled together in the Dunnett’s Friday Night Mixed Couples League, though.’ Benjamin worked at Hollywood Casino in Bangor and Christine is a self-published author who released her first book ‘The Quest For The Enchanted Stone’ earlier this summer. In her brief author bio, she describes herself as living happily in a small town in Maine with her husband of 10 years. She also says that she is the mother of four, clearly including her son Thomas who died in 2007. ‘I enjoy drawing, and have enough books in my house to start my own bookstore. I enjoy horseback riding, singing, and as strange as this sounds, yard work. I’ve travelled all over as an ex-military brat,’ she wrote. Center Drive School remained open during the Veteran’s Day holiday Monday in order for the victim’s classmates to meet with grief counsellors that were available. One of those students was Hatty May Hubler, whose mother Jennifer brought the third grader to meet with a counsellor because she was friends with Leslie. ‘It’s hard trying to come to terms with it. It comes in waves but the school is doing a good job for the students,’ Ms Hubler said.","Benjamin Johnson III and three children- ages 4, 8, and 9- died in blaze .

A smash and grab jewel thief is starting a five year stretch behind bars today thanks to a group of have-a-go heroes who sat on him until police arrived. Brave onlookers were photographed rugby tackling Jimmy Stringer, 23, and making a citizen's arrest after he smashed his way through the window of a jeweller's shop with a sledge hammer and stolen £100,000 worth of watches. Stringer had managed to leave the store on foot despite an anti-theft device billowing smoke from the shop in a bid to disorientate the thief and an unidentified accomplice. But Oxford Crown Court was told today that passer by Ali Shehan bundled Stringer to the ground before he could flee the scene. Onlookers then piled on top of the thief and he was held down until police arrived. Two other gang members on scooters were also part of the targeted rain in Banbury, Oxfordshire. CCTV . cameras caught several other members of the public throwing advertising . boards at the riders and a pensioner attempted to hit the pillion rider . on the scooter with her walking stick but narrowly missed. Despite four arrests being made by . police only one robbery charge against Stringer was ever brought - and . he pleaded guilty at the earliest opportunity at a previous hearing. Prosecutor Jonathan Stone told a hearing at Oxford Crown Court: 'He was rugby tackled to the floor by Mr Shehan. 'During this process his crash helmet fell off. The defendant said: ""You’re a dead man. You’re a dead man."" Other shoppers ran to the aid of the brave man and piled in to stop Stringer wriggling free, the judge was told. The . dramatic intervention happened yards away from the targeted Robert . Jones jewellers in High Street, Banbury at about 11am on September 11. 'It was a well planned operation,' added Mr Stone. Scroll down to see the footage . Restrained thief: Brave shoppers tackled and restrained Jimmy Stringer, 23, as he tried to escape with £100,000 worth of designer watches . Arrested: The shoppers held Stringer until police arrived to take him away . 'Stop him': One witness said he heard people shouting 'stop him, stop him' after he was part of the gang who carried out a raid on the jewellery store beforehand . 'It just fell flat at the end as they . hadn’t planned their escape. The watches - worth £100,000 pounds - were . seized by a member of the public and taken back to the jewellery store. 'There . was £30,000 pounds of damage caused. Windows were smashed and watches . were damaged and needed to be repaired,' the prosecuter added. Mr Stone said the defendant told police he met the trio on holiday in Tenerife and they told him about the store. He knew they were local to the area, but didn’t know their identities. William . Woodman, defending, said: 'The weapon was used as a tool, rather than . in a threatening way. He did not use it as a weapon on anyone. No words . were used.' Admitted robbery: Stringer was part of a gang that robbed Michael Jones' Jewellers, who wielded hammers and smashed jewellery cases . In custody: Stringer was jailed for five years - he will spend half the term in jail and the rest on licence . He added: 'The loss of employment led to him spiralling into the receipt of benefits. He had also built up a drug debt.' Addressing the light-haired defendant, Judge Patrick Eccles said: 'This was a targeted smash and grab raid.'It was down to the people who stepped in who stopped you getting away with what you had taken.'

"By . Quentin Letts . PUBLISHED: . 21:15 EST, 13 November 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 05:54 EST, 14 November 2012 . Community spirit: Miriam Margolyes, Quentin Letts (right) and Bill Kenwright hunt for the nation's best amateur dramatic company . Essex bricklayer Steve Foster pauses with a lump of wet mortar on his trowel. After changing into character, the nasal-voiced, side-whiskered Mr Foster, 63, starts spouting Shakespeare. 'Mistress Ford,' he cries. 'I would thy husband were dead: I'll speak it before the best lord. I would make thee my Layydee!' And with that he throws back his head and gives a filthy, Sid-James-style laugh before returning to his wall. Brickie Foster is one of Britain's large, neglected tribes: the amateur dramaticals. There are thousands of them up and down the land. Some act well, some appallingly. Some sew costumes, some paint backdrops, some do the make-up and some boss everyone around while directing the shows. Britain's am-dram scene is lively, growing - but is often sneered at by the wider world. Am-drams? Oh, you say, that's ham actors standing with their feet at a 'quarter-to-three' angle in front of wonky props. That's prompters in the wings shouting lines at half-deaf thespians. How wrong you are. Having just taken part - as the Mail's theatre critic - in a TV talent show about am-drams, I can tell you they're on a roll. Or rather, a role. Steve Foster belongs to the Heath Players from Hatfield Heath on the Essex-Herts border. He is about to play Sir John Falstaff in an Essex take of The Merry Wives of Windsor (the wives are done up like ageing Spice Girls). Fellow stalwarts in the troupe, which was founded in 1967, include a marine surveyor, a Vauxhall car dealer, a teacher and a civil servant. That, anyway, is what they do by day. By night they become a host of characters. As the saying went on Matthew Kelly's Stars In Their Eyes: 'Tonight, Matthew, I am going to be . . .' The same happens in Glasgow, where salesman Barry Ward is pumping himself up into a frenzy of sexual anger - in order (let it hurriedly be said) to play Hamlet. Thirty-something Barry belongs to the Strathclyde Theatre Group, where his fellow actors include a dustman and a carer for the elderly. Am-drams were last week pooh-poohed by London opera critic Rupert Christiansen, who wrote of 'self-managing, largely middle-class adult groups performing extant plays or musicals in the village hall or community theatre'. Pausing only to ask 'er, what's wrong with middle-class?', one has to conclude that the normally fair-minded Mr Christiansen is speaking out of his exhaust pipe. When I signed up as a judge on Sky's Nation's Best Am Dram (along with impresario Bill Kenwright and actress Miriam Margolyes) I did not know what to expect. Sky had invited the am-dram societies of Britain to submit audition tapes. The winner would get the chance to stage a production in London's West End - which, to am-drammers, is like getting to play a match at Wembley. Entries were whittled down to a long list of 20. Some of the productions were, admittedly, as wooden as the Mayflower. Some actors wore Ozzy Osbourne-style eye make-up to play Greek tragedy. Murdered by mascara! Some waved their hands in the air - woooo - like Pan's People. But some of the auditions were top rate. For instance, West Yorkshire's Bingley Little Theatre had done a version of the witches scene in Shakespeare's Macbeth. This is a minefield even for professional actors. There is always a danger, with all those toad and newt giblets, that the audience will start splurffing with laughter instead of feeling spooked. Bingley's amateurs set the scene in a gay bar, casting the witches as three camp old men. Those taking part included NHS worker Jonathan Scott, 51, with an Ena Sharples-style hairnet on his head, who hissed and bitched to a high order. The Royal Shakespeare Company would have been proud to call his interpretation their own. The same was true when Crossmichael Drama Club, from Galloway, gave us their take on the 'mechanicals' scene from A Midsummer Night's Dream. Nation's Best Am Dram reflects the country's lively community theatre scene . Amateur Dramatics brings together talent from all walks of life, from brickies to single mothers . They did it in a strong Scots dialect which, far from making the scene incomprehensible, made it soar in the most unexpected way. Nick Bottom and his mates can come across as clumping idiots with accents like Benny from Crossroads. Here they were sparky rustics, eyes  a-gleam (with excitement and  terror) at the thought of doing some acting. Crossmichael's members include a sheep farmer, a schoolmaster and a mother who is full-time carer for her disabled child. These are time-starved people, yet they carve a few precious hours out of every week to devote themselves to the arts. More than 2,500 am-dram groups belong to the National Operatic and Dramatic Association. These are run by volunteers who come in after a day's work, grab a bite to eat, then dash off to rehearsals with a disparate band of neighbours. Every few weeks, along comes show-night - the roar of the greasepaint, the smell of the crowd. And then the all-important cast party, where thirsts are quenched and romances may be forged. 'It's a cracking way to meet women,' laughs Steve Foster. 'Not at my age, though - that's long gone!' Lusty Sir John Falstaff might not agree. Hair-salon receptionist Tracey Challen, who acts with Dorset's Regent Rep, says am-drams are 'a massive part of who I am. Acting for me is the same as eating, breathing, sleeping.' Sound engineer Bruce Downie, 44, from Glasgow, says directing the Strathclyde Theatre Group is the biggest thing in his life. Sitting in the group's theatre, he says simply: 'This is my real home.' Having long watched the likes of The X Factor and Britain's Got Talent, I'd suspected talent shows whipped up participants into false states of emotion. From my judge's seat on Nation's Best Am Dram, I saw genuine tears and cheers. Winners of Nation's Best Am Dram will get the chance to stage a production on London's West End . When the 20-year-olds from  Liverpool's Tell Tale community theatre company were told they had made it to the next round, they reacted like Premier League footballers after scoring a goal - though they did not rip off their shirts which, given the curvaceousness of some of the group's actresses, was just as well. Why do people devote so much time to am-drams? Various reasons. For Anne McIntyre, 44, director of Crossmichael, it is 'a release'. She has a disabled son at home. 'Drama gives me something else to focus on,' she says. For mother-of-seven Janet Blizzard, from the Wirral, am-dram is a return to a life she had once hoped to follow before babies intervened. 'I'd like to think perhaps I could have made it as an actress,' says Mrs Blizzard, 55. So is it all a middle-class self-indulgence? Tommyrot. Am-drams embody the best of British community spirit. And I say that without the slightest need for a prompt.","New TV show Nation's Best Am Dram is the X-Factor for thespians .

A woman accused in the deaths of four children in a fire at her home day care in Houston was found guilty today on one count of felony murder. Jessica Tata, 24, who was emotionless when the verdict was read out, faces up to life in prison for the February 2011 death of 16-month-old Elias Castillo. Authorities say Tata left Elias and six other children unsupervised while she went to a nearby Target store. Yesterday: Next to her attorney Mike DeGeurin, home day care operator Jessica Tata listens to the closing arguments in her murder trial for the death of 16-month-old Elias Castillo . Emotions: Rosie Castillo, center, grandmother of 16-month-old day care fire victim, Elias Castillo, reacts after walking out of the closing arguments yesterday . The fire started when oil ignited in a pan on top of a stovetop burner. Three other children were seriously injured in the fire. Tata still faces three more counts of . felony murder, three counts of abandoning a child and two counts of . reckless injury to a child. The jury are still to hear evidence in the punishment phase of her trial. Prosecutors did not say after the verdict was read whether they planned to seek a life sentence. Some of Elias' family and relatives of other victims present in the courtroom slumped over and began to cry. 'We're thankful for today's verdict,' said Nancy Villanueva, one of Elias's aunts. 'We're happy.' Defense attorney Mike DeGeurin said he accepted the jury's verdict and would now focus on sentencing. 'She's never lost sight of the real victims,' DeGeurin said. 'She hasn't forgotten that. It's not all about her.' Fate: Jessica stands as she is convicted of the murder of a toddler who was under her care when a fire started at her home . Reactions: Members of the children's families slumped in their seats in the courtroom gallery, softly sobbing as the verdict was read out . Tata's attorneys argued that she never intended to hurt the children, who ranged in age from 16 months to three years, and that she tried to save them. But prosecutors did not need to show she intended to harm the children, only that the deaths occurred because she put them in danger by leaving them alone. Under Texas law, a person can be convicted of felony murder if he or she committed an underlying felony and that action led to the death. Tata fled to Nigeria in the wake of the fire but was captured a month later and returned to the U.S. where she has remained jailed since. She was born in the U.S. but has Nigerian citizenship. During Tata's trial, which began October 24, surveillance video was presented that showed her shopping at Target just before the fire occurred. A former Target manager told jurors that Tata did not seem to be in a hurry after realizing she had left the stove on while the kids were at the day care. Neighbors testified that they heard the children crying during their unsuccessful attempts to rescue them from the blaze. Parents told jurors they had trusted Tata, believing she was qualified. Died: Four children died during the Texas blaze in February - clockwise from top, Shomari Dickerson, Kendyll Stradford, Elias Castillo and Elizabeth Kajoh . Scene of the deaths: Fire crews can be seen dealing with the aftermath of the deadly blaze, believed to have been caused by oil in a frying pan . Defense attorneys presented expert testimony to argue that faulty kitchen equipment may have sparked the fire. Jurors . could also have found Tata guilty of four lesser counts. There was . brief confusion in court on Tuesday when the jury indicated it had . reached a verdict. But State District Judge Marc Brown sent them back because they had chosen multiple counts instead of one. Prosecutors played back surveillance . video that they say shows Tata shopping alone at the Walmart on the morning . of the fatal blaze in February 2011. She also stopped at a Starbucks. They . also allege that she also went shopping earlier that morning, leaving . behind the children who ranged in age from 16 months to three years old. The video later shows her van leaving the store's parking lot, though it isn't clear if the children are in the vehicle. Tata's attorneys also showed a video, one she took the day of the fire that shows her loading the children into the van. However, defense attorney Mike DeGeurin did not say what time the video was taken or if it was before Tata had gone to Walmart. Jessica Tata, accused in the deaths of four children at her west Houston daycare, pictured during the opening statements at the Harris County Criminal Courthouse . In the video, Tata could be heard telling the children, 'OK guys, get up. It's time to go.' Three-year-old Shomari Dickerson, who died in the fire, could be seen running outside of the home to the van. Tata's attorneys argue that she never intended to hurt the children and that she tried to save them from the fire, which injured three other children. Brian Smith, who worked at the Walmart, testified that the surveillance video and a receipt he reviewed showed Tata was at the store around 7:50am on the day of the fire. In the video, Tata can be seen walking down an aisle alone. On trial: Former day care operator Jessica Tata, pictured during her arraignment . Prior testimony indicated that most of the children in Tata's care that day had been dropped off by 7:15am. 'Does she appear to be in a hurry?' prosecutor Steve Baldassano asked, referring to the video. 'No,' Smith responded. Smith later acknowledged that he couldn't tell if any children were in the van as it left the Walmart parking lot. Prosecutors also played surveillance video showing Tata shopping at Target just before the fire, which investigators say was sparked by oil in a frying pan on a stovetop burner. Tata can be seen arriving at the store at 1:06pm, paying for her items and then lingering in a Starbucks in the store before leaving at 1:22pm.","Prosecutors say Jessica Tata left four children - aged between 18 months and three years - while she went shopping .

Tragic: Firefighter Dawn Brown has been found dead after her pet mastiff fatally bit her neck . A husband has returned home to find his firefighter wife killed by a dog they adopted from a family member just a week ago, police said. Dawn Brown's husband discovered her body in their home in Big Rock, Illinois at 4.15pm on Monday, after she had suffered bites to the neck, Kane County Sheriff’s police Lt. Pat Gengler said. Investigators determined the fatal wounds had been inflicted hours earlier that morning by a mastiff inside the home shared by the couple, who also have a boxer and a pit bull mix. Dawn, 44, and her husband Bob had taken in the mastiff just a week ago from a family member who did not want it anymore, Gengler told MailOnline. 'It was an extremely muscular-looking dog with a large head,' Gengler said. 'It looked big, strong.' He added that police continue to investigate what prompted the attack and whether the animal had previously shown any violent behaviour. He maintained that the previous owners had not given the dog to the Browns because it had been aggressive, simply that they could not look after it anymore. All three dogs were in the custody of Kane County animal control, he said. As of Wednesday evening, no decision had been made about whether or not to keep the mastiff alive, but Gengler added that it would likely be the victim's husband's decision. The couple, who are childless, regarded their two older dogs as their children, Gengler said. Brown's husband is also a volunteer firefighter with the Big Rock Fire Protection District and had attempted to resuscitate his wife on finding her body. He called 911 and the Big Rock fire department responded to the call. Killer: She was bitten by a mastiff they had been given by family members just a week ago (file picture) 'Her friends and co-workers were the . ones that were there,' Gengler said. 'It's a pretty emotionally . devastating thing for them to go through.' Big Rock Fire . Cpt. Debra Raymond said to the Chicago Tribune: 'To pronounce one of your own dead is . probably one of the hardest things we have to do. 'We live in a small town, so we know everyone. But when it's a member of your own team... we're like extended . family.' Of Brown and her husband, she added to the Sun Times: 'They were very much in love. Bob is devastated, and our thoughts are with him right now.' The couple began training with the Big Rock Fire Protection District in 2003. She had also worked full time with the Bristol Kendall Fire Protection District in Yorkville since 2007. Both Raymond and Bristol Kendall's Chief .

A Harvard Business School student who drowned after celebrating his upcoming graduation was drunk when he fell into the water, it emerged today. Nathan Bihlmaier, 31, of Cambridge, Massachusetts, was pulled out of Portland Harbour by divers two days after disappearing in the early hours of May 20. An autopsy has found that he had a blood alcohol level of 0.22 per cent, nearly three times the legal drink-drive limit of 0.08 per cent. Drowned: Nathan Bihlmaier (pictured with his wife Nancy) fell into Portland Harbour in May after celebrating his graduation . Last seen: Mr Bihlmaier visited the Old Port area before he vanished. Divers found a body in the harbour two days later . That level of intoxication generally causes impairments in motor skills, balance and judgment. The blood tests found no drugs in his system, except caffeine. The autopsy, seen by the Portland . Press Herald, found no major injuries apart from minor cuts and bruises, . possibly caused by his fall into the water. The state Medical Examiner's Office . received two sets of test results in June and sought more tests in . September, although it is not clear why. The Medical Examiner's Office had not returned calls from the Press Herald on Tuesday or Wednesday. Desperate search: A missing poster of Nathan Bihlmaier, 31, of Cambridge, Massachusetts, put up in Portland, Maine, after his disappearance . No charges will be brought as a result . of the tragedy after the state medical examiner ruled that . his death was accidental. There is also no record in Portland District Court of any lawsuit linked to Mr Bihlmaier's death. Police said Mr Bihlmaier was . separated from friends after being asked to leave the Ri Ra Irish Pub in . Commercial Street at 12.20am on May 20 because he was intoxicated. He later failed to return to his hotel. He had been due to graduate three days later and he and his wife had just learned that she was pregnant. Police said Mr Bihlmaier and his two friends traveled to Portland for the weekend to celebrate their graduation from business school. Concerned: Mr Bihlmaier's pregnant wife, Nancy Hi Bihlmaier, pictured with her husband at right, rushed to the coastal city after receiving the news of his death . Police confirmed that he had 'a little bit too much to drink' when he was asked to leave, but added that he did not cause a disturbance while leaving the bar. 'At that point he left the bar very co-operatively,' police chief Michael Sauschuck said at the time. 'There were no altercations - he just left voluntarily after being spoken to by bar staff.' He spoke to his friends on the phone, but never returned to the hotel where they were staying. They searched for him to no avail and reported him missing at 9am. 'He is a well-established individual from a strong family. There is no reason he would [purposely] go missing,' Lt Gary Hutcheson told the Press Herald at the time. Family: Mr Bihlmaier, originally from Kansas, with his wife Nancy and his parents Cheryl and Steve . According to his cell phone records, Mr Bihlmaier did not venture far. Police tracked his movements through his phone signal after he left the bar until his battery apparently died 40 minutes later. The Coast Guard and the Portland harbormaster worked together with police to launch the underwater hunt for clues. They even used a cadaver dog on an inflatable raft to search for the man's scent. His wife, Nancy Hi Bihlmaier, rushed to the coastal city after receiving the news that her husband was missing, as did around 20 of his business school friends. Mystery: Police tracked him after he left Ri Ra, pictured, until his phone battery died 40 minutes later . A spokesman for the school told the Press Herald at the time: 'His friends describe him as really one top-notch guy.' Mr Bihlmaier, whose family comes from Kansas but who is now based in the Boston area, specializes in the business of healthcare, and is employed by medical provider Optum. He has previously worked at several other healthcare firms, as well as for the Department of Health and Human Services.","Nathan Bihlmaier three times the legal drink-drive limit when he fell in water .

More than 300,000 tickets to the London 2012 Games were never sold, despite millions of people jamming official websites in the hope of witnessing sporting history. A total of 263,824 tickets to Olympic competitions were never sold along with 55,455 tickets to the Paralympic Games, including thousands of tickets to the main Olympic Park in East London. Olympics chiefs were today challenged to come clean about which events were not sold out and why sports fans were told to stay away when tens of thousands of seats remained empty. TV viewers were furious when they saw empty seats in the early stages of the London Olympics. Here former PM Sir John Major and wife Norma are seen surrounded by spare chairs . The revelation is likely to provoke a furious response from those people who tried in vain to get tickets to what was billed as the greatest show on earth. Around 1.2 million people - or two-thirds of applicants – were left empty-handed after the first round of ticket sales. In the early stages of the Games there was a backlash when TV cameras showed banks of empty seats. Eventually it was agreed that armed forces personnel drafted in to bolster security would be able to fill empty seats. Appearing at the London Assembly today, 2012 chairman Lord Coe and chief executive Lord Deighton were accused of being ‘selective’ about the data about which events were not sold out. It was suggested only people with ‘deep pockets’ were able to get tickets to the most coveted events because so few low-price seats were made available. Lord Deighton insisted trying to draw up a ticketing strategy was of ‘mind-numbing complexity'. He told the London Assembly: ‘We have so much data. You can come in and see it. You can go right through the database and see every ticket for every venue and at every price.’ Despite being hugely oversubscribed, some 284 tickets to the Olympic opening ceremony were not sold . In total, 263,824 tickets to the London Olympics went unsold to the UK public. It included 1,729 passes to visit the Olympic Park and 2,491 to climb the Orbit tower. For the Paralympics, 55,455 tickets were never sold, including big sporting events, day passes and Orbit tickets. Lord Deighton said: ‘The tickets that were not sold were tickets kept in contingency in the early days.’ Some 284 tickets were not sold for the Opening Ceremony out of a total of 104,149 that were available. Lord Deighton said some passes were held back while the positioning of the cauldron was tested. ‘We wanted to make sure that nobody got burnt, so we needed to test those before we released them.’ Lord Deighton, who ran the Olympic organising committee, said the ticketing system was of 'mind-numbing complexity' He added that ‘at very late notice, it may have been possible’ for someone to have bought those tickets. London 2012 raised £659 million from ticket sales, exceeding its £500 million target, towards the £2billion it needed to raise from the private sector to stage the Games. It sold 10.99 million tickets out of a total of 11.3 million available across the Olympics and Paralympics. This included 8.21 million tickets for the Olympics and 2.78 million for the Paralympics. Liberal Democrat Assembly member Stephen Knight said: ‘Obtaining detailed information from Locog about the sale of tickets for the Games has been like pulling teeth. Having refused to publish ticket information before the Games started, it is only now trickling out selective information.’","More than 263,000 tickets for the Olympics and 55,000 tickets for the Paralympics went unsold .

For this is the annual battle in a Spanish Mediterranean town which has staged the food fight fiesta for more than 60 years. Tens of thousands of revellers - some from as far as Japan and Australia -  took to the streets of Bunol, near Valencia, to join in the fun. Scroll down for video . Juiced up: Swimming in pulped tomatoes, a reveller enjoys the fun fight at the Spanish town of Bunol . Red alert: One smiling tourist is happy to be covered in tomato mush . In the soup: Lying in tomato pulp is just heaven for this reveller despite losing her mask . Splat: One of the tourists throws pulp from a bucket during the food fight which is known as the Tomatina . They pelted each other with 120 tonnes of ripe tomatoes on hand in five loaded trucks. This year, Brunol's town hall estimated about 40,000 people joined the hour-long fight known as Tomatina, which has its origins in a food fight between two boys in 1945. Many wore goggles and old clothes as they were drenched in the sea of red pips and pulp. And when they finished the town set up portable showers and opened up fire hydrants so they could shower off the stains. And once the battle was over, the streets and walls were hosed down, ready for next year's vegetable  party. Goggle-eyed: A girl wears protective goggles during the world's biggest tomato fight . What a sauce: A reveller lies smothered in tomato juice and pulp . Splattered: Three young men sit happily in a sea of squashed tomatoes . In 1945, young men who wanted to participate in a local parade staged a brawl picking up tomatoes from a nearby vegetable stand and using them as weapons. The police intervened to break it up, but the following year they repeated the fight, only this time they brought their own tomatoes. Over the years, the party was, albeit unofficially, established but was banned many times before it was officially sanctioned in 1959. The town of Bunol imposed a rule that people could only throw tomatoes after a horn sounded and should end when it sounded a second time. Revellers had to smash the tomato in their hands first and then throw it on each other. The festivities begin at around 10 am, with the first event of the Tomatina. The goal is to climb a greased pole with a ham on top. As this happens, the crowd work into a frenzy of singing and dancing while being showered with water from hoses. Once someone is able to drop the ham off the pole, the start signal for the tomato fight is given with a loud shot. Several trucks throw tomatoes in abundance in the Plaza del Pueblo. The tomatoes come from Extremadura, where they are less expensive and are grown specifically for the holidays, being of inferior taste. After exactly an hour, the fight ends with the firing of the second shot, announcing the end. The whole town square is colored red and rivers of tomato juice flow freely. Fire Trucks hose down the streets and participants use hoses that locals provide to remove the tomato paste from their bodies. After the cleaning, the village cobblestone streets are pristine due to the acidity of the tomato disinfecting and thoroughly cleaning the surfaces.","40,000 from as far as Australia  join in the fiesta ."

More than four years after her husband was shot to death while sleeping beside her, Melissa Oxley says she has forgiven the man who was eventually convicted in the murder, but wants his alleged accomplice held accountable. On February 21, 2008, Melissa Oxley was awakened at around 3:30am by a loud sound to discover her 36-year-old husband, Benjamin, dead in their bed from a gunshot wound to the back of the head. Melissa Oxley's 6-year-old stepdaughter, . Alyssa, was sleeping in a room nearby. When she heard the commotion, . Mellisa had to restrain the little girl from entering the bedroom to . check up on her dad, according to the Record-Courier. Scroll down for video . Slain: Benjamin Oxley, left, was shot to death in his home in February of 2008 while lying next to his wife, Melissa, pictured right . Oxley went downstairs and after seeing that the front door of their Minden, Nevada, home was unlocked, she called 911. When police had established that the killer did not break into the house, the victim's widow had unexpectedly found herself the prime suspect in the case. Prime suspect: After Ben Oxley's murder, his wife, Melissa, became a prime suspect in the probe, but was later cleared of all suspicions . Talking to Today host Ann Curry on Friday, Oxley said she was 'very numb at first and overwhelmed.' Oxley also added that she felt sick that she was being thought of as the murderer. Strong little girl: Benjamin Oxley received the custody of his daughter, Alyssa, after his divorce, and Melissa Oxley has been caring for her since the 2008 murder . Oxley was interrogated but released. In June of 2010, as her husband's murder case was growing cold, 24-year-old James Matlean, then-boyfriend of Benjamin Oxley's ex-wife, Dawn, was charged with the young father's murder. Criminal duo: James Matlean, left, was sentenced to a life in prison for Benjamin Oxley's murder, but says that the plot was hatched by Oxley's ex-wife, Dawn, pictured right . Dawn Oxley testified that Matlean had killed her ex-husband in an effort to please her. Ben and Dawn were divorced in 2004, and the father got custody of their daughter. Shortly before the murder, Dawn Oxley had been ordered to pay her ex-husband $200 in monthly child support. 'It’s done,' Matlean reportedly told Dawn Oxley after the murder. In February of 2010, she was granted immunity from prosecution for turning him in. Melissa Oxley was shocked to learn the identity of her husband's killer because after the murder, Matlean had been spending time with her stepdaughter. 'He lived with her for over 19 months afterwards,' Oxley said on the Today show. 'I saw him numerous times. He’d pick her up from my house for visitations together.' Matlean confessed to the crime and in . March of 2012 was sentenced to a life in prison without parole. However, . he has claimed that Dawn Oxley was the one who orchestrated the plot, . drew a diagram of the house and even accompanied him the night . of the murder. Matlean also said that his girlfriend wanted him to kill . Melissa Oxley as well and kidnap her daughter, but he was too scared and . fled. 'I'm taking full responsibility for . what I did,' Matlean said in an interview. 'Dawn needs to take full . responsibility for what she did.' Compassion: Melissa Oxley's 10-year-old stepdaughter, Alyssa, met with her father's killer and told him that she has forgiven him . Dawn Oxley, however, has denied her involvement in the murder, saying that while she had complained about her ex-husband, she would never go so far as to have him killed. Matlean’s attorney, Ken Stover, said the prosecutor made a deal with the devil. In her Today Show interview, Melissa Oxley agreed that Dawn bears responsibility for the murder of her husband and said that she should be punished for her role in it. The 39-year-old is currently serving a 90-month prison term for using an older daughter in multiple drug transactions, according to the Las Vegas Review-Journal. Melissa said that from the beginning, she told her stepdaughter that they would approach her father’s killer with compassion, no matter who it turned out to be. After Matlean was convicted, the girl, now 10, asked to speak to him and told him that she decided to forgive him. Melissa Oxley said she wants her stepdaughter to be able to grow up without anger. 'We have to still live our lives, so I thought it was super important for her to be able to go on with hers too,' she said.

But many parents will be shocked to learn just how costly it can be. After drilling down into the numbers, one New York mother has abandoned any plans to start a family after working out that it could set her back as much as $2million for each little darling. Expensive business: One New York woman (not pictured) has calculated that it costs nearly $2million to raise a child in the city (image posed by models) Nadia Taha based her calculations on various outgoings, from childcare to college fees, needed to support a child in the city until the age of 25. Her verdict? Don't. Writing in The New York Times, she said: 'Most people want to be sure that they can buy and pay for a home, save up for an emergency fund and enjoy a comfortable retirement. 'My husband and I, both in our late 20s, share those kinds of goals with others like us, but it seems obvious that the single decision that can best help us achieve them is one that many newly married, affluent young adults don’t usually consider - don't have children.' Painful reading: Among the costs, Nadia Taha factored in health insurance, which she estimated would cost $4,000 per child a year . Mrs Taha, who says they earn slightly . less than the average couple, used figures published by the Department . of Agriculture (DA) on what families spend on their children as the . foundation for her calculations, but tailored them to her personal . situation. According to the DA, couples in her income bracket in the urban Northeast spend $22,760 to $27,720 per child every year. But she says it omits other expenses like college and uses a cut-off of 17 years of age. For basic needs, such as food, transport, clothing and entertainment, she based her maths on the costs of raising children in a two-parent family in the urban Northeast area with a combined income of more than $103,350. She established that primary child care in New York would set her back between $12,750 to $16,000 then added the cost of schooling from grades 1 to 12. Need deep pockets: Nadia Taha (not pictured) based her calculations on various outgoings, from childcare to college fees, needed to support a child in the city until the age of 25 (file image) Adding a dependent to her health insurance would cost $4,000 a year, while saving enough to pay for just half of the college tuition would require a further $5,328 a year. Writing on the Times' Bucks Blog after her initial article, Mrs Taha also factored in losses of around $700,000 for maternity leave. Along with other spending, she estimated the total cost to be just shy of $2million. She said: 'If we were to have a child and do what most other parents do by trying to give this new little life the very best start possible, it would probably cost us $1.8million.'","Nadia Taha worked out expenses from Department of Agriculture figures .

Grayson Wolfe's house in DC: This is where Natalie's estranged husband lives with their four-year-old son . Allen is currently under investigation by the FBI after the agency discovered between 20,000 and 30,000 pages of communication between him and Jill Kelley. If he is found to have engaged in an extramarital affair - a crime in the military - he faces being thrown out, bringing a spectacular fall from grace and the end to a glittering army career that has spanned nearly 40 years. Meanwhile, Petraeus unknowingly filed his letter as he was simultaneously being investigated by the FBI after Kelley went to them with a number of viscous emails warning her to 'back off' and 'stay away from my guy'. Though they were anonymous, they have since been traced back to his mistress and biographer Paula Broadwell. The New York Post reported the former CIA chief wrote the letter just two months ago, supporting a motion to overturn a ruling made almost a year earlier by a judge. At this time, the judge resoundingly denied custody to Natalie Khawam, saying he had serious concerns and reservations over her mental stability and her grasp on reality. He also cited her with 'outrageous conduct', 'bad faith litigation tactics', and . 'illogical thinking' before awarding full custody to the father - who had been unable to see his child for more than a year. According to court documents, Petraeus wrote in the September 20 letter to the DC judge: 'My wife and I have known Natalie for approximately three years, getting to know her while serving in Tampa, Florida, through our friendship with Dr and Mrs Scott Kelley. 'It is clear to me that [child’s name] would benefit from much more time with his Mother and from removal of the burdensome restrictions imposed on her when she does get to spend time with him.' The former CIA chief added that he had observed Natalie and her son, 'including when we hosted them and the Kelley family for Christmas dinner this past year. In each case, we have seen a very loving relationship – a mother working hard to provide her son enjoyable, educational and developmental experiences'. Scandal: Gen. John Allen, pictured before the . Senate Armed Services Committee in March as his wife and daughter look . on, is under investigation for sending 'inappropriate emails' to a . military party planner . General John Allen reportedly exchanged 20,000 to 30,000 emails with Jill Kelley, the woman who sparked the probe into the CIA boss . Jealous: Jill Kelley, far right, with her husband, Scott, and Holly Petraeus outside the $1.3m house they shared with her twin sister Natalie, who has also been dragged into the scandal . From left: Jill Kelley with Anne Petraeus, her mother Holly Petraeus and twin sister Natalie Khawam . A separate letter from Allen, the top commander in Afghanistan, dated two days later said: 'Natalie clearly loves [child’s name] and cherishes each and every opportunity she has to spend time with him. She is a dedicated mother. 'In light of Natalie’s maturity, integrity and steadfast commitment to raising her child, I humbly request your reconsideration of the existing mandated custody settlement.' He said he got to observe the mother and child 'at command social functions'. According to the Post, a judge in November 2011 gave Wolfe sole custody of the couple’s son after finding that Khawam, a lawyer, repeatedly lied under oath and filed false domestic-violence and child-abuse claims against her husband. She was also accused of defying court orders to allow her estranged husband access to their son and sent emails to his friends and colleagues telling them he was a 'horrible father and husband'. She was reprimanded for giving false evidence and a psychiatrist found the allegations against her ex-husband were a 'part of an ever-expanding set of sensational accusations...that are so numerous, so extraordinary and so distorted that they defy any common-sense view of reality.' But Khawam's troubles don't just end there. She is also currently being sued in Montgomery County for failing to pay the lawyer's fees in her divorce - believed to be in the region of $100,000. The case has been on the court docket for nearly a-year-and-a-half but took a backward step in April when she filed for bankruptcy. A Woman Scorned? It is being claimed that the affair between David Petraeus and Paula Broadwell emerged after she sent threatening emails to Ms Kelley . Successor: Allen last year took over from Petraeus as head of Western troops in Afghanistan . On the bankruptcy filing, . Khawam lists $3.2 million in unpaid . debt, plus $53,000 she owes the Internal Revenue Service. Earlier this year, the 37-year-old's former employer, prominent Tampa Bay lawyer Barry Cohen, claimed that she 'fraudulently omitted Rolex watches, sable mink furs and a diamond ring' from her list of assets in the April bankruptcy. In July of this year, Khawam and her attorney Will Florin sued Cohen on six counts including sexual harassment and breach of contract claims. She said that Cohen owed her money and failed to properly take action when she reported a sexual harassment . issue involving a financial officer doing work for the law firm. According to the Tampa Bay Times, Cohen is trying to dismiss the case and is fighting back with claims of perjury and bankruptcy fraud against Khawam. He told the paper he has been delving into her background ever since the filing and, as well as discovering the bankruptcy documents, he found the 19-page child custody order from the Washington DC, superior court judge calling her out in 2011 for a lengthy 'history of abusing the litigation process' and a 'willingness to say anything, even under oath, to advance her own personal interests'. Cohen said in August the lawsuit has only further inspired him to continue advocating for his own clients. 'It takes a long time to build a good reputation, and it only takes a one accusation to tear it down,' Cohen said. 'What this did was re-inspire me to protect the people I protect. It makes me able to better empathize when they're falsely accused and gives me more motivation because I've been there.'","Natalie Khawam was described as 'psychologically unstable' by a judge, who ordered full custody of her son be given to her ex-husband Grayson Wolfe .

Brave: Captain James Fidell, The Royal Logistic Corps, is decorated with The Queen's Gallantry Medal, for Services in Afghanistan by the Princess Royal. The soldier detonated a 110lb bomb without body armour . Without a thought for his own safety, and without bomb suit, helmet or body armour, Captain James Fidell battled for eight hours to defuse a 110lb bomb. In the sweltering heat of a pitch black tunnel, a space so tight he was left with no option but to dispose of his protective gear, the 6ft5in solider had only one thing on his mind  'the job in hand.' The bomb was found under a road to the north east of Gereshk in Helmand Province, southern Afghanistan. If detonated it would not only have killed him but destroyed the road above and had severe consequences for local people. Now, the 29-year-old from the Royal Logistics Corps, has received the Queen's Gallantry Medal for his actions while on operation last year. Capt Fidell, of York, said he was 'flattered' to receive the award from the Princess Royal on Wednesday but insisted that 'brave stuff' was being done every day by other service personnel. He said: 'It is very flattering, it means a lot to me and to my family as well but I am massively conscious of the brave stuff that is done day in, day out.' Capt Fidell decided to make the improvised explosive device (IED) safe rather than to blow it up. If the the bomb been detonated, it would have damaged the local economy and made it easier for insurgents to plant more IEDs. Asked what he was thinking when he was inside the tunnel, Capt Fidell told the Telegraph: 'You just deal with the job in hand and you are focused on that. You don't really have time to worry.' The Royal Logistics Corps serviceman, from York, now works as an instructor teaching how to dispose of improvised explosive devices. After the ceremony, he paid tribute to his 'brave' colleagues and admitted he had been 'surprised' by how hot and humid the tunnel had been. Honour: Capt Fidell, of York, said he was .

Address: Johan Lever, pictured today, was accused of a £77,000 Olympic Games scam but was allowed to leave on bail despite only leaving behind an address 'on a mountain side' in Crete . A man accused of a £77,000 Olympics ticket scam this summer was allowed to leave the UK despite giving his address as ‘a mountain side’ in Crete. Johan Lever, 57, was released on bail after he was charged with money laundering offences relating to the illegal sale of 2012 Games seats. The Crown Prosecution Service has today expressed its concern that despite giving just a PO Box address in Crete he was still allowed to leave Britain. Mr Lever was only back at Westminster Magistrates Court today because he chose to come back to 'clear his name'. ‘He lives in a barren mountain side in Crete which is simply referred to by a Greek postal address’, prosecutor Edmund Hall said. ‘There isn’t a street name or anything.’ Lever, along with co-accused Lubor Pekarovic, is accused of selling tickets across England and Wales before laundering the proceeds through a series of bank accounts. Prosecutors say a ’significant amount of tickets’ were involved in the scam. Mr Hall said police were initially sceptical about releasing Lever on bail, but were reassured by further information. ‘Mr Lever was at large until very recently, having left the country sometime in August’, he said. ‘He voluntarily flew to this country last week and surrendered himself to police last Thursday. ‘It is a cliche but he says he has come here to clear his name. ‘The fact he gave a PO Box address was of considerable concern to the officers in the case. ‘But we have seen particular documentation, images and photos.’ He added: ‘Given his conduct so far, we would not be particularly concerned.’ Confusion: Lever gave a PO Box on the Greek island (file picture) and only returned to Britain to clear his name . Miranda Ching, defending, said Lever has been living in a hotel since returning to the UK and has surrendered his passport. ‘The address he lives at is about a kilometre outside the nearest town’, she said. ‘Police have previously written to the address and he responds to the correspondence by phoning the police.’ Lever worked as a tour operator in the Netherlands until around five years ago and has continued working sporadically since, she added. Scam: Lever, along with co-accused Lubor Pekarovic, is accused of selling Olympics tickets across England and Wales . He moved his family to Crete when he went into semi-retirement. District Judge Michael Snow sent the case to Snaresbrook Crown Court on November 20, when Lever will appear in the dock alongside Pekarovic.

Former Liberal MP Sir Cyril Smith yesterday became the latest public figure to be accused of sexually abusing children. Sir Cyril, who tipped the scales at up to 29 stone, inflicted humiliating punishments on boys at a hostel in the early 1960s, the House of Commons was told. The claims were later investigated by police but no case was brought against Sir Cyril, who died two years ago  aged 82. Accusation: Sir Cyril Smith, left, was accused by Rochdale MP Simon Danczyuk in the House of Commons yesterday of sexually abusing children at a hostel during the 1960s . Yesterday, however, as two former residents of the hostel spoke out for the first time about the alleged abuse, his successor as Rochdale MP Simon Danczuk publicly accused him. Sir Cyril’s appearance on one of Jimmy Savile’s BBC television shows in the early 1970s may now form part of a review of claims of abuse on the corporation’s premises. Labour’s Mr Danczuk told the Commons during a debate that Sir Cyril, a high-profile political figure for decades, used to summon boys from the town’s Cambridge House hostel and slap their naked bottoms. ‘Young boys were humiliated, terrified and reduced to quivering wrecks by a 29st bully imposing himself on them,’ he said. Larger than life: Sir Cyril Smith died in 2010 . He had seen statements given to Lancashire Police in the late 1960s, which made ‘grim reading’. ‘For some unknown reason, Cyril Smith had a kind of disciplinarian role at the hostel and was given free rein to administer punishment to the boys,’ he added. He said one of the boys told police: ‘He told me to take my trousers and pants down and bend over his knee. He hit me many times with his bare hands and I pleaded with him to stop because he was hurting me.’ Mr Danczuk said he believed the file had been passed to the Director of Public Prosecutions at the time, but no action was taken, and called for a new police investigation. Linking the claims with the scandal of sexual abuse of girls by Asian gangs in his constituency, he said: ‘Attempts to suppress the truth are not new in Rochdale. ‘The culture of cover-up stretches back much further than the recent grooming scandal, and extends right to the heart of our political establishment.’ Claims about Sir Cyril – who was elected to Parliament in 1972 and represented Rochdale for 20 years – first surfaced publicly in 1979 in a local magazine. He threatened legal action but later backed down. As a local councillor, Sir Cyril had played a key role in setting up Cambridge House – a hostel for working boys – in 1962 and allegedly had keys to the building. One ex-resident, Barry Fitton, who was 15 at the time, said that as well as intrusive ‘medical examinations’ he had been forced to strip and have his buttocks slapped. ‘He was big and he was heavy,’ he told the PoliticsHome.com website. ‘Imagine how that would feel slapping you around.’ Another, Eddie Shorrock, who was 17 at the time, claimed Sir Cyril used to force him to strip for ‘medical examinations’ if he called in sick. He claimed Sir Cyril – then in his 30s – would tell him to ‘drop your underpants and spin round, twirl round’. A third ex-resident has contacted solicitors representing alleged victims of Jimmy Savile.  But Sir Cyril’s brother Norman, now 80, hit out at Mr Danczuk’s claims. ‘I think it’s disgusting that he’s making accusations like this against someone who’s no longer here to defend himself,’ he said. ‘ . Sir Cyril was a guest on an edition of Jimmy Savile’s show Clunk Click broadcast in 1973 when the MP sang She’s a Lassie from Lancashire. A BBC spokesman said ‘any relevant information’ would be passed to Dame Janet Smith’s inquiry into culture and practices at the corporation.

A Post Office worker who stole £6,000 . of takings claimed the money went missing because she had accidentally . thrown it in the bin. Elaine Murray, 44, texted her boss to . say she had unknowingly scooped up the takings along with hundreds of . discarded leaflets before throwing the cash away. Murray, from Inverness, was . originally charged with embezzling £21,000 from the Post Office but . yesterday pleaded guilty to the lesser charge of stealing £6,000 at . Inverness Sheriff Court. However, her plea has angered Innes . MacDonald, sub postmaster at Kinmylies Post Office, Inverness, who said . he was left with a shortfall of almost £22,000 from the time that Murray . worked there. Shocked: Innes MacDonald, pictured with Murray's original text, said when he saw the message 'the bottom of my stomach fell out'. He is still attempting to repay the debt at a rate of £350 a month. Mr MacDonald said he does not know what happened to the missing money. He said his 'stomach just fell out' when he read the text from Murray in September, 2009. It read: 'Innes I have been meaning . to tell u this, but didn’t know how to, the reason i am short in the . post office is because while cleaning out 1 day, i had the big bin in . from through the back and everything was all over the floor and it went . in the bin with hundreds of leaflets i had on the floor, i didn’t know . how to tell u, i should have told u when i realised.' He said yesterday: 'I asked her what she meant and how much money it was that she had put in the bin. 'At that point I could have cried. She said it was about 12 weeks or so before that she had done it. Thief: Elaine Murray will be sentenced next month after admitting stealing £6,000 that she had claimed she accidentally threw in the bin. 'Confession': Mr MacDonald said he 'could have cried' when Murray falsely claimed over text message that she had thrown thousands of pounds in the bin. Furious: Mr MacDonald said he is 'absolutely raging' that Murray, who was originally charged with embezzling £21,000, pleaded guilty to the lesser charge of stealing £6,000. 'We phoned round the bin companies and so on, but there was no trace of it.' Murray was employed as manager at the post office at the time of the theft between January and September, 2009. She is due to be sentenced next month. But Mr MacDonald said he will demand an explanation from the procurator fiscal about why the lesser charge was brought. He said he has repaid more than £16,000 since the missing money was noticed more than three years ago. Mr MacDonald said: 'I am having to pay the Post Office back nearly £22,000 and I am still paying it back at £350 a month. I am absolutely raging. 'Because of this my three young kids have been deprived of a decent holiday for the last three years. 'I’m still shelling out for this. I’ve already paid back £16,000 and will have to continue paying for more than a year. 'Basically all the money I have paid back I will have to kiss goodbye to.' Mr MacDonald said as sub-postmaster he was liable for the money. He repaid an initial £5,000 when the money was first found to be missing and is still paying off the rest. He added: 'I was never told about the plea and that the figure would be reduced from nearly £22,000 to £6,000. I have been let down big time by the Crown Office. 'The question is what happened to the money?' At yesterday’s hearing Sheriff William Taylor said he did not want to hear the details at this stage and will await reports.

A failed asylum-seeker was handed thousands of pounds in compensation yesterday by European judges who claimed British law had failed to protect her from being treated as a slave. The Ugandan came to Britain illegally on a false passport, became a care worker and was free to leave the house where she worked, the European Court of Human Rights heard. Police investigating the 33-year-old's case decided she was a criminal and a British judge cast doubt on her credibility, describing her story as 'implausible'. Controversial: An illegal immigrant was today handed thousands of pounds in compensation by European human rights judges on the grounds that British law failed to protect her from slavery. The European Court of Human Rights is pictured . But the Strasbourg judges ruled that the woman, whose identity they shielded, suffered a breach of her rights as there was no UK law at the time specifically banning slavery. They ordered the Government to pay her £23,500, made up of £7,000 in compensation and £16,500 in expenses and costs. The judgment marks another case in which Britain has been told that Acts of Parliament and common law have been inadequate to meet European demands. Since then, the 2009 Coroners and Justice Act has been passed which specifically outlaws slavery. However, Prime Minister David Cameron remains at odds with Strasbourg over the human rights judges' demand that Britain allows convicted prisoners to vote. The woman in the slavery case – identified only as CN – came to this country in 2002 on a false  passport and visa provided by her uncle, identified only as PS. He set her up as a care worker for an Iraqi couple in Leeds and £1,600 a month was paid for the work. But, the woman alleged, the money was given to her uncle and she was never paid more than £20 or £40 when she was given an afternoon off each month. Frustration: David Cameron remains at odds with Strasbourg over the human rights judges' demand that Britain pass laws to allow convicted prisoners to vote in elections . She did not complain until 2006, four years later, when she collapsed in a bank and was treated in  hospital after it was discovered she was HIV positive. CN was given a flat by her local council, but her application for  asylum, on the grounds she had fled sexual and physical violence in Uganda, failed. Police investigations ended in 2009 following two inquiries into the woman's complaints that she was held as a slave. A report from the Metropolitan Police Human Trafficking Team noted that she had been refused legitimate entry into Britain and had come in with a false passport and forged visa. The woman had been paid through her relative 'in order to hide from the authorities the fact that the victim did not have a national insurance number'. The report went on: 'If money was paid to her, then she would have had to pay tax and her false identity would have come to the notice of the tax office. This would then lead to her arrest and eviction from the UK. 'There is no evidence to show that this female is a victim of slavery or forced labour. She willingly worked and was paid but she chose that the money should go to her uncle  to conceal being in the UK. It is basically a situation that one criminal, her uncle, has taken all the proceeds of their crime.' The British judge who heard CN's asylum appeal 'expressed  serious concerns about the applicant's credibility and found much of her account to be implausible', the Strasbourg court heard. But the European judges said that, because police investigated the complaints, they could not have been considered implausible. They insisted that the woman's complaints were credible. The court added that the inquiry should not have been carried out by a police unit dealing with human trafficking rather than slavery. Britain was also obliged to prosecute any act aimed at enforcing slavery. The country's law was 'inadequate' for the purpose, the European judges declared.","An investigation by police officers found she was NOT a victim of slavery and was a criminal .

They have grown up without any respect for their elders or any idea of how to bring up a child.’ Yesterday Dr Wright said she was not suggesting that mothers and fathers needed parenting classes but said schools had a key role to play in providing support. The GSA launched its own website – My Daughter – to provide information and advice on all aspects of educating and raising girls. ‘We need to take away the stigma for parents that they have to know everything,’ she said. ‘I think there’s lots of good advice out there, but people are afraid to be seen to be taking it.’ On Saturday, Dr Wright, head of private boarding school St Mary’s Calne in Wiltshire, warned that TV talent shows, such as The X Factor, damage children by glamorising bullying and arrogance.","Headmistress says letting youngsters dress in sexy clothing is a sign of society’s eroded moral values .

It has been a staple of the Japanese diet for centuries but now seaweed could be making a more pronounced appearance on UK menus after being commercially harvested in England for the first time. Retired lawyer Rory MacPhee, 56, is the only person in the country with official permission to gather dulse seaweed which commands prices of up to £200 a kilogram. He has been given his licence by the Queen through the Crown Estate. Collection: Rory MacPhee was given an experimental licence by the Crown Estate to handpick seaweed from around the Lizard Peninsula . Tucking into a clump of seaweed at dinner time could help stave off heart attacks, say researchers. They have discovered key ingredients in the plant that help lower blood pressure, similar to commonly prescribed drugs. According to a major study in 2011, seaweed is a rich source of proteins known as bioactive peptides – which are also found in milk. These chemicals have a similar effect to ACE inhibitor drugs, which are widely prescribed to help lower blood pressure and prevent heart attacks and strokes. The . edible seaweed is much sought after as a delicacy but it cannot be . collected and sold without permission from landowners and environment . agencies. Seaweed is very low in calories and some scientists claim it helps weight loss by preventing the absorption of fat. Japanese researchers found that rats fed a certain type of seaweed lost 10 per cent of their weight. Mr MacPhee of Falmouth, Cornwall, said people already harvesting seaweed for sale in England are doing so illegally. He says he hopes British consumers will take the healthy 'sea vegetable' to their hearts - like the Japanese. It is worth up to £200 a kilo to restaurants, hotels and sushi shops where it is served up to diners. Experimental: He will be the first in England to work his way along the coast harvesting what he needs from the massive swathes of algae floating around the shore . Rory said: 'Seaweed is rich in nutrients and extremely tasty - a lot of the top chefs are beginning to use it in their dishes. 'It can be used in soup and bread and its even a substitute for bacon when smoked. 'You . can go out and forage for seaweed or dandelion leaves or whatever as . long as you are doing it for you or your family to eat. 'But if you are going to sell it then you need a licence. 'You need permission from the landowner, conservation agencies, and to have food management systems in place.' Taking off: Seaweed is rarely eaten in Britain but has been a staple of the Japanese diet for centuries . Dulse seaweed is popular in Japan where it is a key ingredient used to achieve the so-called fifth taste, known as 'umami.' Mr MacPhee gathers the seaweed along the Cornish coast and then flattens out the leaves before laying it on rocks to sun-dry. The seaweed is then dried and cured and ground into strips and a powder and poured into test tubes and sold. Mr MacPhee  a boatbuilder and furniture-maker, said areas for growth in seaweed harvesting could include putting up ropes for it to grow on by offshore windfarms. He . said: ""In these days of economic doom and gloom the food market remains . strong, with a tremendously exciting new development in the gathering . and selling of sea vegetables."" Mr MacPhee  is a founding member of the Seaweed Health Foundation which has around 40 members across the country. Its aim is to promote research into seaweed as part of a healthy diet. Among . well-known fans is Heston Blumenthal, who has recommended using kelp – . or seaweed – to make NHS food more flavoursome without using additional . salt. The idea is to . increase levels of umami - a Japanese term for the so-called fifth taste . after sweet, sour, bitter and salty - which is a flavour found in foods . such as parmesan cheese, tomatoes and shiitake mushrooms .

IKEA has expressed regret that it benefited from the use of forced prison labour by some of its suppliers in communist East Germany more than two decades ago. The Swedish furniture giant released a report showing that East German prisoners, among them many political dissidents, were involved in the manufacture of goods that were supplied to IKEA 25 to 30 years ago. The report concluded that IKEA managers were aware of the possibility that prisoners would be used in the manufacture of its products and took some measures to prevent this, but they were insufficient. Scroll down for video . 'Regret': IKEA has apologised after it emerged it stocked products manufactured through forced prison labour in East Germany 25 to 30 years ago . 'We deeply regret that this could happen,' said Jeanette Skjelmose, an IKEA manager. 'The use of political prisoners for manufacturing was at no point accepted by IKEA.' But she added that 'at the time we didn’t have the well-developed control system that we have today and we clearly did too little to prevent such production methods.' IKEA commissioned auditors Ernst & Young to look into allegations aired by a Swedish television documentary in June, but first raised by a human rights group in 1982. Rainer Wagner, chairman of the victims’ group UOKG, said IKEA was just one of many companies that benefited from the use of forced prison labor in East Germany from the 1960s to 1980s. 'IKEA is only the tip of the iceberg,' he said. Flat-pack furniture giant: IKEA ordered a report into allegations made by a Swedish TV documentary this year, but first aired by a human rights group back in 1982 . Wagner said he hoped that IKEA and others would consider compensating former prisoners, many of whom carry psychological and physical scars from arduous labor they were forced to do. 'IKEA has taken the lead on this, for which we are very grateful,' he told a news conference in Berlin, where the findings of the report were presented. Peter Betzel, the head of IKEA Germany, said the company would continue to support efforts to investigate the use of prisoners in East Germany in future. He said: ‘We can exclude with almost 100 percent certainty that such things as happened in East Germany happen elsewhere.’","East German prisoners, including many political dissidents, were involved in the manufacture of goods supplied to IKEA 25 to 30 years ago .

PC David Gudgeon was spared points on his licence after the judge deemed his case 'exceptional' A police officer who crashed into the side of a bus after running a red light during a car chase walked free from court today. PC David Gudgeon, 37, careered into the packed vehicle as he tailed a car leaving a 'drugs hotspot'. However, the officer did not activate the sirens or blue lights on his unmarked car because he did not want to alert the driver of the suspect motor. The PC was fined £350 after he admitted driving without due care and attention at Westminster Magistrates' Court. He was spared penalty points on his licence after a judge said the case was 'exceptional'. PC Gudgeon started the car chase when he noticed the suspect Vauxhall Corsa leaving the Thistlebrook Industrial Estate in Abbey Wood, London, at around 9pm last March 28. The officer, who had only became an advanced police driver last year, had already overtaken the car so went around the roundabout at the junction of Harrow Manor Way and Eastern Way to get behind the Corsa so he could check its number plate. However as they approached traffic lights westbound less than 25 seconds later, the Corsa, which had a front headlight out, sped through the green light and as the two officers followed in their unmarked Vauxhall Zafira, the light turned to red. PC Gudgeon said: 'It was going faster than a normal member of the public would travel, and a lot of the local criminals are aware of our unmarked vehicles. 'I wasn't closing the gap significantly enough to be able to get an ID on the number plate. 'If I'd have put my two-tone sirens on straight away - if that vehicle had something on board of interest - we would have lost it straight away. It was 300 yards in front of us.' He added that he felt it necessary to check the number plate before stopping the car in case the three passengers were armed or dangerous, so decided to go through the red light in pursuit. PC Gudgeon then tailed the vehicle along into the Thamesmead estate along Eastern Way and noticed a bus at the junction of Nathan Way but presumed it was going straight on. High-speed chase: PC Gudgeon's car smashed into a bus at the traffic lights near the junction of Harrow Manor Way and Eastern Way . He said it had then unexpectedly turned right and straight into the path of his car as he went through a red traffic light. PC Gudgeon, who was travelling within the speed limit at 37mph, then drove into the front side of the bus. Colin Reynolds, for Gudgeon, said: 'He simply misjudged the position of the bus and accepts he made a mistake.' None of the 25 passengers or the driver of the bus was injured in the crash, which caused severe damage to the police car. District Judge John Zani said the incident had exceptional circumstances and PC Gudgeon had made the right decision not to use his flashing lights or sirens. He added: 'This vehicle was being driven with only one headlight functioning and you made the decision, quite rightly in my opinion, to monitor its movements. 'This case really turns on one decision you made. It's a decision you made to drive through the red signal. It's as simple as that. 'I do say that this is one of those rare cases where I'm satisfied that it's not appropriate to endorse your licence.' PC Gudgeon, from Aylesford, Kent, admitted driving without due care and attention.

Food writer Katherine Whiteman died in a road accident less than an hour after landing in Argentina . A top food writer, who edited books featuring recipes from Raymond Blanc and Pierre Koffman, died after being thrown from a car in an accident less than an hour after she landed in Argentina. Katherine Whiteman, 63, was thrown through the window after the car she was travelling in with her barrister husband Peter Whiteman QC and a translator hit a verge and somersaulted. She died on the road after the car landed on top of her and continued to roll. In a statement, Mr Whiteman, a corporate barrister, said that he began frantically searching for his wife was after the car came to a halt on National Highway 231. He said: 'I began to desperately ask where she was. I looked around the car and saw my wife lying face down, losing a lot of blood. ""I took my wife's wrist to take her pulse, but I never managed to get one.' Less than an hour earlier the couple had landed at Bariloche Airport and had hired a driver to take them to their hotel in Villa La Angostura. Mr Whiteman's statement said that the car had skidded a number of times and the driver had repeatedly swerved to avoid oncoming traffic in the lead up to the crash. He said: ‘Some 15 minutes before the accident I noticed the driver, on four or five occasions, was taking corners at speeds of about 110km an hour.’ The vehicle flipped several times and performed a barrel-roll after hitting a verge, skidding on its side before coming to a rest on all four tyres. Southwark Coroner's Court heard that Mr Whiteman, who specialises in all areas of corporate and commercial tax, and the interpreter had to climb out of the cars broken windows as the doors were jammed shut following the crash. They moved Mrs Whiteman because she appeared to be choking on her own blood, but by the time the emergency services arrived, she had died. Mrs Whiteman, who was born in Hampstead, north London, was pronounced dead at around 2pm on January 4, 2009. Following an investigation by Argentinean authorities, her body was repatriated to the UK. The investigations revealed that the driver of the silver Volkswagen Golf, Fabian Peyregne, had been driving at a dangerous speed of at least 71.3km an hour.

Coroner Andrew Harris said: ‘The evidence suggests that she was only alive for a few minutes and died on the road side having been thrown out of the car from which the other three people exited through the window. ‘It is clear from the report that the car skidded, left the road and somersaulted. ‘The speed at which that vehicle was going was not safe. The driver was charged and found guilty of death by negligence.’ Mrs Whiteman's husband Peter Whiteman QC, pictured, had to crawl from the wreckage of the crash that killed his wife . Dr Harris recorded that Mrs Whiteman of Dulwich, southeast London, died of multiple injuries. He ruled that her death was an accident. Mrs Whiteman, a member of the Guild of Food Writers, was the author of several books, including Brittany Gastronomique, The Italian Cook, Love Food Love Paris and The World Encyclopedia of Fish and Shellfish. She was inspired to get into cooking by her Italian grandmother and her early career saw her work on the Supercook partwork, which featured a mix of 3,000 different recipes. She was also the editor of two of the most significant books on French cuisine published in this country - Raymond Blanc’s Recipes from Le Manoir aux Quat’ Saisons and Pierre Koffmann’s Memories of Gascony. She worked on 11 books with legendary chef Michel Roux, whom she introduced herself to at the Waterside Inn in Bray, and wrote some 30 books in her own right. As well as working on books, the former BBC production editor was a restaurant inspector for the Good Food Guide and a prominent member of the Food Writer's Guild. Mrs Whiteman, a graduate in French and Italian at Trinity College in Dublin, supported several campaigns including the Guild of Food Writer's Hospital Campaign. In a eulogy read at Mrs Whiteman's funeral by her husband he described her as 'unique' and 'full of fun'. He added: 'Her knowledge of food, ingredients, recipes and cooking techniques was encyclopaedic. 'The books she wrote were a joy to read, the recipes were always easy to follow, and they worked – according to all of those who tried them out. Her meals and hospitality were legendary – the food she prepared was exquisite. 'For all her talents and qualities, Kate was a truly modest person. She was also totally genuine, extremely intelligent and full of common sense. 'She was, of course, elegant, glamorous, charming, graceful, sensitive and so very kind. She was warm, compassionate, loving, vibrant and radiant.' She is survived by her husband, Peter and two daughters, Victoria and Caroline.

A woman accused of murdering her son for failing to learn parts of the Koran by heart made a harrowing video confession which was shown to a jury today. Sara Ege, 32, allegedly beat seven-year-old Yaseen to death with a stick and then burned his body in an attempt to destroy the evidence of her brutality. Ege made an emotional confession to the police within days of Yaseen’s death at their home in Cardiff in July 2010. Beaten: Yaseen Ali, seven, was allegedly beaten by his mother for failing to learn parts of the Koran by heart . A jury at Cardiff Crown Court listened in silence today as she described how Yaseen collapsed, still murmuring extracts from the Koran. Asked why she had set his body on fire within minutes of his death, she said: 'I was too nervous.' Yaseen had been hit with a stick for failing to memorise extracts from the Koran and was still injured at the time of his death, she said. 'He was swollen from a couple of weeks ago,' Ege said in the interview. A sobbing Ege was allowed to leave the dock while the harrowing hour-long footage was shown to the jury. In it, she described undressing Yaseen when he collapsed and soiled himself, then dragging him to the kitchen to feed him milk. The boy was left lying naked on the kitchen floor, still reciting extracts from the Koran, as she poured him the drink. He then took several sips before being dragged and pushed along a corridor to his bedroom and told to get dressed by his mother. When he proved incapable, she dressed him herself and left him on a rug by his bed, claiming she believed he had fallen asleep. Ten minutes later, she returned to witness Yaseen shaking and shivering on the floor and gulping a final breath before dying. Funeral: Cardiff Crown Court has heard Ege grew increasingly frustrated with her seven-year-old son . Tragedy: Ege allegedly hit her child with a stick and then burnt his body . 'A greenish yellow liquid came from his nose and I saw that he was gone,' she said. Within moments Ege said she decided to burn his body and ran downstairs to get a lighter and a bottle of barbecue gel. Ege, of Pontcanna, Cardiff, later retracted the confession made to the police over several days in July 2010. She denies a single charge of murder and a charge of perverting the course of justice. Her husband, Yusef Ali Ege, 38, is on trial with his wife, accused of causing or allowing the death of his son by failing to act. In the recording shown in court, Ege describes trying to pick up Yaseen after he collapsed but ending up 'dragging him along the corridor'. 'When I spoke to him he just recited the Koran and said ‘Yes, Mum, yes, Mum, yes, Mum,” Ege states in the interviews. When she reached his bedroom she left her naked son on a rug by his bed while she went to get him some clothes. 'He was still reciting what he had been reading and I gave him his clothes and he would not put them on. He was just saying ‘Yes, Mum, yes, Mum’, so I thought I would put them (the clothes) on for him. 'I had to treat him like a baby. Then he slept and I thought ‘OK, I will go now’. He was still murmuring the Koran. 'He was breathing as if he was asleep when I left him. He was still murmuring the same thing over and over again. I thought that he was just tired.' Scene: Police and firefighters rushed to the family home in Pontcanna, Cardiff, after the blaze broke out in July 2010 . Ege said in interview that Yaseen had collapsed in a similar way about six weeks earlier and had been fine after a night’s sleep. Earlier, the jury was told about the work regime the youngster had to follow, which included Koran classes after school and at weekends. Ege went on to describe finding her son gulping before he died only minutes after she had left him apparently sleeping soundly. 'I went into his room and I went to Yaseen and he was making a funny gulping-like noise and his mouth was going very funny. 'He was lying on his side on the rug facing the bed with a greenish yellow liquid coming from his nose. I saw him twitching. 'It was like he was gone. I tried to wake him up and I tried to lift him up. But his heart was not beating. I thought ‘Yaseen has gone’.” She added: 'I was there. I was tapping him, I was lifting him up, I was shouting ‘Yaseen’. I was looking at myself in the mirror and pulling my hair. 'I was getting angry with myself and went downstairs because Yaseen was gone.' Ege returned to the courtroom for the afternoon session when other DVD interviews were shown to the jury. Unrecorded sections of interviews with Ege were also read out by a police officer and one of the prosecution team’s barristers, David Elias. Ege also confessed that she was out of control and beat her son for almost no reason. She said she had made vows to herself not to hit him but had repeatedly broken them within days. A hush fell over the court as Ege described in interview setting the fire in the knowledge that he still had swollen ribs from his beatings. 'At the time I was not thinking of anything, I was just very scared. It is just the same thing over and over again, that I beat Yaseen when I used to take the stick. 'It was not my intention to do anything. I cannot explain, I loved my son so much. He was so good. He never, ever complained about anything.' She added: 'I just blame my anger. I lost control. I cannot put all this together. There was no intention in me to harm my son.' During the interviews she said after beating Yaseen on one occasion he had gone to school in such pain he was unable to sit. He was sent home and Ege managed to switch him to another school where staff were told he had a leg injury which prevented him sitting. Yaseen’s death was originally believed to have been a tragic accident, the court has heard. It was only discovered later that he was already dead before the blaze had been lit. The trial was adjourned until tomorrow. The prosecution case is expected to concluded either on Friday or early on Monday next week.

Double beds could be installed in NHS maternity units to allow fathers to keep their partners company. Hospitals will be told that, at the very least, they must offer spare beds for men who want to remain close by when mother and baby need to stay, such as after a complicated birth. Larger birthing pools could also be provided so that fathers can join mothers during water births. Father figure: The £25m scheme is aimed at getting men more involved with childbirth . The plans are part of a £25million scheme to get men more involved in childbirth. But the cost is likely to cause concern at a time when NHS maternity services face cutbacks across the country – while the birth rate continues to soar. Under the proposals, hospitals will be able to bid for the money to add facilities such as double beds and larger birthing pools to their labour wards. Health minister Dan Poulter said the scheme would help keep families together and give them more support. He added: 'The period after a baby is born is clearly a very joyous time but it is also a very stressful time. Relationships are most likely to break up in the year after a baby.' Dr Poulter insisted maternity units need to do more to involve fathers in childbirth and to ensure fathers are not sent away if their partner or child needs to stay in hospital. 'Hospitals need to respond to what women want, and what their families want,' he said. 'It might be a bigger birthing pool so that the mum and dad can both get in more easily – or it might be a question of providing double beds, so couples can be together when a premature baby has to stay in hospital.' In cases where women were confined to bed because of complications, units should provide spare beds for partners who wanted to be close at hand, he added. Spending: Double beds and larger birthing pools could be installed at NHS hopsitals . And he suggested funds should be devoted to providing comfort and privacy for bereaved parents, such as by making sure a woman who has lost a baby is not on the same ward as mothers with newborns. Ministers also plan to invest in expanding the NHS Information Service for Parents, an online service to help mothers and fathers. Dr Poulter said: 'There will now be £25million available to improve maternity facilities but not a penny of this will be given out unless there is evidence that women have been asked about the changes they want in their local areas – whether it's more ensuite facilities, overnight rooms for dads, birthing pools or other improvements.' Cathy Warwick, chief executive of the Royal College of Midwives, said: 'Any additional money is welcome. £25million is a relatively small sum compared to the annual budget for maternity services of around £2.5billion. 'However, it will help to make changes to the environment which can improve care.' But the RCM also warned last night that the biggest baby boom in 40 years is on its way – just as maternity cutbacks hit hospitals across the country. The latest figures suggest more than 700,000 babies will be born in England this year, the highest number since 1971.

BP will pay the fine over six years after reaching a deal with the United States Department of Justice (DoJ) and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) that has seen it plead guilty to 14 criminal charges relating to the oil rig accident in 2010, which killed 11 workers and spilled millions of barrels of oil into the Gulf of Mexico. Bob Dudley, chief executive of BP, said: 'We apologise for our role in the accident and as today's resolution with the US government further reflects, we have accepted responsibility for our actions.' Scroll down for video . Disaster: The April 2010 explosion at the Deepwater Horizon oil rig cost tens of billions of dollars in economic and environmental damage . Sheen: An oil slick covered 68,000 square miles of the gulf and washed ashore along 1,072 miles of coastline . Under the deal, BP has pleaded guilty . to 11 felony counts of misconduct or neglect and three misdemeanour . counts - including one under the Clean Water Act and one for obstructing . Congress. The record-breaking fine surpasses . even the $1.3billion (£820 million) fine paid by drugs group . Pfizer in 2009 for marketing fraud related to a pain medicine. BP will pay $4billion dollars (£2.5billion) to the DoJ in installments over five years. It will pay an additional $525million (£331million) to the SEC over a period of three years. BP will make the first payment of $175million (£110million) this year to the SEC. The group has already paid out more than $38billion (£24billion) relating to the oil spill. BP is hoping to wrap up its financial liabilities from the Deepwater Horizon disaster, but the overall impact on the Gulf Coast is still not known by researchers. Oil spewed into the Gulf of Mexico from the Macondo well for 87 days before it was finally capped. Some 68,000 square miles of the gulf were at one time covered in oil slick, about the area of Oklahoma. More than 6,000 seabirds, 600 turtles and 500 dolphins were found dead as a result of the spill. Many dolphins are still being found sick from apparent oil contamination and zooplankton have recently found to show traces of oil, as well. The full impact of the oil spill will not be estimated until the government releases its Natural Resource Damage Assessment, which will collect data from dozens of ongoing studies of the gulf. Mr Dudley said: 'All of us at BP . deeply regret the tragic loss of life caused by the Deepwater Horizon . accident as well as the impact of the spill on the Gulf coast region.' He added: 'Since the spill, we have worked hard to rebuild confidence in the company. 'We take seriously not only our . commitment to safety and operational excellence but also our . communications with stakeholders, including the public, the government . and our investors.' Today's settlement removes some of . the uncertainty hanging over the stock since the disaster, but it does . not cover outstanding civil claims against the group. BP said it will 'continue to vigorously defend itself' against civil claims and allegations of gross negligence. 'We are open to settlements, but only on reasonable terms,' said Mr Dudley. The deal could resolve a significant share of the liability that BP faces after an explosion killed 11 workers and fouled the shorelines of four Gulf Coast states in the worst offshore spill in U.S. history. BP still faces economic and environmental damage claims sought by U.S. Gulf Coast states and other private plaintiffs. It is unclear what form of criminal misconduct BP will plead guilty to. In an August filing, the Department of Justice said 'reckless management' of the Macondo well 'constituted gross negligence and willful misconduct,' which it intended to prove at a pending civil trial set to begin in New Orleans in February 2013. The U.S. government has not yet filed any criminal charges in the case. It is unclear whether the deal will resolve any civil charges brought by the Justice Department. It is also unclear how large a financial penalty BP might pay to resolve the charges, or other punishments that BP might face. Negligence is a central issue to BP's potential liability. A gross negligence finding could nearly quadruple the civil damages owed by BP under the Clean Water Act to $21billion in a straight-line calculation. According to the Justice Department, errors made by BP and Swiss-based Transocean Ltd, owner of the Deepwater Horizon platform, in deciphering a key pressure test of the Macondo well are a clear indication of gross negligence. Sickly: Thousands of birds, reptiles and dolphins died in the oil slick and many are still showing signs of contamination . 'That such a simple, yet fundamental and safety-critical test could have been so stunningly, blindingly botched in so many ways, by so many people, demonstrates gross negligence,' the government said in its August filing. The mile-deep Macondo well spewed 4.9million barrels of oil into the Gulf of Mexico over a period of 87 days. The torrent fouled shorelines from Texas to Florida and eclipsed in severity the 1989 Exxon Valdez spill in Alaska. After several failed attempts, BP finally capped the well on July 15, 2010, halting the flow of oil after more than 85 days and putting a stop to what became one of the most closely watched shows on TV and the Internet: the live spill-camera image of the gushing well. Nelda Winslette’s grandson Adam Weise of Yorktown, Texas, was killed in the blast. She said somebody needs to be held accountable. 'It just bothers me so bad when I see the commercials on TV and they brag about how the Gulf is back, but they never say anything about the 11 lives that were lost. They want us to forget about it, but they don’t know what they’ve done to the families that lost someone,' she said. The spill exposed lax government oversight and led to a temporary ban on deepwater drilling while officials and the oil industry studied the risks, worked to make it safer and developed better disaster plans. BP’s environmentally-friendly image was tarnished, and BP CEO Tony Hayward stepped down after the company’s repeated gaffes, including his statement at the height of the crisis: 'I’d like my life back.' BP has already announced an uncapped class-action settlement with private plaintiffs that the company estimates will cost $7.8billion to resolve litigation brought by over 100,000 individuals and businesses claiming economic and medical damages from the spill.","BP pleaded guilty to 14 criminal charges relating to incident that killed 11 workers and spilled millions of barrels of oil into the Gulf of Mexico .

China's new president Xi Jinping was officially introduced to the nation today, but to many Chinese citizens it is the face of his glamorous pop star wife that will appear far more familiar. The Communist Party leader-elect and powerful military chief is married to Peng Liyuan, the syrup-voiced megastar of popular Chinese folk music. Nicknamed the Peony Fairy, Ms Peng, 49, had graced television screens in the world's most populous country for more than a decade, her honeyed tones punctuating state-run TV shows watched by hundreds of millions of people. Ms Peng has become China's first high-profile political spouse since Jiang Qing, the late wife of Chairman Mao Zedong. Scroll down for video. Power couple: Xi Jinping is married to Peng Liyuan, the syrup-voiced megastar of popular Chinese folk music . Her huge success in the entertainment industry has run alongside her staunch loyalty to the Communist Party. She joined the People's Liberation Army aged 18 and rose to the rank of major-general, a post she still holds. But when her superiors discovered her talent for singing, she began touring army bases serenading troops in a programme designed to boost morale. From there her rise to fame was meteoric. She is best known for performing at CCTV's New Year's Gala - a show watched by hundreds of millions of people throughout China - almost every year since its inception in 1982. The Peony Fairy: Ms Peng had graced television screens in the world's most populous country for more than a decade, her honeyed tones punctuating state-run TV shows and Communist Party rallies . The new team: He and the six other men who will form China's new collective leadership, all dressed in dark suits, walked in line onto the red-carpeted stage. (L-R) Liu Yunshan, Zhang Dejiang, Xi Jinping, Li Keqiang, Yu Zhengsheng and Wang Qishan. Almost all of her songs are in praise . of the Communist Party and frequently appears on state television to . sing propagandist ballads with names including Plains of Hope and People From Our Village. In June 2011, she was even appointed World Health Organisation Goodwill Ambassador for HIV/Aids and tuberculosis. She has also shied away from appearing in public with her husband or talking about their relationship until recently, fuelling speculation that she may take a more active role in his presidency than any of her predecessors. In a rare interview in 2007, she told a state-run magazine: 'When he comes home, I’ve never thought of it as though there’s some leader in the house. 'In my eyes, he’s just my husband. When I get home, he doesn’t think of me as some famous star. In his eyes, I’m simply his wife.' But while hers is still one of the most . famous faces in the country, comparatively little is known of her . husband, a man who spent most of his teens living in a cave, labouring . in the fields of one of China's poorest regions. He is the son of Communist revolutionary general Xi Zhongxun, a comrade of Chairman Mao. But when he was in his teens, his father fell out with the Chairman and was sent to prison. Xi . was exiled to a far-flung, rural community of Liangjiahe, in Shaanxi . province, where he lived in cave-dwellings and was forced to labour in . the fields. Little more than 100 miles from Beijing, it is one of China's poorest regions. The family lived like peasants in a cave-like house carved out of the yellow rock formations that surrounded the village. He is quoted as saying no problems he has encountered in political life compare to the hardship he suffered as a young man. But he immersed himself in local . politics and soon rose the ranks before today assuming the top posts in . the Communist Party and the powerful military in a political transition . unbowed by scandals, a slower economy and public demands for reforms. Xi . was introduced as the new party general secretary at Beijing's Great . Hall of the People a day after the close of a week-long party congress . that underlined the communists' determination to remain firmly in power. Get used to this face: Xi's inaugural address as the country's new leader was broadcast on giant screens across China. Here, above a McDonald's in Beijing . No everyone's interested: A homeless man sleeps on the ground while people watch TV live broadcast of China's new members of the Politburo Standing Committee . Out with the old: President Hu Jintao, left, and senior leaders mostly in their . late 60s will hand over power to Xi Jinping, right, and other . colleagues in their late 50s over the next several months . New leader: Xi Jinping became China's new leader Thursday, assuming the top posts in the Communist Party and the powerful military . He and the six other men who will form China's new collective leadership, all dressed in dark suits, walked in line onto the red-carpeted stage. Xi's appointment as chairman of the military commission, announced by the state Xinhua News Agency, marked a break from the recent tradition of retiring leaders holding onto the post for a transitional period to extend their influence. It meant outgoing leader Hu Jintao would relinquish all positions of power, giving Xi broader leeway to consolidate his authority. No surprise: The once-a-decade leadership change was carefully choreographed. It became clear Xi would lead China five years ago . Hall of the People: The announcement was rubber stamped as the final day of the week-long congress drew to a close in the Great Hall of the People . Hello and goodbye: Li Keqiang, left, also is due to take over from Wen Jiabao, right, as premier . The once-a-decade leadership change . was carefully choreographed. It became clear Xi would lead China five . years ago, when he was appointed to the Standing Committee - the . nation's apex of power - as the highest-ranked member who would not be . of retirement age this year. Very little is known about Xi Jinping's upbringing - or his rise to power. He is married to a popstar called Peng Liyuan who, for most of Xi's career, has been more famous than him. Chinese often tell a well-known joke: 'Who is Xi Jinping? Why, he is the husband of Peng Liyuan.' He is the son of Communist revolutionary general Xi Zhongxun, a comrade of Chairman Mao. But when he was in his teens, his father fell out with the Chairman and was sent to prison. Xi . was exiled to a far-flung, rural community of Liangjiahe, in Shaanxi . province, where he lived in cave-dwellings and was forced to labour in . the fields. Little more than 100 miles from Beijing, it is one of China's poorest regions. The family lived like peasants in a cave-like house carved out of the yellow rock formations that surrounded the village. He is quoted as saying no problems he has encountered in political life compare to the hardship he suffered as a young man. After leaving Liangjiahe, Xi headed to the busy coastal provinces that form China's industrial heartland. He quickly climbed the ranks to become the most senior party official first in Fujian, before Zhejiang and finally Shanghai. There he developed the mind for business and economics that he is known for today. Now . with exports and the economy slowing, China hopes his skills can help . get the nation back on track to overtaking America and becoming the . biggest economy in the world. Xi's . colleagues in the new Standing Committee are Li Keqiang, the . presumptive premier and chief economic official; Vice Premier Zhang . Dejiang; Shanghai party secretary Yu Zhengsheng; propaganda chief Liu . Yunshan; Vice Premier Wang Qishan; and Tianjin party secretary Zhang . Gaoli. In a speech . broadcast live on Chinese state TV and worldwide, Xi said, 'We shall do . everything we can to live up to your trust and fulfill our mission.' 'There . are also many pressing problems within the party that need to be . resolved, particularly corruption,' Xi said. 'We must make every effort . to solve these problems. The whole party must stay on full alert.' The other six leaders were expressionless with their arms at their sides during Xi's 20-minute speech, then smiled to the audience when they walked off stage. The son of a party elder, and vice president for the past five years, Xi will lead the world's No. 2 economy and newest diplomatic and military power amid increasingly vocal calls for economic and political reform - including from within the 82-million-member party itself. At ease in front of people and with colleagues, Xi takes over the party leadership from the stiff, technocratic Hu, and is expected to assume the largely ceremonial presidency in March. The ascent of Xi and Li, the premier-in-waiting, represents a generational change. Though they spent their youths laboring on farms, their university years and early careers took place when China was casting off the planned economy and turning to the free market and to the West. They are thought to be more open to new ideas than their predecessors, but nonetheless bound by China's consensus-oriented politics. Thursday marked only the second tidy . transition since communist rule was established in 1949, despite a . turbulent political year that saw the downfall in a murder and . corruption scandal of rising populist Bo Xilai, who had been seen as a . key contender for the new leadership slate. The . outgoing Hu oversaw a decade of turgid economic growth and urban . development and tried to make concern for ordinary people the hallmark . of his tenure, but he also will be remembered for harshly stifling . dissent and rolling back civil liberties. At . the same time, increased social freedoms have created a generation of . Chinese who are more aware of their rights and more vocal about . demanding them.","Xi .
