"Lee Kuan Yew, the founding father of Singapore and the man widely credited with molding the island nation into one of the world's most prosperous countries, has been released from the hospital, where he was treated for an irregular heartbeat and ""stroke-like symptoms."" The 89-year-old Lee was resting at home, according to a statement from the office of his son, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong. Commonly referred to by his initials, LKY, the elder Lee was Singapore's first prime minister after it gained independence from Malaysia in 1965. His son is the third. Lee was admitted to Singapore General Hospital on Saturday after experiencing a suspected transient ischaemic attack, or a brief disruption of blood flow to a part of the brain, the statement said. A person generally has stroke-like symptoms during a TIA, but unlike a stroke, it may last only a few minutes and usually clears in less than 24 hours. A businessman at the time, Lee took over the helm of the swampy seaport of Singapore in 1959 and governed through the race riots of the 1960s. Transforming Singapore . He molded Singapore into a major transport and financial services hub, with its port becoming one of the busiest around the globe. But he also created a Singapore bound by stringent laws and regulations that dictated most, if not all, aspects of society -- including media and political freedoms, censorship and even the selling of chewing gum. He voluntarily stepped down in 1990, the first Southeast Asian strongman to do so, and turned power over to Goh Chok Tong. Goh ran a ""kinder, gentler Singapore"" and helped dilute the perceptions of a Lee family dynasty. After 14 years in power -- steering Singapore through the 1997 financial crisis and the SARS outbreak, and reaching out to his neighbors and to the West -- 63-year-old Goh turned the office over to Lee's son in 2004. Enduring legacy . Even after his departure from office, the elder Lee retained his influence around the world. ""This is one of the legendary figures of Asia in the 20th and 21st centuries,"" U.S. President Barack Obama said during a meeting with Lee at the White House in October 2009. ""He is somebody who helped to trigger the Asian economic miracle."" The next year, Time magazine listed Lee as one of the 100 people who most affected our world. ""The mark of a great leader is to take his society from where it is to where it has never been,"" wrote former U.S. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger in the magazine's entry for Lee. ""There is no better strategic thinker in the world today.""","Former Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew is resting at home, his son's office says .

"KABUL, Afghanistan (Reuters)  -- Former Afghan king, Mohammad Zahir Shah, died on Monday, aged 92, presidential palace sources said. Zahir Shah ruled Afghanistan from 1933 until he was deposed by his cousin in 1973. ""He died today in bed, we have no further information, but he had been sick for a month,"" a palace official told Reuters. Zahir Shah ruled Afghanistan from 1933 until he was deposed by his cousin in 1973. He lived in exile in Italy before returning home as an ordinary citizen in 2002. Zahir Shah came from a long line of ethnic Pashtun rulers and is a distant relative of Afghan President Hamid Karzai. The former king's reign is remembered as one of the most peaceful periods of Afghanistan's turbulent history. Born in Kabul on October 15, 1914, Zahir Shah received part of his education in France and returned to Kabul for military training. He ascended the throne in 1933 after his father was assassinated by a deranged student. For two decades, the bookish king remained in the shadows, allowing three uncles to run the government. But he gradually gained in confidence and took full control in 1953, overseeing a cautious modernization of his backward realm. He supported an end to purdah -- the wearing of the veil -- for women, used foreign cash to develop the country's medieval infrastructure and managed to keep a balance between rival Soviet and Western interests in his country. In 1973, while holidaying in Italy, Zahir Shah was ousted in a bloodless coup orchestrated by his cousin and brother-in-law, Prince Daoud, ending two centuries of rule by the Durrani dynasty. Daoud was later killed in a coup and after Soviet troops entered the country in 1979 to prop up the communist government, Afghanistan has barely seen peace.  E-mail to a friend .

"A spectacular Viking-themed festival kicking off in the Scottish Shetland Islands Tuesday has been stoked by controversy after two participants refused to shave off their beards. The men were preparing for the region's midwinter Up Helly Aa festival -- a highlight of the tourist calendar -- but their facial hair was judged incompatible with emergency breathing equipment they were obliged to don as fire fighters on their home island of Bressay. The pair's stance has thus deprived the tiny isle of a fire team until the festivities wind up, the Scotsman reports. The ""beard protest"" may testify to the significance of Up Helly Aa to the inhabitants of this remote group of islands strung out between the Scottish mainland and Norway. Or it may point to the importance of beard size to Shetlands men. Either way, it does seem risky to be without a fire crew amid a season of celebrations whose main event, taking place Tuesday in the Shetlands capital of Lerwick, is described by organizers as ""Europe's largest fire festival."" Pyromaniacal delights . The fiery festival includes a torch-lit procession through town and culminates in the burning of a replica Viking longship -- all broadcast live online. Up Helly Aa (it sounds best if you shout it) may commemorate the Shetlands' ancient Viking heritage -- hence the importance of big bushy beards -- but the festival itself began only a little more than a century ago. It's the continuation of an older and even more fun-sounding bit of midwinter revelry that involved young men dragging burning tar barrels through their village and generally causing mischief. When tar-barelling was banned, to the sound of much presumed Methodist tut-tutting, it was replaced in the 1880s by the tamer torch parades and other pieces of incendiary merriment that have continued to this day on the Shetlands, barring adjournments for the death of Queen Victoria and two world wars. A jarl and his guizers . As part of Tuesday's Lerwick celebrations, a procession of up to a thousand torch-bearing ""guisers"" in Viking fancy dress are led through town by a head ""jarl."" The party sets ablaze a mocked-up longship in what begs to be interpreted as an ambivalent  commemoration of the raping and pillaging Scandinavian contribution to the local gene pool. The jarl (it means ""nobelman"" in Old Norse; ""guiser"" means ""disguised person"" in Scots) sets the fashion tone for the parade with a costume handed down to his successor every year. Its original items, the Up Helly Aa website records, included ""a silver helmet, with raven's wings ... a corselet with sleeves of silver mail ... thigh-length black stockings and ... rawhide sandals fastened with tan leather thongs criss-crossed over the instep and all the way up the thighs."" One wonders what the Scottish equivalent of ""I'm a lumberjack"" is. The jarl's ""guiser squad"" make their own weapons -- and grow their own beards -- throughout the year, including battle axes, swords, spears and crossbows. Torch songs . They also do a lot of singing, with lines such as: . Worthy sons of Vikings make usTruth be our encircling fireShadowy visions backward take usTo the Sea-King's fun'ral pyre. No wonder authorities are worried about fire risks. To return to which subject, a Shetlands safety board member, Allison Duncan, described the Bressay firefighters' refusal to lose their bushy symbols of Norse manhood -- thus ""putting the safety of Bressay people at risk"" -- as ""crazy [and] mind-boggling."" The crewmen themselves, possibly too busy preparing their beards for the big day, could not be reached for comment.","Viking-themed fire festival kicks off in Shetland Islands .

"It had been an uneventful 10-plus hour flight from Seoul, South Korea, approaching San Francisco's airport on a clear summer day. Then, in a few horrifying seconds, that calm was shattered. A fireball erupted after the Boeing 777 airliner hit the runway hard around 11:30 a.m., rocked back and forth, spun around, shearing off the plane's tail. Scores of passengers and crew climbed out -- some jumping, others sliding down evacuation chutes as flames and smoke billowed from the aircraft's windows. Two people were found dead outside the plane, according to San Francisco fire Chief Joanne Hayes-White. ""My understanding is that they were found on the runway,"" she said. The airline identified the dead girls as students Wang Linjia and Ye Mengyuan, both 16. Somehow, 305 others survived. Said San Francisco Mayor Ed Lee: ""This could have been much worse."" Follow latest developments in the story . That's an understandable sentiment for anyone who heard passenger and eyewitness accounts, or saw the distressing, distorted images showing what remained of Asiana Airlines Flight 214. Some photos painted an almost otherworldly scene -- like one posted online by David Eun of passengers walking from the burning plane. Some dragged their carry-on bags. One man held his hands steady to snap a picture. ""I just crash landed at SFO,"" Eun wrote. ""Tail ripped off. Most everyone seems fine. I'm ok. Surreal..."" CNN iReporter Timothy Clark watched from an eighth-floor balcony of a nearby hotel. He recalled hearing a bang, seeing a ""dust cloud,"" then seeing ""people running from the plane, then flames."" Elliott Stone was one of them. He was ""10 seconds away from being home"" when the airplane dipped ""kind of sharp,"" followed by another adjustment ""and then just boom, the back end just hit and flies up in the air and everybody's head goes up to the ceiling."" The first announcement ""was everybody calm,"" Stone said, but he and others unbuckled anyway. He told CNN he jumped out a door, before slides had deployed and before first responders had arrived. When they did, they saw some people climbing out of San Francisco Bay around the airport, Hayes-White said. Video taken soon after the crash and posted on YouTube showed dark gray smoke rising from the plane, which was upright on its belly, with no landing gear evident. Its roof was charred and, in spots, gone entirely. The back of the plane appeared to have been lopped off entirely. 'I just crash landed at SFO. I'm ok. Surreal' Eunice Bird Rah provided CNN a photo shot by her father, showing flames and smoke bursting out of many of the aircraft's windows. Some 182 passengers and crew were being treated at Bay Area hospitals, with everything from spinal fractures to bumps and bruises, San Francisco deputy fire chief Dale Carnes said. Rah's father is one of the 123 people who escaped -- physically, at least -- uninjured, according to Carnes. He's ""doing fine, thank God,"" his daughter said. It's not lost on her how horrible the whole scene was and how much more horrible it could have been. ""It's heartbreaking,"" she said. No explanation yet on why this happened . Investigators from Washington and Seoul are heading to northern California trying to answer a simple question. How did this happen? While the exact cause will take months to determine, the South Korean Transport Ministry said ""the tail of the Asiana flight hit the runway and the aircraft veered to the left out of the runway."" Why this crash was survivable . Members of South Korea's Aviation and Railway Accident Investigation Board will travel to San Francisco, that agency said. They'll be joined by a ""go-to"" team from the United States' National Transportation Safety Board, led by chairman Deborah Hersman. Right now, they're not sure what they'll find, though a U.S. national security official has said there are no signs of terrorism. ""We have not determined what the focus of this investigation is yet,"" Hersman said. ""Everything is on the table at this point."" Watching from a nearby hotel, Anthony Castorani saw the plane touch the ground, then noticed a large plume of smoke. ""You heard a pop and you immediately saw a large, brief fireball that came from underneath the aircraft,"" he told CNN. Kristina Stapchuck saw the dramatic scene unfold from her seat on a plane on the airport's tarmac. Soon after Flight 214 touched down, ""it looked like the tires slipped a little bit and it rocked back,"" she told CNN. Parts of the plane began to break off as it rocked and then began to spin. ""It all happened so suddenly,"" Stapchuck told CNN. Flight data recorders recovered from Asiana crash . 'Serious moment to give thanks' Well after the crash, debris extended through a large swath of the airport -- right up the water's edge. But the recovery will go well beyond that. There were 16 crew members on the flight, in addition to 291 passengers, according to Asiana Airlines. The manifest included 141 Chinese passengers, 77 South Koreans and 61 Americans. Carnes said that 49 of those treated at area hospitals were in ""serious"" condition. Fifty-two of them are at San Francisco General Hospital, including five patients in critical condition, hospital spokeswoman Rachael Kagan said. Another 45 have been treated at a Stanford University hospital, some of them suffering from ""life-threatening injuries,"" said Dr. David Spain, the chief of trauma. ""Many are critically injured,"" Lee stated Saturday evening. The crisis Saturday had trickle-down effects as well. At one point, flights destined for San Francisco International Airport were diverted to airports in Oakland, Sacramento, San Jose and Los Angeles, said Francis Zamora of San Francisco's emergency management department. Expert on crash: Shouldn't have been close to hitting seawall . By 3:30 p.m., though, two of the San Francisco airport's four runways were open -- though the other two were still closed over eight hours later. The spotlight shone, too, on Asiana Airlines and the plane it received in 2006. One of South Korea's two major airlines, the other being Korean Air, it flies to 23 other countries. Many of the 25-year-old airline's flight go out of Incheon International Airport, which is the largest airport in South Korea and considered among the busiest in the world. What happened to the flight is one part of the story. But there are 307 more personal stories out there -- of people who were moments from wrapping up a long flight, but instead endured a nightmare. Some who weren't on board also have stories to tell -- whether they saw the horror from an aircraft, tried to track down family members, or counted their blessings in other ways. Sheryl Sandberg, Facebook's chief operating officer and author of the book ""Lean In,"" is in the latter category. She was supposed to be on Flight 214, but switched to a United flight, arriving about 20 minutes before the Asiana flight crashed. ""Serious moment to give thanks,"" she wrote on her own Facebook page.","""It could have been much worse,"" San Francisco's mayor says .

"""We were shouting for help, but nobody listened,"" said Muhammad Iqbal about the slaying of his pregnant 25-year-old wife, Farzana Parveen, at the hands of her relatives, who gathered to kill her in front of a courthouse in Lahore, Pakistan. More than 20 members of the woman's family stoned her to death for the ""crime"" of ""dishonoring"" her family by choosing to marry someone she loved rather than a husband her family had chosen.  A police officer said  ""one family member made a noose of rough cloth around her neck while her brothers smashed bricks into her skull."" Social media immediately picked up on the horrific and very public killing. #Farzana became a hashtag that provoked a conversation about the crime of so-called ""honor killings"" and society's tolerance and the police's alleged indifference to it.  Suddenly a crime that not long ago would barely have elicited a headline was now a source of conversation and consternation among those on social media both within and outside Pakistan.  And discussion about the slaying turned up another grim fact: Iqbal told CNN he killed his first wife so he could be free to propose to Farzana. The #Farzana hashtag comes on the public heels of another long-known and rarely noted issue that caught fire in the public's imagination and provoked a storm of well-deserved outrage: the kidnapping of schoolgirls in northern Nigeria by the militant group Boko Haram. A Nigerian lawyer created the #bringbackourgirls hashtag to call attention to the mass abduction of young women who gathered at school to take their exams. Once the word got out, people around the world began talking about the issue over social media.  Reporters and politicians rushed to follow their lead, and discussions about girls' education and the crimes of Boko Haram at last punctured public indifference. In America, another horrific crime unleashed a gush of online discourse.  This time it was a 22-year-old man on a quest for what he called his  ""day of retribution,"" when he would torture and kill ""good-looking people"" before launching a ""war on women"" to punish girls and women who he said had ""starved (him) of sex.""  The misogyny in the killer's more than 100-page diatribe led women to begin using the #Yesallwomen hashtag to push forward a conversation on Twitter and Facebook and Tumbler about the rarely discussed though frequently experienced issues of violence against women, from sexual assault to harassment to domestic brutality. The #Yesallwomen hashtag went global and began trending on Twitter. Once again the mainstream media picked it up from there and followed the lead of women who had had enough of crimes and abuses perpetrated against them to speak publicly on the toll they have taken on their lives. Yet, for all the hashtag consciousness-raising and social media meet-ups of the like-minded the question remains: Will what happens in cyberspace stay there? Or will online outrage lead to real world change? Will crimes committed against women and girls across the globe finally come to be seen as harming and hampering not just women, but the communities in which they live? Much could be done if online activism led to real-life campaigning for concrete progress, such as: . -- Enacting and enforcing laws to protect girls as young as 8 and 9 from being married against their will . -- Providing aid and incentives to keep girls in schools -- built near their homes -- and to combat traditions that keep them out of the classroom . -- Pushing for more stringent laws in the United States and abroad to punish traffickers rather than children . -- Highlighting as role models the many fathers and brothers who value their daughters and allow them to pursue their futures unfettered, sometimes at the risk of their own safety and standing in society . And these are only the start.  The hashtag activism and social media outrage is an important start to addressing issues to which the world for so long had remained indifferent.  But it is just one step. It falls to each of us to see whether all the talk about the power of women and girls and the shame of harming them translates into on-the-ground change.  The stakes are high -- for all of us.","In Pakistan, a pregnant woman who wanted to marry for love was killed by relatives .

"SeaWorld Parks & Entertainment is requesting the U.S. Department of Labor investigate the conduct of employee Lara Padgett, alleging she violated the ethics code for government employees. Padgett is an Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) agent who investigated SeaWorld for safety violations after the death of Dawn Brancheau, a veteran trainer killed by a 12,000-pound orca named Tilikum in 2010. As a result of some of Padgett's findings, OSHA determined SeaWorld violated the Occupational Safety and Health Act, saying it exposed its workers to a ""known hazard"" in the workplace. OSHA fined SeaWorld and restricted the interaction between trainers in the water with the killer whales, a decision that SeaWorld has appealed. In a 228-page complaint filed Thursday, SeaWorld said it has obtained information showing Padgett is biased against the aquatic park and accused her of engaging in cronyism with the producers of the documentary, ""Blackfish,"" produced by Magnolia Pictures and acquired by CNN Films last year. The film explores the concept of keeping killer whales in captivity for entertainment. It set off a national debate resulting in significant backlash for SeaWorld. SeaWorld has long called ""Blackfish"" one-sided and claimed it is the product of animal activists. A spokesman for the Department of Labor's inspector general said the office had received the complaint but could issue no further comment. Attempts to reach Padgett were not immediately successful Friday. Department of Labor spokesman Jesse Lawder said OSHA referred the matter to the inspector general in January, immediately after allegations first surfaced, and that the agency is awaiting the results of that investigation. In the complaint, SeaWorld alleges Padgett attended the 2013 Sundance Film Festival with ""Blackfish"" producers and accepted lodging free of charge. SeaWorld provided CNN with several purported photos of Padgett, lifted from what appear to be her personal social media accounts, showing the federal employee in various photos with the film's cast and crew -- including a picture of the group in a ""Charlie's Angels"" pose, complete with air guns, at the film's premiere in New York. The company also accused Padgett of disclosing confidential information. ""Blackfish"" associate producer Tim Zimmermann asked to borrow a witness' thumb drive and was subsequently seen working with Padgett on a laptop computer, the complaint says. The witness then found new documents related to OSHA's investigation on the drive after it was returned -- documents, the complaint states were clearly labeled as SeaWorld trade secrets. The complaint does not identify the witness. Zimmermann told CNN no confidential documents were shared with him. ""I have no idea what to make of these accusations,"" he said. ""Lara Padgett never shared documents with 'Blackfish.' There are no documents in the film."" What's more, Padgett was not invited to Sundance by the ""Blackfish"" crew, Zimmermann said. She stayed in the house where the crew stayed for a few nights due to a lodging shortage in the area, but she ""came on her own dime,"" he said. "" 'Blackfish' does not have any, did not use any confidential documents,"" Zimmermann said. ""We obviously knew who she was. We tried to interview her, but ... all of OSHA declined to participate."" He added, ""Any feelings she had on SeaWorld, it was on her own."" Government employees are prohibited from divulging trade secrets. They face imprisonment, fines or termination if found in violation. ""We believe that this conduct demonstrates that she was influenced by improper considerations, and failed to bring the appropriate objectivity, in the investigation of the death of whale trainer Dawn Brancheau,"" the complaint states. ""SeaWorld further believes that Ms. Padgett's disclosure of confidential information and other conduct reflect an intense bias and a desire to assist those in the animal rights community who have publicly, and for many years, demonstrated a desire to damage SeaWorld as a viable business.""","OSHA referred case after allegations first surfaced .

"Beau Willimon has learned a key characteristic to succeeding in both politics and entertainment: not revealing too much. The ""House of Cards"" creator, show runner and primary writer talks freely about his show, which concerns a powerful South Carolina congressman, Francis Underwood (Kevin Spacey), and his maneuvers to get his way in the conniving world of Washington. But ask Willimon something basic, such as the premiere date of the popular Netflix series' second season, and he offers an elegant ""no comment."" ""I can't give you that tidbit right now, unfortunately,"" the former campaign aide says in a phone interview with CNN, occasionally straining to be heard over the roar of military helicopters. But Willimon, 35, is willing to talk about plenty of other things: the show's Emmy nominations -- including best drama -- the value of power, the balance between idealism and cynicism and who some of his models are. The Oscar-nominated producer and playwright (his ""Farragut North"" was turned into the George Clooney film ""Ides of March"") talked to CNN last week. The following is an edited version of the interview. CNN: Were you surprised by the Emmy recognition? Beau Willimon: I always keep my expectations pretty low. I believed and I know everyone on our team believed we had done a good job and we were curious to see whether the television academy agreed, and we were thrilled when they did. That's the icing on the cake, and it tastes pretty good. Netflix joins the Emmy club . CNN: How much of your political experience has shaped ""House of Cards""? Willimon: My jobs on campaigns were pretty low on the totem pole -- I was an advance man. But a number of my friends, including my best friend, Jay Carson, who is a political consultant on the show, were in the upper tiers and really knew what was going on. (Also,) I built up a lot of relationships in D.C. and the political world in general, and I draw from that all the time. And when any of my friends aren't sure about something, they usually know the person who is. It's a rough-and-tumble game whenever power is involved -- people's ambitions, their desires, their competitive spirit will often push them to play outside the rules. It's dramatic, it's interesting, and I think it's something we can all identify with to a degree. CNN: Some rule-breaking on the show seems par for the course, and some might be beyond the pale. Willimon: Well, beyond the pale ethically for most people, sure. But not beyond the pale in terms of reality. That's an extreme version, but in the history of humanity, a lot of heads have rolled in order for people to ascend to the throne. CNN: What sources have you relied on? Willimon: Inspiration is drawn from books like (Robert Caro's LBJ biography and Jeremy Larner's ""Nobody Knows""), and other times it's talking to people who worked in that world. I really don't think it's a show about politics at all. It's a show about power. And that power is displayed in our love lives, or our work environments, the way we comport ourselves when randomness brushes up against us. CNN: Francis often says that he prefers power over money. Do you have any personal views on that, given the influence money has in D.C. nowadays? Willimon: There's certainly a lot of overlap, right? To a degree, money is a form of power. But I think the differentiation he's drawing is what the end goal is. For some people the end goal is money. And then you see people like Francis who don't deny the importance of money, but that's not the reason he gets up in the morning. Money is finite, it's limited by a number and what you can buy with it. Power has no limits if you're willing to go far enough in order to get as much of it as you can. CNN: I wanted good things to happen to certain characters. They didn't. I can be a cynic but I guess I want to be an idealist. Is the show cynical? Willimon: I don't consider myself to be a cynic nor the show to be cynical. In fact, Francis Underwood is an optimist. Where I think people mistake his optimism for cynicism is that he's unapologetically self-interested. He believes ideology is a form of weakness -- a form of cowardice. It hems you in in ways that don't allow you to be flexible. And inflexibility is anathema to progress. The problem with Washington right now is that people are too stuck to their ideology. When you have both parties who will not find ways to compromise, who won't meet in the middle, you have paralysis. It's the perversion of idealism. I think what Francis has done is liberate himself from belief systems altogether. He says, I've got people over here who think this, and people over there who think that. I'm going to find ways -- whether it's through persuasion or seduction or intimidation or blackmail, whatever my tactics are -- to make sure everyone moves forward. I think that's attractive to people. One of the comments we often get is people root for Francis because he actually gets things done. He makes an argument for the ends justifying the means. CNN: Have you gotten much reaction from the actual denizens of Washington? Willimon: Sure. A lot of people in Washington have watched the show and think it's one of the more authentic portrayals they've ever seen. We definitely push the limits of probability, but everything that happens on the show is more or less plausible. And we don't shy away from the nuts and bolts and nitty-gritty of what it takes to get things done. And sometimes it's ugly. CNN: I do find the sausage-making ugly. When I watch the show, and Francis talks about ""looking weak,"" I'd be the person he's talking about. Willimon: Francis is an extreme example because he says, I don't have ideals in the traditional sense. I think he sees an intransigent belief system as a form of cowardice because it dictates your behavior for you. You don't have to make hard choices, you don't have to come up with solutions, you don't have to compromise, you don't have to think outside the box. That's like a sanctioned form of impotence that has the appearance of strength, but not if you scratch the surface. CNN: Do you think that news media play too much of a role in making that impotence look strong, because they enjoy conflict? Willimon: That's an interesting question. I don't think that the media actually has the power to determine the course of history. What the media does is respond to narratives that are already coursing through the nation's system. Conflict always makes for a good story, and stories that interest people will always rise to the top of the headlines. But I just see that as a function of the media doing what it has always done since the first leaflet was printed -- trying to find its audience and keep them engaged. CNN: Does the binge-watching aspect affect the way you write it or make it? Willimon: It's sort of yes and no. When I first began season 1, we had not made a decision that we would release all 13 episodes at once. So I wrote it thinking it has to be able to work both ways. What affected the writing most was knowing we had two seasons guaranteed before I even started. I knew we had 26 hours, and there were things I could lay into the very beginning of season 1 that wouldn't boomerang back to the very end of season 2. So it's knowing you have such a large canvas to paint on. CNN: Is there any political figure or artistic figure you see as a model? Willimon: There are so many. In terms of political figures, someone we keep going back to for inspiration is LBJ. I don't necessarily say he's a model for me -- there are aspects of the way he conducted business that I find admirable and others I find abhorrent. (But) I think there's so much to be gained by digging into this life story. It's an epic American story that happens to be real. As far as models in the arts, one would be the screenwriter William Goldman, who's a friend and mentor of mine. The thing about Bill that's so extraordinary, besides the fact he's had a career that's spanned half a century, he continues to keep challenging himself. In a similar vein I would say Ken Burns. There you have someone who has such a singular vision and really stuck to it. The documentary world is a tough racket. The ability to make documentaries that are not only so epic and thorough and artful, but have them reach mainstream audiences -- I find it to be not short of miraculous. CNN: We saw bits of Frank's roots in the first season. Are we going to see more in season 2? Willimon: I wish I could tell you, but I'm not going to. You'll have to watch and see.","Netflix's ""House of Cards"" is up for nine Emmys .

"Cute and adorable or simply odd? The first of EVA Air's long range Hello Kitty jets completed its maiden flight to Los Angeles last week, drawing a litter of curious Kitty enthusiasts. Whatever your taste -- and judging by the comments below on this updated story, Kitty is more than quite palatable -- the flight marks something of a big step in brand extension for Sanrio's famed cat. Hello Kitty and her mates are hugely popular the world over, nowhere more so than in Asia where Taiwanese airline EVA Air flies five Kitty-themed planes in a tie-up with Sanrio. This adds to Kitty being on everything from restaurants to toasters (where Kitty's face is burned into your bread) to beer pong tables. Naturally. Sticking her on a metal tube and taking her to the United States and back is a braver move -- thrice-weekly flights from Taipei to Los Angeles began September 20. Europe is unlikely to be spared with a European schedule also reportedly on the cards. Each current Hello Kitty plane has a theme and for the Taipei-LAX flight, the new design features 19 Sanrio characters, including My Melody (Hello Kitty's BFF), Little Twin Stars' Kiki and Lala as well as rival character Kuromi, the trouble-making bunny.

"At the port in Lampedusa, recovery teams continue to fill trucks with the bodies they're still pulling from the sea. More than 300 so far -- and that number could rise. They are among the more than 500 African migrants believed to have been aboard a boat that sank off the island last Thursday. The tragedy amounted to Italy's deadliest migrant shipwreck and, according to Lampedusa Mayor Giusi Nicolini, ""the biggest sea tragedy in the Mediterranean Sea since World War II."" The survivors -- 155 of them, mainly from Eritrea, who swam for their lives and were lucky enough to be rescued by fishermen and the Coast Guard -- wait in a cramped migrant detention center. It was built to hold about 250 people but has held many times that in recent days. Each day, more people are leaving on ferries for other detention centers along the Italian coast, though 900 nonetheless remained Tuesday. Opinion: Europe must be open to refugees fleeing persecution . The traumatic firsthand accounts are helping build a picture of why the boat ended up on the seabed of the Mediterranean with most of its passengers entombed below deck. One of them, 30-year-old Germani Nagassi, told CNN he'll never forget what he saw. ""For five hours we were floating, using the dead bodies of our companions,"" he said. ""There is nothing worse than this. There were many children. There was a mother with her four children, a mother with an infant, all lost at sea. My mind is scarred and in a terrible condition."" Survivors mourn victims of Italy shipwreck . Perilous journey, then 13 days at sea . The voyage to Lampedusa was supposed to be one of the migrant's last on a long, sometimes painful journey to a new life. Take a woman named Santa, who asked not to use her family name, for fear of retaliation against her family back home in Eritrea. The single mother of a 4-year-old boy felt she had to escape the coastal east African nation, where she had no money for food or medical care. It was not done on a whim, especially given smugglers' demands. ""Our relatives and friends sold all that they had -- some little gold jewels, a piece of land or their house -- to sponsor our trip,"" Santa said. That trek took her across Africa -- jammed tight in jeeps crossing the Sahara Desert with only a few biscuits and juice to sustain them, packed in garages, occasionally beaten with a plastic water pipe if they talked or raised their eyes, she recalled. Santa and others' hope was simple: to have a better life. But the boat's sinking first threatened her life, and now that she's in Italian custody, her future. ""It's absurd,"" she said. ""We come here, we work to pay our families back -- if we don't die."" She and others spent 13 days at sea before their boat's engine stopped less than a mile from Lampedusa, Italy's closest island to Africa about halfway between Sicily and Tunisia. It's a common destination for refugees seeking to enter European Union countries, and a common site of shipwrecks. Lampedusa: Why tough penalties will not work . Fire on board . There's been criticism that more was not done to help, that the Italian coast guard was too slow to respond, that they spent precious time filming footage of the rescue instead of saving more lives. Hamid Mohammad, 18, swears an Italian vessel spotted them in trouble off the coast, but did nothing. ""The Italian's boat started circling around us. They circled our boat twice, then just went away,"" he said. ""That's when people started to panic."" The boat's captain told the passengers to set fire to clothes and blankets to attract attention. ""He gathered some clothes and bed sheets and lit them. But his container of benzene exploded,"" Mohammad said. The fire then spread, and when many of the migrants crowded to one side, the boat capsized, said Italian lawmaker Mario Marazziti, citing survivors' accounts. ""People were screaming as the boat capsized,"" Mohammed said. The lucky few . In response to criticism, the coast guard Saturday defended its response time and said its crews were on site 20 minutes after receiving the SOS call. ""The moment we got the emergency call from the fishermen at 7 a.m., we immediately intervened and started coordinating the rescue operations,"" said coast guard spokesman Filippo Marini. Abrahalli Amare, 23, was one of the lucky few who were eventually rescued. ""We left our country because of hardship, so that we could live in peace and help our families,"" Amare said.""But we have found this bitter sadness. It was so unexpected, so disturbing. And now we can't think of anything else."" In July: Pope prays for lost refugees on Lampedusa .","""We come here... to pay our families back if we don't die,"" survivor says .

"He had been guarding the U.S. Embassy in Ankara, as he'd done many other days -- with commitment and professionalism. She had gone there to have tea with the ambassador, a respected television journalist set to renew acquaintances with a diplomat and do her job. Then came the blast. Whether or not they'd crossed paths before, these two people's stories now forever will be intertwined -- thanks to a man Turkish authorities say belonged to the Marxist Leninist organization known as the Revolutionary People's Liberation Party, or DHKP-C, which the U.S. government and others label a terrorist organization. What is the DHKP-C? Ecevit Sanli, as he was identified by Istanbul police, died after detonating his bomb near the embassy's Gate No. 2 around 1:15 p.m. (6:15 a.m. ET) Friday. So, too, did the Turkish guard -- described by U.S. Ambassador Francis Ricciardone as a ""hero,"" and identified by Turkey's semi-official Anadolu News Agency as Mustafa Akarsu. A photo showed the journalist being carried away on a stretcher, apparently bleeding. Rather than sitting with her for tea, Ricciardone visited the woman -- Didem Tuncay -- at Ankara's Numune Hospital, and afterward described her as ""one of the best."" While theories have been floated,  neither Turkish nor U.S. authorities have detailed why they think Sanli blew himself up. Prior to Friday, he was known to U.S. and other intelligence agencies, a U.S. law enforcement source told CNN. Whatever Sanli's rationale, the explosion spurred security clampdowns at diplomatic facilities in Turkey, plus messages of condolences and solidarity. Turkish Prime Minster Recep Tayyip Erdogan called it an attack ""against the peace and welfare of our country."" Yet the violence reverberated well beyond Turkey's borders, however, especially in the nation whose embassy was targeted. The spotlight on U.S. diplomatic installations was already intense after violence last September in Egypt, Tunisia and Libya, where Ambassador Christopher Stevens was one of four Americans killed in Benghazi. U.S. Rep. Ed Royce said Friday's explosion in Turkey served as ""yet another stark reminder of the constant terrorist threat against U.S. facilities, personnel and interests aboard."" ""Coming after Benghazi, it underscores the need for a comprehensive review of security at our diplomatic posts,"" said Royce, a California Republican and chairman of House Foreign Affairs Committee. 'He exploded at the guard' The bomber had first gone to the rear access of the embassy, then went to a checkpoint on the building's perimeter where IDs are checked, explained U.S. State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland. According to law enforcement sources working on the investigation, Sanli blew himself up on a walkway for embassy employees and their guests. ""He exploded at the guard,"" Nuland explained. The guard, Akarsu, on one side of the security barrier was killed. Two guards on the other side of the glass survived, said the State Department spokeswoman. The blast blew a hole in what appeared to be a building that is part of the compound's outer gate, images from CNN sister network CNN Turk showed. This was all part of a large complex that includes blast doors, reinforced windows and a series of metal detectors that visitors must navigate before reaching embassy offices. Are you there? Send us your photos and videos, but please stay safe . The attack stirred swift condemnations, as well as fresh security precautions. The U.S. Embassy in Ankara subsequently put out a statement telling Americans not to visit that facility or U.S. consulates in Istanbul or Adana ""until further notice."" Portions of Paris Avenue, where the targeted embassy is located, were shut down, according to Anadolu news. Germany and France, meanwhile, were among the countries who tightened their security in the wake of the blast. The U.S. ambassador said in a statement that he'd ""paid my respects to the family of the Turkish hero who stood guard for us every day."" Calling him ""well trained (and) committed to his job,"" Ricciardone praised the late guard as a ""good, excellent, professional guard"" who ""died defending the Turks and the Americans who work at the embassy."" The ambassador also talked about visiting Tuncay, whom he recalled was ""the first person to interview me when I arrived two years ago at NTV."" Having learned she'd recently left the Turkish network, Ricciardone said he invited her to tea. ""She serves her country by getting the truth to the Turkish people,"" the ambassador said. ""She, I think, is one of the best."" Not first brush with terror for Turkey, U.S. Friday's blast was hardly Turkey's first brush with terror. At the nexus of Europe and Asia, and with deep roots in the Muslim and Christian spheres, Turkey has long been a boiling pot -- and, occasionally, a target. In recent years, it has been site of many acts of political violence from groups such as leftist anarchists, Kurdish separatists, Islamists and al Qaeda. Hasan Selim Ozertem, a security expert at the International Strategic Research Organization in Ankara, said Friday's attack could be related to recent arrests of DHKP-C members. Since the beginning of January, 85 members of the group have been taken into custody, he said, adding that Turkish police have been closely focusing on the group over the past five years. The DHKP-C was established in the 1970s. Ozertem said that one plausible theory is the group is trying to send a message to Turkish authorities by attacking the U.S. Embassy because it is near the Turkish parliament building. DHKP-C has a track record as a ""subcontractor"" group for other militant outfits, and it is also believed to have relationships with states in the region such as Syria and Iran, Ozertem said. The group has a relationship with the PKK, the Kurdistan Workers Party, which has been at odds with Turkey's government for some time. Ozertem said the attack could be linked to negotiations between the PKK and Turkish government. Another possibility is that Syria or Iran could be involved, considering the recent deployment of Patriot missiles in Turkey as a defense against possible missiles from Syria. The explosion occurred as about 400 U.S. military personnel are moving Patriot missile defense equipment to a Turkish base as part of an effort to defend the country from possible attack from Syria. The first battery became operational last Saturday in the city of Adana, NATO said, and more equipment arrived Wednesday in the port city of Iskenderun. Erdogan, however, ruled out that Friday's attack had anything to do with Syria, according to an interview on the private Habertuk channel later reported by Andolu. Of course, this may have to do primarily with the United States itself -- independent of anything involving Turkey or its government. While the U.S. Embassy in Ankara has not seen this kind of incident in decades, in 2008 three police officers died in a shootout with assailants outside the U.S. Consulate in Istanbul. Three attackers died in the incident, which the U.S. ambassador at the time called ""an obvious act of terrorism."" One of the attackers in that incident was believed to have trained with al Qaeda in Pakistan's Waziristan region.

"(CNN) -- After 13 days of staying in campers, in trailers or with out-of-town relatives to escape a raging wildfire, the 200-plus residents of Nutrioso, Arizona, were allowed to go home Wednesday. The Wallow fire, raging in eastern Arizona and western New Mexico, has grown into the largest fire ever battled in Arizona, according to fire officials. As of Wednesday evening, it had burned 747 square miles -- 478,452 acres -- and was 29% contained, officials said. The blaze, centered in a sparsely populated national forest, is not the most destructive in terms of property. It has destroyed 32 homes and 36 outbuildings including sheds and barns, compared with the 468,000-acre Rodeo-Chediski fire, which claimed 465 homes. Crews are expecting higher winds and fire danger Thursday and Friday. Officials with an interagency team fighting the blaze lifted the evacuation order issued June 2 for Nutrioso, allowing those with identification showing that they live there to return to the town Wednesday. Leighayn Green returned with her husband and their 13-year-old daughter to their undamaged home in Nutrioso. They stayed in different communities -- at times with friends and once in lodging provided by a stranger. ""There is a kindness being extended back and forth between communities,"" Green said several hours after she was back home. Her husband, Tom Hollender, also a teacher, recalled grabbing clothing, photos, legal documents and computer hard drives when he had to leave their home June 2. Their only real loss was spoiled food in a freezer and refrigerator that were without power for about a week. Other homes were damaged or destroyed in Nutrioso, but Hollender did not know the number. From his house, the family can see intact homes, but the damaged forest is a mosaic of green and black, he said. ""The fire line around Nutrioso is a nice black,"" said Peter Frenzen, a spokesman for the Southwest Incident Management team, which is fighting the blaze. ""That's just testimony to the tremendous work going on around all the threatened communities."" The black on a map signifies that the fire has been stopped outside the town. ""I was totally surprised,"" Nutrioso evacuee Alan Miller told CNN affiliate KNXV after learning that the evacuation order had been lifted. ""I was sitting in my seat, squirming. I want to go out there now, but I can't do it until tomorrow."" The blaze has raged throughout the Apache-Sitgreaves National Forest since May 29. KNXV reported Tuesday night that fire investigators suspect that the blaze was started by a campfire. ""It looks like it was a campfire, and we've got a couple of people of interest that we're talking to right now,"" U.S. Forest Service spokesman Christopher Knopp told KNXV. The names of those people have not been released. Besides Wallow, the largest of the fires is the Horseshoe Two fire in southern Arizona, which started May 8. The blaze, which has scorched 184,198 acres, was 60% contained as of Wednesday afternoon. The Monument Fire, which spilled into Mexico, had damaged or destroyed 40 homes and 10 other structures, according to the Cochise County, Arizona, Sheriff's Office. Evacuations were ordered in some neighborhoods and other residents were told they may have to leave, the office said. The Wallow fire has drawn 4,656 firefighters from Arizona and across the country. The blaze is the largest fire currently active in the United States, according to Inciweb, an interagency fire information service. ""The great news on this incident is, we still have a total of seven injuries and they're all minor,"" Frenzen said late Tuesday. Jayson Coil, a manager with the incident response team, said forecast winds from the northwest could fan flames in areas that have been sheltered from the fire and push the blaze south. Conditions around Greer, Arizona, also continued to improve, with power restored to the area, Coil said. But it is unclear when residents of that community might be allowed home. The evacuated residents of Alpine are also waiting to hear when they can go home. They may get the order first. Regarding when the evacuation orders for Alpine and Greer might be lifted, ""We're talking a three-, four- or five-day time frame,"" Frenzen said. CNN's Samuel Gardner III and Phil Gast contributed to this report.","NEW: 50 structures damaged or lost to another fire .

"Jennifer Nettles, half of the country music duo Sugarland, said she was never asked to delay the band's show at the Indiana State Fair because of an approaching storm. She would have complied if asked, Nettles said, according to testimony given during a taped deposition. Seven people died and more than 40 were injured last year when a storm caused a stage at the state fair to collapse, shortly before Sugarland was to perform. Several families of victims from the August incident have filed a lawsuit against the country band, contending it was negligent. Don Asher, general manager for a law firm that represents some of those victims, released clips of Nettles' deposition to the media Monday. It was taped Thursday in Charleston, West Virginia. ""We're invited to come into a place and play. It's not our place,"" Nettles said. ""I don't feel it's my responsibility, or my management's responsibility, to evacuate the fans in the case of danger. Do I care about their safety? Absolutely."" She said she was not asked to postpone show and would have complied if she had been approached. Furthermore, Nettles said she did not know whether Sugarland tour manager Helen Rollins prevented a delay or not, and was unaware of conversations that allegedly occurred about a possible postponement. In an affidavit from a lawsuit against one company, the fair's executive director says she twice sent the show's promoter to talk to Sugarland in an effort to delay the show. Twice the answer came back -- we want to go on, according to the deposition by Cynthia Hoye, the executive director of the state fair, according to the court filing. But in a separate document contained in a state report on the incident, Sugarland's Rollins said no one asked the band to delay its set. When asked why his firm chose to release the clips, Asher said: ""In our opinion the deposition tells a different story than the one being portrayed by Nettles' attorneys. They (Sugarland) could have delayed the start of the concert or sought to cancel it. They had access to Doppler radar and were aware of the storm approaching. In our opinion they (Sugarland) bear ultimate responsibility."" The firm is also considering releasing video of the deposition of Kristian Bush, the other half of the country music duo. Sugarland spokesman Allan Mayer responded: ""We're not sure what these lawyers think they're accomplishing by leaking selectively edited portions of the transcripts, but we don't think it's fooling anyone -- and it sure isn't bringing any truth or clarity to last summer's tragedy. ""Their self-serving assertions about what Sugarland knew or could have done are contradicted not only by Kristian and Jennifer's complete testimony but also by the independent reports of the Indiana Occupational Safety and Health Administration and the investigators hired by the state,"" he said in a statement. In February, the Indiana Department of Labor announced penalties totaling $80,800 following a worker safety investigation into the collapse. The largest fines -- totaling $63,000 for what the agency said were three violations -- were levied on Mid-America Sound Corp., which built the stage structure and leased it to the fair. Metal scaffolding supporting the stage lights fell onto a crowd of fans and workers as a storm swept through the Indianapolis fairgrounds on August 13, 2011, right before Sugarland was to perform.","Lead singer says she was never asked to delay the show .

"Five people arrested in the public stoning death of a pregnant Pakistani woman will be taken to an anti-terrorism court, authorities said. Farzana Parveen, 25, was killed in Lahore because she married a man against her family's wishes. Police arrested her father, her uncle, two cousins and the driver who brought them to Lahore, said Zulfikar Hameed, the lead investigator in the case. The court is treating the act as an act of terror that has  ""wider consequences on the safety and well being of all of society,"" according to lawyer Maliha Zia, who works for Aurat Foundation, a Pakistani women's rights organization. She said she was worried that international pressure may have forced the government to convene an anti-terrorist court in an act of ""show and tell."" ""I hope that the quality of the trial does not go down if it's sped up,"" she said. ""The investigation does not suffer and the trial does not suffer because of the shortened time period. What I'm hoping for is a better quality trial."" Pakistani police officers will be investigated because they didn't intervene when Parveen was publicly beaten to death with bricks, a court official said. Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif on Friday called the killing ""totally unacceptable"" and said it's a ""great shame"" for such a crime to happen in the presence of police. About 20 people, including members of Parveen's immediate family, attacked her with bricks Tuesday outside a court building in Lahore, police said. Such killings not uncommon . Such killings often originate from tribal traditions in Pakistan but are not a part of Islam. They usually happen in rural areas, not large cities such as Lahore. Human rights activists said bystanders, including police, often don't intervene because the killings are considered family matters. The Human Rights Commission of Pakistan said 869 women were victims last year (PDF) in the nation of about 180 million people. They are sometimes called honor killings because the women are accused of bringing dishonor upon the family by having an adulterous affair, being raped or wearing clothes considered revealing. Women's rights advocates say the actual number may be much higher. The United Nations estimates that at least 5,000 women worldwide die yearly in such killings. The prevalence of violence against women in Pakistan became apparent Thursday when Parveen's husband, Mohammad Iqbal, revealed to CNN that he killed his first wife six years ago so he could marry Parveen. His son said Iqbal served a year in jail. Iqbal, a neighbor of Parveen's family, said he and Parveen were supposed to marry with the family's approval last year. In December, her father and brothers decided Parveen, who came from a village in Punjab, should instead marry a cousin, police said. Opinion: How stoning of a woman riled the world . Bride's family infuriated . Parveen and Iqbal eloped and were married January 7 in a court ceremony. But Iqbal told GEO TV that Parveen's family was infuriated and filed a kidnapping case against him and other members of his family. They also demanded 100,000 rupees (about $1,000), he said. The couple went into hiding and filed statements in court to prove the kidnapping allegations false, Iqbal said. On Tuesday morning, they were scheduled to appear before a judge when Parveen's family allegedly attacked outside the court building. ""We went to the court to seek justice to tell them what had happened. We were sitting there when all of a sudden they appeared,"" he told GEO TV. ""Someone fired shots in the air. My wife and I were sitting, and then bricks were thrown. Then a lady came and took Farzana away."" Police stood and watched and didn't come to their aid, Iqbal said. He said the crowd killed his wife and her fetus. In addition to the prime minister, other officials rushed to denounce the killing. The chief minister of Punjab, Shahbaz Sharif, gave a 24-hour ultimatum to the inspector general to arrest the suspects. He asked that a murder trial be held in an anti-terrorism court. Britsh Foreign Secretary William Hague said, ""There is absolutely no honor in honor killings, and I urge the government of Pakistan to do all in its power to eradicate this barbaric practice.""

"Russia test-fired a ballistic missile Wednesday, a move that comes amid tensions about a recent NATO announcement that it placed an interim missile defense shield in Europe. The intercontinental missile was launched Wednesday morning from the Plesetsk Cosmodrome in northwestern Russia, the state-run RIA Novosti news agency reported. ""The new intercontinental ballistic missile is intended to strengthen the capabilities of Russia's Strategic Missile Forces, including its capabilities for overcoming anti-missile defenses,"" Defense Ministry spokesman Vadim Koval  told RIA Novosti. The launch comes days after NATO's chief said the alliance now has an interim ballistic missile defense capability in Europe. Among the interim capabilities are missile interceptors loaded on a U.S. ship in the Mediterranean, the first of four anticipated warships with the defense system. A defense radar is also operational in Turkey. The interim system will link the allies' missile defense systems -- satellites, ships, radars and interceptors -- under NATO control from a U.S. base in Ramstein, Germany. NATO has asked Russia to participate in the system, but negotiations have been deadlocked over Russia's demand for a legally binding treaty guaranteeing the shield would not be used as a deterrent to Moscow's own systems. Late last year, then-Russian President Dmitry Medvedev threatened to withdraw from the START treaty on nuclear weapons reductions and deploy ballistic missiles in its enclave of Kaliningrad on its border with Europe, if NATO moved ahead with the plans for missile defense. Tensions further increased in December, when Russia's ambassador to NATO suggested that Moscow would close transit routes that send vital supplies to troops in Afghanistan.","The intercontinental missile was launched Wednesday morning .

"It's an iconic piece of video. For more than three minutes, a mob of enraged men toss Moammar Gadhafi around like a broken mannequin. His body and face bloody, his black bushy hair a crazy mess, the 69-year-old Libyan leader is pummeled. His shirt is ripped open to reveal a pudgy belly. The cell phone camera then focuses on a gulf of red spreading across Gadhafi's backside as someone stabs him in the rear with a bayonet. Later, a young man holds a golden pistol triumphantly in the air as he's cheered by the mob in Sirte, Libya. It didn't take long before the video was uploaded to the Internet, where the world watched the violent end to Libya's eight-month uprising in 2011 -- and to Gadhafi's life. To critics of the long-ruling dictator, it appeared to be a fitting conclusion.  But human rights investigators now say there's much more to what happened on October 20 last year than rebels acting in the heat of the moment. Human Rights Watch says the militiamen who ravaged Gadhafi also captured, tortured and killed dozens of his loyalists following his death, violating international war crimes laws. That assertion is laid out in a 50-page report released by HRW this week.   The rights group based its findings on witness accounts and amateur videos shot with cell phones. In its report, HRW lambastes Libya's current transitional government, saying it has taken no serious steps in investigating or prosecuting anti-Gadhafi militias.  It also says its findings do not match Libya's assertion that Gadhafi was killed in the crossfire, and not after his capture. HRW called on Libya's leaders to honor their pledge formally and investigate Gadhafi's death. CNN has reached out to Libyan authorities for comment on the Human Rights Watch report, but has not received a response. If Libya is going to truly rid itself of violence and extremists -- a timely demand considering last month's fatal U.S. consulate attack -- justice, the group believes, must be meted out on all sides. Gadhafi and crew run . In February 2011, protesters took to the streets in Libya demanding peacefully that Gadhafi step down. His 42 years of hardline rule had to end, they said. A man who rarely embraced reality, Gadhafi retorted, ""All my people...love me."" As rallies continued, Gadhafi responded by ordering his forces to fire into the crowds. The movement descended into a violent uprising that dragged on for months. By March, the opposition gained a foothold in the city of Benghazi. In response, Gadhafi's forces closed in on the city. At the United Nations, the Security Council passed a resolution imposing a no-fly zone over Libya and authorized the use of ""all necessary measures"" -- except an occupation -- to protect civilians from the violence raging in their country. In August, as Tripoli looked ever more fragile, Gadhafi, his crew and his sons jumped into cars and sped off in various directions. Khamis Gadhafi, active in his father's regime, was killed in a NATO airstrike as he tried to skip town. Another son, Saif al-Islam, managed to make his way to the Misrata suburb of Bani Walid, surrounded by desert. Al-Islam later told Human Rights Watch that a NATO airstrike had left him mildly wounded. He was captured in November near Libya's border. National security adviser Mutassim Gadhafi, another son, made it safely to Sirte, his father's hometown. That's also where the dictator and his crew headed. Senior security adviser Mansour Dhao was in tow, he told Human Rights Watch, as well as Gadhafi's personal guard, driver and a bunch of other bodyguards. Libya's intelligence chief was there, but only briefly, because he was dispatched hundreds of miles to the south of Sirte. His job? He had to tell Khamis' mother that her son was dead. From luxury to squatting . For some time, Gadhafi and his inner circle stayed in the middle of the city. But as the fighting intensified, they began moving from empty house to empty house, eating the food left in the cupboards, Dhao said. The homes they sought shelter in had already been looted.  As the weeks wore on, food was sparse. The medicine they had was running out. It was getting tougher to find water. This group, who once dined in luxury, was subsisting on pasta and rice. ""Living (was) very hard... we didn't even have bread,"" Dhao recounted. Gadhafi spent most of his time reading the Quran and praying. ""His communications with the world was cut off... no television, nothing,"" Dhao said. ""No news. Maybe we could use the (satellite phone) and get some news from al-Rai, Russia Today, BBC or France 24. I mean, (we) could call people who watch those channels. ""We had no duties,"" he said. ""We were just between sleeping and being awake."" The militias hunting Gadhafi were getting closer. And the dictator was getting moodier. ""(He was) becoming more and more angry,"" Dhao said. ""Mostly he was angry about the lack of electricity, communications, and television, his inability to communicate with the outside world."" The men would sit with Gadhafi and try to calm him down. ""Why is there no electricity?"" he screamed at them. ""Why is there no water?"" A doomed escape . By mid-October, Mutassim, one of the two surviving sons, decided enough was enough. He told the group in Sirte to meet at an ad-hoc clinic. They were going to try to escape. The plan was to break out around 3:30 or 4 a.m. But it took until about 8 a.m. to load the supplies and the men who were wounded. By that time, anti-Gadhafi militia fighters had returned to their fighting positions. Odds were stacked against the convoy, not least of all because it was unwieldy, including some 250 people. When it set out, it came under heavy attack. It swerved and snaked onto dirt roads. A missile struck so close to the convoy that airbags in some of the vehicles inflated, Dhao said. Disoriented and out of options, Gadhafi's men drove right into a militia base. As NATO jets flew overhead, the vehicles were trapped. Munitions inside the convoy were triggered by the firepower all around. Explosions shook Gadhafi's crew from the convoy and they ran for their lives. Younis Abu Bakr Younis, the son of Gadhafi's defense minister, was among several who ran to a villa and took cover. When he got there, he saw Gadhafi hiding, wearing a helmet and bulletproof vest. The dictator had a handgun in his pocket and was carrying an automatic weapon, Younis and another witness told Human Rights Watch. Shots picked away at the concrete. Mutassim Gadhafi was injured but he still called the shots. He ordered the men to make a run for it, and motioned toward a drainage pipe near a main road several hundred feet away. Mutassim turned to his father. ""I will try and find you a way out of here,"" he promised. Once they made it to the pipe, fighters ran toward the group. Gadhafi's guard threw a grenade at them. It bounced off the concrete and back at them. The mob descends . Shrapnel sliced Gadhafi. Dhao saw that the leader's head was bleeding. But he was more concerned with his father, who was also with the group. He'd fallen to the ground. ""I ran towards my father, but he didn't answer when I asked him if he was okay,"" Dhao told Human Rights Watch. Younis, the son of Gadhafi's defense minister, was fatally injured. A guard was dead. Exposed, the group was overrun by militia fighters. The 3-minute, 38-second cell phone clip that seems to show the last moments of Moammar Gadhafi's life is choppy. Whoever was filming moves the camera around dizzily in the chaos. But the audio is clear. The mob shouts ""Allahu Akbar!"" or ""God is the greatest!"" They chant ""Misrata,"" the name of the town where hatred of Gadhafi burned most intensely during the uprising, primarily because his army had shelled it nonstop for two months in the spring. To understand precisely what shelling means here, imagine the kind of Fourth of July firework that shoots up to the sky in a single rocket and then bursts into a thousand pieces in the sky. If you were on the ground in Misrata, it was like that, only in reverse, a thousand tiny death pellets careening in all directions at speeds impossible to run from. Scores of innocent people were killed there, and even if they survived the shelling, there wasn't much hope. It was next to impossible to get medical aid, food and other supplies there. It was the militias of Misrata that brutalized Gadhafi loyalists the worst, the rights group says. The group also alleges it has evidence that indicates opposition militias took Mutassim from Sirte to Misrata and killed him, and it has cell phone video taken by opposition fighters showing captured convoy members being abused, the group said in its report. Human Rights Watch matched morgue pictures with video of men executed together in a hotel. HRW had investigators inside Libya the day Gadhafi died. The team documented more than 100 bodies and wrote in the Wednesday report that the bodies lingered for a while but were later buried by volunteers. The rights group alleges that no Libyan investigators have attempted to document how many people died, who killed them and how. The problem, Human Rights Watch says, is twofold. First, those militias from Misrata are still quite active. Today, they are preventing about 30,000 people from returning to their homes in the area, for example. Second, the country's transitional government perceives them as undermining governmental authority, the rights group said. Suspicion -- rather than order and forgiveness -- continues to grip Libya, the rights group suggests, and justice is being ignored.","Human Rights Watch: Libya should investigate rebels who killed Gadhafi forces .

"More than 1.7 million children in conflict-torn areas of eastern Ukraine face an ""extremely serious"" situation, the U.N. children's agency has warned, with their suffering exacerbated by harsh winter weather. Many families have been forced from their homes and lack access to safe water, sanitation and schooling. ""Children continue to bear the brunt of this conflict, with schooling disrupted and access to basic services limited,"" said Marie-Pierre Poirier, Unicef regional director for Central and Eastern Europe and Central Asia. She called for extra resources to be provided to those in need. ""Extremely harsh winter conditions have made the impact of the crisis more acute,"" she said. Government forces and pro-Russia rebels have been battling for control of eastern Donetsk and Luhansk regions since April, after Russia annexed Ukraine's southeastern Crimea region the previous month. According to a Unicef press release Friday, 147 schools have been closed in parts of the Donetsk region where fighting is ongoing, disrupting the education of about 50,000 children since September 1. While some schools are in ruins, others are closed because of safety concerns. In government-controlled areas, 187 educational institutions in total have been damaged or destroyed, Unicef said. The closures mean that besides lessons, children are missing out on the stability and routine that can be provided by school at a time of crisis, helping to alleviate their stress, the agency said. More than 1 million displaced . It's not just those still living in conflict areas who are affected. Since March, more than 1 million people have been displaced by the fighting, including nearly 530,000 within Ukraine. Of those, at least 130,000 are children, according to Unicef. In many cases they are not attending a new school because their parents have not registered them, anticipating further displacement or planning to return home. Unicef says it needs $32.4 million to meet the urgent humanitarian needs of 600,000 children and their families in Ukraine. The funds would help provide access to schooling; enable support to reduce children's high levels of stress; pay for polio vaccines; and ensure 250,000 children and women get safe water and hygiene supplies to prevent outbreaks of disease. The agency has received $9.4 million in funding and pledges to date. Amid the fighting, at least 44 children have been killed in Ukraine this year, according to the agency. Pressure on Moscow . While Ukraine's civilian population suffers, there is little sign of progress in reaching a diplomatic resolution to the crisis. Western powers accuse Russia of sending troops and equipment to help the separatists in their fight against Ukrainian government forces and have imposed repeated rounds of economic sanctions against Russian interests in a bid to put pressure on Moscow. But President Vladimir Putin appears to have little appetite to repair relations with the West, despite his country's tanking economy. Putin told reporters gathered in Moscow on Thursday that his country was ready to mediate in the Ukraine crisis. He also denied that Russians killed in Ukraine were members of his country's military, repeating the long-standing Russian line that any Russians fighting in Ukraine were volunteers. A ceasefire deal was reached September 5 in Minsk, Belarus, after talks between representatives of Ukraine's government, Russia and rebel leaders in eastern Ukraine. A subsequent agreement on September 19 in Minsk set out more measures. But fighting in Ukraine has since resumed, with a British security official last month telling CNN that the conflict had returned to levels that preceded the ceasefire. Military spokesman Andriy Lysenko said during a televised briefing Friday that five Ukrainian soldiers had been killed and seven wounded in the past 24 hours. Militants, including snipers, fired on Ukrainian positions using rifles and small arms, said Lysenko.","Unicef: More than 1.7 million children in Ukraine face ""extremely serious"" situation .

"Some years ago, I appeared on a well-known television talk show opposite four ""angry white men"": four men who believed they had been discriminated against in the workplace by affirmative action programs initiated, they argued, by feminist women. Each man told his story of how he was qualified for a job or qualified for a promotion that he did not get because of this putative reverse discrimination against white men. One ended his remarks with a line that served as the title for this show: ""A black woman stole my job,"" he declared. Asked to respond, I had but one question for these guys, a question about the title of the show.  Actually, my question was about one word in the title of the show. I wanted to know about the word ""my.""  Why did the men think it was their job?  Why wasn't the title of the show ""A black woman got a job"" or ""A black woman got the job""?  The answer, I argued, was that these men felt entitled to the position, and that any effort to make the workplace more equal was perceived, by those men, as a loss. I thought of those men recently while reading Suzanne Venker's addled rant against feminist women as the source of the unhappiness that saturates male-female relationships. I thought of how painful it is when you are used to having everything to now have only 80%. What a loss!  Poor us!  Equality sucks when you've been on top -- and men have been on top for so long that we think it's a level playing field. In her screed against women, she argues that women are their own worst enemy, and that the rise of women has caused the ""end of men,"" that men are wilting into angry, resentful bachelorhood because women are demanding so much from men.  They're emasculating men, confounding their DNA, which seeks only to provide and protect.  Women aren't letting men be men. Women, Venker writes, have been seduced by feminists into pushing men off their pedestal to ""take what they were taught to believe was rightfully theirs."" As a result, Venker continues, women have come to believe the adage ""women good/men bad"" -- an equation that has ""destroyed the relationship between the sexes.""  Men, she tells us, are ""tired of being told that if women aren't happy, it's men's fault."" But she is actually arguing that if men aren't happy, it's women's fault -- for seeking the very same exhilarating sense of autonomy and selfhood that men claim as our natural entitled birthright. How dare they? OK, so what's wrong with this picture? This unhinged argument fuses dreadful history with empirically baseless contemporary analysis. The result cannot help but be bad politics. This notion of good women/bad men has been the foundation not of feminism but of anti-feminism since the 19th century. Those innocent ""angels in the house"" were supposed to soothe the savage beast, as men were prone to bouts of rage, drunkenness and other depravities. If women didn't tame men, the anti-feminists argued, all hell would break loose. Pop psychologists joined the pundits to argue, as does Venker, that if women are unhappy, it's their own damned fault. How many advice columns about ""the rules,"" admonitions about the man shortage or effusive media prostration before three or four upper-class white female Yale grads who ""opted out"" (only to rejoin the workforce when their children were 5 years old) must we endure? Countless. One needn't be original to be wrong. In fact, feminism reversed the equation Venker offers. It encouraged women to be bad girls -- to seek their own pleasures, to go for it, autonomously, to leave unhappy marriages, and to control their own bodies.  And it encouraged men to be good -- demanded it, in fact -- insisting that men can and should step up as equal parents, colleagues and coworkers, that we stop the rape and violence that so compromised women's equality. And the empirical evidence suggests that men are quietly adapting to a very new landscape.  Most of the 400 young men (aged 16-26) who I interviewed for my book ""Guyland"" assume, without resentment, that their wives will be as fully committed to their careers as they are. Why?  Because they'll need the income.  And they assume, with no resentment, that they will be involved fathers, spending far more time with their families than their parents or grandparents ever did.  Why?  Because they actually want to be involved dads. They all have friends of the opposite sex (""When Harry Met Sally's"" dictum to the contrary), which bodes well for their ability to be more equal coworkers and colleagues with women they consider their peers. Stop the madness. There's no war between the sexes. Men and women can, and should, be allies.  And they are becoming more equal, and happier, every single day. Men aren't nearly as unhappy or resentful as Venker suggests -- because she only talks to those who feel themselves so entitled that they lament, as did Rush Limbaugh, that the re-election of President Obama was the loss of ""our country."" Truth is, in her efforts to exalt men, she actually insults us. Who says we can't be happy with fully equal female colleagues and coworkers?  Who says we can't enjoy the joys of shared parenthood?  Who says that we are biologically programmed to be both rapacious testosterone-driven animals and lazy remote-hogging couch potatoes unable to lift a finger in the kitchen? Venker paints a most unyieldlingly awful portrait of men, one that is happily belied by actual, real, American men.  And we won't stand for the sort of male-bashing Venker offers.  We want it all also -- and the only way we can have it all is to halve it all.

"Washington (CNN) -- Several police officials and politicians are pointing fingers at New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio after two New York City police officers were murdered on Saturday, following weeks of protests against police treatment of minorities in New York and around the country. And one is pulling the President of the United States into the fray. The head of New York City's police union said de Blasio has blood on his hands, and the state's former Republican governor called out de Blasio and U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder. Former New York City mayor and one-time Republican presidential candidate Rudy Giuliani appeared to sympathize with de Blasio on Sunday, instead dragging in President Barack Obama. ""We've had four months of propaganda starting with the President, that everybody should hate the police. I don't care how you want to describe it, that's what those protests are all about,"" Giuliani said Sunday on Fox News. Giuliani added on CNN that while none were responsible for the shooting, de Blasio, Holder and Obama are fueling ""intense, anti-police hatred."" ""Maybe, just maybe, they should spend the next four months not talking about police hatred, but talking about what they are going to do about bringing down crime in the community,"" he said, adding that it's police officers and not Obama, Holder or any mayors who are saving lives. Protests broke out around the country in the wake of two separate cases in which grand juries declined to charge white police officers in the killing of two unarmed black men, Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, and Eric Garner, in New York City. Obama has sympathized with protesters' frustrations, drawing on his own experiences as a black man, and urged protesters to express themselves peacefully. Former Gov. George Pataki blamed de Blasio and Holder. And the head of NYPD's police union, Patrick Lynch, pointed the finger at de Blasio, saying there's blood on the hands of those supporting the protestors and it ""starts on the steps of city hall in the office of the mayor."" Giuliani also condemned Rev. Al Sharpton, one of the main organizers and supporters of the protest movement, for creating an atmosphere of ""strong anti-police hatred in certain communities."" ""And for that they should be ashamed of themselves,"" Giuliani said. Sharpton strongly condemned the attacks on Sunday. Giuliani said asking for de Blasio's resignation and blaming him for the killings of the two NYPD officers ""goes too far,"" but said de Blasio should be more forceful in policing the protests that have on several occasions taken over major streets in New York City. Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina made his position clear on CBS Sunday morning as the blame game evolved. ""I blame the shooter and nobody else,"" he said. ""The tone they're setting around the rhetoric regarding the cops incites crazy people. But I blame the shooter."" Mayor Bill de Blasio condemned the killings on Saturday night, calling the double-murder a ""heinous attack"" that ""was an attack on our entire city,"" which he said ""tears at the foundation of our society."" Rep. Gregory Meeks, a Democrat who represents parts of New York City, lauded those comments and said de Blasio and protest leaders have tried to ""bring people together"" to discuss minority communities' concerns about the criminal justice system. ""We stand with the police department. No one has ever given up on the police department or said we were anti-police department. What we were crying for was saying how African-Americans feel, how their communities are policed and want the justice system to work for everyone,"" Meeks said on ABC's ""This Week."" Meeks and other members of the Congressional Black Caucus expressed outrage at the non-indictment of the two white police officers in the Brown and Garner cases and have led the outcry in Washington. Ray Kelly, a former New York City police commissioner, also knocked de Blasio for not standing with police officers, accusing him of running an anti-police election campaign when he campaigned against the stop and frisk policies. Kelly, also speaking on ""This Week,"" said de Blasio's comments about teaching his black son how to deal with police led up to the police murders on Saturday. ""I think when the mayor made statements about that he had to train his son to be -- his son who is biracial -- to be careful when he's dealing with the police, I think that set off this latest firestorm,"" Kelly said.","Giuliani said anti-cop ""propaganda"" started with President Obama. He also denounced Al Sharpton .

"Turkish riot police fired tear gas and water cannons to disperse thousands of mourners who attended a funeral march Wednesday for a 15-year old boy. Throughout the afternoon, a virtual river of humanity coursed through the streets of Istanbul escorting the coffin of Berkin Elvan. Mourners carrying portraits of the boy and red carnations chanted ""Berkin Elvan, a sapling just 15 years old."" ""The boy was innocent.  The boy wasn't doing anything.  He went to get bread and the police took a shot at him and basically killed him,"" said Dursun Ince, a retired engineer who was one of tens of thousands of demonstrators who participated in the march. Berkin Elvan's death unleashed a wave of grief and rage against the Turkish government that sparked protests in cities across the country. Public messages of condolence issued by Turkey's family affairs minister, as well as a sympathetic phone call from the Turkish President to the father of the boy, did little to calm the outrage. Elvan's mother, Gulsum, has placed blame for the critical injury her son suffered last June squarely on the government and police. The boy was 14 years old when he was last seen conscious stepping out of his home to buy bread for his family's breakfast.  His family says he was next seen 15 minutes later suffering from a horrendous head wound believed to have been inflicted by a tear gas canister fired by Turkish police. For the next nine months, the teenager lay in a coma, wasting away to a weight of just 16 kilograms (35 pounds). Elvan was pronounced dead early Tuesday morning. That night, demonstrators hurled stones, bottles and abuse at Turkish riot police in several Istanbul neighborhoods. ""Killers!"" angry crowds screamed at helmeted police officers on Istanbul's Istiklal Caddesi. ""You killed Berkin Elvan!"" a woman yelled. After initially holding back, squads of riot police began pursuing demonstrators through the streets. Armored personnel carriers patrolled main boulevards, hosing rioting youths with water cannons, which were also periodically used to extinguish burning barricades. On Wednesday, a major labor union called for a nationwide strike in honor of the dead boy. Several of the main opposition political parties, which are in the middle of fierce campaigns ahead of nationwide municipal elections on March 30, announced they would not play music at rallies Wednesday. Turkish television also aired footage of university students in a canteen, banging their silverware on tables in a show of support for the Elvan family. Some high school and university student groups are calling for a boycott of classes Wednesday. ""A small kid is murdered and the killers are still loose. This is us standing up for our kid brother,"" said Bircan Birol, a 22-year-old member of the Student Collectives movement at Istanbul University.  ""There are pictures of Berkin up everywhere, and today we say: 'Our class is Berkin Elvan.' "" Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Turkey's fiery Prime Minister, has yet to mention the Elvan family in any of his daily campaign rallies. Erdogan is fighting hard to mobilize his ruling Justice and Development Party to continue its decade-long electoral winning streak in this month's municipal elections. However, Abdullah Gul, the man who holds the largely symbolic post of Turkish President, personally called the grieving family Monday. ""The family was very grateful for the call. They asked (for) Mr President's help in finding out the security cam recordings of the incident, which, interestingly, couldn't be found so far,"" an official in Abdullah Gul's office wrote CNN in an e-mail, on condition of anonymity because of Turkish protocol. ""And they asked the help of Mr President for calm during the funeral -- and especially that the police shall not intervene. The President told them that he will talk to the governor especially to provide a smooth, calm and respectful funeral without any more bad scenes."" There was little to no visible police presence escorting the funeral procession on Wednesday.  But as the sun began to set in Istanbul, police riot control vehicles began hosing down throngs of demonstrators with water cannons, sending thousands of people sprinting to escape clouds of tear gas. Clashes also erupted in the port city of Izmir on Wednesday, as well as the Turkish capital Ankara.","Thousands march, mourning 15-year-old who died after nine months in coma .

"ALEXANDRIA, Virginia (CNN)  -- Former U.S. Rep. William Jefferson of Louisiana was convicted Wednesday on 11 of the 16 corruption charges against him in a case that included the discovery of $90,000 in his freezer. Former Rep. William Jefferson arrives at U.S. District Court with his wife, Andrea, on June 9. A federal court jury convicted Jefferson on four bribery counts, three counts of money laundering, three counts of wire fraud and one count of racketeering. He was acquitted on five other counts including wire fraud and obstruction of justice. Jefferson, a 62-year-old Democrat, was indicted by a federal grand jury on June 4, 2007, about two years after federal agents said they found the cash in his freezer. Authorities said the cash was part of a payment in marked bills from an FBI informant in a transaction captured on video. Jefferson had pleaded not guilty. He faces a maximum possible sentence of 150 years in prison, with sentencing tentatively set for October 30. After the verdict on the fifth day of jury deliberations, U.S. District Judge T.S. Ellis turned down a prosecution request for Jefferson to be taken into custody, ruling that he posed no flight risk. The verdict showed that ""no person, not even a congressman, is above the law,"" said U.S. Attorney Dana Boente of the Eastern District of Virginia. Asked what might have turned the case in the prosecution's favor, Boente said: ""We always thought that a powerful piece of evidence in this case was $90,000 in a freezer."" A stern-faced Jefferson emerged from the courthouse with his lawyer, Robert Trout, who said the verdict would be appealed. ""We're very disappointed that the jury disagreed with us,"" Trout said. Asked how he was holding up, Jefferson smiled briefly and answered, ""I'm holding up,"" before walking away. Jefferson was accused of using his congressional clout between 2001 and 2005 to solicit and receive hundreds of thousands of dollars in bribes for himself and his family in exchange for promoting products and services in Africa, especially Nigeria, and elsewhere. The information on the cash discovered in Jefferson's Washington home in August 2005 was revealed in an affidavit used to obtain a warrant to search Jefferson's office in May 2006. Descriptions from the heavily redacted affidavit and pictures of the open freezer show bills wrapped in foil and tucked into frozen food containers, including a box for pie crusts and another for veggie burgers. FBI agents told a judge the money was part of a $100,000 payment delivered by an informant in the bribery investigation, which led to guilty pleas by a Kentucky businessman and a former Jefferson aide. Jefferson, who graduated from Harvard Law School, represented Louisiana's 2nd Congressional District, which includes most of the New Orleans area He held office for 18 years, or nine terms, before he lost his House seat to Anh Joseph Cao in the December 2008 election. ""This is a difficult day for the people of New Orleans and Louisiana, but now we can turn the page on a negative past to focus on a positive future,"" Cao said. ""My thoughts and prayers go out to Mr. Jefferson and his family during this time."" As a representative, he served on the House Ways and Means Committee's subcommittee on trade and on the Budget Committee, and he co-chaired the caucus on Africa Trade and Investment as well as the caucus on Nigeria.","NEW: Ex-U.S. Rep.

"(CNN)A meteorite crashed down in Managua, Nicaragua, late Saturday night, causing a loud explosion and leaving a crater 39 feet (12 meters) across, government officials said, according to The Associated Press. No damage or injuries were reported. AP quoted government spokeswoman Rosario Murillo as saying they've determined it was a ""relatively small"" meteorite that ""appears to have come off an asteroid that was passing close to Earth."" NASA hasn't confirmed a link between the meteorite and the asteroid. The newly discovered asteroid, called 2014 RC, was expected to pass safely above the Earth on Sunday, NASA said, at a distance of about 25,000 miles (40,000 kilometers) -- just one-tenth the distance from the center of Earth to the moon. It was estimated to be 60 feet (18 meters) long. Local media reported that scientists are trying to find remains of the meteorite, and Nicaragua is asking the United States to help investigate the event. ""All the evidence that we've confirmed on-site corresponds exactly with a meteorite,"" Jose Millan with the Nicaraguan Institute of Earth Studies was quoted as saying on the Today Nicaragua website. But NASA's Bill Cooke is skeptical. ""It has been suggested that a meteorite may have caused this crater; however, the lack of fireball reports from the surrounding populated area seems to suggest some other cause,"" Cooke wrote in a NASA blog post. ""The skies were partially clear, and an object capable of producing a crater this large would have also generated a very bright fireball (brighter than the Full Moon) that should have been seen over a wide area."" The Today Nicaragua site reported the crater was found after a loud blast about 11:05 p.m. on Saturday. The Nicaragua Dispatch said the hole is in the woods near Managua's Sandino International Airport and about 1,000 feet (300 meters) from the Camino Real Hotel. NASA's Near Earth Object Program estimates there are thousands of asteroids that could threaten Earth, but experts say none of the ones being tracked is expected to hit the planet anytime soon. Sometimes, though, space rocks sneak by the scientists and amateur astronomers who track them. On February 15, 2013, a nearly 60-foot-wide meteor plunged into Earth's atmosphere and exploded over the Russian city of Chelyabinsk with the force of about 30 nuclear bombs. The blast injured about 1,500 people. The Chelyabinsk meteor was undetected before it was spotted by local residents as it streaked across the sky. It exploded on the same day that Asteroid 2012 DA14, one that was being carefully tracked by NASA, safely passed by Earth. NASA is trying to speed up the way it tracks potentially hazardous asteroids and to learn how to deflect rocks that threaten Earth. Its Asteroid Initiative includes a plan to capture an asteroid and tug it into orbit around the moon in the 2020s. If it works, astronauts will land on the asteroid, take samples and bring them back to Earth.","NASA blogger: The lack of fireball reports suggests a meteorite was not the cause .

"U.S. officers shot a Canadian man who walked toward a border inspection booth waving what they said looked like a handgun early Sunday. U.S. Customs and Border Protection said in a statement that the man stopped his car around 3 a.m. near a booth on the Ambassador Bridge, which goes between Detroit and the Canadian city of Windsor. As he walked toward them with what appeared to be a black handgun, the officers ordered him to drop the weapon, the statement said. When he pointed it in their direction, they opened fire. Officials at first said the man they shot had been waving a handgun. But investigators later determined that the man was holding a replica of a handgun, U.S. Customs and Border Protection spokesman Kris Grogan said. Authorities have not released the identity of the man, who they described as a Canadian citizen. He was shot in the arm, treated for his injuries and then taken into custody, Grogan said. Citing Windsor police, CNN partner CTV said the man has had previous encounters with Canadian law enforcement and confronted police officers minutes before the shooting on the bridge. After receiving a call reporting a man with a gun in the parking lot of a McDonald's near the border around 2:40 a.m., Windsor police officers arrived at the scene and ordered the man to drop his weapon, police said. According to police, the man said, ""Why haven't you shot me yet?"" Then he got back in his vehicle and drove away. The Department of Homeland Security's Office of the Inspector General, U.S Customs and Border Protection's Office of Internal Affairs and the Detroit Police are investigating.","Investigators determine a man shot at the border had a replica of a handgun .

"(CNN) -- Dressed modestly, with a red headscarf loosely draped over her head and shoulders, she steps onto the stage and nervously paces back and forth. Waiting for the music to begin and break the silence, she almost misses her first note before quietly singing into the microphone. Her voice chokes when one of four judges turns his chair to face her; she awkwardly bows her head and smiles. But she sings more confidently when the sole female judge turns around a few minutes later. The singer is through to the next stage. In a country ranked by a Thomson Reuters Foundation poll as the most dangerous place in the world for women in 2011, what Shabana Faryad did was brave. Very brave. Faryad was the only female contestant to have auditioned for the first series of ""The Voice of Afghanistan"" last year. And the claps and cheers that loudly resounded throughout the studio came from an audience of men. Aryana Sayeed -- a popular Afghan singer who was a judge on the show -- said she turned her chair around purely because the contestant was a woman. ""I had to do it,"" she said. ""She at least had the courage to come along, to step onto the stage."" But Sayeed says her own appearance on the show put her life at risk. Dressed in fashionable, figure-hugging attire, certain religious hard liners were angered by the fact that her wardrobe lacked one item: a headscarf. In the view of her critics, women should be covered and compliant. As a result, Sayeed says mullahs threatened her with death. ""They said that whoever kills this singer would go to heaven,"" she recalls. ""It was getting really difficult, I couldn't go anywhere. I was basically a prisoner in my hotel room, I had bodyguards with me all the time."" Sayeed, 28, was born and raised in Kabul and left at the age of eight with her parents and five sisters for Pakistan, where she lived for a few years before heading to Switzerland. She eventually settled in London in 2000. War and violence forced her family to flee Afghanistan. ""All I have seen and have grown up with is war, guns and problems,"" she says, recalling an incident when a rocket hit a tree in her garden in the early hours of the morning while she and her family were sleeping. ""We used to hear the gunshots all the time, it had become so normal,"" Sayeed says. ""You heard them while you were just sitting there talking and it didn't even scare you. I remember all that when I was a child."" At the age of 24, after convincing her family to allow her to pursue a career as a singer -- a profession which she says is looked down upon for Afghan women -- Sayeed rose to fame in her homeland and travelled back and forth for television appearances and concerts. She released 'Lady of the Land of Fire,' her first female-empowerment song, last year. It opens with provocative scenes of the violence and oppression experienced by Afghan women. ""Who says I am a mother to this world?"" Sayeed sings. ""I am nothing but a burden on the son's shoulders, I am a slave because I am a wife, I am a headache when I am a sister."" The video, shot on the streets of Kabul, was released during the time when the singer was receiving death threats. Softly spoken yet self-assured, Sayeed says she is targeted because of her openness about women's rights and not just because of how she dresses. ""If I just did my concerts and my music, most of these extremists would not have cared so much as they are caring right now."" She also feels her aims are misinterpreted and that women should have the freedom to choose how they dress. ""When I talk about freedom and women's rights, it's not that you have to take your scarves off. I never say that. My mum wears a scarf and I respect that."" The gallery at the top of this page shows the contrast between Afghanistan, past and present: during the 1950s to 1970s, women could walk the streets in skirts and high heels -- a far cry from the usual burqa-clad images which circulate today. ""My mum was somebody who had chosen to wear a scarf, whereas my auntie would wear short skirts,"" recalls Sayeed. ""They were free to do whatever they wanted... My aunt is now having to cover up. She even has to cover up the new generation, her children, even more than her. It's unbelievable."" Sayeed is reminded of a story another aunt told her, about how she was walking down the street wearing a burqa and white slippers. Members of the Taliban, in power from 1994 to 2001, saw her and beat her -- for wearing the color of their flag on her feet. ""This was a 60-year-old woman who had the freedom, when she was young, to go to school, work, have a normal life. And now, even though she was wearing a burqa, they picked on her because of her shoes."" Sayeed says she regularly receives a barrage of abusive messages on her Facebook page, criticizing her for dressing liberally. But she is driven by those who value her work, especially girls and women who write appreciative letters and embrace her after concerts. However, there are some fans she is particularly concerned about: after holding a ladies-only concert a couple of months ago, she received messages pleading for help. She says mullahs had seen clips of a group of females attending the show -- and labelled them as whores. ""They were so scared; they only came out [to the concert] because of me,"" Sayeed says. Despite the singer's efforts to reply and offer help, she has not heard back from them. ""It's something that's stuck in my mind."" She pauses, her voice slightly breaking. ""I'm thinking about it all the time."" But Afghanistan has seen some advances. Women appearing on TV were forbidden under Taliban rule: times have changed with shows like ""The Voice."" Women also have a say in the current presidential elections. Their right to vote was reinstated after U.S. and allied military toppled the Taliban in 2001. ""To other people it's just an election, but it's such an emotional time for me,"" says Sayeed, ""looking at these women voting with ink on their fingers and so much passion and hope. They have a choice to choose a leader now, before it was never the case."" Personal reasons may stop her from participating as a judge on season two of ""The Voice,"" set to run soon, she explains. But she asserts that the threats have not disheartened her. Her next single, ""Champion,"" will be released this year and bears another powerful message on women's rights. ""Champion is about, no matter what you say to me, no matter what you do to me, I'm not going to give up."" Fact is, there isn't much that can stop Sayeed from carrying out her advocacy, which she feels is her duty to her fellow Afghan women. ""For me, since I've been travelling to Afghanistan, seen the women, heard the stories, seen the country from close, it has affected me so much. It has become my number one priority, more than anything else, even my music. And I'm going to carry on doing it.""","Popular Afghan singer Aryana Sayeed has received death threats for dressing liberally .

"It's not easy being Jordan and it is about to become even more difficult, again. Sandwiched in between Iraq and Syria, Jordan's destiny seems to be one of a constant struggle for survival. This violent storyline was written over a decade ago during the Iraq war. The latest outbreak of violence after ISIS swept through Mosul and beyond has Jordan's inner circle and the business community drawing up worst scenarios, with Syria and Iraq representing bookends of trouble. Jordan is now home to more than 1.3 million Syrian refugees, half absorbed during the last 24 months.  As a sign of the times, on a video shoot down to the Mafraq region two hours south Amman, we saw scores of second hand UNHCR tents that are now being utilized by Bedouins. The refugee crisis is costing Jordan $3 billion a year, about a quarter of the kingdom's annual budget expenditure, according to Finance Minister Umayya Toukan. In an interview in Amman, the former central banker made some strong statements, albeit delivered in his affable, soft-spoken manner. ""The extraordinary burden of the Syrian crisis, as well as any potential regional crisis including the Iraqi situation, should also be met by the international community,"" Toukan told me. ""There should be much more international assistance."" Youth unemployment of over 24% is keeping pressure on the government. Syrians are now competing against Jordanians for low-paying jobs, whether in hospitality or light manufacturing. Toukan said a half billion dollars in total was received last year between the U.S. and Saudi Arabia. While the government is appreciative of that support and loan guarantees to help lower the debt burden, in reality it is not enough to plug a gaping hole in Jordan's finances. The budget deficit is running above 9% of GDP, although government officials suggest growth of 5% would have been possible without Iraq factored in. But Iraq is now very much part of the equation. Oil imports have been cut off for the past few months as violence has escalated.  A sizeable $1.8 billion oil export pipeline from Basra in southern Iraq to the Red Sea Jordanian port of Aqaba may be delayed, sources suggest, due to the violence. King Abdullah's master plan for growth has been subject to a series of setbacks. Jordan signed a free trade agreement with the U.S. in 2000, the same year it joined the World Trade Organization. He is often referred to in the Davos community as the business friendly monarch, who remains a close ally of Washington, London and Brussels. But, members of his cabinet suggest, the King's role as a voice of moderation in a zone of chaos should not be taken for granted. ""We feel we are not getting enough to continue to play our moderating role in the region and meeting the needs of all those refugees is not only a humanitarian issues, it also neutralizes any extremist tendencies,"" said Toukan.

"Washington (CNN)President Barack Obama says he doesn't consider North Korea's hack of Sony Pictures ""an act of war."" ""It was an act of cybervandalism,"" Obama said in an interview with CNN's Candy Crowley that aired Sunday on ""State of the Union."" Obama said that the United States is going review whether to put North Korea back on a list of states that sponsor terrorism. ""We've got very clear criteria as to what it means for a state to sponsor terrorism. And we don't make those judgments just based on the news of the day,"" he said. ""We look systematically at what's been done and based on those facts, we'll make those determinations in the future."" The President stuck by his criticism of Sony's decision to cancel its plans to release the movie ""The Interview,"" which includes a cartoonish depiction of the assassination of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, after the country threatened attacks against theaters that showed it. Obama said in a Friday news conference that Sony made ""a mistake,"" and that he wished the company had called him first. That led Sony Entertainment CEO Michael Lynton to tell CNN that Obama and the public ""are mistaken as to what actually happened."" He blamed movie theater companies that opted not to show the film, saying they forced Sony's hand. Related: Sony exec fires back at Obama . Investigators: Hackers stole Sony passwords . Obama shot back, saying: ""I was pretty sympathetic to the fact that they have business considerations that they got to make. Had they talked to me directly about this decision, I might have called the movie theater chains and distributors and asked them what the story was."" The President told Crowley that his problem wasn't with Sony specifically, but with the precedent the company's decision set. The FBI on Friday pinned blame on North Korea for a hack into Sony's computer systems. Obama said both foreign governments and hackers outside government present cyberthreats that are part of the modern business landscape. ""If we set a precedent in which a dictator in another country can disrupt through cyber, a company's distribution chain or its products, and as a consequence we start censoring ourselves, that's a problem,"" Obama said. ""And it's a problem not just for the entertainment industry, it's a problem for the news industry,"" he said. ""CNN has done critical stories about North Korea. What happens if in fact there is a breach in CNN's cyberspace? Are we going to suddenly say, are we not going to report on North Korea? ""So the key here is not to suggest that Sony was a bad actor. It's making a broader point that all of us have to adapt to the possibility of cyberattacks, we have to do a lot more to guard against them."" Lynton, speaking to CNN's Fareed Zakaria, said he was ""disappointed"" in what Obama said Friday. ""We have not given in. And we have not backed down. We have always had every desire to have the American public see this movie,"" Lynton said. But that's not what the company initially said after canceling the film's release. On Wednesday night, a studio spokesperson said simply, ""Sony Pictures has no further release plans for the film."" The nonprofit Human Rights Foundation is pushing a campaign called #HackThemBack, inviting ""those who support freedom and democracy"" to ""help North Korean defectors amplify, refine, and intensify efforts to break the monopoly of information"" that the regime imposes on its people. The group also plans to buy copies of ""The Interview"" and include them in balloon drops over North Korea, founder Thor Halvorssen said. More from Candy Crowley's interview with President Obama: .

"Glittering jackets, pounding drums and faces covered in bright paints -- welcome to Cape Town's New Year carnival celebrations. Thousands of lively performers dressed in eye-catching costumes paraded Saturday through the South African city, dancing and singing as throngs of cheering spectators swelled the streets to revel in the carnival atmosphere. More than 70 minstrel troupes -- sporting panama hats and colorful bow-ties, as well as carrying umbrellas and waving parasols -- set the city center alive as brass bands and singers entertained the crowds to the beat of ghoema drums during this year's ""Tweede Nuwe Jaar"" (""Second New Year) parade. Read this: Five African festivals you can't miss . ""(It) may be compared to Mardi Gras in New Orleans and Rio de Janeiro, or the Notting Hill Carnival in London,"" says South African Michael Hutchinson, author of ""Bo-Kaap: Colourful Heart of Cape Town"" and ""Mixit - Voices of the Bo-Kaap."" The annual street party, which usually takes place on January 2, rather than January 4, came after months of preparations for the participating troupes -- each group of dancers, singers and performers had to prepare their own colorful uniforms and practice their performance routines well in advance. Rooted in slavery . The vibrant open-air celebrations, which are deeply rooted in the local Cape Malay population's culture and traditions, have been shaped by varied influences over the years. Yet, it is widely believed that their origins can be traced back to the dark days of slavery during South Africa's colonial period. ""The story goes that Tweede Nuwe Jaar was the day on which the Malay slaves were given time off, because their masters celebrated on New Year's Day,"" says Hutchinson. Read more: Lagos festival puts mega city in the spotlight . In 1830s, slavery came to an end and the former slaves took to the streets to celebrate their freedom. These emancipation celebrations were apparently merged with the New Year festivities, creating a tradition that grew stronger in the following decades. It is also understood that the carnival's current form has been influenced by the songs, costumes and performances of African American minstrels who arrived in Cape Town in 1860s to entertain crowds. The first edition of the carnival in its current form took place in 1907 and while the festivities were severely restricted during apartheid, the carnival has been growing in popularity in recent years.

"If you're trying to create the perfect 21st-century city, it helps to start with a blank slate. Even if that slate is a sweltering strip of sand. That's essentially what the government of Qatar and its developers are trying with Lusail, an ambitious planned city on 28 square miles of waterfront desert along the Persian Gulf. Now under construction, the compact city will contain a commercial district, a lagoon, four islands, two marinas, an upscale shopping mall, a hospital, a zoo, two golf courses and housing for some 250,000 people. It also will feature an 86,000-seat soccer stadium, surrounded by a moat, that's expected to host the final game of the 2022 FIFA World Cup. Residents and visitors will get around via a light-rail network, a water-taxi system and a network of underground pedestrian tunnels. And all the energy, communications and transportation systems will be run with the help of computers from a single command center, making Lusail a ""smart"" city that can automatically adapt to changing traffic and weather conditions. ""It's very much an opportunity to build a vision of the future,"" said Barry Hughes, senior vice president at HOK, the global architectural firm that designed Lusail's Marina Mall shopping center. Funded by the oil-rich Qatari government, Lusail can offer innovative solutions to urban problems because it's being built from the ground up. For example, the city's gas, electric and water lines are being laid out in an underground network of tunnels, allowing for maintenance work that won't disrupt buildings, roads or people above. The city will be fitted with a network of surveillance cameras, monitored around the clock, to keep streets safe. City of Tomorrow: 15 futuristic buildings . Buildings will be cooled by solar power and chilled water pumped through a vast network of pipes, which the city's developers say is cheaper and more energy efficient than electrical air conditioning. Human waste will be disposed not through sewer lines but a more efficient network of pneumatic, or vacuum tubes, not unlike the ones at your bank's drive-up window. Related story: Should smart cities be built from scratch? Some 20,000 workers -- a small city unto itself -- are building Lusail at an estimated cost of $45 billion. Developers hope to complete the city by 2019, three years before Qatar is scheduled to become the first Arab country to host the World Cup. But all the city's sparkling features will lose some of their luster if soccer's big global tournament gets moved to another locale. Some activists have been pressuring FIFA, soccer's international governing body, to reconsider Qatar for a variety of reasons: allegations of bribery, the country's condemnation of homosexuality and the blistering summer heat, which can reach 120 degrees Fahrenheit. There also have been allegations that Qatar has used slave labor -- mostly migrant workers from Nepal -- to build Lusail's infrastructure. A report last year by the Guardian, the UK newspaper, said at least 44 construction workers had died of heart attacks and other ailments in a two-month period of 2013 amid grueling conditions. The state-run Lusail Real Estate Development Company, which is spearheading construction of the city, has said it's ""extremely concerned"" about the slave-labor allegations. In a statement on its website, the company added that it's investigating the charges, which involve one of its subcontractors. ""Lusail City will not tolerate breaches of labor or health and safety law,"" the company said in the statement, posted in response to the Guardian article. It declined to respond to CNN's requests for comment. City of Tomorrow: How oceans can help solve our water crisis . In response to criticisms, Qatar in May announced reforms to its labor laws, which had bound workers to a single employer and left them open to exploitation. This appeared to satisfy FIFA President Sepp Blatter, who called the changes ""a significant step in the right direction."" As for the brutal heat, Qatar says its stadiums will contain advanced, open-air cooling systems that will keep World Cup players and fans comfortable. Meanwhile, Lusail continues to rise slowly in the Qatar desert. Anchoring the city's skyline will be four commercial towers, up to 75 stories each. These will be surrounded by five-star hotels, an entertainment district and the Marina Mall, a retail palace measuring more than 600,000 square feet. Scheduled to open in 2017, the mall is a cluster of five interconnected pods, shaped like giant boulders, with cantilevered white roofs to repel the heat. Its architects want the space to evoke desert canyons. A canal runs through it, and waterfalls splash throughout. The scope and design of the mall echoes the grand, futuristic vision for Lusail itself. ""It is a very ambitious and optimistic plan,"" said Daniel Hajjar, a senior vice president in HOK's Dubai office. It's a plan that has helped land Qatar the World Cup. But Hajjar said Lusail will be completed even if FIFA has a change of heart and finds a new host for the event. ""Qatar has a path ... they're pursuing,"" he said. ""It won't affect their decision to move forward and get it built.""","Lusail is an ambitious planned city rising along the Persian Gulf in Qatar .

"A choir of protests echoed through the country's quintessential megamall, when a few hundred demonstrators from Black Lives Matter raised their voices at the Mall of America. They held the protest Saturday against the Bloomington, Minnesota, mall's wishes, and were met by police who made at least 20 arrests, CNN affiliate KARE reported. ""We are extremely disappointed that organizers of Black Lives Matter protest chose to ignore our stated policy and repeated reminders that political protests and demonstrations are not allowed on Mall of America property,"" AoM's said in a statement. The mall bills itself as the nation's largest with more than 500 businesses. It is big enough to hold seven Yankee Stadiums, its management boasts. It is home to an indoor roller coaster, the Sea Life Aquarium, and about a dozen more attractions, but on Saturday amusement was drowned out by echoes of ""black lives matter"" and ""no justice, no peace."" Marchers raised their hands in the air and lay down to play dead -- simulating the deaths of young black men Michael Brown of Ferguson, Missouri, and Eric Garner, of New York, in confrontations with police. As protesters unfurled banners of ""hands up, don't shoot,"" the mall answered with a video wall message in all caps reading: . ""This demonstration is not authorized and is in clear violation of Mall of America policy. We expect all participants to disperse at this time. Those who continue to demonstrate will be subject to arrest."" Management shut down the stores on one side of the mall. Officers called out to the crowd to leave, police spokesman Mark Stehlik told KARE. But officers seemed patient, giving protesters multiple chances to comply. ""They could have arrested me; they could have escorted me. They just asked me nicely to leave, and I did,"" said Michael McDowell, one of the protest organizers. Police then arrested some who were less willing to leave on their own, KARE reported. Prosecutors plan to throw the book at them. ""They knowingly broke the law. They were involved in a situation that was very potentially dangerous,""  city prosecutor Sandra Johnson said.","Police arrest at least 20 demonstrators, CNN affiliate reports .

"The gateway to Japan's capital, Tokyo Station, is celebrating its centennial this month -- and it's never looked better. The starting point of the country's railway network, travelers in Japan are likely to pass through this landmark at least once. Situated in the city's historic and political center, Tokyo Station is a destination in its own right. Here are 10 ways it's earned its stripes as a protected cultural landmark. Big numbers . Tokyo Station is an impressive 1,000-feet long (304 meters). It's the busiest station in Japan in terms of number of trains per day (more than 3,000); 350,000 passengers pass through its turnstiles on a daily basis. The station also reportedly earns more revenue than any other station in Japan. It has 14 lines, including the Tokaido Shinkansen, the most heavily traveled high-speed rail route in the world. Architectural marvel . City planners completed a five-year, $625 million renovation of Tokyo Station in 2012. At its heart is the red brick Marunouchi Building, featuring reconstructions of two roof domes that were were destroyed in World War II bombings. Its European facade is one of the few architectural remnants of Tokyo's past, and symbolizes the country's modernization. Eight zodiacal symbols are featured on the interior of the octagonal domes, representing points on a compass (the tiger, for instance, points northeast). Some say the Marunouchi Building was designed to look like Amsterdam Centraal railway station. Though there's little evidence to support this, Tokyo does have sister-station agreements with its Dutch lookalike, and also Grand Central Terminal in New York. Secret tunnels . Urban myth or reality? A subterranean network is rumored to exist in downtown Tokyo, linking important government buildings. The oldest of these is a passage connecting Tokyo Station with the Central Post Office, whose original 1930s veneer was restored in the 2012 makeover. From Tokyo Station, passengers can access six neighboring stations via underground walkways, with one jaunt being more than two kilometers. Many people believe this labyrinthine network was planned as a bomb shelter. Nowadays, with natural disasters a more prevalent worry, Tokyo Station is one of the safest places to be when the Earth rumbles, as the entire station is protected by a seismic isolation structure. Multilingual tourism hub . Rail company JR East operates a travel service center at Marunouchi's north exit offering currency exchange, a luggage storage counter (7:30 a.m.-8:30 p.m.) and even a porter service for the first-class set. Free Wi-Fi is available (a precious commodity in Tokyo), as well as PCs for visitors. In the adjacent JP Tower skyscraper, which houses the renovated Central Post Office, Tokyo City is a tourism resource with walls of brochures in various languages, and staff who can help with all travel needs. The post office upstairs is open all year, with 24-hour postage and foreign-card-friendly ATMs. Assassination attempts . Murder, intrigue, politics ... Tokyo Station has witnessed two assassination attempts on Japanese prime ministers. In 1921, Takashi Hara was stabbed to death by an ultra-conservative railway employee. Hara was Japan's first Christian prime minister, and the first commoner to hold the office. Nine years later, Osachi Hamaguchi befell a similar fate, only he was shot. He didn't die immediately, succumbing to wounds the following year. Both prime ministers are memorialized with plaques in the station. Tokyo Station gallery . When this museum reopened in 2012, the goal was to create ""a small but real gallery."" Today, visitors can take in exhibits showing contemporary art, or on themes related to railways, architecture and design. More than 2.3 million visitors have passed through since the gallery's opening in 1988. Purchases of JR train tickets help support this small but real museum. Illumination . Holiday light-ups are standard fare for the neon capital. The GranRoof facility near the Yaesu exit hosts this year's ""Tokyo Colors,"" (January 12-February 14), an interactive wonder where lights and music change based on weather conditions and visitor numbers. There's also Tokyo Michi Terrace, an illumination projected on station buildings that takes a ""Memorial Light-up/Taisho Period (1912-1926) Romance"" theme, in honor of the station's birthday. Street of noodles . No Tokyo discussion would be complete without food. In the station you can wander through Kitchen Street, or for slurpier, cheaper meals, Tokyo Ramen Street. Both are located at the station's Yaesu exit; neither is a true outdoor road. Some of Tokyo's most acclaimed ramen joints have set up shop here, including Rokurinsha, famous for its tsukemen (dipping-style noodles). It's best to arrive for breakfast from 7:30-10 a.m. to avoid the crowds. Yes, ramen for breakfast is a thing in Tokyo. For more conventional morning eats, there's New York outposts Bubby's or Dean and Deluca. Or, passengers can pick up an ekiben (bento lunch box) on their dash to the bullet train. Souvenir heaven . It's possible to spend a lot of money, and time, at Tokyo Station. Fans of Hello Kitty, Moomins and Pokemon should swing by Tokyo Character Street (again, also not a real street) for take-home trinkets from some 15 shops. For edible gifts, plenty of themed candies and the like are available, such as Tokyo Terminal Cookies or Brick Bread. And let's not forget Tokyo Banana, the Twinkie's long lost cousin that has no known relation to the city yet is wildly popular (and pretty tasty). Centenarian hotel . Tokyo Station Hotel celebrates its 100-year anniversary in 2015. The swanky, European-style building was a social hub after the Great Hanshin Earthquake, as Tokyo Station miraculously evaded any damage. Political elite still gather here in the afternoons. Room rates start at around ¥37,000 ($310).","Japan's historic Tokyo Station turns 100 years old this month .

"New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie -- a potential 2016 Republican presidential candidate -- finally broke his silence on President Barack Obama's decision to normalize relations with Cuba in a letter to the President issued on Sunday. Christie urged Obama to demand Cuba hand over Joanne Chesimard, an American fugitive who escaped from prison after she was convicted of killing a New Jersey state trooper. Christie also joined the chorus of Republicans who oppose Obama's decision to re-establish ties with Cuba without substantial political reforms. Chesimard, now known as Assata Shakur, was a member of the militant group the Black Liberation Army and gained political asylum in Cuba, where she lives freely. Chesimard is on the FBI's most wanted terrorist list, with a $1 million reward for information leading to her capture. Who is Assata Shakur? ""Despite my profound disagreement with this decision, I believe there is an opportunity for Cuba and its government to show the American people it is serious about change,"" Christie wrote to Obama, according to a copy of the letter Christie's office provided. ""If, as you assert, Cuba is serious about embracing democratic principles then this action would be an essential first step."" Christie added that he was ""very disappointed"" that Chesimard's return was not already one of the conditions of normalizing relations in Obama's deal with Cuban President Raul Castro. ""The family of her victims, like so many of those who have, and continue to suffer under the Castro regime, deserve this basic decency before further steps toward Cuba are taken by this government,"" Christie wrote. Senate Republicans, including Lindsey Graham and Marco Rubio, have already vowed to do everything they can to prevent or blunt the impact of Obama's efforts to normalize relations with Cuba. The pair -- members of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee -- pledged to tie up funds for a planned embassy and to prevent Obama's nominee for ambassador to win confirmation.","New Jersey Gov.

"President Barack Obama says he plans to push to close the Guantanamo Bay detention facility during his final two years in office -- potentially fulfilling a major campaign promise that he hasn't yet accomplished. ""I'm going to be doing everything I can to close it,"" Obama said in an interview with CNN's Candy Crowley that aired Sunday on ""State of the Union."" ""It is something that continues to inspire jihadists and extremists around the world, the fact that these folks are being held,"" Obama said. ""It is contrary to our values."" Related: Obama calls alleged North Korea hacking vandalism, not war . The President's comments follow a flurry of executive action at the start of what he called his ""fourth quarter"" in the Oval Office -- after Republicans walloped Democrats in November's midterm elections, taking control of both houses of Congress. After the election, Obama quickly announced an overhaul of U.S. immigration rules and new regulations aimed at curbing environmentally-harmful emissions. He followed those moves this week with a deal that represented the biggest steps to thaw the economic freeze with Cuba in decades. The Guantanamo Bay, Cuba detention facility -- which Obama pledged to shut down as part of his 2008 campaign, but saw his plans thwarted when Congress passed a law prohibiting him from doing so -- could be another target ripe for executive action. Obama's year-end message: North Korea Cuba and Congress . Obama has transferred many of the detainees housed at that facility to other countries in recent months, and said Friday he'll continue trying to do that, since Congress won't allow him to shift those detainees into federal Supermax facilities within the United States. ""We are going to continue to place those who have been cleared for release or transfer to host countries that are willing to take them,"" Obama told Crowley. Related: Guantanamo detainees release . The toughest challenge, he said, is dealing with ""some really hard cases"" in which ""we know they've done something wrong and are still dangerous.""

Several devices, including shoulder pads, are used for folding the suit. While packing a suit in the suitpack does take a bit of time and requires step-by-step instructions for the first few goes, the time saved at the other end by not having to press or steam it in the shower makes it worth the learning curve. It's light, sturdy, looks decent and can fit enough extras to accommodate all other clothing needs for a short one-bag-only business trip. It can also get on the plane as carry-on.

"Moscow, Russia (CNN)  -- Russia's president and the newly elected president of Ukraine signed a landmark agreement on Wednesday that signals an end to years of enmity between the two former Soviet republics. Russia agreed to a 30 percent drop in the price of natural gas sold to Ukraine, in exchange for permission to extend Russia's lease of a major naval base in the Black Sea port of Sevastopol, Ukraine, for 25 years. Seated side by side, Russian President Dmitry Medvedev and Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych announced the agreement at the end of a one-day summit in the eastern Ukrainian border city of Kharkiv. ""We have indeed reached an unprecedented agreement,"" Medvedev said. ""The rent [for the naval base] will be increased by an amount equivalent to that of the [gas price] discount."" The agreement may bring an end to years of disputes over natural gas prices, which culminated in Russia turning off the pipeline to Ukraine. The gas dispute left Ukrainians and many Europeans who depend on Russian gas pumped through Ukraine shivering. Ukraine and Russia had been at odds ever since the ""Orange Revolution"" swept Yanukovych's anti-Russian predecessor Viktor Yushchenko to power in 2005. Throughout his time in office, Yushchenko repeatedly threatened to expel Russia's Black Sea Fleet from Sevastopol. The Russian military lease there was scheduled to expire in 2017. ""The prolongation of the Black Sea Fleet's presence in Sevastopol is essential to Russia,"" Yanukovych said on Wednesday. ""We understand that the Black Sea Fleet will be one of the guarantors of security on the Black Sea."" The Kremlin-friendly Yanukovych, who hails from predominantly Russian-speaking eastern Ukraine, trounced Yushchenko in national elections in January. The Russian president said the new deal added a ""concrete and pragmatic dimension,"" to centuries of relations between Ukrainians and Russians. Opposition groups in Ukraine, however, were quick to denounce the agreement. Former President Yuschenko's ""Our Ukraine"" party said the treaty would lead to the ""Russification"" of Ukraine. Former Ukrainian Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko said the agreement violated part of the Ukrainian Constitution, which forbids the country from hosting foreign military bases after 2017. According to a spokesman for the Russian president, the new accords will be submitted to the Russian and Ukrainian parliaments for ratification simultaneously on April 27.","Russia agrees to 30 percent drop in the price of natural gas sold to Ukraine .

"(CNN) -- The Navy has halted discharge proceedings against a sailor who was found asleep in the same bed with another male sailor, according to a announcement Friday by Servicemembers United, the nation's largest organization of gay and lesbian troops and veterans. Petty Officer Stephen Jones, who is stationed at the Naval Nuclear Power Training Command in Charleston, South Carolina, has said that the Navy's effort to discharge him for ""unprofessional conduct"" was a trumped-up charge based on the command's suspicion that he might be gay. Jones also said the nonjudicial punishment for unprofessional conduct was a maneuver around the ""don't ask, don't tell"" repeal that President Obama signed into law in December. When contacted by CNN, Navy officials didn't have an immediate comment. Alexander Nicholson, executive director of Servicemembers United, said the Navy ""undoubtedly did the right thing in reversing its decision,"" made in March, to discharge Jones, who dozed off beside another male sailor while watching television on February 5. In a recent interview with CNN, Jones, a student at the Nuclear Power Training Command, said another male sailor stopped by that night and they both inadvertently fell asleep on Jones' bed while they watched the CW TV show ""Vampire Diaries."" ""We strongly suspected that his command was trying to find a roundabout way to discharge Jones because it suspected him of being gay, and we simply were not willing to stand by and watch a new version of 'don't ask, don't tell' emerge under the new label of 'unprofessional conduct,' "" Nicholson said in a statement. Jones hired civilian attorney Gary Myers, a former JAG officer who is one of the most experienced civilian military defense attorneys in the country, to fight his discharge, and Servicemembers United worked closely with Jones and Myers to help publicize the case and persuade Navy leaders to retain Jones, according to the Servicemembers United statement. In the CNN interview, Jones, 21, said the other sailor had ""come over to watch shows in the past."" His roommate walked in around midnight, Jones said. ""My roommate walked in and it woke me up,"" Jones said. He then woke up his friend, Navy Petty Officer Bryan McGee, who, according to Jones, immediately left the room. The Navy had sought to discharge Jones under charges of ""willful failure to exhibit professional conduct,"" Myers told CNN in a recent interview. ""It is a violation of the Command Instruction for sailors to act unprofessionally in the barracks. It is considered unprofessional conduct to share the same bed in Navy barracks,"" Thomas Dougan, a spokesman for the Naval Nuclear Power Training Command, said in an interview published in March. The Navy has denied the separation proceedings are based on the suspicion of homosexual behavior. ""Naval Nuclear Power Training Command is not administratively processing either of these sailors for separation based on sexual orientation,"" Dougan said. Jones, who says nothing sexual happened, said that they were both clothed -- him in pajama pants and a white T-shirt and McGee in boxers -- and that they were not under the covers together. Jones was lying above the covers, while McGee was below them. The play-by-play given by Jones is substantiated by the naval investigating documents, although a different account of the amount of clothing worn was given by Jones' roommate, who said in his naval statement that both sailors were dressed only in their boxers. Jones' roommate, who was made uncomfortable by what he saw, moved out of the room a day later and reported the incident to command officials, Myers said. An investigation was launched, ending with the Command attempting to punish Jones and McGee by a captain's mast, a nonjudicial procedure meant to avoid a court martial. McGee, who declined to comment on the case, accepted the mast and punishment, but Jones refused, moving the Navy to begin proceedings to discharge him. Punishment by captain's mast could have resulted in loss of rank or forfeiture of pay, or it could have jeopardized Jones' top secret security clearance, Myers said. ""I'm not pleading guilty to something that I didn't do. I did not commit a crime,"" Jones said in a recent interview. ""I am the type of person that takes responsibility for my actions. If I break a rule, I take my punishment. And I know I did not break any rules."" Jones said he wants to become a nuclear operator on an aircraft carrier or a submarine. CNN's Adam Levine and Michael Martinez contributed to this report.","Petty Officer Stephen Jones dozed off beside another male sailor while watching TV .

"Every five minutes a woman in India is compelled to visit a police station and report a case of cruelty -- usually one committed by her own husband or family. Every ten minutes a woman in India reports assault. Every 21 minutes one of them reports a rape. The numbers are no secret: you can do the math from the National Crime Records Bureau yourself. The total number of these assorted cases has increased in each of the last five documented years, making for a 25% jump over this period. But the numbers don't tell the complete truth. At the very least, they are frequently misrepresented. With each high profile rape in India -- sensationally reported in national and sometimes international media -- the increased number of reported crimes is cited as an example of how the incidence rape in India is on a steep upward curve. But it's a lazy correlation. In reality, we don't really know that the number of cases of rape are on the rise. All we know is that more women are reporting these crimes -- perhaps, in part, because of the spotlight on them. Either way, the number of women not reporting rapes and other crimes is a far bigger statistic -- many are undocumented, brushed under the carpet, forgotten. Gender gap . How do we explain why India has so many cases? There are likely a number of complex sociological factors but there's not much hard data. One useful indicator of the safety of Indian women is to look at how they compare globally on freedom. The World Economic Forum's new Gender Gap Index gives India a dismal scorecard -- worse than in previous years. India's women rank 134th in the world (out of 142 countries) for economic opportunities; they place 126th in the world for educational attainment; 141st in the world for health and survival. These are all basic rights that would empower them, make them less likely to be silent victims. SURVEY: Women earn much less than men generally . The only parameter India performs well on is on having a female head of state or government, where it ranks a surprising first. But the parameter itself is flawed. In 15 of the 21 years the study counts, Indira Gandhi was prime minister. History will hardly portray Gandhi's achievements as solely a triumph for Indian women; her victory and the length of her rule was also a triumph of her lineage (Gandhi's father was Jawaharlal Nehru, India's first prime minister. She shared no relation to the legendary Mahatma Gandhi, but her surname -- acquired through marriage -- didn't hurt.) A more reliable indicator of the political empowerment of India's women is how it places 111th in the world for electing female parliamentarians, and 107th in the world for voting in female ministers. Born at a disadvantage . Why the sorry state of India's women? Why are they so far behind? The sad reality is that it begins before women are even born. According to India's census, there are 940 women for every 1,000 men. In part, the difference exists because of decades of female infanticide -- the practice where families abort fetuses on discovering their sex. When girls are born, they're born with the promise of a second class life. While men enjoy a literacy rate of 82%, only 65% of Indian women can read or write. Girls in India have long been considered a burden, a cause for losing money in marriages and dowries. Data and anecdotes alike show that Indian women have been unwanted and unloved for decades. Consider how families pressure their daughters-in-law for baby boys, not girls. Consider how in rural India, many Indian parents mistreat their daughters-in-law, demanding dowries, mothers-in-law meting out the same discrimination they were once subjected to. An overwhelming 43% of crimes reported by Indian women are acts of cruelty committed by their own families. Millions of Indians -- men and women -- are complicit. The discrimination continues at a policy level: marital rape is still not considered a crime in India. Local governments and police remain poorly equipped to process crimes against women -- let alone doing so in a sensitive manner. So why are many shocked by India's abysmal statistics on crimes against women? The crimes, as always, begin at home. It should be no surprise to read about the physical crimes reported and recorded by the National Crime Records Bureau. What is surprising is how generations of Indians have stood by as their mothers, sisters, and daughters have been left behind on every indicator of quality of life; they have been denied the chance for basic equality. The WEF report makes for illuminating reading, and signposts where India needs to go to fully realize the potential of its 600 million female inhabitants.

"The U.S. Department of Education announced recently that it is investigating 55 universities and colleges for their failure to properly handle sexual assault cases on campus. The list includes a number of prestigious institutions, including Harvard, Emory, UVA, William and Mary, Tufts, the University of Michigan, and my alma mater, Princeton, where a 2008 university survey found that one in six women students had experienced nonconsensual sexual contact while enrolled. As a young alumnus, I feel a grim satisfaction at seeing my alma mater on the list. By the time I graduated, in 2009, two of my close friends and one of my former roommates had been sexually assaulted during our four years on campus, and I had watched another friend go through the labyrinthine and largely ineffective student disciplinary process in an attempt to see her rapist held accountable. Like so many other survivors of campus assault, she was discouraged from reporting to the police, and her case was instead handled internally, away from real law enforcement. This is, of course, part of the problem: If there's no real punishment for sexual violence, assailants know they can get away with it, and survivors won't report it. And if survivors don't report, universities can plead ignorance. When it came to sexual violence, it seemed that Princeton's priorities were misplaced -- it was more interested in preserving the university's reputation than ensuring the safety of the students. This is not to say that, within these institutions, there are not well-meaning individuals who work hard to keep students safe. But a few individuals can only do so much when they're up against an institution whose primary goal seems to be to protect the university's good name, even if that means providing cover for students who do terrible things. So far, Princeton has not commented on the Department of Education's investigation. With so much at stake -- money, prestige and reputation -- on the line, it should not surprise us if Princeton, like the 54 other institutions on the Department of Education's list (and the numerous other at-fault schools, like Yale, that have, for now, avoided censure) do their best to explain away accusations that for years, they've allowed their students to get away with sexual assault or rape. One survey of two universities estimated that female students had a one in five chance of being sexually assaulted during their undergraduate years. By failing to protect their students and not properly disciplining assailants, universities are in violation of Title IX of the 1972 Education Amendments. Title IX, so often associated with athletic funding, also requires universities receiving federal funding to provide equal access to education for all students, regardless of gender. University administrators are falling short if they allow a culture of sexual violence to flourish. Thanks to the tireless efforts of young activists -- like the students and recent graduates who founded the Know Your IX campaign -- this issue is finally getting more attention. A new White House task force has released policy recommendations for campuses (and two star-studded PSAs) and the Department of Education has stepped in. The Obama administration's strong support for survivors of campus assault -- not just the usual platitudes and policy band-aids -- is a crucial step in the right direction. But other stakeholders -- namely alumni and parents -- need to join this fight as well. In June, alumni of all ages will be heading back to their alma maters for college reunions -- an exercise of school pride and, in many cases, hefty alumni donations. At Princeton, the event is a three-day booze-soaked party of self-congratulation, and a chance to celebrate ""the best damn place of all."" If alumni, in good conscience, want to wear school gear or stick school bumper stickers on their cars, they must take on the issue of campus sexual assault. To do that, they will need to speak the language that these institutions understand: Money, and press. If alumni with the power to pull large donations refused to give money to their universities until sexual assault is taken seriously, we'd see an immediate change on campuses. Similarly, if parents were vocal about their concerns at sending their kids to a place where they might very well be assaulted or raped, or spend four years being covertly (and overtly) told that committing rape is acceptable, universities would scramble to improve and, more to the point, enforce, their policies. Ultimately, efforts to prevent sexual violence on college campuses have to be motivated by something beyond a desire to protect a university's bottom line, or to avoid negative press coverage. Universities have to be motivated by the sincere belief that all students have a right to an education not marred by fear of violence or memory of violence, and by a deep and genuine investment in the safety of all students. As it stands, the words we hear from some of our nation's top universities don't match their actions. They have spent years letting down students, parents, and alumni, by making it easy for their students to commit assault or rape. It's time to hold them accountable.","Government will investigate 55 universities and colleges on sexual assault cases .

"At least 40 people in northern Nigeria were killed Wednesday in two suicide blasts targeting a renowned Muslim cleric and an opposition politician, prompting a round-the-clock curfew to prevent chaos. ""We have recorded two suicide blasts today in the city, which have killed 40 people,"" Kaduna State Police Commissioner Umar Shehu said of the blasts that also injured scores of people. Twenty-five people were killed in the first blast, which targeted the motorcade of Sheikh Dahiru Bauchi, the revered leader of the Tijjaniyya Sufi order in Nigeria, after he left the finale of an annual Koranic conference. The second blast occurred about two hours later and killed at least 15 people, officials said. It targeted Muhammadu Buhari, the former military ruler and opposition presidential candidate in the 2007 and 2011 elections. Both targeted figures escaped unhurt. Nigerian President Goodluck Ebele Jonathan condemned the bombings and ""commiserates with all those who were injured in the twin bombings in this holy month of Ramadan, which defy the tenets of Islam,"" adviser Reuben Abati said. U.S. State Department spokeswoman Marie Harf said America ""deplores today's twin bombings in Kaduna, Nigeria, which targeted Shaykh Dahiru Usman Bauchi, one of the country's most respected Muslim scholars, during the month of Ramadan."" She added that reports cited how former head of state Buhari may have also been targeted. Kaduna Gov. Mukhtar Ramalan Yero imposed a 24-hour curfew on the city of Kuduna ""to enable security agencies (to) restore normalcy,"" spokesman Ahmed Maiyaki said.

"With the intent of undermining the market for illegal drugs, Uruguay's government presented a bill to lawmakers that would legalize marijuana under a government monopoly. The government of President Jose Mujica has argued that the war on drugs has failed, and that separating the market for marijuana from the market for harder drugs will have social and health benefits. The bill was presented to congress on Wednesday, and includes no details of how legalization would be cultivated, regulated or sold. But it makes it clear that the government would be the sole manager of the ""importation, production, acquisition ... commercialization and distribution of marijuana or its derivatives."" The idea was first announced in June, and at the time there were reports that such a law would require onerous identification and tracking requirements that consumers would object to. Read more about how Brazil is fighting the war on drugs . The bill does not mention any requirements, presumably leaving it up to the congress to fill in the details. Diego Canepa, pro-secretary of the presidency, said that current laws criminalizing the private sale of marijuana would remain in place, and campaigns warning of dangers of drug use would continue. ""No one is saying that marijuana is good. What is happening is that the foundation of the type of policy that we have followed for more than 50 years in this country have not had the expected results, and the worst thing that can happen to public policy is to not act when the evidence shows that persisting on the same path will not obtain different results,"" he said. Consumption of marijuana is already legal in Uruguay, Canepa said. If passed, the law would make Uruguay the first country to produce and sell marijuana to its citizens. While the bill itself was short on details of how such a system would actually work, it was accompanied by a 12-page letter that carefully laid out the argument for passage of the bill. The goal is to create a government-run market that would ""contribute to the reduction of risks and potential dangers that people who use marijuana for recreation or medical reasons face."" Read: Is Puerto rico the forgotten front in America's drug war? Marijuana users put themselves in dangerous situations in the course of acquiring the substance, and expose themselves to other drugs that are more addictive and dangerous, the letter states. The letter traces the history of drug use to pre-Columbian times, but focuses on the drug war of the last 50 years. The war on drugs has failed and had consequences that are worse than the drugs themselves, the letter states. As evidence, the Uruguayan government points to a report last year by the Global Commission on Drugs, a body made up of several former presidents and other luminaries, who concluded that the war on drugs has failed to accomplish the goals it set. Uruguay will not abandon its policy of combating drugs, but will do so through education of the harmful effects, rather than criminalization for marijuana, the letter states. Marijuana is the most commonly used illegal substance in Uruguay, and drug traffickers net $30-40 million annual from the black market, the government said.","The Uruguayan government presented lawmakers with a bill this week .
It would allow the government to control and sell marijuana .

"(CNN) -- At first glance the Eurovision Song Contest may seem like any old talent show. Singers perform live on TV, the public and special juries vote, and at the end of the night a star is born. But don't call this ""X Factor"" or ""American Idol"". This is reality TV on steroids. Every year around 40 nations from Spain to Azerbaijan field a musical act, each singing an original song in front of a huge television audience. As part of the European festival of kitsch, some contestants sashay across the stage in barely-there dresses, and shriek into wind machines with the force of hurricanes. Pyrotechnics, fire, and massive LED screens are de rigeur. It's a big draw. In 2013 more than 180 million viewers in 45 countries tuned in to the action. This year's final takes place on May 10 in Copenhagen, Denmark. Although officials describe Eurovision as a non-political event meant to unite Europe through song, politics inevitably colors the voting and the performances. William Lee Adams, a Eurovision expert and the editor-in-chief of Wiwibloggs.com, the popular Eurovision website, has been in Denmark for the buildup since late April. ""Eurovision is about music, but it's also about identity and nation branding,"" he says. ""The artists and their songs become symbols of the countries they represent."" This year is no different. Tensions over Crimea are already coloring the perception of acts from Russia and Ukraine. During the semi-finals on May 6, some of the audience inside Copenhagen's B&W Hallerne booed the Russian act, a pair of 17-year-old twins called The Tolmachevy Sisters. ""Months of frustration over Russia's illegal annexation of Crimea and Putin's anti-LGBT laws have left Europeans angry,"" Adams says. ""The booing was a release, a statement of solidarity with Ukraine and Russia's sexual minorities."" It doesn't help that Russia's love song features lyrics that some see as hinting at a border incursion: ""...living on the edge, closer to the crime, cross the line, one step at a time...maybe there's a day you'll be mine."" In the past, Russia has relied on support from voters in the former Soviet bloc. Those votes seem less certain this year. Russia's loss could be Ukraine's gain. Mariya Yaremchuk, this year's Ukrainian act, will sing a song about love called ""Tick-Tock."" Her act features a man running inside a giant hamster wheel. The act is not explicitly political, but in press conferences Yaremchuk has stressed that her goal is to show that art is stronger than politics, and that music lasts longer than warring politicians. It's not all about Russia and Ukraine. During the semi-finals, the act from Poland featured women in traditional dress churning butter and washing clothes as a woman rapped about Slavic women: ""Cream and butter taste so good /We will prepare for you delicious food/ Our beauty is famous all over the world/ You gotta see it for yourself and then you will know."" ""Poland, one of Eastern Europe's economic success stories, is celebrating its 10th anniversary in the European Union,"" Adams says. ""Their song is a brilliant parody of Polish stereotypes, and a rebuke to all those who view Poland as backwards and behind-the-times."" In the past officials have disqualified songs with explicit political messages. In 2009, the Republic of Georgia was forced to pull its entry ""We Don't Wanna Put In."" It was a clear poke at Russia's President Vladimir Putin in the wake of the 2008 South Ossetia War. Creative license allows other songs with political messages to slip through. In 2011 the Portuguese entry, which translated as ""The Struggle is the Joy,"" was a call for Portuguese to fight against the government's planned austerity measures. It became an anthem of protest during the financial crisis. Political leaders, particularly those in the East, see the Eurovision results as a matter of international standing. Last year, when Azerbaijan failed to give any points to its political ally Russia, the Azeri president ordered a vote recount and the foreign ministers of two countries convened a meeting in Moscow. Riding a wave of sympathy, Ukraine has emerged as one of the bookies favorites to win this year. That won't sit well with authorities in Moscow. Nor will the reality that televoters in Crimea may still be counted as Ukrainian by their mobile phone companies. ""When the points are counted and the hair extensions come off, one government is going to be very disappointed,"" Adams says. ""This isn't just a song contest. It's a battle in the war.""

"It's a statistic we've been hearing far too often -- and for far too long. Two-thirds of American adults are either overweight or obese -- and the problem is only getting worse. Even Coca-Cola, the world's largest beverage company, is now calling obesity ""the issue of this generation."" The world's most valuable brand took the last seat at a crowded table Monday, when it launched an ad campaign aimed at ""reinforcing its efforts to work together with American communities, business and government leaders to find meaningful solutions to the complex challenge of obesity."" The first commercial of the campaign, a two-minute video called ""Coming Together,"" begins with a voice-over: ""For over 125 years, we've been bringing people together. Today, we'd like people to come together on something that concerns all of us: obesity."" The spots are scheduled to run on television, including CNN, beginning this week. Coca-Cola points out in the video it offers 180 low- and no-calorie beverages out of more than 650 beverage products. Coke has come under increased fire over the past year as a predominant target of an anti-obesity crusade, led in large part by the Center for Science in the Public Interest, also known as the CSPI. Appearing on CNN's ""Sanjay Gupta MD"" in October, Michael Jacobson, executive director of the CSPI, conceded that sugar and soda consumption are, in fact, on the decline. ""But,"" he said, ""the scientific community has ... reached a consensus that soft drinks are the one food or beverage that's been demonstrated to cause weight gain and obesity. And if we're going to deal with this obesity epidemic, that's the place to start."" Global report: Obesity bigger health crisis than hunger . The CSPI came out swinging in October, introducing ""The Real Bears,"" -- ""an animated short film that encourages Americans to pour out their sodas."" It stars ""The Real Bears,"" which resemble the iconic Coca-Cola polar bears. The video was directed by Alex Bogusky, the man behind the anti-tobacco ""Truth"" campaign, and features an original song, ""Sugar,"" by Grammy award-winning artist Jason Mraz. In response, Coca-Cola issued a statement that read: ""This is irresponsible and the usual grandstanding from CSPI. It won't help anyone understand energy balance, which is key according to recognized experts who've studied this issue -- a group that doesn't include CSPI. Enough said."" In its new campaign, Coca-Cola drives home the sentiment that ""beating obesity will take action by all of us, based on one simple, common-sense fact: All calories count, no matter where they come from. ... And if you eat and drink more calories than you burn off, you'll gain weight."" The reason soda and other sugary drinks have found their way to the forefront of the so-called ""war on sugar"" is the harmful rate at which they are absorbed, said Dr. Robert Lustig, a pediatric endocrinologist at the University of California, San Francisco, as well as the author of the new book, ""Fat Chance: Beating the Odds Against Sugar, Processed Food, Obesity, and Disease."" ""The reason to eat your sugar as whole fruit and not juice (or soda) ... is because the fiber helps reduce the rate of absorption from the gut into the bloodstream,"" Lustig says. ""When you juice it, it's all going to you and your liver gets overwhelmed and you get sick."" Opinion: Lustig: A fast-food, sugar fiasco . CSPI, in a statement Monday, said the new Coke ad campaign is ""just a damage control exercise, and not a meaningful contribution toward addressing obesity."" ""What the industry is trying to do is forestall sensible policy approaches to reducing sugary drink consumption, including taxes, further exclusion from public facilities, and caps on serving sizes such as the measure proposed by Mayor (Michael) Bloomberg."" On September 13, Bloomberg, the New York mayor, won health board approval of a proposal to ban the sale of sugary drinks in containers larger than 16 ounces in restaurants and other venues. In an exclusive interview with Gupta after the board's approval of the ban, Bloomberg stressed the importance of portion control. ""I can tell you -- and I think I speak for almost everybody -- if it's in front of me, I eat it,"" said Bloomberg. ""I love Cheez-Its. If you put a 2-pound box of Cheez-Its in front of me, I'd probably eat them all. That's not very good for you. But if you eat (almost) anything in moderation, there's no harm."" Jacobson told Gupta that the occasional soda could, of course, be a part of a healthy diet. ""We don't want to wipe out soft drinks,"" he said. ""But we would like to see soft drinks return to the dietary role they played in the '50s, which was occasionally, and small portions, (as a) special treat. Now, people are guzzling huge containers of soda every day of their lives, practically."" Opinion: Forget large sodas, how about banning French fries? This is something even Coca-Cola can agree is a bad idea. The company is in the middle of a roll-out of smaller, portion-controlled sizes of its most popular drinks, and promises to have them in about 90% of the country by the end of the year. ""We've never been more committed to doing our part to help address the issue of obesity,"" Coca-Cola spokesman Ben Scheidler said in an e-mail, adding that ""2013 is going to be a landmark year in terms of expanding partnerships and efforts to educate consumers about energy balance."" But perhaps most important is a move Coca-Cola has already made: the decision to add the calorie counts to the front of their bottles and cans, to make it even easier for consumers to make informed decisions.","In a new ad campaign, Coca-Cola calls obesity ""the issue of this generation""

"An American sentenced in North Korea ripped up his visa so he could go to prison and expose human rights violations there, state media said Saturday. Matthew Todd Miller was convicted of committing ""acts hostile"" to North Korea and sentenced to six years of hard labor last week. Saturday's report in the state-run Korean Central News Agency boldly heaped blame on Miller, claiming his acts were a preconceived plan to gain notoriety. The 24-year-old from Bakersfield, California, arrived in North Korea as a tourist in April. After his arrival, he tore his visa at  Pyongyang's airport and  shouted his desire to seek asylum, according to KCNA. 'Rudely behaved' State media described him as ""rudely behaved,"" saying he was sent to infiltrate prison as part of a United States campaign against  North Korea. ""He perpetrated the above-said acts in the hope of becoming a world famous guy and the second Snowden through intentional hooliganism,"" state media said. Edward Snowden got asylum from Russia, where he fled last year after leaking classified U.S. government  documents. Once sentenced, Miller hoped to meet  Kenneth Bae, another American detained in North Korea. He planned to secure Bae's release so both can serve as ""witnesses"" to the human rights violations in the nation, state media said. ""The crime committed by Miller Matthew Todd was prompted by his sinister political aim to deliberately slander the DPRK,"" it said. DPRK refers to North Korea's official name, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. Its government is a communist dictatorship renowned for human rights abuses. Washington demands release . The  U.S. State Department has demanded that North Korea release Miller and Bae, and American Jeffrey Fowle. Fowle, 56, was arrested in June while traveling as a tourist. Bae, who was detained in 2012, has been accused of planning to bring down the government through religious activities. He was moved from a hospital to a labor camp. Miller talks to CNN . Earlier this month, Miller told CNN's Will Ripley that he ""prepared to violate the law of DPRK before coming here. And I deliberately committed my crime."" But Miller didn't elaborate on what his ""crime"" was. He said he wouldn't learn of his charges until he went to trial. It's unclear whether his statements were made freely or under coercion. First stop was South Korea . Miller's family lives in Bakersfield, and he is a 2008 graduate of Bakersfield High School, according to CNN affiliate KBAK. In a July interview, a neighbor told The Associated Press that Miller went to South Korea about four years ago to visit his brother and started teaching English. He traveled to North Korea this year after arranging a private tour through the U.S.-based company Uri Tours, which takes tourists into North Korea. Uri Tours has said it doesn't have ""any understanding of why"" Miller ripped up his visa. The company offers tours despite U.S. State Department warnings about arbitrary arrest and detention in North Korea.","State media: Matthew Todd Miller wanted to become ""a world famous guy""

"They were hiding in a place security officers called a ""safe area."" It was anything but. Outside an angry crowd grew, gunfire rang out and a fire blazed. Thick smoke blinded the three trapped men. The intruders banged on the fortified safety gate of the bunker-like villa. A security officer handed his cell phone to Ambassador Chris Stevens. Prepare for the mob to blast open the locks of the safety gate, the officer said. Security blog: Benghazi review critical of State's diplomatic security . It was a little before 10 at night on September 11, 2012. And time was running out for Stevens. Vivid new details of the attack on the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi, Libya, were released Tuesday night by a federal committee trying to come to grips with the violence that led to the first murder of a U.S. ambassador since 1988 and the deaths of three other Americans. The report spoke of grossly inadequate security, an issue that Stevens had complained about well before September 11. State Department resignations follow Benghazi report . The brief phone call . Instead of blasting their way into the villa, the crowd retreated for some reason. But the fire still blazed. Stevens used the cell phone to try to alert others about the attack. Struggling to see, choked by smoke, he dialed. Read more: Benghazi problems suggest long list of changes . He may have wanted to tell embassy officials in Tripoli that he and the small security detail at that 13-acre compound were in big trouble. They were outmanned, outgunned. The militants had doused a large area with diesel fuel and started a hideous fire. He may have wanted to say that he was trapped in a building they called Villa C with a security officer, and Foreign Service Information Management Officer Sean Smith. They had to flee to the villa after intruders stormed the walled-in consulate compound armed with machine guns and rocket-propelled grenades. But in that  9:50 p.m. phone call, Stevens could only tell the U.S. deputy chief of the mission in Tripoli that they were under attack. The call promptly dropped. Warning signs . Though fierce and sudden, the attack may not have been surprising for some. U.S. diplomats who worked in Libya, a country struggling to form a government after overthrowing longtime dictator Moammar Gadhafi, had repeatedly asked for more security. American officials, for the most part, were well-received in Libya, where many locals were grateful for the help the United States provided in overthrowing Gadhafi. But danger remained. Read more: State Department: Clinton not dodging Benghazi hearings . There were still many Gadhafi loyalists, there was easy access to guns and the new fledgling government was having a difficult time maintaining security. On June 1, a car bomb exploded outside a hotel in Tripoli where Stevens was staying. Read more: Benghazi talking points omitted link to al Qaeda . The same month, Stevens had to move with his security team from the hotel because of a ""credible' threat. On June 6, a roadside bomb exploded near the U.S. compound in Benghazi, hurting no one but blasting a large hole in a wall of the compound. The threats continued for U.S. officials and diplomats from other countries -- but security staffing remained unchanged. The ambassador is missing . But now, there was no time to fret about woeful security. Black smoke was filling up the safe area. Stevens, Smith and the security officer crawled to a bathroom, hoping to open a window. The security officer placed towels under the bathroom door and flung open the panes. It made things worse. The open window pulled more smoke into the bathroom, making breathing impossible. Despite the explosions outside, they would have to flee the safe area, the officer thought. The smoke had choked out the lights. They were in total darkness. The officer left the bathroom, crawled through a hallway, banging on the floor and yelling that the ambassador and Smith follow him. He slipped though another window and collapsed in an enclosed patio area. And then he noticed it. Stevens and Smith were not there. The officer slipped back through the window several times, even though the intruders were still shooting at him. The smoke and heat was unbearable. He could not find either man. He used a ladder to climb to the roof of the villa and radioed for help. He had been in the smoky room for so long he could hardly speak. It took some time for the officers on the other end of the line to understand what he was saying. He did not have Smith, he said. And the ambassador is missing. The battle at the Annex . Three other security officers had barricaded themselves in another building when the siege began. Once the first wave of attackers seemed to retreat, the officers got out of their ""defensive"" positions and drove an armored car to the villa. They found their colleague on the roof, vomiting, about to pass out. The three officers crawled through the smoke inside. Read more: Ex-CIA chief Petraeus testifies Benghazi attack was al Qaeda-linked terrorism . They found Smith. They dragged his body out. But they were too late. A team, from a nearby U.S. facility called the Annex, arrived and helped search for Stevens. They could not find him. Concerned that the large crowd of militants was about to overtake the entire compound, they decided to flee back to the Annex without Stevens. Men in the crowd began shooting, the bullets almost piercing the armored vehicle and blowing out two of its tires. They drove on. At least two vehicles followed them. They made it to the Annex, preparing for another fight. It was about 11:30 at night. Just before midnight, bullets began hitting the Annex. This started a gun battle that lasted for an hour. Hours later, another wave of attacks hit the facility with mortars, killing security officers Tyrone Woods and Glen Doherty. Finding Stevens . Hours passed and no one knew where Stevens was. About 2 a.m., the U.S. Embassy in Tripoli received a phone call. It was from the cell phone of the security officer who had given his phone to Stevens. The man on the line spoke Arabic, telling embassy officials that Stevens had been taken to a hospital in Benghazi. Officials could not determine what hospital Stevens was taken to. Some wondered if the phone call was a trick from militants who wanted to lure U.S. officers to their death. A Libyan official was sent to Benghazi Medical Center. He said Stevens was there. Hospital staff said six civilians brought Stevens to the emergency room about 1:15 a.m. Even though the ambassador showed no signs of life, doctors worked to revive him for 45 minutes. It was too late.","U.S.  Ambassador Chris Stevens was killed in September of this year .

"NEW YORK (CNN)  -- The pilot aboard U.S. Airways Flight 1549 came over the speaker system and told passengers ""brace for impact."" One passenger turned on his cell phone so his body could be found with its GPS tracking. Others reflected on their lives. iReporter Julie Pukelis used a camera and a telescope to get this view of the crash scene on the Hudson River. Survivors said it was about 20 seconds later when the plane struck the water of the Hudson River on Thursday afternoon. Each of them lauded the heroics of the pilot, Chesley B.

And then after that, there wasn't a lot of yelling and screaming. It was fairly orderly getting off the plane."" Valerie Collins . As the pilot announced the plane was going down, Collins grabbed her cell phone. ""I grabbed my phone and turned it on and got my husband's name and texted him, 'My flight is crashing,' because I wanted him to know I was thinking of him and, also, I didn't want there to be this, if it did turn out terrible, a time where he was trying to figure out if I was on there or not.""

"One-month-old baby girl Khushi, which means ""happiness"" in Hindi, would not have been alive had her mother, Sumanjeet, given in to pressure from some relatives and neighbors. ""They would cry and yell, 'What are you doing giving birth to a girl? Push her off the roof of the building, kill her! Why are you keeping her?'"" the 25-year-old mother says. Sumanjeet says people kept telling her to get an ultrasound check and abort all four of her daughters. They told her she wouldn't have enough money for a suitable dowry. Although Sumanjeet wasn't quite sure how she was going to raise them, she knew it was a crime to get rid of them. ""Why are they killing girls, while they're still in the womb? It's a sin for which they'll have to be answerable to God. Small, cute girls like a doll. They kill her in the womb? It's a sin,"" Sumanjeet weeps. The brutal gang rape of a 23-year-old student in New Delhi and the wave of outrage that followed brought to light the daily suffering of many Indian women. Thousands of people took to the streets to protest not just rape but the discrimination many women in India often have to live with throughout their lives. Opinion: India's rape problem needs a rewiring of society's attitude . A Thomson Reuters Foundation expert poll last year ranked India as the world's fourth most dangerous country for a woman, behind only Afghanistan, Congo and Pakistan. Even though the practice is outlawed, 300,000 to 600,000 female fetuses are aborted every year in India because of the preference for boys, according to a 2011 study by The Lancet. And the discrimination that begins while in the womb continues throughout a girl's life. Women's rights activist and Supreme Court lawyer Kirti Singh says there is a marked difference between how many parents treat their daughters and their sons. She says girls aren't given the same kind of food, they're not educated in the same manner, and they're only raised to become someone's wife. ""From the time they are born -- or not born -- and continuing till late in life when they become wives or mothers, it's a vicious cycle . of discrimination, and violence keeps on continuing."" Sumanjeet says she sees it all the time. ""They send boys to good schools, they give them good food, nice clothes to wear. They treat them well. They say, 'Oh, it's my son.' To the daughter they say, 'Get the cow dung, sweep the floors. What will you do with an education?'"" Read more: Lawyer urges not-guilty pleas in India rape case . Nearly half of India's girls are married off before the age of 18. Sumanjeet herself was forced to marry a man 15 years older than her when she was just 12 years old. She says she didn't object to the marriage, as she had barely understood what was going on. Girls are also seen as a financial liability. Once they get married, they leave the house and are often required to take hefty dowries along with them which sometimes can cost a family's entire savings. The practice is banned by the government, but it's still as common as ever. Once married, many women are subjected to domestic violence. A 2012 UNICEF study found more than half of Indian adolescent males think it is justifiable to beat a wife under certain circumstances. Opinion: Indian rape debate: Why death penalty is no solution . Outside the household, crimes against women in India are also on the rise, and the evidence is shocking. In July 2012, a young female student was molested and groped by a group of at least 18 men for 45 minutes in the northeastern state of Assam. People watched and filmed the incident, but no one helped. In September 2012, a 16-year-old student was gang raped by eight men, and her father committed suicide out of shame. Just 20 minutes from Jhajjar, a mother of four was allegedly dragged from her home and raped by five men just a month ago. She says they dragged her out of bed to a corner of the cowshed and took turns raping her. They only went away when her children woke up. But while the Delhi gang rape caught the world's attention, this case went unnoticed. ""The difference is that we are poor. We are not heard. When we go to the police station, they just do some formality. We are not being heard. We want justice,"" she said. One of the men she identified has been arrested, police said. The other got away. Read more: New Delhi rape exposes the perils of being a woman in India . According to government data, more than 24,000 cases of rape were reported in 2011. Most are never reported because of the stigma surrounding rape, but after the gang rape what was a taboo subject in India is now on the front pages and leading TV news. Indian women, in some ways, have also made some strides. Literacy rates have gone up, maternal mortality rates have gone down, and millions of women have joined the workforce. Leaders like the President of the National Advisory Council and the widow of the late Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi, Sonia Gandhi are role models who show that women can rise to great heights. But they are the exception. Authorities acknowledge that action is needed and say they are taking steps to try to better protect women. The Home Minister said India plans to recruit more female police officers. Currently only 7% of the Indian police force is female. Helplines have been set up and at least one state, Haryana, is soon putting up a website naming and shaming convicted rapists. A government task force has been set up to look into what more can be done to make Delhi safer. A number of fast track courts have also been established because of the December 16 gangrape, exclusively for cases of sexual assault and rape. But women's rights activists say that when discrimination begins even before birth, change will not come easily.","The brutal gang rape of a 23-year-old has brought to light the suffering of many Indian women .

"Everybody in the world will be on the Internet within seven years. That's what Google Executive Chairman Eric Schmidt said this weekend in public comments that inspired everything from excitement to incredulity. ""For every person online, there are two who are not,"" Schmidt wrote Saturday on his Google+ account. ""By the end of the decade, everyone on Earth will be connected."" He followed up with a related thought on Sunday. ""Think about how great the internet is with 2B users. Now think about how amazing it will be when 5B come online in a decade. #NewDigitalAge."" It's just the sort of big thinking that has led Google to become one of the largest and most innovative tech companies in the world. But some of Schmidt's own followers took exception.

About 38% of the world's population uses the internet in 2013, up from about 35% last year, according to the International Telecommunication Union, a United Nations agency dedicated to information and communication technology. With poor and developing nations around the world isolated by crumbling or nonexistent Web infrastructures, and others hindered by factors ranging from remote geography to government censorship, is Schmidt's vision overly optimistic? Maybe. But don't rule it out. As Business Insider's Julie Bort notes, there are some projects under way to bring everyone the advantages of the digital age. Google itself supports a project called Geeks Without Frontiers, a nonprofit group that donates computers and related technology to poor areas around the world. Focusing largely on Mexico, Central America and Africa, the decade-old group now aims to bring wireless access to regions with no traditional Web access. Samsung also is backing a project to turn old shipping containers into solar-powered, Web-enabled classrooms in places like South Africa and Sudan. The rise of the mobile Web is also sure to play a role. In Africa, more people have access to a mobile phone than have access to electricity. In South Africa, for instance, Google says, 25% of its searches during the week are via mobile devices, rising to 65% on the weekends. What do you think? Is Schmidt's vision farfetched?

"When no one wanted to build the world's tallest and fastest water slide, Jeff Henry built it himself. So when Verrückt was completed, and it was time to test the 168-foot coaster in his Kansas City, Kansas, water park, the choice of test riders was rather easy. The guinea pigs: Henry, owner of Schlitterbahn Waterparks and Resorts; Henry's assistant; and head designer John Schooley. ""It was terrifying,"" Schooley said. ""It was great fun, but it was actually terrifying."" The slide finally opened to the public on Thursday, July 10, after several weeks of delays. Technical glitches forced the original May 23 opening date to be pushed back three times, a park spokesperson said. Officially certified by Guinness World Records in May, Verrückt -- which is German for ""insane"" -- is  5 feet taller than the previous record holder, a water slide at a Rio de Janeiro country club. Verrückt is precisely 168 feet 7 inches tall. To put that free fall in perspective, it's longer than a plunge at Niagara Falls. Schooley stressed, however, that the ride is more than a single drop, calling it an ""extreme thrill"" without comparison. ""You have three or four experiences on the ride,"" he said. ""There is a 3-second free fall before you get launched into a weightless situation for a few seconds, and then you come down like a roller coaster and have a long splash down."" The origins of Verrückt are as extreme as the ride itself. According to Schooley, owner Henry was at a trade show and simply decided he wanted to build the tallest, fastest water slide at one of his five Schlitterbahn water parks. He immediately shopped the idea to vendors, who declined, but he refused to be denied. ""He decided to build it himself,"" Schooley said. ""We have long experience in building water park rides and developing new technology. Our park in Kansas City doesn't have a height restriction so we decided to put it right here."" Top 10 U.S. water parks making a splash . Officials say top speeds on Verrückt will reach 40-50 miles per hour, slightly slower than originally anticipated. The ride's rafts have also been scaled back from four-person rafts to three-person rafts. ""We always ride our rides first,"" Schooley said. ""And we found out it was too steep and too short.

"Rawalpindi, Pakistan (CNN)A suicide bomber detonated explosives outside a Shiite Muslim mosque in the northern Pakistani city of Rawalpindi on Wednesday evening, officials said, killing at least two people in what is the third such deadly attack in Pakistan in three weeks. The attacker tried to enter the mosque during evening prayers at 6:45 p.m. but was stopped by a security guard, Islamabad police said. The bomber detonated his explosives outside the building, police said. The bombing killed two people and injured seven others, said Dr. Aisha Isani, a representative of the Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences, which was treating people injured in the blast. The militant group Jundallah claimed responsibility for Wednesday's attack, said a Jundallah spokesman going only by the name of Fahad. The spokesman said that the group attacked because of a months-long Pakistani military operation against the Taliban and other militant groups in the country's North Waziristan area, and that Jundallah would continue to target Shiite Muslims. North Waziristan is one of the northwestern Pakistan tribal areas bordering Afghanistan that have long been a base for anti-government militants. The Pakistani military campaign has displaced tens of thousands of people. Pakistan is a majority Sunni Muslim country. Shiites make up about 10% to 15% of the country's population, according to the CIA World Factbook. Jundallah also claimed responsibility for a January 30 bombing at a Shiite mosque in the southern Pakistani city of Shikarpur. That blast killed at least 48 people and injured dozens of others, officials said. On Friday, a suicide bombing and gunfire attack on a Shiite mosque in the northwestern Pakistani city of Peshawar killed at least 19 people, officials said. The Pakistan Taliban claimed responsibility for that attack. Journalist Adeel Raja reported from Rawalpindi. CNN's Sophia Saifi reported from Islamabad, Pakistan. CNN's Jason Hanna contributed to this report.","Jundallah militant group claims responsibility, blames a military offensive in North Waziristan .

"There are two Richard Shermans. There's the smart Stanford graduate who loves to read.  And there's the brash, trash-talker who considers himself the best NFL player. One is quiet, reflective. The other can be loud -- very loud. Much of America met the second Richard Sherman on Sunday night when, after making an amazing defensive play to seal the Seattle Seahawks' trip to the Super Bowl, he ranted in a postgame interview about his opponent. On Tuesday, we caught a glimpse of the first when Sherman showed up for a sit-down with CNN's Rachel Nichols for a mea culpa -- but not for long. ""I probably shouldn't have attacked another person,"" he told Nichols in an exclusive interview that will air in its entirety Friday night on CNN's ""Unguarded."" ""You know, I don't mean to attack him. And that was immature and I probably shouldn't have done that. I regret doing that."" But then, Sherman turned the spotlight on to him, making himself the victim, defending his actions and saying that what he regretted most was the way the media covered his rant. He also said he was shocked by some of the racists responses he received. ""It was really mind-boggling the way the world reacted,"" Sherman said.  ""I can't say the world, I don't want to generalize people like that because there are a lot of great people who didn't react that way. But for the people who did react that way and throw the racial slurs and things like that out there, it was really sad. Especially that close to Martin Luther King Day."" ""I learned we haven't come as far as I thought we had,"" Sherman added. ""I thought society had moved past that."" 5 things to know about Richard Sherman . The best in the game? Sherman, 25, has played in the NFL for three years after a standout career at Stanford. He was named an All-Pro the past two seasons at cornerback, a position where you often find yourself standing alone and defending against the fastest offensive players on the field. It takes a certain mix of bravado and confidence to excel at cornerback. And in Sunday's game, Sherman brought both. Sherman, who was defending 49ers receiver Michael Crabtree near the end of the tight contest, batted a ball to a teammate. That move ensured the Seahawks a trip to the Super Bowl. The crowd was beside itself. And so, it seemed, was Sherman. ""I'm the best cornerback in the game,"" he screamed during the post-game sideline interview. ""When you try me with a sorry receiver like (the 49ers Michael) Crabtree, that's the result you are going to get. Don't you ever talk about me."" Fox sideline reporter Erin Andrews asked, ""Who was talking about you?"" ""Crabtree,"" Sherman angrily responded. ""Don't you open your mouth about the best, or I'm going to shut it for you real quick."" Viewers were shocked. They're more used to hearing players offer up cliches about what it takes to win, and hand down  half-hearted congratulations to their opponents for being worthy adversaries. The bile flowed almost immediately -- tweets calling him a gorilla, an ape or a thug from the ghetto. ""Richard Sherman deserves to get shot in the (expletive) head. Disrespectful (N-word),"" said one, expressing a common refrain. Emotion and regrets . In his CNN interview, Sherman said it takes certain characteristics to become a successful football player. It takes intensity. It takes focus. And, he said, it takes anger. He said he was in that emotional state after the play Sunday. ""If you catch me in the moment on the field when I am still in that zone, when I'm still as competitive as I can be and I'm trying to be in the place where I have to be to do everything I can to be successful ... and help my team win, then it's not going to come out as articulate, as smart, as charismatic -- because on the field I'm not all those things,"" he said. Sherman said the vitriolic response surprised him. What he did was ""within the lines of a football field"" -- trash-talking an opponent but not hurting anyone, he said. The commenters, he said, were out of bounds. ""They had time to think about it,"" he said. ""They were sitting at a computer and they expressed themselves in a true way."" Getting to know Richard Sherman . ""But these people are acting like I attacked them in some way, like I went after them,"" he added. ""I did my job effectively.  And afterwards, they interviewed me and I had an interview.  Regardless of how that interview goes, it doesn't give you the right to say -- the things they were saying.  And that's the part that's sad."" All the way to the bank . There's no such thing as bad publicity, the saying goes. And to hear Sherman's agent tell it, the controversy has been good for him. Sherman's Twitter follower count has exploded in recent days. And the agent says his phone is ringing off the hook. ""Corporate America knows who Richard Sherman is,"" said Jamie Fritz, who manages Sherman's marketing deals. ""I talked to brand managers this week and they are fired up. They love it. They say this is real. This is true. We finally have a player who is willing to speak his mind."" But such exposure can be a double-edged sword, says Marc Lamont Hill, an associate professor of English education at Columbia University. ""He deserves all the marketing money he gets,"" Hill told CNN's Don Lemon. ""My concern though is when they use this image, will they see him as an extraordinary athlete who has a knack for talking trash or frame him as another angry, violent athlete?"" Fritz admits there are two Shermans: The one who stormed off the field, and the one he wants America to see. ""The amount of emotion, anybody who's played a competitive sport in a championship level knows what it's like to have those emotions running,"" said Fritz. ""Here's a guy who's never been arrested, never said a curse word in a post-game interview, and when you look at his body of work off the field and what he does for the community and charity, it's two completely different people.""

"At the last soccer World Cup, it was all about 3D.  This time around, it's nothing less than 4K. In 2010, FIFA was the driving force behind 3D television. The international soccer authority teamed up with Sony to bring fans 3D images of 25 matches from the World Cup tournament in South Africa. Back then, TV companies and broadcasters were hoping to follow the box office success of 3D movies. Even the Queen got into 3D, recording her 2012 Christmas message in 3D format. But the demand for 3D TV has not been as great as expected. Hollywood has fully embraced 3D technology. Around a third of all cinema screens globally are now 3D and the number of 3D film releases is growing steadily. But the glasses required to fully experience 3D have put off the small-screen viewers. Duncan Humphreys, of Stream TV Networks, said the special glasses clashed with the multi-screen experience many younger viewers demand. Many broadcasters have now scaled back on their 3D ambitions. BBC put its 3D TV project on hold for three years in last June, after saying the technology hadn't lived up to expectations. ESPN followed just a couple months later, closing its 3D channel down due to ""limited viewer adoption of 3D services."" Even FIFA has ditched the special 3D spectacles, betting instead on a brand new technology, 4K. The technology promises to offer viewing experiences four times clearer than high definition. A standard high definition television has a 1080p resolution, or more than 2 million pixels per frame. 4K TVs have more than 8.8 million pixels. FIFA and Sony are filming three full matches in 4K, and will also put out an official 2014 FIFA World Cup film in 4K once the tournament is over.

"Federal agents on Tuesday raided a South Florida office of Dr. Salomon Melgen, an eye doctor whose past issues with authorities had already entangled Sen. Robert Menendez. With yellow crime tape strung up outside, men and women lugged box after box of materials from Melgen's West Palm Beach office into awaiting minivans. Both members of the federal Health and Human Services department and the Federal Bureau of Investigation took part in the search, which FBI Special Agent Michael Leverock said was the second at the same Melgen clinic -- the other coming last January. ""As this is part of an ongoing investigation, (authorities have) no further comment/information at this time,"" said Leverock. That means no official details as to what authorities were looking for. Even if it has nothing to do with his record as a generous political donor, Tuesday's raid suggests Melgen's legal troubles and perhaps their negative impact on Menendez, the senior U.S. senator from New Jersey are far from over. Confessions show sex claims were 'false smears,' senator says . The doctor's lawyer contended that Tuesday's search was the government's way of getting back at Melgen, after he sued over Medicare payments. Even so, Matthew Menchel, the attorney, said that Melgen will continue to work with authorities. ""While we believe that today's intrusion was in retaliation and there was no legitimate need for the search, the FBI's actions will not prevent Dr. Melgen from continuing his full cooperation with the government,"" Menchel said. The doctor first came to the attention of many around Washington when The Daily Caller, a conservative website, published a report shortly before the November 2012 election citing several Dominican women who claimed they'd had sex with Menendez for money. The New Jersey Democrat staunchly denied the accusation. And in March, Dominican police announced three women had been paid to claim -- falsely -- that they had sex with Menendez. While that part of the story died down, the episode raised questions about why and how Menendez admittedly flew to the Dominican Republic three times in 2010 on Melgen's private plane. One of those flights was on official business, while two others were for private reasons. The now two-term U.S. senator -- following his re-election last fall -- personally paid Melgen approximately $58,500 for the flights, admitting he had failed to pay in more timely, proper payments because ""it unfortunately fell through the cracks."" Others have also brought up how Menendez raised concerns regarding a federal audit that showed Melgen had overbilled the federal government by $8.9 million in Medicare and Medicaid payments when treating patients. Melgen, his wife Flor and his daughter Melissa have been generous donors to Menendez, his fellow Democrats and related causes in recent years. Yet in an interview last spring with Bloomberg, Melgen insisted that he ""did not ask Sen. Menendez or any public official to intervene."" In the same interview, the doctor said he and Menendez had ""become like brothers, like friends,"" talking to each other every week and seeing each other once a month until the first news broke. The matter of Melgen's billing practices, meanwhile, has taken more twists and turns in recent months. The doctor sued the federal government in August related to his Medicare claims, with authorities asking to suspend his Medicare payments three weeks later, according to Melgen's lawyer. Just last Friday, Melgen filed a motion seeking an injunction to stop the government.","Federal agents raid Florida clinic of Dr. Salomon Melgen for the second time .
They don't say why ,but Melgen is being probed for Medicare and Medicaid billing practices .

"Burmese security forces backed by Buddhist monks have ""committed crimes against humanity"" in a campaign of ethnic cleansing that has displaced more than 125,000 Rohingya Muslims in the southwest of the country, according to a new report from Human Rights Watch. The report comes as the European Union was due to meet this week to decide whether to lift sanctions on Myanmar, the South East Asian country also known as Burma. The Rohingya are a stateless Muslim minority living in Rakhine -- thought to number between 800,000 and one million -- who claim they have been persecuted by Myanmar's military during its decades of authoritarian rule. Though many Rohingya have only known life in Myanmar, they are viewed by Rakhine's estimated three million Buddhists as intruders from neighboring Bangladesh. The rights group interviewed more than 100 people on both sides of the conflict following sectarian violence in Arakan state in 2012 in which more than 180 people were killed, and concluded that the violence had been tacitly sanctioned by the Burmese government and its security forces. ""The absence of accountability against those to blame lends credence to allegations that this was a government-appointed campaign of ethnic cleansing in which crimes against humanity were committed,"" the report stated. Witnesses described how security forces stood by or joined in with Arakanese men wielding machetes, swords, homemade guns and Molotov cocktails as they descended on villages in what appeared to be a coordinated series of attacks on townships over a wide area of the state. HRW said that satellite imagery from just 5 of the 13 townships attacked since June showed destruction of 4,862 structures across 348 acres of mostly Muslim-owned residential property. In the worst incident at Yah Thei village on October 23, 2012, witnesses told HRW how security forces aided local mobs by disarming Rohingya of the primitive weapons they were carrying to defend themselves. During the daylong attack, at least 70 Rohingya were killed including 28 children of which 13 were aged under five. ""First the soldiers told us, 'Do not do anything, we will protect you, we will save you', so we trusted them,"" a 25-year-old Rohingya survivor told Human Rights Watch. ""But later they broke that promise. The Arakanese beat and killed us very easily. The security did not protect us from them."" The rights group blamed local Buddhist monks and the two-year-old nationalist Rakhine Nationalities Development Party (RNDP) for encouraging and orchestrating the violence. Between June and October, according to the report, these and other ultra-nationalist groups issued pamphlets and public statements demonizing Rohingyas, at times using the phrase ""ethnic cleansing."" ""During the first wave of violence in June security forces not only stood by and watched as Muslim communities were being attacked but in some cases they directly participated in those attacks,"" Matthew Smith told CNN from the Bangkok office of HRW. ""In the time between June and October (when the second wave of attacks occurred) there was a high degree of public organizing was taking place promoting ethnic cleansing in Arakan state. ""Public statements were released by monk's associations, political groups and others and the tensions were rising. The authorities did nothing to intervene, to promote peace and reconciliation, nothing to prevent further violence from occurring."" He said the government continues to blame ""communal violence"" when it knew about the attacks and could have prevented them, adding that authorities were blocking aid to displaced victims. HRW said Rohingyas in holding camps were at grave risk of lethal waterborne diseases if they were not moved to higher ground before the rainy season in May. ""There are tens of thousands of people being denied adequate humanitarian aid and the responsibility for this falls squarely on the government,"" Smith said. While HRW acknowledged that local Buddhist Arakanese had also been displaced by the violence, the burden of the humanitarian disaster had fallen on the Rohingya population who have suffered decades of abuse under discriminatory Burmese citizenship laws. Myanmar does not recognize them as citizens or one of the 135 recognized ethnic groups living in the country. ""Some Arakanese have suffered greatly in this situation,"" Smith said. ""In June, there was violence perpetrated by both Rohingya Muslims and Arakanese Buddhists although it was there was a much smaller level of displacement among the Arakanese community. ""For example, Buddhist monks in Mrauk-U explained to me how at least 16 Arakanese Buddhists had died in the violence in the township."" He said that, for the most part, Arakanese Buddhists have resumed life as usual, attending to their fields, going to tea shops and monasteries while Rohingya Muslims are still subject to abuse from security forces and live under an active policy of segregation and containment within the government's camps. ""There is a serious concern that the government will not take seriously the right of these displaced people to return to their homes,"" Smith said. But Myanmar presidential spokesman Ye Htut accused HRW of timing its report to coincide with the EU sanctions decision. ""The government will not pay attention to such a one-sided report,"" he said in comments posted on his Facebook page. Last month, Myanmar's President Thein Sein placed the city of Meiktila in the region under a state of emergency as sectarian strife simmered. The president said some were exploiting the situation to engineer violence in other parts of the country. ""I would like to warn all political opportunists and religious extremists who try to exploit the noble teachings of these religions and have tried to plant hatred among people of different faiths for their own self-interest: Their efforts will not be tolerated,"" he said.","Human Rights Watch accuses Myanmar of tacitly supporting violence against its Rohingya population .

"The terrorist attacks in Volgograd on December 29 and 30 are an ominous sign that the decision to hold the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi may lead to one of the greatest catastrophes in the history of the Olympics. Many of the 120,000 persons expected to visit the Olympics do not realize that they are walking into what effectively is a war zone. The inability of the Russian authorities to prevent attacks was on display in Volgograd, a key connecting point for those en route to Sochi. On December 29, a suicide bomber blew herself up in the entrance of the Volgograd railway station. Russian President Vladimir Putin responded with extraordinary security measures. The next day, on December 30, a suicide bomber in the same city blew himself up in a bus. New Year's Eve is the most important holiday in Russia but people in the major cities, including Moscow, are not in a celebratory mood. The social media is full of warnings not to use public transport. In Volgograd, the local police are being flooded with reports about supposed new explosions and a number of factories have requisitioned buses to transport their employees to and from work. In 2007, when Putin persuaded the Olympic Committee to choose Sochi, there were already powerful reasons to refuse. Russian representatives depicted Russia as a ""young democracy"" but political opposition had been suppressed and investigative journalists murdered. At the same time, the Islamist insurrection was growing in the North Caucasus, directly adjacent to the proposed Olympic sites. What tipped the balance in Sochi's favor was Putin's personal lobbying and a Russian offer of $12 billon in preparations, twice what was proposed by the other two candidates. The choice of Sochi was treated, in the words of Dmitri Chernyshenko, who organized the bid, as ""a key moment in Russian history."" The Russian authorities began pouring money into grandiose transport and construction projects. It is common for Olympic infrastructure to end up costing twice the initial estimate but in Russia it cost $50 billion, more than four times the initial estimate, with $7 billion in contracts going to one of Putin's childhood friends. Reality, however, was beginning to close in. Russia had contained the Chechen revolt by granting absolute power and unlimited funding to Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov. He managed to pacify Chechnya with the help of terror but the insurgency outside of Chechnya was growing. After the killing by Russian forces in 2005 of the Chechen separatist leader Aslan Maskhadov, power passed to Doku Umarov, a Chechen field commander who announced that he was beginning a holy war to create an Islamic state from the Black Sea to the Caspian. The number of deaths spiraled, particularly in Dagestan. In 2009, the Islamists turned to terror attacks in Russia proper. Umarov took credit for the bombing of a Moscow to St. Petersburg train in November 2009 in which 27 persons were killed, two suicide attacks in March, 2010 on the Moscow metro in which 40 persons were killed and the suicide bombing in January 2011 of the Domodedovo Airport in which 36 persons were killed and 160 injured. Visitors to the Sochi Olympics now face several dangers that would have been avoided had the Olympic committee chosen a different location. The first danger is from the terrorists. Despite a security zone around Sochi and a system of intensive identity checks, it is impossible to guarantee the security of Olympic visitors totally. Ahmad Kadyrov, the former president of Chechnya and the father of the present leader, was killed by a bomb that had been built into one of the supports of the Grozny stadium six months earlier. Terrorists can also attack transport hubs like Volgograd. In addition to the danger from terrorists, however, there is also a danger from the Russian forces. As past experience shows, in a hostage situation, the Russians will make no effort to spare innocent lives. In 2002, when terrorists seized a Moscow theater and took nearly a thousand persons hostage, Russian forces flooded the hall with poison gas killing 129 hostages immediately. In 2004, Russian forces attacked a school gymnasium in the southern town of Beslan full of hostages with grenade launchers and flame throwers killing 334 hostages, including hundreds of children. The war that former Russian president Boris Yeltsin launched in 1994 against Chechnya was supposed to be a ""short victorious war"" that would boost Yeltsin's sagging popularity. Instead, it set off a conflict that has been claiming victims for 19 years. Because of the irresponsibility of the Olympic Committee in indulging Putin's desire for a propaganda spectacular, the stage may now be set for there to be many more.","Deadly attacks in Russia's Volgograd put spotlight on security during Sochi Olympics .

"U.S. intelligence agencies fear Edward Snowden has achieved celebrity as a leaker and could be inspiring others to disclose classified national security information. One indication of that may be in new documents published this week by the Intercept, the website begun by Glenn Greenwald, who published Snowden's leaks. Government officials believe the documents, labeled ""Secret,"" came from a Pentagon-run computer network called SIPRnet that government agencies used to share classified information. Investigators are looking for the leak. Rep. Adam Schiff, a member of the House Intelligence Committee, called it the ""copycat phenomenon"" and noted it was a big concern. ""The degree that people have been lionizing Snowden, it encourages people to make a name for themselves by leaking,"" Schiff told CNN in an interview. Schiff said the issue has come up in intelligence briefings that he couldn't talk about. ""It's a concern we've discussed: That Snowden has become the model for other leakers,"" he said. Snowden inspired by others . Snowden has said that he was inspired by others who disclosed secrets, including Daniel Ellsberg, who leaked the Pentagon Papers in 1971. He also has said that he considered the former Army private, now called Chelsea Manning, a hero. Manning leaked hundreds of thousands of classified documents to the anti-secrecy group WikiLeaks on the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. Like Snowden is now by the Obama administration, Ellsberg was demonized at first by the Nixon administration. Decades later Ellsberg is widely praised for revealing the government's secret dealings in Vietnam and neighboring countries. Snowden, who has lived in exile in Russia for a year to avoid U.S. criminal charges, has encouraged others to come forward. In the year since his leaks on U.S. surveillance practices, the Obama administration has tried to improve security at the agencies handling the nation's secrets. NSA security tightened . The National Security Agency, where Snowden worked as a contractor, has tightened its computer security aiming to ensure no one can carry out a theft of the size of which was attributed to Snowden: 1.7 million documents. The Director of National Intelligence has issued rules across all related agencies to try to better track contact with the media. At the same time, the administration is bowing to countervailing pressure to limit how prosecutors pursue leak investigations. It is now reining-in aggressive tactics, such as declaring journalists co-conspirators with leakers and subpoenaing journalists to reveal sources. The spate of leak scandals stems in part from the government's move since the September 11, 2001, terror attacks to more broadly share information. Some of the 9/11 hijackers were being tracked by one or more federal agencies. But the failure to share information across various agencies is one reason why the 9/11 attacks succeeded, officials have said. Schiff said the lesson learned then was to ""break down the silos"" of information. That effort, perhaps went too far. ""Beginning with Manning, you see people having access to things they had no reason to access to,"" Schiff said. ""The pendulum is clearly swinging back in the other direction."" Millions get clearances . A recent GAO study concluded the Pentagon approved as many as 3.2 million people for access to secret and higher-level classified information between 2006 and 2011. Schiff said there were far too many people with security clearances. At the same time, he said the government's national security work requires some secrecy. Revealing the methods by which security agencies try to prevent terror could show terrorists how to evade detection and thereby increase the risk of a disastrous attack. Intelligence agencies are ""kind of damned if they do and damned if they don't,"" he said. Obama, Congress working on changes to NSA . Opinion: NSA and your phone records: What should Obama do?

"With combat operations in Afghanistan ending this year, President Barack Obama announced he plans for almost 10,000 American troops to remain in the country in 2015 if the Afghan government signs a security agreement. ""We will bring America's longest war to a responsible end,"" Obama said in the White House Rose Garden in detailing the strategy to have virtually all U.S. forces out of Afghanistan by the end of 2016 -- shortly before his presidency ends. The announcement offered something to proponents and opponents of a continued U.S. military engagement there after more than 12 years of war -- the longest in American history. Obama called for 9,800 U.S. troops to stay in Afghanistan after the end of 2014, along with some allied forces. The number would get cut roughly in half by the end of 2015, and a year later --  less than a month before Obama leaves the White House -- the U.S. military presence would scale down to what officials described as a ""normal"" embassy security contingent. A senior administration official told CNN that after 2016, the number of U.S. service members in Afghanistan providing embassy security and engaging in cooperative security efforts with the host government and military would likely number about 1,000. Currently, the United States has 32,000 troops there. Maintaining any forces beyond the end of 2014 -- when Washington and its NATO allies will formally halt combat operations -- depends on Afghanistan signing the security agreement rejected by outgoing President Hamid Karzai, Obama said Tuesday. Two candidates facing each other in next month's run-off election to choose Karzai's successor have indicated they will sign the security pact, Obama said. ""It's time to turn the page on more than a decade in which so much of our foreign policy was focused on the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq,"" he declared. Three conservative Republicans who generally oppose any reduction in the U.S. military's global posture criticized Obama's announcement as ""a monumental mistake and a triumph of politics over strategy."" ""The President came into office wanting to end the wars he inherited. But wars do not end just because politicians say so,"" said a statement by Sens. John McCain of Arizona, Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina. Obama, however, said Americans have learned it was harder to end a war than to start one, adding that ""we have to recognize Afghanistan will not be a perfect place, and it is not America's responsibility to make it one."" The role of U.S. troops in Afghanistan after this year will be aimed at ""disrupting threats caused by al Qaeda, supporting Afghan security forces and giving the Afghan people the opportunity to succeed as they stand on their own,"" he said. Tony Blinken, Obama's deputy national security adviser, told CNN that the United States will spend about $20 billion on the continued military presence in Afghanistan after 2014. Asked if such a cost was worth it, Blinken replied: ""We want to complete the job that we started."" At the same time, he said ""we can't be in an endless war posture."" In a call with journalists before Obama's announcement, senior administration officials said the intention was to show continued international support for Afghanistan as it transitions to its new elected government. The successful first round of voting showed Afghanistan forces now were capable of providing security, the officials said. The United States had as many as 100,000 forces in Afghanistan at one point. In all, more than 2,300 American troops have been killed in that war, launched in the weeks after the September 11, 2001, al Qaeda terror attacks on the United States. Obama's announcement came the day before he delivers a foreign policy speech at the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, New York. On Tuesday, he indicated the shift in resources permitted by ending the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan would allow increase counter-terrorism assets in Africa and elsewhere. Until now, Obama's administration has been reluctant to assign a number to American troop strength in Afghanistan once the combat mission ends. House Republican leaders reacted to Obama's announcement with encouragement for a continuing mission, but skepticism over the rigid time line. ""I'm pleased the White House met the military's request for forces in Afghanistan. However, holding this mission to an arbitrary egg-timer doesn't make a lick of sense strategically,"" said Rep. Howard ""Buck"" McKeon, the California Republican who chairs the House Armed Services Committee. House Speaker John Boehner, who has pushed for reaching a bilateral security agreement with Afghanistan to keep U.S. troops there, said he welcomed the plans for a continuing mission. ""It has been my long-standing position that input from our commanders about the conditions on the ground should dictate troop decisions, and not an arbitrary number from Washington,"" Boehner added in a statement.

"Chadian troops in Mali killed Moktar Belmoktar, a veteran jihadist who claimed responsibility for a deadly attack on an Algerian gas facility, Chad's armed forces said Saturday. Belmoktar led a group called Al-Mulathameen Brigade (The Brigade of the Masked Ones), which is associated with al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM). He was killed during clashes in northwestern Mali, Chadian armed forces spokesman Gen. Zacharia Goubongue said in a statement read on state-run television. U.S. officials said they could not immediately confirm the report. However, the chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee cheered the news. ""One of the most elusive and deadly terrorists in North Africa has been reportedly killed,"" Rep. Ed Royce, R-California, said in a statement. ""This would be a hard blow to the collection of jihadists operating across the region that are targeting American diplomats and energy workers. French and African forces are helping Malians shed militant Islamist rule."" In January, more than three dozen hostages died in the terrorist seizure of a natural gas facility in eastern Algeria and the subsequent special forces assaults on it, according to that country's prime minister, Abdul Malek Sallal. Belmoktar had said the attack was in retaliation for Algeria's allowing France to use its airspace to battle Islamist militants in Mali. But regional analysts believe the operation was too sophisticated to have been planned so quickly, and Sallal said the hostage scheme had been hatched over months. The veteran jihadist behind the attack in Algeria . Belmoktar, who lost an eye while fighting in Afghanistan in his teens, long had been a target of French counterterrorism forces. Born in 1972, Belmoktar grew up on the edge of the desert in southern Algeria. He traveled to Afghanistan in 1991 in his late teens to fight its then-communist government. He returned to Algeria as a hardened fighter with a new nickname ""Belaouar"" -- the ""one-eyed"" -- after his battlefield injury, and joined forces with the Armed Islamic Group (GIA) in its brutal campaign against the Algerian regime and civilians deemed to be its supporters. Belmoktar later claimed he met al Qaeda founder Osama bin Laden in the Sudan in the mid-1990s. According to Jean-Pierre Filiu, a French scholar who has extensively studied AQIM, Belmoktar rose steadily through the ranks to become the GIA commander for the Sahara. After a popular backlash against the terrorist group in Algeria, Belmoktar switched allegiance to a spinoff group in 2000 and continued to operate in the sub-Saharan region. The GIA was the forerunner of AQIM, which still counts many Algerians in its leadership. Belmoktar remained associated with that group -- but was very much his own man, analysts said. Abdelmalik Drukdal, the overall leader of AQIM, is said to have demoted Belmoktar late last year from his position as ""emir of the Sahel."" Belmoktar also feuded with a rival commander -- Abdelhamid  Abou Zeid -- one of the most violent and radical figures in AQIM. More than most al Qaeda affiliates, AQIM is divided into often competing groups. To make money, ""Belmoktar increasingly engaged in smuggling, earning the popular nickname 'Mr. Marlboro' ... he also was involved in the smuggling of drugs, weapons, and illegal immigrants,"" Filiu wrote in 2010. The report of Belmoktar's death comes just one day after a U.S. official said Abou Zeid had been killed by French and Chadian forces. The president of Chad said Chadian troops killed the commander, while French military sources said earlier that Abou Zeid, a deputy leader of AQIM, was killed in an airstrike in Mali late last month. Abou Zeid was one of the group's most ruthless commanders, having seized at least a dozen foreigners for ransom. At least two have been killed; several French citizens remain captive. ""He was a senior influential member of AQIM, and his death represents a significant blow to AQIM's efforts to use West Africa, and Mali in particular, as a safe haven,"" the official, referring to Abou Zeid, told CNN.","A U.S. lawmaker describes Belmoktar as one of the deadliest terrorists in North Africa .

"Former CIA Director David Petraeus is expected to tell House and Senate committees Friday that soon after the attack on the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi, Libya, it suspected Ansar al Sharia was responsible. But just what is Ansar al Sharia, and why wasn't it identified as a prime suspect two months ago? There is no easy answer. Ansar al Sharia is more a label than an organization, one that's been adopted by conservative Salafist groups across the Arab world. The name means, simply, ""Partisans of Islamic Law."" In Benghazi, Ansar al Sharia was one of many groups that filled the vacuum of authority following the overthrow of Moammar Gadhafi. Its members guarded the Al Jala hospital in Tripoli, where a number of the war's wounded were treated. For a while, the group provided security at the airport, according to Noman Benotman, a senior fellow at the Quilliam Foundation in London who has closely followed the evolution of the Libyan brigades. Ansar al Sharia took over a security building in Tripoli following Gadhafi's ouster and came up with a logo -- a pair of AK-47s, a clenched first and an open Koran. The group's central belief is that all authority is derived from the Prophet Mohammed, that democracy is un-Islamic and that other branches of Islam, such as the Sufi, are heretical. Ansar al Sharia and members of another brigade, dubbed the Libyan Shield, have been accused of destroying Sufi shrines near Benghazi days before the attack on the consulate. The description on the Twitter feed of Ansar al Sharia of Benghazi proclaims: ""The goals of Ansar al-Sharia brigade is to implement the laws of Allah on the land, and reject the human implemented laws and earthly made constitutions. There will be nothing ruling in this country other than the laws of Allah."" As with many of the brigades that roam Libya, Ansar al Sharia in Benghazi appears to have a fluid membership in the low-hundreds but some identifiable leaders, who have denied the group had any part in the consulate attack. In Benghazi, the membership includes Mohammed al-Zahawi and Sheikh Nasser al-Tarshani, its religious authority. Neither has been detained. Al-Zahawi -- who fought to overthrow Gadhafi -- has given a number of interviews since the September 11 attack on the consulate. In a BBC interview a week after attack, al-Zahawi denied Ansar al Sharia had any role in the attack, but said the group would not give up its weapons. ""We are in a battle with the liberals, the secularists and the remnants of Gadhafi,"" he told the BBC. Al-Tarshani told The Irish Times the attack was wrong. ""The killing of the ambassador was not intentional — he died as a result of suffocation,"" he told Mary Fitzgerald in a telephone interview. He also said that just because the assailants carried the black flag often associated with Salafist groups, it did not mean Ansar al Sharia was responsible. A CNN analysis of photographs of a large Islamist parade in Benghazi in June -- and similar shows of strength elsewhere -- indicates the flag is widely used by Libyan Islamist militia. Another prominent Ansar al Sharia figure is former Guantanamo Bay detainee Sufian bin Qumu. But his ""patch"" is east of Benghazi, near the town of Derna. In the wake of the September 11 consulate attack,  the 53-year old bin Qumu is thought by analysts to have left the area for a hide-out in the nearby coastal mountain range. Al-Tarshani told The Irish Times that the Benghazi group had nothing to do with him. Benotman, himself a former Libyan jihadist, thinks that blaming Ansar al Sharia for the attack oversimplifies the situation. He told CNN in September that its loose structure made it easy for any group with a terror agenda to infiltrate it because of a shared ideology. One such group, Benotman said, was the Imprisoned Omar Abdul Rahman Brigades, named for the blind Egyptian Sheikh imprisoned in the United States for his role in the 1993 attack on the World Trade Center. The group claimed responsibility for a crude IED attack on the Benghazi consulate in June. There does not appear to be organizational links between  Ansar al Sharia and al Qaeda, but there is solidarity. Al-Zahawi praised al Qaeda leader Ayman al Zawahiri in his BBC interview, and said al Qaeda's statements ""help galvanize the Muslim nation, maintain its dignity and pride."" Benotman said most people in Benghazi have little time for the Islamist brigades, as evidenced by the crowd of thousands who attacked Ansar al Sharia's headquarters in the days following the consulate attack. But he says their animosity was less ideological than borne of frustration. ""They felt the attack on consulate was a threat to their well-being. For many of the protestors, it's an opportunity to help the government make serious decisions to boost security in Benghazi,"" he said. U.S. unsure of Ansar role . The narrative from U.S. officials -- on the record and off -- about who was responsible for the consulate attack in Benghazi has been, at best, confusing. In part, that's because of the blurred lines and overlapping memberships of the different militia. On the day of the attack, a U.S. diplomatic cable sent from Benghazi described a meeting of several brigade commanders with U.S. officials two days earlier. According to the cable, during the meeting Libyan Shield commander Ben Hamed and another Islamist militia leader ""discussed the very fluid relationships and blurry lines they say define membership in the Benghazi based Brigades under the February 17, Libya Shield, and SSC [Supreme Security Committee, a Libyan government created fighting outfit] umbrellas."" Hamed and the other militia leader described themselves as members of multiple brigades, the cable said. Then there are the conflicting reports from U.S. officials. On September 18th, a U.S. official told CNN that Ansar al Sharia had not been positively identified as responsible for the attack, ""which is more likely to turn out to be a bunch of various elements and basically (al Qaeda) militants."" Another senior official told CNN: ""Ansar al Sharia is only one of the elements they are looking at. The notion that the intelligence community has zeroed in on either Ansar al Sharia -- its leader Sufian bin Qumu in particular -- is completely untrue."" At the same time, Matthew Olsen, director of the National Counterterrorism Center, told a congressional panel: ""We are looking at indications that individuals involved in the attack may have had connections to al Qaeda or al Qaeda's affiliates -- in particular, al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb."" The possibility that al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb was somehow involved in the attack was recently revived by U.S. Army Brig. Gen. Carter Ham, commander of the U.S. Africa Command. ""It appears to me very likely that some of the terrorists who participated in the attack in Benghazi have at least some linkages to AQIM,"" Ham told reporters in Paris this week. At other times U.S. officials have suggested that Libyan jihadists who fought with al Qaeda in Iraq played a role along with Egyptian militants. Little is known about who Libyan authorities detained in the wake of the consulate attack, and whether they are still detained. A Tunisian, meanwhile, has been detained in connection with the attack, though nothing is known publicly about his links to Ansar al Sharia. Ani Ali al Harzi was arrested in Turkey and is now being held in Tunis. What can be said with some confidence is that the Salafist trend has been revitalized across the Arab world as dictatorships have crumbled. A number of Ansar al Sharia groups have emerged not only in Libya but in Yemen, Tunisia, Egypt and Morocco. ""The Muslims today are not like they were before,"" al-Tarshani told the BBC. ""They cannot stand any action that would insult our Prophet or other symbols.""","Ansar al Sharia is one of a handful of militias operating in Libya .

"CLARENCE CENTER, New York (CNN)  -- Recovering all the bodies from Thursday's deadly passenger plane crash may take four days as investigators work through freezing temperatures and piles of wreckage, a federal transportation official said Saturday. Only a few pieces of the Continental Connection Dash 8 turboprop were recognizable after the crash. ""The medical examiner believes that three to four days are going to be required to recover the victims of this crash, and they're in the process of doing that,"" Steve Chealander of the National Transportation Safety Board said. ""They've already pulled some of the folks out of there, but they've got a long way to go."" All 49 passengers aboard Continental Connection Flight 3407 died when the 74-seat Bombardier Dash 8 Q400 turboprop crashed into a home in Clarence Center, New York, on Thursday night. A 61-year-old man in the house died also, but his wife and daughter survived. Fifteen bodies have been recovered, and efforts to identify the victims and conduct autopsies are under way, Erie County Health Commission Anthony Billittier said Saturday evening. A federal disaster mortuary team was called to assist local forensic officials. Despite reports from local authorities who said the plane hurtled toward the house from a sharp nosedive, Chealander said the current orientation of the plane indicates that it fell flat on its belly. The Continental flight from Newark, New Jersey, operated by Colgan Air, crashed about 10:17 p.m. Thursday northeast of Buffalo Niagara International Airport.  Follow the plane's path » . Chealander said the recovery effort and the investigation have been hampered by freezing temperatures as authorities try to sift through the wreckage of the flight and the home it struck. Some parts of the plane have fallen as deep as the basement, he said. ""Keep in mind, there's an airplane that fell on top of a house,"" he told reporters. ""The house and the airplane are together."" Authorities said it would probably take weeks to identify remains of the victims, with DNA testing required in many cases because of the intensity of the crash and subsequent fire. A 2-square-mile area around the crash site, about 6 miles from the Buffalo airport where the plane was headed, remained sealed off Saturday as investigators sought to determine the cause of the crash. But the extent of the restricted area belied the concentrated force of the impact into the one house.  Watch what investigators are saying » . Karen Wielinski was watching television inside the house when she heard a plane making an unusually loud noise. ""I thought to myself, 'If that's a plane, it's going to hit something,' "" she told Buffalo radio station WBEN. ""And next thing I knew, the ceiling was on me,"" she said. Wielinski and her daughter Jill, 22, were in the front of the home, and they escaped the house with minor injuries. Wielinski's husband, Doug, who was in the dining room, was killed. On Friday, federal investigators released information from the plane's cockpit voice and flight data recorders, indicating that icing may have been a major factor in the crash. The plane's pilot and co-pilot discussed ""significant ice buildup"" on the plane's windshield and wings as it descended toward the Buffalo airport. The plane underwent ""severe"" pitching and rolling motions after the landing gear was lowered and wing flaps were set for the approach, Chealander said. There was a mix of sleet and snow in the area, but other planes landed safely at the airport about the time the flight went down. Chealander said the flight crew reported that visibility was about 3 miles and there was snow and mist as they descended. The voice and data recorders indicated that the plane's internal de-icing was on during the landing approach, he said. ""A significant ice buildup is an aerodynamic impediment,"" he added.  Find out why » . Keith Burtis was driving about a mile from the crash site when he heard the impact. ""It was a high-pitched sound,"" Burtis said. ""It felt like a mini-earthquake."" A ball of fire filled the night sky as the jet fuel erupted, Burtis said, and he saw a steady stream of fire trucks rush past as smoke billowed. At least nine volunteer fire departments responded.

"Washington (CNN) -- Legalization of the more than 11 million unauthorized immigrants in the United States would raise wages, increase consumption, create jobs and generate more tax revenue, two policy institutes say in a joint report Thursday. The report by the Center for American Progress and the American Immigration Council estimates that ""comprehensive immigration reform that legalizes currently unauthorized immigrants and creates flexible legal limits on future immigration"" would yield at least $1.5 trillion in added U.S. gross domestic product over a 10-year period. ""This is a compelling economic reason to move away from the current 'vicious cycle' where enforcement-only policies perpetuate unauthorized migration and exert downward pressure on already low wages, and toward a 'virtuous cycle' of worker empowerment in which legal status and labor rights exert upward pressure on wages,"" study author Raul Hinojosa-Ojeda writes. The study looks at three scenarios: deportation of undocumented workers, temporary worker programs and legalization of the current undocumented population. Deportation would lead to a loss of $2.6 trillion in gross domestic product over 10 years, the report says, while a worker program would lead to a gain of $792 billion. Full legalization would lead to the best economic results, the study says. Other groups, such as the Center for Immigration Studies and the Federation for American Immigration Reform, say that unfettered immigration harms the United States and that entry into the nation must remain limited. When running for president in 2008, Barack Obama said that comprehensive immigration reform would be a priority in his administration, but the issue has been sidelined by health care reform efforts in Congress, the weak economy and the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. There are indications, however, that the Obama administration aims to revive immigration reform efforts in Congress this year. The study bases many of its conclusions on an examination of what happened after passage of the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986, which granted legal status to 3 million unauthorized immigrants. A 2006 Pew Hispanic Center report found that 56 percent of illegal immigrants in the United States in 2005 were from Mexico, a total of about 6.2 million unauthorized immigrants. About 2.5 million unauthorized migrants, or 22 percent of the total, came from the rest of Latin America, primarily from Central America, the Pew Hispanic Center study found. Of the remaining illegal immigrants, about 13 percent were from Asia, and 3 percent were from Canada and Europe, the Pew study said. The report released Thursday says U.S. enforcement efforts -- mainly along the nearly 2,000-mile border with Mexico -- are costly and ineffective. ""The number of unauthorized immigrants in the United States has increased dramatically since the early 1990s despite equally dramatic increases in the amount of money the federal government spends on immigration enforcement,"" study author Hinojosa-Ojeda writes. According to the report, the U.S. Border Patrol says its annual budget has increased by 714 percent since 1992, from $326.2 million in fiscal year 1992 to $2.7 billion in fiscal 2009. And the cost ratio of Border Patrol expenditures to apprehensions has increased by 1,041 percent, from $272 per apprehension in 1992 to $3,102 in 2008. Similarly, the Border Patrol says the number of agents along the border with Mexico has grown by 390 percent, from 3,555 in fiscal 1992 to 17,415 in 2009. ""Yet the unauthorized immigrant population of the United States has roughly tripled in size over the past two decades, from an estimated 3.5 million in 1990 to 11.9 million in 2008,"" the report says, noting that illegal immigration appears to have declined slightly since 2007 as a result of the global recession. The report points out that a long-term study conducted by the University of California, San Diego, found that 92 to 98 percent of unauthorized immigrants keep trying to cross the border until they succeed. Increased enforcement has several unintended consequences, such as making the Southwestern border more lethal by channeling migrants through remote and rugged mountain and desert areas, the study found. The number of border-crossing deaths doubled in the decade after increased border enforcement started, a 2006 Government Accountability Office report said. An October 2009 report by the American Civil Liberties Union of San Diego & Imperial Counties and Mexico's National Commission of Human Rights estimates that 5,607 migrants died while crossing the border between 1994 and 2008. Tightened borders also have created new opportunities for people smugglers, who charged an average $2,000 to $3,000 per person in 2006, the study said. Ninety percent of illegal immigrants now hire smugglers, according to the report. An examination of trends after the 1986 immigration reform law shows that legalization of unauthorized immigrants has benefits, the report says. Legalized workers earned more, moved on to better jobs and invested more in their education so they could get higher pay and better jobs. A previous study found that ""the wages of unauthorized workers are generally unrelated to their actual skill level,"" Thursday's report said. ""Unauthorized workers tend to be concentrated in the lowest-wage occupations; they try to minimize the risk of deportation even if this means working for lower wages; and they are especially vulnerable to outright exploitation by unscrupulous employers. Once unauthorized workers are legalized, however, these artificial barriers to upward socioeconomic mobility disappear."" Study author Hinojosa-Ojeda is founding director of the North American Integration and Development Center at the University of California, Los Angeles. The self-described progressive Center for American Progress is a nonpartisan research and educational think tank headed by John Podesta, who was chief of staff for President Bill Clinton. The Immigration Policy Center, established in 2003, also is a nonpartisan institute.

"Miami, Florida (CNN) -- Their stories were chilling: Students at a reform school recounted beatings and sexual assaults at the hands of school administrators and other employees who were supposed to be taking care of them. But a state investigation into the claims -- which date back to the 1950s and 1960s -- found insufficient evidence to prosecute any former workers at the Dozier School for Boys in Marianna, Florida. Results of the investigation, which was conducted by the Florida Department of Law Enforcement at the request of Gov. Charlie Crist, were released Thursday. The FDLE investigated allegations made by a group of men who said they were beaten and sexually abused when they attended the school about five decades ago. Read the FDLE's final report . State Attorney Glenn Hess told the FDLE he would not pursue any prosecutions in a letter dated February 25. ""The primary obstacles to bringing criminal cases based on events alleged to have occurred more than 40 years ago are the Constitutional rights to a speedy trial and to due process,"" Hess wrote. ""Florida's statute placing time limitations on prosecutions must also be considered. In a nutshell, citizens are protected from being prosecuted for crimes that occurred so long ago that preparing a defense would be difficult or impossible. The claims provided here are an example,"" he said. The allegations against school workers were made by a group of men -- now in their 60s -- who call themselves ""the white house boys"" after a nondescript white concrete building on the school grounds where they say the beatings and torture were carried out, often with a thick leather strap. One member of the group, Dick Colon, told CNN the outcome of the investigation shows ""Florida is running with a scam and everybody's behind it."" ""FDLE is whitewashing this thing like you wouldn't believe,"" said Colon, who was interviewed by the FDLE in the investigation. Colon said he was sent to the school for stealing cars, and went to the ""white house"" 11 times during his 30 months there, where he suffered unimaginable beatings. He remembers them as if they happened yesterday, he said. Colon said he was forced to lie face-down on a blood-soaked pillow that had small pieces of lip, tongue and skin from the previous boy's beating. He'd clench the metal bar of the bed as the strap struck him. ""After that tick, you'd go 'Aaaahh,' and then you'd grab that bar, and go 'Ooooohhhhhhh,' and the spindles of the bed would bounce, and sometimes the bed would come off the ground,"" Colon told CNN. The FDLE said its investigators interviewed six former staff members from Dozier and more than 100 former students and their relatives. But the agency acknowledged that most staff members who could have provided information have died. The report said there were inconsistent accounts from the men about various incidents, and a forensics examination of the ""white house"" building found no evidence of any blood. Most of the former students interviewed during the investigation agreed that a wooden paddle or leather strap was used for punishment, the report said, but there was disagreement about the number of spankings and the severity. ""There was little to no evidence of visible residual scarring,"" the report said. ""With the passage of over 50 years, no tangible physical evidence was found to either support or refute the allegations of physical or sexual abuse,"" it added. Hess cited another example in his letter, in which a former student said he had been sexually assaulted in a ""rape room,"" but then admitted he was not sure he had been raped. ""Time has blunted even the accuser's memory. Due process demands that the accused be informed of the charge he is to answer with specificity. These claims do not suffice,"" Hess wrote. Crist also asked the agency to look into 32 unidentified graves on the school grounds. Some of the accusers said the graves -- marked only by white steel crosses, rusted with the passage of time -- contained the bodies of boys who were beaten to death by school workers. But the FDLE investigation announced findings in 2009 that it had accounted for all the students. ""Enough information has been corroborated on who is buried there,"" Mark Perez, chief of Investigations for the FDLE, said in 2009. ""We went and identified all of the individuals who perished while in custody."" Colon said he reacted to the beatings and other events he witnessed by burying the pain inside. He also said another boy's terror has left him wrestling with his own best and worst instincts. He said he walked into the school's laundry room one day and saw a black teenager inside a large tumble dryer that was running. He wanted to save the boy, Colon said, and tried to talk himself into being brave. ""I said, 'Do it! Do it! Do it!' "" he recalled, his eyes brimming with tears. ""And then I thought to myself, 'If you do it, they're gonna put you in there. You're gonna be next.' And I walked away."" But the FDLE report said there were inconsistencies in the story and a lack of evidence. ""They have no evidence, they say, of any deaths?"" Colon said angrily. ""When I told them I came out and saw this black boy in the dryer -- did I witness a death or a goddamn birthday party?"" About 300 of the former reform school students sued former school administrators. The lawsuit was recently dismissed. ""We're attempting to move forward with a claims bill in the Florida state legislature to try and achieve justice for our clients,"" said Gregory Hoag, one of the students' attorneys. One of the men named in the original lawsuit is Troy Tidwell, a former reform school administrator, who still lives near the school grounds in Marianna. Tidwell refused to cooperate with the FDLE investigation, the agency's report said, because his cooperation could result in a criminal prosecution. Now in his 80s, Tidwell did give a videotaped deposition in the civil case last year. He said the boys at the school who misbehaved were ""spanked."" ""Never was a boy beat in my presence,"" he said. Tidwell's attorney did not respond to CNN's calls for comment. Colon says the FDLE's report about what happened at the school is wrong, and he wants to do his own investigation. ""We're going to get some ground-penetrating radar, and we have guys who will go and find the bodies,"" he said.","State finds insufficient evidence to prosecute ex-workers at Dozier School for Boys .

"If Cuban intelligence didn't do it, then Sen. Robert Menendez's legal team has a list of other theories about who was behind a prostitution smear that surfaced in 2012 as the  powerful senator ran for re-election. An April letter to the Justice Department lists a litany of possible conspiracies -- in addition to the Cuban spy caper -- behind the mysterious tip that alleged the New Jersey Democrat was a sex tourist who flew to the Dominican Republic to meet underage prostitutes. The letter from Menendez attorney Stephen Ryan to the Justice Department's public integrity section asks the department to investigate possible ""criminal activity intended"" to unseat him ""and to prevent him from becoming chairman"" of the Foreign Relations Committee."" Public integrity prosecutors are leading a corruption probe of whether Menendez violated the law in advocating for campaign donors. Ryan declined to make his letter public. But CNN reviewed a copy of it and verified its contents with three sources who have seen it. Cuban intelligence . The letter begins by raising the allegation, sourced to an unnamed ""senior government official,"" that Cuban intelligence agents may have been behind the smear campaign. But Ryan's letter also suggests the possibility of a conspiracy either -- knowingly or unknowingly -- between Cuban intelligence and Republican enemies of the senator. Among the other theories: That a former U.S. ambassador with a beef against Menendez was the tipster who called himself ""Peter Williams"" and who shopped the prostitution story to news outlets in Washington, a government watchdog group and to the FBI. New Jersey politics . Another more complicated theory offered in the letter, citing an unnamed witness: That GOP operative Roger Stone offered the story to the conservative news outlet Newsmax, which refused to publish it. The same witness allegedly claimed that Stone had a goal in mind -- to ensure Gov. Chris Christie could appoint Menendez's interim successor in the event he had to resign. ""Chris Christie is my ultimate client,"" the letter says the witness quoted Stone as saying. Ryan suggests ties to other New Jersey political figures who would want to help sink Menendez's campaign and notes: ""Governor Christie's connection to the fraud can be explained from a motive standpoint."" The letter makes no allegation that the governor was part of or even knew of the smear campaign. Stone denied the allegations in a telephone interview with CNN and called them ""patently false."" U.S. officials familiar with the matter told CNN earlier this week that the government was aware of the Cuban espionage allegations and had found no evidence to support it. The Cuban government-run website also dismissed any ties to Cuba. Corruption probe . The FBI's foray into the prostitution allegations dovetailed with a federal investigation focused on a Menendez donor in Florida, who for years has fought allegations that he overbilled Medicare. Investigators soon began looking into Menendez's relationship with the donor. Menendez's legal team believes the false prostitution story taints the entire investigation of the senator and wants it looked into further to see where it came from. ""This entire matter began with a campaign of lies to smear Senator Menendez to affect his election and the chairmanship of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and those lies included a fraud against the government,"" Ryan said in a statement. ""The Justice Department has the responsibility to investigate who committed that crime, so when I have received from credible sources information that merited further review, I have sent it to them. We don't know who was responsible for the smear against Senator Menendez, but it is my hope that the Justice Department will demonstrate some urgency in getting to the bottom of it. ""Whoever perpetuated this fraud against the government to smear a United States Senator and potentially influence U.S. policy should be held accountable to the full extent of the law,"" he added. Menendez weighs in . Menendez told CNN earlier this week that the Cuban intelligence involvement was plausible. ""Well, let's put it this way, for 22 years, between the House and the Senate, I have had a firm position in opposition to the Cuban regime that violates the human rights - the democracy of the people of Cuba,"" he said. ""I have been outspoken in that regard. And I wouldn't be surprised that the regime would do anything it can to stop me from being in a position that ultimately would impede their hopes of being able to get a different relationship with the United States based upon their interests, but not the interests of the Cuban people,"" he added. Important development . Additional content from the lawyer's letter matters because it casts new light on the Menendez legal team's efforts to force the government to reexamine the beginnings of their ongoing probe of the senator. The variety of theories offered -- and lack of proof to back them up -- doesn't indicate Menendez's legal team knows what gave rise to the prostitution story. Another letter Ryan sent to prosecutors in January didn't mention the theories. The April letter came at a time when the Menendez probe was intensifying, with investigators using a grand jury to issue subpoenas, according to people familiar with the probe. Any possible charges aren't imminent, according to these people. Should charges ever be brought against Menendez, Ryan's letter offers a glimpse of at least part of the defense team's possible strategy. By raising questions about the beginnings of the FBI probe, the defense could attempt to put the government's own investigation on trial. The letter also shows how a well-funded defense can try to complicate criminal investigations. It's common for FBI investigations to begin with dead ends before finding a viable prosecutable crime. But most defendants don't have money to pay for lawyers who can expose those dead ends, and try to make them a liability for prosecutors. The tipster, media coverage . The episode began in April 2012 when a tipster calling himself ""Peter Williams"" emailed the Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, a watchdog group, offering to supply evidence that Menendez was involved with underage prostitutes. CREW shared the information with the FBI. An FBI agent in Miami exchanged emails with the purported tipster, but the tipster appeared evasive in emails and would never agree to meet or talk with the FBI agent. After months of investigating, the FBI decided there wasn't any merit to the allegation. Reporters at several news organizations in Washington also looked into the allegations, also after receiving emails from a purported tipster, but didn't publish a story. Then in November 2013, the Daily Caller, a conservative website, ran with the story. By early 2013 the story began falling apart, and the alleged prostitutes who had claimed to be involved recanted their story. Menendez, who is of Cuban descent, won reelection and is now chairman of the Foreign Relations panel, which has given him a perch from which to thwart any Obama administration plans to relax economic sanctions to improve ties with the island's communist regime. For good measure, Ryan offers one more suggestion to the Justice Department: that a combination of Cuban intelligence tricksters and U.S. political enemies were behind the smear. He writes: ""We encourage the department to show some sense of outrage that a foreign intelligence agency operated by a government that has every reason to harm Senator Menendez to the U.S. has combined with dirty tricks political operatives to successfully use the Department to accomplish its goals.""","First on CNN: Possible conspiracies listed in letter to Justice Department .

"MIAMI, Florida (CNN) -- A man suspected of shooting four Miami-Dade police officers, one fatally, after a traffic stop Thursday, remained the subject of an intense manhunt Thursday night. Police say Shawn Sherwin Labeet is being sought after the shootings. Authorities pledged to work around the clock until Shawn Sherwin Labeet is captured. Local, state and federal agencies were assisting in the search, police Cmdr. Linda O'Brien said, and a Black Hawk helicopter was being utilized. ""We are continuing to pursue all leads until we find"" Labeet, said Miami-Dade Mayor Carlos Alvarez.  Watch a report on the manhunt » . A $22,000 reward was offered Thursday night for information leading to Labeet's arrest, O'Brien said. The shootings happened about 11 a.m. as the officers were on a burglary detail at a housing complex in Cutler Bay, Florida, Alvarez said. They saw a vehicle driving erratically, he said, stopped it and confronted the man police believe is Labeet. The man got out of the car and opened fire with an assault rifle, Alvarez said. ""Without any remorse, Labeet left the officers there to die and fled the scene."" The rifle used in the shooting was found at a nearby canal, but authorities say the man may have another weapon. Alvarez said the officer who died was 37 years old and survived by a wife and two young children. He had been with the department since 2003. A second officer, 31-year-old Jody Wright, remained hospitalized Thursday night. Her father, Dennis Dalley, told reporters she had undergone surgery as doctors tried to save her leg. He said he remains hopeful they will do so, but that will require many more surgeries. Dalley said Wright has been an officer for about a year and a half. The two other officers, ages 36 and 34, had been released from the hospital Thursday night, Alvarez told reporters. ""By the grace of God, we don't have four officers dead, because he certainly tried his best,"" he said. ""There were multiple, and I mean multiple, rounds fired at the police officers.... That man didn't hesitate to shoot."" There was initial confusion regarding the identity of the suspect, Alvarez said, because Labeet's girlfriend, who was apprehended at the scene of the shootings, gave authorities the wrong name. ""She purposely misled and delayed our investigation,"" he said. Labeet, 25, had stolen the identity of another man, Kevin Wehner, 30, Alvarez said, and had been using Wehner's name and identification. That was the name initially given to police. After Wehner's name and picture were released to the media, the real Wehner contacted the Jacksonville, Florida, Sheriff's Office near his home. Jacksonville authorities said Wehner had come to the sheriff's office and been interviewed, and police were confident he was not involved and was a victim of identity theft. The girlfriend will likely face charges for providing false information, Alvarez said. Labeet has an outstanding warrant for aggravated assault from September 2002, police said Thursday night. Meanwhile, a law enforcement source said officers are working three locations in adjacent Broward County. The suspect's mother, brother, a woman believed to be the brother's girlfriend and her two children were being questioned at the Broward County Sheriff's Office, the source said. Officers also were at a grocery store warehouse where the suspect's mother works in Deerfield Beach, Florida, and at the mother's home in Margate, the source said. A car believed connected to Labeet was found at a Target store in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, a few hours after the shooting, police said. It was occupied by a man, woman and two children, who were being interviewed, O'Brien said. The car, a 2007 black Pontiac Vibe, was rented to Labeet's brother, Shane Labeet, according to Kevin Meyer, a spokesman for the car rental company. Parts of the complex where the shooting occurred were evacuated. Alvarez said Thursday night he had no information on when residents might be allowed back in their homes.

"George Zimmerman, set to stand trial in the 2012 shooting death of teenager Trayvon Martin, on Tuesday waived his right to a ""stand your ground"" pretrial immunity hearing. Zimmerman's attorneys have decided they will try this as a self-defense case. Florida's deadly force law, also called ""stand your ground"", was passed in 2005. It allows people to meet ""force with force"" if they believe they or someone else is in danger of being seriously harmed by an assailant. Under the law, a person can use deadly force anywhere as long as he is not engaged in an unlawful activity, is being attacked in a place he has a right to be, and reasonably believes that his life and safety are in danger as a result of an overt act or perceived threat committed by someone else. In a pretrial immunity hearing, a judge would have ruled whether Zimmerman's actions were protected under the ""stand your ground"" law; a ruling in favor of the defendant would have meant that no criminal or civil trial could proceed. Martin was shot and killed on February 26, 2012, while returning from a nearby convenience store to his father's fiancée's house in a gated community in Sanford, Florida. Zimmerman, a neighborhood watch captain, acknowledged that he shot the unarmed 17-year-old, but said Martin physically attacked him and he fired in self-defense. Initially, no charges were pursued, and the case soon became the center of a national controversy. Zimmerman was charged with second-degree murder on April 11, 2012. During Tuesday's motions hearing, Zimmerman defense attorney Mark O'Mara told Judge Debra Nelson there was nothing in the law that required the immunity hearing to take place before Zimmerman's trial. O'Mara said the hearing could be requested after the defense has presented its case, but ""we'd much rather have the jury address the issue of criminal liability or lack thereof."" Benjamin Crump, attorney for the Martin family, said Zimmerman's decision to ""merge"" the hearing and the trial ""is very telling of his defense, or lack thereof."" ""We believe the defense's decision to waive a pretrial hearing and to merge the 'stand your ground' hearing into the trial is to prevent putting George Zimmerman on the stand,"" Crump said in a press release, ""and to preclude the public and the potential jury pool from previewing the many inconsistencies in George Zimmerman's story."" Crump said a pretrial hearing was clearly the intent of state law because the statute ""grants immunity from civil lawsuits, arrests and trials, if a defendant prevails."" Crump continued: ""... the decision made by the defense to waive a pretrial hearing and to solely continue on to trial vindicates the many thousands of protesters who demanded George Zimmerman be arrested for the killing of Trayvon Martin. After all, to have a felony criminal trial an arrest must first be made."" After the motions hearing ended, prosecutors and defense attorneys were to meet in private with the judge to discuss jury issues for the June 10 trial.","George Zimmerman waives his right to a ""stand your ground"" pretrial immunity hearing .

"(CNN)  -- Spain's Champions League woes continued as Sevilla were beaten 2-1 at home by CSKA Moscow to go out at the first knockout stage 3-2 on aggregate. A disastrous goalkeeping error from their captain Andres Palop sealed Moscow's passage to the quarterfinals, the first time a Russian team has reached that stage in over a decade. With the tie level at 2-2, Palop made a hash of a long-range free kick from Keisuke Honda as he could tried to punch the ball away and saw it fly into his net. Sevilla pressed but could not find the two goals they then needed to avoid joining Spanish league leaders Real Madrid in exiting from Europe's premier club competition at the same stage. It leaves just holders Barcelona, who are in action against VfB Stuttgart on Wednesday, as Spain's last hope in the competition. Tomas Necid put CSKA ahead in the 39th minute lead only for Argentine Diego Perotti to equalize two minutes later and level the tie 2-2 on aggregate. But Palop's error proved decisive. ""Of course it is a real shame to go out but we have to bounce back from this,"" home striker Alvaro Negredo told AFP. ""CSKA deserve it and you have to congratulate them even though it hurts."" Sevilla, who drew 1-1 in Moscow and looked favorites to go through, fielded a defensive line-up as coach Manolo Jimenez opted to leave the likes of Negredo and Mali star Frederic Kanoute on the bench. Brazilian Luis Fabiano was left as a lone striker but it was winger Jesus Navas who missed a glorious chance to put them ahead after only three minutes but he shot straight at goalkeeper Igor Akinfeev. The Russians, who are just back in action after their midwinter break, went ahead when Necid curled his shot home, but Navas then assisted as Perotti equalized almost immediately. Sevilla had chances to move ahead before Palop's mistake which took the sting out of their challenge as CSKA reached the last eight of the Champions League for the first time.","CSKA Moscow beat Sevilla 2-1 to go through 3-2 on aggregate in Champions League .

"Almost 70 years after the liberation of Auschwitz, the concentration camp set up by the Germans to exterminate Jewish prisoners, there are still a handful of Nazis who continue to receive U.S. Social Security benefits. The House unanimously passed a bill -- dubbed the ""No Social Security for Nazis Act"" -- on Tuesday that would cut off those benefits. Texas Republican Rep. Sam Johnson, a decorated Air Force veteran who was a prisoner of war for seven years during the Vietnam War, was the lead sponsor of the legislation. ""While the number of Nazis receiving Social Security is few, allowing payments to continue is an insult to those who suffered at the hands of the Nazis,"" Johnson said. Congress has considered various proposals designed to deny any benefits from Nazis. This latest bill was introduced last month after a recent Associated Press investigation reported that dozens of Nazis who were deported from the United States were still collecting millions of dollars in retirement benefits. Even though these people were stripped of their U.S. citizenship and forced to leave the country a loophole in the law allowed them to continue receiving Social Security checks. Democratic Rep. Carolyn Maloney of New York, who has been a key proponent in changing the law, told CNN that she has asked both the Justice Department and Social Security Administration to find out how much money was paid out and how many were still receiving any social security funds. She estimated there were roughly four individuals who were still eligible for the payments. ""They are dying out, but anybody who gets it is too much. They came to this country under false pretenses,"" Maloney told CNN. Suspected Nazi war criminal dies hours before court approves extradition . There is a companion bill in the Senate and the sponsors of the House bill are confident that this is one item that both parties in the House and Senate can get to the President's desk before the lame duck session of wraps up this month.

"New York City will change its policy on possession of small amounts of marijuana, giving police officers the option of writing offenders a ticket instead of taking them into custody, city officials said Monday at a press conference. Mayor Bill de Blasio said the change will remove the stigma of a criminal conviction for many young people who are arrested for misdemeanor marijuana possession. Such a conviction can prevent people from getting a job or housing, he said. ""A summons will not affect their future,"" he said. ""An arrest could."" The policy change, which goes into effect November 19, will only affect cases involving 25 grams (.88 ounce) or less of marijuana, Police Commissioner William Bratton said. The officer can choose to write a citation, which requires the suspect to appear in court later, Bratton said. The marijuana would be seized and the person who had the marijuana would continue with their day. The fine for a first offense would usually be $100, officials said. Officers will make judgment call . If the officer does decide to take the suspect into custody, the suspect would be handcuffed and taken to the station house for fingerprinting and a mugshot, Bratton said.  Police didn't specify the penalties but said they'd be tougher than for a citation. As to how that decision would be made, de Blasio said, ""An officer ultimately has to make the judgment on the scene."" If police find somebody smoking marijuana -- as opposed to simply possessing it -- the suspect would have to go through the entire arrest procedure, Bratton said. People without proper identification or people with outstanding warrants would be taken into custody, he said. De Blasio said misdemeanor marijuana arrests disproportionately affect young people in minority groups in New York City. He said many job applications ask about arrests or convictions, but not summonses. ""We don't want to saddle someone who made one small mistake with something that will follow them all their lives,"" the mayor said. 'You will see fewer unnecessary arrests' De Blasio said the policy change will also free up New York City police to concentrate on more serious crimes. The officers won't have to spend hours at the station house or in court because of small amounts of marijuana. ""You will see fewer unnecessary arrests,"" he said, noting that misdemeanor marijuana arrests have declined for several years. Voters in Colorado, Washington state, Oregon, Alaska and Washington, D.C., have voted to legalize recreational marijuana. New York law still bans possession of the drug. The policy shift only changes how police would enforce the existing law. De Blassio and Bratton said they do not support legalizing recreational marijuana. The policy change was first reported Sunday by the New York Times.","New York City police may write a ticket for small amounts of marijuana, officials said .
The policy change will only affect cases involving up to 25 grams of marijauna .

"Few airline routes are as cutthroat as the one between London and New York. It is the world's busiest intercontinental route and -- peppered with business travelers -- one of the most lucrative. There are few lengths airlines won't go to in the hopes of getting a piece of the action. We look at how the different carriers stack up. BA: It's all business (class) It may not be the cheapest way to travel between the two cities, but British Airways' all-business class flight is definitely one of the plushest. Aimed at London's and New York's bankers, it is also one of the few flights to leave from London City Airport. Perks include all the standard business class amenities -- gourmet food, lie-flat beds, airport lounge access -- as well as some innovative extras. Instead of a traditional in-flight entertainment system, for instance, customers are given use of their very own iPad. Perhaps the sweetest offering, however, is that passengers get to skip the line at customs. To facilitate this, the plane makes a pit stop at Ireland's Shannon Airport, which introduced a pre-clearance facility in 2009. It helps that BA has partnered with American Airlines. Together, the two carriers own the largest market share (53%) of this route, and offer the most flights -- 17 a day -- between the two cities. Delta-Virgin: When in doubt, merge . Last year, neither Delta Airlines nor Virgin Atlantic held a particularly admirable market share of the London-New York route. Then, they decided to merge, with Delta acquiring 49% of the British carrier. For Delta, the move meant the ability to offer three times as many flights between the two hubs. For Virgin, it meant access to new, untapped markets in the U.S. ""We are a UK-based airline, and we need to offer a set of flights and services and attractive features to customers in the UK first and foremost,"" admits Craig Kreeger, CEO of Virgin Atlantic. ""We need to expand our network in order to do so, and Delta helps us going in one direction -- but it is the direction that is the biggest for us."" Since the merger, the airlines have acquired 33% of the market on that route. Still, the two airlines have retained their separate identity, with separate perks. For Delta's U.S.-bound Diamond Medallion customers (the frequent, frequent flyers who cover at least 125,000 miles per year), a Porsche will transfer them between gates. Lie-flat beds and gourmet food (with wine pairings) are par for the course on business class flights, though Delta stands out by also providing Westin Heavenly in-flight bedding.  Delta also offers the Dine & Rest program, an expedited meal that lets flyers chill out for the remainder of their journey. Younger road warriors traveling in business class, meanwhile, are drawn to Virgin's cool lighting, on-board bar and limousine pick-up service. The London Heathrow Clubhouse -- Virgin's upper class lounge -- meanwhile excels at offering the unexpected, including free-flowing cocktails, and restaurant-quality meals. There is even a spa to help visitors unwind before a flight. United Airlines: The underdog . United Airlines, which merged with Continental Airlines in 2010, can't hope to compete with the other industry giants, who have invested a lot of time and money on the New York-London route. Though they offer the fewest daily flights (five), the carrier has made inroads. United has set up a plush hub in Heathrow's newly renovated Terminal 2. On the New York-end, they fly into Newark, which offers smaller queues than JFK Airport. Jeff Smisek, United's CEO, also says the airline is working with its strengths. ""Our position is basically that we offer a good service out of New York. It's not as big as BA's, but we offer a good schedule and we offer our entire network with a lot of connecting opportunities,"" he says.","London to New York is the world's busiest airline route .

"(CNN) -- A pedophile suspect who became the subject of an international manhunt this week after an appeal from Interpol has been detained in the United States. Wayne Nelson Corliss was arrested at his New Jersey apartment. Wayne Nelson Corliss, 58, was arrested at his apartment in Union City, New Jersey, about midnight Wednesday by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents, Interpol said in a written statement. He is believed to have worked as an actor using the name Casey Wayne and to have worked as a Santa Claus in New York during the holiday season, Interpol said. Corliss appeared Thursday before a U.S. magistrate in Newark, New Jersey, but did not enter a plea. During that appearance, prosecutors said he had confessed and acknowledged traveling to Thailand, where on three occasions he abused boys between 6 and 10 years old after using a madam to find them. Prosecutors said he brought back a pair of boys' underwear as a souvenir. It was among items found in his apartment, along with five hard drives containing more than 1,000 images of child pornography, according to prosecutors. In addition, authorities said Corliss admitted to frequenting online chat rooms that discuss having sex with children. Interpol announced Tuesday that it was attempting to identify the man, who was featured in 100 photographs sexually abusing at least three boys between the ages of 6 and 10, it said. The images came to light in 2006, when Norwegian authorities discovered them in the possession of a man they arrested. They were believed to have been taken in Southeast Asia. Interpol posted six pictures of the suspect on its Web site. ""Two days ago, this man's nationality, identity and location were totally unknown,"" Interpol Secretary General Ronald K. Noble said. ""All we had to go by were a series of graphic photographs in which the suspect was seen sexually abusing young children and our confidence that the public and police worldwide would once again respond to Interpol's call for assistance. ""That two days later the primary suspect is now in custody is an outstanding achievement and credit to the citizens, media and law enforcement worldwide who responded to Interpol's call."" Corliss is charged with producing child pornography, according to prosecutors. He faces a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison, with a 10-year minimum, if convicted in the United States. Other charges could be sought when the case is presented to a grand jury, said Michael Drewniak, spokesman for the U.S. attorney's office in New Jersey. The images found in 2006 were on a computer and stored in a file named ""Thai--Luv,"" according to the criminal complaint filed against Corliss, which was released by the Department of Justice. Data on the images showed that they had been taken in 2000. The complaint alleges that the suspect's face is clearly shown and the background suggests the images were taken in Thailand. ""The images depict an airport luggage tag with the code 'BKK.' BKK is the luggage tag code for Suvarnabhumi International Airport in Bangkok, Thailand."" Also shown is a ""Chang"" water bottle, common in Thailand, the court documents said. A search of U.S. passport information found an image of Corliss that police compared to the photographs, the complaint said. ""Furthermore, databases maintained by the Department of Homeland Security indicated extensive travel to Asia by defendant Corliss."" On Wednesday, Interpol said it was sifting through hundreds of tips that had poured in. The organization, which facilitates global cooperation among police agencies, said Thursday that it received nearly 250,000 visits to its Web site within the first 24 hours after its appeal was launched -- more than 10 times the daily average. Such tactics have proved successful for Interpol in the past. In October, it disseminated pictures of another man whose face -- altered to disguise his identity -- appeared in more than 200 images of sex acts with children, thought to have been taken in Vietnam and Cambodia. Ten days later, Christopher Paul Neil, a 32-year-old Canadian who had been working as an English-language teacher in South Korea, was arrested in Thailand and charged with child abuse after police managed to reverse the photo-masking process. After the success of that operation, Interpol's general assembly approved a resolution allowing Interpol to seek public help in child sex abuse investigations.

"(CNN) -- An African-American man has pleaded guilty after being accused of impersonating a white supremacist in a fictitious Facebook account to make death threats against an African-American university student. A Mississippi man admitted creating a false Facebook profile in November. Dyron L. Hart, 20, of Poplarville, Mississippi, pleaded guilty Wednesday before U.S. District Judge Kurt D. Engelhardt to one count of communicating threats in interstate commerce, according to a Department of Justice statement. Hart admitted creating the fictitious account in November, pretending to be a white supremacist outraged by the election of Barack Obama as the nation's first African-American president, the statement said. He then transmitted a death threat via Facebook to an African-American student at Nicholls State University in Louisiana, saying he wanted to kill African-Americans because of Obama's election, according to the statement. A court document provided by the U.S. attorney's office said Hart told an FBI interviewer that  he intended the threat to be a prank ""to get a reaction."" The document said Hart admitted creating the Facebook profile under the name ""Colten Brodoux"" and used a photo of a Caucasian man that he found on a white supremacist Web site. ""This is an extremely odd case, a very unusual case,"" said U.S. Attorney Jim Letten of the Eastern District of Louisiana. ""The contents of the messages were extremely troubling and provocative and very threatening."" Hart will face a maximum sentence of five years in prison and a $250,000 fine when sentenced November 18, the statement said.

"The suspected ringleader of the deadly terror attack on the U.S. diplomatic compound in Benghazi, Libya, will remain jailed until trial, a federal magistrate ruled on Wednesday. Ahmed Abu Khatallah appeared at a brief detention hearing in federal court in Washington where he's accused of providing material support to terrorists. Court documents released on the eve of the hearing allege he ""conspired to participate and then participated"" in the September 11, 2012, attack on the American outpost in eastern Libya that killed Ambassador Christopher Stevens and three other Americans. He previously pleaded not guilty to the charge that carries a maximum life prison sentence. More are charges are possible. Abu Khatallah, who is thought to be in his early 40s, was captured earlier this month in Libya and transferred to the United States last weekend. Authorities contend that he's a senior leader of Ansar al Sharia, whose members were among several militias that participated in the two-pronged armed assault. Assailants armed with automatic weapons and rocket-propelled grenades first blasted through the main diplomatic mission before setting it ablaze, the court papers said. Stevens and State Department information officer Sean Smith died there. A coordinated mortar assault on a nearby annex killed security officers Tyrone Woods and Glen Doherty. ""The defendant's participation in the attack was motivated by his extremist ideology,"" prosecutors said in the documents, which also alleged that Abu Khatallah ""voiced concern and opposition to the presence of an American facility in Benghazi"" days prior to the attack. Obama under fire over Benghazi suspect . Arguing for his continued detention, prosecutors said that Abu Khatallah, since the attack, ""has continued to make efforts to target American personnel and property"" and ""discuss with others his deadly and destructive intentions,"" prosecutors said. But defense lawyers contend the Justice Department hasn't provided evidence to support the case. CNN's Pamela Brown asked lead prosecutor Michael DiLorenzo about the claims from Abu Khatallah's camp regarding pre-trial discovery. He responded that prosecutors would try the case in court. The Benghazi attack has become a political flashpoint with Republicans, especially, questioning security protections beforehand, the U.S. response during the assault, and the Obama administration's slow-to-evolve public explanation of what transpired. GOP members also are scrutinizing how Hillary Clinton handled the matter. She oversaw U.S. diplomacy at the time as secretary of state, and questions about her responses and decisionmaking endure as she considers a run for president. Benghazi attack timeline .

"As Air Force One landed in Estonia's capital Wednesday, President Barack Obama's message to Vladimir Putin -- only 500 miles away in Moscow -- was clear: Stay put. Obama's trip to the former Soviet state, ahead of this week's NATO summit in Wales, is meant to reassure nervous Eastern Europe that Putin's support for separatists in Ukraine doesn't mean he has a free pass for territorial gains elsewhere. In a speech in Tallinn, Obama said the vision of a Europe dedicated to peace and freedom is ""threatened by Russia's aggression against Ukraine,"" but said NATO will not allow that aggression to go unchecked. ""We will defend our NATO allies, and that means every ally,"" he said. ""We will be here for Estonia. ... You lost your independence once before. With NATO, you will never lose it again."" Added to the schedule only last month, the stop in Estonia supplements the message coming from NATO leaders gathering in Cardiff, Wales, who are set to announce the positioning of troops and equipment closer to Russia in Eastern Europe. In earlier comments alongside Estonia's President, Obama recalled the ""deep ties"" between the two nations as he announced plans for additional U.S. Air Force units to be based in Estonia as part of a bolstering of NATO forces in the region. ""One of our goals at the summit over the next several days is to once again project unity across NATO on behalf of Ukraine's efforts to maintain its sovereignty and territorial integrity,"" Obama said. He added that Russia was ""paying a heavy price for its actions,"" in part through Western sanctions imposed over Ukraine, and that NATO is poised to do more to help Ukraine defend itself. He said more European NATO members need to spend a full 2% of their gross domestic product on defense to keep NATO strong. The approaching NATO summit is an opportunity for these countries to pledge this, he said. ""Estonia does it. Every ally must do it,"" he said. NATO needs to create 'high-readiness force,' secretary general says . The NATO leaders also must confront the separate threat of militant Islamists making gains in Syria and Iraq, and the brutal beheading of a second American by ISIS, also known as ISIL or the ""Islamic State."" Asked about his strategy on the extremist group, Obama said: ""The bottom line is this: Our objective is clear, and that is to degrade and destroy ISIL so it's no longer a threat not just to Iraq, but also to the region and to the United States. ""In order for us to accomplish that, the first phase has been to make sure we've got an Iraqi government that's in place, and that we are blunting the momentum that ISIL was carrying out. ""And the airstrikes have done that. But now, what we need to do is make sure that we've got the regional strategy in place that can support an ongoing effort, not just in the air, but on the ground, to move that forward."" Analyst: NATO must adapt . The original reason for the summit was to determine how NATO's mission will proceed in Afghanistan when combat troops depart at the end of the year. But the global unrest, while causing political strife for Obama in the United States, could provide a new purpose for the 65-year-old NATO alliance, which is suffering an ""identity crisis,"" according to one analyst. Russian official: Russia is emotionally in Ukraine, its troops are not . Putin's actions in Russia have ""required NATO to really adapt and change fairly dramatically,"" said Heather Conley, who directs the Europe program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. ""In some ways, NATO should thank Vladimir Putin, because it was really searching for its purpose,"" Conley said. Warning Putin . NATO members that border Russia, watching the once unthinkable breach of Ukraine's borders, are looking to the military alliance to affirm its commitment to the North Atlantic Treaty's Article 5, which provides for collective defense of states under attack. Ukraine isn't a NATO member, though leaders did invite the country's new President, Petro Poroshenko, to Wales this week. Other former Soviet states, like Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania, joined NATO in the past decade, hoping to bolster ties to the West while increasing their own security frameworks. As reassurance to those countries, NATO leaders plan to approve the creation of a ""high-readiness"" force that places new equipment and thousands of troops in Eastern Europe. Ukraine warns of return to 'full-scale war' White House officials say the move is meant to be defensive rather than a provocation for Russia, though initial reaction from the Kremlin -- which called the move an ""external threat"" -- foreshadowed a potential escalation of the crisis. NATO and Russia have agreed since 1997 that no permanent NATO troops will be positioned in Eastern Europe, meaning member states will rotate forces through bases closest to Russia. Charles Kupchan, Obama's top adviser for European affairs, said leaders will describe the new effort as a ""persistent"" force in the easternmost countries, rather than ""permanent."" ""We will see persistent rotation, persistent exercises to ensure that Estonia and that other countries in Central and Eastern Europe are provided the reassurance from NATO and the presence of NATO needed to meet their security needs,"" he said. Opinion: What's Russia doing in Ukraine, and what can the West do? Battling ISIS . Not on the official agenda in Wales, the ongoing spread of ISIS fighters in Iraq and Syria will nonetheless play a major role in Obama's discussions in Wales. The meeting comes after a video posted Tuesday that shows the beheading of a second American, Steven Sotloff. The killing of Sotloff follows a threat made by ISIS last month during the videotaped beheading of American journalist James Foley. The latest video threatens the life of another man, a British citizen. Obama has said he wants to form a coalition of governments willing to take on the group, which has taken over huge swaths of territory and terrorized ethnic minorities. Officials say that could include a role for NATO, though in what capacity is so far unclear -- after all, Obama himself hasn't yet decided whether to undertake airstrikes against ISIS in Syria. Western European leaders must also confront the growing threat of ""homegrown terrorism"" -- citizens leaving to fight with militant groups in Syria and Iraq, and potentially returning to stage a terror attack at home. The host of the NATO summit, British Prime Minister David Cameron, already announced new measures to combat that threat after a London-accented militant was filmed beheading journalist James Foley. ISIS video shows beheading of second journalist . ""There will have to be an acknowledgment that individual European countries, and certainly the United States, are taking action, actively working militarily on issues relating to Iraq and then potentially Syria,"" said Kathleen Hicks, the director of the international security program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. Cameron lays out plans to counter UK jihadi threat . Afghanistan's future . Just as the United States is anxiously watching the final outcome of Afghanistan's recent election, NATO member states are wondering what their role will be there after this year ends. Both candidates in the contested vote have said they'll sign an agreement allowing U.S. troops to remain there past 2014. But without a winner, the Bilateral Security Agreement remains unsigned. Hanging over the decision is the security situation in Iraq, which completely unraveled after U.S. troops' withdrawal. Neither Obama nor his NATO counterparts want the same thing to happen in Afghanistan. Gunmen target spy agency in Afghanistan . ""We're moving into a world in which NATO will be less salient in Afghanistan, but in which we want to capitalize on the lessons that we've learned, the partnerships that we've built,"" Kupchan said. No expansion . NATO last admitted new members in 2009, but leaders are quick to note this year's summit isn't about expansion. The appetite for letting countries like Bosnia and Macedonia -- labeled ""aspirant countries"" -- into the club has waned. It's hard enough to get the 28 current members to agree on things, officials say. Case in point: NATO is having a tough time convincing its members to spend more on their militaries, a requirement for membership. The United States spends about 4.4% of its gross domestic product on defense, according to NATO figures; the European average is 1.6%. NATO's guidelines encourage countries to spend at least 2% of their GDP on defense. ""Part of the reason I think this NATO meeting is going to be so important is to refocus attention on the critical function that NATO plays to make sure that every country is contributing in order to deliver on the promise of our Article 5 assurances,"" Obama said at a news conference last week. But analysts say that as long as economic conditions in Europe remain bleak, countries will remain hesitant to ramp up their military spending, even as external threats grow. ""The Ukraine crisis has been a wake-up call,"" said Conley, the Europe program director at CSIS. ""Now, whether the Europeans will hit the snooze button or not, again, I don't know, but it has certainly shaken them, that they have allowed their military defense spending to atrophy to a point where they are now vulnerable.""","""We will defend our NATO allies,"" President Barack Obama says .

"Anyone who imagines U.S. President Barack Obama and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe discussed territorial disputes with China or the U.S.'s ""pivot to Asia"" foreign policy during their private dinner in Tokyo on Wednesday likely isn't familiar with the restaurant where the two leaders dined. Ahead of a protocol-bound formal state visit that officially begins on Thursday, Abe took Obama to Sukiyabashi Jiro, the fabled restaurant in Tokyo's fashionable Ginza district widely regarded as the best sushi restaurant in the world. Diners approach Sukiyabashi Jiro with a sense of reverence. The Japanese food provided by head chef and proprietor Jiro Ono leaves little time for small talk, much less big talk. The focus is on the fish. Heralded as a Japanese national treasure, Ono, who turns 90 next year, is the first sushi chef in the world to receive three Michelin stars. With hundreds of onlookers behind police barriers lining the streets near the restaurant, Obama and Abe, neither wearing neckties, shook hands and entered the basement restaurant. New U.S. ambassador to Japan, Caroline Kennedy, also attended the dinner, which lasted about an hour and a half. Like those who have gone before him into this shrine of sushi, Obama did not leave disappointed. ""President Obama told me that, 'I was born in Hawaii and ate a lot of sushi, but this was the best sushi I've ever had in my life,'"" Abe told Japan's NHK network after the meal. So what did Obama and Abe experience once the doors closed on their private dinner? The following review of Sukiyabashi Jiro, originally published by CNN in 2012, might give a small taste. World's best sushi at Sukiyabashi Jiro . Hidden in a basement attached to the Ginza Metro Station, Sukiyabashi Jiro has vaulted into the worldwide cultural milieu thanks to the 2012 release of the David Gelb feature-length documentary ""Jiro Dreams of Sushi."" Rather than simply watch the spectacular food porn that is Gelb's doc, I went a step further, traveling directly to the source to offer the following account of chef Jiro's legendary soft-handed, two-fingered technique that pairs fresh nigiri cuts from the Tsukiji fish market with warm and delicate rice. Here's how the evening went. Spoiler: I wasn't disappointed. 6:58 p.m. Walking through the entrance of Sukiyabashi Jiro, I take a deep breath, slowing my heart rate to match the tranquil environment inside. Minutes earlier, while lost on the streets of Ginza, I was worried about missing the seating on a three-month-old reservation and the resulting 15,000 yen ($146) cancellation penalty. But I've arrived on time, prepared to eat some sushi. Online clamor has it that the folks at Jiro are wary of non-Japanese, some people even going so far as to assert the restaurant's service is rude; so I'm extra cautious, but encounter no such attitude. I'm escorted to one of 10 seats at this shrine to Japanese sushi, offered a warm towel to clean my hands and face, a cup of tea and even a small rubber pad so that my camera doesn't make direct contact with the altar-like counter top. 7 p.m. The staff wastes no time, quickly asking if I have any dietary restrictions. When I answer no, chef Jiro and his son Yoshikazu immediately present a menu detailing the 19-piece ""Chef's Recommended Special Course,"" followed by the first dish, karei, or sole. A light, flat fish, the sole is expertly glazed with soy sauce and placed atop a two-inch bed of rice. With a bit of hesitation, I forgo chopsticks, soy sauce and wasabi altogether for the traditional fingers-only approach and prepare to enjoy that first taste of perfection. 7:01 p.m. The karei cleanses my palate, offering a dose of fishiness without overpowering the taste buds. It's the perfect appetizer, and there's no doubt that chef Jiro has designed tonight's custom menu to lead my sense of taste through a special gastronomic journey. 7:02 p.m. Next up, sumi-ika, or squid. Its slightly rubbery texture engages my teeth to chew a bit more and spread the flavor around my mouth. The quality of the fish is already apparent in these first two pieces, but what's also clear is that Jiro's special grade of rice, made available only to him, is the unsung hero of this sushi combination. Served at body temperature, the rice is slightly acidic, carrying a distinct flavor of vinegar, and subdues the palate to complement the explosive flavors of the fish. 7:04 p.m. A naturally slow eater, I'm already having trouble keeping up with Jiro's pace, but I have faith that his speed is designed to enhance the culinary experience, and I quickly engulf his next cut, inada, or young yellowtail. Rich in flavor and lightly glazed with soy sauce, the inada is the first real ""fishy fish"" in the sequence. 7:05-7:09 p.m. The holy trinity of sushi has arrived: Akami, Chu-toro and Oo-toro; a progression of tuna nigiri, aged up to 10 days, that transitions from the leanest to the fattiest, and ensures that I'll never again be able to enjoy another restaurant's raw fish in my mouth quite this much. While the Akami sets the tone, and the Oo-toro rounds out the movement, it's the Chu-Toro, the lightly marbleized, medium fatty tuna from the upper belly, paired with a hint of wasabi between the fish and the rice, that melts on my tongue, evaporating into a sublime and heavenly flavor as I swallow. 7:11 p.m. Kohada, or gizzard shad, is next, and while I've never heard of this fish, it's a member of the herring family and its shiny sliver and blue-spotted skin are so picturesque that I momentarily pause in awe before popping this bite in my mouth. 7:13 p.m. The marathon continues with akagai, or ark shell clam. The first shellfish on the menu, the akagai carries an interesting slimy texture that's balanced by an engaging chewiness. 7:15 p.m. Piece number nine is the tako, or octopus. Supposedly massaged by Jiro's apprentices for 50 minutes prior to serving, the tako is chewy, crunchy and refreshing, and served with a light salt rub. But please, ""no soy sauce,"" explain the master chef and his son, the first words they've uttered during this entire experience. 7:16 p.m. Aji, or horse mackerel, is served. I quickly take the aji down, followed by a small bite of pickled ginger. 7:18 p.m. Next up is kuruma-ebi, or tiger shrimp. A two-piece serving -- one head, one tail -- kuruma-ebi is a hearty and meaty prawn, with vibrant coloring, expertly cut to incorporate the flavor of the head, and a complete work of art. 7:19 p.m. Sayori, or springtime halfbeak, arrives. While not a popular nigiri cut outside of Japan, it's a beautiful specimen, a long sparkly strip of fish wrapped like a ribbon atop the rice, full of rounded ridges on one side. A species apparently fed upon by predatory fishes, this sayori has just become the victim of a red-blooded carnivore. 7:20 p.m. Never before have I ever seen such a magnificent clam; the hamaguri, topped with a touch of sweet glaze, is both chewy and satisfying. It carries the distinct flavor of clam, but with none of the regular crunchiness found in shellfish mantle. 7:22 p.m. Piece number 14, saba, or skinless mackerel. Fresh, fishy, moist and succulent, the saba is another nigiri slice that melts upon consumption. Jiro may not say much, and while many previous customers have mistaken his silence as contempt, the truth is that he speaks with his palms and fingers, which create a combination of fish and rice unmatched by any other. 7:23-7:26 p.m. Yoshikazu prepares the soft-yet-crunchy seaweed outer layer for another trio of rich flavor: uni, or sea urchin, kobashira, or small scallop abductor muscle and ikura, or salmon roe. A bottom feeder, uni is generally something I avoid, but from the hands of chef Jiro it becomes a creamy, rich morsel of the ocean floor. Kobashira and ikura are equally good, the small scallops glazed and tender, the roe larger than normal, a quick shot of salmon juice squirting out as each individual egg is popped with every chew. 7:28 p.m. Anago, or saltwater eel, is the final fish in the omakase set. Unlike any other eel I've ever eaten, it carries a sweet kabayaki taste -- Yoshikazu himself once again suggests ""no soy sauce."" 7:29 p.m. The ""Chef's Special Course"" comes to a close with tamago, a sweet egg that tastes a bit like sponge cake. One of Sukiyabashi Jiro's many specialties, tamago is a perfect dessert, fluffy and moist, a satisfying end to an intense 30 minutes. 7:31 p.m. I bow slightly toward Jiro, acknowledging his skills, and he bows back. All at once, I'm whisked away to a booth behind the main sushi bar for a slice of juicy honeydew melon, served for its digestive benefits, and another cup of tea. 7:37 p.m. While the whole experience is priceless, it's time to put a figure on this sushi dream. One of Jiro's shokunin, or ""craftsmen,"" then presents me with a bill for 30,000 yen ($292), plus tax, and kindly reminds that it's cash only. Significantly lighter in the wallet, I surrender. Jiro has lived up to its reputation as the world's greatest sushi restaurant, and although the price was hefty, the food was certainly worthy.

"Ahmed Abu Khatallah, the man the U.S. accuses of being the ringleader in the deadly 2012 attack on the American diplomatic mission in Benghazi, Libya, pleaded not guilty Saturday during a brief appearance in federal court in Washington. Abu Khatallah, with long graying hair and a beard, spoke quietly in Arabic with a translator as he was charged with one count of providing material support to terrorists. A federal grand jury returned a single-count indictment Thursday in connection with attacks that killed four Americans, including U.S. Ambassador to Libya Chris Stevens. Standing before U.S. Magistrate Judge John M. Facciola, Abu Khatallah appeared subdued and briefly looked around the nearly full courtroom. Wearing a dark gray hooded track suit and sandals, the defendant addressed the court only once to say his name in a barely audible voice. Abu Khatallah was appointed a public defender, Michele Peterson, who entered a not guilty plea. He was ordered to remain in custody until hearings set for July 2 and July 8. ""Now that Ahmed Abu Khatallah has arrived in the United States, he will face the full weight of our justice system,"" U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder said.  ""We will prove, beyond a reasonable doubt, the defendant's alleged role in the attack that killed four brave Americans in Benghazi."" Abu Khatallah was indicted by a federal grand jury on a charge of ""conspiracy to provide material support and resources to terrorists, knowing and intending that these would be used in preparation for and in carrying out a killing in the course of an attack on a federal facility, and the offense resulted in death,"" according to Holder's statement. The single count is part of a legal strategy by federal prosecutors, who plan to file additional charges later, according to U.S. officials. The aim is to delay releasing to the public and Abu Khatallah's lawyer the FBI affidavit detailing the evidence the government has against him. The investigation is ongoing and the Justice Department can bring additional charges, the statement said. An earlier criminal complaint in July 2013 said the FBI believed it had evidence to charge him with murder and firing a weapon at the scene of the Benghazi attacks. Those additional charges, if formally added, could bring the death penalty. In his court appearance, Abu Khatallah, a Libyan national who the government said is about 43, requested consular assistance from the Libyan government. U.S. authorities were working with Libyan embassy officials in Washington to provide him the assistance. He had been interrogated aboard the USS New York after being captured earlier this month. Though he was interrogated both before and after he had been advised of his Miranda rights, he provided information to interrogators after being advised of those rights, a U.S. official told CNN. On Saturday, he was flown by helicopter from the ship, an amphibious transport dock, to the nation's capital and driven to the federal courthouse. After the hearing, Abu Khatallah was taken away under armed guard from the federal courthouse in downtown Washington, a few blocks from the U.S. Capitol and near the White House. He was then moved to the detention center in Alexandria, Virginia, which is across the Potomac River from the capital. Authorities say Abu Khatallah is among the senior leaders of Ansar al Sharia, whose members were among several militias that participated in the attacks on U.S. government facilities in Benghazi on September 11-12, 2012. The attacks spawned a political controversy in the United States because some Republican lawmakers claim the Obama administration tried to mislead the public about them and should have done more to prevent them. The GOP critics say they plan to make Benghazi an issue for former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, under whose watch the attacks occurred, should she decide to run for president. The criminal investigation led by the FBI has been extraordinarily challenging, authorities say, in part because lack of Libyan government control in the city prevented investigators from visiting the crime scene for weeks. U.S. officials, however, say they collected surveillance video, phone eavesdropping and witness statements to bring charges against Abu Khatallah and others involved. They are charged in a criminal complaint in federal court in Washington. Abu Khatallah became the face of the militant attack, and a top target for the U.S., after he cultivated a celebrity profile in the wake of the attacks, meeting with journalists and granting interviews. He denied to CNN's Arwa Damon that he participated in the attacks. U.S. military commandos captured Abu Khatallah in a nighttime raid June 15-16. U.S. intelligence assets concocted a ruse to lure him to a villa where the Americans surprised him. The commandos, accompanied by several FBI agents, came ashore by boat and quickly took him away. He remained on the USS New York, undergoing questioning by a team from the FBI-led High-Value Detainee Interrogation Group, until he was taken to court on Saturday. Timeline of the Benghazi attack .

"(CNN) -- Lionel Messi scored a sensational second-half hat-trick as Barcelona beat 10-man Valencia 3-0 on Sunday, but they remain behind Spanish Primera Liga leaders Real Madrid, who beat Valladolid 4-1 in the late match. After a goalless opening 45 minutes at the Nou Camp, the introduction of substitute Thierry Henry turned the game, with the Frenchman's pace and guile causing chaos in the Valencia defence, allowing Messi to take full advantage with three superb goals. The opener came in the 56th minute when the 22-year-old Argentine somehow weaved his way past three defenders before slotting home from a tight angle. Valencia then missed a golden opportunity to level when giant striker Nikola Zigic was foiled by goalkeeper Victor Valdes after being put clean through. Then, just a minute later, the visitors had Hedwiges Maduro sent off for two bookable offences on Messi -- leaving gaps at the back that Barcelona exploited. Messi curled home his second goal with nine minutes remaining and just a minute later Valencia's defence parted again to allow Messi to chip home a delightful third goal. Valencia remain third despite the defeat, but they are now a massive 18 points off the lead, leaving the title race very much a two-team affair. Despite the victory, Barcelona remain behind bitter rivals Real Madrid on goal difference after Manuel Pellegrino's side recovered well from their Champions League exit to Lyon in midweek by thrashing Valladolid. Striker Gonzalo Higuain emulated the feat of fellow-Argentine Messi with a hat-trick, with Cristiano Ronaldo netting the opener courtesy of a trademark free-kick, as Real remain top by virtue of having a two-goal better goal difference. Elsewhere, Villarreal improved their chances of reaching the Europa League with a 2-0 home win over Xerez -- avenging their 2-1 defeat to the bottom side last October.","Lionel Messi scores a superb hat-trick as Barcelona thump Valencia 3-0 .

"""You! You have moto, yes?"" An elderly woman, her craggy face peering out from the folds of her voluminous black chador, demands my attention. I'm in the immigration line at the Turkey-Iran border and my heart is pounding as I wait to be stamped into the Islamic Republic. I nod warily, confirming that yes, that is me -- a solo female with a British passport and a motorcycle. I adjust my headscarf, fearing that my interrogator is a member of Iran's infamous ""morality police,"" the hardliners instructed to arrest women for ""immodest"" behavior. She jabs me in the chest. ""You come with moto?"" she asks again, twisting an imaginary throttle and even adding a few ""vroom vroom"" sound effects. I'm still not sure if I'm in trouble but her opinion becomes clear when she grabs my face and gives it an enthusiastic slap, before pulling me in for a rib-crushing hug. ""Very good! Very good!"" she shouts while I gasp for breath among the folds of her chador. ""I am wishing you all the luck in the world!"" Finding the 'real' Iran . This enthusiastic welcome sets the scene for my entire journey -- motorcycling 3,000 miles around Iran solo and female, from the rugged northwest of the country to the Caspian Sea and over the remote Alborz Mountains to the fume-choked streets of Tehran. My motivation? Curiosity about the huge gulf between how Iran is perceived in the West and what I hear about it from the few people I know who have been there. Often painted in the media as a terrifying place full of extremists, travelers who return from Iran invariably rave about how wonderful and welcoming they found the Iranian people. I wanted to discover the place for myself. Following some wild times in the capital, where it turns out you can get everything from contraband bacon to booze, I continue through the peaceful Zagros Mountains to the ancient cities of Esfehan, Shiraz and the deserts of the south. Reports of tourists being arrested for espionage are in the front of my mind when, at one border post, I'm frogmarched to the police station to be fingerprinted. But, of course, a people and its government are two separate entities. Persian hospitality is legendary and I find myself overwhelmed with generosity and kindness from Iranians keen to distance themselves from the negative image of their homeland -- from truckers stuffing pomegranates into my panniers to complete strangers insisting on paying for my hotel room and an endless stream of tea. Challenging too . Of course, there are a couple of challenging moments, most often involving the police. There are different kinds of police in Iran and on one occasion in Tehran a car full of plainclothes revolutionary guards deliberately drives into me. On another occasion I'm assaulted at a remote desert gas station by a pump attendant who is probably on meth (quite common in the rural areas, I'm told). Shouting, he lunges at me. Luckily I'm still sitting on the bike, and after a kick in the right place I ride off as fast as possible. But then I'm out in the desert with very little fuel ... a pretty scary scenario, too. In fact, the very act of riding a motorcycle can be daunting in Iran as the driving can be insane. Iran reportedly has the highest rate of road deaths and traffic related accidents in the world, so every morning I feel like I'm going into battle. But the welcome from the people makes up for it manifold. Curious and curiouser . I'm also a source of intense curiosity myself, especially as Iranian women are forbidden from riding motorcycles in public. Foreign travelers are rare in Iran and the sight of a UK-registered motorcycle caused much excitement among drivers who would pass me with an inch to spare, blasting their horns while hanging out the window and filming me on their phones. As I travel around I'm passed from stranger to stranger, who quickly become friends, and as a result, find myself mingling with a range of Iranian society. My hosts range from underground filmmakers and the designer-clad elite of Tehran to a rebel-rousing schoolgirl and Iran's celebrated explorer, Issa Omidvar, who motorcycled around the world in the 1950s. Iranians remain warm and fun-loving people. Some areas off limits . Riding isn't an entirely free affair though -- travelers must take care not to stray into military areas or near nuclear plants and taking pictures of military or official buildings is a no-no. For my project, I'd snap them quickly and then be on my way, reminded that the authoritarian streak is never far away. Vast murals of the Supreme Leader (Ayatollah Seyyed Ali Khamenei) loom over every street corner and everyone I meet has a story of police intimidation, arrests and the oppressive reality of life under the regime. In the desert city of Yazd I'm invited to stay with an ex-army general and his family. He fought in the Iran-Iraq war of the 1980s and lost his legs in the conflict. I'm wary of this invitation, wondering what I'll have in common with an Iranian veteran, but my concerns are unfounded. He's far from the grizzled war-monger I fear and within moments of meeting he's cracking jokes and teaching me Farsi slang. The highlight of the trip comes, unexpectedly, as we take the elevator in his apartment block to go out for dinner. I'm learning the Persian numbers as we descend each floor and as we count ""three, two, one"" he announces in English, ""It's the final countdown!"" We don't have to say anything. The two of us look at each other, laugh and burst into song. ""Da-da daa daa, da-da da da daa!"" This is the moment I know I'd been right to ignore the naysayers and to come and seek out the real Iran. Neither East nor West . Iran has always prided itself on being ""neither East nor West."" Geographically it stands between the two cultures, never aligning itself with either, making for the strong sense of Persian identity. Sadly, the popular image of Iran today, fueled by the rhetoric of politicians means that the Iranian people are lumped in with Islamic extremists and terrorism. This couldn't be further from the truth. My travels unveiled a nation of sophisticated, kindhearted people eager to engage with the wider world. If only their government would follow their example.","British travel writer Lois Pryce motorcycled 3,000 miles through Iran on her own .

"The day after Benghazi suspect Ahmed Abu Khatallah appeared in United States federal court in Washington, top Republicans in Congress continue to question the strategy to try him in the U.S. court system. Rep. Mike Rogers, chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, said that Abu Khatallah's prosecution in U.S. courts prevents authorities from getting necessary information about the Benghazi attack on a U.S. compound that killed four Americans, including Ambassador Christopher Stevens, in 2012. ""You need the opportunity to gather the intelligence that he has,"" the Michigan Republican said on CNN's ""State of the Union."" Lost intelligence? Abu Khatallah was brought to the United States via ship so interrogators would have more time to question him. But after 10 days, he was read his Miranda rights, a requirement of the criminal justice system. Miranda includes the right to remain silent to avoid self-incrimination, which he would not have if tried in military courts. Benghazi killings suspect Abu Khatallah pleads not guilty in U.S. Abu Khatallah is being charged with providing material support to terrorists, but prosecutors say more charges are possible. Uttering similar talking points on two different shows, Rogers and Rep. Michael McCaul of Texas, chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee, said intelligence gathering should be the priority over criminal prosecution. ""When we rushed to interrogate and rushed to Mirandize, we lose valuable intelligence,"" McCaul said on CBS News' ""Face the Nation."" A U.S. official told CNN that Abu Khatallah provided interrogators information both before and after he was read his Miranda rights, but Rogers said Abu Khatallah ""likely"" did not give actionable intelligence to FBI interrogators during his journey across the Atlantic Ocean. ""He could give ... some details of some things, but not to the point where an FBI agent would say, 'Hey, Bingo, here we go.'"" ""He's been compliant, but not cooperative,"" Rogers added. Rogers, McCaul and many Republicans in Congress would have preferred that Abu Khathallah be sent to the U.S. detention center at Guantanamo Bay and be tried through military tribunals, which offers the accused fewer rights for suspected terrorists. The President has resisted such calls and defends his decision, pointing to the prosecution of numerous other foreign terrorists that have been successfully tried and found guilty in U.S. courts. Obama has not sent one person to Guantanamo since he entered office in 2009. No one defended the Obama administration's decision on the political shows. Of the two Democratic members of Congress that appeared on the Sunday shows, neither was asked about Abu Khatallah. Controversy swirls over handling of Benghazi suspect Abu Khatallah . While many issues in Washington are rankled with partisanship, the Benghazi attack of September 11, 2012, has been especially plagued by bitter partisanship. And now that Hillary Clinton, who was secretary of state during the time, is now considered a potential presidential candidate, the issue's partisanship only intensified. ""We have brought a foreign terrorist and given him due process rights under our Constitution here in the United States, right down the street from [where] you and I are in the nation's Capitol,"" McCaul said. Rogers said charges of accused terrorists complicates the war against them. ""To me, these are enemy combatants. If we start saying they're criminals, I don't know how you fight back in a place like the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant,"" Rogers said, referring to ISIS. McCaul said it's ""shameful"" that other Benghazi suspects are not being apprehended because the U.S. is ""so intent on building a criminal prosecution."" ""I'm a federal prosecutor, but I think the ... military intelligence value outweighs a criminal case,"" he said. Rogers praises Abu Khatallah's capture . While Rogers criticized the administration, he praised Abu Khatallah's capture, saying it sends a ""clear message"" that the United States won't turn a blind eye to attacks on Americans. It's a message that is necessary, according to Rogers, as threats to Americans are at an all-time high as ISIS continues to destabilize Iraq and fight in Syria. ""This is as dangerous time for an al Qaeda threat to the United States as I've ever seen,"" he said. ""The terrorists in Syria are extremely sophisticated, very advanced."" Rogers pointed to a major vulnerability at international airports. ""I can't go into all the details, but overseas airport security is a real concern we've had in the U.S.,"" he said. Republicans on all the Sunday political shows expressed the same concern. Rep. Peter King, member of the House Homeland Security Committee, said on ABC's ""This Week"" that ""Syria is our biggest threat right now."" McCaul said ISIS is ""the number one national security threat since 9/11."" U.S. Sen. John Barrasso of Wyoming, on CBS News' ""Face the Nation,"" called ISIS the ""richest, most powerful and most savage group of terrorists in the history of mankind."" Iraq crisis: Key developments . ""I see ISIS as a direct threat to the United States, they have the capacity, and I believe they have the intent"" to attack, he said. Obama appeared to downplay the immediacy of the threats, saying the possibility of more attacks have existed throughout his presidency. ""I think we have been under serious threat predating 9/11 from those who embrace this ideology,"" he said on ""This Week."" In an effort to tamp down on ISIS' strength, Obama asked Congress this week for $500 million dollars to support moderate rebels in Syria's complex and multifaceted civil war. Picking the moderate faction is a complicated effort, however, as ISIS is fighting Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, whom the U.S. also opposes. Virginia Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin thinks it's a bad idea. ""For us to jump in and try to take sides and put money in there or air strikes or forces right now, not knowing who the friendlies are, and not knowing if any equipment that we send over there will get in the hands of ISIS, all we do is exasperate the problem,"" he said on ""Face the Nation.""","Republican lawmakers oppose Ahmed Abu Khatallah's trial in the U.S. court system .
They think he should have been sent to Guantanamo Bay .

"No park rangers welcoming you to the Golden Gate National Recreation Area. Gates shuttered at the Great Smoky Mountains National Park.  No guided hikes at the Grand Canyon. It's no surprise that the number of visitors to National Park Service sites took a 3% hit in 2013 because of the weeks-long U.S. government shutdown; it started October 1, at the height of fall leaf-peeping season. The most popular national parks . National park sites saw 9 million fewer visitors last year than the year before, according to National Park Service visitation data. More than 273 million people visited the nation's 401 national park sites in 2013, down from more than 282 million people in 2012. (The 401 park sites include the headliner national parks, national seashores, national monuments and other designations.) The Golden Gate National Recreation Area was the most popular place in the national parks system, with more than 14 million visitors last year, pushing Blue Ridge Parkway and its nearly 13 million visitors into the No. 2 spot. Great Smoky Mountains National Park came in third place. Of the 59 specially designated national parks, Great Smoky Mountains was the most visited, with more than 9 million visitors. Grand Canyon National Park came in second place, with more than 4 million visitors. Yosemite came in third place with more than 3 million visitors. 50 spots, 50 states for 2014 . Impact of the government shutdown . Nearly 8 million of the 9 million visitor decrease came from the 16-day shutdown, according to park service analysis. Bad weather throughout the year also caused some park sites to close. They included Superstorm Sandy-related closures at the Statue of Liberty, Ellis Island, Castle Clinton and parts of Gateway National Recreation Area. Weather also caused shutdowns at the Blue Ridge Parkway. With vacations, weddings and other celebrations canceled in and around the parks because of the shutdown, local economies also felt the economic pinch last year. The year before, national parks across the country generated nearly $27 billion in economic activity and supported 243,000 jobs, according to a park service analysis of 2012 visitor data published March 3. States help reopen some parks . That's probably why states such as Arizona, Colorado, New York, South Dakota, Tennessee and Utah spent their money to pay to keep some of their national parks open during the shutdown, National Park Service Director Jonathan Jarvis said. ""For every dollar spent at the national parks, there's a $10 return to the local economy,"" Jarvis said, including spending at local hotels, restaurants and outfitters. The park service cannot pay the states back unless Congress appropriates the money through legislation, Jarvis said.

"(CNN) -- There are promising signs that the Department of Education and the Department of Justice might be getting serious about holding for-profit colleges accountable after so many of them have deceived students for years. The devious practices of one of the country's largest for-profit colleges finally caught up with it in June after years of accusations of inflated job placement rates, abysmally low graduation rates, high loan default rates and more when Corinthian Colleges reached a deal with the Department of Education to shut down its operations. In exchange for $16 million in operating funds, Corinthian -- the parent company of Everest University, Everest University Online, Wyotech, and Heald College -- agreed to sell off or close its more than 100 campuses across the country, while at the same time denying the allegations. Then, this month, the company announced it had received a grand jury subpoena from the U.S. attorney's office in Los Angeles, where the for-profit is based and where nearly a fourth of the school's 107 campuses are located. The subpoena, which indicates a possible federal criminal investigation, requests the company turn over documents on its job placement rates, graduation rates, and materials used in marketing and recruitment. Now, as Corinthian winds down its operations, the Department of Education needs to make sure no student is left struggling after the demise of this institution. The 72,000 students trapped on Corinthian's sinking ship are some of our nation's neediest. Like many for-profit schools, Corinthian targeted students who are overwhelmingly minority, female and low income. They are veterans back from Iraq and Afghanistan -- Corinthian received $186 million in post-9/11 GI bill funds in 2012 -- blue-collar workers seeking to improve their skill sets, and single mothers who hope more education will help them provide for their children. Over and over again, for-profit colleges like Corinthian have failed these students by promising a quick path to financial stability through vocational education programs. But in reality, these schools are notorious for charging exorbitant tuition without preparing students for jobs in the real world. On average, tuition at for-profit colleges is four to six times higher than at a comparable public school. A two-year Senate investigation found a medical assistant diploma cost $22,275 at Corinthian's Heald College in Fresno, California, while the same program at Fresno City College costs $1,650. An undergraduate certificate in paralegal studies at the Anaheim campus of Everest Colleges costs more than $43,000. At the Anaheim area community college, an associate's degree in paralegal studies costs less than $3,000. And students at for-profit colleges generally cannot transfer credits because the schools lack the accreditation recognized by traditional community and four-year colleges. Without a job or the ability to transfer credits, students at for-profit colleges all too often find themselves unable to repay their loans; for-profit college students represent just 11% of federal loan borrowers, yet account for nearly 50% of loan defaulters. Many of these issues apply to the deal with Corinthian, and students are being left in limbo. Depending on the accreditation each campus has, Corinthian students may not be able to transfer the credits they've already earned. Most unbelievably, the Department of Education continues to allow some Corinthian college locations to enroll studentsâ€”without meaningfully disclosing that the school is in the process of being sold off. The very arm of the government that should be protecting students is aiding the profiteers in a bait and switch. Corinthian has a long record as one of the worst players in the for-profit education industry. In 2012, when the Department of Education released the first metrics to determine the success of career college programs, 44 of Corinthian's programs failed outright. In fact, Corinthian Colleges performed worse than any other for-profit chain. But because a lawsuit prevented those metrics from being enforced, Corinthian's practices and programs continued unabated. Last year, the Securities and Exchange Commission and Consumer Financial Protection Bureau announced investigations of the company's lending practices. Earlier this year, the Department of Education asked Corinthian to document its job placement and graduation rates, and when the documentation never arrived, the department delayed the release of financial aid to Corinthian's students. Despite taking $1.4 billion from the federal government in 2012 alone, Corinthian can't keep its doors open. It is also under investigation for deceptive practices by the attorneys general of California and Massachusetts. Last August, I represented the Mississippi Center for Justice and other low-income legal services providers on a Department of Education committee that proposed regulations to bring greater accountability to the for-profit college industry. Our committee worked hard to add teeth to the rules that govern for-profit colleges, but industry trade groups began to pressure the Department of Education to water down those standards. The collapse of Corinthian makes clear just how important these new regulations are. If meaningful regulations had already been in place, it's quite likely that many of the 72,000 Corinthian students wouldn't be facing such tremendous uncertainty today. While we can't fix the past, we can make steps to start protecting students now. For those students enrolled at schools that the for-profit is selling, the Department of Education must ensure that the buyer will allow students to complete their degrees. It should not allow sale of the company to another failing school offering unmarketable degrees. Otherwise, the Corinthian problem will not be solved by the shut down -- it will simply be a name change. Corinthian and other similar colleges have made a profit for decades off the backs of students. As a nation, we must say ""enough.""","Whitney Barkley: Government is at last making for-profit colleges accountable .

"(CNN) -- Four years ago, Brandon Stanton became New York City's unofficial photo-chronicler. With his blog, Humans of New York -- which has over eight million followers on social media -- he has captured the heart and soul of the city's multi-national inhabitants. His trademark -- the micro narratives that accompany each image -- has been imitated in the far reaches of the globe, from Sydney to Khartoum. Last month, he turned his lens, and poignant interview style, to the world at large. In partnership with the United Nations, he is touring roughly a dozen countries in a bid to raise awareness for the peacekeeping organization's Millennium Development Goals. His first stop: Iraq and Jordan. 'My eyes were opened' Though his trip was ""months in the works,"" Stanton didn't anticipate that his arrival in Erbil, Iraq would coincide with that of ISIS. The first people he questioned were Yazidi refugees who had only freshly fled their homes, their families, their lives as a whole. ""My idea of what constitutes personal tragedy has been expanded a lot just listening to what these people are going through,"" admits Stanton. For the Yazidis he approached -- from the student who had to abandon his long sought after Master's degree to flee bombs to the mother whose children can't stop crying for home -- Stanton found himself falter at the prospect of pursuing his traditional line of questioning. ""When you've just abandoned your house, and your family is surrounded by a hostile army, and you don't know if they're going to survive, it's just inappropriate to ask what your happiest memory with your mother is,"" he says. ""I felt I couldn't ask them beyond their present circumstances, because their lives were absolutely consumed by those circumstances."" 'Pack a bag and get ready to run' The day Stanton landed in Iraq, ISIS captured the Mosul Dam. The day he left, the United States started air strikes. His time there, he admits, was often terrifying. ""When I was in Dohuk, there was a moment I got a call in the middle of the night from UNICEF telling to pack a bag and get ready to run, because ISIS was shelling the town and had broken through the lines,"" he recalls. ""It was an abundance of caution it turned out, but it was a sleepless night."" It was one of many moments, he admits, when he appreciated what it means to feel secure. ""I went to this place where all people wanted was a bit of security: to send their kids to school, to start a business, to get married and live a normal life. And I realized that in the absence of physical security, no other layers of life can really be experienced,"" he says. ""That constant uncertainty seeps into your psyche in a way that you can't really pinpoint until you go back to a place that is secure."" For Stanton, that place was Jordan. ""I really noticed when I landed in Jordan, where the infrastructures was in place and there was no imminent threat, that there was a load lifted from my psyche,"" he says. The stories he heard were different as well. The tenor, though often still heart-breaking (he visited Zaatari Refugee Camp that houses around 80,000 Syrians), demonstrated a lighter side of the human character. In the absence of immediate danger, there was hope. ""The other thing this trip has made me realize is the depth of ambition, particularly in underdeveloped countries,"" he says. ""Everybody I talked to had such big dreams, and often such limited opportunities with which to achieve those dreams.""","Brandon Stanton launched Humans of New York blog .

"(CNN) -- On perhaps this year's most compelling drama, the credits have yet to roll. Many have described that drama -- a story, apparently directed by North Korea, of Sony Pictures being hacked in retribution for a movie our foreign adversary considered an affront -- as novel. It is not. While this cyberattack is notable for how much it took place in public view, the offensive use of cyber-weapons is far from new. Sony is, in fact, just the latest victim in a recent, escalating spate of such attacks aimed at undermining our economic and national security interests. Examples are numerous, and the damage to our economic and national interests has been severe. Our financial institutions have been repeatedly targeted by criminal enterprises acting with impunity and at the direction of countries like Russia and Iran, according to news reports. Our defense sector has seen a barrage of attacks aimed at siphoning off information that will undermine our nation's security. Reports have detailed a Chinese hacking enterprise traceable to a single, government-run building in Shanghai. And a Department of Justice's indictment against five members of China's People's Liberation Army reveals specifics of China's attempts to infiltrate and steal intellectual property from businesses in several industrial sectors. The theft of intellectual property through cyber-espionage has been called ""the greatest transfer of wealth in history,"" and cyber-crime and espionage reportedly cost the global economy $445 billion annually. Recent reports have, moreover, confirmed that our nation's energy grid is critically vulnerable. The Sony attack made headlines in part because it revealed Hollywood secrets and celebrity squabbles that were fodder for celebrity gossip and well-suited for tabloid spectacle. But that doesn't make the damage any less serious. These ruthless cyberattacks damaged a company's reputation, opened the door to uncertain legal liabilities, and made light of our nation's copyright and intellectual property laws. They shattered any notion we may have had about our personal data and private communications remaining private. We should all be troubled by Sony's decision to entirely cancel the release of the film ""The Interview"" in response to threats of physical violence by belligerent hackers. Simply put: When decisions like this are made, America's enemies win. But make no mistake: Our enemies are emboldened by this administration's failure to develop and adequately resource a comprehensive cyber-strategy and respond decisively to increasingly sophisticated and motivated cyber-adversaries. Congress must pass meaningful cyber-legislation that allows our private sector and government to cooperate and share information that can be used to halt attacks before damage is done. We need, as a nation, to establish norms on what is permissible in cyberspace and ensure that law enforcement has the tools it needs to hold cyber-criminals, whether hacktivists or nation-states, accountable for their harm, . When Congress returns in January, I will work to make cyber-security a top priority. If elected Chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, I will establish a subcommittee focused on overseeing military cyber-programs, operations and activities. This is Hollywood's moment in the cyber-victim spotlight. The nation must transform these events into momentum to revise our strategy and improve our capabilities against such threats.

"An internal Veterans Affairs audit released Monday said tens of thousands of newly returning veterans wait at least 90 days for medical care, while even more who signed up in the VA system over the past 10 years never got an immediate appointment they requested. The review provides a more complete picture of widespread problems at the agency's health care facilities -- as reported by CNN over the past seven months -- than preliminary findings last month that led to the resignation of Veterans Affairs Secretary Eric Shinseki. ""This data shows the extent of the systemic problems we face, problems that demand immediate actions,"" said acting VA Secretary Sloan Gibson, who took over after Shinseki stepped aside. Deadly waits . Reports of the sometimes fatal waits, with the VA acknowledging 23 deaths nationwide due to delayed care, sparked public anger over problems at the VA that have existed for years. Despite efforts to address some issues in recent years, including reductions in backlogs for benefits and the number of homeless veterans, the long waits have continued for newly enrolled veterans to get initial appointments for care. Reasons for the chronic problems include the increasing number of veterans returning from wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, and a bonus system that rewarded managers for meeting goals regarding access to treatment. 14-day goal ""not attainable"" The audit findings, covering 731 VA facilities nationwide and based on interviews with more than 3,700 staff members, said a 14-day goal for providing care to newly enrolled veterans proved ""simply not attainable"" due to growing demand and a lack of capacity. ""Imposing this expectation on the field before ascertaining the resources required and its ensuing broad promulgation represent an organizational leadership failure,"" it said of the deadline imposed under Shinseki. According to CNN's previous reporting, managers in Phoenix and elsewhere used secret waiting lists to cover up the amount of time it took for veterans to get appointments. ""In some cases, pressures were placed on schedulers to utilize unofficial lists or engage in inappropriate practices in order to make waiting times appear more favorable,"" said a fact sheet released with the audit. At the same time, the audit said that questions it posed ""were not worded to ascertain the reason that policy may have been violated,"" adding that its findings ""cannot be extended to identify deliberate deception, fraud, or malfeasance."" Keyword search the audit . The figures in the audit -- 57,436 newly enrolled veterans facing a minimum 90-day wait for medical care; 63,869 veterans who enrolled over the past decade requesting an appointment that never happened -- show the scope of the problem. At the same time, both figures represent about 1% of the total 6 million or so appointments in the VA system now, and don't reflect possible changing circumstances, such as enrolled veterans who seek care at a different facility than the one where they first  signed up. Gibson's statement said the VA has contacted 50,000 veterans ""to get them off of wait lists and into clinics"" so far, and planned to contact another 40,000. Steps taken . Other steps he announced included: . •Removing the 14-day scheduling goal. •Suspending all performance awards for VHA senior executives for fiscal year 2014, which runs through September. •A  hiring freeze at VA central headquarters in Washington and the 21 VHA regional offices, ""except for critical positions to be approved by the secretary on a case-by-case basis."" •A new patient satisfaction measurement program. •Ordering an independent, outside audit of VHA scheduling practices across the system. This would differ from a review being conducted by the VA inspector general's office. •Applying reforms announced for the Phoenix VA facility to others considered the ""most challenged."" •Deploying mobile medical units to provide services to veterans awaiting care. CNN first reported the extensive problems at the Phoenix VA facility, including an interview with a whistleblower who said dozens of veterans died while waiting for care there. Fatal waits in Phoenix . Changes needed . White House spokesman Josh Earnest said the new audit showed ""some personnel changes need to be made and some have already,"" in reference to Shinseki's departure and some top managers in Phoenix placed on administrative leave. ""It's also clear there need to be some management changes in terms of ... the procedures that the VA has in place to fulfill their responsibilities,"" Earnest said. Some in Congress on both sides of the aisle have called for a criminal investigation, and 21 senators sent a letter Monday to Attorney General Eric Holder asking for the FBI to get involved. ""This challenge requires resources that only the Department of Justice can provide in developing and assessing evidence, pursuing leads, and initiating active prosecutions aggressively if warranted,"" said the letter from 10 Republicans and 11 Democrats. Bring in the feds . The signers included Kay Hagan in North Carolnia, Mary Landrieu of Louisiana and Mark Pryor of Arkansas -- Democrats from traditionally conservative states who face tough re-election battles in November. Richard Griffin, the acting VA inspector general conducting his own review of the system, has said he regularly consults with the Justice Department as part of his inquiry. A Justice spokesperson said Monday that ""the department continues to consult with the Veterans Affairs Office of Inspector General regarding their ongoing review."" Declining further comment on an ""ongoing matter,"" the spokesperson said the department ""often consults with inspectors general on legal matters and acts on any referrals should they find sufficient predicate for a criminal investigation.""

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Be excited, but be scared. A world of mind-blowing possibilities is suddenly being thrust upon the world of video gaming. Detecting your thoughts: the EPOC headset is a breakthrough in brain - computer interfaces. The era of thought controlled games has arrived, and soon you could be required only to 'think' to operate a video game. Maybe you'll even have the chance to be completely immersed in a video game 'world'. The Emotiv EPOC headset - the first Brain Computer Interface (BCI) device for the gaming market is the technology behind the revolution -- and the company claims to have already mastered thought control. The EPOC detects and processes real time brain activity patterns (small voltage changes in the brain caused by the firing of neurons) using a device that measures electric activity in the brain. In total, it picks up over 30 different expressions, emotions and actions. The leap in technology has been met with excitement amongst many gamers. Singapore enthusiast Samuel Lau has even made a video showing his hopes for the future of gaming. But, for the creators, what possibilities does this open up for future video games?  View gallery of gaming through the years » . According to experts, the sci-fi scenarios depicted in The Matrix, and Star Trek's 'Holodeck' are now comprehendible realities in the future. President and co-founder of Emotiv Systems, Tan Le, said the brain-to-computer interface was undoubtedly the future for video games. ""Being able to control a computer with your mind is the ultimate quest of human-machine interaction. When integrated into games, virtual worlds and other simulated environments, this technology will have a profound impact on the user's experience."" What do you think video games of the future will look like? Le envisaged the lines between games and reality continuing to blur. ""In the long run, the user's interactions with machines will more closely mimic our interactions with other humans. Our technology will ultimately bring communities of people closer together to richly share their experiences,"" he said. Rick Hall, production director at the Florida Interactive Entertainment Academy, is also open-minded about possibilities in future gaming. Hall, who has worked across machines such as the N64, Sony PSP, PS2, and Nintendo DS, told CNN that some of the concepts in The Matrix were now ""eerily reaching towards theoretical possibility"". ""If we can interpret basic control thoughts now, it isn't far off where we'll be able to interpret more complex thoughts, even potentially things you're not consciously thinking of. If we can now do it in a non-invasive fashion, it probably won't be long before we can read these things from across the room. And if we can ""read"" complex thoughts, then shouldn't we also be able to ""write"" thoughts into a person's brain? ""So add that up: a wireless, remote, brain reading/writing device that can scan, interpret, and communicate with someone across the room, without them even knowing it. Connect that to the Internet... and talk about brainwashing possibilities. What if some hacker could figure out how to write viruses to people's brains? It's actually a little scary."" But, it's not all optimism and imagination for the technology. American gaming analyst Todd Greenwald believes it may be some time yet before brain to computer interfaces reach a marketable standard, saying it is ""a bit too far out and speculative to say with any confidence"". University of Ulster video gaming lecturer Darryl Charles told CNN he was also uncertain whether Emotiv's technology would take off. ""It's a little bit harder to see. It's quite a complex thing to force your thought on a television screen."" However, Emotiv's Le strongly defended the headset, saying it ""works on a vast majority of people and can adapt to a wide variety of thought patterns. Emotiv has carried out tests with hundreds of people and so far we have had success on every single person,"" Le said. While the speed of the revolution pushing the gaming world is hotly debated, one thing all experts agree on is the underlying themes of future games. Gamers can be certain that social interaction and strong storylines will strengthen to form the core of games. Tan Le told CNN, ""The one thing that we believe will be core to the future of gaming is the social experience. Nothing a game developer can program can match the random nature of actually participating in a scenario with other live people."" Le said the social aspect was the key to growth of the industry, as it was opening the door to fresh markets. He acknowledged the new level of immersion offered with the Wii's interactive control had helped send the industry in the right direction. Charles believed a move closer towards the movie and television entertainment realm was also imminent. ""The big blockbuster game is going to compete more with Hollywood movies. They will be a lot more competitive in storylines... there is a lot of production values already coming from cinema."" Greenwald said downloading games straight from the producer could soon become a reality. A market where simple games could be downloaded for free and then add-ons to significantly improve the game were sold at a premium, could be a more financially rewarding for the makers, he said.","EPOC headset by Emotiv allows users to 'think' and video characters will 'do'

"(CNN) -- Let's be clear about this: The embargo on Cuba should have been lifted a long time ago. And yet it's hard to avoid the impression that although President Barack Obama had an overwhelmingly strong hand in negotiations, he played it badly. Badly, that is, for the sake of the Cuban people. What occurred on Wednesday, and the Obama administration's announcement of a momentous change in U.S. policy toward Cuba, is certainly important to the United States. But it means even more to Cuba -- it is a major landmark in the country's history, one of the most pivotal events since the takeover of the government by Fidel Castro and his band of revolutionary brothers in 1959. For decades the Castro regime -- first under Fidel and now under his brother Raul -- have made the lifting of the U.S. embargo, ""the blockade"" as they call it, a centerpiece of their rhetorical arsenal and their principal demand in domestic and international forums. Now, United States has agreed to work toward lifting the embargo and normalizing diplomatic relations. Yet despite Washington having significant leverage as the Cuban economy teeters and low oil prices threaten to sever its Venezuelan lifeline, the United States secured virtually no meaningful concessions. Cuba remains one of the world's most politically oppressive countries. At the very least, therefore, the agreement to restore relations should have included substantial commitments on Havana's part to relax the state's grip. But it did not. Of course, the release of the unjustly incarcerated Alan Gross is welcome. But his release should have been viewed not as a bargaining chip, but as a prerequisite to any deal at all. Instead, there was a separate exchange of spies, which Cuba treated as a major victory. The only concession that has been reported upon is Havana's agreement to release about 50 imprisoned dissidents. This leaves millions of Cubans still under the thumb of a repressive state. With that in mind, the main goal of U.S. policy toward Havana should be helping the Cuban people live in prosperity and freedom, able to enjoy the benefits of modernity, complete with the right to free expression and participation in the global economy. By beginning to lift the embargo, material conditions in Cuba are likely to improve -- and that is most welcome -- but the process of introducing political freedoms may or may not advance. It's not surprising that the agreement was judged with skepticism by many pro-democracy activists in Cuba. The dean of Cuban dissidents, Elizardo Sanchez, reportedly declared, ""Castrismo has won."" He welcomed the renewal of dialogue but told Radio France Internationale he foresees no improvement in human rights as the result of the deal. The leader of the opposition group Ladies in White, Berta Soler, called Obama's decision a mistake, adding that ""democracy and freedom for the Cuban people aren't going to be achieved by what Obama has given to the Cuban government."" Barely a week ago that repression was in full view of the Cuban people and a smattering of foreign journalists in Havana. On December 10, Human Rights Day, a familiar scene unfolded in Havana as authorities took away would-be peaceful demonstrators before they had a chance to assemble even in small numbers. At least 240 people were arrested, according to one dissident group. Human Rights Watch, for its part, says the government continues to use beatings, public shaming and intimidation against regime critics, adding that arbitrary arrests have ""increased dramatically in recent years."" Indeed, I've witnessed such incidents myself over the course of at least a dozen trips to Cuba over the years, watching plainclothes agents and regime thugs beat up anyone even daring to utter the word ""democracy."" True, not everyone in Cuba is pessimistic. Many of those who have struggled under grinding economic difficulties understandably just want to see their standard of living improve, and there is excitement on the island and hope that major economic changes could be around the corner. Yet welcome as improving economic well-being is, it would be tragic if this unique chance to usher in freedom is lost. The sight of Raul Castro -- the aging, unelected Cuban leader -- wearing his military uniform as he announced on television that Washington and Havana will restore ties ""without renouncing any of our principles"" reminded me of a conversation I had with a Cuban Ministry of Foreign Affairs official back when communist regimes were collapsing around the world. He told me that he thought Cuba would seek to follow a Chinese model, meaning that like China's Communist Party, the Cuban regime would try to keep its grip on power, even if its socialist economic model is conclusively proven to have failed. Will Cuba choose that path? Certainly, Obama had the opportunity to nudge the country off this course, and instead toward freedom. In fact, it is not too late for his administration to do so. So, as the United States moves to dismantle the old, failed embargo, let's hope it plays its hand with greater skill on behalf of the Cuban people moving forward, and extracts from the government verifiable progress on human rights and individual freedoms. It is time to help Cuba and its people rejoin the modern world.","Frida Ghitis: Embargo on Cuba should have been lifted a long time ago .

"Today, the Ebola virus spreads only through direct contact with bodily fluids, such as blood and vomit. But some of the nation's top infectious disease experts worry that this deadly virus could mutate and be transmitted just by a cough or a sneeze. ""It's the single greatest concern I've ever had in my 40-year public health career,"" said Dr. Michael Osterholm, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota. ""I can't imagine anything in my career -- and this includes HIV -- that would be more devastating to the world than a respiratory transmissible Ebola virus."" The World Health Organization says its scientists are unaware of any virus that has dramatically changed its mode of transmission. ""For example, the H5N1 avian influenza virus... has probably circulated through many billions of birds for at least two decades. Its mode of transmission remains basically unchanged. Speculation that Ebola virus disease might mutate into a form that could easily spread among humans through the air is just that: speculation, unsubstantiated by any evidence."" Osterholm and other experts couldn't think of another virus that has made the transition from non-airborne to airborne in humans. They say the chances are relatively small that Ebola will make that jump. But as the virus spreads, they warned, the likelihood increases. Every time a new person gets Ebola, the virus gets another chance to mutate and develop new capabilities. Osterholm calls it ""genetic roulette."" As of October 1, there have been more than 7,100 cases of Ebola, with 3,330 deaths, according to the World Health Organization, which has said the virus is spreading at a much faster rate than it was earlier in the outbreak. Ebola is an RNA virus, which means every time it copies itself, it makes one or two mutations. Many of those mutations mean nothing, but some of them might be able to change the way the virus behaves inside the human body. ""Imagine every time you copy an essay, you change a word or two. Eventually, it's going to change the meaning of the essay,"" said Dr. C.J. Peters, one of the heroes featured in ""The Hot Zone."" The roots of our Ebola fears . That book chronicles the 1989 outbreak of Ebola Reston, which was transmitted among monkeys by breathing. In 2012, Canadian researchers found that Ebola Zaire, which is involved in the current outbreak, was passed from pigs to monkeys in the air. Dr. James Le Duc, the director of the Galveston National Laboratory at the University of Texas, said the problem is that no one is keeping track of the mutations happening across West Africa, so no one really knows what the virus has become. One group of researchers looked at how Ebola changed over a short period of time in just one area in Sierra Leone early on in the outbreak, before it was spreading as fast as it is now. They found more than 300 genetic changes in the virus. ""It's frightening to look at how much this virus mutated within just three weeks,"" said Dr. Pardis Sabeti, an associate professor at Harvard and senior associate member of the Broad Institute, where the research was done. Even without becoming airborne, the virus has overwhelmed efforts to stop it. Funerals, ghost towns and haunted health workers . Osterholm commended groups like Doctors Without Borders but said uncoordinated efforts by individual organizations are no match for Ebola spreading swiftly through urban areas. ""This is largely dysfunctional. Nobody's in command, and nobody's in charge,"" he said. ""It's like not having air traffic control at an airport. The planes would just crash into each other.""","Experts fear that Ebola will mutate and become spreadable via cough or sneeze .

"China has accused the United States of ""hypocrisy"" and ""double standards"" following its decision to charge five Chinese army officers with cybertheft against major American businesses. The Foreign Ministry in Beijing even took the step of summoning U.S. Ambassador Max Baucus late Monday, the state-run Xinhua news agency reported, as tensions between the two countries threatened to escalate into a full-scale diplomatic incident. Earlier Monday, U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder announced that the men, all members of the People's Liberation Army (PLA), ""maintained unauthorized access to victim computers to steal information from these entities that would be useful"" to the victims' competitors in China. Holder said some of the ""victims"" included U.S. Steel Corp., Westinghouse, Alcoa, Allegheny Technologies, the United Steel Workers Union and SolarWorld. In an unusual move, the men were named in the indictment document as Wang Dong, Sun Kailiang, Wen Xinyu, Huang Zhenyu and Gu Chunhui. These are the first charges against Chinese state officials for what the U.S. says is a widespread problem, U.S. officials told CNN before Holder's remarks. But in a written statement Tuesday, China's Foreign Ministry said ""it is widely known that the U.S. has for a long time been using its advanced technology and infrastructure to perpetrate large scale theft of secrets and eavesdropping against foreign political leaders, enterprises and individuals. ""From WikiLeaks to the (Edward) Snowden incident, the U.S. hypocrisy and double standards have been abundantly clear. The Chinese PLA has been a serious victim of this kind of behavior from the U.S. Statistics show that in recent years the PLA's international internet terminals have suffered a large number of attacks. IP addresses show that a large number of those attacks come from the U.S. ""China demands that the U.S. give a clear explanation of its internet theft of secrets and eavesdropping on China and immediately cease such activities."" On Monday, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson, Qin Gang, said the charges against its army officers were based on ""intentionally-fabricated facts"" that ""grossly violate the basic norms governing international relations,"" and urged Washington to ""immediately correct its mistakes and withdraw the indictments."" Qin also revealed China would be suspending its involvement in the joint China-U.S. Cyber Working Group, set up in April last year to work on measures to address cybersecurity -- an issue that has driven a wedge between the two governments in the past. What we know about the Chinese army's alleged cyber spying unit . President's concern . At a regular news briefing at the White House, press secretary Jay Carney was asked about Monday's developments. ""This is an issue that has been brought up by President Obama with (Chinese) President Xi (Jinping) in their meetings as recently as in March as a general problem that we have seen and reflects the president's overall concern about cybersecurity,"" Carney said. ""We have consistently and candidly raised these concerns with the Chinese government, and today's announcement reflects our growing concern that this Chinese behavior has continued."" He was adamant that the U.S. ""intelligence programs serve a specific national security mission, and that does not include providing a competitive advantage to U.S. companies or U.S. economic interests,"" Carney said. ""In other words, we do not do what those Chinese nationals were indicted for earlier today. Period."" A spokeswoman for the State Department told reporters that Washington wants to have more dialogue with Beijing about the issue. ""We remain deeply concerned about Chinese government-sponsored, cyber-enabled theft of trade secrets and other sensitive business information for commercial gain,"" Jen Psaki said. ""And, again, this was specific to the actions of ... of just a few individuals. And we hope that the Chinese government can understand that."" Impacts real people . This was a law enforcement case, she added, not a diplomatic one. ""We continue to believe --  and this is relevant to us, our role here at the State Department -- that we can have a constructive and productive relationship with China,"" she said. ""We're ready to work with China to prevent these types of activities from continuing."" Joining Holder, David Hickton, U.S. Attorney for the Western District of Pennsylvania, said the alleged hacking has caused the victimized U.S. companies to lose capital investments in research and technology. He added that the ""important message"" is that cyberespionage ""impacts real people in real and painful ways,"" he said. ""The lifeblood of any organization is the people who work, strive and sweat for it. When these cyberintrusions occur, production slows, plants close, workers get laid off and lose their homes,"" Hickton said. ""Hacking, spying and cybertheft for commercial advantage can and will be prosecuted criminally even when the defendants are state actors,"" he said.","China Foreign Ministry spokesman calls on U.S. to withdraw charges .

"(CNN) -- In the sparse hinterland of Africa's southernmost nation plans are afoot to boldly take the continent where it has never gone before -- the deepest reaches of outer space. It's here, in South Africa's Karoo desert, that construction is scheduled to begin on the Square Kilometer Array, a cluster of 3,000 satellites working in tandem over a square kilometer area. This highly sensitive collective of dishes and antennas will combine to act as a giant radio telescope -- the biggest in the world when built, according to the SKA Organization -- probing the dark heart of space. An accompanying selection of array and aperture antennas, meanwhile, will provide continuous coverage of radio waves between 70 MhZ and 10 GhZ that penetrate the earth's atmosphere. Scientists hope the project will shed further light on the mysteries posed by the likes of quasars, dark matter and black holes. According to Phil Diamond, Director-General of the SKA Organisation, the project could even enable scientists to ""pick up signals from extraterrestrials"" should they exist, although this isn't the projects primary objective. There's also the exciting possibility of capturing information on how the universe evolved in its earliest moments. The space effect . For science, the prize is clearly huge. A full budget for the SKA is yet to be confirmed but construction is slated to begin by 2018. Given the scale of the project, which has the backing of 11 member countries, some have even dubbed the SKA astronomy's version of the Large Hadron Collider. For South Africa and the wider African continent, there are also many ancillary benefits. The SKA -- an international affair -- is headquartered in the UK with the telescope itself planned for a ""dual site"" location in Australia and South Africa. Distant stations will also be set up in Botswana, Kenya, Madagascar, Mauritius, Mozambique, Namibia, Zambia and Ghana. SKA South Africa is also building the MeerKAT radio telescope, which will act as a precursor to the SKA and later be integrated into the larger telescope. The construction, observation and upkeep of these facilities will provide skilled jobs for local people. SKA South Africa project director Bernie Fanaroff, meanwhile, says that the telescope array will generate more data in a day than already exists on the entire internet. As such, new computer software and programs that can pinpoint relevant data and allow humans to interact with it in a simple and time-efficient manner are currently being developed. Given the increasing importance of ""big data"" collection and analysis across a host of contemporary industries, South Africa's government is taking a calculated risk that the technologies underpinning these systems will find further commercial use both in Africa and beyond. Economic benefits . For the Rainbow Nation, these are clearly exciting and potentially lucrative developments to be a part of. ""South Africa wants to move away from being resource heavy economy to bring young people into science and technology,"" explains Fanaroff. ""Building the SKA ... is a way of emphasizing and getting people to accept that science and tech is a key part of development."" This is a point of view that Dr Sandile Malinga, head of the South African National Space Agency, strongly concurs with. He points to successful SANSA programs currently underway -- including the development and launch of satellites that provide data used to inform government decisions on security, agriculture and environmental protection -- which prove the benefits of serious investment in a modern space program. The agency also gave help to NASA's Mars Curiosity Mission during launch in 2011. ""(There are) endless possibilities through innovation and new technologies, which may be replicated on earth,"" Malinga says. ""The necessary knowledge and skills developed through such missions will open doors for our people to position themselves equally on the global space stage and even bring in external funding to our countries thus boosting the economies,"" he adds. The African space race . South Africa isn't the only African nation thinking along these lines. Nigeria, Morocco, Tunisia, Algeria and Egypt have all established space and satellite programs with similar aims. Ghana, Uganda, Angola, Ethiopia and Kenya, meanwhile, have voiced their commitment to follow suit. Some observers question whether the underlying infrastructure to enable these ambitions to flourish in the long term is currently in place. Calestous Juma, a Harvard University professor and co-chair of the African Union's High-Level Panel on Science, Technology and Innovation, told CNN that while it is right that African nations invest in space technology they must do so in a thoughtful and strategic manner. He points to the importance of focusing on education and inspiring future generations to become scientists and engineers, to create valuable and highly skilled workforces. ""What we don't want is vanity space programs,"" Juma said. ""As it stands, I think they are focusing more on the space programs and less on the education ... (space programs) have to be designed as a capability program otherwise the economic return will not be fully realized."" While this may be the case for some African nations, Fanaroff says that since 2005 South Africa has issued some 600 grants in their human capacity development program, covering ""everything from research chairs down to artisan training."" ""We're putting a lot of young people through a pipeline where we're trying to take them into astronomy and physics or engineering in their first or second year of university and taking them all the way through to post-doctoral fellowships. That's starting to work quite well,"" adds Fanaroff. Aid and space . Despite his concerns about infrastructure, Calestous Juma is enthusiastic about the broader aims of developing space programs on the continent. There are others, however, who say that African nations should focus more on providing for the basic needs of their populations than on the luxury of space investment. South Africa has one of the largest gaps between rich and poor globally, with millions living in shanty towns -- although earlier this year, the government reported that the population living in extreme poverty has dropped by 2.4 million since 2006. Egypt has been wracked by political instability and violence since former president of 30 years, Hosni Mubarak was forced to resign by protesters in 2011 and the subsequent overthrow in 2013 of President Mohamed Morsy in a military coup. And in Nigeria, some regions boast the unenviable record of having 60% of their population living in extreme poverty. Matthew Sinclair from the British Taxpayers Alliance body was quoted by the UK's Independent newspaper in 2013 asking why his country was sending money to provide development assistance to nations like Nigeria and South Africa when they are investing in space technologies. ""If a foreign government has enough cash to invest in an ambitious space program, it should not expect to be receiving cash from the UK,"" Sinclair said. Colonial thinking . The likes of Malinga and Fanaroff, however, have little time for these suggestions. ""This is an argument we hear often and is largely as a result of the public not being able to make the link between the benefits of space investment against addressing society's needs,"" Malinga says. ""Africa has immense challenges with poverty, hunger and access to potable water which can all be diminished through investment in space"" by providing valuable data that can make public policy more efficient, for example. On top of this, ""innovations that arise from the 'out-of-the-box' thinking that space encourages will impact on growing local economies and create opportunities for Africans in the global market,"" he adds. Fanaroff, however, is more withering in his riposte. ""We don't accept that South Africa has to remain on the edge of civilization. That we don't accept, that's the old colonial way of thinking,"" Fanaroff says. ""For South Africa and Africa (this could be) the next great economic growth story,"" he adds. ""We will play a role in the future.""","The Square Kilometer Array is an ambitious radio telescope project .

"Famed boxer Muhammad Ali has ""vastly improved"" after being hospitalized over the weekend with a mild case of pneumonia, his spokesman Bob Gunnell said. ""Ali's team of doctors hopes to discharge him soon,"" said Gunnell. Ali, 72, was admitted to an undisclosed hospital on Saturday. ""The Ali family continues to request privacy and appreciates all of the prayers and well wishes,"" read a statement sent from Gunnell. Ali was born Cassius Clay and won an Olympic gold medal as a light-heavyweight at 18. In 1964, he became world heavyweight champion in an upset victory against then-champion Sonny Liston, according to Ali's official website. Shortly thereafter, he changed his name to Muhammad Ali to reflect his conversion to Islam. The boxer was also known for his protest against the Vietnam War and refusal to be drafted into service out of religious conviction. He retired from boxing in 1981 and announced his diagnosis with Parkinson's disease three years later.","Former world heavyweight champion Muhammad Ali has pneumonia .

"Florida State University quarterback Jameis Winston has been cleared by a school panel that considered whether he violated the student conduct code in relation to allegations that he sexually assaulted another student two years ago. Winston was not arrested in the alleged 2012 incident, but he faced a code-of-conduct violation charge for sexual misconduct in the university hearing. The independent hearing officer on the panel, Major B. Harding, ruled that ""in sum, the preponderance of the evidence has not shown that you are responsible for any of the charged violations of the code. ""Namely, I find that the evidence before me is insufficient to satisfy the burden of proof,"" the ruling says. Florida State's investigation was launched under Title IX, which requires schools to investigate allegations of sexual assault, even if criminal charges are never filed. Winston has denied the allegations throughout. Winston's attorneys have said the athlete had consensual sex with the woman. A lawyer for the accuser issued a strongly worded statement in response to the ruling. ""We are stunned and dismayed by the order,"" attorney John Clune said. ""It's not a 'decision' at all, but a statement that the judge couldn't decide."" Clune said that of the four people inside the apartment where the rape allegedly took place, only the accuser testified. Winston and two other football players who were there refused to testify ""and somehow Jameis Winston still wins."" The accuser's attorney's are considering an appeal, but for now, ""we feel a little duped,"" Clune said. Florida State President John Thrasher commended the work of Harding, a former chief justice of the Florida Supreme Court. ""He conducted a thorough Student Conduct Code hearing and reviewed more than 1,000 pages of evidence generated by three other investigations, and we would like to thank him sincerely for his service,"" Thrasher said. Winston, who won the Heisman trophy in 2013, led the Seminoles to an undefeated regular season and a place in the inaugural College Football Playoff.

"(CNN)Don't tell the kids, but we've got Santa Claus all wrong. Countless Christmas songs tell us that Santa is basically the Judge Judy of juveniles. He decides who's been naughty or nice, and doles out presents or punishments accordingly. But historians say Kris Kringle was originally created to keep adults, not children, off the naughty list. Being crafty codgers, we ducked Santa's surveillance, turning the spotlight on kids and dramatically changing Christmas celebrations. How did we achieve this very important historical victory? Picture this: It's the early 1800s, and America's Christian leaders -- most of whom were Protestant Reformation-types -- had banned religious celebrations of Christmas as unscriptural and paganish. But people still wanted to party. Because, why not? It was midwinter, the crops were harvested and sailors were waiting for better weather to disembark. So, on December 25, working-class stiffs got fall-down drunk and stumbled around cities looking for stuff to loot. Imagine Black Friday, spring break and New Year's Eve -- then smash them together like sumo wrestlers full of saki. That was Christmas in the early 1800s. A bunch of blue-blood New Yorkers decided all this fun must stop. ""They wanted to domesticate Christmas, bring it indoors, and focus it on children,"" says Gerry Bowler, author of ""Santa Claus: A History,"" and professor of history at the University of Manitoba in Canada. These grinches, who formed the Saint Nicholas Society of New York, would change the world with two little poems. Yep. Poems. But let's back up for a minute. When the Dutch came to the New World in the 1600s, they brought a fellow from folklore named Sinterklaas with them, Bowler says. Sinterklaas, who wore a red bishop's miter and a snowy white beard, was based on St. Nicholas, a 3rd century Greek who lived in modern-day Turkey. Despite being a bishop, this Nick was a bit of a bad boy. An archaeologist who dug up his bones in 2005 found that Nicholas had a broken nose, perhaps a result of the persistent persecution of Christians around that time, said Adam C. English, author of ""The Saint Who Would be Santa Claus."" Or could it have been Christian-on-Christian violence? According to one medieval legend, Nicholas punched a heretic in the nose at the Council of Nicea -- the meeting in 325 that formed the first consensus on Christian doctrine. Early icons of Nicholas depict him without bishop's garb, a subtle suggestion that he had been demoted, possibly for fisticuffs. Alas, the Nick at Nicea rumor is not true, said English. But people seem to love the story, which pops up like poinsettias on the Internet this time of year. Thankfully, St. Nicholas, was known for more than brawling. He also had a reputation for giving gifts and protecting children. The first quality comes from a story about a poor man with three young daughters. Without a dowry to offer suitors, the man worried that his daughters would fall into prostitution. Legend has it that Nicholas dropped three bags of gold through an open window in the man's house, saving the women from the streets. The second story is a bit macabre: While staying at an inn, Nicholas discovered three dismembered children in pickle barrels. He reassembled and resurrected the briny kids and punished the guilty innkeeper. These deeds, along with his everyman persona, (he wasn't a martyr or hermit like so many other model Christians of the time), made Nicholas the greatest male saint of the Middle Ages, said Bowler. One measure of his popularity is the looong list of people, places, churches and Christian groups that list St. Nick as their patron. Bowler, Santa's biographer, says that St. Nick's feast day, December 6, (the day he supposedly died) was celebrated across Europe for hundreds of years, often by giving gifts to children. But, beginning in the 1500s, the Protestant Reformation swept away the cult of Christian saints, denouncing them as unbiblical and idolatrous. Christmas, too, went pretty much by the wayside for much of Protestant Europe during this time. Some countries, though, such as the Netherlands, kept alive traditions associated with Sinterklaas. And it was these customs that 19th century New Yorkers wanted to revive. As they sought to make Christmas more family friendly, the Saint Nicholas Society found the perfect front man in their namesake, who, after all, was known for being nice to children. It was a genius move. The real goal was getting drunks off the street, remember? Now they could do that by turning Christmas into a family event when children -- who had it pretty rough back then -- would receive gifts for good behavior. But the Knickerbockers needed more than good cheer to change Christmas. They needed stories. Drawing on the Dutch legends about Sinterklaas, the American author Washington Irving wrote a series of sketches featuring St. Nicholas soaring high above New York houses, smoking a pipe and delivering presents to well-behaved children. About a decade later, in 1821, an anonymous poem called ""The Children's Friend,"" featured a magical figure called ""Santeclaus,"" who drove a reindeer-led sleigh full of ""rewards"" and filled obedient children's stockings with little presents. Building on that, an Episcopalian scholar named Clement Clarke Moore wrote a poem for his big brood called ""A Visit From St. Nicholas.""  It's now better known as ""The Night Before Christmas."" Strangely for a seminary professor, Moore's poem strips St. Nick of religious rhyme and reasons. Nicholas wears a fur suit, clambers down chimneys and gives presents to good children. But he says nothing about the ""reason for the season,"" as contemporary Christmas warriors like to say. Still, Moore's St. Nick story went viral, spreading across the northeastern United States faster than reindeer on Ritalin. In some early depictions, Santa Claus looks like an overgrown elf; in others, he looks kind of scary, as American artists merged St. Nicholas with European traditions such as the German Krampus, who punishes bad children. By the early 1900s, Bowler says, Santa became standardized as the white-bearded, red-suited, twinkle-eyed benevolent grandfather that we all know and love. And we're not the only ones. ""Merchants seized on this guy right away,"" Bowler says. ""They immediately saw the possibility that this personification could be useful in their selling."" In other words, Santa was pitching products almost as soon as he hitched up his sleigh. But before you blame Kris Kringle for commercializing Christmas, think back to what it was like before he came to town, when kids -- and many adults -- really had something to pout about.","In the early 1800s, Christmas in this country looked dramatically different .

"Havana, Cuba (CNN)It might be the most bizarre of the closely guarded secrets from last week's historic agreement between the United States and Cuba: How did the leader of a Cuban spy ring serving life in a California federal prison manage to impregnate his wife 2,245 miles away in Havana? As part of the most significant diplomatic breakthrough between the United States and Cuba in more than 50 years, a prisoner swap was made. To uphold its part of the bargain, the U.S. released three Cuban spies, including Gerardo Hernandez, the head of the spy ring known as the Wasp Network. Hernandez had an ear-to-ear smile Wednesday as he arrived at Havana's Jose Marti International Airport.  State TV showed Hernandez as he was greeted by President Raul Castro and then embraced and kissed his wife, Adriana Perez. Cubans watching the nonstop coverage of the prisoner swap were shocked when the cameras zeroed in on Hernandez hugging Perez. She was obviously in the late stages of a pregnancy that had no easy explanation. Not only had Hernandez been serving a double life sentence, but his wife also worked for Cuba's intelligence services and was banned by U.S. officials from visiting her husband in prison, according to the Cuban government. Rumors swirl in sultry Havana . The subject became the immediate hot topic in Havana where rumors swirled fast about the baby's paternity and whether the Cuban government could have somehow arranged a clandestine conjugal visit under the nose of U.S. authorities. The couple appeared at another event on Saturday, where together with the other freed spies, Castro and the communist island's top political and military officials showered them with applause. A beaming Hernandez stood by Perez, whose round stomach was clearly visible for viewers of the live broadcast . As the couple left the celebration, Hernandez hinted at the secret surrounding the pregnancy. ""Everyone's asking, and we have had a lot of fun with the comments and speculations. The reality is it had to be kept quiet,"" Hernandez told the government-run television channel. ""We can't give a lot of details, because we don't want to hurt people who meant well."" He said his wife's pregnancy was a direct result of the high-level talks. ""One of the first things accomplished by this process was this,"" Hernandez said, gesturing to his Perez's stomach. ""I had to do it by 'remote control,' but everything turned out well."" Two sources involved with the diplomatic talks, when questioned by CNN, uncloaked the mystery: During the negotiations, Hernandez's sperm was collected and sent to Cuba, where Perez was artificially inseminated. The U.S. Justice Department confirmed the story, without going into the details. ""We can confirm the United States facilitated Mrs. Hernandez's request to have a baby with her husband,"" spokesman Brian Fallon said. What the U.S. would gain . Why would the U.S. government do this? The artificial insemination was made possible in exchange for better conditions for Alan Gross, a U.S. contractor imprisoned in Cuba. Gross was released last week as part of the prisoner swap. ""In light of Mr. Hernandez's two life sentences,"" Fallon said, ""the request was passed along by Senator [Patrick] Leahy, who was seeking to improve the conditions for Mr. Gross while he was imprisoned in Cuba."" The discretion on both sides makes sense. For 18 months, officials from both countries refused to admit that they were even holding high-level talks. Officials communicated via back channels, knowing that any leak about the talks could doom the talks. Impregnating Perez involved cutting through bureaucratic red tape at multiple U.S. government agencies. As Perez began to show, officials from both countries fretted over how they would explain her pregnancy and what to do if the baby arrived before the talks succeeded. 2001 conviction . Hernandez was convicted in 2001 of conspiracy to commit murder for his role in the Brothers to the Rescue shoot down that left four Cuban-Americans dead after Cuban Air Force MIGs blew up the two civilian planes as they flew toward Havana to distribute anti-government leaflets. He received two life sentences. Cuban authorities said Hernandez and the other operatives were trying to prevent terrorist attacks from being carried out on their homeland by violent Miami exiles. That the U.S. government helped a man convicted of plotting the murder of four Cuban-Americans and spying on the exile community in Miami will likely further rankle many of the same Cuban-Americans who were already furious that Washington is restoring diplomatic relations with Havana. But Tim Reiser, an aide to Leahy who worked to broker the landmark agreement with Cuba, said helping Hernandez conceive a child led to better treatment for Gross by Cuban authorities and was an important concession to help reach a historic deal. ""The expectation was that this man would die in prison. This was her only chance of having a child,"" Rieser told CNN. Gerardo Hernandez said he and his wife are expecting their baby daughter to arrive in two weeks and they will name her Gema. Patrick Oppman reported and wrote from Havana, Cuba. Evan Perez reported from Washington.","Gerardo Hernandez was the head of the spy ring known as the Wasp Network .

"The number of Ebola cases in West Africa has not reached worst-case scenario predictions, but until it drops to zero, the world remains at risk, the CDC director said Monday. Speaking to reporters after a visit to Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone, Centers for Disease Prevention Director Dr. Tom Frieden said he saw ""real momentum and real progress"" in combating the virus. ""It's going to be a long hard fight, but I am hopeful that we are going to see continued progress. The challenge is not to let up, not to be complacent and to really double down,"" he said. Last week, the World Health Organization put the number of reported deaths from Ebola at 6,915, with more than 18,600 cases of the disease reported. Asked about the CDC's report in September that in certain scenarios, Ebola cases could reach 550,000 by January, Frieden said: ""The projections we released a few months ago showed what could happen if nothing more were done -- in fact an enormous amount has been done."" He said what had changed was the world's reaction response to not letting that happen. Liberia had the ""most hopeful picture"" of the three countries, Frieden said. ""As of today, it has the upper hand over the virus."" This was due to the country's implementation of the Rapid Isolation and Treatment for Ebola approach, he said. Extensive challenges remain, however, in Sierra Leone, he said. ""Sierra Leone has by far the largest number of cases of the three countries at this point and is in a rapid scale-up phase."" This is in part a result of the ""challenge of complacency,"" he said. As the number of cases fell, he said, health care workers were ""relaxing their grip"", by, for example, not wearing protective clothing or ignoring the possibility of Ebola infection when treating patients for other ailments. Three actions were important to combat the next phase of the outbreak, Frieden said: . First, break the cycle of exponential growth. Second, trace every chain of transmission and ensure the intensive followup of every patient with Ebola. And third, strengthen the areas that were now Ebola-free to prevent outbreaks there, he said. ""The next phase is in many ways harder -- it's tracing every single case to break every single chain of transmission including in highly mobile urban areas and that's going to be challenging,"" he said. ""The problem is there are clusters all over and new ones popping up all the time. Till each of the three countries get to the last cluster, the last case, then we're at risk."" A lot had been done to combat Ebola, Frieden said, but it was still a ""work in progress,"" with -- for example -- more French-speaking health care workers needed in Guinea to stop the spread there. Tools on the horizon included a new point-of-care diagnostic kit that would allow health care workers to diagnose the virus on the spot -- rather than having to make sometimes arduous trips back from remote areas for lab testing of suspected cases. Frieden said that another new initiative in Sierra Leone would allow the vaccination of thousands of health care workers -- if and when a safe vaccine was developed. But he said with new tools -- especially the vaccine -- ""we have to ardently hope that they work urgently, but we can't count on them working.""","CDC Director Dr. Tom Frieden has just returned from West Africa .

"(CNN)It's widely considered the only place in which seeds planted during the ""Arab Spring"" may have grown into the first sprouts of democracy.  And now, Tunisia officially has a new president-elect. Long-time politician Beji Caid Essebsi won the country's runoff with about 55% of the vote, beating outgoing President Moncef Marzouki's 44%, state-run media reported Monday. It was a hard-fought race. On Sunday, despite earlier indications Essebsi had won, supporters of Marzouki rallied in downtown Tunis. Security forces responded to rock-throwing rioters by firing tear gas to quickly disperse the crowds, state-run media reported. As a candidate, Essebsi promised to restore the state's prestige after the chaotic years since the 2011 revolution, when the country's dictator, President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali, was ousted. But Marzouki warned that Essebsi would bring back authoritarian policies. Inside Ben Ali's palace: Fake diplomas, sports cars, stuffed leopard . The fact that the elections -- considered legitimate -- took place at all is historic. The election process began in October with a vote for parliament. ""At a time when hopes of moving towards political reform and accountable governments elsewhere in the Arab world have been dashed, Tunisia is the only country where the aspirations of the Arab uprisings may yet be fulfilled in the near future,"" Anthony Dworkin of the European Council on Foreign Relations wrote at the time. On Saturday, The Economist declared Tunisia its ""country of the year."" ""The idealism engendered by the Arab spring has mostly sunk in bloodshed and extremism, with a shining exception: Tunisia,"" the magazine wrote.  ""...

"(CNN) -- President Barack Obama will convene a summit Monday at the White House of the heads of every key African nation -- except three: Ebola-plagued Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone. And as of now, the African Ebola epidemic, the largest on record, is not officially on the summit agenda. As their epidemics spin out of control in a contagion more than three times larger than any prior Ebola outbreak, Presidents Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf of Liberia, Alpha CondÃ© of Guinea and Ernest Bai Koroma of Sierra Leone are staying home. They are taking drastic measures in hopes of slowing the spread of the deadly hemorrhagic disease: Banning public gatherings, closing schools, deploying their armies to stop attacks on health workers and maintain quarantines. It is tragic that Sirleaf, CondÃ© and Koroma will not be able to plead their nations' cases at the White House summit because their countries desperately need help. There is great danger that the fear of the virus spreading globally will stigmatize Liberians, Sierra Leonians and Guineans, and that their West African neighbors -- especially Nigeria -- will try to ward off Ebola by isolating the countries in ways that will hurt their fragile economies, further imperiling the health of their people. It is time to take a cold, clear look at the implications of this out-of-control epidemic and think carefully about what steps the international community should take next. The outbreak began in Guinea in March and has spread slowly, inexorably in the three desperately poor countries for months. It reached dangerous epidemic scale in June, but only as July draws to its end has it registered with urgency with international media and political leaders. Why now? Because two Americans volunteers are fighting for their lives in the region, and a third American succumbed to Ebola in Lagos, Nigeria, having acquired his infection in Liberia. The specter of Ebola spreading via air travel to Nigeria, the most populous African nation, prompted the UK government to issue a national medical alert this week. The fear also threatens the creation of a vast cordon sanitaire -- or barrier -- around the three afflicted countries. Short-term focus on Ebola control cannot be disconnected from a longer term commitment to economic and technical support of these nations' health care systems, roads, schools and general development. These countries face Ebola today, but they also contend with Lassa fever virus, which also causes hemorrhagic disease. There also are mosquitoes carrying yellow fever and malaria, and a long list of microbial dangers are always lurking in their rainforests. To show how ill-equipped these nations are to battle disease, per capita spending on health care, combining personal and governmental, amounts to only $171 a year in Sierra Leone, $88 a year in Liberia and $67 a year in Guinea, according to the Kaiser Foundation. There is also a dire shortage of health care workers. Before the Ebola epidemic claimed the lives of several of the nations' leading physicians and nurses, Liberia had 0.014 physicians per 1,000 people; Sierra Leone's doctor-to-patient ratio was 0.022 and Guinea's was 0.1. To put that in perspective, rich countries have a thousand times more physicians per capita. In the United States, there are 2.5 doctors per 1,000 people. When this Ebola epidemic eventually ends, the health budgets of these nations will have been bankrupted, and many of their most skilled and courageous physicians, nurses, Red Cross volunteers and hospital workers will have perished. Nigeria is the tipping point. Were Ebola to take hold in that country, spreading from person-to-person in a densely populated, chaotic city such as Lagos, the worldwide response would swiftly spin into uncharted political and global health territory. Consider the following: Nigerian physicians are on strike nationwide; hundreds of girls have been kidnapped from their schools and villages over the past six months by Boko Haram Islamist militants -- and none has been successfully freed from their captors by the Abuja government. Nigeria is in the midst of national election campaigning. President Goodluck Jonathan's government is, at best, weak. The nation is torn apart by religious tension, pitting the Muslim north against the Christian south. Islamists in the north have long distrusted Western medicine. They have opposed polio vaccination and have kidnapped and assaulted central government health providers. Nigeria, the most populous nation in Africa, has just surpassed South Africa as its richest. It has a large, elite class that is highly mobile. Its international airports buzz with activity as hundreds of thousands of Nigerians travel all over Africa, take college studies in Europe and North America, visit second homes in London, New York, Toronto and other cities, and conduct business on the international stage. Sierra Leone, Guinea and Liberia are three of the poorest, most remote nations on Earth while Nigeria is Africa's muscle, hustle and oil. One way or another, Obama must take advantage of Monday's Africa summit to press the case for calm and appropriate responses. These would include specific post-Ebola financial commitments to Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea. The possibility that the epidemic might take hold in Nigeria must be confronted, and plans of action must be considered. The world cannot afford to make decisions in the heat of panic about such things as international airport closures, withdrawal of foreign oil workers, negotiations for outbreak responses with northern imams, hospital and clinic infection control training across thousands of Nigerian health facilities, deployment of international assistance teams for rapid diagnostics and lab assistance and countless other contingencies. Roughly 70% of diagnosed Ebola patients in this epidemic have perished. The potential for global panic is genuine. If responsible leaders worldwide hope to stave off hysterical reactions to the virus and bring this epidemic to a halt, serious contingencies and agreements must be reached immediately. Please, President Obama, do not squander the opportunity to place such contingency planning on your Monday summit agenda. As NPR talk show host Diane Rehm asked me on her show, ""Can't the White House put Presidents Sirleaf and Koroma on Skype, to plead their case to the summit?"" That would be a start.","President Obama's Africa summit does not have Ebola epidemic on agenda .

"(CNN) -- ""One of the unfortunate realities of policing,"" New York police Commissioner William Bratton said after the killings of Officers Rafael Ramos and Wenjian Liu, ""is that you put that blue uniform on and you become part of the thin blue line between us and anarchy."" This ""Thin Blue Line"" concept, which first appeared in a 1966 police documentary, reflects the conservative worldview of police culture. Most citizens can be forgiven for going through their day without thinking of anarchy or barbarians storming the gates. But many police, especially in New York City, see themselves as a thin blue line besieged by both a liberal and criminal world, neither of which they particularly like or understand. Large protests, especially when they're anti-police, solidify this belief because police see firsthand just how thin their blue line actually is. Police know they are outnumbered and sometimes outgunned, even while presenting a front of dominance and control. At any given moment, in this city of 8.4 million people, there are close to 6,000 police officers on duty. Certainly there are more than 6,000 violent criminals. Last year there were 86,000 felony arrests in New York. Were these felons able to rise up en masse, it's not just the police who would be overwhelmed. When I was a police officer in Baltimore, I would drive around and put out one brush fire after another. It would have been easy to be overwhelmed by the lives broken by repeated bad choices, by the mentally ill, the children who grow up without hope, another murder victim, the literal stink of society's least wanted and the sheer magnitude of human idiocy. As to police danger, it shouldn't be overstated (police officers are paranoid enough as is), but the danger isn't just in the small though real risk of being attacked and killed. What screws with your head is the constant occupational demand of hyper alertness -- of having to engage with and confront danger, and always on danger's terms. When I cleared a drug corner, sometimes I couldn't help but wonder why the dealers didn't just jump me. Effective compliance is as much earned as ordered, but I don't think they obeyed me because they liked me (at least I hope not). Bluster aside, my job and safety depended on respect and deference to my authority. That said, some of the thin blue line rhetoric is less about public and personal safety than political ideology (and contract negotiations). Of course, many police hate Mayor Bill de Blasio (just as they hate President Barack Obama). Police tend to be conservative. The last time New York had both a liberal mayor and contract negotiations, police actually rioted. Drunken officers rushed the steps of City Hall, damaged cars and slandered Mayor David Dinkins with racial epithets. Reporters were attacked. Police even took over the Brooklyn Bridge. Ideology aside, there's no evidence that Democrats are worse for police. Despite the horrible assassinations of Liu and Ramos, we have not seen any sustained increase in violence directed toward New York City police officers. Nationwide and in New York, line-of-duty deaths have been on the decline since 1970 through Republican and Democratic administrations. Indeed, they've fallen during the Obama years. In a democratic society, we demand a lot from our police, as we should. We owe police and each other respect and lawful compliance. In return, and without being subservient on the job, police must remain public servants. Police need to show greater empathy and tolerance for disagreeing and even disagreeable citizens, including elected officials. But when the mayor, the President or the attorney general are seen -- incorrectly in my opinion -- as being ""anti-police,"" this is viewed as more than a personal slight to police. Refusing a lawful order, resisting arrest or taking the side of a criminal in a fight with police is not just a ""reasonable people can disagree"" situation. An attack on the thin blue line is perceived as an existential threat to working policemen and women. Blame politicians for idiotic laws; blame society for racial injustice; blame the war on drugs for mass incarceration; blame a violent gun culture; blame poverty. We can improve society without blaming police officers. And we also need to move beyond the thin blue line. We can do better.","Peter Moskos: Many police see themselves as a ""Thin Blue Line"" besieged by criminals, liberals .

"(CNN) -- Ever since ""Bridge-gate"" threatened to derail the once ""inevitable"" nomination of New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie as the Republican presidential candidate for 2016, Jeb Bush has been hinting that he might jump into the fray. And with last week's Facebook announcement, the former Florida governor has emerged as a serious contender -- if he chooses to run. The announcement of an exploratory committee has generated instant excitement because many Republicans feel that the former governor stands a very real chance of winning both the Republican nomination and the general election. Though the pundits have pored over all of his liabilities, most importantly the damage that his older brother inflicted on the family name, Jeb Bush brings a lot to the table for 2016. If he handles this process the right way, Bush has the opportunity to put together a strong campaign. Democrats and his Republican opponents should be worried. The most important asset Jeb Bush offers is that he is a known commodity, someone who is greatly respected in Republican circles. In this day and age of freewheeling primaries, the comfort level that experience and familiarity provides to potential donors and voters means a lot. Republicans are desperate to win back the White House after eight years of Democratic rule. Their recent success in the midterms whet their appetite for gaining control over the government. Republicans know that the electoral math will be extremely difficult for them in 2016 as more voters, particularly among Democrats, are likely to come to the polls and the electoral college map favors blue. Republicans have watched many of their candidates crash and burn in recent primaries, so they are eager to find someone who make it through to the finish line for the nomination and present a strong case in the general election. Bush can survive the pressure from the right in the primaries. All the speculation as to whether someone like him will be done in by the Tea Party in primaries is vastly overblown. Most importantly, other than on immigration reform and education policy, Bush is a conservative and has a record to prove it. As Frank Bruni of The New York Times recounted, moderate is not really a label that fits his record. He has a rather conservative record on tax cuts and gun rights, one that would be quite appealing to the right. He is a staunch opponent of abortion rights and same-sex marriage. Much ""of his record in Florida is that of the 'headbanging conservative' he claimed to be during a first, unsuccessful campaign for governor in 1994,"" Bruni writes. He attacked affirmative action and gained national prominence when he fought against Michael Schiavo who wanted to remove the feeding tube of his wife Terri Schiavo. With Cuba, he stuck to the traditional hardline position in response to President Obama's recent announcements on normalizing relations. Bush will be able to make a strong case in the primaries that he is as conservative as anyone else in the bunch. And even if there are still questions about his conservative credentials in the age of the Tea Party, the power of the right in the Republican primaries has not really proven to be debilitating to candidates who are trying to build a broad coalition. In 2008 Republicans picked Arizona Sen. John McCain who famously had been in conflict with the right wing of his party. Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney, despite all the predictions that he would never survive, did just fine on his way to the 2012 nomination. These candidates were able to make enough statements to please conservatives without radically transforming who they were. This year will be no different. Most Republican activists are thirsty for a candidate who can win rather than one who would be 100% pure on ideological issues. Then there is the power of money. During the recent midterm primaries, the Republican establishment showed that money matters. In 2014, tea party candidates fared very poorly when confronted with Republicans who had the backing of big money conservatives eager to support candidates who could win and avoid those whose devastating sound bites would energize Democrats. The same dynamic that was on display in the midterms will be true in the presidential primaries. Bush is likely to draw considerable support from key players in the Republican fund-raising machine. As soon as he made his announcement, Politico reported, a group of prominent Republican donors expressed their excitement. ""He's got proven executive experience,"" said GOP bundler Fred Malek, the finance chairman of the Republican Governors Association that Chris Christie currently heads. ""He's a uniter. He's got smarts. He's got political courage."" Bush will also be able to tap into many endorsements from prominent Republicans who have been champing at the bit to have him run. While Bush is a conservative, without question, his record on the issues of immigration and education along with his demeanor will probably be enough to make a pitch that he is a coalition builder . Politics: Jeb Bush will defend expanded immigration . While his conservative record will be sufficient to counteract Tea Party frustration, Bush will be able to sell himself as part of a Republican cohort that is seeking to bring new people into the Republican fold and who is sensitive to the ways in which social and cultural issues have changed where the party stands on these issues. His record on immigration, as well education (he supports Common Core, the program that is controversial with many, including conservatives), combined with his immediate family will make it much tougher for Democrats to paint him as far right of center, the strategy that has worked so well for them in recent years. It is less clear how well he will be able to deal with some of the economic concerns facing the American electorate. Like most Republicans, he will face Democrats pointing to the evidence of economic recovery under President Obama, and he has close tied to the business, anti-tax establishment faction of the GOP that hurt Mitt Romney in 2012. The housing market started to crash in Florida toward the end of his term, though it didn't really take effect until after he got out. At the same time, he still will be able to tap into some of the anxiety of the middle class about the stability of this recovery, surely claiming credit for the current state of the Florida economy. Finally there is the question of Bush fatigue. The biggest obstacle that Jeb Bush faces is his last name. The controversial ending of George W. Bush's presidency and his terrible popularity ratings were a shadow that loomed over another Bush candidacy. But, especially in the short-attention span politics of the U.S., 2008 is a long time ago. The intense controversy over President Obama has redirected much of the political heat toward the Democratic leader, while the traditional waves of nostalgia about the last president have started to set in. Continued problems with foreign policy and the economy, as well as the extension of much of the homeland security program under President Obama, has undercut some of the claims that Bush was wholly to blame for the problems that bothered Americans. The success of the Tea Party at shifting the GOP further to the right allows Bush's supporters to claim that the previous Republican president was not as extreme as his critics said. Jeb Bush is a good campaigner and he shouldn't be taken lightly. If he puts his full heart into this race, and it still remains unclear thus far that he will, Hillary Clinton and other Republican contenders should be worried that the 2016 election could be another year for the Bush family. Note: An earlier version of this article incorrectly described former President George W. Bush; he is Jeb Bush's older brother.","Julian Zelizer: Jeb Bush may be Republicans' strongest candidate for 2016 .

"2:20 p.m. update: Rep. Michael Grimm pleaded guilty to one charge of tax evasion. Update: Rep. Michael Grimm, R-New York, is expected to sign a ""statement of facts"" admitting that he evaded taxes as alleged by the federal government in a 20-count indictment, although Grimm will only plead guilty to one count of tax evasion, law enforcement sources said. The sources added that prosecutors will push for Grimm to serve at least some federal prison time after his guilty plea. Grimm is set to be sworn in as a re-elected member of Congress in January, although his colleagues could choose to expel him from the body. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi said in a statement Wednesday that Grimm should resign. ""Now that the election is over, Congressman Grimm is finally admitting the truth to his constituents,"" she said. ""Clearly, Speaker Boehner must insist that Congressman Grimm resign immediately."" Original post: . New York Republican Congressman Michael Grimm will plead guilty to one count of tax evasion on Tuesday in a New York court, according to a U.S. law enforcement official. The charge can bring some prison time, but it's not clear whether Grimm will be sentenced with any. After being indicted in April on 20 counts of filing false tax returns, mail fraud, wire fraud, hiring undocumented workers and perjury, Grimm insisted he did nothing wrong and pled not guilty. His trial was scheduled to begin in February. But a U.S. law enforcement official tells CNN that Grimm will appear before a Brooklyn judge at 1 p.m. on Tuesday and admit he deliberately misled the Internal Revenue Service, a move that throws his congressional future into jeopardy. Federal prosecutors say Grimm failed to report $1 million from his restaurant business in Manhattan prior to his 2010 election to Congress. Democrats hoped the federal indictment against the House Republican last spring would mean Grimm's constituents would toss him out. But despite efforts by his Democratic opponent, Domenic Recchia, to paint him as corrupt, Grimm was easily re-elected in November for third term. Grimm attracted national attention last year even before his high-profile legal troubles when he threatened to throw a reporter over a Capitol Hill balcony at the end of an interview.  Grimm was captured on a hot mic after the President's State of the Union speech berating the reporter for pressing him on allegations of wrongdoing. He later apologized for his behavior. Grimm gave up his seat on the House Financial Services Committee after he was charged, but repeatedly insisted he would be ""fully exonerated."" The House Ethics Committee began an investigation into Grimm's activities last spring, but recently announced it was deferring action on the matter at the request of the Justice Department. With Grimm's new plea, the committee could decide early next year to renew its investigation and consider some type of punishment. There will also likely be pressure on Grimm to step down from Congress. Grimm's congressional office and his attorney did not immediately respond to CNN requests for comment.","New York Rep.

"An independent report released Monday into the execution of Arizona inmate Joseph Wood revealed the state's Department of Corrections followed protocol. ""This independent review concluded that at all times following the administration of the execution protocol, the inmate was fully sedated, was totally unresponsive to stimuli, and as a result did not suffer,"" said Corrections Director Charles Ryan. ""In fact, the Pima County medical examiner is cited as reporting that the breathing pattern exhibited by the inmate prior to his death is a normal bodily response to dying, even in someone highly sedated,"" Ryan said. The report timeline for the July 23 execution confirmed previous accounts that it took two hours for Woods to die after the first drug protocol was administered at 1:40 p.m. And after the first lethal injection failed to kill Wood, executioners gave him 14 additional doses of a two-drug cocktail. During those two hours, witnesses including Wood's attorney claimed to have seen Wood snorting and struggling to breathe. Troy Hayden, a media witness from KSAZ, likened Wood's breathing to a ""fish gulping for air."" The report timeline did not remark on Wood's breathing. After the staff administered a dose, they confirmed that Wood remained sedated. ""The medical examiner in this case offered no apparent explanation for the time lapse that occurred in the Wood execution,"" read the report.  ""The IV team leader, medical examiner and an independent correctional health expert agreed that the dosage administered was sufficient to cause death in a relatively short period of time. All agreed that the dosage of midazolam would result in heavy sedation."" The two-drug cocktail itself -- a mix of midazolam and hydromorphone -- came into question. Wood's attorney, Dale Baich, argued the report did not ""answer the question of why the experimental drug protocol did not work as promised."" In an open letter, Ryan told Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer he intends to stop using the midazolam and hydromorphone cocktail and instead use a one-drug injection or a three-drug cocktail. ""Based on this report, I forwarded my assessment to Governor Jan Brewer that the state continue efforts to procure drugs for the one-drug protocol, and begin the process to adopt three-drug protocols, as opposed to utilizing a modified two-drug protocol,"" Ryan said. Baich said he warned the Department of Corrections of the two-drug combination long before the execution. ""The pre-identified problems came true,"" Baich said. ""The decision to now remove this formula is an acknowledgment by the Arizona Department of Corrections that it was wrong in choosing this combination of chemicals."" The independent review came at Brewer's request. She directed the Department of Corrections to review the process citing concerns over the amount of time it took for Wood to die. A federal judge ordered local officials to preserve all physical evidence in Wood's execution. Wood was convicted of murder and assault in the 1989 deaths of his estranged girlfriend and her father. ""You don't know what excruciating is. What's excruciating is seeing your dad laying there in a pool of blood, seeing you sister laying there in a pool of blood.  This man deserved it.  And I shouldn't really call him a man,"" said Jeanne Brown, a relative of Wood's victims. Wood was the latest American death row inmate to argue that an anesthetic recently introduced in some states' execution protocols could fail to sufficiently knock out the inmate ahead of the lethal drugs, subjecting the person to an agonizing death. Wood claimed among other things that the state was going to use an ""experimental"" drug protocol. In documents filed with the state Supreme Court, Wood contended the use of the anesthetic midazolam was problematic in recent U.S. executions and that it would violate the Constitution's guarantee against cruel and unusual punishment. Some states turned to midazolam this decade after they could no longer get sodium thiopental, a drug that was regularly used for executions. A U.S. manufacturer stopped producing sodium thiopental in 2009, and countries that still produce it won't allow its export to the United States for use in lethal injections. Earlier this year, Oklahoma put executions on hold after the controversial execution of Clayton Lockett. Midazolam was part of the injection combination, and it took 43 minutes for him to die, Oklahoma officials said. The Arizona report remarked on the differences with the Oklahoma case. ""Staff performance in no way contributed to the extended time lapse from initiation of the drug protocol to pronouncement of death. As noted, the execution was not 'botched"" in comparison to what occurred in Oklahoma with Clayton Lockett,"" said the report. But Baich remains unconvinced. ""The state should release all of the documentation and witness reports that went into this review. Only through discovery in a court of law will there be a truly independent and comprehensive examination of what went wrong during Mr. Wood's nearly two-hour execution,"" he said.

"A Mexican judge has ordered the detention of 12 federal police officers accused of opening fire on a U.S. diplomatic vehicle south of the capital last week. Under the judge's order, the officers will be held for 30 days, Jose Luis Manjarrez, a spokesman for the Mexican Attorney-General's Office, said Monday. They will be transferred to Mexico City from the state of Morelos, where they are being held, he said. The 12 officers are under investigation in relation to five charges, including attempted murder, according to one of their lawyers, Marco Aurelio Gonzalez. Following the shooting incident Friday, two U.S. Embassy employees, described by a senior U.S. government official as U.S. citizens, were taken to a hospital with nonlife-threatening wounds. A member of the Mexican Navy who was with them in the vehicle suffered light bruises, according to a statement from the Mexican Navy. The statement provided the following account of events: . The incident unfolded at 8 a.m. Friday, as the two embassy employees and the Mexican were traveling to a military facility in the municipality of Xalatlaco in a Toyota Land Cruiser. Some 4 kilometers (2.5 miles) earlier, they had left the main highway that connects Mexico City with Cuernavaca, near the town of Tres Marias, a thinly populated area off the main road. When a vehicle containing Federal Police approached and its occupants brandished their weapons, the driver of the diplomatic vehicle tried to evade them and return to the main highway. At that point, the police sprayed bullets into the black SUV with diplomatic plates. Moments later, three other vehicles carrying Federal Police joined the attack, also shooting at the U.S. Embassy vehicle. By now, the Mexican Navy official who was in the embassy vehicle had contacted personnel at a nearby military installation, who arrived after the firing had ended and cordoned off the site, the Navy statement said. Both embassy employees were taken, under Federal Police guard, to a hospital. Photographs of the SUV showed the embassy vehicle pockmarked with more than a dozen holes and at least three of its tires flat. In addition to the attempted murder charge, the detained police officers are facing charges of abuse of authority, damage to property, bodily harm and abuse of public duty, according to Gonzalez. The lawyer said that the officers were investigating a kidnapping when they came across the embassy vehicle, which ignored their requests to stop. The Mexican Public Security Secretariat has acknowledged in a statement that the officers fired on the armored vehicle with diplomatic plates while they were looking for a group of suspected criminals. The U.S. Embassy in Mexico is cooperating with the investigation into the shooting incident, Victoria Nuland, the State Department spokeswoman, said Monday. ""I'm not going to get ahead of the investigation. I think we're going to wait and see what that concludes,"" she said when asked whether the incident was an attack or an ambush. The violent incident is the third in recent years involving U.S. officials in Mexico. In 2010, a U.S. consular employee, her husband and another man died in a gun attack in Ciudad Juarez. And in 2011, a U.S. immigration and customs agent was killed and another was wounded in an attack by an armed group on a highway in the state of San Luis Potosi. Violence related to drug gangs has increased in recent years in Morelos, the state where the shooting incident took place Friday.","A judge orders the police officers held for 30 days .

"New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo is calling for calm amid a back-and-forth of finger-pointing between activists, police leaders and elected officials following the execution-style murder of two New York City police officers this weekend. Cuomo called for a ""societal deep breath"" and a ""cooling off period"" this week in a radio interview Monday on New York's WNYC, calling the heated, inflammatory rhetoric that engulfed the city this weekend unproductive. ""Sometimes with high emotion you stop hearing and processing. And I think that's where we are now. It's not productive, it's potentially destructive,"" Cuomo said. ""People have strong feelings. I understand that, I respect that, but I ask people to join me to bring a period of calm this week."" Former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani tied the police murders to ""intense, anti-police hatred"" among leaders and activists reacting to the non-indictment of two white police officers who killed two unarmed black men in separate instances this summer. And the leader of the city's largest police union directly blamed New York Mayor Bill de Blasio for the murders, saying the officers' blood is ""on many hands,"" starting ""on the steps of City Hall in the office of the mayor."" When asked if de Blasio had the governor's full support, Cuomo said the mayor, union leaders and community activists have his ""full support."" Cuomo insisted several times he would not get dragged into the divisive business of assigning blame to anyone. ""I think that is the negative cycle that we are in. I don't want to point fingers, I don't want to cast blame,"" Cuomo said. ""I think Mayor de Blasio is doing the best he can under very difficult circumstances to hear all sides of the matter. You have polarization in this city and that's the fundamental issue. You have two different points of view that right now are seemingly irreconcilable."" Cuomo said he was interested in starting a dialogue on reforms to address both Eric Garner's killing by a police officer this summer and the murder of the two police officers this weekend, but only after a ""cooling off period."" Those reforms would build off of concerns he said he's heard that range from grand jury secrecy to survivors' benefits for police officers and whether police car windows should be bulletproof. Cuomo also said the grand jury decision in Garner's chokehold death at the hands of a police officers ""was seemingly wholly incongruous with what you saw in that video."" Garner's death was captured on camera, and Garner can be heard saying ""I can't breathe"" in the video. Cuomo added that ""there are legitimate points"" in Garner's case.","Cuomo called for leaders to calm the rhetoric after two NYPD officers were murdered this weekend .

"(CNN)What is beauty? What role does it have in spirituality? Is it in the eye of the beholder? These seemingly innocuous questions have snowballed into a bitter polemic on the Catholic altar, where a battle of aesthetic titans has ensued: religious scholars versus the so-called ""starchitects"" who have earned multimillion-dollar contracts to build megachurches for the new millennium. To arbitrate, Italian photographer Andrea Di Martino looked to find meaning in these newly built houses of God. ""I wanted to photograph new-but-already-established churches from this millennium ... but I had to explain to a lot of people that I wasn't documenting the demise of the Catholic Church or even the loss of churchgoers but how these churches have now become part of the establishment,"" he said. From Turin to Rome, Di Martino zigzagged through cities where celebrity architects hoped their designs would add to Italy's great architectural landscape. Photographing the works of architectural giants such as Paolo Portoghesi, Mario Botta, Richard Meier, Renzo Piano and others, Di Martino explored whether there is a historical continuum with the traditions of Brunelleschi, Bernini, Da Vinci and other artistic geniuses whose religious reverence helped build some of the world's greatest monuments. Di Martino used a formal approach, photographing these churches from an egalitarian perspective. His camera takes a centralized position to allow the architectural concepts to get fair play. Photography, he hoped, could translate the aesthetic decisions behind some very controversial and expensive designs that, to some people, are unrecognizable as churches. In Turin, which hosts the Holy Shroud, Di Martino photographed Botta's Church of Santo Volto. Standing in what was a depressed steelwork factory, the church has received endless accolades by design experts around the world. But it has also been criticized by Vatican members and religious scholars who say they are extremely materialistic, devoid of spiritual references and divorced from the Catholic dogma. At the other end of the discussion, these new architects are building a new vision for the future. Botta's work is often called ""revolutionary"" and ""genius,"" and some have put it in the company of Le Corbusier and Niemeyer. The crux of the issue: Is there a continuum with the past? Does it follow the Catholic Church's norms, defined by decree, for what is a church? In an online interview, Botta acknowledged the struggle. ""To build a church nowadays is to come face to face with millenary history and, whether I like it or not, I find myself (confronting) these historical issues,"" he said. Di Martino said that when he stood outside photographing these churches, he rarely got a positive response. ""I know you can't build Baroque churches today, but there is definitely a disconnect between the populace and the ideas of these architects,"" Di Martino said. ""The big issue is that we are in search of a model that can represent our era. And we haven't found one."" Vatican officials have lashed out against what they see as a diversion from dictates on how to build a church according to Catholic liturgy. These laws, however, have been subject to interpretation. Social media . Follow @CNNPhotos on Twitter to join the conversation about photography. The Diocese of Turin, for instance, defends its decision to stand by Botta's design, claiming it adheres to Catholic dogma on aesthetics. The seven-tower church with skylights is a symbolic play on the use of natural light in ritual and divinity. The industrial-looking church complex blends in with the area associated with Turin's working class. To the common eye, these towers may seem more like giant chimneys, a reference to the industrial, working-class area. Photographing inside this monumental building is a different story. Liturgical tradition is referenced, but only slightly. Di Martino photographs the pixelated image of the Holy Face, a ""half-cross"" by the altar, every element illuminated by natural light. A possible allusion that God is omnipresent in the digital age? In Rome, Meier was tasked to build a church in the city's somewhat derelict outskirts of Rome in an area called Tor Tre Teste. Perched like a white pearl amid tired tower blocks and parking lots, Meier's Jubilee Church is simple and reflects light like other Meier buildings. It is a clean, clear-cut design. But where is the recognizable iconography and other elements that help situate Catholics in this era of rationalist architecture? Di Martino, who said his style is really photojournalism, has great interest in social issues. Photographing modern buildings makes sense in his body of work, he said. ""I approach architecture in the same way. I am interested in how man is placed in this design, even though I photograph these buildings without people,"" he said. ""They are not there, but I still like to narrate their story."" Andrea Di Martino is an Italian photographer based in Milan. You can follow him on Facebook and Twitter.","Despite expensive price tags and celebrity architects, Italy's new churches have their critics .

"Tripoli, Libya (CNN) -- At first glance, ""Mahmoud"" would seem the perfect candidate to be a supporter of Moammar Gadhafi. He has prospered during the Libyan leader's 41-year reign, first as a professional and later taking care of his deceased father's businesses. But, as with many things in Tripoli, a first glance can be deceiving. ""Ninety percent of the people in Tripoli hate Gadhafi,"" Mahmoud told me over sips of espresso at a corner coffee shop this weekend. ""All his people do is tell lies. If anyone tells you different they are just afraid."" CNN is withholding his real name for his own safety. On an almost hourly basis, regime officials and government minders tell foreign journalists that Tripoli is a stronghold of Gadhafi and that dissent has vanished in recent months. CNN, like other media here, is under severe government restrictions. But I recently managed to slip away from government minders to talk directly to several Libyans. And according to several eyewitness accounts, major demonstrations were held against Libya's strongman as recently as last week. And in the Souq al-Juma neighborhood of the capital, where anti-Gadhafi protests first erupted in February, the government's propaganda bubble is quickly burst. While international journalists including me were ferried by government minders to a pro-Gadhafi rally at Green Square on Friday afternoon, multiple sources tell CNN that several Tripoli neighborhoods were wracked by running battles between protesters and security forces. ""They were protesting right around the corner. They streamed out of a mosque and onto the small square,"" said Mahmoud. ""Almost immediately Gadhafi forces fired at them with live rounds."" Mahmoud and other sources say that the group was several hundred strong. He claims that three people were killed and that the area was put under lockdown by government security. Other people in the area confirmed the death toll, but it is impossible for CNN to independently verify this account. The government has repeatedly denied any anti-Gadhafi protests in Tripoli in recent weeks, including on Friday. A taxi driver in his 20s also said that he took part in one of the protests in Souq al-Juma on Friday. CNN is calling him Jamal -- not his real name -- to protect his safety. ""We came out after afternoon prayers,"" he said, ""we were unarmed and peaceful and they just shot at us."" He says he a bullet grazed his arm. Jamal says that unlike the rebels in the East, they don't have easy access to weapons to fight. But he says, ""I am not afraid. Even though we were unarmed, I am doing this for the future of my country."" Another protest was fired upon in a seaside neighborhood of the capital, Jamal says, citing friends who said they were at the demonstration. Speaking to journalists in Tripoli is risky. Gadhafi's vast spying network means that almost anyone on the street could be an informer or worse. Residents of Souq al-Juma say that hundreds, if not thousands, have been summarily arrested by the dreaded intelligence ""brigades."" They are never heard from again. And it seems nowhere is safe. Jamal says that recently, a family he knows pinned up a rebel flag out of sight in their home. Somehow the intelligence services found out. ""They stormed into the house, pulled down the flag, and arrested every man in that house,"" says Jamal. But the worst indignity of all, people here say, is they can't bury their dead. ""The Gadhafi men. They come out and shoot you like cats,"" Mahmoud told me. ""they hold their guns over you like this and shoot you like cats. We are not people to them."" Regime officials will often then take the dead away, he says, not affording people a proper burial. ""If we bury them, we must do it in secret.""","CNN's David McKenzie gets away from Libya government minders to talk to ordinary people .

"(CNN) -- To Erdal Inci, GIFs are a form of visual music. ""When I started to look at the physics of music, I saw something that is unchanging. It's like you have a unique moment, and it repeats endlessly in the form of musical notes. I realized that I could do the same thing in video."" The Turkish digital artist has made a name for himself -- both online and in the gallery circuit -- for his surreal, looping works. In keeping with the demands of the art form, Inci's videos consist of short, one- to two-second clips looped in an endless run. Istanbul features prominently in the backdrop of his work, as does Inci himself. ""The city has really nice scenery and a beautiful light scene. I've decided to use this beautiful scenery as a decoration of some show. I've decided to use it as a set,"" he says. Inci seems to favor theater terms. Though his audience tends to view his work from their living rooms, he still sees what he does as a public performance, albeit it one in which he plays all the roles. He is the cast. Though there may be only one of him, he is able to use cloning tools to make more. He is also the crew; he is at once choreographer, director, editor and distributor. ""You can't put on a show in a public space without permission from the municipality. If you want a crowd scene, you need too many people. With this technique, I have a chance to show choreography to people in any possible place, like Taksim Square. And I just need one person. That's why I use myself -- it's the easiest way to do it. When you clone yourself, you can create an army that will move as you want. You don't need any production or special cameras,"" he says. His looping selfie army can be slightly comical, but it can also be eerie and haunting, which is precisely the effect he's going for. ""Sometimes people tell me they find my work spooky or scary. To hear that the work makes people feel something is the best comment for me,"" he says. Though his GIFs, once looped, contain a mere second or two of footage, it can take Inci as much as ten days to film and edit a single piece. To make sure he is alone with his city when filming, he usually sets up his camera on a fixed tripod between 3am and 5am. ""Some people are out that time of day,"" he concedes. ""Sometimes they won't see the camera, because it's far away, and they'll just see me streaming nonsense, or running on a spiral path, like a crazy man."" Inci says he finds comfort in the patterns he's able to create using just himself, a light source and the background. ""I create a human pattern. I can fill a space with those patterns. I have a chance to draw a line with people. The repetition makes me personally relaxed,"" he says.","Turkish artist Erdil Inci clones himself on GIFs to make surreal patterns .

"(CNN) -- The year 2012 was a historic one for Saudi Arabia. It was the first time two women from the country competed at an Olympic Games. A month earlier, ten Saudi women climbed to Mount Everest base camp, headed by Princess Reema Bandar to raise awareness of breast cancer and to promote physical activity. However the situation for sports women from the country was different at the recently completed Asian Games in South Korea. Western media and various international organizations including Human Rights Watch commented that not one of the 199 athletes from Saudi Arabia was a woman. Mohammed Al-Mishal, the Secretary General of Saudi Arabia's Olympic Committee said that Saudi Arabia was committed to sending female athletes to the next Olympics, but ""they were not yet competitive enough for the Asian Games."" ""Technically, we weren't ready to introduce any ladies and the new president of our Olympic committee (Prince Abdullah bin Musaed bin Abdulaziz) rejected sending women to only participate, as he wanted them to compete,"" said Al-Mishal. Jeddah United is a women's basketball team started in 2003. In 2006 it evolved into a sports company that trains both girls and boys in team sports with the aim of promoting sports in the Kingdom and developing potential Olympic talents. Since the company was established, an elite team for both girls and boys has been training hard for possible international competition and to lay the foundation for a potential girls national team. Over the years there have been many statements by high-ranking officials in the local media in Saudi Arabia that supported integrating girl sports in public schools, opening private clubs, allowing female participation in neighborhood centers, and setting the stage for more Olympic participation. However, logistical challenges remain, as there are no local sports professionals and no space is being made available in these public schools. In addition to that, very limited private facilities are available for similar activities, and there are no female members of Saudi Arabia's various sporting federations with the exception of Arwa Mutabagani in the Equestrian Federation. Finally, the absence of physical education departments in colleges and universities is another major hindrance to seeing more girls and women in sports. However, and in accordance with Prince Abdullah bin Musaid's vision, Jeddah United believes that, in international competitions, female athletes should be at a level to compete and not just participate symbolically. Saudi athletes need to train and be ready physically, mentally, and emotionally. Government and private sectors need to collaborate to make this a reality. Public funds need to be allocated, as the private sector alone will not be able to nurture sports women to a level so they can compete against others from countries that have supported women sports for decades. The good news is that the government can rely on existing teams, athletes and initiatives that have been running for years on their own that will be the foundation for women sports in Saudi Arabia.""

"Afghanistan cannot be expected to be a stable and contributing member of the international community when Afghan women are generally denied early and lifelong educational opportunities, are largely unable to work, and in some parts of the country suffer far worse. While this is a very easy claim to make, fundamentally improving the rights women have and creating the institutions to support those rights is much more difficult to implement given the current on-the-ground realities. Allowing an 8-year-old to marry, as often happens in Afghanistan, isn't driven by some bizarre desire to give away one's children. In the absence of viable choices, families tend to stay with the comfortable and the accepted -- no matter how horrific and foreign those decisions may seem to outsiders. Practices such as forced child marriage and limited women's rights are symptoms of a country clinging to old ideas in a vacuum of realistic alternatives. To believe a secure and prosperous Afghanistan can be left to the next generation while denying basic human rights to half the population is an exercise in mass delusion. It is equally delusional to believe this will change overnight, or even in this generation. But this change is possible. The question is how do we get there? If history is any guide, shifts in attitudes are unlikely to occur by decree from the Afghan National Assembly, and even less likely under pressure from the West. The driver of change will be food security for the majority of the country and innovative ideas that expand economic development within the realities of a largely cashless and agrarian society. According to the World Food Programme, Afghanistan consistently ranks in the bottom of the world in terms of food security and a 2012 study by the Afghan Research and Evaluation Unit highlighted the connection between food insecurity and lack of educational opportunities. Progress in this regard ultimately would allow more women to enter the workforce. An Afghan family dealing with uncertainty and poverty simply cannot make optimal choices about the future. Sometimes the choice is between finding illicit means of income or holding onto antiquated ideas and practices, which is what we see in Afghanistan now. This cycle has to be broken. Would the current opposition to women's rights be so fierce if Afghanistan were substantially richer or self-sustainable? Likely not, because it would be far less threatening to the established order. Taking crucial steps to expand the economy in creative ways is fundamentally a decision about human rights and regional security, not purely an economic decision in isolation. I have written previously about new ways to develop Afghanistan's rich natural resources in ways that are both transparent and benefit the majority of the country, not just those working in and around the mines. Returning Afghanistan to its status as Central Asia's ""bread basket"" through improved water management is another crucial step toward our own self-sufficiency. However, we must also understand that economic development in isolation without the direction of core beliefs will be squandered and the next generation will be struggling with the very same problems we have today. This change can only be accomplished with strong, values-based leadership in the Presidential Palace that is focused on the economic growth of the country as a whole and not just for a few friends and family members. We can then use that growth as the driver of positive change that can be sustained for decades. Afghanistan desperately needs economic innovations to reduce dependence on foreign partners and significant agricultural advances to reduce uncertainty for our families. A simple statement about rights without the economic capacity and social institutions to support them is doomed to failure but economic growth combined with core values on rights and education is how real change can happen. Then and only then can we have any hope of fighting the insurgency and securing a brighter future for all citizens, women and men alike.","Ahmad Massoud: Afghanistan's future is closely tied to the role of its women .

"When U.S. forces toppled the Taliban government following the 9/11 attacks, there was a global wave of support from people horrified by the plight of Afghan women. Under the Taliban, women had been denied education, banned from medical treatment by male doctors, and publicly executed for ""immorality."" The Taliban's fall promised women some basic freedoms and rights. Indeed, over the past 10 years there have been significant improvements for Afghan women and girls. Official restrictions ended on access to education, work, and health care. Millions of girls went to school for the first time. Women joined government, won elected office, and became police officers and even soldiers. A new constitution in 2004 guaranteed women equal rights, and a 2009 law made violence against women a crime. Underneath the surface of these changes, however, deep seated problems persist. Women in public life have suffered harassment, threats, and sometimes murder. Forced marriage, underage marriage, and domestic violence are widespread and too widely accepted. About 400 women and girls are imprisoned at present for the ""moral crimes"" of sex outside of marriage and simply running away from home, often to flee abuse. While education is more accessible, more than half of girls still don't go to school. Every two hours an Afghan woman dies of pregnancy-related causes. As the announced departure of international forces in 2014 draws closer, many Afghan women look to the future with fear.  They worry that the troop pullout signals the end of interest in Afghanistan, and with it the international commitment to push the Afghan government to promote and protect women's rights. Also likely to decrease is the foreign aid that pays for schools and clinics that have changed many lives. Afghan women fear being abandoned again by the rest of the world, as they were during the Taliban era. Plans for peace negotiations between the Taliban and the Afghan government raise the specter of women's rights being bargained away. If there are no women at the negotiating table, this is even more likely. This week the fragility of women's rights in Afghanistan has been on full display. The Ulema Council, a government-supported body of religious leaders, issued a statement on several issues, including the recent burning of copies of the Quran at a U.S. military base. The longest part of the statement, however, gave religious guidance on how women should be treated and should behave. The statement said some good things. It prohibited a traditional practice of giving a girl to another family to resolve a dispute (""baad""). It spoke against forced marriage. It confirmed women's rights to inherit and own property. On women's duties, however, the statement took a turn for the worse:  Women should not travel without a male chaperone. Women should not mix with men while studying, or working, or in public. Women must wear the Islamic hijab. Women are secondary to men. If this was just the view of conservative religious leaders, it would be discouraging, but just another in a long line of discriminatory statements about women from Afghanistan's male dominated institutions. What caused consternation, however, was the sense that President Hamid Karzai had embraced the statement. In a departure from usual practice, the statement was posted on the Presidential Palace website, distributed to the media by the Palace, and defended by President Karzai at a news conference. President Karzai has a mixed record on women's rights. He committed Afghanistan to an international convention promising equal rights for women and pushed through by decree the 2009 law making violence against women a crime. He recently spoke out on two high-profile cases of violence against women. On the other hand, in the run-up to the 2009 presidential election he curried favor with hard-liners by signing the Shia Personal Status Law, which, for Afghanistan's Shia minority, gives a husband the right to withdraw maintenance from his wife, including food, if she refuses to obey sexual demands, grants guardianship of children exclusively to men, and requires women to have permission from their husbands to work. Some women fear that Karzai is using the Ulema Council statement to send a message about what compromises he is ready to make with the Taliban. With international interest in Afghanistan waning, negotiations with the Taliban in the offing, and Karzai's endorsement of the Ulema Council's statement, Afghan women are more vulnerable than at any time in the past 10 years. Now President Obama and other backers of the Afghan government should make it clear that they will not support any deals that sacrifice women's rights, and press Karzai to make his position clear. The risks for Afghan women are too high to do anything less.","Afghan women's rights have improved in the last 10 years but problems persist .

"(CNN)He can usually be found on the red carpet on Oscars night, but this year Russell Crowe opted to take in a rugby league game instead. While the stars of showbiz were in Los Angeles Sunday for the biggest night in the film calendar, Crowe a few hours earlier was in Merseyside, England to see his South Sydney Rabbitohs side defeat St Helens to claim the World Club Series title. Crowe, who picked up the Best Actor gong in 2000 for his role in Gladiator, co-owns the Australian side, who took the game at Langtree Park by a record World Club Challenge-winning margin score of 39-0. Crowe has supported the Rabbitohs since he was a boy and took over the club in 2006 after purchasing a majority stake for a reported £1.5 million ($2.3m). The 50-year-old has helped oversee a remarkable turnaround in the side's fortunes in that time, taking it from a club that was once on the brink of insolvency to the very top of the sport. A first National Rugby League title in 43 years for the previous-perennial struggler in October was followed by its coronation Sunday as the best team on the planet. Glenn Stewart, Dylan Walker, Greg Inglis, Joel Reddy, Luke Keary and Chris McQueen all touched down for tries for Crowe's team at Langtree Park, while Adam Reynolds was on hand to provide a drop goal to ensure the points record -- the previous winning margin had been 38 points. English side St Helens is the only team to have failed to register a point in the World Club Challenge or the World Club Series, having also gone down 38-0 in 2003 to Sydney Roosters. The World Club Series is an annual rugby league competition played between the champion clubs of the Australasian National Rugby League and the European Super League. Previously known as the World Club Challenge, this year's edition was expanded to include a further four teams.","Russell Crowe saw his South Sydney Rabbitohs side win the World Club Series .

"Pope Francis moved a predecessor closer to sainthood on Sunday, beatifying Pope Paul VI on the last day of a gathering in Rome of church leaders from around the world. It was a ceremonious close to this year's Synod of the Bishops on the Family, which has ended in clinches over how to minister to gay and lesbian people or whether to give Holy Communion to Catholics who have divorced and remarried -- which the Catholic Church considers adultery. Paul VI, who was pontiff from 1963 until his death in 1978, had faced similar pressures during the advent of free love, when the church came out against birth control. Pope Paul VI based the decision on Catholic teachings on marriage. But the church is honoring other aspects of his work, highlighting his efforts to spread social justice and minister to the poor, topics Pope Francis also carries on his banner. Paul VI is also known for having pioneered papal world visits, traveling to Africa, Latin America and Asia. He was the first pope to visit five continents, the Vatican has said. He was also the first pope to visit the Holy Land since St. Peter, the Catholic News Service said. A trip to the Philippines in 1970 could have cost him his life, but it also provided one of the two necessary precursors for his beatification -- a relic. When he was attacked by a man with a bayonet in Manila, two vests he was wearing were stained with blood, according to historian John-Peter Pham. One of the vests was brought to the beatification in a reliquary. The second precursor required for beatification is a miracle. Pope Paul VI's involves an unborn child  in California, Vatican Radio said. A doctor advised a pregnant woman to abort her child because of danger to her life and his, but she refused and instead had a nun pray for her using a photo of Pope Paul, CNS reported. The child was born healthy. The announcement of the beatification came in May, two weeks after Pope Francis canonized two other  predecessors, John XXIII and John Paul II, allowing them to ascend to sainthood. The unprecedented ceremony was witnessed by huge crowds gathered in St. Peter's Square in Vatican City.","A relic and a miracle are required for Pope Paul VI to be beatified .

"It is sheer panic in the woman's voice on the cell phone video as the flames shot out of the windows of the wood frame home: ""There's a man in there!"" The next sound on the video is a loud explosion, likely the propane tank of a barbeque grill. ""We gotta get the dad,"" screams the woman. The explosion forced two men who were trying to reach the trapped man away from the home. Seconds later, a man in a blue Los Angeles Dodgers cap jogs out with a 73-year-old man slung over his shoulder. ""Oh thank God!"" says the woman who is recording the video, her relief as striking as her fear just seconds earlier. The elderly man is stunned as the man in the blue cap lowers him. He's wearing tubes that appear to help him breathe. We later learn he was attached to an oxygen tank, highly explosive in a house fire. On the video, you can see other people on the street run up to assist him. What you don't see is the moment the man in the blue cap disappears, vanishing before firefighters arrive or anyone gets his name. ""I didn't see him,"" says Beth Lederach, the woman who recorded the dramatic weekend fire and rescue on her cell phone. ""He went on his way, just disappeared."" Lederach, as she reviewed her video, saw something even more extraordinary. In the seconds before the explosion of the propane tank, you can see the man in the blue cap calmly walk towards the burning home, flames nearing 20 feet high. The explosion that forced others away from the house didn't stop the man in the blue cap. ""He calmly walks in there, calmly. Then here he comes, carrying the dad,"" recalls Lederach. Then he vanished. For 48 hours, the Fresno fire department and local reporters hunted for the mysterious hero, flashing his image all over area  news outlets. Who was he? Why would he dive into a burning home, save a man and then not stay long enough for even a simple ""thank you""? ""There's over half a million people in Fresno and this guy's picture is all over the news and nobody could find him,"" says Fresno fire department spokesman Koby Johns. While the fire department urges people to not dive into the middle of a fire for their own safety, Johns can't help but be impressed by seeing ordinary people at their best. ""For a civilian to do that, it's truly remarkable. There are some people, wired in such a way that when that moment presents itself, they don't think about self-preservation. They think about help. That's what makes them heroes."" Several men appeared to help the elderly man, all of whom came forward in the first 24 hours. But the mystery lingered... who was the man in the blue Dodgers cap? Perhaps the man who wanted to know most was Robert Wells, the 73-year-old man who was carried to safety on the man's back. ""He snatched me up and away we went. Bouncing on his back, hands like this, wow. That was one helluva ride."" I met Wells at the Red Roof Inn, the day before he and his were going to have to leave. Out of money and distraught about where to go, Wells, his daughter and granddaughter said the fire destroyed everything they owned. Wells has only about 25% lung capacity, as the result of COPD and emphysema. They are clearly struggling. But Wells was quick to point out he didn't lose his life, thanks to a heroic act of a man he'd never met. What he hoped for most was to say thank you to the mystery man. ""He's gonna be on my mind the rest of my life,"" says Wells. It appeared the man would never be found, that this might become Fresno folklore. But in this age, social media has a way of making sure all secrets are uncovered. It's a little unclear exactly how it happened, but a Facebook post from a relative of the man in the blue cap mentioned he knew the hero. Local reporters pounced. Tom Artiaga groaned as the reporters starting banging on his door. ""I didn't want the glory,"" he says sheepishly, wearing the same blue Dodgers cap he had on as he walked calmly towards Wells' burning home. ""I don't want it."" Artiaga can barely look at me as I prod him, so uncomfortable is he talking about himself. Artiaga says he was driving by when he saw the fire and heard the screaming about the trapped man inside. He parked his white truck and walked slowly towards the fire. The 49-year-old devoted husband, father of three and grandfather of five didn't think about what he had to lose. A man who spends his free time helping out elderly people in his neighborhood with their gardens naturally thought about what he could do to help. ""That's when the explosion went,"" he says. ""I just ducked, and seen the old man in the yard. He was on that machine. He couldn't walk."" Artiaga, whose stocky and muscular frame still reflects his younger years as an athlete, knew he could easily carry the elderly man out. ""I put him on my shoulder. Picked him up. Let's go."" As Artiaga lowered Wells from his shoulder, he saw Beth Lederach recording the rescue on her cell phone. In the same way his instinct was to walk towards Wells, Artiaga decided to walk away. Artiaga saw his picture in the paper and the video on the local news. He couldn't escape the video that was flying across Facebook and Twitter. He hoped his wife wouldn't find out because he didn't tell her. He hoped the story would fade and he could go back to his job as a delivery man for a liquor company, without anyone connecting the video to him. ""Why,"" I ask. ""Most of us liked to be thanked."" Artiaga's eyes begin to fill with emotion. ""We have to help each other out. We kill each other. We fight. We gotta help each other out. I don't feel like a hero. If it was someone else, I'd help them, too.""","Stunning video captures dramatic rescue from burning home .

"Choosing a safari can be a safari in itself. Often it's a stealthy operation that involves extensive prep work, a great deal of roaming and, occasionally, disappointment. To make it easier, we've examined the honors in the 2015 Safari Awards -- the Oscars of the safari industry -- and gathered 10 of our favorite finalists. These are the adventures that excel in location, animal encounters, social and environmental responsibility and offer something different. More than 4,000 travel agents, writers and operators were invited to nominate the best safaris across 20 categories. Here's our best of the best: . Norman Carr Walking Safari (Zambia) Encounters with animals don't get closer than when they're done on foot.

African Horseback Safaris (Botswana) Exploring the 450,000 acres of untouched nature in the Okavango Delta on horseback is a great way to spare both feet and the environment. Two decades in, African Horseback Safaris has bagged awards for its exhilarating rides beside big game stars such as elephant, zebra and giraffe. Relying on hooves instead of wheels, its equine adventures are largely unaffected by the annual flooding that makes many parts of the delta inaccessible to vehicles. The finely tuned horses drop their heads to graze and to signal other animals in the area to relax while riders get an eyeful. At the camp, each en suite safari tent boasts an elevated deck for a view of the floodplains. African Horseback Safaris, Macatoo Camp, Botswana; +267 686 1523; from $695 per person, per night . Tongole Wilderness Lodge (Malawi) When it comes to pocketing our travel dollars, it's good to know safari hosts have an eye on the local community, too.

Private guided safari vehicle can be booked for $475 (per day) Pumba Private Game Reserve & Spa (South Africa) Hippo, hyena, wildebeest, kudu, eland and antelope are among the attractions at the family-friendly Pumba Private Game Reserve & Spa. The big draw, however, is the majestic and endangered white lion. Pumba, a malaria-free haven dedicated to conservation and boosting the local community, operates a white lion-breeding program and is one of just two homes to the beast in the whole of southern Africa. Accommodation includes the Water Lodge, overlooking Lake Cariega, or Msenge Bush Lodge, looking out over a waterhole and mountain views.

"We awoke one morning in Kabul to the sound of not-too-distant explosions, marking the start to the fighting season. But bombs were not the foremost takeaway from our Mother's Day trip to Afghanistan -- the women fighting to stop the bombs left a more lasting impression. More than a decade after American and allied forces toppled the Taliban regime, the improvement in the quality of life for Afghan women is unmistakable. Women are now participants -- and in many cases, leaders -- in a society that once systematically subjugated them. There are female government officials at almost every level, young girls going to school, young women in college, and new opportunities cropping up around the country. On a sixth annual trip, our congressional delegation of women legislators spent several days in Afghanistan in May meeting with many of the women who have helped begin to reverse centuries of repression. We spoke with female public officials, women journalists, and heads of organizations focused on advancing the role of women. And we had the privilege to spend time with a special group of people who, although they are not from Afghanistan, have a unique appreciation for what Afghan women are fighting for. On Mother's Day we met our ""military moms"" -- women soldiers from the United States who have children back home. We delivered Mother's Day cards made by American school children, hosted a luncheon and listened to their stories of heroism and sacrifice. It became clear that all these women -- Afghan, American or otherwise -- are determined to preserve and grow the progress made by Afghan women and girls. The most striking example came when we met with women members of the Afghan parliament. At a roundtable, we discussed the opportunities that have been made available to Afghan women and girls over the past decade; the important role they must play in the country's society, security and economy in order to see future success; and the critical need to protect these gains from backsliding. ""We can bring democracy to Afghanistan,"" one of the Parliamentarians said. For emphasis, another added: ""We can deliver."" By engaging with the Afghan people directly, we experienced firsthand the growing sense of cautious optimism that seems to have taken root here, due in large part to women's gains and to the recent national elections. There is no mistaking that the situation in Afghanistan is still fragile and highly complicated. Yes, the elections in April saw relative success with high voter turnout, a higher than expected turnout among women, and relatively small amounts of violence. But runoff elections set for June 14 are another important test of the coalition-trained Afghan security forces and voter retention. A bilateral security agreement needs to be signed. Both remaining presidential candidates have signaled their willingness to participate in such an agreement, but details are yet to be finalized. A clear plan to maintain Afghan women's gains must be included. Our delegation urged for more focus to be placed on recruiting women to the Afghan National Security Forces. The Afghan Ministry of Defense currently has 700 women in the security forces, but that number needs to be increased significantly. Last week, President Barack Obama announced that 9,800 American troops will remain in Afghanistan after the end of 2014, with that number stepping down in subsequent years. No one wants our troops to stay in Afghanistan one moment longer than necessary, and the transition from a combat role to one of training and advisory must be done carefully and responsibly. Afghanistan must take the reins of their country's future, and America must play an important role in ensuring a lasting peace. A secure Afghanistan ultimately impacts America's national security. And strong signals of U.S. support contribute to the confidence of the Afghan people. An important bellwether for the success or failure of America's efforts in Afghanistan will be the preservation of the gains made by Afghan women. If the bombs we heard that morning in Kabul reminded us of the challenges that remain here, the women we met in Afghanistan personified how far this country has come, and the potential for where it goes next.

"MEXICO CITY, Mexico (CNN) -- The Mexican military has detained a suspected leader of a notorious drug-trafficking family in connection with the July slayings of two U.S. citizens. Benjamin LeBaron is buried in Galeana, Mexico, in July. Jose Rodolfo Escajeda, known as El Rikin, was taken into custody Friday in Nuevo Casa Grandes, in Chihuahua state, according to a military statement. Escajeda is an alleged ringleader of a drug-trafficking family that runs a 120-mile smuggling corridor on Mexico's border with Texas, according to the Drug Enforcement Administration.  He has been indicted by the U.S. government, DEA said. U.S. citizens Benjamin LeBaron and his brother-in-law, Luis Widmar, were beaten and shot to death after armed men stormed into their home in the town of Galeana, Mexico. Local media reported in July that a note found on LeBaron indicated the slayings were in retribution for the capture of 25 drug suspects in a nearby town. The LeBaron brothers belonged to the ""Community of LeBaron"" in Galeana, a township founded by excommunicated Mormons. LeBaron's younger brother, Eric, was kidnapped in May and returned unharmed a week later. The incident prompted Banjamin LeBaron to become a nationally recognized anti-crime activist who moved the local community to take a stand.","Man arrested is alleged ringleader of notorious Mexican drug-trafficking family .

"(Mashable)  -- Remember how we were all freaking out on New Year's Eve, 1999, convinced that the world as we know it would end -- at the hands of machines, of course? Well, we weathered that storm and then some. Still, as we shamble forward into the next decade, it might be prudent to take pause and take stock of the years behind us. Translation: Back up your stuff. Think of it as stockpiling food and building a fallout shelter for the 21st century. We have a ton of information, photos and memories scattered around the web that we would be loathe to lose, and while it's unlikely that the entire Internet is going to come crashing down in the next week or so, it still might be wise to put some of that stuff in an iron box for safe keeping. Read on, and Christina Warren and I will show you how to... ... back up your Facebook . We're coming pretty close to living our lives on Facebook -- it's our photo album, diary and mailbox, all in one -- so why leave all that info up to the whims of the all-mighty servers? This October, the social network got hip to data portability after it started allowing users to download their profiles -- photos, statues, updates, videos and all. The process is really too simple to forgo. Here's how you can stow away your social life for safekeeping: . 1). Go to Account Settings  2). Click on ""Download Your Information"" and allow Facebook to download your info 3). Wait for an e-mail that will let you know your info is ready (it takes a while, what with all the stuff you probably have on Facebook) 4). Go through the security test that allows you to download your info (kudos on that one, Facebook), and, voila, your profile is ported to your desktop in a nifty folder. Do this before you go through with that New Year's resolution to make your profile less scandalous -- you know, for when you're old and gray and full of sleep and nodding by the fire. ... back up your tweets . Yes, the Library of Congress is now hoarding tweets, but that doesn't do much for the casual user looking to keep a log of his own mundane musings, now does it? Thankfully, you're got some options. There's TweetStream, which lets you back up your data as well as mine it for information and statistics. (Be warned, this service takes a looooong time to gather your info). And if TweetStream doesn't strike your fancy, TweetScan, a site we covered back in 2009, will track your data back to 2007, and, using OAuth, will even grab your timeline, tweets from friends and direct messages. Pinboard, a paid, Delicious-like (RIP) tool, also lets you store your tweets -- you can also back up or archive tweets from other usernames or from hashtags, as well as add favorites from a username and turn links embedded in tweets into bookmarks. ... back up your blog . After Tumblr's epic outage the other week, we showed you all how to back up your blogs. Well, we're just going to reiterate that right now, along with some solutions for WordPress as well. Remember how you felt when your mom threw away all your old journals, crammed to the margins with angsty poetry? Well, that's not a feeling one would like to replicate later in life (unless it was relief -- in which case, disregard). Tumblr . Last year, Tumblr launched a backup app that allows users to save their blogs so that they can be viewed on any computer, burned to a CD or hosted as an archive of static HTML files. The app is super easy to use: Simply download, enter your Tumblr sign-in info and save your blog to your desktop. You can launch the app and backup more info every time you post as well. Note, this app is only for Mac OS X (10.5 or higher), but there are other options for those who use different operating systems. Wordpress . If your blog or website uses WordPress, grabbing a backup file of all your posts, pages and comments is easy. In the WordPress dashboard, just go to Tools, Export and choose what types of posts you want to export. If you want a backup of your entire WordPress database, the excellent WP-DB-Backup plugin can make scheduled database backups for your WordPress site at intervals you choose and even e-mail you the backup file. ... back up your photos . If you're like millions of Internet users, you probably upload most of your photos to a photo-sharing site like Flickr or Facebook. While you're backing up your blog entries, tweets and Facebook messages, it might be a good idea to go ahead and archive all of your photos, too. If nothing else, this is a great way to destroy the evidence from that sorority beer bong tournament in college. Flickr is a great service and in terms of reliability, it's consistently solid. What's less consistent is the whims of its parent company, Yahoo. If the Delicious debacle has taught us anything, it's that Yahoo isn't afraid to sell off or shut down a service with millions of daily users. Lots of apps and tools let you back up your Flickr photo stream, but a quick, fuss-free way to unload years of photo uploads is the Adobe Air app Flump. The app works on Mac, Windows and Linux and downloads a copy of each photo in your stream to a folder of your choice. Be aware that while this will grab each and every photo, tags, titles and photo sets are not preserved. There a few other alternatives if you're willing to invest more time in the process, but Flump gets the job done. © 2013 MASHABLE.com.

"In late 2007, a social network called Juicy Campus started going viral at a handful of colleges. But unlike Facebook, which saw a similar buzz three years earlier as a fast-spreading social network conquering one university after another, Juicy Campus encouraged its users to talk about each other, not themselves. Instead of posting party photos and calls for homework help, Juicy Campus was a social network designed to spread gossip about your peers. And to get the best gossip, Juicy Campus let its users post anonymously. You can imagine where that went. After posts of students' sexual exploits and even personal threats began to spread across Juicy Campus, some colleges attempted to block their servers from accessing the site. Fortunately, Juicy Campus didn't last long and was dead by early 2009 because it couldn't generate enough advertising revenue to stay afloat. Today, there's a new resurgence in anonymous social networks and messaging apps, which seem to be gaining traction in light of Edward Snowden's revelations that the National Security Agency has access to just about everything we do online. Some big-name investors are pumping millions into these startups, hoping one will be the next big thing to take off. There are apps such as Confide and Wickr that let you send self-destructing text or photo messages. There's Telegram, which bills itself as a more private alternative to WhatsApp. And we've all heard of Snapchat. But two other anonymous social networks seem to have captured the attention of plugged-in techies and venture capitalists more than anything else: Whisper and Secret. Both apps have received heavy financial backing. Whisper recently raised a huge $30 million round, just months after raising $21 million. Secret snagged $8.6 million from big investors such as Google Ventures. And both apps have triggered a debate about whether or not anonymous apps that encourage the spread of gossip are good for the online community as a whole. By allowing users to post anonymously, these apps encourage such personal confessions as, ""I have extreme feelings of rage when people around me chew or drink too loudly."" But they also may eventually enable hateful and defamatory gossip about people. There's also concern that people will post secrets and news that are just plain wrong, but get spun into the record as gospel. We're already seeing evidence of it, at least with Secret, which launched two months ago and has seen its share of scandalous posts. I can tell you that my feed alone, which comes from a network of friends in my iPhone's address book and ""friends of friends,"" is full of caustic gossip about venture capitalists, sexism in tech, and a healthy amount of explicit sexual fantasies. In short, it's not quite the kind of content a new startup with a fresh round of funding wants to be hosting. Secret has already taken a toll on some folks in the tech industry. Earlier this month, there was the case of Julie Ann Horvath, a former developer at GitHub who alleged harassment by her bosses after someone on Secret accused her of lying about her contributions to the company. Her tweets on the issue led to the suspension of one of GitHub's founders, pending an investigation. Legendary venture capitalist Marc Andreessen, who has invested in almost every major startup in recent years, from Facebook to the recent crop of Bitcoin payment apps, caused a stir the other day when he posted several tweets saying anonymous apps are bad for society. ""There are other systems in past & present designed to encourage negative behavior, tearing people down, making fellow souls sad,"" he wrote in one tweet. Andreessen didn't call out Secret, Whisper or any other similar apps by name, but it was clear what he was talking about and that he views such apps as havens for negativity and hate. To its credit, Secret has tried its best to tamp down the nasty posts. Its app now shows a warning to users not to post anything defamatory or insensitive about other people. Otherwise, Secret says it has the right to remove such posts. Whisper doesn't seem to have the same scandalous cloud hanging over it that Secret does, mostly because it has a team of human editors monitoring posts for naughty content. Meanwhile, Whisper's broader strategy under its newly hired editor-in-chief, Neetzan Zimmerman, is to encourage its users to break news. In fact, Whisper has teamed with BuzzFeed editors to curate news and trends from its anonymous posts. Still, it's shaky to trust a nugget of news posted anonymously on an app used predominately by a younger audience. For example, Whisper in February claimed one of its users broke a story that actress Gwyneth Paltrow was supposedly cheating on her husband, singer Chris Martin. Whisper's claims were met with the appropriate skepticism, and a rep for Paltrow issued a statement saying the Whisper post was ""100% false."" (However, she and Martin did announce their separation last month.) Perhaps that taps into the essence of why Andreessen and others aren't convinced anonymous social networks can be a long-term success. They may rise to popularity by allowing users to say whatever they want about anyone, without any repercussions. But over time you risk building a network full of lies and hate.","There's a new resurgence in anonymous social networks and messaging apps .

"(Mashable)  -- Facebook has begun rolling out a full redesign of Facebook Pages. The changes will make the Pages look and operate more like user profiles. The new Pages redesign was first seen in December, when Facebook accidentally launched it and quickly took it down. The update not only removed tabs, but it gave page admins the ability to post and comment on other Facebook Pages through a ""Login as Page"" feature. Those prototype features have made the cut for today's launch. As Facebook's Rohit Dhawan, the lead product manager for Facebook Pages, explained to me earlier today, the company has wanted to redesign Facebook Pages ever since it launched the profile redesign. ""We strongly believe you should have consistent experiences when possible,"" Dhawan said. The big difference everyone will notice will be the new layout. The left-hand menu for editing pages has been removed in favor of a new navigation menu that replaces the old tabbing system. And like the Facebook Profiles redesign, the left-hand ""Information"" box is also gone. However, page admins can now add info about their brand at the top of the page under the main title. The right-hand menu has also been tweaked. There is now a section that features the page's admins (if you so choose) as well as a section that shows users how many of their friends have also ""liked"" that particular page. Finally, just like profiles, a page can now feature relevant photos at the top. This could lead to some very creative uses for Facebook Pages. Log in as your Facebook page . There are some other notable differences between the new Facebook Pages and the old version, especially for page admins. The ""Login as Page"" feature gives admins the ability to interact with the rest of Facebook as a page, not an individual. For example, I could log in as Mashable and start commenting and ""liking"" things on Facebook Pages that have ""liked"" Mashable. Admins will also see a different News Feed if they are logged in as their page; It will display the most important news from the pages you've ""liked."" ""A page can now use Facebook as if they were an individual with the ability to interact with other pages,"" Dhawan said. ""It provides interesting content when people are visiting the page. "" Mashable: What the new Facebook pages mean for users & owners . Pages can't do everything a user can, though. Most importantly, they cannot post on a user's wall or comment on his or her status. The lone exception is for a user who has opted for the ""everybody"" privacy setting; Pages can comment on status updates for those individuals. The other update Facebook is adding is an ""Everyone"" filter that brings the most interesting and engaging posts from a page's community to the top of the page. This makes it easier for users and admins to easily find the most ""liked"" and commented-on conversations on a particular page. The new Facebook Pages are also smart enough to filter out posts that are not in a language you speak. The new design launches today as a preview for Facebook Page admins. Before switching, they can check to see what their page will look like and tweak elements of the design before launch. The company is also releasing a Page Tour and a manual to explain the new design. Admins will have until March 10 to switch over though, before Facebook automatically updates every page to the new design. © 2013 MASHABLE.com.

"Nearly two years after tech blogs screamed ""Antennagate!"" over problems with the iPhone 4's reception, owners will be getting a little pocket change for their troubles. Apple over the weekend settled a class-action lawsuit filed about the issue, promising to pay $15 or give a free case to everyone in the United States who bought one of the wildly popular phones. Released in June 2010, the slimmer reworking of Apple's smartphone became a huge seller. But soon after it went on sale, some owners began complaining that their phone frequently dropped voice calls. The culprit, it was ultimately determined, was the antenna, which is wrapped in a band around the phone's edge to help create its slim form. Using what became known as the ""death grip,"" (i.e. holding the phone at a certain spot) caused reception to suffer or cut out entirely. ""This settlement relates to a small number of customers who indicated that they experienced antenna or reception issues with their iPhone 4, and didn't want to take advantage of a free case from Apple when it was being offered in 2010,"" Apple told CNET in a written statement. However, Ira Rothken, a lead attorney in the case, said more than 21 million iPhone 4 owners were eligible for the payout. The free case offer lasted for three months. Apple had initially ignored the complaints, then dismissed them, then called a rare press conference at which then-CEO Steve Jobs announced the offer, while claiming the problem was just as bad on other companies' phones. A bumper or other protective case on the phone eliminates, or at least greatly reduces, the problem. Apple's new iPhone 4S, released in October, has not shown a similar problem. ""We believe that the Apple iPhone 4 settlement is fair, adequate, and reasonable,"" Rothken told CNET. ""We believe that it allows members of the class to choose, and they can get $15 of cash or a bumper, so we believe that type of choice is proportional to the circumstances."" Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Multiple lawsuits had been merged into one in the case. Plaintiffs claimed that Apple had been misleading in its communication with customers about the problem. Rothken first noted ""preliminary approval"" of the settlement late Friday on Twitter. Under the settlement, eligible customers should get an e-mail from Apple some time in April. They'll then have 120 days to apply for the $15. A website, iPhone4Settlement.com, has been set up but had not yet been activated as of Monday morning.","iPhone 4 owners to get $15 or free case in antenna settlement .

"(CNN) -- Officials from 14 states have gone to court to block the historic overhaul of the U.S. health care system that President Obama signed into law Tuesday, arguing  the law's requirement that individuals buy health insurance violates the Constitution. Thirteen of those officials filed suit in a federal court in Pensacola, Florida, minutes after Obama signed the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. The complaint calls the act an ""unprecedented encroachment on the sovereignty of the states"" and asks a judge to block its enforcement. ""The Constitution nowhere authorizes the United States to mandate, either directly or under threat of penalty, that all citizens and legal residents have qualifying health care coverage,"" the lawsuit states. The case was filed by Florida Attorney General Bill McCollum and joined by 11 other Republican attorneys general, along with one Democrat. McCollum said the new law also forces states ""to do things that are practically impossible to do as a practical matter, and forcing us to do it without giving any resources or money to do it."" McCollum's lawsuit was joined by his counterparts in Alabama, Colorado, Idaho, Louisiana, Michigan, Nebraska, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, South Dakota Texas, Utah and Washington. Virginia's attorney general, Ken Cuccinelli, filed a separate case in his state Tuesday afternoon. All but one of those state officials, Louisiana's Buddy Caldwell, are Republicans. But McCollum said the case is not a partisan issue and predicted other Democrats would join the suit. ""It's a question for most of us in the states of the costs to our people and to the rights and the freedoms of the individual citizens in upholding our constitutional duties as attorneys general,"" he said. White House spokesman Robert Gibbs said Monday that lawyers have advised the administration it would win the lawsuits. And Democratic Party spokesman Hari Sevugan called the lawsuit ""a waste of state funds during the worst economic crisis in a generation."" ""The American people don't want any more delay, obstruction or hypocrisy on this. They want thoughtfully implemented reform so that it works for all Americans,"" Sevugan said. Renee Landers, a law professor at Suffolk University in Massachusetts, said the Constitution gives Congress broad power to regulate commerce and promote the general welfare of Americans. ""If the federal courts follow existing precedents of the United States Supreme Court, I don't think that the claims will be successful,"" Landers told CNN. Ryan Wiggins, a spokesman for McCollum, said the case was filed in Pensacola because ""we were told that out of all of the places to file in Florida, Pensacola would move the quickest on it."" At least one of the officials who signed onto the lawsuit has run into criticism back home. Washington Gov. Chris Gregoire, a Democrat, criticized Republican Attorney General Rob McKenna for joining the case and said she would actively oppose the suit. Separately, legislatures in three dozen states are considering proposed legislation aimed at blocking elements of the health care bill. But Cal Jillson, a political science professor at Southern Methodist University in Texas, said the Constitution says laws passed by Congress trump state laws. ""We've got a very conservative Supreme Court, but they're not about to overturn 200 years of Constitutional history and interpretation and declare that the supremacy clause is no longer in effect,"" Jillson said. CNN's Peter Hamby and Jim Acosta contributed to this report.","AGs argue requirement that individuals buy health insurance violates Constitution .

"Atlanta (CNN) -- Atlanta's schools will flag suspicious test scores and achieve a culture of integrity in the wake of a cheating scandal that could lead to criminal charges against some principals and teachers, officials vowed Thursday. Interim Superintendent Erroll B. Davis Jr. received school board approval to mandate ethics training for employees and provide remedial help to perhaps thousands of Atlanta Public Schools students who may have improperly advanced because of the cheating. ""We will have a more open, transparent and empowering culture,"" said Davis. In a bid to increase stability as it seeks to overcome the scandal and receive full reaccreditation, the board extended Davis' contract through June 2012. Davis recently retired as chancellor of the University System of Georgia. Dozens of Atlanta public school educators falsified standardized tests or failed to address such misconduct in their schools, Georgia Gov. Nathan Deal said Tuesday in unveiling the results of a state investigation that confirmed widespread cheating in city schools dating as far back as 2001. Investigators said 178 teachers and principals working at 44 schools were involved in the cheating scandal. The educators, including 38 principals, were either directly involved in erasing wrong answers on a key standardized test or they knew -- or should have known -- what was going on, according to the governor's office. Deal's office said 82 of the educators acknowledged involvement, according to the report. Six principals declined to answer investigators' questions and invoked the Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination, Deal said. Davis told reporters he expects to move forward on the first personnel actions on Monday. Punishment could include termination or reassignment away from the classroom. He provided no further details. The investigation's findings have been forwarded to the state teacher licensing board, Deal said. That agency could take disciplinary action against the educators involved. Whether to bring criminal charges will be up to prosecutors, Deal said. Board members said it was important to remember that many Atlanta teachers did their jobs well. The system's former superintendent on Wednesday denied she knew of any widespread falsification by educators of student test results. Beverly Hall lashed back at a scathing state report that concluded she ""either knew or should have known cheating and other misconduct were occurring in the APS system."" ""We reaffirm Dr. Hall's position that she most definitely did not know of any widespread cheating on the CRCT (Criterion-Referenced Competency Tests) in 2009 or any other year,"" she said in a statement released through her attorney. The state's report indicated there was a climate of cheating and performance-at-all-costs during Hall's tenure. ""I do not accept a focus on performance causes people to cheat,"" Davis said. ""What motivates people to cheat ... is a climate that allows cheating to occur without consequences."" The training of test coordinators will be handled by an external group. The cheating was brought to light after marked improvements in the district's performance on the 2009 statewide CRCT revealed a pattern of incorrect test answers being erased and replaced with correct answers. Investigators compared the results with test results from other Georgia schools and found that such patterns did not occur normally, Deal said. That the district's CRCT results fell in 2010 further confirmed the findings, according to the report. Davis pledged to look at the target-setting process for teachers and conduct a survey of educators. ""I want to know if there is a climate of fear or intimidation,"" he said. At the same time, Davis said, a culture of low expectations is unacceptable. Parents and city residents seemed pleased with Davis' opening moves in what promises to be a long process in restoring credibility to the school system. ""I believe there are personnel who don't need to work with students anymore,"" said Kathryn Grogg, whose twin daughters are entering first grade and attend a school not implicated in the scandal. Marcia Klenbort, whose three children attended Atlanta Public Schools, said the school board failed to hold Hall accountable and did not adequately address the cheating before the state stepped in. While she believed Hall was supportive of schools in her neighborhood, Cynthia Briscoe Brown, co-president of North Atlanta Parents for Public Schools (NAPPS), told CNN she hopes the new superintendent will extend that to all areas of the city. NAPPS said authorities found no evidence of changed answers, test tampering or a cover-up at any of the eight schools in its cluster. Shawnna Hayes-Tavares, who has three children in the school system, said students need individualized education plans. The school activist said she is suspicious of high scores two of her children received, including a son who tested well below grade level when he transferred to another school. The solution must be twofold, said Hayes-Tavares. Administrators must ensure there are equal opportunities at all schools, she said, while parents must become more involved in their children's education -- both at school and home. U.S. Education Secretary Arne Duncan said the scandal proves there are no shortcuts to success. ""This unfortunate incident highlights the need for transparency and accountability throughout our education system,"" Duncan said in a statement Thursday. ""Having good information to measure student progress is an absolute bedrock requirement in ensuring that schools are preparing our children for success.""","School board accepts interim school chief's recommendations .

"Along the Bowery in Manhattan, people waited in a line that would challenge any fancy art gallery opening or exclusive New York City club. But what brought these people here on a cool sunny Thursday afternoon wasn't art or exclusivity, it was cats. Well, cats and coffee. Cat Café opened its doors Thursday, for cat lovers and the cat-curious to enjoy complimentary ""cat'achino"" cappuccinos, talk cat health and learn about cat adoption with 16 cuddly cats. Pet food brand Purina ONE is hosting the café as a pop-up shop, lasting only through Sunday, but organizers hope the event encourages cat health awareness and adoption. ""The goal of what we're doing here is try to start a conversation about cat health. What better place to do that then over a cup of coffee with some friends in a café? We thought if people are going to be talking about cat health, you should be among your subjects and have cats all around you,"" said Niky Roberts with Purina ONE. ""It's a great thing because dogs are very publicly social -- you can take your dog out and go for a walk, talk to people at the dog park -- but that's not a luxury most cat owners have, so this is a place you can talk with likeminded people about cat health and be among cats."" As cat people sipped cappuccinos with cat faces drawn in the foam and flicked furry, feathered balls attached to sticks by string at feline guests, Roberts said the café featured a ""Cat Chat"" speaker series with discussions led by a cat behaviorist, a veterinarian and other cat experts. Nearby, Valerie the cat had been camped out on Casey Schimon for about an hour, when someone came over to say Valerie had been adopted. ""I'm so excited for her, because she is seriously the most precious thing, and somebody is going to be very happy,"" an only slightly sad looking Schimon said. Purina ONE partnered with North Shore Animal League, a large, no-kill animal rescue and adoption organization based in Long Island, New York, to bring 16 specially chosen cats from around the country to hang out at the café. ""So far I think we've had about four cats adopted, but on Saturday we're having an event here where we'll have our mobile unit that will have additional cats available for adoption, and we're always encouraging people to come over to the shelter in Long Island where we have over a hundred adoptable cats,"" said Christina Travalja, shelter director for North Shore Animal League America. Cat coffee houses started in Asia, have gained popularity in Europe, and there are talks of opening a few in such places as California, Oregon and Canada. Bu for now, organizers say the Cat Café in New York is the first feline coffee spot in North America. ""I just want to look at cats. I really like them. I go to school here, so I'm far from my cats. I just wanted to get my fill,"" said Melissa Torres, who waited nearly two hours to get in the café, ""You hear about them in Japan, and I always thought I would have to go to Japan to go to a cat café. For those who weren't in New York or couldn't handle the line, scenes from inside the cat café were Livestreamed with more than 5,000 people watching around the world. The hashtag #CatCafe was used to spark conversations about the event and cat health on social media. By mid-day there had been more than 3,000 mentions of Cat Café on Twitter, about 74 per hour, and 178 ""news mentions"" of Cat Café. At least 30 videos had been posted with Cat Café in the title. For others, social media merely spread the word and would never make up for seeing the felines up close. ""I'm just really excited about the cat café -- hopefully I'll be able to pet some cats!"" said Stephanie Leoutsakos, who had been standing in line for a half hour and still hadn't made it around the block. John Tolas was waiting in line next to her and said, ""I heard it on Facebook, I told her, she loves cats, so now we're here.""","The Cat Cafe in Manhattan is a pop-up shop that's a first in North America .

"Ukrainian Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk signed the political elements of a trade pact with the European Union on Friday, even as Russian lawmakers finalized annexation of Ukraine's Crimea region. The signing in Brussels signals Europe's solidarity with Ukraine -- and carries additional symbolic force because it was the decision by Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych in November to ditch the trade pact in favor of closer ties with Russia that triggered the protests that led to his ouster in February and spiraled into the current crisis. It also comes a day after the European Union and the United States slapped sanctions on Russian lawmakers and businessmen; Russia responded with its own list of sanctions against a number of U.S. lawmakers and officials. In another sign of defiance, Russian President Vladimir Putin, flanked by the speakers of both houses of Parliament, signed a treaty Friday finalizing the accession to Russia of the Crimea region and its port city of Sevastopol. The upper house unanimously approved ratification of the treaty a day after Russia's lower house of Parliament, the State Duma, passed it by an overwhelming margin. The political crisis has been the biggest blow to Russia's relations with the West since the Cold War. In a sign that Western sanctions are already weighing on Russian authorities, Finance Minister Anton Siluanov said Friday in Moscow that the government will have to pay more to borrow money, state news agency ITAR-Tass said. Russia ""will look at our oil and gas revenues. If the situation is like it is now, we will probably have to give up external borrowings and cut domestic ones,"" Siluanov said. Yatsenyuk: EU speaking in one voice . Moscow has doggedly pursued its own course even as Western leaders have denounced its actions as violations of Ukraine's sovereignty and a breach of international law. Though Russia insists that its actions are legitimate, Ukraine's interim government has said Kiev will never stop fighting for Crimea. Human Rights Watch said in a statement Friday that it has concluded that the international law of occupation applies to Russian forces in Crimea. ""The occupying party is ultimately responsible for violations of international law committed by local authorities or proxy forces,"" it said. While in Brussels, Yatsenyuk held talks with European Council President Herman Van Rompuy and European Commission chief Jose Manuel Barroso. He said Russia's ratification of the treaty annexing Crimea is less important than the EU trade pact he has signed with EU leaders. ""Frankly speaking, I don't care about Russia signing this deal; I care about Ukraine, Ukrainians and our European future,"" he said. ""This deal covers more existential and most important issues, mainly security and defense cooperation."" Yatsenyuk said the European Union would ""speak in one single and strong voice"" to protect its values and defend Ukraine's territorial integrity. Van Rompuy said the deal ""shows our steadfast support for the course the people of Ukraine have courageously pursued."" EU travel bans, asset freezes . The European Union confirmed details of the sanctions against 12 Russian officials agreed to late Thursday at the EU Heads of State or Government summit. Those targeted with travel bans and asset freezes include Russian Deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Rogozin, as well as the chairwoman of the Russian upper house, Valentina Matvienko, and two Putin advisers. ""Sanctions are not a question of retaliation; they are a foreign policy tool,"" Van Rompuy said. ""Our goal is to stop Russian action against Ukraine, to restore Ukraine's sovereignty, and to achieve this, we need a negotiated solution."" He said the European Union expected soon to finalize approval of the remaining parts of the deal, particularly its economic provisions. British Prime Minister David Cameron said the European Commission will draw up further sanctions -- in finance, military and energy -- for use if the situation escalates. ""Europe is, I think, 25% or so reliant on Russian gas,"" he said. ""But if you look at Gazprom's revenues, something like 50% of them come from Europe. So, you know, Russia needs Europe more than Europe needs Russia."" Cameron said the measures agreed to in Brussels will carry a cost for Crimea, whose goods would face heavy penalties and tariffs in Europe if they are shipped through Russia, not Ukraine. EU leaders want to see an international observer mission in Crimea, preferably under the aegis of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe but, if not, sent by the European Union, Cameron said. Ban: 'Deeply concerned' A day after speaking with Putin in Moscow, U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon met Friday in Kiev with acting President Oleksandr Turchynov, then told reporters he was ""very deeply concerned"" by the tensions in parts of Ukraine and between Kiev and Moscow. ""These are some of the most traumatic and difficult times in the history of Ukraine,"" he said. Ban urged a peaceful, diplomatic resolution to the crisis and said all parties should refrain from inflammatory actions and rhetoric. U.N. Assistant Secretary-General for Human Rights Ivan Simonovic arrived Friday in Crimea for a two-day visit aimed at laying the groundwork for a U.N. human rights monitoring mission, the United Nations said. He and a team were to meet with Crimean leaders, the head of the Crimean Tatar minority and others, including the families of Ukrainian servicemen, the United Nations said. The United Nations and other organizations stand ready to assist with the country's elections, slated to be held May 25, Ban said. While in Kiev, he was also planning to meet with Yatsenyuk and other ministers and lawmakers. In another sign of solidarity with Ukraine, France is offering to strengthen a NATO air-policing mission in the Baltic area by sending four jets, a Defense Ministry spokesman said Friday. The offer, accepted by the Baltic states, was extended Friday as French Defense Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian traveled to Lithuania, Estonia and Poland, said Sacha Mandel, the minister's communication adviser. His trip followed a visit to the Baltics this week by Vice President Joe Biden. Putin's inner circle . The U.S. sanctions announced Thursday target 20 people seen as close to Putin, as well as a bank, Rossiya, believed to serve the President and senior Russian officials. Putin rejected the putative link. ""I personally didn't have an account there, but I'll definitely open it on Monday,"" he said Friday, according to the Kremlin. The individuals named by the U.S. Treasury include Putin allies in the Kremlin and in business. Among the 16 government officials are Putin's chief of staff, Sergei Ivanov; the speaker of the State Duma, Sergey Naryshkin; and Viktor Ozerov, chairman of the Security and Defense Committee of the Russian Parliament's upper house. Four others were named as members of the government's inner circle. They are financier Yuri Kovalchuk, labeled Putin's personal banker by a senior U.S. administration official; magnate Gennady Timchenko, whose activities in the energy sector have been directly linked to Putin, according to the Treasury; and businessmen Arkady and Boris Rotenberg. Washington aid . In Washington, the House Foreign Affairs Committee introduced a bill Friday that provides aid to Ukraine. ""The United States must stand with the people of Ukraine in the wake of Russia's attack on and occupation of Crimea,"" said ranking member Eliot Engel, D-New York, in a statement. ""It sends a clear message to President Putin and his corrupt cronies that we will not tolerate Russian aggression."" The House had passed a loan-guarantee bill and a non-binding resolution calling for sanctions, but Friday's legislation proposes statutory language to put those sanctions into law. President Barack Obama is to meet next week with other leaders of the so-called G7 group of industrialized nations, on the sidelines of a nuclear summit in the Netherlands. Russia has been excluded from the talks. Obama signed an executive order that authorizes further sanctions on key sectors of the Russian economy if Moscow does not act to deescalate the situation. Sanctions affect Russian markets . Washington had already announced sanctions Monday on 11 individuals; the European Union had imposed travel bans and asset freezes on 21 people. Swedish Foreign Minister Carl Bildt told CNN's Christiane Amanpour that the new round of U.S. sanctions would be ""significantly more powerful than the first one."" The latest round ""hits significant economic interests that are fairly close to the ruling circles in Moscow,"" he said. ""It will be noticed."" Markets were down Friday in Moscow, amid uncertainty in the business community. The Moscow Interbank Curency Exchange, or MICEX index, fell more than 2% -- bringing its 2014 losses to 14%. The ruble rebounded after falling early in the day; it has lost about 10% since the start of the year. In contrast, the markets and ruble had risen Monday, when the first round of sanctions was announced and did not appear to target those in Putin's inner circle. The business community now appears to fear that Putin is on a collision course with the West, and that that could undermine its interests. Russia's Foreign Ministry said Friday that it had asked Putin to draft countermeasures in response to the expanded Western sanctions. On Thursday, Moscow imposed measures against nine U.S. officials and lawmakers, including House Speaker John Boehner, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid and Sens. John McCain, Robert Menendez, Daniel Coats and Mary Landrieu, according to the Russian Foreign Ministry. Russia sanctions: EU should leave trade alone .

"The U.S. Navy rescued 282 people from six small vessels in the Mediterranean Sea after one of the boats began to sink, the military said Saturday. Five of the rescued were medically evacuated Friday to nearby Malta, and the remaining 277 people were transferred to an offshore patrol vessel belonging to Malta's military, the U.S. Navy said. The amphibious assault ship USS Bataan and the frigate USS Elrod received a call Friday from an Italian military marine patrol aircraft, which spotted the sinking boat and five others, the Navy said. The Bataan launched two helicopters, which found a sinking boat and deployed swimmers to extract people from the water, the Navy said. The Elrod sent two of its own smaller watercraft to assist. The 282 people were brought aboard the Bataan, and the Navy posted a YouTube video of the rescued people -- apparent African migrants -- looking tired or grateful as they stepped aboard the warship. The Bataan provided them with food, water, medicine and sleeping blankets, according to the video. The U.S. military didn't immediately provide further details of the rescued or their destination. But southern Italy is a frequent gateway for African refugees seeking to enter European Union countries. Men, women and children often overcrowd unseaworthy or badly equipped boats to make the journey, which sometimes result in deadly shipwrecks. The deaths of more than 300 African migrants in a shipwreck off Lampedusa last October shocked Italy and the world, and led to calls for EU lawmakers to review their migration policies. Each year, tens of thousands of people are rescued from the Mediterranean, according to the European Union border agency, Frontex.

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- The officer who arrested a top African-American professor said talks over beers Thursday evening at the White House were productive and the two men plan to meet again. Sgt. James Crowley and professor Henry Louis Gates Jr. sit down with the president and vice president Thursday. Sgt. James Crowley and Henry Louis Gates Jr. sat around a patio table with President Obama and Vice President Biden, drank beer, munched on snacks and talked about the arrest that has sparked debate about racial profiling and police procedures. ""It was a private discussion. It was a frank discussion,"" Crowley said of the meeting, but would not divulge specifics except to say that no one apologized. Crowley said he and Gates will speak by telephone in the coming days to finalize details of their next meeting. Both men bring different perspectives, he said, but he would like to hear more about Gates' views. Gates was arrested July 16 and accused of disorderly conduct after police responded to a report of a possible burglary at his Boston-area home. The charge was later dropped. Crowley and Gates, both dressed in suits, sat down with Obama and Biden, who both had their white dress shirt sleeves rolled up. Video from the meeting showed mugs of beer being delivered to the men, who sat at a round table at the edge of the White House's Rose Garden, eating peanuts and pretzels from silver bowls. The president was drinking Bud Light, Biden was drinking Buckler (a nonalcoholic beer), Gates was drinking Samuel Adams Light and Crowley was drinking Blue Moon. After the meeting, Crowley told reporters that the men had a ""cordial and productive discussion,"" in which they agreed to move foward rather than dwell on past events.  Watch Crowley discuss his visit » . After the meeting, the renowned Harvard professor reflected on the significance of the event and thanked Obama for arranging the meeting. ""It is incumbent upon Sergeant Crowley and me to utilize the great opportunity that fate has given us to foster greater sympathy among the American public for the daily perils of policing on the one hand, and for the genuine fears of racial profiling on the other hand,"" Gates said in a statement on his Web site, The Root. ""Let me say that I thank God that (I) live in a country in which police officers put their lives at risk to protect us every day, and, more than ever, I've come to understand and appreciate their daily sacrifices on our behalf. I'm also grateful that we live in a country where freedom of speech is a sacrosanct value and I hope that one day we can get to know each other better, as we began to do at the White House this afternoon over beers with President Obama,"" he said. iReport.com: Police, public share views on racial profiling . ""At this point, I am hopeful that we can all move on, and that this experience will prove an occasion for education, not recrimination. I know that Sergeant Crowley shares this goal. Both of us are eager to go back to work tomorrow."" After the incident, Obama himself quickly got involved, saying at a news conference that police in Cambridge, Massachusetts, ""acted stupidly."" His comment itself drew criticism and later he softened his stance, saying, ""I could've calibrated those words differently.""  Watch report on fallout from president's comment » . After the meeting, Obama said in a statement he was thankful to Gates and Crowley for joining him at for ""a friendly, thoughtful conversation. ""Even before we sat down for the beer, I learned that the two gentlemen spent some time together listening to one another, which is a testament to them,"" the president's statement said. ""I have always believed that what brings us together is stronger than what pulls us apart. I am confident that has happened here tonight, and I am hopeful that all of us are able to draw this positive lesson from this episode.""  Watch report from CNN's Dan Lothian on visit » . Earlier Thursday, Obama said the chat was prompted by an exchange he had with Crowley, who said in a phone call with Obama, ""Maybe I'll have a beer in the White House someday."" The president replied that that could be arranged. On the meeting's being dubbed the ""Beer Summit,"" Obama said, ""It's a clever term, but this is not a summit, guys. This is three folks having a drink at the end of the day, and hopefully giving people an opportunity to listen to each other, and that's really all it is. ""This is not a university seminar. It is not a summit. It's an attempt to have some personal interaction when an issue has become so hyped and so symbolic that you lose sight of just the fact that these are people involved,"" he said. He said he would be surprised if the media makes the meeting out to be more important than his meeting Thursday with Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo, president of the Philippines, but ""the press has surprised me before."" Gates and Crowley brought their families to the White House, and the two toured the East Wing together before the meeting, officials said. The two met Obama in the Oval Office before moving out to the Rose Garden. Their families were touring the West Wing during the sit-down. Separately, a Boston, Massachusetts, police officer became part of the controversy by referring to Gates in a mass e-mail as a ""banana-eating jungle monkey."" Officer Justin Barrett later apologized, saying he's not a racist. He told a local television station on Wednesday night that he was sorry for the e-mail. ""I regret that I used such words,"" Barrett told CNN affiliate WCVB. ""I have so many friends of every type of culture and race you can name. I am not a racist."" He was placed on administrative leave after the e-mail surfaced, and he might lose his job as a result. Barrett's attorney, Peter Marano, on Thursday offered an apology on his behalf.  Watch Boston's top cop call for discipline » . ""Justin Barrett is a citizen, a husband, a father, a soldier, a police officer and a human being,"" Marano said in a statement. ""He has made a mistake -- his poor choice in words is that mistake. His lack of thought into the possible outcome of using such words has caused this debate. Justin never intended for these words to bear such a racial connotation."" Meanwhile, a black Cambridge police sergeant on the scene the day of Gates' arrest wrote a letter to Crowley, asking him to mention to Gates and Obama that he is now known as the ""black sergeant"" and to some others as an ""uncle Tom."" ""I'm forced to ponder the notion that as a result of speaking the truth and coming to the defense of a friend and colleague, who just happens to be white, that I have somehow betrayed my heritage,"" Sgt. Leon Lashley wrote. ""Please convey my concerns to the president that Mr. Gates' actions may have caused grave and potentially irreparable harm to the struggle for racial harmony in this country and perhaps throughout the world."" Lashley wrote in the letter he would like Gates to reflect on the incident and ask himself what responsibility he bears, what he can do to heal the rift and what he can do to mitigate the damage done to the officers' reputations.","Officer says he and professor plan to meet again .

"The name ""Gloria Steinem"" has long been synonymous with feminism. As a leading figure of the women's liberation movement, since the 1960s Steinem has fought tirelessly for female emancipation through her writing and activism. As she celebrates her 80th birthday, CNN takes a closer look at how Steinem became a true symbol of gender equality. 1. Undercover agent . In 1960, a young Steinem relocated to the Big Apple to start her journalism career. Three years later, she was making a name for herself as a journalist when she showed just how far she was willing to go for a story. Dressed as a scantily clad ""bunny,"" she went undercover at Hugh Hefner's Playboy Club in New York. She then used the experience to shed light on the poor pay and working conditions women faced at the venue in her 1963 expose ""I was a Playboy Bunny."" 2. Actions over words . A decade later, Steinem had become one of the most outspoken female voices in America and was often seen as a spokesperson for gender equality. Joining forces with other notable female leaders of the day, including Betty Friedan and Bella Abzug, Steinem pushed for the Equal Rights Amendment after testifying before U.S. congress in 1970. Just two years later, the amendment was passed. In 1971, Steinem not only co-founded Ms., the first female-led magazine, but she also started up the National Women's Political Caucus -- with the mission of increasing the number of women in politics. 3. It's in her blood . Today she's seen as a feminist icon, but she's not the first woman in her family to stand up for gender equality. In 1908, Steinem's paternal grandmother spent four years as president of the Ohio Women's Suffrage Association. 4. Activist . Giving women a platform to speak and be heard wasn't Steinem's only mission. She also lent her voice to a number of other political causes. Most notably, in 1968, she took a public stance against the Vietnam War when she vowed to stop paying tax. Later in 1984, she was arrested alongside several other civil rights activists for disorderly conduct outside the South African embassy in Washington while protesting against apartheid. 5. The 'f' word . Though Steinem is credited as helping women find a voice in a traditionally male dominated society, she also redefined what it meant to be a ""feminist."" She taught us that feminism isn't just for women when she said: ""A feminist is anyone who recognizes the equality and full humanity of women and men.""

"The last two inmates who escaped through the ceiling in the shower of the Caddo County Jail in Anadarko, Oklahoma, last month have been captured, Caddo County Sheriff Gene Cain told CNN on Tuesday. James Mendonca and Triston Cheadle were taken into custody without incident at a private home in Anadarko, he said. Sheriff's deputies acted on a tip received Tuesday morning. Two other escaped inmates were caught last month. Dylan Ray Three Irons and Prime Brown were taken into custody in Chickasha, Oklahoma, the sheriff said, less than 20 miles away from the jail. News of the capture first surfaced on Twitter. The four inmates made a clean getaway October 27 after prying open a maintenance hatch in their shower -- the first escape from the 2-year-old Caddo County jail, Cain said. They broke a lock on the hatch above the shower head, Cain told CNN affiliate KFOR-TV, and then moved through a crawl space until they reached a wall, where they knocked out concrete block or two. That got them to an unlocked door outside the jail area, Cain explained. They apparently kept their clothes on in the shower. Four orange inmate uniforms were found outside the jail, CNN affiliate KOCO-TV reported. Three of the men -- Three Irons, Brown and Mendonca -- had been convicted of methamphetamine offenses and were awaiting transfer to a state prison. The fourth escapee, Cheadle, was awaiting trial on a federal gun charge, KOCO-TV reported.","The two inmates were taken into custody without incident, sheriff says .

"A lawyer representing the 16-year-old Texas boy who killed four people and critically injured two others while driving drunk lashed out Thursday at the news media for their focus on the use of ""affluenza"" to describe the boy's privileged upbringing. Of the two experts who testified in defense of Ethan Couch, only one used the word and he used it just once, attorney Reagan Wynn told CNN's ""New Day."" ""That term was not used by either of the lawyers that represented Mr. Couch, and it was not our defense, simply put."" He added, ""I think it is ridiculous for anyone who knows anything about the criminal justice system or the juvenile justice system to think that we walked into court and said, 'Hey, judge, this is a rich, white kid,' and she went, 'Oh, OK, probation.' "" Asked whether he had ever heard of a poor child getting probation -- and no jail time -- after having killed four people, Wynn acknowledged that he had not. But, he said, the goal of the juvenile justice system is to rehabilitate more than to punish. ""I would submit to you that kids who do things by accident or mistake probably should not be locked up with the key thrown away,"" he said. Eric Boyles, whose wife and daughter were killed in the crash, said he thinks the media criticism over the term caused the defense team to want the term to go away. ""I was actually surprised to hear them attempt to walk back the 'affluenza' term. They created it. The outcry follows it,"" he told ""Anderson Cooper 360"". ""And now they wish that indeed that the negative focus wasn't so much around 'affluenza.' "" Doctor coins term . Psychologist Dick Miller testified in December that ""affluenza"" describes a condition caused when a child of privileged background suffers no consequences for repeated bad behavior. But it is not recognized as a medical condition in any formal sense and Miller acknowledged to Cooper in December, ""We used to call these people 'spoiled brats.' "" The prosecutor had asked that Couch be sentenced to 20 years behind bars. Instead, State District Judge Jean Boyd ordered in December that he be placed on probation for 10 years. In a proceeding Wednesday closed to the news media, she specified the terms of that probation: She ordered that Couch undergo rehabilitation -- at his family's expense -- at a locked treatment facility in Texas that has not been identified publicly, Wynn said. No minimum time was ordered, though the boy's driver's license was suspended and he was ordered to stay away from drugs and alcohol for the duration of his sentence probation. After the proceeding, Wynn was vehement in his attack on the news media. ""If this case has not taught me anything else, it has confirmed what I was pretty sure of all along -- which is that the media circus is poison to the criminal justice system,"" Wynn told reporters on Wednesday, adding that the news coverage had affected decisions by treatment facilities about whether to accept Couch for treatment. ""The story that was reported has so twisted the facts that were actually presented in court that I don't think the truth will ever be able to come out now,"" he said. Asked what the public was missing from the news reports, he said, ""I'm not going to go into detail with you, but I will tell you that if you had been in the courtroom and you had heard all the testimony, you would have heard a significantly different story than what was reported."" Wynn's attack on the media's focus on ""affluenza"" was rich, the prosecutor said. ""Really?"" asked Richard Alpert, when told of the defense lawyer's remarks. ""Well, that's ironic, because it's his expert that brought that before the courtroom, so somebody made a decision before this hearing that that was a good term. ""He's a good attorney, his witnesses don't say things by accident. So they thought maybe that would help. That's my interpretation. And it blew up on them. It was a stupid thing to say, it affected the credibility of that expert and it will follow that expert wherever he testifies. It was a dumb idea and his testimony wasn't credible."" Looking for an apology . Couch's avoidance of jail time underscores the need for legislative changes, Alpert told reporters Wednesday. ""There are some problems with the way juvenile justice is done,"" he said. ""We're going to ask for the right to a jury trial, we're going to hope to get legislation to do that, let a jury of his peers determine what the punishment should be."" Boyles said he only wanted to hear Couch say he was sorry. ""We certainly have not seen any remorse,"" he said Thursday, adding that based on Couch's demeanor in the courtroom, he didn't think the teenager understands what he has done. Last June, his wife, Hollie Boyles, and daughter, Shelby, left their home to help Breanna Mitchell, whose SUV had broken down. Brian Jennings, a youth pastor, was driving past and also stopped to help. All four were killed when the Couch's pickup truck plowed into the pedestrians on a road in Burleson, south of Fort Worth. Couch's vehicle also struck a parked car, which then slid into another vehicle headed in the opposite direction. Two people riding in the bed of the pickup were injured. One is no longer able to move or talk because of a brain injury, while the other suffered internal injuries and broken bones. According to prosecutors, three hours after the crash, tests showed Couch had a blood alcohol content of 0.24, three times the legal limit. Lawyer: Couch does feel remorse . Despite his client's avoidance of jail time, Wynn said he didn't feel Couch won. ""There is no winner in this case,"" he said. ""Ethan is going to live with what he did for the rest of his life, and I can tell you that he certainly feels remorse."" He said his client is suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder following the accident, that he is ""emotionally and socially arrested to where he is effectively like a 12-year-old,""  and that he is ""basically shell-shocked"" by the process. ""He has a very flat affect, he is able to express remorse but, quite frankly, I don't think there is anything he was going to say to anyone that was going to make them feel any better, especially coming from him."" Marla Mitchell, whose daughter Breanna was among the victims, said Couch may have gotten off easy, but he's not done yet. ""Even though he knows how to beat this game, and even if he follows all the little things and jumps through the hoops and does the tricks he's supposed to do, I don't think the world is ever going to take their eyes off of him -- no matter where is is, no matter where he goes, no matter what game he or his family think they've beaten."" She said she hopes his rehabilitation efforts succeed, but added, ""I think it's shutting the barn door after the horse is already out. But we'll see."" Boyles said that while he took some solace in the fact Couch wasn't allowed to go to some expensive treatment facility with horse riding, yoga and other activities, he still will get to return to his nice life after he finishes his treatment. ""I had a warm, vibrant home that I went to every night. I now go home to a quiet, stark, sterile environment,"" he told Cooper. ""So it's now not a ... it's just a house. It's not a home.""","Man who lost wife, daughter says he doesn't think Ethan Couch is remorseful .

"(CNN) -- The line dividing work and leisure time is blurring right before our eyes, says one expert, and it's creating a phenomenon called ""weisure time."" English cricket player Geraint Jones enjoys a ""weisure"" moment during an Australian fishing trip in 2006. Many who haven't already abandoned the 9-to-5 workday for the 24-7 life of weisure probably will do so soon, according to New York University sociologist Dalton Conley, who coined the word. It's the next step in the evolving work-life culture. ""Increasingly, it's not clear what constitutes work and what constitutes fun,"" be it ""in an office or at home or out in the street,"" Conley said. Activities and social spaces are becoming work-play ambiguous, he says, as ""all of these worlds that were once very distinct are now blurring together."" Conley used the 1950s as a point of reference. ""Back then, there were certain rules, such as 'don't do business with friends, and keep those spheres separate.' It was just one of the hallmarks of capitalist social life. That has completely changed."" However, the increased mixing of work and play doesn't mean bankers will be refinancing houses during their kids' piñata parties. But what it does mean is more and more Americans are using smartphones and other technology to collaborate with business colleagues while hanging out with their families.  See how ""weisured"" your lifestyle is and compare with others » . It doesn't mean tax attorneys will be getting makeovers during their tax-law seminars. But they may be chatting with Facebook friends while participating in a conference call. What happened? Why do Americans want to mix work and play? Well, first, there's more work and less play, according to Conley's book ""Elsewhere, U.S.A."" ""For the first time in history now, the higher up the economic ladder you go, the more likely you're going to have an extremely long workweek,"" he says. These busier Americans often want to save time by taking care of business and pleasure simultaneously. Obviously, the Internet offers nothing but opportunity for that. 'The creative class' People are more willing to let work invade their leisure time because, for a lot of Americans, working has become more fun, Conley says. He refers to this group of professionals who tend to get more enjoyment out of work as ""the creative class,"" borrowing a term coined by author Richard Florida. Their work involves ideas -- perhaps helping create a new software product, ad campaign or creative financial derivative. ""This makes their work a source of meaning and fun to them, and thus the work-all-the-time mentality is partly driven by choice and desire,"" Conley said. It's no coincidence, Conley says, that weisure has been growing simultaneously with the popularity of the personal computer, which has helped professionals with more tedious parts of their jobs -- and has made many jobs somewhat more interesting. Weisure has been fueled by social networking sites like Facebook and MySpace, where ""friends"" may actually be business partners or work colleagues. ""Social networking as an activity is one of those ambiguous activities,"" Conley said. ""It's part fun and part instrumental in our knowledge economy."" These networking sites offer participants in the weisure life lots of ways to do business -- and to have fun. Social technology ""triggers a pleasure response in our brain that we want, even if it's quasi-junk mail, because someone's reaching out to us for a social connection. So we're addicted, some of us, me included."" 'We lose our private sphere' Perhaps more disturbing is the idea that weisure is changing us. ""We lose our so-called private sphere,"" Conley said. ""There's less relaxing time to be our so-called backstage selves when we're always mingling work and leisure."" If you're thinking that a backlash may be around the corner for the weisure concept, you're right. In fact, Conley says, the backlash has begun. ""You can see that in the populist anger against the bankers"" who've been blamed in part for the current economic downturn, Conley says. The backlash is evident in the rise of alternative social movements involving people ""who live in a more frugal and environmentally conscious way,"" he says. But, short of a nuclear winter or some cataclysm sending us back to the stone age, there's no turning back the clock on the spread of weisure, he says. The weisure lifestyle will engrain itself permanently in the American culture. Every culture creates its antithesis, Conley says. Eventually the weisure class could merge with a ""getting back to basics movement"" and form something new. ""I don't know what that will look like,"" he said. ""But this period we live in now will look very quaint and silly to folks 50 years in the future, just as the 1950s look very fake and quaint and earnest to us now.""","""Weisure"" is the blurring of work and play -- both what we do and where we do it .
Weisure is changing modern society, says NYU sociologist Dalton Conley .
""We lose our private sphere,"" he says. ""There's less time to be our backstage selves""
Why? Technology, longer workweek and more workers enjoying their jobs ."
"Ovell Smith Krell has spent the better part of her 84 years wondering how her brother died at a Florida reform school in 1940, and where he may be buried. Today, she appears to be one step closer to finding out. Florida's attorney general filed a petition on Tuesday asking a state court to approve the exhumation of an unknown number of bodies believed to be buried at the now-defunct school in the Florida panhandle town of Marianna. ""The deaths that occurred at Dozier School for Boys in Marianna are cloaked in mystery, and the surviving family members deserve a thorough examination of the site,"" stated Attorney General Pam Bondi, who filed the petition on behalf of Jackson County's medical examiner. ""I am committed to doing everything within my power to support investigative efforts to help resolve unanswered questions and bring closure to the families who lost loved ones."" Krell -- who believes her brother, Owen, was buried on the school's property -- says she's overjoyed at the news. ""We know they're there and once they start digging, then maybe we can find remains and I hope one of them is my brother,"" she told CNN. ""I want his remains brought up, and if I get my brother I would be ecstatic."" Mystery surrounds graves at boys' reform school . It's unclear when the state court will rule on Bondi's petition, although a decision could come in the next couple of weeks. If the exhumations are approved, the bodies would be examined at the University of South Florida at the direction of Jackson County's medical examiner, Michael Hunter. Forensic investigators hope to start the process before the summer rainy season. Researchers plan to use DNA from surviving family members to help identify the remains and return them to their relatives. For years, stories and allegations of beatings, torture and murder have surrounded the century-old school. State authorities have said in the past that there were 31 burial sites at the school, and a 2009 state investigation found no wrongdoing in connection with those deaths. Investigators now say there's evidence that 98 boys died at the school, and some of them may be buried in the 50 graves that forensic investigators have recently found on school grounds. In the wake of those findings, U.S. Sen. Bill Nelson, D-Florida, asked the Department of Justice to investigate. Nelson called Bondi's petition for exhumations ""a critical step forward to bring closure to the families."" The mystery surrounding the graves first made headlines in 2008 when Florida's then-governor, Charlie Crist, ordered an investigation after a group of men, known as ""the White House Boys,"" came forward with stories of how they were beaten with leather straps by school administrators inside a small, white building on school property. Robert Straley, who spent about 10 months at the school in the 1960s for allegedly stealing a car, said he was taken to the ""white house"" on his very first day. ""I came out of there in shock, and when they hit you, you went down a foot into the bed, and so hard, I couldn't believe. I didn't know what they were hitting you with,"" Straley said. Former school administrator Troy Tidwell, a one-armed man who some former students accused of beating them, has said in a deposition that ""spankings"" took place at the school but denied anyone was ever beaten or killed. The Florida Department of Law Enforcement's 2009 report said most of the 31 boys buried in the school's cemetery were killed in a 1914 fire at the facility, while others died in a 1918 flu outbreak. At the time, the law enforcement agency said it could not determine where another 50 boys -- who it said died at the school as a result of illnesses or accidents -- were buried, blaming poorly kept school records. FDLE closed the case due to the lack of evidence that anyone had died as a result of criminal conduct, and no charges were filed. Investigators say the records do not explain why the boys were buried on school property in the first place. The boys who attended the school were considered ""young offenders"" of state law and were placed in the school in order to be ""separated from older more vicious associates,"" according to the 2009 report citing the Florida Children's Commission of 1953. Florida's Department of Juvenile Justice closed the school in 2011, blaming budget cuts. Ovell Krell said her family was told that her brother Owen ran away from the reform school, got pneumonia, and died underneath a house in town. ""They said that the body was so decomposed, you wouldn't be able to identify him ... they took him straight out to the school and buried him,"" she told CNN. But Owen's classmate told the family a different story, Krell said. According to Krell, the boy said as he and Owen tried to escape, ""my brother was running out across a field, an open field, and there was three men shooting at him, with rifles."" ""I believe to this day that they shot my brother that night, and I think they probably killed him and brought him back to the school and buried him,"" she said. Today, she simply wants to bring him home. She's 84 now, and says she's running out of time. ""My mom never got a good night's sleep the rest of her life after Owen went missing,"" she said. ""I'd make sure he's put with my mom and dad. It will probably be their first good night's sleep in over 70 years.""","Florida's attorney general has requested a court allow exhumations at a defunct school .

"With computer technology advancing at an ever bewildering pace, it's comforting to know that one little feature remains steadfastly future-proof and, more importantly, foolproof. The USB (Universal Serial Bus) is as relevant today as it was when the 12 millimeter by 4.5 millimeter ports and cables first started appearing back in the late 1990s, providing users with a discreet and straightforward way of transferring data between a range of digital devices. Today, more than 10 billion USB devices are believed to be in use around the world -- a statistic that has secured its co-inventor, Ajay Bhatt, a permanent place in computing's unofficial hall of fame. ""I was totally surprised by how it has impacted everybody. I mean, my name became a common name -- at least at schools and in technical communities,"" Bhatt said. The engineer's high standing in computing circles was famously celebrated in a 2009 advertising campaign by his employers, Intel, where an actor portraying Bhatt strutted into a lab full of starstruck co-workers. ""I truly get a rock star treatment and that is quite unusual to me -- people asking for your signature, people asking for your picture."" His journey to digital immortality began in the early 1990s amid the growing tangle of chunky cables and portals which linked the separate devices on PCs and laptops. One cable would talk to the keyboard, Bhatt recalls, while another would connect a modem. A different cable enabled printing, with another linking the hard drive to the monitor. ""It was more difficult than it needed to be,"" he says. ""You were looking at two devices with connecting wires and you wanted things to happen but the rules weren't that simple. It was very difficult for the average person to use it. All the technology at that point was developed for technologists by technologists."" He set about creating a single connection for computers across the entire industry. For six years he lobbied colleagues at Intel and then at other computer firms, urging everyone to jump on the bus. ""Initially, it was difficult for them to understand the merits. We had a big tent and we included everybody, we listened to everybody's input and tried to address them to the best of our abilities and that's why USB is successful,"" Bhatt said. It was all easier said than done, he says, requiring a radical change in the industry's eco-system. ""In order to be successful in anything like this you have to look at the problem from their perspective. So, if I went to, say, Compaq -- which is now (owned by) Hewlett-Packard -- we used to think about their issues and what problems they faced,"" he said. USB was good because it addressed some of the customer satisfaction issues while also helping computer hardware manufacturers to save money. Bhatt's own commercial expectations for his invention were initially quite modest. ""I thought this was a (one off) $40 million opportunity,"" he says. ""I couldn't imagine where USB has gone or where it will continue to go. This has exceeded the wildest of my imaginations."" The first model (USB 1) arrived on the market in the late 1990s and was an instant hit. Later versions -- USB 2.0 released 2000 and USB 3.0 which debuted in 2008 -- have vastly improved data transfer speeds. ""USB 3.0 is 400 times faster (than our original USB) and as we go forward I see USB going to 816 times faster,"" Bhatt says. ""It's evolving. The great part of USB is that the first device that you bought can still work with computers today, and hopefully it will work with computers in the future."" Today, around two billion USB's are shipped every year, with millions being sold every day. But the project has never been about the money, says the 56-year-old. ""Somebody interviewed me once and they said, I don't know, I don't know, if I made a penny per USB point and Intel made a penny per USB point then we would have made a lot of money,"" he says. ""I think what we did was we created an open standard that everybody can benefit. What I am happy to see is that everybody participates in this eco-system and they are all making money."" The real bottom line for Bhatt though has been an enduring sense of worth in his own personal capital. ""I think for any engineer to see your ideas, your visions on a shelf on a store is an incredible feeling -- you know, because you created something, you imagined something,"" he says. ""A lot of people told you that this couldn't be done and then you go to the store or talk to users. They'll all delighted by the USB, how easy it is. It makes you feel good.""","Intel's Ajay Bhatt explains how he created industry standard USB device .

"WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- Former Vice President Dick Cheney said Monday that he does not believe Saddam Hussein was involved in the planning or execution of the September 11, 2001, attacks. Former Vice President Dick Cheney says Saddam Hussein ""provided sanctuary ... and resources to terrorists."" He strongly defended the Bush administration's decision to invade Iraq, however, arguing that Hussein's previous support for known terrorists was a serious danger after 9/11. Cheney, in an appearance at the National Press Club, also said he is intent on speaking out in defense of the Bush administration's national security record because ""a clear understanding of policies that worked [in protecting the United States] is essential."" ""I do not believe and have never seen any evidence to confirm that [Hussein] was involved in 9/11. We had that reporting for a while, [but] eventually it turned out not to be true,"" Cheney conceded. But Hussein was ""somebody who provided sanctuary and safe harbor and resources to terrorists. ... [It] is, without question, a fact."" Cheney restated his claim that ""there was a relationship between al Qaeda and Iraq that stretched back 10 years. It's not something I made up. ... We know for a fact that Saddam Hussein was a sponsor -- a state sponsor -- of terror. It's not my judgment. That was the judgment of our [intelligence community] and State Department."" The former vice president said in 2004 that the evidence was ""overwhelming"" that al Qaeda had a relationship with Hussein's regime in Iraq, and that media reports suggesting that the commission investigating the 9/11 attacks reached a contradictory conclusion were ""irresponsible."" ""There clearly was a relationship. It's been testified to. The evidence is overwhelming,"" Cheney said at the time. ""It goes back to the early '90s. It involves a whole series of contacts, high-level contacts with Osama bin Laden and Iraqi intelligence officials."" On Monday, though, Cheney identified former CIA Director George Tenet as the ""prime source of information"" on the relationship between Iraq and al Qaeda. Tenet ""testified, if you go back and check the record, in the fall of [2002] before the Senate Intelligence Committee -- in open session -- that there was a relationship,"" Cheney said. Hussein was captured by U.S. forces in Iraq in December 2003. In November 2006, the former Iraqi leader was convicted of crimes against humanity and sentenced to death. He was executed the following December. Cheney said on June 17, 2004 that the evidence was ""overwhelming"" that al Qaeda had a relationship with Hussein's regime in Iraq, and said media reports suggesting that the 9/11 commission has reached a contradictory conclusion were ""irresponsible."" Among other things Monday, Cheney also called the Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, detention center a ""good facility ... if you are going to be engaged in a world conflict, such as we are, in terms of global war on terrorism. You know, if you don't have a place where you can hold these people, the only other option is to kill them. And we don't operate that way.""  Watch what Cheney has to say about the detention facility » . He reiterated his call for President Obama to declassify documents detailing the results of ""enhanced interrogations"" of high-value detainees. Since Obama has already released memos detailing the interrogation methods, Cheney said, it is important to share the results of those interrogations with the public as well. ""I would not ordinarily be leading the charge to declassify classified information, otherwise they wouldn't call me Darth Vader for nothing,"" Cheney said. But ""once the [Obama] administration released the legal memos that gave the opinions that were used to guide the interrogation program, they'd given away the store. ... I [therefore] thought it was important to have the results that were gained from that interrogation program front and center as well."" On May 14, the CIA rejected the former vice president's request to declassify the documents. CIA spokesman Paul Gimigliano, in a written statement, said the two documents are the subject of pending lawsuits and therefore cannot be declassified. Cheney said Monday that the memos previously released also were the subject of ongoing lawsuits. He said Obama can release the additional documents with ""the stroke of a pen."" On May 21, Cheney gave a full-throated defense of the Bush administration's enhanced interrogations of al Qaeda prisoners during an appearance at the conservative American Enterprise Institute. He has said that the interrogations saved the lives of ""thousands, perhaps hundreds of thousands."" He called the techniques the Bush administration approved ""legal, essential, justified, successful and the right thing to do.""","Ex-VP backs Bush administration invasion of Iraq, says Hussein supported terror .

"In February, President Barack Obama launched an initiative to provide educational and community support for African-American boys and young men, an issue he said ""goes to the very heart of why I ran for president."" But when Obama first unveiled the ""My Brother's Keeper"" program six months ago, he could not have anticipated that the national conversation this summer would explode into a debate about race relations. In light of the death of Michael Brown -- the unarmed African-American teen who was fatally shot by a white police officer in Ferguson, Missouri, in August -- Obama said that the country is now ""awakened"" to a reality that a ""gulf of mistrust"" exists between African-Americans and law enforcement officials in communities throughout the country. ""We still have to close the opportunity gaps, and we have to close the justice gap -- how justice is applied, but also what is perceived, how it is experienced,"" Obama said at a Congressional Black Caucus Foundation event in Washington on Saturday. ""That's what we saw in Ferguson this summer when Michael Brown was killed and the community was divided."" ""Too many young men of color feel targeted by law enforcement, guilty of walking while black, driving while black, judged by stereotypes that fuel by fear and resentment and hopelessness,"" he continued. To Brown's family members, who were in the audience at the event, Obama gave a personal nod. ""I know that nothing anybody can say can ease the grief of losing a child too soon."" Complete coverage of Ferguson . As a result of the increasingly evident ""gulf of mistrust,"" Obama said, his administration will launch a ""My Brother's Keeper"" community challenge this week, in which it will ask every community in the country to publicly commit to implementing strategies to ensure that all young people can succeed. ""It's a challenge to local leaders to follow the evidence and to use the resources to see what works on our kids,"" the President said. ""We need to help our communities, our law enforcement build trust, build understanding, so that our neighborhoods stay safe and our young people stay on track."" The operation was originally launched with the plan to have leading foundations and businesses donate at least $200 million over five years toward mentoring programs aimed at boys and young men of color. Obama also thanked Attorney General Eric Holder, who announced his retirement last week, for his continued effort to improve race relations and advance civil rights. ""Throughout his long career in public service, Eric has built a powerful legacy of making sure that equal justice under the law actually means something,"" Obama said. ""He's been a great friend of mine. He's been a great servant of the American people. We will miss him badly."" Obama's remarks came at the end of a four-day annual legislative conference sponsored by the Congressional Black Caucus Foundation, a nonprofit institute that supports the policy positions of the Congressional Black Caucus.","Administration will launch a ""My Brother's Keeper"" community challenge this week .

"(CareerBuilder.com) -- Leadership is one of those nebulous terms -- you hear it all the time but it has various definitions. The traits that make up a good leader can vary depending on the organization, team, manager and work environment. Leadership can also vary in style -- are you someone who dictates the group and doesn't listen to anyone else's opinion? Or do you lead with a more bureaucratic or democratic style? ""Every leader has a particular style of leadership that is innate. However, the behaviors, attitudes or methods of delivery that are effective for one staff member may in fact be counterproductive for another,"" says Michael Burke, account supervisor, MSR Communications, a public relations firm. ""Great leaders are aware of their own style and make the effort to learn how their style actually comes across to their team. They learn to flex their leadership style to individual team members so that they communicate and behave in ways that motivate and inspire."" Here is what five leadership professionals consider to be traits that make up a good leader: . Rachael Fisher-Layne, vice president of media relations, JCPR, a public relations agency . 1. Honesty. Always do the honest thing. It makes employees feel like they know where they stand with you at all times. 2. Focus. Know where you're going and have a strong stated mission to lead people on. If you're not sure, how can your people be sure? You have to have strong focus and stay the course. 3. Passion. Whatever it is, you must have passion for what you're doing. Live, breathe, eat and sleep your mission. 4. Respect. Not playing favorites with people and treating all people -- no matter what station in life, what class or what rank in the org chart -- the same. 5. Excellent persuasion abilities. People have to believe in you and your credibility. Image is everything and the belief people have in you, your product, your mission, your facts or your reputation are key to being a great leader. You have to persuade people of this -- it doesn't just happen. Darcy Eikenberg, a leadership and workplace coach, Red Cape Revolution . 1. Confidence. If you don't believe in yourself, no one will. I hear leaders worrying that if they show too much confidence, others will think them arrogant. The reality is people want to know what you know for sure -- and what you don't. Having the confidence to say ""I don't know"" is a powerful skill. 2. Clarity. The only way you can get confidence is by becoming really, really clear about who you are and what is most important to you. New leaders fail when they try to become all things to all people, or try to do too much out of their area of excellence. Clarity helps you say ""yes"" to the right things -- and ""no"" to others. 3. Care. The strongest, most effective leaders I've met care not just about the business, but about the people in it and the people impacted by it. Plus, they show they care through their words and actions, even proving how they care for themselves and their family by taking unplugged vacations and continuing their own professional development. Care shouldn't be a four-letter word in our workplace today -- and the best leaders know it. Tom Armour, co-founder, High Return Selection, a recruitment firm . 1. Integrity. They are people who are respected and worth listening to. I find in general due to all of the economic difficulties, employees prioritize and seek leaders and organizations that are honest and meet their commitments. 2. Compassion. Too many leaders these days manage with the balance sheet, often times at the expense of their employees and long-term customer relationships. Talented people want to work for leaders and organizations that truly care about their employees and the communities in which they operate. 3. Shared vision and actions. People produce real business gains and smart people need to understand what is needed and be part of the solution. 4. Engagement. Great business leaders are able to get all members of their teams engaged. They do this by offering them challenge, seeking their ideas and contributions and providing them with recognition for their contributions. 5. Celebration. In today's work environment, people are working very long hours and they need to take some time to celebrate their successes in order to recharge their batteries. Those leaders who fail to do this create burnout environment overtime. Mike Sprouse, CMO, Epic Media Group, and author of ""The Greatness Gap"" 1. Humility. True leaders have confidence but realize the point at which it becomes hubris. 2. Empowering. True leaders make their associates feel emboldened and powerful, not diminished and powerless. 3. Collaborative. True leaders solicit input and feedback from those around them so that everyone feels part of the process. 4. Communicative. True leaders share their vision or strategy often with those around them. 5. Fearlessness. True leaders are not afraid to take risks or make mistakes. True leaders make mistakes born from risk. Nancy Clark, author of ""18 Holes for Leadership"" 1. Genuine. You need to be clear on what your values are and must be consistent in applying them. As part of that, you need to have the courage to hold true to them. You must not lose sight of reality. Lost values may be one of the biggest causes of downfalls. 2. Self-awareness. You need to be clear on what your strengths are and what complementary strengths you need from others. This includes understanding others and learning how best to utilize their strengths. Many unsophisticated leaders think everyone should be like them; that too can cause their downfall. They surround themselves with people like them. ""Group think"" can blindside them and cause failure. 3. Leverage team strengths. Part of awareness is don't expect people to change. If you think you can change someone, think again. This doesn't mean you can't help them grow and develop. But don't expect to change anyone (even yourself) behaviorally. We are who we are. Your job as a leader is to understand each person's strengths and place them in positions where they can flourish and grow. If you are good at that, you have a huge part of the equation for success. 4. Leadership transitions. Going from individual contributor to supervisor is only the first of many transitions along the leadership pipeline. You need to understand the business model, how it applies to your current position, what you need to do to provide the greatest value, and how to leverage your strengths at this level. This requires building competencies and focusing on the right things. No one ever tells you that there are many levels and many adjustments you need to make along the way. 5. Supportive. You need to foster a positive environment that allows your team to flourish. Also by aligning the reward and recognition systems that best match your teams profile and deliver results. &copy CareerBuilder.com 2011. All rights reserved.

"The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has sent out a warning to hospitals about a new antibiotic-resistant bacteria, carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae, or CRE. While this strain of bacteria is not new, it has become more common in the last 10 years or so and has now become prevalent enough to warrant a higher level of concern. It's worth backing up for a second to discuss what all of this means. We use antibiotics to treat bacterial infections. When we first started developing antibiotics, such infections were easier to cure. But over time, the bacteria evolved. They developed the ability to fight the antibiotics that we use. They pass on this ability to resist treatment to bacteria that follow. Over time, we are often forced to develop new antibiotics to beat infections that were previously treated easily. News: CDC: 'Nightmare bacteria' spreading . This is what has happened here with CRE. Over time, these bacteria have become harder and harder to treat. The old antibiotics don't work as well. In this case, CRE infections kill about half of patients who have bloodstream infections. This is more than twice as many people who die from similar infections with antibiotic-susceptible strains. Right now, CRE only are of concern to certain susceptible patients in the hospital. It's not common in the community, and most of the warnings are directed at hospitals, imploring them to take precautions to isolate patients and prevent spread in the inpatient setting. The nightmare scenario, though, is that this bacteria will get out into the community. This isn't fear-mongering. Years ago, Staphylococcus aureus infections were also relatively easy to treat. Over time, though, a strain of bacteria, known as Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, or MRSA, became a problem in hospitals. The CDC issued warnings to hospitals to take precautions to prevent its spread. Over time, though, it got out into the community. A 2008 study of children who came into an emergency department with skin abscesses, or infections, found that about 75% of them were caused by MRSA. Luckily, we still have medications, such as trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, to treat these infections. When that fails, though, things will become even more concerning. Put another way, when I was training, we would have almost never considered MRSA as the cause of a skin infection. These days, though, we pretty much assume it's the cause, and treat with stronger drugs. Most people believe that the injudicious use of antibiotics is to blame for these developments. Every time we use antibiotics, we give bacteria a chance to evolve. We kill off those susceptible to the drugs and leave those that have developed resistance. Each time we use antibiotics unnecessarily, say to treat a virus, we make the problem worse. Each time we use them improperly, or for too short a period of time, we do the same. These days, we're putting them in everything, from soap, to lotion, to the food that animals eat. This is a real public health issue. Creating more resistant strains is a serious long-term problem. The new warning is panicking a lot of people, but for the wrong reasons. You're very, very unlikely to get a CRE infection anytime in the near future. It's important that hospitals work to prevent that problem from getting worse, but almost everyone reading about it this week will be unaffected by it. It's much, much more likely, though, that these same people will ask for antibiotics when they get a cold. That's the kind of thing that will lead to future problems. That's the kind of thing we need to stop now.","Aaron Carroll says rise in drug-resistant bacteria CRE should concern us all .
He says bacterial strains -- like MSRA a few years ago -- evolve to resist antibiotics .

"(CNN) -- Eye-popping physiques, multimillion dollar incomes, celebrity status -- and that's just the women. When you're dating one of the top footballers on the planet, the pressure to be ""perfect"" is huge. In football's answer to Hollywood, media scrutiny of elite players is fierce. And the paparazzi is just as hungry for images of their wives and girlfriends -- dubbed ""WAGs"" by the British tabloids. Lenses are snapped with even more ferocity during the World Cup, as Nancy Dell'Olio, former partner to ex-England team manager Sven-Goran Eriksson, found out to her cost. ""It is quite sexist and in many cases really not quite fair, the way they were looking at partners,"" said the glamorous 52-year-old American-Italian lawyer, in her lilting European accent. ""It was quite intrusive, and that was independent of my will,"" added Dell'Olio, who for almost a decade watched her high-profile relationship play out across the front and back pages of the press. ""But when you are next to a personality so important in football you become absorbed in that role."" As with all social groups, there was a WAG hierarchy. ""There's a difference between if you are the partner of the manager, than if you are the partner of a footballer,"" says Dell'Olio in between sips of ginger tea, at London's swank member's only Club at the Ivy. ""It was always 'Nancy Dell'Olio plus any other of what you might call WAGs,'"" she adds with a raised eyebrow. ""So in this way I was quite distinctive, I was never part of that world."" She's got the look . It's a world of glossy women with shopping habits as expensive as their bodies, if you believe the stereotypes splashed across celebrity magazines. In truth, partners face enormous pressures to live up to Barbie doll ideals of beauty. ""No one wants to be the ugly WAG,"" says author and newspaper columnist ""The Secret WAG,"" wife of an England player who has kept her identity a mystery, while revealing the inner workings of her lavish lifestyle. ""We're put under so much pressure to look as perfect as we can. We're all striving to be the thinnest, the prettiest, the one with the nicest hair."" The relentless drive for perfection comes from a fear of ""being traded in for a newer model"" when temptation beckons, she says. ""Mostly it's our own personal insecurities, because you know footballers don't have great reputations. There's so many kiss-and-tell stories in the newspapers, and we all live in fear that this is going to happen to us. ""Footballers today aren't just guys who kick a ball about. They're celebrities. They're dating supermodels, actresses. ""For us normal girls who don't have careers in the public eye, it's a massive pressure to live up to."" Power couple . That's not to say the partners of footballers are simply pretty accessories -- in some cases, they're even more famous than their sporting beaus. Victoria Beckham and Shakira needn't rely on high-profile lovers David Beckham and Gerard Pique for their own successful music careers. Though it does help. ""Coleen Rooney's book has sold more copies than her husband Wayne's,"" said Alison Kervin, sports editor of British newspaper the Mail on Sunday, and author of ""WAGs at the World Cup."" ""It's a really interesting phenomenon to get your head around, because she's only famous because she's going out with a successful England footballer."" Cinderella story? With top players earning over $70 million a year, dating one can be an instant ticket to fame and fortune. ""A footballer could take you from a world where you're living a basic existence in social housing, to living in a multimillion dollar mansion and traveling the world,"" says Kervin. ""It has a Cinderella quality to it, and I think that's what we find so appealing."" Already a successful property lawyer in Italy by the time she met Eriksson, Dell'Olio's is hardly a rags to riches tale. But since dating the Swede, she has become a British celebrity in her own right, hosting TV program ""Footballers Cribs,"" appearing on ""Strictly Come Dancing,"" and soon to perform her own stand-up show at Edinburgh's Fringe Festival. She admits the relationship ""probably did help"" raise her public profile. ""But it's not the only thing,"" says the immaculate entrepreneur in a stylish lemon two-piece skirt suit, her raven hair loosely piled high. As for the suggestion women pursue footballers as a career move -- Dell'Olio's eyes open wide in horror. ""I find it ridiculous this opinion,"" she says haughtily, her earrings jangling in agreement. ""And negative, because there's a lot of jealousy involved probably. But it's a little bit stupid, if you don't mind me saying. ""Of course it's only about love. Every couple together, it should be love."" Give and take . Dating a footballer is not a relationship for the fainthearted, with women beholden to clubs just as much as their men. If that means abstaining in the bedroom before big matches, then so be it. ""It's really unfair,"" says ""The Secret WAG."" ""My whole life has kind of been following my husband around, you have to up and leave countless times when he moves clubs. ""I spent many years studying and I've never been in a situation where I could put all those years to good use. ""I feel as though I'm constantly living in the shadow of my husband, and it took a lot of adjustment to accept that."" British phenomenon? Nowhere is the spotlight so intense on footballer's private lives then in the UK -- ""this is the country of gossip,"" says Dell'Olio. The word ""WAG"" was dreamed up by the British tabloids during the 2006 World Cup, and has since made its way into the Oxford Dictionary. At the time, just as much column space was dedicated to Victoria Beckham and Cheryl Cole's shopping sprees, as England's lackluster performance in Germany eight years ago. ""I think it was a mixture of England not doing particularly well, so there was nothing much to report on, and the girls just out partying,"" says Kervin. ""You can be very critical of these women and you can analyze what happened to feminism, but the bottom line is, they seem to be having a bloody good time."" Glamorous as these women may seem, ultimately they are just ""normal people trying to be the best mothers and wives they can,"" says the ""Secret WAG."" Normal people, that is, with exceptional lives. Pictures: 32 players to watch at World Cup .

"(CNN) -- South Sudan's military has quashed an attempted coup, President Salva Kiir said Monday, after heavy gunfire gripped the capital of Juba. Dressed in fatigues and flanked by government officials, Kiir blamed soldiers loyal to his sacked deputy Riek Machar for starting the fighting. In a televised address, he said the government was in full control of the capital, and announced a nighttime curfew. ""They tried to carry out a coup -- a so-called coup d'etat -- but they have failed,"" Kiir said. ""All the people who were involved in this will be arrested."" He said a nighttime curfew ""for the sake of security and safety of our citizens"" would run from 6 p.m. until 6 a.m. A move by Kiir to dismiss his Cabinet in July has further inflamed deep-running tensions between Kiir's Dinka community and Machar's Nuer community. Earlier, heavy gunfire was reported in the city, government official Peter Biar Ajak said. The U.S. and British embassies in Juba urged their citizens via Twitter to stay indoors and be cautious. ""Gunshots/artillery fired over the past few hours in several locations in Juba,"" the U.S. Mission in Juba tweeted. Sporadic gunfire . In a statement on its Facebook page, the U.S. Embassy said that while there was now a lull in violence, it continued to receive reports of sporadic gunfire in parts of the city, particularly near Juba University. It said the airport was not operational. It recommended that U.S. citizens use ""caution at this time,"" adding that travel in Juba was not currently safe. It also reiterated an earlier tweet denying Machar had taken shelter there. ""We take this opportunity to reaffirm our earlier message that no political or military figures have taken refuge within the U.S. Embassy,"" the mission said. In a separate statement, the embassy said it was ""deeply concerned at the recent outbreak of armed violence"" in Juba and echoed calls from the U.N. envoy there for all parties to ""cease hostilities immediately and exercise restraint."" The British Embassy has issued an alert advising British nationals against all nonessential movement in parts of the country. South Sudan formally split from Sudan in 2011, after decades of conflict. Numerous armed groups remain active in the oil-rich country. Women, children flee to U.N. compound . Hundreds of people, mainly women and children, have taken shelter at the U.N. compound near the airport and at a U.N. house in the city, the United Nations Mission in South Sudan (UNMISS) said. ""We hope the security situation in Juba will quickly normalize to enable the civilians to return very soon to their residential areas. To that end, UNMISS calls on all parties to show continued calm and restraint,"" it said in a statement. It also denied ""any suggestion that the U.N. Mission is harboring any key political or military figures.""

"(CNN) -- The Internet is one of the most powerful tools on the planet. Across the globe, millions of people connect every minute of every day to harness its wealth of information, exchange ideas in an open platform and foster the type of innovation and entrepreneurship that spurs economic growth. And today, it's never been more at risk in the United States. Earlier this year, a court decision unlocked the ""pandora's box."" There are now no enforceable rules to ensure small businesses, nonprofits and individuals can continue to access online content without fear of discriminatory practices or content blocking by Internet service providers who own the information pipelines. Indeed, without new rules, service providers could create fast lanes, impose new fees, and even block certain content and promote other content to bolster their bottom line. This would destroy the open Internet as we know it. This is not idle speculation. Executives at cable and phone companies have expressed a desire to engage in such activities, and in fact, have already tried to do so. If we permit blocking, discrimination, and tolls, we will undermine the Internet's low-cost level playing field that has transformed our society, created an economic boom, and provided opportunity to so many in the United States and around the world. In the last few decades, we have seen first-hand how the open Internet has led to a robust startup economy where Americans create content, solve problems and pioneer new technologies that improve the lives of people across the globe. Businesses like Twitter, YouTube, Tumblr, Google, Facebook and more have emerged because they were able to start on an even playing field, where consumers -- not Internet service providers -- determined their success. Degrading service or forcing businesses to pay-to-play would fundamentally undermine the openness and access on which the Internet has thrived. To allow the Internet to become a bastion of powerful incumbents and carriers would be a mistake of historic proportions. Instead, it must remain a place where all speakers, creators and innovators can harness its transformative power now and in the future. Fortunately, we do not need to create new laws or a complex regulatory structure to preserve the Internet as we know it. Instead, the Federal Communications Commission can pass rules that prevent toll booths, content blocking and discrimination by simply reclassifying broadband as a common carrier service under Title II of the Communications Act. All the FCC would be doing is applying the legal framework that Congress expected it to apply, and that both Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia and President Barack Obama agree is the correct approach. In other words, the legal tools are there and ready to use. Some worry that this approach could be overly burdensome on Internet service providers, but the fact is, the FCC can easily apply only the necessary parts of Title II regulation through a process known as forbearance. This flexible approach would allow the FCC to adopt bright-line rules that provide certainty to the market, and would keep the Internet as a powerful, open platform that gives everyone -- not just the highest-bidder -- the opportunity to freely exchange goods and ideas. Any approach that stops short of reclassifying broadband under Title II will not allow the FCC to adopt the rules we need today to protect customers and businesses, and will result in high social and economic costs. All other approaches require case-by-case adjudication, leading to never-ending litigation (which, in itself, disproportionately harms small businesses and start-ups), market uncertainty, high costs of regulation and opportunities for regulatory overreach. Title II has already worked well to strengthen telecommunications in the United States. Under Title II regulation, telephone service has been robust and accessible. Mobile phone service, also a Title II service, continues to thrive and investment has remained steady and more and more individuals turn to mobile as their primary voice service. While many do not realize it, Title II also applies to the broadband services offered to the nation's large businesses, known as enterprise broadband, and to the many services offered to millions of our rural Americans. An open Internet is not only essential for the future of America's economic growth, but it is also a ladder for social and economic mobility, allowing families in rural or low-income areas to access educational and social services, participate in our democracy and contribute to the marketplace of ideas. This is why we have been working with our colleagues in Congress to encourage the FCC to protect the open Internet under Title II. Adopting these sensible rules would give the FCC the power to intervene if broadband providers attempt to abuse the principles of the open Internet while also creating market and regulatory certainty. We are proud to join more than 4 million Americans of all political beliefs, as well as companies in our home states and across the country, who have spoken out in favor of strong open Internet rules and against the creation of fast and slow lanes. We urge the FCC to act quickly to implement fair rules of the road that protect businesses and consumers and preserve the power of the open Internet. The future of our democracy and economy depend on it.","Cory Booker, Angus King: Internet is the most powerful tool in the world, but it's at risk .

"PALM BEACH, Florida (CNN) -- Following a faint trail through a dense patch of woods in Florida's Palm Beach County, Roy Foster is a man on a mission. Roy Foster's facility, Stand Down House, has helped about 900 male veterans since 2000. Foster, 53, is searching for homeless veterans -- and he knows where to look. Whether in a vacant lot behind a supermarket or a small clearing off the highway, homeless vets aren't that hard to find: One in three homeless adults has served in the military, and more than 150,000 veterans nationwide are homeless on any given night, according to the Veterans Administration. Working with the sheriff's homeless outreach unit, Foster finds vets camped in tents or makeshift lean-tos, where he delivers a message: There's help for you if you want it. ""For our heroes to be living in [these] conditions, it's totally unacceptable,"" said Foster. Since 2000, approximately 900 veterans have found life-changing help at Foster's facility, Stand Down House. Named for the military command that gives troops time to rest after arduous duty, the program provides homeless male vets food, shelter and a safe place to recover, as well as the tools to conquer their personal problems. Vote now for the CNN Hero of the Year . ""The idea is that they can relax now; we'll take care of them,"" Foster said. Foster's motivation to help these men is personal: He used to be one of them. Born in rural Georgia, he joined the Army right after high school. During his six years in the military, he began drinking and experimenting with drugs. He was an alcoholic by the time he left the Army in 1980, and his drinking and drug use escalated as he struggled to adjust to civilian life. He spent the next decade battling his addictions, and at his lowest, he slept in flophouses or on the streets. ""I was pretty much out of control,"" Foster said. ""I felt hopeless, helpless, ashamed and inadequate."" While struggling to get clean, Foster had difficulty finding a program that accepted veterans and provided the recovery services he needed, he said. The experience inspired him to design a program specifically for his brothers-in-arms. ""That's when the commitment in my heart was born,"" Foster said. By the early 1990s, Foster settled into a life of sobriety, becoming a substance abuse counselor. Seeing that many vets continued to fall through the cracks, he joined forces with another vet, the late Don Reed, and established the nonprofit Faith*Hope*Love*Charity. After six years, Faith*Hope*Love*Charity created Stand Down House. Now five buildings in total, Stand Down House provides transitional housing and support services to 45 veterans in different stages of recovery. When vets arrive -- through referral by the Veterans Administration, which largely funds the program -- they receive meals, housing, clothing, counseling and transportation to the VA hospital for additional medical and mental health care. After 30 to 60 days, eligible veterans must begin to look for work or attend school, but they can continue receiving housing, case management, addiction counseling and life skills classes for as long as two years. Successful veterans are eligible for the program's final component: permanent, sober-living housing.  Watch Foster seek out homeless veterans with the county sheriff » . The camaraderie the veterans find with each other at Stand Down House is another vital component of their recovery process. ""It was great to realize that other vets had been through similar experiences,"" said Matt Robinson, 28, who served in Iraq as a member of the U.S. Army National Guard.  Watch Robinson describe his experience at Stand Down House » . With their past as a common bond, vets often become informal counselors to each other, helping one another stay on track. ""We have each others' backs,"" said Joey Elluzzi, a Vietnam veteran. Many graduates find the companionship so valuable that they return as volunteers. As of 2008, Stand Down House reported that 93 percent of its eligible residents found work and 84 percent of graduates went on to live independently. Foster and his staff are now working with other programs around the country, sharing what they've learned. Despite his program's success, Foster said, there's more work to do. A new wave of veterans from Iraq and Afghanistan is appearing at Stand Down House, and Foster said he's determined to serve -- and save -- this next generation. When asked why he does this, he simply answers, ""It's my calling.""  Watch Foster talk about his mission to help homeless veterans » . But for those Foster has helped, there's nothing simple about his achievements. ""If you could see the people when they come in here -- how they look, act and smell -- and then see them after, being a positive part of society, I don't know how you couldn't call Roy a hero,"" veteran Keith Coleman said. ""Think of all the lives he's changed."" Want to get involved? Check out Stand Down House and see how to help.","Roy Foster's program helps veterans facing addiction and homelessness .

"Boulder, Colorado (CNN) -- The media have begun to make comparisons between Hurricane Katrina and the earthquake in Haiti. And in some ways, the two events are comparable. Like Katrina, the earthquake has produced effects of catastrophic proportions. Both events rank among the largest catastrophes ever experienced in the Western Hemisphere. They both have resulted in large loss of life and immense human suffering and make the coordination of emergency resources extremely difficult. Ordinary citizens are left to fend for themselves in the wreckage. And as we saw in Katrina and see now in Haiti, residents of disaster-stricken areas are the true first responders. The aftermath of such catastrophes brings more prolonged suffering and massive recovery challenges. People pay attention as the media cover them, but they turn their attention elsewhere when the cameras leave, even though many of the real challenges that victims and affected regions face emerge later. Like the Gulf region, Haiti will struggle for years and perhaps decades to rebuild and recover. But there, the comparisons end. To get an idea of the distinction between the two events, imagine that all of the U.S. west of the Mississippi were to be destroyed or extensively damaged by some immense catastrophe in one minute, with absolutely no warning. That is the situation Haiti faces. As horrific as it was, Katrina was a region-wide catastrophe, not a national one. Damage was enormous in the Gulf region, but the resources of the larger nation remained intact and available for mobilization, even though aid was slow in coming. Katrina did not flatten our nation's capital or prevent national leaders from communicating with one another. Impacts were catastrophic in areas where Katrina struck, creating significant logistics problems, but the infrastructure of the rest of the nation was untouched. Also important, it was possible to issue warnings for Katrina, which enabled the vast majority of those who were at risk to evacuate to safety. The victims of the earthquake had no such warning. In contrast, the earthquake in Haiti destroyed much of its capital, Port-au-Prince, and affected approximately one-third of the population of the entire country. The proportion of the nation's population that has been killed, injured or left homeless is enormous. The facilities that could have assisted victims, such as hospitals, clinics and the UN headquarters for the nation, were destroyed or are not operational. Aftershocks, which will continue for weeks, months and perhaps even years, will do additional damage and further compound both rescue and relief efforts. There is another distinction that makes these events non-comparable. Katrina affected the most vulnerable in the impact region: the poor, the elderly, the disabled, nursing home and hospital patients, and other at-risk groups. But the concept of vulnerability takes on a new meaning in the Haiti earthquake. The entire nation is desperately poor; 80 percent of the population lives in poverty and more than half that number in abject poverty. On almost all indicators of well-being -- health, education, literacy, income -- Haiti ranks very low. The nation has a long history of rule by dictators, political coups and savage violence. The capacity of Haiti's series of governments to provide services to its people has been abysmal for most of its history. In many ways, residents of Haiti faced a daily disaster even before the earthquake. These differences matter, and they should be kept in mind by those seeking to see parallels between the two catastrophes. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Kathleen Tierney.","Haiti quake and Katrina resulted in suffering and death for many .
Though there are parallels, two disasters were very different, Kathleen Tierney says .
She says the Haiti quake came without warning, affected larger proportion of nation .

"With the exception of toilet paper, low-cost airlines have managed to tack a fee on pretty much every formerly complimentary amenity. Checked luggage, of course, was among the first to earn a price tag. U.S. airlines such as Spirit and Frontier are already charging passengers extra for carry-ons. Word has it other airlines will soon follow suit. Airlines sugarcoat these bitter pills with explanations that sound pretty good. ""Spirit Airlines empowers customers to save money on air travel by offering ultra low base fares with a range of optional services, allowing customers the freedom to choose only the extras they value,"" says Spirit Airlines. But c'mon -- who doesn't value a bag? If someone is going by plane, presumably they're going away for at least a night. And presumably they're going to want to put on a new pair of clothes. A fresh pair of underwear, at the very least. To the rescue of those of us sick of paying baggage fees comes Jaktogo, a company with an innovative way to pull one over on ""the man"" -- wearable luggage. ""Only fools pay for extra luggage,"" reads the company's tagline. ""Clever people have a Jaktogo."" What is a Jaktogo, you ask? It's a bag that unfolds into a jacket that's covered in various-sized pockets, allowing travelers to pack everything into their coats. Even their laptop. Adios, luggage fees. There are a few other ""luggage jackets"" on the market -- Stuffa Jacket, Rufus Roo, etc -- but Jaktogo appears to be the leader in capacity. The makers say it's also a handy way to carry things when you've run out of suitcase space. The wearable bags come in a variety of styles and materials like leather and denim. There's a dress version. A poncho, too. Prices range from $90-319. Bear in mind, you're going to have to sacrifice style in the name of savings. The Jaktogo isn't sexy. And we can't imagine they're comfortable. But hey, you already gave up everything else for that cheap flight. Might as well chuck your dignity into the low-cost turbines too.

"Police arrested a suspect early Saturday in the fatal shooting at South Carolina State University.  Justin Bernard Singleton, 19, was charged with Friday's murder of 20-year-old student Brandon Robinson, according to a statement from the South Carolina Law Enforcement Division. The two were arguing when Singleton pulled out a gun and shot Robinson in the neck, police said. After the shooting in Orangeburg County, police initially started a manhunt for a total of four possible suspects. ""He was a very nice young man,"" university President Thomas Elzey said of Robinson, fighting back tears in a brief statement to reporters Friday. ""And it hurts. It hurts us all."" Elzey said ""we are pulling together as a community,"" announcing that counselors would be made available to grieving students. ""Our first order of business is to make sure that our students are safe,"" the school president said. Campus police were called to the Andrew Hugine Suites Living and Learning community about 1:30 p.m. and found the injured student, the university said. Police said eyewitnesses identified four suspects who had left the campus, the university said. The school was initially put on lockdown; those restrictions were lifted a few hours later. Nonetheless, South Carolina State's Facebook page still urged people to ""remain cautious and report any suspicious activity to police."" South Carolina State is a historically black university with about 4,000 students, according to the school website. The campus is about 40 miles south of Columbia. CNN first learned about the incident via Twitter. This is at least the third campus shooting this week. On Tuesday, a man shot and killed another student inside Purdue University's electrical engineering building. Police said Cody Cousins, 23, an engineering student, killed Andrew Bolt, 21, of West Bend, Wisconsin. Cousins was charged with murder. On Monday, a student was shot and critically injured near a gym at Widener University near Philadelphia. Police were looking for a suspect. On Wednesday, the University of Oklahoma in Norman briefly shut down after a report of a possible shooting that apparently turned out to be a false alarm, the university's president said.","The suspect has been charged with murder .

"(CNN) -- Bosnia's constitution violates European human rights law by banning Jews, Roma and other ethnic minorities from running for president or the upper chamber of Parliament, the European Court of Human Rights ruled. Two prominent citizens of Bosnia and Herzegovina -- one Jewish, the other Roma, or Gypsy -- took the former Yugoslav republic to Europe's highest court over the provision. Jakob Finci and Dervo Sejdic ""complained that ... they were prevented by the Constitution ... and the corresponding provisions of the Election Act 2001, from being candidates for the presidency and the House of Peoples of the Parliamentary Assembly solely on the ground of their ethnic origins,"" the court said in its ruling. That ""amounts to discrimination and breaches their electoral rights,"" the court said. A 17-judge panel found in the citizens' favor by a vote of 16-1 on the law banning them from running for president, and 14-3 on the one keeping them from becoming members of the House of Peoples. A human rights group that worked on the case welcomed the verdict. ""By forbidding whole communities the right to participate fully in the country's political process, Bosnia's constitution and electoral law violate fundamental human rights standards,"" said Lucy Claridge, the head of law for Minority Rights Group International. ""The European Court of Human Rights acknowledges this fact today."" It was the first time the court has found a violation under the European Convention's Protocol No. 12, which generally prohibits discrimination, the rights group said. Bosnia and Herzegovina has a recent and bloody history of ethnic violence, suffering years of war in the early 1990s as Yugoslavia tore itself apart. The court acknowledged that the country's constitution was designed to bring that bloodshed to an end. The constitution created a three-member presidency, with one member from each of the country's three main ethnic groups -- Serbs, Croats and ""Bosniaks,"" who are Muslim. The complex structure was intended to reunify two parts of the country that were at war with each other, and to keep any two factions from imposing their will on the third. The constitution distinguishes between Bosnia's ""constituent peoples"" and ""others"" -- those who are not Serb, Croat or Bosniak. ""This system, put in place at a time when a fragile cease-fire had been accepted by all the parties to the inter-ethnic conflict that had deeply affected the country, pursued the legitimate aim of restoring peace,"" the court said of the arrangement negotiated in 1995. But ""the situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina (has) improved considerably since the Dayton Peace Agreement and the adoption of the Constitution,"" the court said. The case is Sejdic and Finci v. Bosnia and Herzegovina (application nos. 27996/06 and 34836/06). The verdict cannot be appealed. The 1992-95 Bosnian conflict was the longest of the wars spawned by the breakup of Yugoslavia in the early 1990s. Backed by the government of then-Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic, Bosnian Serb forces seized control of more than half the country and launched a campaign against the Muslim and Croat populations. Radovan Karadzic, the leader of the Bosnian Serbs at the time, is now on trial at the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia, facing charges of war crimes and genocide. He was removed from power in 1995, when the Dayton Accords that ended the Bosnian war barred anyone accused of war crimes from holding office. Milosevic died in 2006 while on trial before the tribunal.","Bosnia's constitution breaks European human rights law, says court .

"For Ursula Ward, visiting her son's gravesite has become a painful yet inescapable part of her daily routine. ""He touched our lives so much,"" she said. A year ago Father's Day would be the last time they spoke. ""See you later,"" she told him. In the early hours of June 17, 2013, Odin Lloyd was gunned down near a pile of construction waste in an industrial park. He was 27. His body, shot seven times, was found the next afternoon by a jogger. ""My son is saying to me, 'Ma, you know I always love you,' "" Ward said at the cemetery near her home in Dorchester, Massachusetts. ""It doesn't feel like it's been a year,"" Olivia Thibou said of her brother's killing. ""It feels like it was yesterday."" Truth be told, she says, when the suspect in your brother's death remains in the headlines, it makes it even harder to heal. The man whom prosecutors accuse of orchestrating Lloyd's killing, former New England Patriot Aaron Hernandez, remains jailed while waiting to stand trial with two co-defendants. Hernandez, Ernest Wallace and Carlos Ortiz have all pleaded not guilty. Prosecutors say there is security video of Lloyd getting into a car with the three men and driving into the industrial park where Lloyd's body was discovered, about a half-mile from Hernandez's North Attleboro home. Charles Rankin, an attorney for Hernandez, says he is confident his client will be exonerated. Hernandez also pleaded not guilty last month to two additional murder charges. Police say he fired a .38-caliber handgun into a car, gunning down two strangers, Daniel de Abreu and Safiro Furtado, in July 2012 after Abreu accidentally spilled a drink on him. Charges were brought against Hernandez in the double homicide only after evidence discovered during the Lloyd investigation led police to the now-fallen football star, according to court documents. They called him 'O' Unlike de Abreu and Furtado, Lloyd wasn't a stranger to the popular Patriots tight end. For about a year, ""O,"" as Odin was called, dated a sister of Hernandez's fiancee's. Lloyd found himself occasionally partying with Hernandez and getting choice seats at Patriots games.  For Lloyd, an unpaid semipro player for the Boston Bandits and a football fanatic, it was heaven. ""He was just talking about how (Hernandez) was a cool dude and how they talked football,"" said Michael Branch, the Bandits' assistant coach. Yet Lloyd told Branch that the Patriot's lifestyle off the field wasn't what he expected. ""For an NFL guy, he parties a lot,"" Branch recalled Lloyd saying. Branch, who also coached Lloyd in high school, described his former player as a ""loving, caring, clown, loved to have fun."" ""He would light up a room,"" said Branch, who continued mentoring Lloyd for years as he tried college and worked as a utility company lineman and later as a part-time landscaper. Lloyd's two closest friends, Darryl Hodge and Daryl Sweet, knew him better than most. Now, neither will mention Hernandez by name. They say he doesn't deserve to be in the same breath as their friend. At one time, however, Lloyd's friends got a kick out of him crossing paths with one of the Patriots. ""It was a treat,"" said Hodge. ""It started out like a great treat."" They describe ""O"" as laid back and quick to laugh, though they say he didn't let a lot of people into his circle. ""He just wanted to focus on what really mattered.  Life. Family. He was very family-driven. Always took care of his mom and his sisters,"" Sweet said. Hodge and Lloyd became friends in high school. The two and Sweet were Bandits teammates. Lloyd's two friends spent Father's Day with him. No one could have known it would be the last day of Lloyd's life. One of the last things he and Hodge talked about was making a run at careers they could build on. ""Bro, let's actually do this. Let's just not talk it,"" Hodge said the friends told one another before parting.  ""And that was it,"" he continued.  ""I'll see you later."" Branch mourns the young man he knew for more than half of his life. He often thinks about what Lloyd overcame. ""Are there gang factions in his neighborhood? Yes, there are. I'm not going to lie to you. Did those involve Odin? No. So for him to beat those odds, and here, he's murdered in North Attleboro, it just doesn't add up to me still,"" Branch said. Sweet has yet to delete Lloyd's number from his phone. ""I still text his number until the day somebody texts back and says 'this isn't Odin's number.' Hopefully, that day doesn't come,"" Sweet said. 'Win, lose, die or draw -- we lose' Publicly, Lloyd's mother remains silent about the details of her son's death.  But she attends every court appearance accompanied by family and friends. Her son's girlfriend, Shaneah Jenkins, often sits with her and never with her sister Shayanna, who is Hernandez's fiancee. Shayanna Jenkins has been charged with lying to a grand jury about the case, and she has pleaded not guilty. Lloyd's mother prefers to focus on positive memories of her son. A few weeks before he died, she recalls, he dropped by her beauty school and heard her instructor's praise.  ""Your mom is one of the best students in this school,"" Ward remembers her teacher telling Lloyd. ""My son's face lit up, like someone just gave him a million dollars. ... And I can never ever forget that smile. Never."" On Saturday, Lloyd's family is holding a block party not only to thank friends for their support but to raise money for a college scholarship fund in his name, in hopes of allowing someone else to live their dream. No matter what, Hodge predicts, life will never be the same. ""Win, lose, die or draw -- we lose,"" he said. ""At the end of the day, if we get justice, do we really come out a winner? I don't think so. You don't have that life, that voice, that personality. You don't have that.""","It's been one year since Odin Lloyd was killed .

"It's 8 p.m. in Chelsea, Massachusetts, just across the Mystic River from Boston. For Lt. Detective David Betz, his day is about to get busy. After about 30 minutes, Betz, head of the Narcotics and Vice Division of the Chelsea Police Department, leaves to meet with a confidential informant who has been assisting with a case. ""When we make contact with this person, hopefully they will be able to make a call to any number of their sources, and we'll try to buy some heroin off the street tonight. ... This is basically the meat and potatoes of what we do,"" Betz says. Chelsea is in the middle of a heroin epidemic.  In March, Gov. Deval Patrick declared a public health emergency in Massachusetts in response to the growing opioid addiction sweeping the entire state. From 2000 to 2012, the number of unintentional opiate overdoses in Massachusetts increased by 90%, he said. According to the Drug Enforcement Administration, it's happening all across America. The demand for heroin is reaching unprecedented proportions -- fueled in part by a growing number of people who get hooked on prescription painkillers and soon need a cheaper way to get high. Like heroin, the painkillers morphine, methadone, hydrocodone and oxycodone are all opioids and have a similar effect on the nervous system. Heroin, however, is cheaper to get and easier to find. Denver mom survives darkness of addiction . In Chelsea, according to Betz, the majority of illegal prescription pill sales take place behind closed doors, but a heroin deal can be made in the heart of downtown Chelsea, at a busy part of town called Bellingham Square. Betz says in Chelsea, one small dose of heroin runs $10 to $40 depending on size and quality. Prescription opioids, on the other hand, sell for $1 per milligram, or $80 for one 80mg pill. After waiting for the informant to meet with an alleged dealer and make the buy, Betz and several other detectives take the informant into custody. They search the informant to make sure there is no pocketed  heroin or cash, and have the person hand over the drugs. The informant has bought five small bags of heroin. Betz and his team will use the information to build a case against the dealers and secure search warrants and arrest warrants. Informants often work with police to get their own charges reduced. ""For every 10 people we arrest, there's probably 15 or 20 people that are waiting to take over because of the money they could make. It's such a lucrative business, you know. Why would you want to deliver pizza for $8 an hour when you can make $800?"" But Betz says Chelsea is not so different from any other town when it comes to drugs. ""The smallest community in the heartland of America is going to have some type of drug problem,"" he says. ""I mean drugs are, you hate to say, they're as American as apple pie."" Betz describes an artery-like network of distribution and delivery that ensures a steady flow of heroin, prescription narcotics, and other drugs into the country -- eventually working its way into small cities and towns like Chelsea. From Southeast Asia or Mexico, the drugs make it into the United States, Betz says. The drugs are smuggled into New York, then Connecticut and Rhode Island before heading into Massachusetts and the Boston area. From there, it is a short trip across the Tobin Bridge to Chelsea. Betz says small cities often have a tougher battle against drugs than bigger cities because of lower income and resources. ""The more affluent a community, sometimes they're able to keep their problems more under wraps than a city that has somewhat less of population who is well off. It's supply and demand, and if the buyers weren't here, the dealers would have to look elsewhere to sell. It's a double-edged sword. If the dealers weren't here, the buyers wouldn't come around."" What's more, much of the drug problem in Chelsea doesn't come from inside Chelsea, Betz says. He estimates 50% of the city's heroin buyers and dealers come from the bordering cities of Everett, Revere, Winthrop and, of course, Boston. ""When they're arrested, they'll give us their information -- where they are from, where they were born, and just being familiar with the area, we know certain communities are a lot more affluent then say, Chelsea. They come here, and we'll ask them how did you end up here from a suburb of million-dollar homes, and they'll say they got hooked on opiates, they ran out of money, they're not available there like they are here,"" says Betz, ""The easiest way to look at it is, drugs have no borders."" With a department of around 100, Betz and his vice squad try to fight heroin in a city of about 35,080 crammed into 1.8 square miles on the edge of Boston. He is proud of his team's work and believes they make a difference, but he doesn't lose sight of what they're up against. ""I think that drugs as a whole are one of the major problems that are plaguing our society, and aside from all the public intervention that we try to do, the people themselves have to have the will and the desire to want to get past it themselves. If they don't, there's no public service programs or no magic pill to better the problem."" Betz and team have had a relatively successful night making a controlled buy with their informant and gaining information to build a case against suspected heroin dealers. Still, Betz knows that each day is a new day, where the effort to end the heroin problem in Chelsea continues. ""You're trying to keep them from selling the drugs but it's really almost temporary,"" he says, ""You're constantly pushing back the ocean, basically."" Long Island sees exploding heroin use .

"(CNN) -- On a stormy January night in 1992, out in the Pacific Ocean, 29,000 plastic yellow ducks, blue turtles and green frogs fell from a cargo ship and were lost at sea. For the past 21 years, these durable plastic bath toys have been floating around the world, passing the site where the Titanic sank, landing in Japan, Alaska and Hawaii and even spending years frozen in an Arctic ice pack. Originally sealed in a 40-foot steel shipping container, rough seas and huge waves knocked the bath toys overboard, along with several other containers that sank straight to the ocean floor. See also: Is this the age of the super-ports? Some estimates suggest that up to 10,000 containers fall into the ocean every year. The World Shipping Council, whose members represent 90% of the world's container ship capacity, say that figure is grossly exaggerated and estimate that on average no more than 350 containers are lost annually. Due to severe weather and high seas, accidents or incorrect stowage, there are now shipping containers littering the seabed all around the world. Many float on the surface for months, some rupture and release their goods, but most eventually sink to the bottom -- creating deep-sea stepping stones between ports across the globe. Oceanographer and self-confessed beachcomber Curt Ebbesmeyer says, ""Usually container ships lose containers when the ship starts rolling side-to-side at more than a 55-degree-angle. You have to imagine a couple of dozen containers falling overboard together. When they start banging together, it's a very, very violent episode."" Approximately 90% of worldwide cargo travels by sea -- an overwhelming percentage. While often overlooked, shipping containers have transformed global trade, easily moving between truck, train and ship. See also: Introducing the world's biggest ship . Drewry Shipping Consultants, who track container inventories at a microscopic level of detail, say 183 million TEUs (20-foot equivalent units) are moved globally by sea every year and at any one time, approximately 6.7 million containers are in transit. According to Peter Glover, Master Mariner and Senior Associate at international law firm Norton Rose Fulbright, ""There is no international convention which places an obligation on shipping companies to report losses of containers at sea."" However, a report will likely be required if the loss of the container is considered to be a marine accident, presents a danger to navigation, or if discharge of the contents of the container is such that it breaches the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships. In June of this year, a five-year-old container ship, the MOL Comfort broke its back in heavy weather and split apart off the coast of Yemen. There were no casualties but all 7,000 containers, reportedly carrying consumer electronics and clothes, were lost after the ship caught fire and subsequently sank -- a catastrophic event that cost insurers between $300-400 million in claims. Over the years, a great wealth of unusual items has washed up on beaches around the world. In 2006, beachcombers scavenging the Outer Banks of North Carolina were greeted by thousands of sealed bags of Doritos tortilla chips that floated onto the beach, dry and still in an edible condition. During a storm in 1990, a large wave washed 21 shipping containers into the North Pacific Ocean. 60,000 Nike shoes -- en route from Korea to the US -- splashed into the waves. Over the next year, hundreds of shoes -- from hiking boots to children's shoes -- were discovered on the beaches of the Queen Charlotte Islands, western Vancouver Island, Washington and Oregon.

For the last 21 years, Ebbesmeyer has been tracking the ducks, frogs and turtles from Sitka, where they first landed, all the way to Scotland and Maine. Having patiently recorded the date and location of each sighting, he has been able to learn an enormous amount about the ocean's conveyor belt. While Ebbesmeyer says only 3% of findings are reported, the last sighting he is aware of was a frog in August of this year. Today, he believes there are only a few hundred left... still at the mercy of the winds and surface currents. Once the tale of the tub toys is over, Ebbesmeyer says he still has plenty of other container spills to help him track the currents -- 34,000 hockey gloves and 5 million Lego pieces were dropped in the ocean 16 years ago, for example. ""It's a strange thing to be living on a planet and not know what's in 70% of it,"" Ebbesmeyer says. ""You literally never know what's going to wash up onto shore.""

"She wrote of being in love, falling out of love, fearing a marriage to a skirt-chaser and then loving that marriage, and believing in God to hold on to the hope of reuniting with her assassinated husband. Letters that a young Jacqueline Bouvier, and later a married Jackie Kennedy, wrote to a Catholic priest in Ireland offer a rare and revealing glimpse of the private thoughts of one of America's most admired first ladies. An icon of style and elegance, she came to symbolize an administration nicknamed Camelot that ended with the violent death of President John F. Kennedy in November 1963. Over a period from when she first met the Rev. Joseph Leonard on a trip to Ireland in 1950 until he died in 1964, she wrote him more than two dozen letters. She only met him in person once more, in 1955, but the letters being sold at auction in Ireland provide insight into the personal dreams, wishes and fears of a young woman who became one of the world's most popular figures. Revealing letters . Part of her popularity involved the mystique of Jackie Kennedy, the focus of near-rabid media attention who later married Greek shipping magnate Aristotle Onassis. While others sought to chronicle the woman and her life, she provided little help through the years. ""It's so good in a way to write all this down and get it off your chest - because I never do really talk about it with anyone,"" she said in one letter. The correspondence shows the maturation of a high society girl who broke off an engagement with New York stockbroker John Husted before she met the dashing young politician she would marry. ""So terribly much in love -- for the first time -- and I want to get married. And I KNOW I will marry this boy,"" she wrote of Husted. ""I don't have to think and wonder -- as I always have before -- if they are the right one, how we'd get along etc. ... I just KNOW he is and it's the deepest happiest feeling in the world."" Things changed, as she later described to Leonard. ""I'm ashamed that we both went into it so quickly and gaily, but I think the suffering it brought us both for a while afterwards was the best thing  -- we both need something of a shock to make us grow up,"" she wrote. "" I don't know if John has -- I haven't seen him and I don't really want to, not out of meanness -- it's just better if that all dies away & we forget we knew each other -- but I know it's grown me up and it's about time!"" The next time she gets engaged, she added, it will be ""ALL RIGHT and have a happy ending!"" ""His career is the driving thing"" That next time was to Kennedy, the scion of an influential Democratic family from Massachusetts who became the first U.S. president of the televised campaign era. ""If he ever does ask me to marry him, it will be for rather practical reasons - because his career is this driving thing with him,"" Jackie wrote in one letter of Kennedy's political ambitions. A 1952 letter, written the year before they wed, showed her understanding of Kennedy's philandering ways, which continued in the White House. ""He's like my father in a way — loves the chase and is bored with the conquest — and once married needs proof he's still attractive, so flirts with other women and resents you,"" she wrote. ""I saw how that nearly killed Mummy."" She also wondered about the glitzy life she lived, writing that ""maybe I'm just dazzled and picture myself in a glittering world of crowned heads and Men of Destiny-- and not just a sad little housewife."" ""That world can be very glamorous from the outside -- but if you're in it -- and you're lonely -- it could be a Hell,"" she added. ""God will have a bit of explaining to do"" Despite such concerns, she later wrote Leonard that she loved being married to the man she called Jack. After Kennedy's assassination, Jackie wrote of trying to understand it all. ""I think God must have taken Jack to show the world how lost we would be without him -- but that is a strange way of thinking to me,"" she wrote."" God will have a bit of explaining to do to me if I ever see him."" Another passage showed the depth of her grief. ""I have to think there is a God -- or I have no hope of finding Jack again,"" she wrote. Jackie died in 1994. 50 years later, Jackie Kennedy's pink suit locked away from view . The letters to Leonard go up for sale next month at Sheppard's Irish Auction House. In effect, an ""unpublished autobiography"" ""We are thrilled at Sheppard's to offer what is in effect the unpublished autobiography of Jacqueline Bouvier Kennedy,"" said a statement by Philip Sheppard, the auctioneer. He told CNN on Tuesday the letters came from a private source and as a trained historian, he satisfied himself that ""the source who gave the letters is authentic and that the letters are authentic as well."" Jackie was 21 when her correspondence began with the 73-year-old Leonard, and her letters to the priest showed the value she placed on their relationship. In one, she discussed the difference between Leonard and the American priests she knew, complaining they gave her ""a whole lot of trite little phrases that make you angry & resentful and farther away from the church than ever."" By contrast, she wrote, Leonard was ""someone who loves everything I love -- who you can have FUN with -- who can take you to Jammet's & the theatre as naturally as to Mass -- whom you can talk to about anything in the world and know you won't shock them -- and whose whole life is built on love -- love and not fear -- which is what always put me off."" One letter to Leonard ended: ""I REALLY must stop now Father L -- but bushels, barrels carts & lorry loads of love to YOU -- Jacqueline XO.""","Jackie complained about American priests being trite .

"When Susan Patton, a Princeton alumna, advised in an open letter that Princeton coeds find a husband before they graduate, she provoked an avalanche of responses that span the spectrum from ""good idea"" to ""no way."" So, what should young women make of her advice? It turns out that we actually know a lot about the consequences of choosing a mate at an early age. Most of it shows that, on average, delaying marriage confers a number of advantages to women -- and to men as well. Research over the last several decades has repeatedly demonstrated that women who postpone marriage are less likely to divorce, more likely to attain economic stability for themselves and their children, and more likely to express satisfaction with their family and work commitments. Even ""Knot Yet,"" a recent report co-written by the National Marriage Project and concerned with the possible costs of postponing marriage, clearly shows that delayed marriage improves the socioeconomic prospects of women and their families (especially among more privileged groups), reduces the chance of divorce and allows women to attain important life goals. Opinion: If only I'd snagged a Princeton man . It's no mystery why this is the case. Amid our post-industrial, hi-tech economy, it takes longer to gain the personal insights and occupational skills needed to make a successful transition to adulthood. It takes time not just to develop the practical knowledge needed to negotiate a rapidly changing world but also to gain a clear sense of purpose about one's own life and about the kind of person one wishes to have as a life partner. In my own research, young women from diverse backgrounds consistently agreed, in the words of one of my respondents, that ""you need to find out who you are first"" before you are ready to choose a lifelong partner.  This woman was the first member of her family to graduate from college. But whether they were graduates of an elite university or making their way through a community college while holding a full-time job, these young women were keenly aware of the challenges facing today's relationships.  They overwhelmingly hope to create a lasting marriage -- or ""marriage-like relationship"" -- in the long run. But they also believe the best chance of making a marriage work is to first establish their own identity and independence. As another young woman put it, as she discussed her plans to finish college and find a good job before settling down, ""I want to be stable for myself, so I'm not getting married prematurely."" These are just some of the reasons the average age at first marriage has been rising for several decades and now hovers around 27 for women and 29 for men.  Younger generations have concluded, accurately, that their options do not contract after schooling, that they can take time to develop their own identities and make important life commitments, and that it may make sense to wait. If the evidence supporting the option of delayed marriage is so strong, why has a letter urging women to choose a partner early garnered so much attention? Perhaps because, despite the crumbling barriers that have allowed women to enter the halls of once all-male enclaves such as Princeton, so much remains unchanged. Susan Patton never questions the norm that women should ""marry up"" -- and by extension, men should marry ""down"" -- on a variety of dimensions, including education, accomplishment and age. (Nor does she question the assumption that mate choice is universally heterosexual, but that is a topic for another debate.) Yet a thorough gender revolution means questioning such assumptions about how women (and men) select a life partner. Genuine equality means jettisoning assumptions that all women should choose a partner who is older, more professionally accomplished or even more intelligent. The young women I have interviewed are far more likely to stress the importance of such criteria as mutual support, respect and love in a marital partnership. Most of all, decisions about when and whom to marry are deeply personal, and advice that presumes ""one size fits all"" is more likely to trigger unnecessary anxiety than to offer useful help. Instead of telling new generations what choices to make, we should turn our attention to creating the social supports and economic opportunities that will help them forge the more egalitarian relationships, satisfying work careers and work-family balance they desire, regardless of when -- and whether -- they marry.","Susan Patton, a Princeton alumna, advised women to find a husband before they graduate .

"(CNN) -- Oklahoma death row inmate John David Duty was executed Thursday using a drug commonly used to euthanize animals because of a nationwide shortage of the sedative normally employed in Oklahoma's lethal injections. Pentobarbital is an anesthetizing drug widely used to euthanize dogs, cats and other animals. Duty, who was pronounced dead at 6:18 p.m. CT, is believed to be the first condemned inmate to be executed using pentobarbital as part of the three-drug cocktail. Lawyers for Duty, who was sentenced to die for strangling his cellmate with a shoelace, claimed that pentobarbital is risky and unproven in humans. The 10th Circuit Court of Appeals allowed Duty's execution to go forward using pentobarbital in place of sodium thiopental, a short-acting barbiturate that induces unconsciousness. ""According to the record, sodium thiopental is now effectively unobtainable anywhere in the United States, thus requiring Oklahoma and other death-penalty states to revise their lethal injection protocols,"" the court said in an order issued December 14. Hospira, the Illinois-based drug company that is the only domestic manufacturer of sodium thiopental, stopped producing the drug in August 2009 because of a shortage of raw materials, a company spokesman said. The sedative is the first drug in Oklahoma's lethal injection protocol. It is followed by vecuronium bromide, a drug that causes paralysis and stops breathing. The third drug, potassium chloride, stops the heart. Hospira does not support the use of sodium thiopental in executions, a stance it has made known for years. ""Hospira manufactures this product because it improves or saves lives, and the company markets it solely for use as indicated on the product labeling. The drug is not indicated for capital punishment, and Hospira does not support its use in this procedure,"" spokesman Daniel M. Rosenberg said in an e-mail. ""In the spring of 2010, Hospira communicated with departments of corrections in the United States to advise them of our position. We have done this every several years going back to the days when the company was part of Abbott."" The condemned man's lawyers argued that pentobarbital's effectiveness is not proven and said the FDA has not approved its use. A spokesman for the FDA did not immediately respond to an inquiry regarding pentobarbital's status. A search on Drugs@FDA, which lists all drugs approved by the FDA, showed its marketing status as discontinued, which means the drug is no longer being manufactured by the marketer. The decision to use pentobarbital in place of sodium thiopental sparked an outcry from death penalty opponents over its questionable effectiveness. ""It's controversial because no one knows how it's going to work. It's never been used in executions,"" said Richard Dieter, executive director of the anti-capital punishment group, the Death Penalty Information Center. ""It's been used on animals and humans in an anesthetic way, not a killing way. If it doesn't work in that context, we know that the other two drugs are extremely painful, so it's going to be an excruciating process,"" he said. Duty was sentenced to die in 2002 after pleading guilty (against the advice of his lawyers) to premeditated murder for strangling his 22-year-old cellmate, Curtis Wise, with shoelaces. At the time, he was serving three life sentences for rape, robbery and shooting with intent to kill from a 1978 conviction. In a letter to the district attorney and in hearings, Duty said he killed his cellmate in the hopes of obtaining a death sentence. The state sought the death penalty based on several factors, including the heinous nature of the crime and the fact Duty carried it out while in prison. In post-conviction proceedings, however, Duty said he was depressed when he pled guilty and that his depression contributed to the murder and his decision to plead guilty. He also unsuccessfully pursued claims of ineffective counsel. The 10th Circuit Court of Appeals sided with a district court's finding that another Oklahoma death row inmate failed to show ""that the use of pentobarbital in Oklahoma's lethal injection protocol presents a constitutionally unacceptable risk of harm to the inmate,"" according to its December 14 order. The appeals court cited the lower court's findings that, based on testimony from an anesthesiologist, the 5,000-milligram dosage (2,500 milligrams in each arm) would give rise to a ""virtually nil likelihood"" that the inmates would feel the effects of the next two drugs.","John David Duty executed with drug used to euthanize animals because of sedative shortage .

"Ahead of next week's scheduled execution of convicted killer Christopher Sepulvado, the Louisiana Department of Corrections has switched to the same controversial two-drug combination that was used in Ohio this month, the Louisiana department said. ""The reason for the change is that DOC has been unable to procure the drug, pentobarbital, specified in the one-drug protocol,"" DOC spokeswoman Pam Laborde said in a statement. ""The Department will continue to attempt to obtain the drug or drugs necessary for either of the two protocols."" Gary Clements, part of Sepulvado's legal team, said an appeal will be filed Tuesday. Ohio execution points to flaws in lethal injection . ""We're not challenging capital punishment in his case ... just how it's going to be done,"" Clements said. Sepulvado's execution is scheduled for February 5.  He was sentenced to death for killing his 6-year-old stepson in 1992. Like Ohio, Louisiana has been forced to find new drug protocols after European-based manufacturers banned U.S. prisons from using their drugs in executions -- among them, Danish-based Lundbeck, which manufactures pentobarbital. Ohio inmate Dennis McGuire appeared to gasp and convulse for about 10 minutes before he died January 16 by lethal injection using the new combination of drugs -- midazolam, a sedative; and the painkiller hydromorphone -- according to reporters who witnessed the execution. McGuire's family said the execution was ""torture."" Controversial execution in Ohio uses new drug combination . CNN legal analyst Sunny Hostin said McGuire's execution will likely spark debate over whether the use of the drugs constitutes cruel and unusual punishment prohibited by the U.S. Constitution. ""Whenever there's a change in the lethal injection process, clearly it's subject to legal proceedings, and perhaps we will see those,"" Hostin said this month. The change in execution drugs was not a surprise, Clements said. ""We predicted they would have trouble finding pentobarbital, and they would have their backs against the wall and they would be forced to do something drastic,"" Clements said.  ""(The) announcement has proven us correct."" Opinion: End secrecy in lethal injections .","Christopher Sepulvado's execution is scheduled for February 5 .

"Adding to what's becoming a lengthy list of run-ins with the law, New York police arrested actress Amanda Bynes on Thursday night after she allegedly tossed drug paraphernalia out the window of her 36th floor Manhattan apartment. Officers were called to her theater district abode after her building manager reported the 27-year-old star was smoking an ""illegal substance"" in the lobby, Christopher Pisano, a New York police spokesman, said. Bynes had headed back to her apartment by the time police arrived, but she let officers in when they knocked on the door, according to Pisano. Once inside, the officers noticed a bong and other marijuana paraphernalia sitting on the coffee table, which Bynes immediately started to throw out the window. Police have charged her with tampering with physical evidence, reckless endangerment and criminal possession of marijuana, Pisano said.  Bynes was charged with endangerment because the paraphernalia could have hit someone below, he said. The tampering charge is a felony.  The two others are misdemeanors. Bynes, wearing a blonde wig, was seen walking into NYPD's Central Booking from the back of a police van on Thursday evening. Bynes' representatives did not immediately respond to CNN's request for comment. The star of ""Easy A"" and ""Hairspray"" has lived in New York since last fall, having moved there from the Los Angeles area. Bynes has a DUI case pending in Southern California, while a pair of separate hit-and-run incidents against her were dismissed late last year.  Earlier this month, she was sentenced to three years probation for driving on a suspended license.","Bynes has had numerous run-ins with the law in recent years .

"Canada's Alice Munro -- called the ""master of the contemporary short story"" -- won the 2013 Nobel Prize in literature, the Swedish Royal Academy of Sciences announced Thursday. The prize committee compared the 82-year-old author to Anton Chekhov, the 19th century Russian who is considered one of the greatest short story writers in history. She's the first Canadian-based writer to win the literature award. Saul Bellow, who won it in 1976, was born in Quebec but moved to the United States as a child and is regarded as a U.S. author. Munro is the 13th woman to receive the literature prize. ""On behalf of all Canadians,"" Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper said in a tweet, ""congratulations to Alice Munro."" After the prestigious award was announced, the Nobel committee said on Twitter that it hadn't been able to contact Munro and left a phone message to tell her the good news. But The Canadian Press contacted her, and she was quoted as saying the award was ""quite wonderful"" and she was ""terribly surprised."" ""I knew I was in the running, yes, but I never thought I would win,"" she said, according to a Toronto Star story quoting The Canadian Press. Doug Gibson, Munro's publisher, spoke to CNN affiliate CTV and read a statement on the author's behalf. ""I am amazed and very grateful. I am particularly glad that winning this award will please so many Canadians. I'm happy that this will bring more attention to Canadian writing,"" she said, according to Gibson. Nobel Prize in chemistry awarded for work that led to complex computing . 'Our Chekhov' Munro's work long has been likened to Chekhov's. Another acclaimed author, American Cynthia Ozick, has referred to Munro as ""our Chekhov."" The Nobel committee noted that ""some critics consider Munro a Canadian Chekhov."" ""Munro is acclaimed for her finely tuned storytelling, which is characterized by clarity and  psychological realism,"" the committee said. ""Her stories are often  set in small town environments, where the struggle for a socially acceptable existence often results in strained relationships and moral conflicts -- problems that stem from generational  differences and colliding life ambitions. ""Her texts often feature depictions of everyday but decisive events, epiphanies of a kind, that illuminate the surrounding story and let existential  questions appear in a flash of lightning,"" the committee said. The author has won many honors over the years, including the 2009 Man Booker International Prize. ""Alice Munro is mostly known as a short story writer and yet she brings as much depth, wisdom and precision to every story as most novelists bring to a lifetime of novels.  To read Alice Munro is to learn something every time that you never thought of before,"" the Man Booker judging panel said at the time. Lives near her childhood home . Munro, who lives in the southwestern Ontario town of Clinton, was born near there in Wingham, where her father was a fox farmer and her mother was a teacher. She started writing stories in her teen years and studied journalism and English at the University of Western Ontario. Munro took a breather from her studies when she got married in 1951. She and her husband moved to Victoria, British Columbia, and opened a bookstore. She published in various magazines starting in the 1950s. In 1968, she published ""Dance of the Happy Shades,"" a book-length collection of short stories. ""In 1971 she published a collection of stories entitled Lives of Girls and Women, which critics have described as a Bildungsroman,"" or a coming-of-age work, the Royal Academy of Sciences said. Other well-known works include: ""Who Do You Think You Are?"" (1978), ""The Moons of Jupiter"" (1982), ""Runaway"" (2004), ""The View from Castle Rock"" (2006) and ""Too Much Happiness"" (2009). A story in the 2001 collection ""Hateship, Friendship, Courtship, Loveship, Marriage"" was the basis of  the 2006 film ""Away from Her,"" directed by Sarah Polley. Munro gained world renown for writing about everyday people. ""Here we have a world prize being won by someone who writes about housewives in Vancouver, booksellers in Victoria, bean farmers in Huron County and accountants and teachers and librarians -- ordinary Canadian people, and she turns it into magic,"" Gibson said. 'God particle' theorists receive Nobel Prize in physics . 'Dear Life' Munro's most recent short story collection is titled ""Dear Life."" The New Yorker magazine, in an interview with her last year, said it includes ""several narratives in which women in some way shake off the weight of their upbringing and do something unconventional."" She was asked whether it was ""normal for girls from rural Ontario to go to university"" when she did, noting that in her stories, there ""is often a stigma attached to any girl who attracts attention to herself. ... "" ""I was brought up to believe that the worst thing you could do was 'call attention to yourself' or 'think you were smart.' My mother was an exception to this rule and was punished by the early onset of Parkinson's disease. (The rule was for country people, like us, not so much for towners.) I tried to lead an acceptable life and a private life and got by most of the time OK,"" she said. Munro was asked how she came to focus on short stories. ""For years and years I thought that stories were just practice, till I got time to write a novel. Then I found that they were all I could do, and so I faced that. I suppose that my trying to get so much into stories has been a compensation,"" she said. Munro has said in the past that she wanted to stop writing but continued. ""I do stop -- for some strange notion of being 'more normal,' taking things easy. Then some poking idea comes,"" she said. ""This time, I think it's for real."" Last year's literature prize . Last year, Chinese writer Mo Yan received Nobel Prize in literature. Activists interpreted it as a nod to the hungry literary tastes in modern China, which could help spark more freedom. The beloved Chinese author -- whose pen name means ""not talking"" -- has captivated his countrymen by intertwining fantasy and gritty everyday life. Mo plies his trade in a country where running afoul of party lines could lead to censorship. His work packs a punch, but he walks a fine line. He is considered a writer within the system and even has embraced official restrictions on writing. And he's a Communist Party member who holds a vice-chairman spot in the state-sanctioned China Writers Association. Prize history . The Nobel Prize in literature has been awarded 106 times since 1901.  In recent years, Munro has been mentioned as a contender, along with Japanese author Haruki Murakami and U.S. writer Philip Roth. It is almost always awarded to one author and has only been shared four times, which stands in stark contrast to the science Nobels, which two or three scientists often share. The youngest recipient was Rudyard Kipling, who is known for his work ""The Jungle Book."" He was 42 when he received the prize in 1907. The oldest was Doris Lessing, who received it at the age of 88. Incidentally, many think Winston Churchill received the Nobel Peace Prize, but he did not. He was awarded the Nobel Prize in literature in 1953. Swedish industrialist Alfred Nobel created the prizes in 1895 to honor work in physics, chemistry, literature and peace. The first economics prize was awarded in 1969. Nobel medical prize goes to 2 Americans, 1 German . Nobels this week . Two Americans and a German shared this year's Nobel Prize in physiology or medicine Monday. Americans James E. Rothman and Randy W. Schekman, and German Thomas C. Sudhof were honored for discoveries of how the body's cells decide when and where to deliver the molecules they produce. And on Tuesday, two men who predicted the existence of the Higgs boson particle 50 years before its discovery took the prize for physics -- Francois Englert of Belgium and Peter Higgs of the United Kingdom. Higgs and Englert's theories of the elusive particle explained what gives matter its mass and played a key role in completing scientists' understanding of the nature of all matter. On Wednesday, the Nobel Prize in chemistry rewarded three scientists for work leading to the computer programs used today to precisely calculate how very complex molecules and huge chemical reactions work. The Nobel Peace Prize will be announced Friday, followed by the final prize, the award for achievements in economics, on Monday.","She writes about ""ordinary Canadian people"" and ""turns it into magic,"" publisher says .

"(CNN) -- A Kentucky man high on marijuana and drunk on whiskey put his 5-week-old son in the oven Sunday and left him there overnight, police said. The oven door was slightly ajar, and the oven was not turned on. After smoking marijuana at the restaurant where he works as a cook, Larry Long, 33, returned home to share a fifth of whiskey with the baby's mother, Brandy Hatton, McCracken County Sheriff Jon Hayden said in a statement. Hatton had four or five shots and went to bed while Long finished the bottle, Hayden said. At 5:30 the next morning, Hatton awoke to the sound of the baby's cries coming from the oven. He had been in it for several hours, police said. Emergency crews responding to the scene transported the infant to a local hospital, where he was found to be unharmed. The incident was reported to authorities by a psychiatric facility that Long turned to when he learned what he had done, officials said. ""He actually called a mental health crisis line immediately thereafter and told them that he had done this. And they contacted us,"" Hayden said. Police arrested Long and charged him with first degree wanton endangerment. He is being held on bail of $10,000. Long blamed his actions on the marijuana, which he believes was laced with a hallucinatory agent, officials said. Authorities have removed the baby from its mother's care and awarded emergency custody to members of her family.","Baby's mother awoke to sound of 5-week-old's cries coming from oven .

"An expanded Violence Against Women Act won bipartisan approval on Thursday from the U.S. House after Republicans failed to pass their own proposal due to a party split on an issue important to women and minority groups. The measure now goes to President Barack Obama, who said in a statement that it was ""an important step towards making sure no one in America is forced to live in fear."" ""I look forward to signing it into law as soon as it hits my desk,"" Obama said. TIME photos: A portrait of domestic violence . Thursday's votes reflected an emerging political reality in the GOP-led House, with a minority of Republicans joining Democrats to pass legislation that has broad public support, including from increasingly influential demographics such as Hispanic Americans. By a vote of 166-257, the GOP version of the Violence Against Women Act failed to win a majority after almost 90 minutes of debate. The House then voted 286-138 to pass the Senate version, with 87 Republicans joining all 199 Democrats to provide majority support. Originally passed in 1994 and reauthorized since, the act provides support for organizations that serve domestic violence victims. Criminal prosecutions of abusers are generally the responsibility of local authorities, but the act stiffened sentences for stalking under federal law. Supporters credit the act with sharply reducing the number of lives lost to domestic violence over the past two decades. Last year, the House and Senate were unable to compromise on another extension of the act, with Republicans opposing Democratic attempts to specify inclusion of native Americans, undocumented immigrants and lesbian, transgender and bisexual women. Opinion: The plague of violence against women . However, exit polls showed Obama won strong support among women, Latino voters and gay and lesbian voters in the November election that also strengthened the Democratic majority in the Senate and weakened the Republican majority in the House. Republicans then changed their stance and agreed to bring up the measure in the new Congress as long as they could offer their own version. The Republican proposal deleted provisions from the Senate measure that gave tribal authorities jurisdiction to prosecute cases on Indian reservations, specifically targeted discrimination of LGBT victims, and allowed undocumented immigrant survivors of domestic violence to seek legal status. In debate before Thursday's votes, Rep. Kevin Cramer, R-North Dakota, said the Senate version includes legal precedents of expanded sovereignty that could be subject to court challenge. Opinion: Rubio missed the year of the woman . ""Please consider the damage we have done if a court overturns this act and its protection all because we wanted a good slogan instead of a good law,"" Cramer said. House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi of California and others repeatedly questioned why Republicans would seek to weaken a measure that received strong bipartisan support in a 78-22 Senate vote earlier this year. A majority of Senate Republicans backed the act, along with every woman senator regardless of party, Pelosi noted. ""It's really hard to explain why, what eyes the Republicans are looking through, that they do not see the folly of their ways in the legislation they are proposing,"" Pelosi said. Democratic Rep. Gwen Moore of Wisconsin, herself a rape victim, paraphrased the question of rights activist Sojourner Truth, a 19th century escaped slave and civil rights advocate. ""Ain't they women?"" Moore shouted in reference to native American, undocumented immigrant and LGBT women. In response, Republican Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers of Washington challenged Democratic claims that the GOP version excluded any women, saying it was all-inclusive. A global push to end violence with song and dance . House Majority Leader Eric Cantor of Virginia said the goal was to ""make sure all women are safe,"" and he described the Republican version as an attempt to ""improve on"" what the Senate sent over. However, Pelosi noted that hundreds of advocacy groups supported the Senate version as the best way forward. ""This is a remarkable day because we have clarity between the two proposals,"" she said, noting one had support from both parties in the Senate and the president while the other was opposed by ""almost everybody who has anything to do with the issue of violence against women."" The final vote on Thursday followed the same pattern as votes on other legislation at the end of the previous Congress, including the agreement to avoid some impacts of the fiscal cliff. A divide between conservative and more moderate Republicans prevented House GOP leaders from being able to pass their proposed fiscal cliff legislation at the end of the year. Under public pressure ratcheted up by Obama, the House ended up approving a Democratic proposal that raised taxes on the nation's top income earners, a key campaign theme in the November election opposed by the GOP. The measure passed with backing from most or all Democrats and dozens of Republicans. Such a dynamic signals the continuing inability of House Speaker John Boehner to marshal his GOP members on some of the most contentious issues coming up, such as deficit reduction and immigration reform. Boehner risks his standing as a party leader if he continues conceding on measures that become law without majority support from House Republicans, which also would fuel continuing unrest by conservatives who traditionally comprise the GOP base. Domestic violence bill vote critical test of more inclusive GOP . According to advocacy groups, the Senate version of the Violence Against Women Act  approved Tuesday strengthens protections of particular groups of women at particular risk. For example, one in three native women will be raped in their lifetime, according to the Indian Law Resource Center. Three in five will be physically assaulted, and native women also are killed at a rate 10 times the national average, the center said. The National Congress of American Indians addressed the issue in a December 20 letter to Cantor. Beyond vomiting, how to prevent rape . It described situations in which beatings and rapes by non-native men were declined for prosecution at a federal level and returned to a tribal court as a misdemeanor. Federal law currently prohibits tribal courts from imposing a jail sentence of more than a year, so they generally do not prosecute felonies. In many instances, such cases are dismissed altogether and a defendant can walk free until a grand jury indictment can be obtained. ""The federal criminal justice system is simply not equipped to handle local crimes, and this is the primary reason that tribes seek local control over these crimes that are plaguing our communities,"" the letter said. On undocumented immigrants, Human Rights Watch has found that immigrant farm workers are especially at risk for domestic abuse and argued provisions in the Senate bill ""would go some way toward fixing the problem."" Those in the LGBT community are another high-risk group that will be affected by the Violence Against Women Act. They experience violence at the same rate as heterosexuals but are less likely to report it. When they do, many are denied services. About 45% of LGBT victims were turned away when they sought help from a domestic violence shelter and nearly 55% of those who sought protection orders were denied them, according to the National Task Force to End Sexual and Domestic Violence Against Women. Opinion: GOP House's inaction on VAWA shows bigotry . Vice President Joe Biden, who helped spearhead the original Violence Against Women Act in 1994 when he was a U.S. senator, said Thursday that domestic violence dropped by 64% since then. ""I am pleased that this progress will continue, with new tools for cops and prosecutors to hold abusers and rapists accountable, and more support for all victims of these crimes,"" Biden said in a statement.","The measure now goes to President Obama to be signed into law .

"(CNN) -- Monday will deliver a milestone in presidential campaign history, as user-generated video drives a debate. Over 1700 questions have been submitted to YouTube as of Friday. At 7 p.m. ET Monday, the Democratic candidates for president will face questions sent in via YouTube. Then, on September 17, the Republican candidates will participate in the second CNN-YouTube debate. At CNN, a small group led by Senior Vice President David Bohrman and CNN Political Director Sam Feist is looking over the questions. Bohrman and Feist say they are pleased with the quantity -- and the quality -- of the questions coming in.  Watch how the team is going over the questions » . ""It tells you that people want to connect with the candidates and they want to personalize them,"" Feist said, ""and I think that's what this debate does, personalizes the questions, and it personalizes the answers in a way that journalists don't."" Bohrman said there may be some questions that challenge the candidates. ""There's not going to be a foolish, gotcha question because we're not out there to stump,"" Bohrman said. ""We're out there to actually see how people who want to be president think and handle issues and questions and people that are slightly outside of their comfort zones."" ""There are questions that we, the journalists, we, the mainstream media, would never think to ask in the presidential debate,"" Bohrman said. Some, however, are questioning the process. ""If CNN has total editorial control over what videos are shown to the candidates, it's pulling the rug out from under the so-called 'user-generated content' revolution,"" writes Joshua Levy at Techpresident.com. ""This stuff is much less fascinating if a third-party gatekeeper comes in and tells us what is interesting and what is fluff. Instead, YouTube and CNN should let YouTube users decide what the best questions are, and then use those questions in the debate."" (What's your take?

"(CNN) -- When did it become a crime to admit that you -- as a parent -- put yourself first? Sure, supermodel Gisele Bundchen's haters are ready to pounce no matter what the gorgeous, successful, wealthy wife of New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady has to say. But the backlash surrounding her most recent comments about parenting -- how important it is as a mother to take care of yourself -- really got our attention because the issue is a powerful one in today's parenting. ""You know how they say on the plane you have to put the oxygen mask on first and then put it on your child?"" Bundchen told ""The Sunday Times"" in an interview about why she believes motherhood is her most important job. ""So I think it is the same, as a mum, to take care of myself."" ""You can feel a bit guilty,"" she said. ""But if I put my oxygen mask on first, if I'm feeling fulfilled and present and good about myself, then I'm going to be a much more patient, loving, understanding mother and wife. You have to fill your glass so that everyone can drink from it. That's how I feel."" Why are we so quick to pass judgment the minute a mother professes to take time for herself? Is there something wrong with that? Admittedly, I have failed miserably when it comes to putting myself first ever since I became a mother more than eight years ago. Now, though, I see that ""me time"" has a direct correlation not only with my own mental health but my ability to be a good, loving and patient mother. So I say, ""You go girl, Gisele."" I only wish I had the same clarity years ago when my kids were small that she seems to have now. But removing Gisele from the debate, why are we still as a society so quick to roll our eyes and say ""bad mother"" when a mom admits to making herself a priority? ""Of course moms need to take care of themselves first,"" said Cecily Kellogg, a mom of a 7-year-old who writes for Babble.com and hosts a blog at Uppercase Woman. ""I am an individual first, and I happen to be lucky enough to have the job of also being a mom. But yes, self-care is critical."" Kellogg said the Gisele controversy brought to mind a recent article titled ""How American Parenting is Killing the American Marriage,"" about how parenting has almost become a religion in the United States. That, she said, is part of the problem. ""I think motherhood in particular has been elevated by some elements of society to a religion full of zealots."" We are too often told by society that we, as mothers, must be ""the martyr"" and put everyone's needs and desires before our own, said Jennifer Bosse, a mom of two small children and founder of the blog Defining My Happy. ""We are supposed to go without for the sake of our family. It is implied that we have to give up our needs and passions to make room for others,"" she said. ""And unfortunately there are a lot of women who are guilted into believing that this is just the way it is."" But what makes us better parents, said Micky Morrison, a mom of two and founder of BabyWeightTV, is taking time for ourselves. ""It's not selfish. It's as much a gift to our children as it is to ourselves to make ourselves happy."" ""If I'm sad, depressed or not feeling good about myself, (it) reflects on my kids. My daughter can sense when I'm unhappy and then she gets sad,"" said Trina Small, mom of a 4-year-old and founder of the blog The Baby Shopaholic. ""Why shouldn't a mom take time for herself? So many women, like Rebecca Hughes Parker, a mom of three, including 9-year-old twins, and an editor and attorney, admitted learning the ""hard way"" that taking care of one's self does not preclude taking care of the children and being good at a job. In fact, as Hughes Parker says, ""It enhances both things."" ""When I first had my twins and was working full time, I did not make time for myself at all,"" said Hughes Parker, who also has her own blog about parenting. ""I did not see friends, exercise, sleep or eat enough. It led to a back injury."" After physical therapy, yoga and realizing ""more hours does not always mean better work,"" Hughes found herself much more centered when she had her third child six years later. Avital Normal Nathman, editor of the motherhood anthology ""The Good Mother Myth,"" said, ""We can't fully take care of others, if we're not devoting time to ourselves, especially in a world that prescribes so many roles to women in particular -- worker, mother, wife, daughter, caregiver, homemaker, etc."" That said, Norman Nathman and other mothers across the country said that while Gisele and other women of privilege have the means, which could include a ""bevy of help,"" to ensure their ""me time,"" that is not the case for most women today. ""The average woman simply doesn't have the same support in terms of childcare and also lacks the funds for various forms of self-care that Gisele values,"" said Norman Nathman, a mom of a 7-year-old and host of the blog The Mamafesto. ""So, while the sentiment is lovely, the reality is very different for those not making a reported $128,000/day."" Jennifer Alsip, a mom of two girls, ages 18 and 22, said she never took care of herself before her kids. As a single mom on a budget, there were plenty of times when she would forgo buying new clothes for herself, and sometimes eat less when food was scarce, so that her kids could be taken care of. ""I don't think Gisele Bundchen has ever been put in a position of being hungry ... or needing to clothe your kids for school but not having enough money to do it, so she wouldn't know that sacrifice of putting your kids first."" There is no question that hearing the ""put yourself first"" parenting advice from someone who has every resource on the planet to put herself first strikes people as out of touch, but regardless of the source, I still think it gets to a core problem of modern parenting. The debate reminded me of the firestorm of criticism that erupted after author Ayelet Waldman, in a 2005 column for the popular ""Modern Love"" feature in ""The New York Times,"" said she loved her husband more than her children. Can you imagine what the response would have been if Bundchen admitted loving Brady more? What do you think people are so quick to criticize parents who put themselves first? Tell Kelly Wallace on Twitter or CNN Living on Facebook.","Gisele Bundchen was criticized after saying she puts herself first in a recent interview .

"""Downton Abbey"" is wrapping another season chock-full of upstairs, downstairs drama. How will it end? The hit British import completed its third season in the UK last year, but it hasn't stopped a record number of American viewers from tuning in on PBS. The show is in more demand than ever, winning outstanding ensemble in a TV drama series at last month's Screen Actors Guild Awards. With Sunday's finale, there are only 95 minutes left to answer the many questions on viewers' minds. Season three has been filled with startling revelations from the ever-dramatic Crawley family and the employees of their Yorkshire country estate. Show creator Julian Fellowes made sure to pack in the first six episodes with as much plot development as there are characters -- from Mary and Matthew's wedding to the release of Mr. Bates from prison, from the birth of Sybil's first child (immediately followed by poor Sybil's shocking passing) to the financial hardships plaguing Downton. CNN is counting down the top five questions we want answered in the third season's conclusion. PBS' official Masterpiece site promises both the flaring up of new romances and the unfolding of a new crisis on ""Downton Abbey."" Let's make some predictions, shall we? 1. Will Lady Mary finally get her heir? Lady Mary was most recently seen opening up to husband Matthew about a surgery she had to ensure she would no longer have problems in the fertility department. With that sorted out, it's time for the handsome couple to get to work on creating an heir to the Downton kingdom. But with the complications her younger sibling faced during childbirth in the back of her mind, will Mary hold off on having children? All seems well with the newlyweds, and everyone in the Crawley family is awaiting Mary's pregnancy, but nothing is ever as perfect as it appears in this home. 2. Is Tom already moving on from Sybil? The finale takes place more than a year after Sybil's unexpected death, and widower Branson may be moving on to someone new. For viewers, it's only been a few weeks since losing the youngest Crawley daughter, and fans may not be ready for a new woman in Baby Sybbie's life. Tom finally found his place in the Crawley family as he became manager of the Downton estate. But is he getting too comfortable already? Previews for Sunday's episode imply something may be brewing between the chauffeur-turned-gentleman and the new maid. Will Branson give into temptation, or will he remain the consummate gentleman? Either way, quick trysts aren't uncommon within the walls of Downton. 3. Are the karma police coming for Miss O'Brien? The ever-scheming O'Brien spent season three trying to make life a living hell for her former partner in crime, Thomas. Unfortunately for the maid, everything came to a screeching halt by the end of last week's episode. O'Brien believed she had gotten rid of Thomas once and for all after Alfred caught him making unwarranted advances on Jimmy. Thomas won the battle by gaining unexpected support from both Lord Grantham and longtime adversary Bates. The former valet not only retained a position at Downton but actually received a promotion. O'Brien has been known by viewers for her deviant behavior since the start of the series, but she may have finally met her match this season. Thomas recently brought up the infamous ""bath soap incident"" of the first season that caused Lady Grantham's miscarriage. Will we finally see the two come to blows? One can only hope. 4. Will Lady Edith finally get some respect? While Lady Mary was getting hitched and Sybil was getting knocked up, poor Edith was getting left at the altar. Not one to let a man get her down, the ever-resilient middle sister of the Crawley clan went on a quest to find her own voice. Edith defied the outdated expectations of her family by taking on a job writing a newspaper column. As the cherry on top, Edith finally found an exciting gentleman friend in her editor. That is, before she discovers he is already spoken for. Just as Edith finds confidence in her independence and becomes a prime example of 1920s feminism, she is forced to quit to avoid the advances of a married man. Can Fellowes cut Edith some slack already? When will the most jolly nice of all who reside at Downton finally have something go her way? 5. Who dies? A death has been teased since production began on season three, but we're not convinced Sybil will be the only victim before 1921's end. Rumors have surrounded the departure of star Dan Stevens, who plays resident heartthrob Matthew Crawley. That said, there hasn't been anything set up in the first six episodes to insinuate that Matthew might be in any trouble. As any seasoned ""Downton"" viewer knows, no one knows how to execute a great surprise like Fellowes. Let's explore all the possibilities before jumping to any conclusions. This is the current heir to the Downton estate we're talking about, after all. Perhaps one of Thomas' many victims, from O'Brien to Jimmy to Bates, seeks revenge. Could it be Tom joining his beloved wife in the afterlife? His child is certainly in good hands now that Branson has agreed to let Sybbie grow up in the house. Regardless, viewers may need to get their black garb ready and prepare for the demise of a fan favorite. Of course, these aren't the only things on our minds as we emotionally prepare for Sunday's finale. We are still dying to know who the Dowager Countess will sass in this episode and why? And we're still stunned at the choice to bring heedless Cousin Rose back for a second episode. Let's just hope Downton isn't coming down with a case of Cousin Oliver Syndrome, which famously ruined ""The Brady Bunch."" What do you want to see happen on ""Downton Abbey""?

"Give an astronaut on the International Space Station a digital camera and you're bound to end up with some astounding images -- especially if they're flying above North Korea. When the space station passed over East Asia one night recently, a member of NASA's Expedition 38 crew took a series of photographs that show just how off-the-grid the Hermit Kingdom really is. While thriving cities and major roads are seen glowing across South Korea and China, the landscape between the two countries is so dark that it's difficult to tell where the sea ends and North Korea begins. Pyongyang ""appears like a small island,"" says NASA, noting that the light emission from the North Korean capital is equivalent to the smaller towns of its neighbor to the south. The space agency, which turned the images into a timelapse video, says city lights at night are a good indicator of the relative affluence of cities. Looking at the images, it's hardly a surprise that energy use is dramatically different on either side of the 38th parallel. In South Korea, per capita power consumption is 10,162 kilowatt hours while in North Korea the figure is 739 kilowatt hours, according to World Bank data.","Images taken from space at night show North Korea as a black spot .

"Claire Davis, the 17-year-old high school senior shot by a classmate at their Colorado school, died Saturday at the hospital where she was being treated. ""It is with unspeakable sadness that we write and say that Claire has passed away from the gunshot wound she received at Arapahoe High School on December 13,"" her family said in a statement posted on the Facebook account of Littleton Adventist Hospital. ""Although we have lost our precious daughter, we will always be grateful for the indelible journey she took us on over the last 17 years -- we were truly blessed to be Claire's parents. The grace, laughter and light she brought to this world will not be extinguished by her death; to the contrary, it will only get stronger."" Davis was killed after Karl Pierson, 18,  according to police, walked into Arapahoe High School armed with a pump-action shotgun, a machete and a backpack containing three Molotov cocktails, a bandolier of ammunition across his chest. He shot Davis once in the head and fired randomly into school hallways. Police said Pierson was looking for revenge against a librarian, but couldn't find the faculty member and killed himself as a school resource officer closed in. Davis did not know Pierson and was just a random victim, police surmised. She had been in a coma since the shooting. Davis was described as a sweet girl who loved horses and the English boy band One Direction. After friends started a Twitter campaign, the band recorded a 13-second video message and sent it directly to the Davis family, a source close to One Direction told CNN on Thursday. The video shows singer Liam Payne delivering the message as the other four members stand by. The hospital said Davis died at 4:29 p.m. The family's message on Facebook thanked the hospital staff, first responders and law enforcement officers. ""Last week was truly a paradox in that we lost our daughter, yet we witnessed the wonderful love that exists in the world through the tremendous outpouring of support we received,"" the family said. Pierson's parents issued a statement last week. ""We cannot begin to understand why Karl did what he did,"" Barbara and Mark Pierson said. They also offered prayers ""for the entire Arapahoe High School community, as we know your lives are forever changed by this horrific event."" Hundreds of people attended a vigil for Davis last Saturday.

"Madurai, India (CNN) -- Narayanan Krishnan was a bright, young, award-winning chef with a five-star hotel group, short-listed for an elite job in Switzerland. But a quick family visit home before heading to Europe changed everything. ""I saw a very old man eating his own human waste for food,"" Krishnan said. ""It really hurt me so much. I was literally shocked for a second. After that, I started feeding that man and decided this is what I should do the rest of my lifetime."" Krishnan was visiting a temple in the south Indian city of Madurai in 2002 when he saw the man under a bridge. Haunted by the image, Krishnan quit his job within the week and returned home for good, convinced of his new destiny. ""That spark and that inspiration is a driving force still inside me as a flame -- to serve all the mentally ill destitutes and people who cannot take care of themselves,"" Krishnan said. Krishnan founded his nonprofit Akshaya Trust in 2003. Now 29, he has served more than 1.2 million meals -- breakfast, lunch and dinner -- to India's homeless and destitute, mostly elderly people abandoned by their families and often abused. Do you know a hero? Nominations are open for 2010 CNN Heroes . ""Because of the poverty India faces, so many mentally ill people have been ... left uncared [for] on the roadside of the city,"" he said. Krishnan said the name Akshaya is Sanskrit for ""undecaying"" or ""imperishable,"" and was chosen ""to signify [that] human compassion should never decay or perish. ... The spirit of helping others must prevail for ever."" Also, in Hindu mythology, Goddess Annapoorani's ""Akshaya bowl"" fed the hungry endlessly, never depleting its resources. Krishnan's day begins at 4 a.m. He and his team cover nearly 125 miles in a donated van, routinely working in temperatures topping 100 degrees Fahrenheit. He seeks out the homeless under bridges and in the nooks and crannies between the city's temples. The hot meals he delivers are simple, tasty vegetarian fare he personally prepares, packs and often hand-feeds to nearly 400 clients each day. Krishnan carries a comb, scissors and razor and is trained in eight haircut styles that, along with a fresh shave, provide extra dignity to those he serves. He says many of the homeless seldom know their names or origins, and none has the capacity to beg, ask for help or offer thanks. They may be paranoid and hostile because of their conditions, but Krishnan says this only steadies his resolve to offer help. ""The panic, suffering of the human hunger is the driving force of me and my team members of Akshaya,"" he said. ""I get this energy from the people. The food which I cook ... the enjoyment which they get is the energy. I see the soul. I want to save my people."" How to nominate a CNN Hero . The group's operations cost about $327 a day, but sponsored donations only cover 22 days a month. Krishnan subsidizes the shortfall with $88 he receives in monthly rent from a home his grandfather gave him. Krishnan sleeps in Akshaya's modest kitchen with his few co-workers. Since investing his entire savings of $2,500 in 2002, he has taken no salary and subsists with the help of his once-unsupportive parents. ""They had a lot of pain because they had spent a lot on my education,"" he said. ""I asked my mother, 'Please come with me, see what I am doing.' After coming back home, my mother said, 'You feed all those people, the rest of the lifetime I am there, I will feed you.' I'm living for Akshaya. My parents are taking care of me."" For lack of funding, the organization has been forced to halt construction on Akshaya Home, Krishnan's vision of a dormitory where he can provide shelter for the people he helps. Despite the demands and few comforts his lifestyle affords, Krishnan says he's enjoying his life. ""Now I am feeling so comfortable and so happy,"" he says. ""I have a passion, I enjoy my work. I want to live with my people."" Want to get involved?

"Al-Shabaab militants launched an attack Somalia's parliament headquarters Saturday, leaving at least 10 people dead and more than 11 others wounded, witnesses and officials said. Members of the parliament were among those wounded after gunmen loyal to the al Qaeda-affiliated terror group stormed the facility in Mogadishu, according to witnesses and official accounts. Fighters used automatic rifles, heavy machine guns and explosives in an attack that lasted more than three hours, witnesses said. Mohamed Madale, a police spokesman, said security forces later secured the building after the fighters blew themselves up. He said the security forces killed several fighters during the attack. Dahir Mohamed, a police officer who witnessed the attack, said the attackers used a car filled with explosives to get into the parliament building, and killed some of the Somali forces guarding the building on their way in. Smoke and flames could be seen pouring from the building as ambulances pulled up to attend to the wounded lying on the ground. People took cover as security forces moved in, exchanging gunfire with the attackers. Some members of parliament were evacuated from the building. Ali Osman, an ambulance worker at the scene, told CNN that he collected 10 bodies, including those of Somali forces, civil servants and civilians who were caught in the crossfire during the attack. He also said more than 11 others, including members of parliament, also were wounded. A spokesman said on Al-Shabaab's radio network that the group was responsible for the attack. Prime Minister: Attack does not reflect ""true Islamic faith"" In a statement condemning the attack, Somali Prime Minister Abdiweli Sheikh Ahmed said, ""The terrorists have once again shown that they are against all Somalis, by killing our innocent brothers and sisters. These cowardly, despicable actions are not a demonstration of the true Islamic faith."" The U.S. State Department issued a statement condemning the attack. ""We extend our sympathies and condolences to those affected by this heinous act of terrorism,"" deputy spokesperson Marie Harf said in the statement, ""and commend Somali and African Union forces for their swift and courageous response."" ""We continue to stand firmly with the Federal Government of Somalia and the many international partners working to support its efforts to root out the threat posed by al-Shabaab and to build a more secure and prosperous future for the Somali people,"" Harf said. ""Cowardly acts such as these will not shake our resolve."" Lawmakers witness carnage . Mohamed Omar, a lawmaker who was inside the parliament building, said that Al-Shabaab fighters wore military uniforms and ""suicide belts."" Security forces killed at least three of the militants, Omar said. Osman Daallo, a member of parliament, said he saw two colleagues seriously wounded, including a fellow MP ""whose chest was gushing out from blood."" Mohamed Deyfalah, another MP, said the attack was the worst he has ever witnessed, and he had always believed the heavy security presence at the parliament would have prevented such an attack. One of wounded MPs who asked to remain anonymous said the attack ""indicates the weakness of the government."" ""Our government is still unable to deal with the terrorists and today's attack underscores a lack of efficient government,"" the lawmaker said. Late Saturday, Somalia's security minister, Abdukarim Hussein Guled, resigned as a result of the attack. ""I bear witness that the 22 months I have been in the office, we managed to improve the security situation of the country, especially Mogadishu,"" the minister said, ""but now it is time to resign so that someone else who is better than me can take over the office."" Al-Shabaab's aim is to turn Somalia into a fundamentalist Islamic state, though it has carried out attacks in other African countries, as well. The group carried out the mall attack in Nairobi, Kenya, in September that left at least 67 people dead. The group has increased the use of suicide attacks in recent years, though these have been somewhat rare in Somalia. It is believed that veterans of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan are helping train al-Shabaab fighters. Learn more about Al-Shabaab .","Somali security minister resigns in wake of the attacks .

"(CNN) -- ""I only really have one really major regret,"" Whoopi Goldberg tells CNN's Piers Morgan. ""And it was I had the opportunity to spend a birthday with Sammy Davis Jr., and I didn't."" The actress and co-host of ""The View"" is a guest on Wednesday's ""Piers Morgan Tonight."" Goldberg said she didn't have an exact reason, other than to lament, ""I was young and dumb and -- and he passed like a couple of weeks later. And it devastated me because I thought; you know what, that's what you get. ""I just remember that he had been so good to me. And we were really, you know, good friends. And I -- I should have gone."" She also called Davis an ""amazing performer"" who could ""do everything."" Morgan asked Goldberg whether Davis was the ""greatest all-around entertainer that we've seen."" ""There are maybe three or four, in my lifetime, that were extraordinary dancers and singers and actors and performers,"" she said. She mentioned Judy Garland, Frank Sinatra and Michael Jackson. The actress also talked about her well-known fear of flying. ""I feel like I shouldn't be flying,"" said Goldberg. ""I should be rolling in my bus."" She said her fear was instilled nearly 30 years ago when she witnessed a mid-air collision while standing on a balcony in San Diego. The actress said that what frightened her so much was that ""the people on the plane were aware that they were in some danger."" She said she particularly fears for people ""who see something that they're not sure they're going to be able to live through."" ""And so I -- I just -- I -- that's what stayed in my mind,"" Goldberg said. ""Because I'm a visualist. So if I see it, it lives in my brain. So I always see it."" She said her fears were somewhat alleviated by a course offered by Virgin Atlantic that helps individuals work through issues surrounding fear of flying. For decades, Goldberg traveled back and forth from New York to Los Angeles via private bus. With two drivers, she was able to arrive on the other coast in 23 hours. ""Some people are meant to fly. And I don't know if I was meant to fly, but I do it now."" Goldberg has no choice but to fly in the near future -- she is producing a stage version of her 1992 hit movie ""Sister Act."" It premieres on Broadway on April 20 and is set to open soon in Vienna, Austria; Hamburg, Germany; and London. Another one of Goldberg's quirks is her self-proclaimed refusal to eat ""anything that could be hiding something."" She said she doesn't ""like anything that has a weird consistency."" For example? ""Creamed corn. I don't understand the point. ""I don't understand sauce, because you could hide stuff in sauce. Like, I like my food naked."" Morgan brought up relationships and Goldberg's three marriages. ""The first one lasted six years,"" said Morgan. ""The second one lasted two years. And the last one lasted a year."" Goldberg responded by saying ""I suppose that, you know, you have to actually be in love with the person that you marry. You have to really be committed to them. And I'm just -- I don't have that commitment. I'm committed to my family, you know, and so -- hence, for that relationship has lasted, you know, the longest."" Goldberg admitted that she wasn't in love with her husbands and that she married them because she ""wanted to feel normal. And it seemed to me that if I was married, I'd have a much normal -- more normal life. But clearly, that's not the case. There's not a good reason to get married. You have to actually want a life with someone through ups and downs. And I -- I just discovered that wasn't for me."" She said has been in love only once but would not elaborate other than to say that it was with a man. He's not famous, she's still in close contact with him, but they are just friends -- he's married and had a family with another woman, she said. When Morgan expressed his sorrow over the fact that it never worked out, Goldberg said ""lots of other things did. So I didn't do too badly."" Goldberg was asked about the recent ""Newsweek"" magazine report that said she was the most popular host of ""The View,"" and she's more well-liked than Oprah. ""Well, I -- you know, I mean I'm thankful,"" said Goldberg. ""I'm grateful. But I don't know really what it means."" So is Goldberg a ""voice of America in the morning?"" ""I don't think of myself as the voice of America, but I do think that sometimes I see things from a different perspective, sometimes because of my race, sometimes because of my gender, sometimes because of my experiences.""

"On both sides of the U.S.-Mexico border, key questions are lingering after Mexico's presidential vote. Election authorities projected Enrique Peña Nieto of the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, as the winner Sunday night. But his closest competitor, Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador of the Democratic Revolution Party, or PRD, has not conceded. The election results raise issues rooted in Mexico's complicated political past that will play a critical role in shaping the nation's future, analysts say. Has the PRI, a political party that critics accuse of being authoritarian and corrupt, changed its approach in Mexico? Will Lopez Obrador and his supporters protest the election results as they have in the past? And will Peña Nieto's proposal to decrease violence mark a significant shift in U.S.-Mexico drug war policy? Mexico's old guard is back . On the local level, there may not be many differences between today's PRI and the political party that dominated Mexico for decades, said Andrew Selee, director of the Mexico Institute at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars. ""What's changed on the national stage is that Mexican citizens have different expectations for their federal government that are going to force the PRI to govern in a different way than it did 20 years ago,"" Selee said. ""Then, the PRI was really a party that included all of Mexico, that had a broad patronage network and tolerated little dissent outside of the party. And the PRI today is going to have to deal with opposition parties that have tasted power, an active citizenry that expects to be involved in major policies decisions and a very vigilant press that will report on everything that happens."" Sunday's election was closer than many expected, Selee said, and Peña Nieto and PRI party leaders realize they secured a narrow victory. ""I get the sense the PRI recognizes that they are going to have to build broader coalitions in order to govern effectively,"" he said. Only time will tell, said Jorge Chabat, a professor at Mexico's Center for Research and Teaching in Economics. ""The truth is that we don't know very well who the PRI is now,"" he said. And it's unclear how influential leaders from the party's old guard -- some of whom have close ties with Peña Nieto -- will be, he said. In the past, presidential candidates have said one thing on the campaign trail, then done something else in office. ""We don't really know how he is going to behave. ... Now we are going to see, who is Peña Nieto, truly?"" Chabat said. U.S. Rep. Henry Cuellar, a Democrat from the border city of Laredo, Texas, said the answer is clear. ""He is different. He is a young, outgoing personality,"" said Cuellar, who describes Peña Nieto as a friend and flew to Mexico City over the weekend to support the candidate. ""He's from a young, new generation. He'll bring a lot of fresh, new ideas."" An 'explosive' mixture? Critics of the 45-year-old former governor aren't convinced. Weeks before Sunday's vote, criticisms of Peña Nieto and concerns about the PRI's possible return to power fueled a student movement that has staged demonstrations throughout the country. ""There's a lot of angry voters. The question mark is, what are they going to do?"" said Ana Maria Salazar, a security analyst and former Pentagon official who lives in Mexico City. In 2006, Lopez Obrador's supporters protested nationwide after election authorities said he narrowly lost to Felipe Calderon in presidential elections. How will PRI's win change the U.S.-Mexico relationship? Lopez Obrador claimed election fraud and never conceded, referring to himself as ""the legitimate president of Mexico."" In Mexico City, his followers staged massive sit-ins and blockades. It's unclear, Salazar said, whether protesters will take a similar approach this time around, or try something more severe. ""In a country like Mexico, where we already have a high incidence of violence due to organized crime, add to that social unrest, and it could be an explosive mixture,"" she said. ""I certainly hope not, but we will soon find out."" The Mexico Institute's Selee said Lopez Obrador's reaction Sunday night signaled that any protests this year are likely to be less intense. The former Mexico City mayor was measured In response to the results of Sunday night's quick count, which placed him at least 6 percentage points behind Peña Nieto. Rather than relying on the quick count, which is based on samples from polls nationwide, Lopez Obrador said he would wait for results from the final official vote tally, which begins Wednesday. ""We are going to have all the information and at that time we will establish a position,"" he said. After the 2006 vote, which gave Calderon a narrow victory margin of less than 1%, Lopez Obrador was quick to declare fraud. The difference in reaction is significant, Selee said Monday. ""The fact that Lopez Obrador did not call for mobilization last night means that he's already tipped his hand to accepting the results when they come out. He essentially demobilized his supporters,"" Selee said. A different drug war approach? Beyond Mexico's borders, part of Peña Nieto's campaign platform has been a focal point for U.S. officials and lawmakers: Peña Nieto's pledge to focus more on reducing violence and less on catching cartel leaders and blocking drugs from reaching the United States. ""I am convinced that in terms of security, we need to adjust the policy to keep confronting organized crime, criminal gangs and cartel chiefs head-on,"" Peña Nieto told CNN en Español Monday. ""But we also have to search for a strategy, a reduction of violence in this country. ... The strategy we follow in the short term clear signs of better effectiveness and a reduction in crime rates."" Announcing a crackdown on cartels and sending troops into the streets to help fight the battle were among the first major moves by Calderon after he took office in December 2006. And for nearly six years, a brutal drug war in Mexico with a staggering death toll of more than 47,500 people has dominated discussions between the United States and Mexico. Some political opponents of Pena Nieto, whose party governed Mexico for more than 70 years until 2000, have warned that negotiating with drug cartels and gangs could be on his agenda -- an accusation that Peña Nieto has repeatedly denied. But his denials haven't squelched speculation on both sides of the border that negotiating with cartels -- or at least easing the pressure on them -- could be on the table. In a congressional hearing last month, U.S. Rep. Jim Sensenbrenner said the war on drugs was nearing a ""potential crossroad,"" referring to Peña Nieto's plan and his party's political history. ""While in power, the PRI minimized violence by turning a blind eye to the cartels,"" the Wisconsin Republican said, noting that Peña Nieto ""does not emphasize stopping drug shipments or capturing kingpins."" In a statement the next day, Peña Nieto's campaign said he was committed to combating organized crime. ""The law is applied; it is never negotiated,"" the statement said. Cuellar, the Texas congressman, said this week that such concerns from Sensenbrenner and other lawmakers were unfounded. Changing strategies in dealing with drug violence, Cuellar said, doesn't mean stopping the battle. ""I asked him about it. ... He told me, 'I'm gonna fight it. I want to use a different strategy,' "" Cuellar said, noting that relations between the United States and Mexico would likely strengthen under Peña Nieto's leadership. Pledges to change tack in the drug war were common across party lines on the presidential campaign trail this year, Chabat said. ""In the end, I don't think he will do many things differently than Calderon, because there isn't much that can be done differently,"" Chabat said. ""There's not a lot of room to work. In speeches, it sounds really great to say that you're going to do things differently, but there won't be many changes.""

"A federal civil complaint in Texas claims the defendants may have falsified prescriptions, lied to pharmacies and perhaps even broken the law, but they're not drug runners. They're officials from the Texas Department of Criminal Justice, responsible for executing death row inmates. The complaint, filed in October, is one example of the lengths death-penalty states are willing to go to acquire drugs for lethal injections. Texas, which declined to comment on the pending case, is among 32 death-penalty states scrambling to find new drug protocols after European-based manufacturers banned U.S. prisons from using their drugs in executions -- among them, Danish-based Lundbeck, which manufactures pentobarbital. ""The states are scrambling to find the drugs,"" says Richard Dieter, executive director of the Washington-based Death Penalty Information Center.  ""They want to carry out these executions that they have scheduled, but they don't have the drugs and they're changing and trying new procedures never used before in the history of executions."" States have been forced to try new drug combinations or go to loosely regulated compounding pharmacies that manufacturer variations of the drugs banned by the larger companies. The suit against Texas alleges the state corrections department falsified a prescription for pentobarbital, including the patient name as ""James Jones,"" the warden of the Huntsville Unit ""where executions take place,"" according to court documents.  Additionally, the drugs were to be sent to ""Huntsville Unit Hospital,"" which, the documents say, ""has not existed since 1983."" The suit said the pharmacy was unaware of the purpose for the order and when it found out it canceled the order before it was filled. In a letter obtained by CNN, dated October 4 of this year, Woodlands Compounding Pharmacy, which was requested to provide drugs to Texas officials says it believed its ""information would be kept on the 'down low'"" by the TDCJ."" The plaintiffs also allege the state did not produce a purchase order, instead using an individual employee's credit card to make the purchase. The pharmacy is asking the TDCJ to return the drugs it sold the state. It is unclear whether they have. Maurie Levin, one of the attorneys representing the inmates, said, ""We believe that TDCJ's purchase of compounded pentobarbital from Woodlands Pharmacy violates numerous state laws. The vast majority of compounded drugs can only be mixed or sold pursuant to a doctor's prescription. TDCJ did not get a prescription for its purchase of compounded drugs. There are exceptions to the requirement, but TDCJ's purchase does not qualify for any of them."" In September, Texas even turned to another state, Virginia, for a supply of Nembutal, according to documents provided to CNN by Berkeley Law staff attorney Jen Moreno. Death row inmates say using untested drugs is ""cruel and unusual punishment,"" and several have filed federal lawsuits to delay executions until drug protocols have been reviewed. Ohio was set to execute Ron Phillips on Thursday using a two-drug cocktail never before used in an execution. Ohio's Department of Rehabilitation and Correction said it ""was unable to obtain a sufficient quantity of pentobarbital."" Instead it was set to use the sedative midazolam and pain-killer hydromorphone in a lethal dosage. Ohio Gov. John Kasich stayed Phillips' execution this week pending a review of possible organ donation to his family members. Missouri was set to use propofol, the infamous drug from the Michael Jackson case, in an execution last month, but the governor halted it after he was warned the European Union might halt shipments of the drug, leading to shortages for medical purposes. Deborah Denno, a law professor at Fordham University, said a new combination of drugs used in the execution of Florida inmate William Happ last month took 14 minutes to kill him instead of the usual seven. ""There is absolute chaos among the states,"" Denno said. ""So, every few months it seems we see a different state using a different type of drug, or types of drugs."" Jim Petro, the Republican former attorney general of Ohio, presided over 19 executions but no longer supports the death penalty. ""An attorney general is bound to follow the statute,"" he said. ""Duty is duty."" Dieter said using untested drugs amounts to experimentation on human beings: ""They're guilty people who did these crimes, but that doesn't ameliorate our ethical obligations.""","Civil suit claims Texas falsified prescriptions to acquire drugs for lethal injections .

"I was diagnosed with diabetes 12 years ago. At the time, I was caring for my mother, who was on dialysis and had had her leg amputated. As a family, we knew very little about diabetes -- only that once you got it, you deteriorated and died. Like our father, who suffered a stroke and then died years later of a massive heart attack brought on by complications of diabetes. Both my parents, in fact, died from complications of diabetes. They were strong pillars of our family and community, taken way too soon by a disease that is the leading cause of death among Pacific Islanders. Before seeing the doctor, I had been experiencing extreme thirst, especially at night. The tips of my toes felt like bees lived there and were desperate to burst out of my skin. My vision became blurred after each meal. It was 2 p.m. and I hadn't eaten anything when the doctor tested my blood sugar level. It was in the high 200s. Normal is between 110 and 125. You have diabetes, Ms. Figiel, the doctor said. He prescribed metformin and directed me to a dietitian. She further reiterated what the doctor had told me: how food was related to high blood glucose levels and how consistently high blood glucose levels will eventually lead to amputations, blindness, kidney failure, stroke and other complications. Fit Nation: Why I gave up soda . I followed the dietician's plan for the next few months. I took up walking and noticed that my vision had become clearer. But it didn't take me long to fall back to my old eating habits. A colleague's birthday celebration, a brother's graduation party, a friend's wedding, a cousin's funeral -- these were all occasions where food was at the center. And in our culture, you show appreciation and respect for those who prepared the food by eating it. I soon found myself hovering around 400 pounds. After six years of oral medication, I was switched to insulin injections. My blood sugar levels were too high, and I was not managing them well. Insulin was scary at first. But then I realized it gave me the freedom to eat all my favorite foods! I would just inject 100 units, and my blood sugar would be normal in a matter of minutes. Soon, I was injecting as much as 300 units of insulin a day. It was at this time that I began experiencing extreme pain in my teeth and gums. One of my front teeth became longer than the rest, and I found that I couldn't bite into certain foods, such as apples. This front tooth was eventually pulled. The dentist didn't have to do much; it pretty much fell out on its own. Injecting large amounts of insulin meant I was prone to low blood sugar. I would wake up in a sweat as energy quickly left my body. My 8-year-old son saved my life continuously during this time; he knew exactly what to do and how to inject insulin. The fact that my life was being saved by a child shamed me. Eighteen months ago, my sister and I moved our family from American Samoa to Utah. I saw the move as an opportunity for me not only to change my own life but, most important, to give my son his childhood. Fit Nation: Celebrate small victories . The first thing we did as a family was to enroll at a recreation center. We were all exercising together. The kids had fun in the pool, and I found myself walking again. I also decided to educate myself about diabetes. I had read about people reversing diabetes by eating a plant-based diet. It was an easy plan to follow because I love fruit and vegetables, and they are in abundance here. Yet I found that I couldn't chew much without feeling extreme pain. I bought a Vitamix blender and started throwing all my vegetables and fruits into it. By Christmas, I had dropped 80 pounds. Then, three days before Christmas, my dentist told me that I had advanced periodontal disease and all my teeth had to be removed. Not effectively controlling my diabetes had proven too much for my gums. I was actually relieved. I welcomed anything to remove the pain I was experiencing. I decided to ask my friends to film the surgery. The filmmaker kept asking me, ""Girl, are you sure about this? Aren't you afraid people are going to talk about you?"" You can watch the film on YouTube. It's called ""Sia at the Dentist."" Since then, my son hasn't had to worry about waking up at 3 or 4 a.m. to revive me. In fact, since I began training for the Nautica Malibu Triathlon three weeks ago, we are all sleeping soundly through the night. With the demands of training, I realize that my body needs more fuel. While I enjoy green smoothies, I also need protein and carbohydrates. Our choice of animal protein comes from turkey, salmon, chicken, canned tuna and eggs. I buy whole-grain pasta, quinoa and brown rice. We eat only wheat bread and do not eat white flour or sugar. My boys love saimin, a form of ramen noodles popular on the islands. When I make it now, I add broccoli, peas and green onions and throw out the spice packet, which contains a ton of sodium. They complain and ask, ""Then what's the use of eating saimin?"" That's when I show them my dentures, and there's sudden silence. I still don't know all the answers to diabetes and obesity. All I know is that we have to look hard at our reasons for change. I'll be damned if I lose any other body part to this disease. Did I mention that I ran my first mile this morning nonstop?

"Austin, Texas (CNN) -- In February 2009, Sam Bassett got called to Gov. Rick Perry's office. Bassett was then chairman of the Texas Forensic Science Commission, an agency set up in 2005 to regulate state crime labs after a series of embarrassing scandals. The first matter on its plate involved the 2004 execution of Cameron Todd Willingham, whose murder conviction rested largely on testimony that many arson experts now call outdated and incorrect. Aides to Perry, who allowed Willingham's execution to go forward, started off with general questions about how things were going at the commission, a relatively new agency, Bassett said. But then they started asking about Willingham, questioning whether the commission's review of the evidence in his case was beyond its legal powers. ""As soon as we started discussing the Willingham investigation, the meeting got more confrontational and more difficult,"" Bassett said. About six months later, Bassett's term on the commission was up -- and despite letters from members urging his reappointment, Perry replaced him and three other appointees. The move came at what Bassett calls a ""critical point,"" two days before the commission was to hear from an expert who had delivered a scathing report on the Willingham case. The governor's new pick for chairman soon put the brakes on the investigation, raising some of the same questions about the commission's authority that Bassett said Perry's aides had. And in July, with Perry gearing up for a run for president, the state's attorney general delivered an opinion that appears to sharply limit the commission's authority. The Forensic Science Commission is meeting Thursday to decide what it can still do in light of that opinion. For Bassett, an Austin defense lawyer, it's the culmination of what he now calls a methodical campaign to shut down an investigation that might embarrass Perry. ""At first, when I was replaced, I gave the governor the benefit of the doubt,"" he said. ""But now that time has passed, I've seen this kind of endless drumbeat of strategies and actions to stop this investigation, and it's been terribly disappointing."" Perry's campaign dismissed Bassett's accusations Wednesday, repeating the governor's characterization of Willingham as a ""monster"" who had sent his three young daughters to a fiery death. ""The case has been scrutinized and reviewed by a jury, state and federal courts, the news media, anti-death penalty activists and the Forensic Science Commission,"" Perry spokesman Mark Miner told CNN in an e-mail. ""Willingham was guilty of murdering his children."" The statement did not directly address Bassett's accusations. Bassett's role in the matter ended in October 2009. He said Perry's office called him just days before the commission was slated to hear from the expert it hired to review the evidence in the Willingham case. He said a Perry aide thanked him for his service, but told him Perry ""wants to take the commission in a different direction."" Though the shakeup was controversial at the time, it was barely mentioned in Perry's 2010 re-election campaign. Perry is now seeking the Republican nomination for president, and Bassett says the Willingham case is a window into Perry's leadership. ""He's not always open to any contradictory viewpoints that could actually be helpful,"" said Bassett, who describes himself as a Democratic-leaning supporter of capital punishment in some cases. When the Willingham last-minute plea for a stay came before him, ""There was nobody at the helm to raise a flag and tell him, 'This is serious ... this guy may have been convicted on faulty science,' "" Bassett said. Bassett said July's opinion from Texas Attorney General Greg Abbott ""provides Governor Perry with the cover he probably needs to totally squash the investigation."" Representatives of the attorney general's office raised no concerns about the Forensic Science Commission's jurisdiction when the panel voted unanimously to take on the Willingham investigation, he said. The Corsicana man was put to death in February 2004. It was one of 234 executions Perry has overseen as the longest-serving U.S. governor and the head of the most death-penalty-friendly state. Authorities in Corsicana say they remain convinced of Willingham's guilt, arguing that other evidence beyond the now-challenged arson testimony supported his conviction. The state fire marshal's office has told the Forensic Science Commission it stands by the findings in his case. Bassett said the commission was never looking into whether Willingham was innocent -- but he said much of the evidence cited in his trial is now considered ""junk science."" Perry's campaign also noted that Willingham's ex-wife now believes in his guilt. And his state office told CNN that Willingham ""had full access to every level of the appeals process, and his conviction was consistently upheld."" ""His conviction was reviewed and upheld by multiple levels of state and federal courts, including nine federal courts -- four times by the U.S. Supreme Court alone over the course of more than a decade,"" deputy press secretary Lucy Nashed said in a written response to questions by CNN. In Willingham's case, Perry's office says the governor was briefed on a last-minute filing by Austin-based fire science expert Gerald Hurst that found the deadly blaze was likely not arson, but he refused to grant a stay of execution for further investigation. Nashed told CNN that Hurst's review of investigators' findings in the Willingham fire was also reviewed by appeals courts and the state Board of Pardons and Paroles, which rebuffed a plea for clemency. State and federal appeals courts ""agreed that the new opinion by Gerald Hurst was simply an opinion and did not merit reopening the case,"" she wrote. Two subsequent reviews have backed up Hurst's conclusions, finding that advances in the science of arson investigation since Willingham's trial rendered obsolete most of the signs that fire marshals pointed to as evidence of arson in the case. In the 1990s, researchers determined that several of the things cited in Willingham's trial were likely to be produced in fully involved accidental fires. The appearance of spider web-like cracks in panes of glass, once believed to have been the result of fires started with flammable liquids, turned out to be caused by the rapid cooling of windows sprayed with water. Experiments conducted during that period showed burn patterns once thought to show multiple points of origin -- another possible indicator of arson -- also appear when the intense heat of even an accidental blaze radiates downward and sets items like furniture and carpet afire. The most recent review was conducted by Maryland arson expert Craig Beyler at the request of the Forensic Science Commission. Beyler, then chairman of the International Association of Fire Safety Science, sharply criticized the testimony against Willingham and questioned whether it met even the standards of the day. Beyler ultimately appeared before the commission in January 2011, 15 months after he had been scheduled to answer questions about his report. The commission began looking into Willingham's conviction at the request of Willingham's family and The Innocence Project, which works on behalf of inmates it believes are wrongly convicted. The group has blasted Perry over his role in the issue, accusing him of trying to shut down the probe. Stephen Saloom, the group's policy director, told CNN that the investigation should go forward for the sake of hundreds of other prisoners now serving time for arson, some of whom also may have been convicted based on outdated fire science. ""The Willingham case really demonstrates how severe the consequences can be when you use bad forensic evidence,"" Saloom said.","The former chairman of a state commission criticizes Gov.

"Using game theory and data analytics, a group of political scientists predicted Egypt's current turmoil back in 2011 as the Mubarak regime was falling, and is now working to forecast the country's future. In November 2011, a few months after Hosni Mubarak had been ousted by the Egyptian revolution, the scientists predicted that in the final evolution of Egypt's transitional democratic phase, the military would allow for semi-free elections but would still act as custodians of the country and the true center of power in the short to medium term. ""But as we predicted, when any opposition party comes into power, they only have a year or so to deliver their promises -- and most of the time they can't. And that's what led us to where we are today,"" said Mark Abdollahian, a political scientist and co-creator of Senturion, a large-data predictive analysis model that's used by the U.S. State Department and other governments in predicting, preventing and stopping cycles of violence. Egyptians to take to streets again . Abdollahian's team used complex computer algorithm logic games, that measure how people interact with one another, to draw different scenarios of how segments of Egyptian society, power brokers, religious sectors and other sociopolitical variables would affect the outcome of the transition. Abdollahian's report also concluded that ""the military will act as a safety net against rising anti-Israeli and anti-American sentiment and ultimately the military and intelligence apparatus will act against extremism that may emerge in the democratic process."" ""At that time with societal pressure, Egyptians protesting on the streets and calling for change, the Muslim Brotherhood and Mohammed Morsy were the best credible alternatives to Mubarak,"" Abdollahian said. ""In November 2011, what we showed was even though the majority of the Egyptian society was in favor of ousting Hosni Mubarak, the Egyptian military was at the time going to support the newly elected regime, but not fully accept it for a long-term solution."" Using what he calls ""mapping and tracking,"" Abdollahian and his team studied political, religious and civil society elements and the influence of international, regional and Egyptian groups to form their analysis. ""We mapped who are the stakeholders, their interests on the political issues and what they are going to do with Mubarak. And once we did that, using game theory, we get a good map to track,"" a method Abdollahian and his team continue to use in forecasting what's next for Egypt. When a coup is not called a coup . Morsy's departure a 'reset' for constitution, government . According to Abdollahian's new report, set to be released within the next few days, there will be acceleration to a presidential election and the change of constitution, where most likely Mohamed ElBaradei will emerge as the top presidential contender. ElBaradei regarded as outsider within Egypt . ElBaradei, a former director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency and a Nobel laureate, told CNN on Thursday that Morsy's departure will serve as a ""reset,"" so Egypt can start over in forming a constitution and putting together an inclusive government. With many of the Muslim Brotherhood members detained since Morsy's fall, ElBaradei acknowledged the need for a cohesive society that meets the needs of the Egyptian people and incorporates all sectors of the society. ""My fear is that the Brotherhood will fear that they are excluded. We need a quick delivery. And we need a cohesive society that is tolerant, that respects each other's differences,"" he said. With more than $1.3 billion of aid from the United States at stake for the Egyptian military, the interim government's next move is key in determining the geopolitics of the region, including its relations with the United States, the European Union and Israel. ""The military will continue to be pro-American, because of its reliance on U.S. foreign aid and military assistance, and the Egyptians who would be running in the future will be smart enough not to bring conflict with the U.S.,"" said Ashraf Singer, a member of the Egyptian Council for Foreign Affairs who has also worked closely with Egyptian government officials. U.S. President Barack Obama on Wednesday refrained from calling Morsy's ouster a ""coup,"" as such a statement would legally oblige the U.S. to stop the flow of military aid to Egypt. U.S. allies will take wait and see approach . Abdollahian said the U.S and the European Union are taking a wait and see approach, and his upcoming forecast predicts the U.S. and its allies will ""move cautiously and solely in support of the new government, but won't take a strong stance because of the risks of potential implications throughout the region."" Obama, advisers discuss 'fluid' situation in Egypt . He added that based on his group's analytics, the current military leadership does not want to be the sole political entity ruling the country and sees itself as only the custodian of the society. ""We predict that the military would support this parallel track of elections and constitutional reform that would be done in a more democratic fashion; and the United States and its allies will wait to see the outcome of this process and then decide on their strategic approach toward Egypt."" But Abdollahian says his models also forecast severe civil conflicts and the likelihood of ""attacks from the Muslim Brotherhood, especially in the troubled Sinai region."" ""Unfortunately we foresee strong potential for more bloodshed, where regular Egyptians are the casualties -- so the faster the military ensures and delivers the constitutional and democratic reform, the better it is for the people and avoiding a civil conflict,"" he said.

"Over the years, Americans have become familiar with terms such as ""white"" and ""Hispanic"" and even -- on government forms -- the more specific ""non-Hispanic white."" Now, courtesy of the mainstream media, there is a new phrase to add to our national lexicon: ""white Hispanic."" I don't like the sound of that. I've written about the thorny subjects of race and ethnicity for nearly a quarter century, and I rarely hear this term. We might have been able to see this coming given that there is no Hispanic race and Hispanics come in all colors. Still, mark my words. Wherever this road leads, it's not good -- not for Hispanics nor the rest of the country. The term -- white Hispanic -- emerged from the controversy over the fatal February 26 shooting of African-American teenager Trayvon Martin by neighborhood watch captain George Zimmerman in Sanford, Florida. Because Martin was black, and because it was initially assumed that Zimmerman was white, critics immediately charged that the shooting was racially motivated. Zimmerman's father, Robert, insisted that this wasn't true. In fact, he said it couldn't be true because his son is Hispanic. We have since learned that Zimmerman's mother is from Peru, and Zimmerman identifies himself as Hispanic. I'm not about to question how Zimmerman identifies himself. If the experience of having a president with a multiracial background who is nonetheless often referred to as simply black or African-American has taught us anything, it's that people can identify themselves any way they like but that they are often too complicated to be summed up with a label. Even so, that Zimmerman's father opted to play the ""Hispanic card"" to protect his son's reputation is unfortunate. I don't know if he ever described his son as Hispanic or half-Hispanic before the shooting. But it is awfully convenient that he would be so quick to describe him that way now. It is also absurd. Being Hispanic doesn't mean you can't also be racist. And the same goes for being white, black or any other color. Human nature dictates that we're all a little bigoted and narrow-minded, even if it is against members of our own group. It's easy to believe some stereotypes, or to think of some people as inferior to others. And being the member of a minority group doesn't make you immune to those impulses. You should hear how some Mexican-Americans talk about Mexican immigrants. It's not pretty, and it's not helpful. And this is from people who are close enough to the subject matter that they should know better. But what's even more troubling than what Zimmerman's father said is that some in the media seem to be bending over backward to get a particular message across. Rather than just refer to Zimmerman as Hispanic and be done with it, they created the hybrid term white Hispanic. My more cynical friends insist the strategy here is to preserve, by any means necessary, the narrative of a white racist who gunned down an unarmed black teenager. I won't go there. I don't think my media colleagues are intentionally trying to divide people and spark racial strife. Instead, I think they were looking for a way to avoid what would have been an embarrassing about-face. They didn't want to stand up and say: ""We were wrong. Without having all the facts, we made certain assumptions about the suspect. And now it turns out that it's not simple, that this story is more complicated than we thought and that this suspect is both white and Hispanic."" So they turned to the term white Hispanic. It is also possible that some in the media are afraid to frame the story as Hispanic versus African-American. I understand that. Relations between the nation's largest minority and the group that used to hold that title are tense enough without adding fuel to the fire. Whatever the reason for using this term, I don't like it. And I don't have any use for it. Are we now going to refer to people as white Hispanics and black Hispanics? Given that my complexion is a shade lighter than brown, should I be referred to as beige Hispanic? Where does this end? Americans need to discuss race and ethnicity in serious ways. The tragic death of a young person is a serious issue. Everything about this story must be taken seriously. Distorting the language shows we're not serious people.","Ruben Navarrette: There is a new term to add to our national lexicon, ""white Hispanic""
It's a label applied to George Zimmerman, who shot a black teenager, Navarrette says .
He says anyone, regardless of color, can be a racist whether white, Hispanic or black .
The media should have thought twice before turning to loaded term, Navarrette says ."
"A nuclear missile base in Montana that failed a safety test this month has let its security chief go. The 341st Missile Wing at Malmstrom Air Force Base operates about a third of the nation's Minuteman III nuclear missiles. It did not relieve Col. David Lynch from his command over the security forces group because of the failure, the base said in a statement released this week. But missile wing commander, Col. Robert Stanley, will feel more confident about passing the next inspection without him. Lynch led four squadrons and more than 1,200 people, whose duty it is to secure and protect the missile wing, which controls 150 long-range nuclear missile silos. Air Force unit fails nuke inspection . The 341st was the second nuclear missile wing to stumble over a safety and security inspection this year. It received an ""unsatisfactory rating"" after making ""tactical level errors"" during one of several exercises conducted as part of the inspection. The errors were not related to the operation of nuclear missiles, one Air Force official said. The precise issue was not disclosed. The wing, which includes about 3,000 personnel in total, was not ""decertified"" to conduct nuclear operations, which would have indicated a more significant failure. Earlier this year, another wing, based at Minot, North Dakota, did poorly in an inspection, resulting in the removal of 17 military personnel from their jobs. 17 Air Force officers stripped of authority to launch nuclear missiles .

"In 2012 the American people sent a message. They elected more women than ever to Congress, shattering glass ceilings across the nation and making it clear that this is a country that is ready for women's leadership. It's happening because voters know female leaders have the right priorities. They've fought for policies like the Violence Against Women Act and equal pay for equal work. Female leaders are the reason we have laws that ended gender discrimination in education. But even though we know women's leadership has helped create so much progress, there is still a ""men only"" sign on the door to the Oval Office. Across the country, Americans know it's time to change that. It's time to capitalize on the demand for women's leadership, harness the energy and ignite a movement that will put a woman in the White House. 2016 poll: If Clinton doesn't run, then who? Today, EMILY's List is launching a campaign to make that a reality. Our community of 2 million women and men across the country has worked to elect women to offices up and down the ballot. In my personal journey, I know how difficult it is to put women in leadership roles. The first campaign I managed was my own. I ran many times and lost many times when I ran for class president in my high school. In my junior year, I decided that I should run for student body president, because it wasn't just my class voting but the entire school. I put together a campaign plan that targeted only the freshmen and sophomore votes. I even got the younger sister of my opponent to join my campaign. I won. In the process, I learned my first campaign lesson: Never underestimate the power of women. There's a sister, and there's sisterhood. Now, I get to see that sisterhood at work every day. In the past 28 years EMILY's List has become the nation's largest resource for women in politics, and in that time we've done extensive research on women's leadership and women's priorities. Our most recent polling, conducted on likely 2016 voters in battleground states, proves without a doubt that the American people are ready for a female chief executive. Ninety percent of the people we polled say they would vote for a woman for president and 75% say a female president would be a good thing for the country. Of those surveyed, more thought a female president than a male president would be likely to put families ahead of politics and end partisan bickering. That's something we've known about women since we started helping them run for office in the 1980s. Kissinger gives a bit of a wink to idea of Clinton in 2016 . These female leaders have fought -- and fought hard -- to take a place at the table and make laws that improve the lives of American women and families. The results are undeniable. Because of this we know, our community knows, and countless Americans across the country know, that now is the time for a woman to be at the head of the table. So who will it be? There's one name on all our minds: Hillary Clinton. Voters across the country are excited about her possible run. But if she decides not to run, we still have a deep bench of incredible female leaders to choose from. From Cabinet secretaries and senators to the many female governors we'll have after 2014; there are numerous women who are ready to take on the challenge of leading our nation. Long after we've elected the first female president, we're going to keep electing even more American women, building a pipeline of state legislators and members of Congress, mayors and governors and senators, who will work their way up the ranks and be the second and 10th female presidents. We are standing on the edge of history. We are standing on the shoulders of the senators and suffragettes, civil rights activists and founding mothers, who have been the backbone of this great country. It's time for us to take the next step and make electing a female president part of our national story. When a woman runs for president, she will hear this one thing loud and clear from millions of women and men: We stand with you -- and we believe you can win. America is ready to elect its first Madam President.","Stephanie Schriock: In 2012, voters elected more women to Congress than ever before .

"The U.S. Air Force's nuclear command has been rocked by a cheating scandal involving nearly three dozen officers. Cheating on a proficiency exam involving intercontinental missile launch officers at the Global Strike Command at Malmstrom Air Force base in Montana apparently was carried out around last August and September by text and appears to be the largest incident of its kind, the Pentagon said. ""This is absolutely unacceptable behavior and it is completely contrary to our core values in the Air Force and as everybody here knows,  the No. 1 core value for us is integrity,"" Air Force Secretary Deborah Lee James told reporters. Officials said the nuclear arsenal is secure. The case involving 34 officers with the 341st Missile Wing stemmed from a drug possession investigation at multiple air bases in the United States and overseas. Two of those caught up in the cheating episode have been linked to the other probe, officials said. Sixteen officers were ultimately found to have actually cheated on the monthly proficiency exam while the rest knew the answers had been shared with others and did not report the violation, the Pentagon said. All those disciplined in the investigation are no longer certified to conduct nuclear operations. Air Force Chief of Staff Gen. Mark Welsh indicated there are enough officers on hand to securely maintain the nuclear missiles in Montana. He also echoed concern expressed by James about the integrity of the officers overseeing those caught up in the widespread cheating. ""We're going to look into this with every means at our disposal,"" he said. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel ""was deeply troubled"" to learn of the allegations and ""he strongly supports the aggressive steps the Air Force is taking in response to them,""  Pentagon spokesman Rear Adm. John Kirby said in a statement. Hagel just returned from visiting ICBM officers in Wyoming. There are approximately 190 officers overseeing readiness of nuclear weapons systems in Montana, meaning the scandal has touched nearly 20% of that force. The Air Force said all officers in the command will be re-tested by the end of Thursday. This is the latest incident to rock the Air Force nuclear operations. Last year, a missile unit at Malmstrom failed a safety and security inspection. They operate about a third of the 450 Minuteman III nuclear-tipped intercontinental ballistic missiles in the U.S. force, according to the Air Force statement. Also last year, another outfit based at Minot, North Dakota, did poorly in an inspection, resulting in the removal of 17 military personnel from their jobs.","Pentagon says scandal involves 34 officers .

"(CNN) -- The Washington Post's Chris Cillizza recently gave President Barack Obama his ""Worst Year in Washington"" award. Indeed, Cillizza wrote that there was a growing sense among the public that ""Obama simply isn't up to the job to which he was elected twice."" But while it's hard to argue that Obama has not had a difficult 12 months, the notion that this President is somehow done or a lame duck just doesn't feel quite right. The fact is the office of the president is still the most dynamic change agent in our political system. And unlike Congress or the Supreme Court, which go in and out of session, the President is on 24/7, with significant power at his disposal, a point underscored by recent initiatives on immigration, climate change and Cuba. ""My presidency's entering the fourth quarter,"" Obama said in a press conference Friday. ""Interesting stuff happens in the fourth quarter, and I'm looking forward to it."" That's particularly the case on foreign policy, where presidents usually go when they're stymied at home. And while Obama is clearly not the transformative foreign policy hero his supporters hoped he would be, neither is he the appeaser in chief his detractors claim. So, six years into his presidency, how is Obama's foreign policy shaping up, and what can we expect in his final two years? He's the anti-terrorist in chief . Obama's base may have wanted (and expected) a kinder, gentler leader when it came to the policy of killing America's enemies abroad. Instead, the President doubled down in Afghanistan in 2009, had Osama bin Laden killed, dismantled much of al Qaeda central and has used drone strikes with a frequency and lethality that makes him look like George W. Bush on steroids. The raw numbers speak for themselves: As of November 21, the United States had conducted 500 targeted killings (about 98% of them with drones), ""which have killed an estimated 3,674 people, including 473 civilians,"" according to the Council on Foreign Relations' Micah Zenko, citing State Department numbers. About 50 of these were authorized by Bush, and some 450 and counting by Obama. The President may have declared in May 2013 that the global war on terror is over. But there's no reason to believe that the trend line on specific counterterror attacks will go anywhere but up. Indeed, Syria and the war against ISIS is proving to be a new frontier. He's no nation-builder . Obama was determined to pull U.S. forces out of Afghanistan and Iraq and end America's combat role there. That isn't likely to happen by the time he leaves the White House. Indeed, it's possible by 2016 you might even see special forces expand their numbers in Iraq and enter Syria, too. But what the President has done is to refrain from illusory efforts at using American forces to reconstruct Iraq or Afghanistan, let alone Syria. If you want to understand Obama's policies on ISIS and the reintroduction of U.S. special forces into Iraq, it's best to look at them as significant counterterrorism operations designed both to enable the United States to hit targets and to train and equip local allies to do so. But the reality is that Obama is determined not to be drawn into another trillion-dollar social science experiment to see whether he can put the Iraq, Afghan and Syrian Humpty Dumpties back together again. Even when it comes to Syria, the President has been reluctant to establish ""no-fly"" zones to neutralize Bashar al-Assad's air power and create sanctuaries for training opposition forces. Indeed, the massive deployment of U.S. ground forces or billions in assistance to those bottomless money pits are red lines that this President is unlikely to cross in the next two years. He's a true believer in engagement . When Obama said back in the 2008 campaign that he was prepared to engage America's adversaries, he really wasn't kidding. The President is a committed internationalist with global sensibilities -- and probably far too invested in the power of diplomacy as the talking cure. Last year, using secret diplomacy, Obama started a process of negotiation on the Iranian nuclear issue and normalization efforts with Cuba that he hopes will produce real change. He all but admitted in his press conference last week that change will be slow, but he reaffirmed his faith and belief in the power of engagement. But belief in significant change in authoritarian states such as Cuba and Iran really represents the triumph -- at least for the moment -- of hope over experience. There's not a whole lot of evidence to suggest that real transformation ever occurs in these societies when driven from the outside -- it didn't in China, Russia or Vietnam. In Iran's case, buying time through diplomacy is premised on the highly arguable assumption that over time, Iran will somehow moderate its views and that the Iranian public, now freed from sanctions and integrated into the international community, won't want to return to the old days and will press their leaders to avoid becoming a pariah again. But being one screwdriver's turn away from a nuke may well be an Iranian national priority that the President's hope may not be able to alter. The next two years . Anyone watching the President's press conference last week could feel just how energized he was. And it wasn't just because he was going on vacation -- Obama can no doubt feel the pull of wanting to leave a positive legacy. Right now, he likely believes the corner has been turned on the economy, and he may even feel things are breaking his way on foreign policy, too. After all, ISIS' momentum has at least been temporarily stalled, while the decline in oil prices has taken Russian President Vladimir Putin down a notch or two. Plus, if Israeli elections due in March produce a more centrist government, John Kerry may start pushing Obama to get more engaged in the long-stalled peace process. Yet challenges remain -- the possibility of a terror attack always looms at home, while North Korea, Syria and Iraq are proving to be ongoing thorns in the U.S. side. And presidential luck can evaporate just as easily as it has appeared. Still, as tough as 2014 was, and although 2015 brings with it a Republican-controlled Congress bound to take some wind out of his sails, one thing is abundantly clear -- driven by legacy and momentum, this lame duck president plans to be doing a lot of quacking next year.","Aaron David Miller: President Obama is not the appeaser in chief his detractors claim .

"A majority of New York City voters rated Mayor Bill de Blasio positively in a new survey conducted largely before the shooting of two NYPD officers this weekend that put de Blasio in the national spotlight. The survey, conducted by Quinnipiac University, showed 53% of city voters viewed him favorably, while 33% viewed him unfavorably and another 10% say they haven't heard enough about him to decide. The mayor is underwater statewide, however, with 36% of New York state voters viewing him unfavorably, while 33% have a favorable view and another 29% say they haven't heard enough to decide. The survey was conducted from Dec. 17-21, partly before the Saturday shootings of two police officers in their patrol car in Brooklyn. The incident has inflamed already strained tensions between the mayor and the city's police force, and complicated a nationwide debate surrounding law enforcement tactics and treatment of minorities. De Blasio has taken center stage in the aftermath of the shootings, calling on Monday for unity and a hiatus from the protests that have gripped the city in recent weeks following the killings of two unarmed African American men at the hands of white police officers. But the Quinnipiac poll showed that through Sunday New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, also a Democrat, was widely seen as the more influential of the two in the state, with three-fourths of respondents rating him as such. More than half of the state's voters view Cuomo favorably, while a third view him unfavorably. New York Sen. Charles Schumer, who is up for reelection this cycle, is also widely popular, with 62% of the state's voters viewing him favorably. And looking towards the 2016 presidential contest, the state's former Democratic senator, Hillary Clinton, is still a strong favorite to win if she jumps in the race, as most expect. She leads Jeb Bush, the former GOP governor of Florida; Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul and New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie by anywhere from 26 points with Christie to 35 points with Paul. The survey was conducted among 1,293 New York state voters via landline and cell phone, and has a margin of error of 2.7 percent overall.","De Blasio was viewed positively by most New York City residents ahead of police shooting .

"The colorful Boris Berezovsky, who died in unexplained circumstances over the weekend at a country estate south of London, was one of the Russian oligarchs who made fortunes following the breakup of the former USSR. But by the time of his death the 67-year-old was reportedly in financial difficulties after he was ordered to pay a massive divorce settlement to his ex-wife as well as legal costs following the loss of a $6.5 billion lawsuit against fellow oligarch Roman Abramovich last year. His high-stakes later years were a far cry from his earlier career as a Moscow math professor and systems analyst who switched to more lucrative jobs in post-Soviet Russia, said CNN's Jill Dougherty, who interviewed him many times. Berezovsky went on to sell cars ""at a time when that was a luxury,"" she said. ""There were a lot of people who wanted to buy them, and he parlayed that -- as so many of these oligarchs did -- into something much, much bigger."" While Berezovsky made a good portion of his money from luxury car sales, his wealth and political influence skyrocketed when he bought into Russian media. He invested in the Moscow Independent Broadcasting Corp., which -- with TBS as a partner -- founded Moscow's first independent television station, TV-6. Under President Boris Yeltsin, the Russian Federation's first president from 1991 to 1999, ""there were really no rules governing anything,"" Dougherty said. Businessmen who came to be known as oligarchs amassed massive wealth and political influence in the 1990s during the privatization of Russia following the fall of the Soviet Union. Those like Berezovsky wound up lending the fledgling Russian government money ""when it was desperate for money,"" Dougherty said. ""These guys picked up companies on the cheap -- for pennies on the dollar."" A year or two later, the companies were worth much more, and the owners became wealthy. In return for backing Yeltsin, Berezovsky gained political influence within the Kremlin. He later backed Vladimir Putin for president, pouring money into the latter's political party. But after he was elected, Putin saw that the oligarchs had the potential to gain too much political power and moved to thwart them, Dougherty said. It has been widely reported that Putin resented the meddling of the oligarchs, particularly Berezovsky. Berezovsky did not have an easy time of it as an oligarch. ""There were two attempts on his life,"" said Stuart Loory, a former Turner Broadcasting System executive vice president and a former consultant to Berezovsky. ""One at his country home outside Moscow in a gated community. Somebody planted a bomb in his car and, fortunately, it didn't work very well. And the other was when he was leaving his club and there was a car bomb in the car and his driver was killed and he escaped without injury."" Within months of Putin's election in 2000, the government began trying to collect on tax claims against the oligarchs, including Berezovsky, who fled to Britain. Berezovsky began agitating from Britain against Putin, calling for a coup to oust the Russian president. In 2003, as Russia was seeking his return, Berezovsky was granted political asylum by British authorities after they realized he was wanted on political grounds, not criminal, according to published reports at the time. The case strained relations between Moscow and London. Berezovsky was convicted of fraud and tax evasion in absentia by a Russian court in 2007. He also accused Russia of trying to assassinate him, and eventually befriended Alexander Litvinenko, the FSB (the KGB's successor) agent who claimed to have been sent to kill him. Litvinenko himself died at a London hospital November 23, 2006, from a massive dose of the radioactive material polonium-210. In a deathbed statement he blamed Putin for his death, something the Kremlin strongly denied. Berezovsky later won libel damages in London over allegations that he was involved in Litvinenko's death, which were broadcast April 1, 2007, on RTR's news program Vesti Nedeli, or News of the Week. But he is believed to have been in serious financial difficulties after running up huge legal fees in recent years. In 2011 he paid out what was reported to have been Britain's biggest-ever divorce settlement to ex-wife Galina Besharova. The Daily Telegraph said the settlement was worth up to £220 million ($330 million). And Berezovsky made headlines the following year after losing what was called one of the most expensive private lawsuits in history against Abramovich, a former friend and ally. Berezovsky sued Abramovich, owner of Chelsea Football Club, for $5.1 billion, alleging that he was forced to sell his stake in the Russian oil company Sibneft for a fraction of its true value. The judge called Berezovsky's testimony unreliable and, at points, dishonest. Analysts put the price tag for legal fees alone at more than $250 million spent between the two sides, which Berezovsky was ordered to pay. Berezovsky was this year reported to be in serious financial difficulties; last week he sold an Andy Warhol screen print entitled ""Red Lenin"" for $200,000 and the mansion where he died was reported to be owned by his ex-wife. As speculation swirled about the cause of his death, Damian Kudriavtsev, a friend of Berezovsky, said Sunday that his friend was unhappy and was in financial trouble, but wouldn't have harmed himself. Berezovsky, he said, had always hoped to return to Russia someday. About two months ago, he sent a letter to Putin asking permission to return to Russia, Putin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said. ""He admitted that he had made a lot of mistakes, asked forgiveness for the mistakes and asked Putin to let him return home,"" Peskov said, according to a duty officer with the presidential press service. It's unknown whether Putin responded to the letter, but Berezovsky did not return.","Boris Berezovsky made fortune during the collapse of post-Soviet Russia .

"You've seen the headlines this week: ""Huge ice storm hits the South."" ""Disastrous snow storm heads toward East Coast."" If you live southeast of the Appalachians, weather bulletins about ice and snow have been almost impossible to avoid the past few days. But as scary as they sound, few realize it could be a whole lot more deadly. Even though the storms of February are not over, it is safe to say that their ultimate cost will be in the tens of billions of dollars and may further dampen what some economists believe is an already weak recovery. Production grinds to a halt in areas where there is no electricity. Goods cannot be transported over blizzard-closed highways. Plus, there is the human toll: People shivering in homes without power for days and lost wages because of factories shutting down when parts can't reach the assembly line. But here's an unexpected thought: Without weather science, all of this would be much worse. Live blog: Deadly weather . We only have to go back two weeks to get a glimpse of what life would be like without weather forecasts and storm warnings. Atlanta and Georgia officials chose to ignore accurate warnings of 1 to 3 inches of snow, resulting in utter gridlock and 22-hour one-way commutes. With that wake-up call, people took the forecasts seriously this time. Schedules were adjusted and people worked from home.  For days, meteorologists warned of widespread power failures. As of Wednesday afternoon, the number of people without power in the Southeast  -- the number of households without power multiplied by 3.5 people per household -- was more than 1 million and rising rapidly. It appears that most people in affected areas where power has been lost heeded the warnings so as to mitigate the effects. Track Winter weather in the South . And all that is because our nation's complex weather infrastructure -- state-of-the-art technology, satellites in the sky, powerful computers on the ground and talented, committed professionals in the public and private sector -- is making it easier and faster for you to know when the big one is coming, saving money and saving lives. As I explained in my book, ""Warnings: The True Story of How Science Tamed the Weather,"" America's life-saving storm warning system was created by dedicated scientists fighting storms and bureaucracy to provide the accurate warnings we enjoy today. Over the years, a beneficial division of duties has evolved: The taxpayer-funded National Weather Service provides the meteorological infrastructure needed by everyone as well as forecasts and storm warnings for the public-at-large. Snow, ice pummel Southeast, stranding drivers, cutting power . Private-sector weather organizations such as CNN and AccuWeather draw on this infrastructure to provide specifically tailored forecasts and storm warnings needed by television audiences, businesses and other specialized clientele. This system works extraordinarily well. America's Weather Enterprise -- the sum of the National Weather Service, related federal agencies, commercial weather companies and local meteorologists -- are all striving to build a weather-ready nation. And there is plenty of work yet to be done: . -- More and better measurements of the state of the atmosphere. -- Better computer models that can use those measurements to create more accurate forecast guidance. -- Accurate, timely forecasts for the public. -- Specialized services for businesses, government agencies and others to suit their specific requirements. -- Educating the public and specialized users about the ways to use weather information most effectively to protect people and property. Unfortunately, there are those who propose putting the safety of the public in jeopardy by changing the emphasis of the National Weather Service to an organization primarily dedicated to giving ""decision-support services."" This means that instead of a successful, vital agency providing and maintaining the weather infrastructure to make sure we know when the next storm is coming -- all based on real data -- they would be turned into governmental ""consultants"" with the duty to help bureaucrats and others make decisions. For instance, as the current ice storm was developing, a forecaster at the Atlanta National Weather Service office wrote Monday in an ""area forecast discussion"" that he didn't have sufficient time for forecasting the ice storm because he was spending most of his time on ""decision support."" Whether it is a hurricane, ice storm, blizzard or tornado looming, what does that taxpayer prefer? An accurate storm warning for everyone, or the National Weather Service forecasters distracted by giving weather briefings to specialized groups, something that may not be part of their core expertise? By keeping the current division of duties, the American Weather Industry can boost the American economy  -- and provide much-needed jobs -- while saving the government money. It is a win-win for everyone.","Mike Smith says that advances in weather science have made forecasting much better .
A robust weather infrastructure and public/private partnerships have improved forecasts .
But, Smith argues, proposed changes in the National Weather Service could impact safety ."
"More than 6-in-10 Americans believe that Sony Pictures' decision to cancel the release of ""The Interview"" was an overreaction, according to a CNN/ORC poll released on Tuesday. But the U.S. public does think that the incidents which led to that decision were acts of terrorism on the part of North Korea and nearly three-quarters of all Americans say that North Korea is a serious threat to the U.S. That puts North Korea at the very top of the public's threat list -- only Iran comes close.  And Kim Jong Un is the most unpopular world leader tested in the poll. Eighty-four percent of all Americans have an unfavorable view of Kim; only 1% say they have a positive view of him.  That ranks Kim higher (or lower, depending on your point of view) than Fidel Castro, Vladimir Putin, and the leaders of Iran, Syria and China.

"Russia became more isolated Tuesday than it has been at any time since the end of the Cold War after new, hard-hitting sanctions were announced by the European Union and the United States, U.S. officials said. U.S. President Barack Obama said the measures would take an ""even bigger bite"" out of the stagnant Russian economy than sanctions Washington and the EU had already implemented against Russia over its disputed annexation of Crimea and its support of pro-Russian rebels fighting the Ukrainian government. ""The major sanctions we're announcing today will continue to ratchet up the pressure on Russia including the cronies and companies supporting Russia's illegal activities in the Ukraine,"" he said from the White House South Lawn. ""In other words, today Russia is once again isolating itself from the international community, setting back decades of genuine progress."" He said the EU sanctions showed to him a waning patience with Russian President Vladimir Putin and the impact of the shoot-down of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17, which had many Europeans among the 298 people on board when it exploded over volatile eastern Ukraine. Some of the new EU sanctions target eight ""cronies"" of Putin and three ""entities"" by limiting their access to EU capital markets, an EU official said on condition of anonymity. The people and entities will be named Wednesday, the official said. Three state-owned banks named Tuesday by Washington means five of the top six financial institutions in Russia were on the sanctions list, according to a senior Obama administration official. Four-fifths of their debt is in U.S. dollars, the official said. New sanctions will also impact the future of Russia's important oil businesses with technology licensing restrictions, another senior administration official said. Restrictions will affect Russia's ability to produce oil from deep-water wells and shale fields, sectors it is only beginning to explore. The sanctions, however, are not part of a new Cold War, Obama said. ""What it is, is a very specific issue related to Russia's unwillingness to recognize that Ukraine can chart its own path,"" Obama said. The EU sanctions also will block new arms contracts between Europe and Russia, prohibit the export of European goods that can be used for both civilian and military purposes and limit the export of energy-related equipment, the EU said in a written statement Tuesday evening. The European Union had previously been reluctant to issue harsher sanctions against Russia because both regions rely on one another for about $500 billion in trade and investment each year, according to CNNMoney. ""It is meant as a strong warning: Illegal annexation of territory and deliberate destabilization of a neighboring sovereign country cannot be accepted in 21st century Europe,"" the European Council's statement reads. One of the senior administration officials said Russia hasn't been this isolated ""since the end of the Cold War."" Obama said Russia could choose a different path. ""It didn't have to come to this. It does not have to be this way,"" Obama said. ""This is a choice that Russia and President Putin in particular has made. ... The path for a peaceful resolution to this crisis involves recognizing the sovereignty, the territorial integrity and the independence of the Ukrainian people."" Investigators thwarted again . Meanwhile, international investigators and observers were prevented for the third straight day from reaching the MH17 crash site. The Dutch Justice Ministry said its team was unable to leave the city of Donetsk because of violence. The 50-strong team of Dutch and Australian experts, accompanied by monitors from the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe, was also forced to abandon its attempts to reach the site Sunday and Monday. Dutch investigators have yet to lay eyes on the wreckage or the human remains believed still to be strewn across the huge debris field near the town of Torez. U.S. and Ukrainian officials have said that a Russian-made missile system was used to shoot down MH17 from rebel territory. Russia and the rebels have disputed the allegations and blamed Ukraine for the crash. Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte asked Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko in a phone call Tuesday morning to halt the fighting around the crash site so that investigators can access it, Rutte spokesman Jean Fransman said. Ukraine FM: The bitter lessons of MH17 . Reports of ballistic missiles . The United States and others say Russia has provided arms to rebels in eastern Ukraine, including heavy weapons such as a missile system like the one believed used to down the Malaysian airliner 12 days ago. Despite previous sanctions, the flow of weapons continues and on Tuesday the fighting appeared to have entered a dangerous new phase. There were reports that Ukraine's government in the past 48 hours used short-range ballistic missiles against the rebels, three U.S. officials told CNN. The weapons have a range of about 50 miles (80 kilometers) and pack up to 1,000-pound (454-kilogram) warheads. If the reports are accurate, they are the most deadly missiles used in the conflict to date. The U.S. officials did not specify where the missiles hit or what damage they caused. One U.S. official said there has been no reaction from Russia so far. Another of the U.S. officials said using the missiles is ""an escalation, but Ukraine has a right to defend itself."" Ukrainian Foreign Minister Pavlo Klimkin acknowledged that his country's military has short-range missiles, but denied that the military fired any. In a joint news conference with Klimkin, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry praised Ukrainian officials for proposing a peace plan that includes ""serious and substantive dialogue with the Russian-backed separatists."" Russia: Checkpoint came under fire . Russia's Foreign Ministry said in a statement on its website that a Russian checkpoint had come under fire from Ukrainian forces. It says Ukrainian officers used automatic weapons and grenades at the Gukovo customs checkpoint, causing damage. On Tuesday, Klimkin, the Ukrainian foreign minister, denied that Ukrainian forces had fired into Russia. The defense minister for the self-declared Donetsk People's Republic, Igor Strelkov, said that there had been ""extremely severe"" battles between his rebel forces and the Ukrainian military in the area of Shaktarsk and Torez. He said a number of injured rebel fighters, as well as some medical personnel, had been evacuated from Donetsk to Russia. Moscow has denied arming and supporting the rebels, but Strelkov's words indicate that Russia is serving as a kind of haven for the rebels.

"New Jersey Governor Chris Christie sharply criticized President Obama's decision to normalize relations with Cuba, saying he did not get enough out of the deal. In a one-two punch, Christie also charged the President with not being assertive in the wake of the Sony Pictures hacking incident. Following up on a letter that he sent to the White House over the weekend, Christie said it was incomprehensible that Obama went ahead with the change in diplomatic relations with Cuba given that leaders within that country have granted asylum to Joanne Chesimard, who escaped from prison after she was convicted of slaying a New Jersey state trooper in the 1970s. Related: Historic thaw in U.S., Cuba standoff . Related: Christie wants Obama to tell Cuba to hand over cop killer . ""These thugs in Cuba have given her political asylum for 30 years,"" Christie said. ""It's unacceptable to have a reopening of diplomatic relations with Cuba, and unacceptable to even consider taking them off the terrorist watch list if they are harboring a convicted cop killer,"" he told an interviewer Monday night. ""She murdered, in cold blood, a New Jersey state trooper on the side of the road who was just doing his job."" Chesimard, a member of the Black Liberation Army who is now known as Assata Shakur, remains one of the top ten on the FBI's most-wanted list. ""Yet there's been no conversation that anyone is aware of regarding sending her back to complete her sentence,"" the governor said. Calling Obama's Cuba announcement an ""awful deal,"" Christie faulted the President both for failing to work out an extradition agreement on Chesimard and for not insisting on greater political reforms in exchange for the change in status. ""What did the United States get? And more importantly what did those people who are persecuted and whose human rights are violated in Cuba get in return for America now opening up its economic and travel doors, and (granting) full diplomatic relations with the power and majesty that that has to have an American embassy in your country,"" Christie said during the hour-long interview Monday night with New Jersey anchor Steve Adubato on the PBS television station NJTV. The New Jersey governor declined, however, to weigh in on the handling by New York City leaders of this weekend's shooting of two New York City police officers. When pressed, he said that while many were trying to score ""political points"" on the issue, he believed it was a time to allow the families of the officers to grieve. Before analyzing the culture surrounding the shootings, he urged all Americans ""to take a deep breath and to think about the loss that's been suffered by these two families,"" and to pray for them. ""There's plenty of time for us to discuss it, but I'm not going to be someone who is going to participate in this at the moment,"" he said. Related: De Blasio facing tensions further strained by killing of NYPD officers . Turning to the alleged hacking of Sony by North Korea, Christie said that he agreed with President Obama's assertion that Sony made a mistake by pulling the movie ""The Interview"" after a cyberattack. But Christie took issue with Obama's comment during a year-end press conference that he wished Sony had called him before making the decision to pull the movie because theaters were canceling showings. ""He certainly was briefed about the attack,"" Christie said of the president. ""It seems to me that it's the obligation of the President of the United States to call them."" ""Sony made a mistake by backing off, and I think, quite frankly the President made a mistake by not being assertive, and getting everybody into the White House—from Sony, and the movie theater companies that Sony was complaining about, and the intelligence community—and say 'O.K., what's the nature of the threat and what can we do to stop it. Is there a safe way to show this movie?'"" ""That's what a leader does,"" Christie said. Related: Poll shows Americans think Sony overreacted .

"(CNN)The Algerian military has killed the leader of an Algerian terror group that beheaded French hiker Herve Gourdel earlier this year, the state-run Algeria Press Service reported Tuesday. Gouri Abdelmalek, leader of Jund al Khilafa, and two other militants were killed in the Algerian city of Isser after the military set an unspecified ""trap,"" for them, APS reported Tuesday, citing Algeria's defense ministry. The report of Abdelmalek's death comes roughly three months after Jund al Khilafa -- a small Islamist group formerly linked to al Qaeda -- published a video showing the beheading of Gourdel in what the group said was a display of support to al Qaeda's rival ISIS. Gourdel, 55, was hiking in central Algeria's Djudjura National Park when he was abducted in September. Jund al Khilafa, having just declared allegiance to the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS), then published a video of Gourdel's beheading on September 24. The video was titled, ""A message of blood for the French government."" The group said it was responding to an appeal by ISIS spokesman Muhammad al-Adnani to kill ""the spiteful and filthy French"" because of their support for military action against the group in Iraq. A video message showing the execution was designed to resemble beheadings carried out by ISIS, as were the words of one of the militants, who said: ""Let the French people know that their blood is cheap for their President, and it is the same as you made the blood of the Muslim women and children cheap in Iraq and Sham (Syria)."" The Algerian government called the beheading an act of ""criminals,"" and French President Francois Hollande said at the time that Algeria's Prime Minister assured him he would do the utmost to find the killers. On Monday, the Algerian army launched its attack in Isser after tracking what it believed was ""a dangerous terrorist group driving a vehicle"" in the city, the Algerian defense ministry said, according to APS. Abdelmalek was later confirmed as one of the three that the army killed, APS reported Tuesday. Jund al Khilafa, which means ""Soldiers of the Caliphate,"" had been a part of al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb. Abdelmalek, who was the commander of AQIM's central region, said in September that his fighters were abandoning AQIM because of ""the certain deviation of the methods of the mother organization al-Qaeda, and that of the Islamic Maghreb."" Abdelmalek had been active in a militant Islamist insurgency in Algeria for 14 years. Gourdel was just one of the Westerners to be beheaded by an Islamist extremist group this year. Since mid-August, ISIS has beheaded American journalists Steven Sotloff and James Foley, British aid worker David Haines, British aid convoy volunteer Alan Henning, and American aid worker Peter Kassig. CNN's Tim Lister and Steve Almasy contributed to this report.","Gouri Abdelmalek led Jund al Khilafa, which killed French hiker Herve Gourdel in September .

"It's one of the most influential offices in a building full of partisan bickering and mudslinging -- and its leader is supposed to rise above politics. The Congressional Budget Office director's term is up in less than two weeks and recent reports indicate Republicans won't give Democratic appointee Doug Elmendorf another four years leading the office charged with projecting the cost of bills. Instead, Republicans may look to pick a successor whose numbers will better jive with theirs. The potential shake-up comes as Republicans -- including influential House Budget Chairman Tom Price of Georgia -- push to change how the office makes its calculations. Rather than having the office crunch the numbers on new policies based on the current economic landscape, Republicans would like to employ a method called ""dynamic scoring."" This approach takes into account people changing their behavior based on the policy changes, which the GOP feels will make it easier to push for tax cuts. That's because under ""static scoring,"" tax cuts show up in the budget simply as a revenue loss. But under dynamic scoring, the CBO would theoretically take into account GOP arguments that such cuts would stimulate economic growth and as a result either pay for themselves or create even greater tax revenue down the road. And the stakes are high when it comes to other highly debated policies. Over the next two years, Congress is expected to debate everything from the budget to immigration reform, and will rely on the CBO to estimate the costs. Those numbers can drive the political debate, as they are highly cited in the media and by politicians seeking advantage. Plus, there's Obamacare. Republicans have vowed to hone in on Obama's signature piece of domestic legislation, which they say will add $131 billion to the deficit over the next 10 years, a stark contrast to the CBO's projections that the 2010 law will reduce the deficit by about $124 billion. Though CBO projections have been steeped in a strong tradition of independent, nonpartisan analysis over the office's 40-year history, some say Republicans could appoint a director who would insert his bias as he or she looks at the cost and economic impact of proposed legislation. Founding CBO director Alice Rivlin, a Democrat, said political appointees from both sides of the aisle have upheld that nonpartisan tradition since she became the office's first director, winning respect from both sides of the aisle, and she believes that tradition will continue. ""One would hope that you would have a CBO director who does not let ideology get in the way of making good estimates,"" said Rivlin, who now works at the Brookings Institution. ""[Congress] values having a credible institution that they can rely on to give them the best estimates possible."" But Stan Collender, a former House and Senate budget committee staffer, said the hyperpartisan climate in Washington could lead Republicans to pick a budget director who would stray from the office's impartial mission. ""This could be the beginning of the end of the congressional budget office if it loses credibility,"" said Collender, now the executive vice president at Qorvis MSLGROUP. ""It's not clear that whoever the Republicans pick will be nonpartisan. The fact that it's been relatively true in the past doesn't mean it's going to continue in the future."" ""What's going on now is you've got one side, whoever's in charge, trying to impose their will on the other,"" Collender said. It's not atypical for a new majority in Congress to appoint one of their own to the CBO once the incumbent's term is up, but the conservative charge not to reappoint Elmendorf as director comes amid a racket of support from economists on the left and the right. RELATED: David Koch is a 'social liberal' but votes with his wallet . Greg Mankiw, former chairman of President George W. Bush's Council of Economic Advisors, wrote in a blog post last month that Elmendorf has demonstrated both ""competence and impartiality"" and ""shown himself to be scrupulously nonpartisan"" as CBO head. ""I understand that GOP leaders may be tempted to put their own stamp on the Congressional Budget Office. But sometimes the benefits of continuity transcend ideology and political affiliation,"" Mankiw wrote. And Democrats, many of whom have had their own complaints about Elmendorf, would go haywire if Republicans look to change the character of the CBO. ""Any effort by Republicans to interfere with the professional integrity of the CBO by selecting someone to push their failed 'trickle down' economic theory of tax cuts for the wealthy through dynamic scoring would undermine the credibility of CBO and the entire budget process,"" said Rep. Chris Van Hollen, the top Democrat on the House Budget Committee. Incoming House Budget Committee Chairman Tom Price's spokesman declined to comment on whether Elmendorf would be replaced in January. But former CBO director and Republican appointee Doug Holtz-Eakin said he believes the ""ratio of rhetoric to reality here is extremely high."" ""There's always a concern that the next CBO director is going to politicize the place,"" said Holtz-Eakin, now president of the American Action Forum. ""It never happens."" But even if a CBO director would never ""put their finger on the scales,"" Holtz-Eakin said, the CBO director does have influence over what issues and studies are prioritized. And the party leadership is sure to drive their priorities into the office with their own person at the helm. And to really change procedure, congressional budget leaders would need to alter the budget office's rules for calculating the legislation costs -- something Price has tried to do through legislation. Putting someone in charge who would eschew the rules as they are would set a serious precedent, one that could hurt Republicans if Democrats take back the Hill.","Republicans likely won't reappoint congressional budget director Doug Elmendorf when his term ends next month .
Two ex-CBO directors say the office will remain nonpartisan, but others worry the hyperpartisan environment could change the calculus .

"A safe distance from Nairobi's Westgate Mall, several Kenyans stare through a stand of trees at the site of one of the nation's worst terrorist attacks. The opulent mall has proudly stood for six years -- like a glittering city within a city in the popular enclave of Westlands, about 15 miles from slums where residents struggle daily to survive. But Saturday's attack by Al-Shabaab terrorists has left dozens dead, turning the 350,000 square foot, five-story shopping complex into a symbol of a very different kind. Related story: Kenya mall shooting enters fourth day . Among the onlookers Tuesday gathered at a cordoned off area near the scene of the attack, cab driver Benjamin Kamau said he doesn't feel safe anymore. The tragedy has shaken him. It will take a long time to return to any sense of safety or normalcy. Westgate Mall has made its name as a place to see and be seen -- where shoppers sipped frozen yogurt, caught a movie and shopped for the latest fashions amid an extravagant waterfall and casino. For the nation's wealthy, it was a taste of the West in their own backyard: 80 stores including Samsung, Nike and Adidas -- lined its pristine, peach colored marble hallways. For Kenya's expatriate community, the mall was a taste of familiarity in a land far from home. Related story: Kenya tourism suffers another blow . Now, pools of blood have smeared once shiny floors. Coffee shops that were once filled with lively chatter have been littered with half-empty latte cups left by shoppers trying to escape with their lives. On the day of the attack, my cousin, Charles Mugo, and his two daughters, ages 6 and 3, found themselves with about 40 other shoppers in the mall parking garage. They'd just returned from a grocery store to pick up food for the family dog, Muthaka, when gunmen stormed in, AK-47 rifles blazing. Mugo came face-to-face with one of the terrorists, a lanky, 6-foot man, wearing a black scarf-like cloth on his head and magazines of ammunition around his waist. ""Just like Rambo does in the movies,"" Mugo recalls. ""We're not here to rob you, we're here to kill you,"" the gunman announced to the crowd. ""You've been killing our women and children in Somalia."" When the gunmen demanded to know if they were Muslim, Mugo hesitated just long enough for the attackers to turn their attention to a man nearby. The man stared at them blankly when one attacker tested him by asking who the Prophet Muhammad's mother was. They shot at him -- the bullet ripping through his coat -- but leaving him unharmed. The interaction lasted long enough for Mugo to push his two girls under a parked car, and for him to stoop low behind it. They waited, and waited. ""Girls, did you pray today?"" he whispered. ""I've prayed five times already,"" the older daughter told him. ""I don't want to die today."" Ninety minutes passed. By then, the gunshots did not sound as close.  They felt confident enough to make a run for safety. ""Westgate bad, blood,"" the younger daughter told me later. She showed me scratches on her face from laying flat on the ground. ""I ran, ran, ran."" Eventually, the Mugos escaped unharmed. Kenyans and foreigners died in attacks scattered across the complex. It was the deadliest terror attack in Kenya since al Qaeda blew up the U.S. Embassy there in 1998, killing 213 people. Terrorism experts say the attack bears eerie similarities to the 2008 siege of a hotel in Mumbai, India -- another upscale target with Western appeal. Lashkar-e-Taiba, a Pakistani terrorist group that attacked the hotel for more than three days, killing 166 people. Related story: Could Kenya mall shooting happen elsewhere? The Nairobi attack targeted non-Muslims at a stylish mall. ""This is a soft target. It's in a high profile area,"" said CNN military analyst retired Lt. Col. Rick Francona. ""There's going to be a lot of foreigners there, a lot of wealthy there. This is -- this was well-planned and well-thought out."" CNN national security analyst Fran Townsend said, ""There is no sort of hard perimeter by which you could screen for security purposes, and so it's difficult to protect."" The tragedy has changed many who've been touched by it. Four days after the attack, Mugo is still trying to sort out his feelings. ""You have to take time to let it sink in. I think I'm still in shock,"" he said.  ""All I keep thinking of was what if they were different scenarios. What if I had parked at a different place. What if I had not gone to that mall. At the time, all I kept thinking was I just couldn't let these girls die."" Outside the mall, the Kenyans keep watch. From a distance. Kamau, the taxi driver, shakes his head.

"(CNN)Newspaper editor Benjamin C. Bradlee died in October, aged 93. He was a giant of journalism, a real lion. In fact after Watergate and Woodward and Bernstein and the taking down of President Richard M. Nixon in the mid-1970s for corruption and subverting democracy, journalism schools in America were bursting at the seams with young would-be Woodward and Bernsteins. Bradlee and his fearless reporters launched a thousand careers -- including mine. Ben was also a friend. I met him after his glory days as Executive Editor of the Washington Post; He in his Emeritus years and I, a galavanting foreign correspondent. I admired the heck out of him. He was mesmerizing in the sheer breadth of his knowledge and his lifetime experience. For all his achievements and accomplishments, read my friend Marilyn Berger's definitive obituary in the New York Times. Ben was also hilarious and courtly, ribald and bawdy, handsome and craggy and full of the best stories ever. At dinner, he could conjure up a whole spellbinding era of the history he had lived and covered -- before the main course was served -- and often in French! And that was part of his gravitational pull; Ben embodied a different era, when top-flight journalists were the friends and counselors of presidents, as he was to  John F. Kennedy. And when need be, their adversary, as with the mounting Watergate revelations.  Ben defined the times when a headline, a story, a byline in the Washington Post et al, could shift history. The truth is, his reporters would have followed him through rings of fire. I consider myself unbelievably lucky to have worked for two of the great revolutionaries of our business, Ted Turner who created CNN and changed the world with 24/7 global news, and Don Hewitt, the legendary TV innovator and creator of 60 Minutes. I wish I could have worked for Ben. But perhaps I was luckier, certainly I was enormously proud, to call him my friend. Lorin Maazel . A little earlier this year, renowned conductor Lorin Maazel died, aged 84, after a long and distinguished career as Grand Maestro. While we weren't close friends, I think I can say we bonded through an extraordinary  shared experience: The 2008 visit by the New York Philharmonic Orchestra to Pyongyang, North Korea. In light of the U.S. government accusing North Korea of the massive hack-attack against Sony at the end of this year, it is extraordinary to look back and reflect on a different atmosphere that existed between the two countries for a brief moment in time. Along with a large delegation of international press, I was invited to travel with the New York Philharmonic on a cultural odyssey. Maestro Maazel was thrilled; just as ping pong diplomacy had opened the door to normalizing relations between the United States and communist China, he told me he hoped musical diplomacy could do the same with one of the last bastions of entrenched communist dictatorship. And so one freezing, sunny morning in February, a planeload of enthusiasts all landed in Pyongyang in a flourish the likes of which the government and the people had never seen. We watched as Maazel and his musicians prepped and rehearsed, gave masterclasses to some of North Korea's top musicians, and finally delivered a bravura performance on stage at the city's main concert hall. The audience was treated to all-American tunes by George Gershwin and the concert ended with one of Korea's best-loved folk songs, Arirang.  North Korea's invited elite were on their feet with standing ovations. And for two countries still officially at war, since the Korean War ended only with an armistice, just imagine how it felt in that concert hall -- and for Koreans listening on radio and TV at home -- to hear both countries' national anthems played in public on stage for the first time. Remember this was during the Bush Administration -- George W. Bush had called North Korea part of the Axis of Evil, and yet change was in the air. Away from the concert hall, I was one of a small group of journalists taken to the Yongbyon nuclear plant, where then leader Kim Jong Il had started mothballing crucial parts and freezing the weapons program.  A few months later I went back to witness North Korea blow up the plant's iconic cooling tower. It seemed Lorin Maazel and the New York Philharmonic were on to something. But shortly thereafter Kim Jong Il fell ill and died, his son Kim Jong Un came to power with a ruthless streak, a penchant for testing his nuclear weapons, and apparently capable of massive cyber attacks on America's top companies. Lorin Maazel died without realizing this dream, but I am grateful to have been there for that brief moment in time when he brought hope and the sound of beautiful music to North Korea.

"We're not done yet. That was the message terrorists of Al-Shabaab gave to Kenya on Wednesday, as officials still sorted through rubble and clues left in the wake of the recent massacre that took 67 lives at a Nairobi shopping mall. Read more: How does Al-Shabaab get its money? The Somali militant group handed the threatening statement to regional media, which passed it on to CNN. For four days, starting on September 21, Al-Shabaab fighters spread gunfire and flames through Nairobi's Westgate Shopping Mall, leaving it partially destroyed, stained in blood and littered with bodies. CNN's Zain Verjee: I can't get image of Westgate bodies out of my mind . Members of Kenya's government were mute about what they had seen inside after emerging from an inspection there earlier this week. CNN learned that the Westgate mall attackers tortured some of the hostages. Military doctors said militants severed hands, cut off noses and, in some cases, hanged hostages. CNN has seen photographic evidence of one dead victim with a hand amputated. In the coming days and weeks, members of Parliament are expected to grill intelligence officials to find out more about how the attack occurred. Forewarned? A number of Kenya's Cabinet members and defense officials were warned about the possibility that Al-Shabaab was planning to carry out such an attack a year before gunman stormed the Nairobi mall, according to several police and intelligence sources. The warnings were made by the country's National Intelligence Service as part of regular situational reports given to Cabinet members, the inspector general of police, members of the National Security Advisory Council and military intelligence officials. CNN has seen an electronic version of those reports, which contain an extensive list of terror threats from several regions across Kenya over an extended period, but they also specify Al-Shabaab posed a threat to several targets, including Westgate Shopping Mall. The news about the intelligence warnings comes amid revelations that the mall favored by Westerners and tourists was long considered a possible terror target. Kenyans debate: Time to get troops out to Somalia? Al-Shabaab made statements claiming responsibility, including saying on Twitter that it sent the gunmen in retaliation for Kenya's involvement in an African Union military effort against the group, which is al Qaeda's proxy in Somalia. Kenyan forces killed five terrorists, and 11 others are in custody over possible links to the attacks, President Uhuru Kenyatta has said. But an immense amount of work remains to learn how Al-Shabaab was able to pull off such a well-coordinated and brazen attack. The terror group was thought to be badly bruised by recent losses in its Somalian homeland. Kenyan military intervention . Last year, the Kenyan military was part of a peacekeeping force that defeated Al-Shabaab forces to liberate the key Somali port of Kismayo. Since Kenya launched attacks against Al-Shabaab in Somalia in 2011, the group has hurled grenades at Kenyan churches, bus stops and other public places. The mall attack was the deadliest terror attack in Kenya since al Qaeda blew up the U.S. Embassy there in 1998, killing 213 people. Terrorism experts say the attack bears eerie similarities to the 2008 siege of a hotel in Mumbai, India, another upscale target with Western appeal.

"An unlicensed doctor has been charged with causing an HIV outbreak in a remote village in northwestern Battambang province, local media report. More than 800 panicked residents of Rokar village sought testing after reports of infections emerged last week. Some 106 people tested positive for HIV, according to the National AIDS authority. A provincial court has laid three charges against the unlicensed doctor, Yem Chroeum, including intentionally transmitting the HIV virus and running a clinic without permission from the Ministry of Health, police said. The police confirmed Chroeum used contaminated needles.

""[Serbia] has a very long tradition of film making,"" says Ana Ilic, executive director of the Serbia Film Commission. ""Back in the 1970s and 1980s, there were so many huge co-productions that were made here."" And now, filmmakers are taking notice once again as Serbia steps up its efforts to raise its profile as an important player in international filmmaking. From medieval castles to jagged mountains to modern cityscapes, it seems that every corner and crevice in Serbia can make the cut in Hollywood. International hits shot at least partly in the country include the film adaptation of William Shakespeare's ""Corolianus,"" starring Ralph Fiennes and Gerard Butler, the 2012 period thriller ""The Raven,"" with John Cusack, while recently Pierce Brosnan returned to the country too to film spy action thriller ""The November Man."" ""Serbia has done some really great productions in recent years,"" says Ilic. ""It has proven to be a really good competitive high-quality service filming destination -- it is quite hot now."" 'Serbia, NOT Siberia!' Serbia's renewed focus on building an impressive reputation in international movie production is benefiting several local industry players. One of them is film producer is Andjelka Vlaisavljevic, who is matching her movie-making savvy with a meticulous approach to budgets to win more and more big budget films. She says that it wasn't always that way. ""They would say, 'Siberia,' no way, we are not going there, it's cold!' And so, it's like 'no no no, it's Serbia!'  [You] can you imagine what the reaction to Serbia was,"" jokes Vlaisavljevic, founder of Work in Progress Productions. ""That's changed completely now,"" she continues. ""The buzz is out that here it's not just very good crews and all that, but it's a good time that you have working in Belgrade. And again, everybody has such a low expectations when it comes to us, then they get pleasantly surprised and so they like it here."" Resilient industry . But it's not just movie producers taking advantage of Serbia's bid to emerge as a key force in international filmmaking. Bojan Peric is a Serbian actor who's found success at home, and went on to appear at ""Lockout."" He says he's proud not just of his own accomplishments but of the talent and skill of the crews and production teams he works with. ""During all those bad times that happened in the past an industry that did not fall back was the film industry,"" he says. ""That's important for the culture of the people and I believe that a country makes its image through culture."" Read this: The ancient craft of Pirot carpet weaving .

"(CNN)Most of us can clearly recall where we were on December 26, 2004, when a massive earthquake off the northern coast of Sumatra, Indonesia triggered a deadly tsunami that swept across the Indian Ocean, killing more than 226,000 people and causing massive destruction along coastal areas of 14 countries. The tsunami caused one of the worst natural disasters in recent memory, as its full horror unfolded on TV screens around the world. Ten years on, it is important to reflect on what the tsunami has taught us and whether these communities are any safer from such disasters. One clear lesson reinforced by the tsunami has been the importance of investing in disaster risk reduction (DRR) at both global and local levels. In January 2005, The Hyogo Framework for Action (HFA) -- a global blueprint for disaster risk reduction efforts with a ten-year plan -- was adopted by 168 governments. Its goal was to substantially reduce disaster losses by 2015 by building the resilience of nations and communities to disasters. In June 2006, the Indian Ocean Tsunami Warning System became active, consisting of 25 seismographic stations -- used to detect earthquakes early -- relaying information to 26 national tsunami information centers. This has resulted in timely evacuations of mass populations when alerts are sounded. Removing red tape . The tsunami also highlighted how weak legislation led to blockages and major coordination challenges in the delivery of international assistance. The Hyogo Framework for Action calls for improved legislation to facilitate international disaster response, an area where the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) has been working closely with governments through its Disaster Laws program. Twelve countries in Asia Pacific have made, or are progressing towards, legislative or regulatory changes. These include Indonesia, where the National Disaster Management Authority has revised its regulations relating to the participation of the international community in national emergencies. Another example is the Philippines, where, following Typhoon Haiyan in 2013, the government relaxed immigration requirements and established one-stop-shops to streamline the clearance process for incoming goods and equipment. But global and national initiatives need to go hand-in-hand with investment in locally driven approaches towards reducing risk. Working with communities to help them be better prepared to face future disasters was the thread that ran through the IFRC's recovery efforts after the tsunami. Supporting the rebuilding of physical infrastructure, including 57,000 new homes, was one step, but establishing community based disaster risk management programs was equally important. Sea search and rescue teams were set up in Thailand, training was given to thousands of first-responders in Sri Lanka, and early warning systems -- using HF Radio -- were established across Indonesia alongside mangrove planting projects to reduce the impact of coastal flooding. The legacy of those initiatives lives on today. Improving communication . Community participation and engagement in risk reduction is vital and the tsunami cast a spotlight on the need to improve accountability and two-way communication with crisis affected communities. In Aceh, Indonesia, traditional and hi-tech approaches were used to enable people to raise questions or air concerns about the aid effort via community meetings, live radio and SMS. Such approaches have since become integral aspects of major operations and have proved essential in health promotion and social mobilization campaigns. Next year, the Third U.N. World Conference on Risk Reduction takes place in Japan where HFA 2 will take shape. This represents a unique opportunity to re-focus attention on the need for greater investment in community level disaster risk reduction. This means recognizing that local people and organizations are first responders in emergencies; understanding that they must be the drivers of change in their communities as they have the best understanding of the risks they face. It also means investing in strengthening the risk reduction capacities of local, city and regional authorities. While we can't prevent another tsunami, we do know that many people in harms way today are now more aware and better prepared to face future disasters. The challenge ahead remains how we align global and local action to safeguard future generations.","Lesson reinforced by tsunami is importance of investing in disaster risk reduction .

"(CNN) -- It's 06:30am and the sun has just risen over the bustling gardens of Mbuyoni elementary school, in the coastal city of Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. On this sunny morning, fits of giggles and screeches of laughter fill the hot and humid air, as would be expected in most schools around the world. But the source of fun is somewhat less expected -- farming. ""I like to grow blackjack, fame flower, pumpkin leaves and sweet potatoes,"" explains 11-year old Zulfa Mussa in her native language of Kiswahili. Mussa is new to the world of agriculture and has enjoyed cultivating her favorite crops this morning. ""I didn't know they were edible and now I know, I eat them."" In fact, she eats them for lunch, along with the rest of her school. Mussa's school is putting African traditions back on the menu in a new era of indigenous school meals. Plants native to her home country, Tanzania, are being harnessed as a result of an idea pioneered by people at the other end of the age spectrum -- retired women -- the Regent Estate Senior Women's Group (RESEWO). ""Modern people here in Tanzania associate indigenous food with poverty and being poor,"" says RESEWO founder Freda Chale, referring to the increasing popularity of fast food. Native plants such as blackjack, moringa, pumpkin, sweet potato and even the leaves of these latter two plants, have high nutritional and medicinal value. But, they're under-appreciated by the communities in which they grow, often dismissed as weeds. Setting new traditions . One afternoon in 2007, Chale invited her senior peers for tea which was made from the leaves in her garden. That day her mission to save gastronomic traditions began. And it began with children. ""We started working with schools to make sure youngsters grow up valuing these vegetables,"" says Fabia Schundia, a RESEWO founding member. The children learn by growing and cultivating the plants at school and go on to spread the word to their families and communities. ""They don't know most of the time, especially people living in towns."" The elementary school at Mbuyoni has over 1200 students, all of whom appear to have come in at the crack of dawn to tend eagerly to their crops. There are groups of children tilling land, whilst others collect water from the well or wander around with watering cans. A final few harvest leaves and roots to be eaten for lunch that day. This is the atmosphere every morning, I'm told. The garden spans one sixth of the school's land and began development over three years ago. The school also has a kitchen on site for immediate preparation of the freshly-plucked ingredients. ""In the morning session, normally we have time to clean the environment and take care of our garden,"" says school headmistress, Dorothy Malecela. She has seen the impact the garden has had on the general health and well-being of her pupils. ""It increased school enrollment and reduced dropout because the kids are happy to come in,"" she says. RESEWO currently works with 10 schools in Dar es Salaam, but hopes for the indigenous food movement to spread across the country. The need for improved nutrition . Among the 8 million children under five years old estimated to be living in Tanzania, 42 per cent are stunted and 16 per cent are underweight, according to UNICEF. Levels of anemia are also high, with rates as high as 41 per cent in adult women. One cause of this is the increasing reliance on staples such as maize and sweet potatoes. Another cause is that locals have been eating more food high in fat and sugars, such as burgers. Plants with higher nutritional value, including the leaves of the sweet potato plant, seem to have been forgotten. Improving diets is a national concern, but for the women at RESEWO, their goal is to get people appreciating the food directly under their nose. ""In the villages, most of these vegetables grow as weeds,"" says Schundia, who worries that people don't even seem to use them when they have nothing to eat. By raising awareness into growing indigenous plants, the team hope to get people harnessing these plants as year-round sources of food on their doorstep. It's all in the taste . As Schundia wanders around the community garden at the RESEWO headquarters, she eagerly shows the tens of vegetable varieties growing there, one of her favorite being the bitter leaf. ""You prepare it, wash it, cut it in small pieces, fry it and season it as you wish. It's very tasty."" The leaves can also be consumed in the form of tea. Utility and versatility appear to be commonplace. Furthermore, the leaves of a sweet potato plant are high in protein, fiber, and minerals such as iron. The more local blackjack plant also contains vitamins and minerals and has traditionally been used as medicine to overcome anemia. Insight into these plants, and many more, have been compiled into a recipe book put together in association with the slow food foundation for biodiversity, an Italian-based NGO promoting environmentally and culturally sustainable agriculture. The nutritional and medicinal value of indigenous plants is being forgotten across the continent and the slow food foundation now work in over 10,000 gardens in Africa, including RESEWO's headquarters. The movement to revamp and revitalize ancient plants has begun. It also appears to hold the secret to youth. As Schundia explains the health benefits of improved nutrition, she grins and asks: ""How old do you think I am?"" Without a wrinkle on her face and the energy of someone in their prime, she reveals she is 74 years old. Maybe that should be the opener to get anyone hooked. __________________________________________ . Soft Yams with Groundnut . Method: . 1. Wash yams thoroughly and peel.

"(CNN) -- If I'm pulled over by a police officer my first reaction is likely annoyance; it isn't fear. That's partly because I'm a former city of Atlanta police officer and served as a reserve police officer in Oxford, Mississippi, during my time on the faculty at the University of Mississippi's School of Law. I'm also a former assistant chief counsel (prosecutor) with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Many of my closest friends are in law enforcement. But, it is also, in large part, because I'm a middle-aged white guy. The killing of New York Police Officers Wenjian Liu and Rafael Ramos was a violent act of cowardice. Did it somehow make ""sense"" to Ismaaiyl Brinsley, the accused shooter? Did he believe he was avenging the deaths of Michael Brown and Eric Garner? Maybe. Probably. But to assign this incident any significance in the larger picture is pointless. We don't need to validate the terrible deed. What we need is to start an open and much needed discussion about relationships between the police and citizens in this country. ""No Justice, No Peace,"" is an often heard slogan at anti-police rallies. Anyone who believes in justice and peace cannot see Brinsley's alleged actions as anything but senseless murder that diverts us from finding solutions. What we need to do is find common ground. Our experiences shape our perceptions, which form our personal reality. As such, common ground in this context can be difficult. We each only have one set of experiences. An ""us against them"" attitude permeates both the police and many communities. Distrust is rampant on all sides. Can I understand what it is like to be African-American in the context of interacting with the police? No. But, if you haven't been a police officer you can't imagine what that job is like either. You frequently have to make split-second decisions. Along with the adrenaline, fear is part of the job. You never know what's going to happen to you. Is this an excuse? No. It is a call for better police training and more sensible (and more limited) laws to enforce in the first place. A great many ""police failings"" are more accurately described as political failings. Nonviolent protest about situations involving law enforcement is productive. Brinsley has no place in that discussion; his alleged actions should have no legacy other than our condemnation wherever we stand on the larger issues. The killing of two police officers in cold blood has no connection with the necessary review and scrutiny of law enforcement officers in specific incidents where transparency is crucial. The Declaration of Independence states that the government derives its power from the ""consent of the governed."" There is a deep chasm of trust, in many cases, between those who pass and enforce the laws and those who are subjected to them. This lack of trust has eroded the ""consent"" in many communities that often feel more occupied than served and protected by police. One Internet post believed to be from Brinsley read: ""I Rather Die a Gangster Then Go To Sleep A Coward."" He went to ""sleep"" a coward after allegedly committing two heinous killings. Any expression he intended was lost in the violence of what he did; as it should be. Moving forward, we have to figure out how to change the status quo. I believe that modern American police departments have overly embraced a ""militaristic"" (for lack of a better term) approach, in large part because of the endless war on drugs and the advent of the prison-industrial-complex where bed space is a commodity. An emphasis on, and promotional preference for (usually based on seniority) SWAT-modeled units, specialized units and investigation functions has led, in many cases, to the most inexperienced officers being the most likely to interact with citizens during the more stressful shifts. I favor body cameras on police officers because they can serve a valuable purpose not only to the citizens, but also to officers who will be exonerated from baseless claims against them. Far too many laws have led to far too many negative police-citizen interactions. U.S. Supreme Court precedent has created a framework where the subjective intent of the officer is irrelevant. Law enforcement would be best served if it strictly adheres to the Constitution, particularly the Bill of Rights. At the end of the day, police should focus on: To serve and protect and secure -- as in, protect the Fourth Amendment's right to be ""secure"" affirmatively instead of viewing it as a hindrance to their efforts as law enforcement professionals.","New York Police Officers Wenjian Liu and Rafael Ramos were shot dead .

"Six months after his death, radio personality Casey Kasem has finally found a resting place. The former host of ""American Top 40"" was buried December 16 at Vestre Gravlund, a cemetery in Oslo, Norway,  manager of cemetery administration Stein Olav Hohlen told CNN on Tuesday. But the burial has not calmed a long-running family feud. ""This morning my family and I learned that my Dad's abusive wife Jean Thompson Kasem and their daughter Liberty conned a cemetery in Norway into burying my Dad there,"" his daughter Kerri Kasem said on her Facebook page. ""Even with ALL the letters ... from my father's friends and family stating that he wanted to be buried in the UNITED STATES, the country in which he was born and raised, his wishes were, once again, ignored by his unfaithful wife."" Jean Kasem could not be reached for comment. Kasem's adult children from his first marriage and his wife of more than 30 years battled in court in the months before Kasem died June 15 at age 82. Kerri Kasem was given a conservatorship over her father's health, which Jean Kasem subsequently fought in court, claiming his children were prematurely ending their father's life. Before Kasem's death, Jean Kasem removed her ailing husband from a care facility in Santa Monica, California, and took him to stay at the home of family friends in Washington state. After Kasem died, family members complained they didn't know where the body was located. Danny Deraney, the publicist for Kerri Kasem, said last summer that Jean Kasem removed her husband's body from a funeral home in Washington. On Monday, he said, ""Clearly, the family is not happy and they understand that Jean can bury him wherever she wants, even if it is not what Casey wanted. But the kids  are at peace knowing that they got their Dad's final moments."" Kasem was already a popular disc jockey in Los Angeles when he became the host of ""American Top 40"" in 1970. The syndicated show, which counted down the 40 most popular songs in the United States based on Billboard magazine's Hot 100 music chart, began on just seven radio stations but quickly became a mainstay of thousands, all around the world. The show inspired imitators, including a television version, ""America's Top 10,"" that  Kasem hosted.","Fadio personality's wife, adult children have been battling in court .

"A tornado system touched down in portions of Mississippi on Tuesday afternoon, killing at least four people and leaving injuries, damage and power outages, said local authorities. Two people died in Jones County and two more in Marion County, said state Emergency Management Agency spokesman Brett Carr. ""Two people died inside their mobile home that was completely destroyed,"" said Jones County Sheriff Alex Hodge. ""This was in the rural part of Jones County. There were other brick and mortar homes that had major damage but we have no other injuries reported."" The mobile home was not part of a mobile home park but on a property by itself, clarified Hodge. In the town of Sumrall, west of Hattiesburg, a tornado hit a day care off Highway 42. ""Got it pretty good,"" said police spokesman Officer Nick Verner. Verner said all the children have been accounted for and there were no injuries. They were moved to a nearby bank. In Columbia, 27 miles southwest of Sumrall, the tornado damage appeared to be centered off Highway 98 near a Walmart, according to Marion County Emergency Management spokeswoman Megan Smith. Smith confirmed reports of injuries and damaged or destroyed cars and structures. ""Fifty patients were seen in the ER today because of the storm,"" said Marion General Hospital spokesperson Millie Swan. ""Eight of those were transported to Forest General Hospital in Hattiesburg because they needed a higher level of care. We are operating on generator power. Columbia is completely out of power."" Swan said most of the patients have been released. ""We may see more patients come in tomorrow though as search and rescue continues. Maybe someone who broke their ankle or something and has waited to come in,"" said Swan. About 6,300 households were without power, according to the Mississippi governor's office. Also in Marion County, a sheriff's department operator reported people trapped and injured as a result of a tornado touchdown. Authorities couldn't provide an exact number of people affected. Carr said multiple roads were closed due to damage including, Highway 13. In Jones County, the Mississippi Emergency Management Agency reported damaged homes and power outages. Hodge said there was major damage to a church, trees down and power lines down. ""Right now, the system is pretty much forming a diagonal line across the southeast corner of the state,"" said  spokesman Greg Flynn. ""There is a report that we have another one -- a tornado in Jones County near the City of Laurel. It was a dangerous system coming through."" Mississippi Gov. Phil Bryant issued a state of emergency for Marion and Jones counties, along with other parts of the state affected by severe weather. The same storm system destroyed about 15 homes outside Amite, Louisiana, 47 miles northeast of Baton Rouge, according to Tangipahoa Parish Emergency Management spokeswoman Vicki Travis. Photos obtained by CNN showed structures completely flattened. No injuries were reported in Tangipahoa, but 1,750 households did not have power. Flynn said the agency worked to prepare residents for the storm but the bad weather ""could not have come at a worst time of year."" ""People are out scrambling to get their last-minute Christmas shopping done. We have a lot of people moving around and traveling for the holidays. A lot of visitors that may not know where to go and what to do when the bad weather came through,"" said Flynn. The National Weather Service extended its tornado watch to include Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia and Florida. Winter storm . The tornado system compounded a rain-heavy storm that already soaked the area. ""You wouldn't think of December as a month which you would see severe weather,"" said CNN meteorologist Karen Maginnis. ""Actually, this is a secondary peak for tornado activity. The first is during the spring months, but we got very warm, moist unstable air that is going to unload quite a bit of heavy rainfall all across the southeast."" ""This is going to be very problematic -- not just for travelers, but now that the weather has turned very violent,"" said Maginnis. The National Weather Service warned that 2 to 4 inches of precipitation are expected, with 6 to 8 inches possible, in parts of Alabama, Georgia and north Florida by the time this storm rolls through. A flash-flood warning was issued for parts of Tallahassee on Tuesday evening, where over 6 inches of rain had fallen. The Northeast also experienced its share of weather woes on Tuesday. Travelers in Philadelphia were seeing average delays of almost two hours due to low clouds, the Federal Aviation Administration reported. Things weren't much better in Boston's airport and at LaGuardia and Newark Liberty airports in and around New York City. Lower gas prices, more weather headaches? A weather system spinning in the middle Mississippi River Valley is expected to move slowly toward the Great Lakes region. A weather system that formed in the Gulf of Mexico pushed moisture north, creating heavy rain and winds up to 30 mph in the Southeast, CNN meteorologist Michael Guy said. On the Gulf Coast, at least, these storms could be accompanied by large hail and possibly isolated tornadoes. All this wetness could make for treacherous driving on the I-95 corridor, which runs up the East Coast. And none of it is good news for the 98.6 million Americans that AAA projects will be going 50 or more miles this holiday season, a 4% increase from last year. They can take advantage of plummeting gas prices -- which, averaging $2.25 nationwide, are down 69 cents a gallon from a year ago. By Christmas Day, things should quiet down on the East Coast, with most of the moisture having moved into and past Canada. ""There may be a few lingering snow showers across the Western Appalachians and interior New England,"" he said. ""Winds will be strongest Christmas Eve night into Christmas morning for the Northeast as the front and system passes."" It's not just the East . The West will have its own travel problems, with precipitation forecast to hit the Northwest on Tuesday moving into the Rockies -- in the form of snow -- Christmas Day. The National Weather Service says snow is likely in Denver; Missoula, Montana; and Jackson, Wyoming.  Flight delays are possible in Minneapolis; St. Louis; and Omaha, Nebraska. Even Hawaii isn't immune, with flash flood watches in effect for all its main islands through Wednesday night due to heavy rains.","Four dead in two Mississippi counties as a result of storm .

"Samuel Yaga, a mechanic, was making a routine repair on a client's car when his phone rang. It was a phone call that would change his life forever. ""I was called in the morning by my elder brother notifying me of an attack on the school where my daughter was schooling,"" he said. Samuel's blood went cold as his brother continued, telling him that some of the girls had been abducted by Boko Haram. Samuel knew only too well the vicious and brutal nature of the terrorist group: just a few months before this, Boko Haram had attacked his village in northeastern Nigeria. Armed men forced him out of his house and one of them pointed a gun to his head. By a sheer miracle, unexplainable even to Samuel, one of the militants intervened, and his life was spared. Their entire village was razed to the ground and so Samuel moved his family to Chibok and enrolled his eldest daughter Sarah into the Government Secondary School so that she could sit for her final high school exam. He chose Chibok because not only was it his ancestral home and he had relatives there but also because it had no history of Boko Haram attacks. He felt it was safe -- until now. Later in the day Samuel's brother phoned him again. ""Then before sunset he called me again, and informed me that my daughter was part of those that were taken by Boko Haram."" His wife Rebecca says the news of her daughter's abduction tore at her heart. She refused to believe it when her husband first told it to her -- until it was confirmed on the evening news. ""Seriously, seriously, mum and her daughter. The pain is indescribable,"" she reflects. Rebecca says there is not a day that goes by that she does think of her daughter. She describes her daughter as an ambitious girl who saw education as a way out of poverty. ""She used to tell me one day she will finish school and become somebody. She used to assist the younger ones with their homework,"" she said . ""She loved studies. She used to fall asleep with her books in her arms,"" she added. Her father remembers her as the caring eldest child who used to secretly collect his dirty clothes, wash them and press them for him. He also remembers her passion for knowledge. ""She is brilliant. She liked reading. Always she loved going to school,"" he said. Inside their small one roomed house -- there is nothing to indicate that the Christmas festive season has begun. They say Christmas used to be a time of laughter and spending time with family. ""Every Christmas we used to be complete and happy but now one of us is not there, how can it be the same?"" asks Samuel. ""There is nothing I can say. It has happened. It is a bad Christmas. But there is nothing we can do,"" says Rebecca. A sadness surrounds the couple as they clutch to the only physical memory that they have of their daughter -- a few photos and one bright green top, one of her favorites. But although they are at low spirits, they say their hopes remain high that their daughter will come back. They pass on that encouragement to their other five children who say they miss their sister. ""Her siblings know that she is not here -- they themselves know what is happening, having come out of war,"" says Samuel. ""They keep asking me, 'When is she coming back?' But I keep telling them to keep trusting God. Maybe He will hear us,"" he adds.","Samuel and Rebecca Yaga's daughter Sarah was kidnapped by Boko Haram in Chibok .

"A protest against racism and police violence packed sidewalks in New York on Tuesday, despite calls from the city's mayor for a pause in demonstrations. As they marched past shops on the city's storied Fifth Avenue, some protesters chanted ""Hey-hey, ho-ho. These racist cops have got to go"" and ""How do you spell racist? N-Y-P-D.""; others carried signs saying ""Jail killer cops"" and ""Stop the war on Black America."" Mayor Bill de Blasio had asked for the demonstrations to stop until after funerals for two police officers who were slain over the weekend in Brooklyn. But organizers of Tuesday's protest said there was no reason to ""give in to hysteria"" and call off the march. At first, marchers stayed on the sidewalks as a large police presence, with officers -- some wearing riot helmets and face shields -- keeping protesters from impeding holiday traffic. Eventually, the demonstration spilled into the streets. The protest came hours after a moment of silence at New York's City Hall at 2:47 p.m., three days to the minute since a gunman ambushed New York Police Department Officers Rafael Ramos and Wenjian Liu. ""There's a lot of pain right now that we have to work our way through,"" de Blasio said. ""We have to keep working to bring police and community together. We have to put the divisions of the past behind us."" The mayor repeated his calls for the city to focus on the families of the fallen officers. ""Please embrace those around you as a symbol of our belief that we will move forward together,"" he said after marking the moment when two officers were shot in an ambush. Buildings and landmarks on the New York skyline -- including the Empire State and Chrysler buildings, One World Trade Center and 30 Rockefeller Plaza -- were set to dim their lights for five minutes Tuesday night in honor of slain officers. Mourners flock to memorial . De Blasio and his wife were among the mourners who stopped Tuesday by a memorial at the site where the officers were killed, looking at flowers and an American flag hanging on the wall of a building. Also drawn to the street memorial: the daughter of Eric Garner. ""It was important to me, because in the case of my dad, people came out and they supported us. I just felt really saddened by it, because a young kid lost their father like I did,"" Emerald Garner told CNN's ""AC360."" Protesters have been pushing for a peaceful response, she said. And pushing for change, she said, doesn't mean they're anti-police. ""Not all cops are bad,"" she said. ""We've just got to salute the good ones and weed out the bad ones."" The gunman who killed the officers ignored their message and ""took it upon himself to take negative actions,"" she said. ""It's ugly and it's very tragic,"" Garner said. ""I don't want anybody to die. There shouldn't be any more bloodshed. Nobody needs to lose their life in a senseless way."" The backlash . De Blasio has come under fire since the shooting, facing criticism that he's fanned tensions between the public and police. Authorities haven't established the gunman's motive, but they've noted that Ismaaiyl Brinsley, 28, broadcast his plans to kill police on social media. And in some of his posts, investigators have said, he mentioned the controversial cases of Michael Brown and Eric Garner, African-American men who were killed by police. Since Saturday's shooting, critics have taken aim at de Blasio's earlier comments supporting protesters who've voiced their concerns about the case of Garner, a 43-year-old who died in July after police in Staten Island placed him in what appeared to be a chokehold. A wave of protests erupted in New York City -- and nationwide -- after the officer involved was not indicted. The head of New York's police union said de Blasio had ""blood on his hands."" And, in the aftermath of Saturday's shootings, video showed officers turning their backs on the mayor as he walked through a hospital. Organizers of Tuesday's protest in New York accused some leaders of manipulating the situation. ""This is a misguided response to the current situation and is meant to chill the expression of free speech rights,"" the ANSWER Coalition said in a statement. ""Representatives of police unions are taking advantage of and seizing upon the actions of a lone, troubled individual who shot his ex-girlfriend and then killed two police officers in Brooklyn to smear, discredit and end the broad social movement that has demanded accountability, an end to police misconduct and police violence."" Police seeking help . Police are asking the public's help to piece together how the gunman who killed the two officers spent two hours before the slayings. Brinsley, who ranted against the government and law enforcement on social media, ambushed and shot to death Ramos and Liu as they sat in their patrol car at about 2:45 p.m. Saturday in the Brooklyn neighborhood of Bedford-Stuyvesant. Police have said Brinsley started his day in Baltimore, where he shot and seriously wounded his ex-girlfriend at her apartment in the early morning and then took a Bolt bus to New York. Police Commissioner William Bratton told reporters that investigators believe the gunman acted alone, but he said that police still need a full understanding of Brinsley's actions. ""We owe it to the families to find out what happened,"" Bratton said. ""That's why we're seeking to build this case up, so we know going forward exactly who talked to this man.""","Eric Garner's daughter: Gunman ignored protesters' peaceful message .

"John McCain is still angry. But soon, he'll have power and an old enemy, President Barack Obama, is already in his sights. In the latest redemptive twist of a career of political and personal ups and downs, the Arizona Republican senator will take on one of the most weighty jobs in Congress when the new Republican majority rolls into town next month. As Chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, McCain will hold the White House to account for what he sees as a feckless foreign policy that has enabled ""genocide"" in Syria, left ""evil"" to fill a leadership vacuum elsewhere and splintered America's moral example around the world. ""History judges people by what is accomplished or is not accomplished, whether there has been victory or defeat, that is the ultimate judgment,"" McCain said when asked by CNN to rate Obama's record as a statesman. ""I think you could argue that the world is vastly changed and it certainly is not to the benefit of democracy, freedom or America's role in the world."" McCain's new post is an unexpected coda for a turbulent life in which he was tortured as a Vietnam prisoner-of-war, emerged from a savings and loan scandal as a campaign finance champion and was a maverick who beat cancer and dubbed adoring reporters on his campaign bus his ""base."" Now, from his perch on Armed Services, McCain will be back where he is happiest, where the political fight is at its most intense. He has a chance to reshape his own legacy, and ensure that the last word on his political career is not two losing presidential campaigns and his pick of running mate Sarah Palin, who critics blasted as unqualified to be a heartbeat away from the presidency. Top Obama aides will soon find themselves trooping up to Capitol Hill for inquisitions before his committee. McCain is promising to use the power of the purse to force Obama's hand on key issues including Ukraine and Syria. McCain also wants to end sequester budget cuts he says are stifling the military and cost overruns that plague the Pentagon's procurement process. He's planning to form a powerful triumvirate with Sen. Bob Corker, incoming chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and Sen. Richard Burr, the new head of the Intelligence Committee, to drive the foreign policy agenda. Confrontation . He's planning to confront the White House on Syria, Ukraine, Iran nuclear talks, the struggle against ISIS and the President's decision to establish diplomatic ties with communist Cuba. Republicans are also expected to use funding bills for government departments to constrain administration foreign policy in some areas and to target it in others, in effect daring Obama to veto wider bills that include elements he might oppose. In the six years since Obama beat him in the presidential race, McCain has been seething from the sidelines, prompting some to caricature him as an ""angry old man"" squandering a reputation for heroism and integrity. It's been an odd kind of political purgatory, since it's rare there's a day he's not on cable TV. McCain has also had some victories, helping torpedo Obama's preferred pick for secretary of state, Susan Rice, and ridiculing White House political appointees for ambassadorial posts, including a soap opera producer dispatched to Hungary. OPINION: John McCain's political comeback . But he has been unable to change the substance of Obama's foreign policy. The President has ignored McCain's calls for the United States to align much more closely with moderate rebels in the cauldron of Syria's civil war. His hawkish recommendations on confronting Vladimir Putin have also gone unheard. His searing criticism did not stop Obama pulling out of Iraq, though Republicans claim vindication following the rise of ISIS. But McCain will come out of the wilderness in January. In the interview, he decried a ""vacuum created by the lack of American leadership which has been filled in by evil influences."" ""Countries no longer believe in American leadership, so therefore, they are making their own accommodations, not only in the Middle East but also in what used to be eastern Europe,"" he said. It's a worldview reflected on the walls of McCain's Senate conference room, which features letters and photos from the likes of Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher, leaders who drew firm ideological lines and didn't suffer critics gladly. At times, McCain's moral outrage over Syria or Ukraine seems to burst out of him and contrasts with the cold-eyed realism of a President who believes he was elected to end wars, not to get into new quagmires. 'Immoral' ""We are watching one of the great episodes of genocide certainly in our century,"" McCain said, when asked to assess Obama's Syria policy. ""Two hundred thousand people dead, 3.5 million refugees, 150,000 still languishing in (Syrian leader) Bashar al-Assad's prisons."" He added: ""We have basically sat by and done very little ... what we are doing is not only unworkable, it's immoral."" Democrats see McCain as the embodiment of a Republican reflex to respond to every global problem with military force, which led America into misadventures like the war in Iraq. Some Obama aides also believe McCain never truly accepted his loss in 2008, and see him as now more interested in political fireworks than serious legislating. Obama clearly had the likes of McCain on his mind when he mounted a defense of his foreign policy with CNN's Candy Crowley on Sunday. ""There is this knee jerk sense on the part of some of the foreign policy establishment that shooting first and thinking about it second projects strength. I disagree with that,"" Obama said. Prospective Republican presidential candidate Rand Paul, fighting claims he is an isolationist, meanwhile said at a Wall Street Journal forum this month that McCain wants 15 more wars. In recent months, McCain's fury has spilled out in committee hearing showdowns with top officials including Secretary of State John Kerry and his new deputy, Tony Blinken. ""It's too bad you can't answer straightforward questions, Mr. Blinken,"" McCain said in an interrogation which angered allies of the popular White House official. McCain also lacerated Chuck Hagel, a fellow veteran of Vietnam and the Senate, who stumbled through a notorious confirmation hearing last year on the way to becoming Defense Secretary. People who know McCain are not at all shocked he's still trading punches and not walking off into the Arizona sunset after a lifetime of service. He often notes that his father and grandfather died soon after retirement and doesn't plan to make the same mistake. ""It doesn't surprise me at all. He has always been someone to run to the sound of the guns, and be in the arena where important decisions are being made,"" said Richard Fontaine, who worked for McCain for five years as a foreign policy adviser. But at 78, and uncertain whether Republicans can hold their majority in 2016, there is a certain poignancy to McCain. 'Running out of time' ""I'm running out of time,"" he snapped last month,  cutting off Kerry in a five minute Foreign Relations Committee Q&A, offering a metaphor for a career approaching its final act with much left to say and do. There's also the question of his own Arizona Senate seat which tops the list for Tea Party insurgents looking for Republican scalps. McCain says he's close to announcing a run for a sixth term in 2016 -- which would take him through to age 86 -- and expects a tough fight. Former NATO ambassador Kurt Volker, who now runs Arizona State University's McCain Institute, says the senator is simply not done fighting. ""He has a strong sense of values and character,"" Volker said. ""His book 'Character is Destiny' is all about how character determines a person and determines events. He continues to want to fight for what needs to be done. He is unrelenting."" That streak of idealism underpins some of McCain's most admired political achievements -- for example his role in normalizing diplomatic relations with Vietnam, which required an embrace of a nation which incarcerated him. It was on display again this month when, with the moral authority of a torture victim, he was a rare Republican to back a report outlining harsh interrogation methods. ""The truth is sometimes a hard pill to swallow,"" McCain said on the floor. ""It sometimes causes us difficulties at home and abroad. It is sometimes used by our enemies in attempts to hurt us. But the American people are entitled to it nonetheless."" The speech won near universal praise, especially from liberals. ""Breathtaking,"" said Vice President Joe Biden. Daily Show host Jon Stewart quipped: ""Good McCain"" — ""I've missed you so much. I didn't think I would ever see you again."" McCain's intervention was a reminder that for all his talk of history ultimately only crediting winners, he may be remembered as much for how he fought for his beliefs as what he achieved. Few people know McCain as well as Kerry, who endured another tongue lashing from his old sparring partner in November. ""I believe in John's adage that a fight not joined is a fight not enjoyed,"" Kerry said.","McCain to challenge Obama foreign policy in new Senate post .

"(CNN) -- First it was Mario Gotze. Now Robert Lewandowski is leaving Borussia Dortmund for German powerhouse Bayern Munich. The sought after Polish international signed a five-year contract with Bayern Munich, Bayern said on its website while calling the 25-year-old one of the ""world's top strikers."" He'll join the Bavarian outfit at the end of the season, when his current deal with Dortmund was due to expire. ""We are very happy that this transfer has gone through,"" Bayern CEO Karl-Heinz Rummenigge said. ""Robert Lewandowski is one of the world's top strikers. ""He will not only strength our squad, but his arrival will also give the entire club a boost."" Some would say Bayern hardly needs it, since it won five trophies in 2013 and is on pace to cruise to yet another Bundesliga crown. Lewandowski co leads the Bundesliga in scoring this campaign with 11 goals and has netted 91 times in 165 games for Borussia Dortmund since joining from Poland's Lech Poznan for a bargain basement $7 million in 2010. His goals also helped Borussia Dortmund reach last season's Champions League final, although Bayern Munich came out on top in London. Gotze's move to Bayern Munich was announced last April while he still played for Borussia Dortmund and the German international became a highly unpopular figure among many Dortmund fans -- so Lewandowski might expect some jeers himself. Lewandowski's impending departure is a further blow to Dortmund. The German champion in 2011 and 2012 -- Lewandowski played a key role -- Jurgen Klopp's side has slipped to a distant fourth in the league and narrowly advanced to the second round of this season's Champions League.","Bayern Munich signs striker Robert Lewandowski from Borussia Dortmund .

"One victim is dead and five others are hospitalized after the latest in a string of attacks that sparked fears in France, authorities said Tuesday. Prime Minister Manuel Valls announced Tuesday the country is boosting security with up to 300 additional security forces. A 25-year-old man died from his injuries suffered Monday night in Nantes, when a van plowed into shoppers at an outdoor Christmas market, Nantes prosecutor Brigitte Lamy said. In addition to the five victims hospitalized, the driver is as well, Lamy said. The driver stabbed himself twice after the incident, but is expected to survive, said Pierre-Henry Brandet, a spokesman for France's Interior Ministry. An investigation for murder and attempted murder has been opened. Officials have said the incident appears to be an isolated case and not an act of terrorism.  But it came after two other incidents in which the perpetrators were reported to have been yelling ""God is great"" in Arabic at the time of their attacks. One took place Sunday in Dijon, in which a man rammed his vehicle into pedestrians, injuring at least 12, police said.  A man has been arrested in connection with the case. CNN affiliate BFM-TV reported that eyewitnesses heard the driver shout the phrase ""Allahu Akbar."" On Saturday, a man stabbed three police officers in central France while allegedly calling out the same phrase. French counterterrorism authorities are investigating that attack. CNN terrorism analyst Paul Cruickshank reported that the attacker behind Sunday's incident was a ""40-year-old French-North African with a long history of psychiatric problems,"" and the perpetrator of Sunday's attack was a 20-year-old French-Burundian who had posted the ISIS flag on his Facebook page. Police haven't revealed any possible motives. France's Prime Minister has said his country has never faced as serious a terrorism threat as it does now. ""There is in France ... a terrorist threat,"" Valls said Tuesday. ""We want to protect and reassure the French and tell them that all state services are mobilized,"" Valls said, adding, ""In these times of crisis, we must act with knowledge, judgment and self-control."" Crowded shopping and tourist areas are already being patrolled by about 780 soldiers, and those numbers were being by another 200 to 300 Tuesday, he said. ""We will not offer the victory of fear to those who want to weaken our democracy,"" the Prime Minister said. European officials tell CNN the threat of terrorist attack in the European Union is greater than at any time since 9/11 because of the emergence of jihadist safe havens in Syria and Iraq, Cruickshank wrote for CNN.com.  ""But no country faces a greater terrorist threat than France, with support for ISIS running deep among disenfranchised immigrant communities in the rundown, crime-ridden banlieues (suburbs) that surround many French towns.""","A man died from a Monday attack in France, prosecutor says .

"(CNN) -- As Christmas arrives, eyes turn naturally toward Bethlehem, where the Prince of Peace was supposedly born just over 2,000 years ago. Countless Christians -- some devout, others wedded to force of habit -- arrive at a vast array of churches that represent one of the thousands of known denominations. Indeed, the World Christian Encyclopedia suggests that over 33,820 denominations can be identified in almost 200 countries. That's a lot of splintering over two millennia! Still, it's difficult to keep in mind that Christmas is a religious and not a shopping thing, and retailers deck the halls with whatever it takes to draw you in: candy canes, evergreen wreaths, mangers, images of Santa, Frosty the Snowman, you name it. The loudspeakers in malls throb with lousy holiday Muzak: ""Sleigh bells ring. Are you listenin?"" In fact, Christmas is as much a secular event as a spiritual one, a civil holiday that accounts for over 19% of yearly retail sales; that translated to $3 trillion in sales last year. For purveyors of goods, there is every reason to believe in Christmas. But what do Christians who take their religion seriously really think about Christmas? Most of them, I suspect, don't think about it much. They enjoy the lead-up to the day itself -- the sense of expectation -- in the month before Christmas, a time known as Advent, with its special hymns and prayers. The rhythms of the so-called Church Year are heavily dependent on Christmas, with the 25th of December as a peak of sorts -- a moment of hope that comes at the darkest time of the year, not incidentally related to winter solstice, a calendar moment when the day is shortest, the night longest, at least in the Northern Hemisphere. In fact, midwinter festivals, including Saturnalia and Dies Natalis Solis Invicti, were broadly celebrated in ancient Rome. In ancient Egypt, there was a festival that marked the birth of a child sun-god, Horus, whose mother (called Isis) was a virgin. Indeed, this child was ""laid in a manger,"" one of many similarities with the Christmas story. Scholars have been all over this, going back to one of the earliest Christian writers, St. Epiphanius of Salamis, who noted the similarities. (The details of this connection will be found in a recent book by Barbara G. Walker and D.M. Murdock, ""Man Made God: A Collection of Essays"".) There is just no doubt that ancient cultures felt a strong need to proclaim the season of a new ""sun,"" the start of the fresh agricultural and astrological season that signaled hope ""in the bleak midwinter,"" as the beautiful Christian hymn puts it well. But the earliest Christian writer, the Apostle Paul, whose writings precede the four Gospels by decades, seems never to have heard of Christmas. Although his many famous letters occupy a large space in the New Testament, Paul fails to mention even once the manger in Bethlehem, the hovering star, the wise men, angels keeping watch over their flocks by night, Joseph and Mary on the run -- anything that we normally associate with this major church festival. Why is this? Was the early Christian church wholly unaware of the origins of Jesus? It's worth noting that the earliest of the gospels, Mark, makes no mention whatsoever of Christmas. Nor does the fourth Gospel, John, where the only vague allusion to the origins of Jesus occurs in the opening hymn, where we read: ""In the beginning was the Word."" No manger, no hovering star. Nothing but this haunting mystical Greek hymn about ""the Word,"" which in Greek is logos, one of the least translatable of Greek words and one that I would myself translate as ""understanding."" But there was, among early Christian gatherings, a strong need to have a myth of origins, a story about the beginnings of the man who ultimately became the Messiah, the Christ. Probably drawing on Persian myths, Matthew and Luke came up with Christmas stories that have almost nothing in common. They can't be reconciled, in fact. In Matthew, we get the three kings. We get Herod the Great issuing an order that all children under a certain age should be killed. We get Jesus being whisked away by his parents to Egypt, where he remains in hiding until it's safe to return. In Luke we get a kinder and gentler Christmas, with no wise men, no mean Herod, no flight to Egypt. Instead, we get the shepherds keeping a watch over their flocks by night. As any Jewish male would, if born to devout parents, the baby Jesus was taken to the great Temple in Jerusalem to be circumcised. It's a lovely story. Christians didn't celebrate Christmas in the first two centuries. In fact, the major early writers of Christianity fail to mention the holiday at all, and one of them -- Origen of Alexandria -- actually made fun of birth celebrations, regarding such anniversaries as a pagan practice. It wasn't until the middle of the fourth century that almanacs began to list Christmas as a celebration. As Christianity moved into Western Europe, the idea of Advent as a major season that culminated in Christmas obviously caught on. It linked to various local traditions, in Germany and Scandinavia and elsewhere. There were old Celtic celebrations associated with the winter solstice that connected to the idea of ""Yule,"" which means ""Wheel of the Year,"" and these ceremonial occasions involved the burning of a ""Yule log."" Brightly decorated trees were also part of the celebration, and this obviously carried over into Christian practices. The great success of Christianity in the world had much to do with its ability to assimilate earlier religious traditions wherever it was transplanted, and the Christmas season must be considered a melange of many ancient and meaningful practices. But one must never forget that Christians themselves -- and I am one of them -- consider this a holy time, a time of spiritual renewal, a time of the year when darkness opens to the possibility of light. Whatever the specifics of his birth, Jesus became the Light of the World for those who follow his path. He is, indeed, the Prince of Peace, and he invites us to a change of heart, a way of overcoming violence in the world with love and grace. This is the Good News that the gospel writers proclaimed.","Jay Parini: In the retail rush of Christmas, people don't ponder where holiday came from .

"A billionaire who jointly controlled Asia's biggest property development company and a man who was once Hong Kong's second-ranked official were sentenced to prison for conspiracy to commit misconduct in one of the city's most significant corruption trials. Tycoon Thomas Kwok received a five year sentence Tuesday, and former chief secretary Rafael Hui got seven and a half years, after having been found guilty by a Hong Kong high court jury last week. Kwok was also ordered to pay a $64,453 fine and $1.6 million in costs to the prosecution, while Hui was ordered to pay the Hong Kong government $1.4 million, equivalent to the amount of bribes taken. The main question during their trial was whether Kwok and his younger brother, Raymond Kwok, had bought the allegiance of Hui when he was in public office, in offenses spanning nearly a decade. The brothers, ranked 86th on the 2014 Forbes list of the world's richest people, were co-chairs of the developer giant Sun Hung Kai, which is responsible for many of Hong Kong's most iconic skyscrapers. The jury found the older Kwok, 63, guilty of the charge of conspiracy to commit misconduct, for having bribed Hui between 2005 and 2007. Raymond Kwok was cleared of all charges. In Hong Kong, the maximum penalty for misconduct and conspiracy for misconduct is seven years in prison and an unlimited fine. In passing sentence, Judge Andrew Macrae said he had discounted a year of imprisonment from Kwok's sentence to reflect his philanthropic work. Kwok is also prohibited from serving as director of a company for five years. Last week, he resigned from his position at Sun Hung Kai, and his son, Adam Kwok, was named the company's next executive director. In a sentencing hearing Monday, Kwok's lawyer Clare Montgomery said her client was a man of good character with no previous convictions. She added that the conspiracy to commit misconduct charge related only to a short period of time and the court could not say whether or not he was the leader of that conspiracy. Montgomery also added that imprisonment would be a burden on his wife and his 86-year-old mother, who is in poor health. Ex-city official convicted . Hui, 66, is the highest-ranking former official to be tried in Hong Kong. The court looked into whether Hui received monetary and housing benefits from the Kwoks in return for government decisions favorable to the company. The charges related to accepting rent-free apartments, unsecured loans and a consultancy agreement with the property company. The jury found him guilty on three counts of misconduct in a public office, conspiracy to commit misconduct in public office and conspiracy to offer an advantage to a public servant. Judge Macrae said that, as the instigator of the corruption, Hui should receive the harsher sentence. The judge said that, had he not committed the offending, Hui may have been the finest chief secretary in the territory's recent history. He said the offending did nothing to dispel the perception in Hong Kong that government and business leaders were ""cozying up."" The jury also found Thomas Chan, who was responsible for land acquisition at the company and Francis Kwan, a former Hong Kong Stock Exchange official, guilty of making a series of payments to Hui. During the sentencing hearing yesterday, Hui's defence lawyer Edwin Choy read out a mitigation letter from the former chief executive of Hong Kong, Donald Tsang. In his letter, Tsang said: ""I was devastated when the jury found him guilty."" The former leader of Hong Kong described Hui as an ""extraordinary"" and ""outstanding person"". He also called on the judge to take into account Hui's contribution to the city's economy, including his role in protecting Hong Kong during the Asian financial crisis in 1997. The case caused a media frenzy in the city, where real estate is a local obsession. Sun Hung Kai, which helped to build some of the tallest buildings in the city's celebrated skyline, contributed to the Kwok brothers' estimated $18.3 billion fortune. Hong Kong, a special administrative region of China, is considered to be one of the world's least corrupt territories. According to Transparency International's 2013 Corruptions Perceptions Index, Hong Kong is the 15th least corrupt territory in the world -- with the United States, by comparison, ranked 19th.","Billionaire Thomas Kwok sentenced to five years on misconduct charge .

"New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio took on the role of the consoler on Tuesday in the wake of the weekend's shooting of two New York police officers, following in the footsteps of many before him that have had to knit the city back together following tragedy. De Blasio, accompanied by his wife, laid flowers at the memorial set up for officers Rafael Ramos and Wenjian Liu in Brooklyn near where they were shot as they sat in their patrol car. Later Tuesday, de Blasio offered hugs to the city's residents and a moment of silence for the two officers at City Hall, and urged the city to focus on the families of the slain officers and work to move forward. ""There's a lot of pain right now. We have to work our way through that pain. We have to keep working to bring police and community closer together,"" he said. ""We have to work for that more perfect union. We have to put the divisions of the past behind us."" The Tuesday show of sympathy marks a tightrope walk for the mayor as he navigates the simmering tensions of a police force that has eyed him warily from day one of his tenure — and now feels he's contributed to the atmosphere that caused the weekend's shooting — by showing support for protesters in the city. The head of the city's police union went so far as to say, following the shooting, that there's blood on the hands of those who have supported the protesters and it ""starts on the steps of city hall in the office of the mayor."" And police officers turned their backs on de Blasio this weekend as he entered the hospital where the bodies of the officers lay. He also faces frustration from his progressive base as well, which helped elect him on a platform of police reform and has increased calls for action in the wake of the recent killings of two unarmed African-American men at the hands of white police officers. Despite de Blasio's attempts to focus on the victims and call to ""put aside"" protests and politics until after their funerals, tensions remained high Tuesday. Critics kept up the drumbeat against him, and protesters pledged to continue their planned demonstrations despite de Blasio's request. The ANSWER Coalition, a protest group in New York City, said de Blasio's call for a hiatus to the protests was ""misguided"" and ""meant to chill the expression of free speech rights."" ""Instead of remaining silent, it is all the more important for people around the country to stay active and demand an end to the epidemic of police violence that is ravaging black and Latino communities throughout the United States,"" the statement said, noting that a protest planned for Tuesday evening would go on. And former New York Gov. George Pataki, a Republican, accused de Blasio of ""demonizing"" the NYPD with his previous expression of support for protesters in the city, and called for him to apologize. RELATED: Poll says de Blasio popular in NYC before cop shooting . ""He should meet with the police leaders and he should apologize. Apologize for not having their back when this crisis began and apologize for having helped create this climate where the best police department ... in America is demonized as being an occupying force,"" he told Newsmax. Outside of New York City, however, many of the nation's political leaders remained silent on the controversy. President Barack Obama issued a statement this weekend via the White House press office and called the Philadelphia and New York police commissioners, but has yet to appear on camera to address the situation. On Tuesday, he went vacation round of golf. White House spokesman Eric Schultz said on Tuesday Obama had asked Vice President Joe Biden to attend Saturday's service for officer Ramos. ""The President ... is grateful that the vice president and Jill Biden will be traveling to New York City to attend the service on Saturday,"" he said. Republicans largely avoided the issue as well. Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul, who's been a leading voice in the GOP pushing for criminal justice reform and the demilitarization of the police, took to Twitter to celebrate Festivus on Tuesday, but made no mention of the shooting. New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, another expected presidential contender, dodged a question on whether de Blasio was to blame for an anti-police atmosphere in New York City, saying in an interview it's not the time for politics.","New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio sought to console the city following this weekend's shootings .

"They met a daring cliff jumper. They followed the path of religious pilgrims. They negotiated with a road-blocking elephant. And then a team of Australia-based cinematophers on a two-week road trip through Sri Lanka produced a three-minute memoir of their trip that ranks as the most ""I wanna go there!"" videos we've seen in a while. ""We all have Sri Lankan backgrounds and as we were growing up, we heard many stories from our parents about their childhoods in Sri Lanka,"" says Rukshan Fernando, co-founder of  Melbourne-based Ferndara Creative and Creative Motion Cinematography. Together with Ferndara co-founder Chamik Bandara and assistant Niha Sathasivam, the team has traveled often to Sri Lanka to film destination weddings for private clients. But they'd never ventured beyond the tourist areas or towns in which they were paid to film. On their latest trip, however, the group decided to hop in a minivan and go on a ""very spontaneous and completely unplanned trip."" ""We decided that for this work trip, we would set aside some time for ourselves to experience what life in Sri Lanka is like,"" says Fernando. They got that and more -- as the video above illustrates -- as Fernando explained to CNN. CNN: What are your favorite scenes in the video? Rukshan Fernando: The elephants on the road is an interesting scene [0:20]. Some of the wild elephants in Sri Lanka are accustomed to blocking the road until they're fed. Feeding wild animals is not permitted, but many people will throw food for the elephants so they eat and move on. Another scene is the man cliff-jumping [0:22, 1:58], which was breathtaking and frightening at the same time. He jumped with such ease then climbed back up the cliff without any support and was ready to jump again. CNN: What's the cliff jumper's story? Fernando: The cliff-jumping scene was shot at Galle Fort near the Galle Lighthouse. He introduced himself as Red -- short for Reddog, his family name. According to Red, he makes a living out of it and has been doing the jumps for a very long time now. He jumps off the cliff for the amusement of tourists, usually for a small fee, around 1,000 rupees ($7). There's a rock that juts out so the jump has to be precise, adding to the suspense. CNN: Who's the solo dancer at the beginning and end of the video? Fernando: She's Miurangana Fernando, a 23-year-old who has been dancing for 10 years. Fernando's an accomplished dancer and dance instructor in the seaside town of Wennapuwa who has completed her arangetram (an important stage debut). We featured her at the start and end, performing Tanze (Uda Rata Natum) Ves Tanz ""Ves"" dance, the classical Sri Lankan Kandyan dance from the hill city, Kandy. CNN: What's the great looking festival that pops up? Fernando: At almost the one-minute mark an elephant adorned in fancy garments is paraded through the street for Kataragama Peraphera. This is one of the biggest celebrations in Sri Lanka and a pilgrimage for Sri Lankans. Thousands of people show up, some walking for days to make it to Kataragama, which was a major capital of an ancient kingdom called Ruhuna. We filmed on the final night, which included performances by up to 50 separate dance troupes, highlighting various dance traditions in Sri Lanka. CNN: How about the tea plantations? Fernando: The tea plantations are in Nuwara Eliya, a two- to thee-hour drive from Colombo. The region is the premium tea plantation area due to its cold, foggy climate. They actually belong to different companies that have been around since the British colonial period, with only little stumps and markers separating different plantations. It has a very European and colonial feel, and used to be called Little England. CNN: Any tips for photographing Sri Lanka? Fernando: Smile. If you smile at someone when filming them, this usually puts them at ease. Sri Lankans are very welcoming and tolerant, usually they have no issue with being filmed or photographed. It's also appreciated if you show them the photographs or clips. This might lead to further opportunities to film more closely or do a re-take of something important you may have missed. CNN: What were the challenges? Fernando: The best way to get around is driving, but the roads aren't well developed in some areas. There's lengthy travel time even for short distances. Unexpected traffic also causes missed moments like sunsets or sunrises.

"Senior executives and a team of medical staff from a Chinese hospital in the northwestern province of Shaanxi have been punished for taking group photos next to apparently unconscious patients after surgery, state media reported on Monday. A series of photos recently circulated on Sina Weibo, a Chinese microblogging site, shows Chinese doctors and nurses decked in scrubs, posing with reportedly unconscious patients on the operating table in the operating theater. A man makes a V-sign in one of the happy snaps, while other doctors are seen leaning over the patient mid-procedure. The Xi'an Bureau of Public Health has taken action for the photos taken in August this year, removing three top executives from administrative duties at the privately-run Fengcheng Hospital, reported Xinhua News Agency. The other staff pictured in the photos have been reprimanded and docked three months' pay. The hospital issued a public statement and apology, explaining that the photos were taken to commemorate the last day that the operating theater was in use, before it closed down in favor of new facilities. ""Our staff members have neglected the possible negative consequences of their actions, we will undergo an in depth review of the incident,"" the statement reads. The photos have triggered a backlash on China's microblogging platforms. Bloggers have taken to social media to express their opinions using the hashtag ""surgery selfie"", with many condemning the doctors' lack of professional ethics. ""They are not acting professionally at all. They are treating the patients' suffering as a joke, how can they even take a selfie at a time like this?"" one Weibo user, Penny Zhutou, commented on a discussion thread. Others expressed sympathy for the doctors. ""Doctors are humans too. I don't think there is anything wrong with them wanting to take a photo to celebrate after a long and successful surgery. We should look at this rationally, instead of being limited by those so-called restrictions,"" another Weibo user, ""Diaolinghoucanque"" commented.","Chinese doctors have been punished for taking pictures with unconscious patients .

"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN)  -- People in southern California dropped simultaneously to ground Thursday morning, huddled under tables and held on for about a minute in what is being billed as the largest earthquake drill in history. A researcher shows how shock waves of a 7.8-magnitude earthquake would fan across California. More than 5 million people registered to participate in the drill. It was part of the weeklong Great Southern California ShakeOut, a series of events organized by scientists and emergency officials to prepare people for a major earthquake, something scientists and researchers think is overdue in the area. Most participants -- whether in classrooms, offices or homes -- were expected to take cover under tables or desks and hold on as though a devastating earthquake were rattling buildings and structures. Despite the number of registrants, organizers have no way of knowing exactly how many people dived under furniture at 10 a.m. and waited for the imaginary seismic activity to cease. ""We wanted it to be so big that you really can't manage it,"" Mark Benthien, executive director of the Earthquake Country Alliance, said of the drill. The alliance -- composed of earthquake professionals, emergency personnel and business and government leaders -- organized the drill.  Watch Californians participate in the drill » . Benthien explained that the registration list is the only basis of estimating how many people participated. ""We're not getting reports in"" other than anecdotal stories, he said. The organizers are encouraging participants who had not registered to do so now, so the number would be more accurate, he added. He said medical and emergency personnel were involved in simulated exercises, including responses to staged collapsed buildings and to medical emergencies. Their drills will continue for several days, he said. Some radio and television stations were to guide participants with drill broadcasts. Thursday's drill was based on a scenario of a magnitude-7.8 earthquake occurring along the southern San Andreas Fault, beginning at the Salton Sea and spreading north nearly 200 miles.

Such an event could kill 1,800 people, injure 50,000 and cause $200 billion in damage, according to the U.S. Geological Survey, which led a team of more than 300 experts in devising the scenario. ""It's not a matter of if an earthquake of this size will happen, but when,"" the Great Southern California ShakeOut's Web site says. In July, a magnitude-5.4 earthquake -- not nearly as strong as the ""big one"" researchers eventually expect -- hit the Los Angeles area. iReport.com: Watch drill participants taking shelter under desks . After that earthquake, researchers said, the stress relieved by smaller tremors was minuscule compared with the amount building up for the ""big one."" Officials hope the earthquake drill will prepare residents for the big quake, whenever it may hit.  View photos of the quake drill » . ""From a geologist's point of view, the answer has to be soon,"" Kate Hutton, a seismologist at the California Institute of Technology, said in July, referring to a large temblor. Another moderate quake, a magnitude 5.4, struck in April in the northern part of California. A magnitude-4.4 quake struck the greater Los Angeles area in August 2007. There is a 99 percent chance of California experiencing a quake of magnitude 6.7 or larger within the next 30 years, according to the Uniform California Earthquake Rupture Forecast, sponsored by the U.S. Geological Survey, the California Geological Survey and the Southern California Earthquake Center and published in Science Daily in April. Benthien said other large earthquake drills have been held in Mexico and South Korea, but ""in terms of the breadth of the participants ... we think this is the largest of that kind."" In Japan, one of the most earthquake-prone countries, residents hold a yearly earthquake drill on the anniversary of the 1923 Great Kanto earthquake, which killed more than 100,000 people. Several companies are sponsoring Great Southern California ShakeOut, including Time Warner Cable Inc., a division of Time Warner Inc., which is the parent company of CNN.","Drill scenario based on 7.8-magnitude quake along the southern San Andreas Fault .
