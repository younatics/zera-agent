"They've toured museums, hosted a trade conference and even watched a high tech toilet maker present his newest design, but King Willem-Alexander and Queen Maxima are now on their way home to the Netherlands. Before they boarded the plane, however, the couple attended a farewell supper with their hosts: Japan's Emperor Akhito and Empress Michiko. Ever the style queen, Maxima pulled out all the stops for her final night on Japanese soil, turning out to meet the Japanese couple in a striking silver grey dress and a sparkling diamond brooch.

Glamorous: Maxima was chic in a silver-grey ensemble as she said goodbye to the Japanese couple . Trade: The three-day tour was intended to boost trade relations between Japan and the Netherlands . Success: The Dutch and Japanese royal couples appeared to enjoy each other's company . The Dutch royal has won plaudits for her glamorous approach to all things fashion, and turned the Japanese visit into a sartorial tour-de-force courtesy of a wardrobe of well-chosen ensembles. Striking though Maxima's wardrobe is, the Dutch couple's visit was almost eclipsed by the unexpected appearance of Crown Princess Masako, who made her first public appearance for 11 years during a state dinner held in their honour. Masako, who was accompanied by her husband Crown Prince Naruhito for the event, had last appeared in public at a state dinner for the president of Mexico in 2003. Since then, the 50-year-old has lived largely as a recluse, after succumbing to a stress-related illness after giving birth to her daughter, Aiko, now 12. Surprise: Crown Princess Masako (left) made her first public appearance in 11 years during the tour . Stylish: Maxima has garnered plaudits for her glamorous - and slightly daring - sense of style . Final meeting: The Dutch royal couple have now boarded a plane bound for the Netherlands . Lovely: Queen Maxima was stylish in green for yesterday's investment development meeting . Japan boasts the oldest continual hereditary monarchy in the world, beginning with Emperor Jimmu who reigned from 660 BC. Since then, 125 emperors have come and gone, with the most recent, Hirohito, famous for being head of state during the Second World War. Unlike other members of the Japanese administration, he was not charged with war crimes and instead oversaw Japan's rebirth as a constitutional monarchy - a process continued by his son, Akhito. Maxima, who is the mother of three young children, has had no such problems and certainly appeared to enjoy the visit to Japan, which began on Wednesday. The three-day visit, which was designed to boost trade between Japan and the Netherlands, saw the royal couple take in a design museum, before taking part in an investment development meeting alongside Dutch officials. Unlike their Japanese counterparts, who have sat on the Chrysanthemum Throne since 1990 following the death of Emperor Hirohito, the Dutch royals are among the newest - and youngest - monarchs in the world. Willem-Alexander, 47, was one of the beneficiaries of a spate of abdications in 2013 which saw his mother Queen Beatrix step down along with King Albert II of Belgium and Pope Benedict XVI. Only Philippe and Mathilde of Belgium and Felipe and Letizia of Spain have been on the throne for a shorter period of time, with the latter two crowned in June following the abdication of Juan-Carlos. But while Letizia and Felipe's reign has so far gone smoothly, Maxima and her husband have had a rougher ride in recent months thanks in part to the MH17 tragedy, which left the Netherlands reeling. Nevertheless, since the crash, the popularity of the Argentina-born Dutch Queen has soared thanks to her tireless work on behalf of the MH17 families. She has also attended some of the repatriation ceremonies and was seen sobbing from her perch beside Prime Minister Mark Rutte as the first flight arrived back on Dutch soil. Interesting stuff: The couple also visited Tokyo University, where they were met by President Junichi Hamada . Big news: At the University, the Dutch royal couple took part in the 'Aging in Place' meeting . Fascinating stuff: The couple listened to a presentation from a high tech toilet maker during the visit . Engaging: Maxima sat next to Emperor Akhito during the welcome dinner at the Imperial Palace . Sumptuous: The Dutch royals were greeted by their Japanese counterparts ahead of the state dinner . Glittering: Maxima opted for an opulent gold gown which she wore with her royal sash and tiara . Warm: The two couples exchanged kisses as they were introduced to one another on day one . Stylish: Maxima pulled out all the stops for her meeting with Empress Michiko and opted for patriotic orange . More recently, the Dutch royals have found themselves cheered to the rafters during public appearances, most notably when they appeared on the balcony of the Noordeinde Palace in the Hague on Prinsjesdag [Prince's Day], along with the former Queen Beatrix, 76 . Maxima, 43, has also become a familiar sight at charity events around the Netherlands, with her most recent outing being at a symposium organised by women's rights activists in Amsterdam, which celebrated the 40th birthday of a Dutch law banning domestic violence. With her husband, she also enjoyed a successful trip to New York last month, where she was seen chatting with fellow queen Letizia during a meeting of the UN General Assembly. The pair were reiunited for the second time in a month two weeks ago, when the Spanish royals paid their Dutch counterparts a friendly visit in The Hague.

"The former wife of the disgraced . financier Danny Porush has spoken about how she watched him transform . from a wholesome husband into a bragging criminal. Mother-of-three . Nancy Porush has revealed how life dramatically changed after her . crooked ex took up a life of fast money, which led to him being . prosecuted and jailed for 39 months. Miss . Porush said: 'As a broker, Danny was raking in huge amounts of cash and . spending it like crazy. Wolf of Wall Street: Jordan Belfort (right) has served his time and now seems to have resumed living the good life. Here, he's pictured with former colleague Danny Porush (left) in their 1990s glory days . 'I saw him morph from a nice wholesome guy into . showy narcissist whom I hardly recognized anymore', the NY Post said. 'Danny . changed with money; he’d frequently stay out late at night, saying he . had a business meeting in the city that he couldn’t get out of. I was a . young mom with two babies. 'I’m not stupid or naive — but I really didn’t know what was going on. I was home watching “Sesame Street” with our sons. Miss . Porush claims her ex even had her sign confusing documents. What she . failed to realise was that he was putting assets in her name as part of . the fraud he was committing. Pictured: Josh Shapiro once profited handsomely from the fraud portrayed in The Wolf of Wall Street, but now says he's trying to repay a public he's wronged . She . said: 'There were many victims Danny defrauded — but I was one of them. And the government validated that. Legally, I too was a victim. I . sold off everything to support my family — teaching yoga and pilates, . selling clothes, skin care, anything to provide for the kids.' Her outspoken . comments came after a man once employed by the real Wolf of Wall Street . revealed just what working at the dodgy Long Island firm Stratton . Oakmont described in the film was like. Josh Shapiro, 41, found himself . caught up in the 1990s in a life of Quaaludes, prostitutes, and fooling . investors under the guidance of infamous brokers Jordan Belfort and . Danny Porush. Now . Shaprio has revealed to the New York Post that working for the men . fictionalized by Leonardo DiCaprio and Jonah Hill was a nightmare and . that the snake oil salesmen have gotten off way too easy for their shady . ways. ‘These people were some of the worst people that I have ever met in my life,’ Shapiro told the Post. Shapiro . arrived home to Long Island from the Marines in 1993 and soon got a job . at Stratton Oakmont after his physician father suggested he enter the . business co-owned by his partner’s son, Danny Porush. Let the good times roll: Josh Shapiro worked for the real Wolf of Wall Street Jordan Belfort, portrayed by Leonardo DiCaprio in the film (pictured), and says the drugs, hookers, and cash were plentiful . 'I was blown away by the intensity': Shapiro was taken in by the lavish lifestyle and was soon making tens of thousands of dollars per month. Pictured is a still from the film . ‘I was a little hesitant at first. I had no interest in stock brokerage. I didn’t know anything about it,’ he told the Post. Porush is fictionalized in the film as Donny Azoff, played by Jonah Hill. When Danny Porush told him he could make $100,000 per month, Shapiro leaped onboard. ‘I was blown away by the intensity,’ he said. ‘You could feel the pulse when you walked into the place.’ Soon, he realized that pulse was fueled with rampant drug use, among other vices. ‘He would come out at other times, completely stewed out of his mind on Quaaludes. Stand on the desk, then fall onto the floor. ‘Or . he would come out angry, pick up a computer — and these are the old CRT . monitors — and smash it on the floor as hard as he possibly could. And . be like, “You’re all a bunch of f- -king losers unless you push this . f- -king stock!” Fictionalized: Shapiro worked for Jordan Belfort beginning in 1993. Belfort is played by Leonardo DiCaprio (right) in the film. Jonah Hill, left, plays Danny Azzuro--reportedly a stand-in for the real-life Danny Porush . From . lowly cold-calling pitch man, Shapiro worked his way to broker. He would . spend his days speaking with investors from states away, urging them to . buy whatever worthless stocks Stratton Oakmont was peddling. ‘You got the account, and then you . started selling them on our IPOs — very enticing initially, but if you . bought, you lost. There was no way to win,’ Shapiro said. But . even with this knowledge in mind, Shapiro said he was kept in the game . with a steady supply of $500-an-hour hookers, Mexican Quaaludes, and . sports cars courtesy of Belfort and Porush. It was great, Shapiro said, until his conscious caught up to his freewheeling ways. ‘I . got to the point where I realized there was no way you could win. To . this day, I still remember two clients’ names who lost all their money . because of me. I think they’re dead now, but I did think about making . amends. Now it’s too late,’ he said. Shapiro left the firm, which was soon . shut down by the FBI. Belfort and Porush were prosecuted. But Shapiro . isn’t convinced they’ve truly done their time. 'Revered like nothing else': Shapiro says Belfort (pictured) was behind the scenes, but a god, and that 'it was all his idea' Money to burn: Shapiro says the brokers would rip up $100 bills as a motivator for fledgling pitch men. Pictured is a still of DiCaprio from the film . ‘Madoff . got years in prison, and these guys have gotten off easy — 22 months . for Belfort, 39 months for Porush — for ripping off $200 million,’ he . said. Now, Shapiro is . out of the finance game completely and works as a physician assistant. He says he’s trying to help people instead of harming them. ‘When . I am giving back, I get a good feeling,’ he said. ‘I feel like I am . absolving myself.

"Nick Yarris, who faced the electric chair after being framed in 1982 for the rape and murder of a woman, is now engaged to British barmaid Jessica Stubley . A former inmate who spent more than 20 years on death row in the US has told of his plans for a new life as husband of a 23-year-old British barmaid. Cleared Nick Yarris, 51, faced the electric chair after being framed in 1982 for the rape and murder of a woman in his native Pennsylvania. He spent 8,057 days behind bars - much of it in solitary confinement - before DNA evidence finally cleared him and he was released in 2004. Mr Yarris then wrote a book about his life on death row called Seven Days To Live which barmaid Jessica Stubley was given to read one day by her boss. Miss Stubley, from Moulton, Lincolnshire, was captivated by his story and sent him a message of support via Facebook. She was surprised when Mr Yarris replied personally and told her he had moved to Britain where he was now divorced and living alone with his dogs. The pair struck up an unlikely love - even though he had been on death row for eight years before she was even born. They moved in together eight weeks after first meeting and three years on are now planning to marry. Philadelphia-born Mr Yarris said: 'When I was first set free I didn't know where home was going to be, but now I know it's where people love you and I've found that here. I couldn't believe someone so lovely could risk having her own life blown apart to be in love with me. 'Her parents were worried and we had to go through a lot to be accepted but the support from her family since has been overwhelming. It is three years now and in that time I have done nothing but try hard to show that I don't deserve what happened to me. 'I inherited a hard work ethic from my dad and I now work six days a week doing deliveries. We have a humble home and money is tight, but I am happy in Lincolnshire. 'I feel safe here. It is not like America, there are no guns on the streets.' Mr Yarris, now a delivery driver for B&Q, added: 'I never put it out there what I have been through. Scroll down for video . Miss Stubley became captivated by Mr Yarris's story after he wrote a book about his life on death row called Seven Days To Live . The pair (pictured left in 2010) moved in together eight weeks after first meeting and three years on are now planning to marry . 'But when something that big has happened you can't hide from it, but neither can you be defined by. It is part of who I am, but look at what I developed from it. 'I found a sense of peace in hell - in the person I was - while they were trying to murder me, and calling me rapist and murderer.' In 1981 Mr Yarris, then a 19-year-old drug addict and alcoholic, was arrested in a stolen car when he jumped a red light. In the scuffle with police the officer's gun went off and he was charged with attempted murder. The couple (pictured in Paris in May 2010) struck up an unlikely love - despite the fact he had been on death row for eight years before she was born . While in custody he read a newspaper report about the rape and murder of a young mum and decided to make up information about it in a bid to bargain his way out of jail. He accused a man, who he believed to be dead, of beating, stabbing and raping 32-year-old Linda Craig in a churchyard on the borders of Pennsylvania. But his plan backfired when he found himself accused of the crime and then tried and convicted on flimsy evidence and sentenced to death in 1982. Mr Yarris (pictured with Miss Stubley in Key West, Straits of Florida, in Sept 2011) said: 'I couldn't believe someone so lovely could risk having her own life blown apart to be in love with me' Mr Yarris spent the next 23 years fighting his conviction and suffered brutal beatings at the hands of cellmates. He even contemplated suicide but then decided to turn his mind to education. He devoured books and took distance learning courses in an attempt to 'make my mind beautiful'. He was only freed when he became so ill with hepatitis C in prison that he begged for the state to kill him. A judge ordered DNA evidence to be re-tested and he was subsequently cleared - 8,057 days after he was thrown onto death row. Mr Yarris (pictured with Miss Stubley) was convicted on flimsy evidence after he decided to make up information on the rape and murder in a bid to bargain his way out of jail, after he had initially been charged with attempted murder in a separate incident . And although he still suffers from physical pain Mr Yarris has said that the survivor's guilt is harder to bear. He said: 'For more than 20 years my identity was bonded with those people on death row, I cared about them. I believe life imprisonment is far worse than the death penalty. 'But as long as I have love I have hope, and Jesse has proved that.'

"This is a county season full of opportunity, with domestic performances counting towards England selection more than at any time in years, but certainly Eoin Morgan has more to play for than most. Morgan is the man England are desperate to include in all forms of the game, so much so that they dangled a particularly juicy carrot in front of him by suggesting that a Test comeback could be his if he withdrew from the Indian Premier League. The early weeks of the season have seen others provide a more convincing case than Morgan for what would seem to be one Test middle-order vacancy at No 5 — notably Gary Ballance. But the Irishman is very much in contention to face Sri Lanka next month even if he does not score a shedload of runs. Knocking on the door: Morgan has remained an integral part of England's one-day set-up . In good nick: Yorkshire's Gary Ballance is the incumbent No 5 test batsman for England . It is not just Morgan’s ability to provide the flair England will be missing post Kevin Pietersen, it is also his temperament and leadership ability that make him so important. One of the reasons Alastair Cook has not come under more pressure as captain is the dearth of alternatives. Stuart Broad has one of the best cricket brains in the side but, as he intimated this week, he may have to give up the Twenty20 captaincy as he prioritises Test and one-day cricket. As a fast bowler grappling with modern schedules, he could not contemplate any extra responsibility. With Ian Bell never really dispelling the feeling that he is more follower than leader and Joe Root not ready, that leaves Morgan as the only viable alternative to Cook. No pressure: Cook has something of a leadership vacuum beneath him . Morgan’s 16-match Test career has hardly been a disaster, as two centuries would testify, and he has eradicated the glitch that saw him crouching excessively at the crease during his last, ill-fated series against Pakistan. He has always argued that Test cricket is his priority but it has not looked that way when he has seemed happier to sit on the benches of IPL clubs than try to prove himself in first-class cricket. Now that has changed. ‘The last two years opportunities haven’t been there,’ argued Morgan, 27. ‘One-day cricket has been my strength. I was a late starter in red-ball cricket. I am still learning and trying to improve, but I don’t think a lesser stint in the IPL or an extra couple of Aprils in England would have helped me get back in the Test side before now. Found out: Morgan's last Test outing came against Pakistan in February 2012 . ‘Now, I think, everybody sees a big chance. Having played a bit in the past and enjoyed my time in the Test team, I would like to be back on board.’ Morgan, who will captain Middlesex’s one-day side this year, travels to Aberdeen for Friday’s first international of the season knowing that by the end of the summer he could have cemented himself in Test cricket again. And given England another leadership option. BUMBLE'S WORLD - What caught David Lloyd's eye this week: . The Good . The new broom has swept clean and here we go post-KP. It’s great to see so many young players coming to the fore in English cricket — Sam Robson is all the rage and has a chance of playing Test cricket soon, while plenty more are putting themselves in the shop window. Knocking on the door: Australia-born Sam Robson is expected to open with Cook . I’ve been up at Durham this week where, among eye-catching performances from Adam Lyth and Jonny Bairstow, I’ve been very impressed by another likely lad in Durham opener Mark Stoneman. Opportunity knocks! The Bad . So good has this game between Durham and Yorkshire been that I can’t understand why Joe Root and Gary Ballance have been kicking their heels at a Loughborough training camp rather than getting miles in their legs here. It’s nonsense. England’s argument is that their players have needed white-ball practice before playing Scotland on Friday but white, red, pink or green it’s still a ball. They should have been playing in a game at this stage of the season. Cotton wool: England's Joe Root was withdrawn from county action this week . NEWMAN’S FINAL WORD . Interesting though it will be to visit the Aberdeen ground where Sir Don Bradman scored his last century on British soil when England play Scotland on Friday, it does seem extraordinary that Mannofield will host the first international of the domestic season. Cricket schedules are increasingly barmy but Aberdeen on May 9?

"Hearts cleared the final hurdle to exiting administration and immediately set about fighting their way back to Scottish football’s top level. Foundation of Hearts chief Ian Murray hailed supporters for rallying round to keep their club from dying - but warned that plenty of hard graft will be required to bring long-term stability to Tynecastle. The completion of millionaire businesswoman Ann Budge’s £2.5million takeover means the Foundation  - funded by monthly pledges from punters - are now legally committed to raising £1.4m a year towards operating costs. Done deal: Ann Budge has completed her takeover of Hearts, the Foundation of Hearts has confirmed . Finally something to smile about: Relegated Hearts have new owners and have been taken out of administration . They plan to eventually take ownership . of the club, but have to repay within five years the ‘capital loan’ Budge has issued to fund a CVA at a club left close to extinction by . former owner Vladimir Romanov. ‘It’s a great relief for supporters,’ Murray told Sportsmail. ‘They are the ones who have constantly put their . hands in their pockets, supported the club and the Foundation. ‘Every . single Hearts supporter who has done that should congratulate . themselves. But the hard work starts now for the Foundation because, . essentially, we have financial commitments to be able to keep the club . afloat with working capital – and we have to pay Ann back as well. ‘So the key task for the club is to get into a stable financial position and prepare for the Championship next season.’ Starting . with a completely clean balance sheet, and with the Foundation . providing funds on top of ticket sales and commercial revenues, it is . anticipated Hearts will be in a strong position to challenge Rangers for . the Championship title. But Murray said: ‘Let’s take on those challenges tomorrow. Today we’re over the line and we’re delighted.’ Battler: Gary Locke's Hearts side has endured a tough season on the pitch . Manager Gary Locke, out of contract in a matter of weeks, has yet to be given any assurances about his future. Admitting . that any decision will be entirely down to Budge and her advisers, . Murray insisted: ‘That’s an unfair question to ask today. Ann will come . into the club on Monday and start doing the job she needs to do. ‘I’m sure she’ll be having discussions with various people, meeting all the staff and players. That is day one of her new job. ‘Right now we’re just celebrating that everything is done and dusted – and the Lithuanians are no longer involved in Hearts.’ Budge . also warned of the workload ahead in a statement released on Friday night, . declaring: ‘I am truly delighted to be able to confirm that I am now the . proud majority shareholder in Hearts Football Club. It has been a long . hard struggle to get to this point but together we have achieved our . goal. ‘The next few months - even years - won’t be easy as we work . hard to rebuild our club. However, let’s not think about that today - . let’s just enjoy! I have absolutely no doubt that together we will . succeed. ‘As the days and weeks unfold we will, of course, share our . plans for the future. However, as you will all know, we are now into the . process of making a formal offer for the remaining shares in the club . and while that process is in train, there are some restrictions on how . much we can say publicly. So...no press conferences yet, I’m afraid. ‘However, in the meantime, enjoy the moment. This is a great day in the history of our club.’","Ann Budge completes a £2.5m takeover of Hearts .

"Two brothers have been reunited through Facebook after losing touch and spending quarter of a century living on opposite sides of the world. David Horner, 53, and his younger brother Stuart, 49, lost contact with each other after their father's funeral in 1989, following which Stuart travelled with the RAF before settling in New Zealand. David, from Sheffield, south Yorkshire, moved house, and despite both of them trying to contact the other, they failed to do so until earlier this year, when they finally met after finding each other through Facebook. David Horner, 53, left, and his brother Stuart, 49, were reunited after losing touch for quarter of a century . The boys lost touch after their father's funeral in 1989, when Stuart Horner joined the RAF and went abroad . David, a retired chef, said: 'He looks totally different.  I don't know if I'd recognise him passing in the street.' His younger brother, who lives in New Zealand and no longer works for the RAF, explained how they lost touch. 'Our dad was our point of contact, so after he died we lost that,' Stuart said.  'I struggled to grieve after losing my dad, and threw myself into work. 'I travelled around a lot, so I was not easy to track down, and David had also moved.' While Stuart sought to lose himself as he struggled with his grief, his older brother never forgot him, and each year bought a birthday card for Stuart that he wrote but could not post. He said: 'All these years I never forgot his birthday.  I bought him a card every year and used to write him emotional messages. 'It helped when I was ill and had two strokes - it gave me someone to turn to.' Every year, David Horner bought his 'baby brother' a birthday card, which he wrote and stored away for him . When the brothers eventually spoke over the phone, David said: 'There weren't many words - we just sobbed' 'Found out I have cancer again': David's 2005 card tells of his health battles, adding: 'Wish you were here xx' But despite his faith that one day he would see his younger brother again, he had moments of doubt. 'In 2012 I began to lose faith and wrote in his birthday card ""I doubt we'll see each other again"",' he said. But the following year after doing some research on the internet he found his niece, Stuart's daughter Tiffany, now 21, on Facebook. David said: 'I contacted her to see if he was her father and incredibly she said Yes.  I couldn't believe it. But the happy ending was postponed when either Tiffany or Stuart wrote down David's email address wrong. 'Unbeknownst to me, Stuart wrote me this long emotional email but it didn't get to me,' David said. 'That year I wrote in his card ""I guess this is goodbye - I tried to get in touch but I haven't heard anything, so I suppose you're not interested.""' Eventually, however, he made contact with Tiffany again, giving her his telephone number, and this time she put the two brothers in touch. Last year's card tells of David's despair as he signs of saying 'Thought I had found you but maybe not xx' So close: David said he wished his brother had been around to talk to as he battled with health problems . This year's card bears the message 'Wish I could have time with you' - and David's wish was finally granted . 'Stuart called me - I honestly couldn't believe it,' David said.  'When he rang there weren't many words exchanged - we just cried. 'I thought I was dreaming and when someone pinched me I'd wake up.' After they spoke, Stuart and his partner Lara Franklin, 41, flew 11,000 miles from their home in Wellington to Britain to visit David, who hadn't been well at his home in Sheffield. David, who suffered two strokes and was hospitalised four years ago for a lung condition, said he felt lucky he survived his illnesses to see his brother and sobbed as his sibling's car pulled up outside his house. He said: 'I was scared we wouldn't ever see each other again, but I never gave up hope. We're definitely not losing touch again.' Finally, he presented his younger brother with the 25 birthday cards he hadn't been able to send him. 'Sitting down to read the birthday cards together made us both very emotional,' David said. 'I never really got over my dad's death and I clung to the hope I would see Stuart again - which is shown in the messages I wrote to him. 'Some years I would write about what I'd been through, and others I would just sign off 'Love, your brother'. 'Stuart has quite a stiff upper lip through years of working with the RAF, but he got very upset reading them.'","David Horner, 53, and his brother Stuart, 49, last saw each other in 1989 .

"Four Utah National Guard soldiers are being disciplined for their unauthorized involvement and use of military vehicles in a risque video featuring bikini-clad women firing high-powered weapons and riding in tanks. Guard Lt. Col. Steven Fairbourn said Saturday that a 19th Special Forces non-commissioned officer who inappropriately allowed the video to be partially shot at Camp Williams in May has been relieved of his leadership position and faces a reprimand and mandatory early retirement. The three other soldiers will receive lesser measures ranging from counseling to a reprimand, he said. The $200 cost for military fuel used during the shoot also will be recouped from the soldiers involved. Scroll down for video . Risque: The models were at Camp Williams for a Hot Shots pinup calendar and behind-the-scenes video shoot . Pinups: The calendar features women wearing camouflage bikinis and other tight clothing while shooting guns and riding in military vehicles . In trouble: Four Utah National Guard soldiers are being disciplined for their unauthorized involvement and use of military vehicles in the making of the video . Fairbourn earlier said the three members took part in the video after getting permission from a senior official who shouldn't have given them the green light. 'We just have to learn from our mistakes and go forward, and that's how we're trying to approach this,' Fairbourn said. 'Corrective measures are in place to ensure this doesn't happen again.' An internal investigation, completed Friday, found unauthorized Guard support was limited to five vehicles and one boat used as props for the shoot. The investigation confirmed the Guard did not provide the weapons or ammunition used for it. The names of the four soldiers were not released. Up for grabs: The Hot Shots calendar, partially shot at Camp Williams, is available for $14 and is expected to be delivered sometime this month . Mystery: The names of the four Utah National Guard soldiers who helped out the 'Hot Shots' production have not been released . 'This was certainly a mistake, but one action among multiple years of service for these individuals,' Fairbourn said. 'We are dealing with Iraq and Afghanistan veterans who have served their country in time of war.' The Utah Guard, in a statement issued Saturday, said it regretted its involvement in the shoot and would not tolerate the unauthorized use of federal and state funds. 'However, this error in judgment of these few soldiers does not diminish the commitment and resolve of the Utah Guard and its more than 7,000 members to serve the citizens of Utah and our nation,' the statement read. The video, produced by an England-based company, is a promotional 'behind the scenes' look at the making of an annual pinup calendar. It features women wearing camouflage bikinis and other tight clothing while shooting guns and riding in military vehicles. Two members of a Utah state SWAT team who appeared in the video in uniform also face discipline, Department of Public Safety officials have said.

"An aluminum scrap first found twenty-three years ago is now believed to have likely been part of Amelia Earhart's plane. The International Group for Historic Aircraft Recovery (TIGHAR) thinks the Artifact 2-2-V-1 scrap, found on Nikumaroro, or Gardner Island, was used as a fill-in for a navigational window when Earhart stopped in Miami, Discovery News reported. Scroll down for video . Scrap: This piece of aluminum was found on Gardner Island in 1991 and may be a piece of Amelia Earhart's Lockheed Electra plane . Evidence: A photograph from The Miami Herald taken before Earhart went missing showed  where the aluminum piece had been installed . Pilot: Amelia Earhart is seen in her Lockheed Electra in this 1936 file photo . TIGHAR executive director Ric Gillespie told the news outlet 'The Miami Patch was an expedient field repair. Its complex fingerprint of dimensions, proportions, materials and rivet patterns was as unique to Earhart’s Electra as a fingerprint is to an individual.' The news outlet pointed out a photograph from the Miami Herald, which showed where the aluminum piece was set up before Earhart went missing in July 1937. Discovery News reported that TIGHAR members  found at Wichita Air Services that Artifact 2-2-V-1's elements were a fit with the patch, and that it also fit a Lockheed Electra currently undergoing restoration. 'This is the first time an artifact found on Nikumaroro has been shown to have a direct link to Amelia Earhart,' Gillespie also said. The scrap may indicate that Earhart and Fred Noonan, who navigated the plane, died on Nikumaroro, the website reported. Theory: If the piece belonged to Earhart's Lockheed Electra, it indicates that she and navigator Fred Noonan died on Nikumaroro . Search: The International Group for Historic Aircraft Recovery (TIGHAR) is going back to Nikumaroro for further testing next year to find out what happened to Amelia Earhart's plane . 'The many fractures, tears, dents and gouges found on this battered sheet of aluminum may be important clues to the fate and resting place of the Electra,' Gillespie told the news outlet. The landing gear for Earhart's plane may have ended up in the water off Nikumaroro, going off of forensic imaging that was used on an archival 1937 photograph showing something in the water, according to the website. It has also been suggested through sonar imagery that the fuselage is also in the water near the coast - and another TIGHAR trip to Nikumaroro is planned to take place in June of next year to see if more information can be discovered, the website said. Gillespie also said that 'Funding is being sought, in part, from individuals who will make a substantial contribution in return for a place on the expedition team.'","An aluminum scrap  is now believed to have likely been part of Amelia Earhart's plane when she tried to circumnavigate the equator in 1937 .

"Going on holiday alone is not such a big deal these days it seems, with nearly a quarter of people saying they travel abroad by themselves. This is a sharp increase over the previous year, which showed only nine per cent of travellers were prepared to go it alone. The top reasons given for flying solo included 'looking for love' and 'to rediscover' themselves, but one in five solo holiday-makers confessed they simply 'had no one to go with'. Scroll down for video . A jetty of my own: The number of people choosing to go on holiday by themselves has risen, new figures show . Ongoing research into the holiday preferences of Britons also showed that 76 per cent of respondents had never been on holiday by themselves. The new research was carried out by UK online travel agency www.sunshine.co.uk to keep track of booking trends and patterns, and quizzed nearly 2,000 people aged 18 from the UK. Respondents who had been on a holiday abroad alone were asked to disclose all the reasons why they had had travelled by themselves, and the highest number said they were looking for love. 'To re-discover myself' was the next most popular answer, while a confident 24 per cent admitted they preferred their own company - and 19 per cent said they had no one to go with.

"Belfast is braced for its most violent week of rioting since the Good Friday Agreement after 29 police officers were hurt in sectarian clashes at the weekend. More than 1,000 thugs, believed to be supported by loyalist paramilitaries, bombarded police and nationalists with petrol bombs, fireworks and rocks following a demonstration against the decision to limit the number of days the Union Flag is flown from City Hall. Masked hooligans, many draped in Union Flags, also set cars alight and used makeshift battering rams to attack police riot vehicles. Scroll down for video .

'This has nothing to do with real issues around flags and identity in a shared society, which are the subject of intensive political discussions at present.' Ms Villiers urged restraint. 'We can't afford to have these continuing protests damage our economy and destroy potential jobs for Northern Ireland's young people,' she said. Sinn Fein President Gerry Adams said there should be a cross-community response. 'But there can be no going back. The tiny minorities who want to cling to the past must be rejected. Sectarianism must be tackled and ended.' Ulster Unionist Party leader Mike Nesbitt has co-chaired a unionist forum designed to address grievances. 'Street violence from so-called unionists, no matter what age, advances nothing but the cause of Irish nationalism.

"The youngest daughter of the crazed Florida father who shot and killed two of his three children last week only survived because her older sister acted as a human shield. Lauren Mohney, nine, is currently in a stable condition only because her sister, Savanna Mohney, 14, put herself in the way of her father, David Mohney's bullets during his shooting spree at the family home in Port Orange. When officers responded to the home they found the girls mother, Cynthia Mohney, 48, curled up between her two daughters and the estranged couple's son, David dead in his bed. Scroll down for video . Happy family: A look at Cynthia Mohney (far right) with her three children Lauren, Savanna and David, who were all shot by their father David Mohney . Still stable: Savanna, 14, (left) saved her little sister, Lauren (right) from their father and the nine-year-old is currently at a local hospital and in a medically induced coma . Court filings showed David Mohney wanted to leave his wife and move with daughter Savanna (pictured) and her siblings to South Dakota . 'We believe Savanna was coming down the stairs because she suspected something bad had happened (to her brother),' said state attorney Zachary Stoumbos to the Journal Online. 'But then changed her mind and went to her younger sister's bedroom to protect her.' Stoumbus said he belives Savanna's selfless actions saved her younger sister from their crazed father, who locked his wife out of the house after telling her he was going to kill their children because she wanted a divorce. 'Savanna was draped over Lauren,' said Stoumbos. 'We believe that because she protected her little sister, Lauren's injuries were not as bad.' The nine-year-old is currently in a coma at the Arnold Palmer Hospital in Orlando. Her mother has not left her side. According to Cynthia Mohney's lawyer, David Mohney told her on the morning of the murders, 'If you don't come back to me and stop the divorce, I will kill our children.' The retired Army sergeant then reportedly punched her in the mouth at their Port Orange, Florida, home, and added, 'If you’re going to take my kids away, you will not have them and you will go through the rest of your life without children.' Killer and a coward: David (above) killed himself after killing his children . Zachary Stoumbos, the attorney for grieving mother Cynthia, says her husband woke her up early that morning saying that something was wrong with their son, before taking her to the kitchen and showing that he had a gun. 'He continued to tell her, ""You will be back with me,"" and, ""This divorce was going to stop,""' Stoumbos told WFTV. Then, when Cynthia ran to get help, she heard shots fired while at a neighbor's home. She immediately ran back to the house and was found lying between her two daughter when authorities arrived. 'His hate took over his love for his children,' added Stoumbos. 'I can't imagine that level of evil, that level of hate.' David had claimed his wife Cynthia was a violent, abusive alcoholic in court papers filed just two months before he gunned down his children Friday in their quiet, middle-class neighborhood just south of Daytona Beach. The girls: Cynthia, with daughter Savanna and Lauren, has not left the side of her only surviving child, Lauren, since the incident occurred . Smiling girls: The two sisters, Lauren and Savanna and their brother, David, before their father decided to try and kill them . However, neighbors said both parents were troubled. In a 911 call before the shooting, a neighbor told a dispatcher that neither parent should have had children because they were 'a little bit selfish and self-centered' and said 'you can't believe either one of them.' He had recently finished chiropractic school while she supported the family working as a physician's assistant, making $220,000. Nearly a month after he filed for divorce, the husband sought a protective injunction against his wife June 3. He said in court papers his wife had been drinking heavily and slapping him and their children on their chests, backs and arms. Florida's child welfare agency said Cynthia had recently been treated for substance abuse. The slain children were 11-year-old David Mohney and 14-year-old Savanna Mohney, Volusia County Sheriff Ben Johnson said. Nine-year-old Lauren Mohney was also was shot and in stable condition at a hospital. Cynthia  wasn't injured. 'If he wants to commit suicide, let him commit suicide. To shoot the children, that's cowardly,' Johnson said at a news conference outside the family's home. Deputies received a call at 5:11am Friday. Arriving deputies found the two girls in an upstairs bedroom and the boy in a bedroom on the first floor. Their father was in the kitchen with a handgun next to him. Survivor: The wife was at the house of a neighbor trying to get help in their Port Orange, Florida, neighborhood when the shooting occurred while the children were asleep at the home . In court papers, David Mohney said he and his children 'prefer living in a climate with snow to celebrate Christmas and other holidays.' Pictured: victim Savanna Mohney, 14 . Little guy: Young David was pronounced dead on the scene . In his divorce filing, David said his family moved to Florida in 2010 so he could study at Palmer College of Chiropractic's campus in Port Orange. He graduated in September 2013, but failed his first time taking the board exam and hoped to try again soon. He said in the court papers that returning to Rapid City, South Dakota, had been his family's plan all along, but his wife had become opposed to it. He said his children also wanted to make the 1,900-mile move to get relief from their allergies and because they found the Midwest region better suited their 'morals and values.' David Mohney said he and his children also 'prefer living in a climate with snow to celebrate Christmas and other holidays.' When he filed for divorce, David Mohney said little about problems with his wife. He made more specific accusations when he asked a Volusia County court for a protective injunction June 3. In that filing, David Mohney cited four instances between April 4 and May 29 in which he said his wife had slapped one or more of their children. He said his wife would hit the children — sometimes several times — for arguing with each other, talking back to her, or for not picking up their toys and clothes when she told them to. 'The ""hits"" described in the examples are loud and hard, beyond corporal punishment,' David Mohney wrote. 'My children were crying, afraid and trying to duck or get away from Cynthia.' However, he dismissed the request for protection two weeks after filing it. The state's child abuse hotline was notified in June that Cynthia Mohney had a substance abuse problem after an incident at a restaurant. Cynthia Mohney followed through on treatment, according to the Department of Children and Families.","David Mohney shot his three children and then himself on Friday .

"Barry Walsh died after he was bit 42 times by a Staffordshire bull terrier at his home (file picture) A man died after his girlfriend's pit bull bit him 42 times after she stormed out of his house following an argument. Barry Walsh, 43, suffered five broken ribs and a ruptured spleen before he bled to death internally at his bedsit in Westcliff-on-Sea in Essex in January this year, an inquest heard. His girlfriend of seven months, Purdey Clarke, said her Staffordshire bull terrier Gypsy had bit him during a row and she stormed out, returning two days later to find him dead on a mattress. Miss Clarke, 36, told the inquest at Chelmsford Coroners' Court on Friday: 'He slapped me round the face and my dog bit him. She was scared and she attacked him. 'He held her up by her two front legs and was going to go like this (pull them apart) and I had to take Gypsy out of his house to mine, because he would have done it.' She added: 'I left and Gypsy didn't come out with me - it was very unusual for her not to come out with me.' The court was told that Miss Clarke initially told police she had been away from Mr Walsh's flat for only half an hour, but at the inquest she admitted she had been away for two days. Det Supt Lucy Morris said Miss Clarke had never given a 'coherent account' of the incident and the dog was 'running riot' when police arrived. She added that because it had a history of violence, Miss Clarke signed over ownership to the police for it to be put down. Consultant forensic pathologist Benjamin Swift told the court that Mr Walsh had sustained blunt force trauma, which ruptured his spleen and could have been caused by him falling on furniture, but said that could not be certain. Some of the 42 bite wounds had been so ferocious they broke his shin. Corner Caroline Beasley-Murray said there were 'bits of the jigsaw missing' in the evidence and, as Mr Walsh and the dog were the only ones in the room at the time, she had no choice but to record an open verdict. She said: 'We will never, ever, know or ever be entirely clear what happened. 'He was clearly much loved and it's good to see all of his family members here at the inquest. I hope you will be able to look back on the happy memories you have of him . At the time of the attack, neighbours said the dog was 'highly protective and edgy'. It has since been destroyed. One said it was a 'very protective' animal that made him feel uncomfortable. Barry Walsh died in his bedsit in Valkyrie Road, Westcliff-on-Sea in Essex (front, pictured) in January this year . Billy Morgan, 53, who lived in the flat above Mr Walsh, said he had shared a drink with him and his partner at their flat to celebrate his birthday - where he also met the brown Staffordshire bull terrier. He said: 'His partner told me it was very protective of her and they were always telling it ""move"", ""shut up"" and ""sit there"" while I was there having a beer. 'When I got my arm out the dog looked up. If you made a move, it would look at you or growl at you, it made me feel really uncomfortable. 'I don't know whether it attacked him because they were arguing - I have heard them talking loudly before but never shouting or rowing.' He said the death had left him greatly upset, describing Barry as a kind, well-natured man. He said: 'I still can't get over what's happened, it's such depressing news. I didn't sleep for the two nights afterwards because I couldn't stop thinking about it. It's a nutty world and this has really upset me.' One neighbour, who asked not to be named, said: 'Everyone in the house is so shocked that it happened. We can't believe it. I think it will be on a lot of people's minds whether they want to stay here now.' Police said the Staffordshire bull terrier, which is not a banned breed in the UK, had been removed from the property following the attack and had since been destroyed. Corner Caroline Beasley-Murray recorded an open verdict at Chelmsford Coroners' Court on Friday . An Essex Police spokesman said at the time of the incident: 'The death of a man found at a flat in Valkyrie Road, Westcliff, on Tuesday, January 7, is not being treated as suspicious.

"Denials: Physiotherapist Leith Brown, pictured, says Patient A's husband wants to 'ruin' him . A hospital physiotherapist had an affair with a married female patient – and the couple spent nights together while the woman’s husband was sleeping in the same house, a disciplinary hearing has heard. Leith Brown could be struck off the professional register if allegations of misconduct are proved. The affair ended when the husband found out about it and confronted senior managers at the private Hospital of St John and St Elizabeth in North London, which has previously treated Gwyneth Paltrow, Kate Winslet, Jerry Hall and Kate Moss. The woman, known as Patient A, told the hearing that Mr Brown had seduced her when she went to see him for treatment. She said he had been ‘charming and professional’ – until he touched her inappropriately during one session. A similar incident occurred at another consultation, but she told the tribunal she had not complained because her ten-year-old niece was in the room at the time. The affair began in 2012, soon after she attended a course he ran in ‘Mindfulness’. The couple would meet at an annex of her home. Over a period of six months, Brown would stay most nights while the husband was in the main part of the house. Brown also benefited from thousands of pounds that Patient A spent on restaurant trips and taxis, while in exchange she had not paid for some treatment sessions. ‘We were having an affair, we were not having a relationship,’ she told the tribunal. ‘We couldn’t have a relationship. I’m a married woman. ‘He might have wanted a relationship but he was having sex with other women anyway. ‘He wanted us to live together but it wasn’t going to happen. He was delusional.’ Their trysts ended just over a year later when the woman’s daughter discovered emails between her mother and Mr Brown, and told her businessman father. Patient A told the panel that the 59-year-old physiotherapist had been ‘very seductive and persuasive. He bombarded me with texts. ‘I was pursued and seduced. I was under his spell. I deceived my husband. I feel awful about it... It’s what he [Mr Brown] wanted.’ But Mr Brown’s barrister, Sue Sleeman, said the sexual relationship started only after her treatment had ended. Asked why she hadn’t complained earlier about his behaviour, Patient A said: ‘I didn’t tell my husband because I wanted to protect Mr Brown.’ The physiotherapist, who is from New Zealand, told the conduct committee of the Health and Care Professions Council that he often met the woman at her home: . ‘She would cook meals for me, we would watch TV together. We enjoyed the sort of relationship you enjoy with anyone you were in love with. I was not particularly interested in some sort of brief sexual affair. I fell in love.’ He said the allegations of inappropriate touching were ‘monstrous’ and that Patient A and her husband, who wanted to ‘ruin’ him, had invented them . Natasha Price, who organises physiotherapy services at the hospital in St John’s Wood, told the tribunal: ‘This relationship was not forced upon this lady. It was a consensual relationship. He should not have been treating her at the time he was in a relationship with her.’ Mr Brown, who no longer practises at the hospital, denies all the allegations against him. The panel will announce its decision in December.

"They are the fashionable way to keep disease at bay. But expensive fish oil supplements may be doing little for our hearts while putting sharks in peril. Conservationists have warned that our appetite for omega-3 supplements and capsules has led to rampant fishing of deep-sea sharks, whose huge livers are oozing with valuable oils. Deep sea sharks, including the goblin shark (pictured), are being killed for the oils found within their livers . With some species taking decades to mature, the deep-sea dwellers are extremely vulnerable to over-exploitation. The charity Oceana Europe claims that 'pirate' fisherman are taking full advantage of laws that allow shark oil extracted from species caught outside the EU to be sold here. The liver oils, including omega-3, is 'the new gold,' said the charity. Marine wildlife scientist Allison Perry said: 'The omega-3 tablets that we buy comes from lots of different sources but there are some that are shark liver oil. Salmon (pictured right) and mackerel (left) are also high in Omega-3 . 'There are some vessels actively targeting deep-water sharks.' The . fats, which are particularly abundant in oily fish such as salmon and . mackerel, are credited with boosting the health of the heart, body and . brain, with studies linking them to staving off ills from heart attacks . to dementia and depression. But several recent studies, including two large-scale round-ups, have questioned whether they help heart health. In demand: Omega-3 supplements and capsules (such as the one pictured) come from many sources but some are shark liver oil . The most recent, published in the Journal of the American Medical Association, crunched together the results of 20 studies involving almost 70,000 people. The review’s Greek authors said that omega-3 fats may help the heart by lowering levels of harmful blood fats, stopping harmful changes in heart rhythm, keeping the blood thin or lowering blood pressure. However, with studies coming to different conclusion, there was a need to clear up confusion. Their analysis found that those who took omega-3 were no less likely to die of a heart attack or stroke than others. The University Hospital of Ioannina researchers, however, did not completely dismiss the idea of supplementation. They said that while their results do not back wide-scale use of omega-3, more research is needed on the impact on different types of heart problems. Dosage should also be investigated further. A second-round up, by South Korean researchers in May, reached a similar conclusion. And two years ago, the New England Journal of Medicine reported that heart attack patients who took omega-3 were no less likely to go on to have a second heart attack than those who did not supplement their diet. Craze: Demand for omega-3 fish oils is putting sharks in peril . Others say that fish’s health benefits may lie elsewhere. Professor Tom Sanders, of King’s College London, told the Sunday Times: ‘There is a beneficial effect from fish and it be fish oil or it may be something else. ‘Heart disease rates have fallen a lot in the past 50 years anyway. ‘The biggest problem is people thinking that if they do take a supplement, they can do everything else wrong in terms of diet and lifestyle.’ But some experts believe the benefits to the brain are undisputable. Dr Alex Richardson, an Oxford University academic who has spent years researching the effect of omega-3 on behaviour, learning and mood, said: ‘It is an irrefutable fact that the brain tissue needs fatty acids.’","'Pirate' fishermen take advantage of laws allowing shark oil extracted from species caught outside the EU to be sold here .

'Mercedes don't have any competition. They are so far in front of the field,' said Button. 'In Monaco (in a fortnight) you might see Red Bull be strong and give them a run for their money, but apart from that it's going to be very tricky for anyone to challenge them over the next six or seven races.

"Raid: Police have searched the home of Reverend Paul Flowers after he was filmed apparently buying hard drugs . The sordid past of disgraced Co-op bank boss Reverend Paul Flowers was laid bare today after it emerged he has a conviction for gross indecency and quit as a councillor for having pornography on his computer. The fallen Methodist minister is already . being investigated by the police after apparently buying hard drugs, . including crack cocaine and crystal meth. But it has now been revealed that in the past 30 years he has been involved in a series of sex scandals. In 1981 he was convicted of gross indecency after he was caught by police performing a sex act with a trucker in a public toilet - but he was forgiven by the church. Rev Flowers, who is gay, admitted the offence at Fareham Magistrates' Court in Hampshire and was fined £75 with £35 legal costs, yet his church let him continue in his job because he was sorry. He also resigned as a Labour councillor in Bradford in 2011 after 'inappropriate but not illegal adult content' was found on a computer he used, the city council said today. A rent boy claimed today that the Methodist also used his Co-op email account to organise drug-fuelled sex sessions with and others while he was still chairman of the bank. After his gross indecency conviction, Flowers told magistrates he was 'shamed and embarrassed' about the incident, but maintained he was involved 'at the other man's . instigation'. Yet he was allowed to continue as a Methodist minister. 'This was a matter for our usual procedures and after that process was complete it was decided he could continue as a minister,' a Methodist Ministry spokesman said. 'This matter did not preclude him from his activities in the church. He was very contrite, and he continued his work', . Caught on camera: The Rev Paul Flowers was filmed counting money for drugs in a scandal that has rocked the Co-op and the Methodist Church . Flowers served as a member of Bradford . Council’s executive from May 2010 to August 2011, when he stepped down . from the post, saying he had “increasing and competing demands” on his . time. The following month he resigned as a Labour councillor for the Great Horton ward, having served on the council since 2001. At . the time, he said in a statement: 'It has become clear to me that, over . the longer term, I will be unable to sustain the workload associated . with performing both roles to the best of my ability.' But . the council said today: 'Inappropriate but not illegal adult content . was found on a Council computer handed in by Councillor Flowers for . servicing. - Methodist Ministry spokesman on Rev Flowers' gross indecency conviction . 'This was put to him and he resigned immediately.' It comes days after the Mail on Sunday . revealed Rev Flowers bought hard drugs just after he was grilled by MPs . on the Treasury Select Committee over the bank's disastrous . performance. In the . shocking video the 63-year-old was seen in his car discussing the . cocaine and crystal meth he wants from a dealer in Leeds. He then counts out £300 in £20 notes and sends a friend to make the deal. The Co-operative Group said today its . chairman Len Wardle had resigned with immediate effect, days after the . former chairman became embroiled in the drugs scandal. In the spotlight: Reverend Paul Flowers in December 1990 when he was vice-chairman of Rochdale Council¿s social services committee during the ¿satanic abuse¿ fiasco . Flowers was the £132,000-a-year . chairman of the 'ethical' Co-op Bank from 2010 until May this year when . he stepped down as the bank's financial woes became apparent. The bank . lost £700 million in the first six months of this year. Guest: A friend of disgraced Reverend Paul Flowers said he is house sitting for him, but the former Co-op chairman is in hiding . On . the day after his appearance at the Commons, Flowers sent a text . reading: 'I was ""grilled"" by the Treasury Select Committee yesterday and . afterwards came to Manchester to get wasted with friends. The video and a series of damning text messages leaked by acquaintance Stuart Davies, who was 'disgusted by his hypocrisy'. The text messages prove Rev Flowers . was using hard drugs in the days surrounding his crucial testimony to . the Treasury Committee on November 6. A parishioner who worships at Flowers' Bradford church last night told The Sun: 'The revelations are repulsive. People idolised him.' Twenty . or so years ago, Flowers came to public attention as vice-chairman of . Rochdale Council’s social services committee during the ‘satanic abuse’ fiasco between 1988 and 1991. It involved social workers making lurid claims about satanic rituals being performed on children and, as a result, 20 children from six families were placed in care. However, the police found no evidence and a government-backed inquiry subsequently blamed ‘evangelical Christians’ for the scare. Flowers maintained a high profile, sitting on committees and getting himself involved in community projects. Ironically, given recent events, from 1992 to 2004 he was prominently involved with the Lifeline Project, which helps drug abusers. Today he remains a trustee of the Terrence Higgins Trust, the HIV/Aids charity. Reverend Paul Flowers used his Co-op bank email account to organise nights with a £650-per-session rent boy, it emerged today. The disgraced Methodist minister, 63, who was forced to quit his £130,000 role in June, organised drug-fuelled gay sex at hotels while he was still in the job, according to the escort involved. Emails reveal he would pay for threesomes, taking the rent boys for expensive dinners before going to bed together. Arrangement: Reverend Paul Flowers, pictured in front of MPs this month, used his company email to set up dates with rent boy Ciaron Dodd, who charged up to £650-a-night . The liaisons were organised while he was running the Co-Op bank, which at the time he was in charge lost £700million. 'I knew what he did for a living and couldn't believe how debauched he was,' escort Ciaron Dodd, 21, told The Sun. 'Every . time he saw me he knew he was risking everything — but he just didn't . seem to care. He took me to the theatre and gave me presents like . chocolate and wine. I was old enough to be his grandson but he didn't . seem to think we looked like the odd couple.' The emails from Flowers' Co-op account reveal how he was happy to discuss sex and drugs, despite his public position. One email to the rent boy says: 'Been waiting for you to come and have some coke (cocaine) and k (Ketamin) with me. P x.' Email chain: Rev Flowers admitted he had threesomes in the past, but could only afford one rent boy on this occasion . Drug reference: This email, also sent to Ciaron says he wanted to take cocaine and ketamin with him . In another exchange, the rent boy asks if he can bring his friend Lucas. Flowers replied: 'I like him a lot - but I can't afford 2 of you this time! PXx'. According to his Facebook page Mr Dodds lives in Warrington, Cheshire and is a 'part time model' working in the catering industry. But the page was taken down after friends began to post messages attacking him for going public about his meetings with Flowers. He claimed the relationship ended when Flowers refused to pay £2,000 he owed.","Reverend Paul Flowers was caught performing sex act with man in 1981 .

"Read Matt Lawton and Ian Ladyman on Dave Whelan's outburst . Even when it was spelt out to him, even when the conversation ventured into the history of slavery, Dave Whelan could not grasp what the problem was. He became confused, exasperated. ‘I don’t know what all this is about,’ he said on Thursday. Just as Wigan Athletic’s 77-year-old owner could see no issue with appointing Malky Mackay as his new manager when the Scot remains the subject of an FA investigation into allegations of racism, sexism and homophobia, he could not understand why anything he had said might also offend people. Dave Whelan in 2013 with the FA Cup after Wigan stunned Manchester City at Wembley . Whelan caused a stir over his appointment of Malky Mackay earlier this week . His defence was one we hear all too often, even in 2014. He spoke the language of the bigot, arguing that there was no difference between abusing someone for being Chinese and calling a white English person a ‘Limey’. I’ve known Whelan for years, and he once asked me to write his book. We got as far as writing a synopsis before I stood down as his ghost because I realised I didn’t have the time. But his life story was fascinating, and not just because he once declined an invitation to buy Manchester United for £11million because he feared football fans who did not follow United might boycott his sports stores. There was a story from his childhood during the Second World War. He jumped on a bus in Wigan one day and asked a soldier sitting opposite him if he could hold his rifle. The soldier asked where he was getting off. He then asked which street he lived in. And then the number of his house. ‘David?’ asked the soldier. ‘Yes?’ said young Whelan. ‘David, I’m your dad,’ said the soldier. The story highlights the fact that Whelan is of a certain generation; a man who has failed to evolve if we first assume that his comments are not motivated by racial hatred. I don’t believe that they are. But what I do wonder is if this powerful and immensely wealthy man has ever had his views challenged before Thursday night. Iain Moody and Mackay are the subject of an ongoing FA investigation . Premier Range ended their sponsorship deal with Wigan over Mackay’s appointment . There was nobody in his immediate circle strong enough to stop him pressing ahead with the appointment of Mackay. At first last night he had no recollection of even giving an interview to The Guardian. ‘I’ve not given an interview today,’ he said. And then, when reminded of the anti-Semitic remarks he is reported to have made, he replied: ‘What the lad says was some Jewish person liked money, and I said of course Jewish people like money. We all like money. Jewish people are no different than us.’ There can be no disputing what he said in that car crash of a Press conference at Wigan the previous day. Whelan described Mackay as ‘unlucky’ and said he could see little wrong with the deeply offensive comments his new manager had made in a series of text messages and emails. I asked him if he realised the damage he had done. ‘Malky criticised somebody and called them a name,’ he said. ‘We all get called names. We get called Limeys, Brits. The Scots get called Jocks. And we don’t take a blind bit of notice.’ I then asked him if he realised there was a distinction that needed to be recognised. ‘There’s a big difference if you criticise a black person because that is something I would never ever do or agree to,’ he said. But did he understand why? ‘I would never even dream of that,’ he said. ‘That is something that is totally taboo. Everybody on the planet is equal.’ In 2011 Whelan gave a radio interview saying black players were ‘out of order’ to complain when racially abused on a football pitch. He said he remembered the interview. ‘I believe we are all equal,’ he repeated. Still not convinced he appreciated why there was a difference between calling someone a ‘Limey’ and racially abusing a black person, I raised the subject of slavery. He agreed slavery was ‘wrong’. I go to Barbados a lot,’ he said. ‘I have friends, black people, white people, everybody is the same.’ Mackay was unveiled at a press conference at the DW Stadium on Wednesday . How did he feel about a company terminating their sponsorship of Wigan shirts? ‘I’m sorry,’ he said. ‘It’s a free world and they’ve made the decision that they want to take.’ But was he not concerned he had damaged the reputation of a football club he has done so much to establish in the modern era? ‘I hope I’ve not, because I have no intention of doing that,’ he said. ‘But I think when it gets to the end of the season there may be a big change in attitude, even after a few games. Matt Lawton’s August exclusives led the way over Mackay, who was back at Wigan on Wednesday . 'The man we have appointed, he’s a very honest and open man. He’s done something wrong. He’s made the apology. Let’s forgive and forget.’ As Whelan is about to discover, it is not that simple. There will be consequences and they could go way beyond joining Mackay on an FA charge. They could end with his legacy at Wigan seriously damaged, and that would be a pity when I’m not sure he will ever understand why. Mackay could still face disciplinary action from the Football Association . We wish to make it clear The FA investigation into the conduct of Malky Mackay and Iain Moody remains ongoing and no assurances have been given by The FA as to the outcome of this case. In the particular and exceptional circumstances of this case, The FA would like to provide some clarification as to the status of the investigation. The FA did not come into possession of the relevant evidence relating to the messages until mid-October. This came out of many thousands of emails and texts and we are still in the process of obtaining additional information. The FA is still investigating whether these messages indicate a culture in which other acts of a discriminatory nature may have taken place. This process inevitably takes time. Both Mr Mackay and Mr Moody are fully co-operating with the ongoing process. We fully appreciate the need to act expeditiously on this matter. However, it remains a complex investigation and The FA will make no further comment at this time.","Latics chief has faced a backlash over his appointment of Malky Mackay .

"The fear of being involved in an incident at 30,000ft is the reason some people won't step foot on a plane. And for frequent flyers, knowing what to do if there's an on board emergency is vital. With that in mind, British Airways has released a video of its course which allows passengers to experience what a plane crash would feel like. Brace! Brace! A new video shows what goes on in British Airways' simulated plane evacuations . The footage shows what happens on the Flight Safety Awareness Course in London - taking place inside a  Boeing 737 cabin simulator. As well as a smoke-filled cabin and passengers' screams, the crew can be heard shouting the emergency 'brace! Brace!' as participants adopt the position. They then experience an evacuation - and jump down the emergency slide. Andy Clubb, safety instructor for British Airways, said: 'All simulated, all safe, and it's quite a lot of fun, but it's very thought-provoking.' 'Everybody loves a bouncy castle': Jumping down the evacuation slide is most people's highlight . The half-day course costs £135 and takes place at BA's Cranebank training centre near Heathrow. 'Here we train our 17,000 cabin crew and 4,000 pilots in all their emergency and evacuation training, Clubb said. 'We do exactly what we train the cabin crew to do. 'Jumping down the evacuation slide is probably most people's highlight on the course. No matter how old you are, everbody loves a bouncy castle. Although it's great fun, we're doing it so that we can train people to do it the correct way and the safe way. Entertaining and educational: Safety Instructor Andy Clubb says the course is 'fun, but very thought provoking' Instructors, all former cabin crew or flight engineers, teach participants how to open real aircraft doors and over-wing exits, fit life jackets, and go through a smoke chamber. 'One of the most frequently asked questions is about the brace position, and certainly the brace position for us is the most important thing,' Clubb said. 'Everyone has their version of it.' The instructors observe how each person performs the brace position, and advise on whether they are doing it safely and correctly. 'Customers will learn what they should and should not do in just about any emergency situation that could happen on an aircraft, any airline’s aircraft,'  Clubb told MailOnline. Heads down: Instructors observe each person's brace position and advice on doing it correctly . In the video, one participant agrees: 'Next time I fly I will be putting my hand under the seat to check [the life jacket] is where they say it is. It's just made think a little bit more next time I travel.' Since its inception in 2003, more than 15,000 people have taken the course. While most participants are employees of corporate companies, individuals are able to participate in classes with spare places available. The recent air disasters have not resulted in an increase in bookings for the course so far, Clubb says. 'Most courses are booked by people who have heard about the course from previous delegates who have recommended it to colleagues and friends,' he says. Popular: Since its inception in 2003, more than 15,000 people have taken the course . 'It ultimately demonstrates just how safe flying is.' The Flight Safety Awareness Course was originally designed for the petrochemical industry who fly their staff to wherever oil and gas is located in the world. 'This can be in some very remote and unusual places that are not always served by national airlines,' Clubb said. 'They request the course as part of their Corporate and Social Responsibility towards their staff.'","Flight Safety Awareness Course in London costs £135 .

'There will be certain people who are regulars but so much has happened since we qualified. Those who were fringe players might not be now, which is how it should be.

"Retreat: Chancellor George Osborne has backed down on two particularly unpopular parts of his March Budget but many may still pay more for their pasty if it is warmed after baking . Millions are celebrating today as the hated ‘pasty tax’ is to be reversed after a huge campaign across Britain caused a Government U-turn. But it appears many could still end up paying around 50p more if they want the delicious snack piping hot. George Osborne has decided that as long as hot takeaway food is cooling naturally, it will not be subject to 20 per cent VAT, as planned. Greggs, Britain's biggest high street baker, does not reheat food and is celebrating this morning as it will no longer be forced to put up its prices and potentially sack staff. Its shares, which plunged by 15% when the tax was announced in March, have jumped up 30p with today's news. But controversially, as many pasties are kept warm in smaller bakeries under lights or on hot plates, the tax will still apply to these purchases, raising its cost to an average of £3. The price increase, up from an average of £2.50, will also apply to ones kept in foil or packaging that keeps it hot, or reheated in a microwave. Only pasties, and other hot snacks like sausage rolls and pies that are served straight from the oven or are allowed to cool down in a glass cabinet, will continue to be tax-free. So unless pastry enthusiasts time their trip to the bakery just as they are just baked they will have to pay more for a warm one. In a letter to the Treasury select committee the Chancellor will also announce a retreat on another controversial measure in his badly received March Budget - a proposal to levy VAT at 20 per cent on static holiday caravans. Instead, they will be subject to just five per cent VAT. Both VAT rises prompted uproar among Tory MPs in the regions -- with particular anger in the South West at the pasty tax and in the North over the caravan levy. Mr Osborne has now had to stage three retreats over measures in his Budget, which is blamed by many MPs for starting a slump in the polls for the Conservatives. He has already had to announce a £30million compensation fund for churches that would have been hit by plans to start levying VAT on alterations and improvements to listed buildings. Exemption: The change means food that is allowed to cool in a glass cabinet, such as these pasties in a branch of Greggs, will still be VAT-free . But the rethink on the pasty tax, following a consultation period which has seen bakers march on Downing Street and Ed Miliband visit a branch of Greggs to protest, will be greeted with delight on the Tory backbenches. Tory MP for Camborne and Rerduth, George Eustice, who has led a campaign for a U-turn, said: ‘This is very good news. It is everything we and the industry have asked for. ‘The key principle is that provided no attempt is made to keep pasties hot, and they’re just cooling naturally, then they will be exempt from VAT. That’s pretty much the position now. ‘Everyone knows Cornish pasties are best eaten lukewarm. This shows we have got a Government that’s doing genuine consultations and listening to public concerns. Backlash: Hundreds of bakers protest outside Downing Street during a day of action over the controversial 'pasty tax' late last month . ‘This will catch what was always the stated target -- supermarkets selling hot rotisserie chickens which they keep hot for hours and sell in foil packaging, and then don’t pay VAT.’ Complex rules: Pasties left to cool naturally are to be exempt, but food in foil packaging is not . MPs from all three main parties had warned ministers the original proposal was unenforceable and would hit jobs and businesses. VAT is not charged on most food and drink or hot baked goods but is payable on takeaway food sold to be eaten hot. However, hot savouries including pasties and pies are currently exempt. Ministers originally suggested that all food sold ‘above ambient temperature’ should be subject to VAT to close the loophole. Now, Treasury sources said it would only be applied to food which is kept hot, or where the natural cooling process is delayed – for instance, where businesses keep food hot in heated cabinets, or under hot plates and heat lamps. It will also be levied where food provided in heat retaining packaging or other packaging specifically designed for hot food – for example foil-lined takeaway packaging for Indian and Chinese takeaways. However, it will not be applied to pasties or pies cooling in glass cabinets or displays. A Treasury spokesman said: ‘The Budget announced a consultation on a change to VAT on hot take-away food, designed to remove inconsistency and ambiguity in the system and level the playing field across the take-away food market. ‘After extensive engagement we have improved the policy, addressing practical concerns, ensuring that the new regime could be as simple as possible to apply. We have addressed these in a way that allows us to remove the inconsistent VAT treatment, while not imposing any additional requirement on businesses to test the temperature of their products.’ Tory MP Graham Stuart, who organised a mass petition of Parliament by more than 25 MPs, welcomed the move on the caravan tax. He said: 'We are delighted. It is a victory for the campaign to persuade the Government to think again. The Government’s U-turns on charging VAT on pasties and static caravans will add £110 million to the deficit, Labour has claimed. Shadow Treasury minister Lord Eatwell challenged ministers on why the change was not announced in Parliament. During questions in the House of Lords he asked what other uses for the £110 million had been considered by the Treasury. Lord Eatwell said: 'The Government’s announcement on VAT yesterday will add £110 million to the annual deficit and cumulatively to the public debt.' He asked Treasury Commercial Secretary Lord Sassoon to 'explain to the House why the announcement was not first made in Parliament, in contravention of the ministerial code.' He joked: “And does VAT now apply to humble pie?” Meanwhile Tory peers have defended the decision. Lord Sassoon said: 'On a number of issues, including the VAT changes, we said we would consult. 'We have consulted and come up with what we believe is a the right approach having talked to a range of interested parties.' 'Many backbenchers and, privately, ministers behind the scenes talked to the Government and we were successful in persuading them to review the original decision. 'It is great news for the manufacturing industry and also for the park and coastal communities all around the country.' Mr Stuart said he was happy with the compromise, acknowledging the state of the economy and the need to raise revenue. Liberal Democrat MP Stephen Gilbert welcomed the pasty tax move after tabling an early day motion and raising the issue at Prime Minister's Questions. He said: 'The Cornish people have won and there will be dancing in streets from Land's End to the Tamar as people hear that the Government has dropped their plans to clobber local people and local businesses with this tax. 'The strength of feeling from local people and the national baking industry has been clear since these proposals were announced. 'Plans to extend VAT to batch-baked goods would have been unfair, unenforceable and would have cost jobs and investment across the country. 'Since the Budget, I have worked with the industry to find an alternative and I'm delighted that the Government has listened and agreed. 'This alternative, that I proposed in meetings with the minister and through parliamentary debates, is a workable solution that creates a level playing field with other sorts of hot food and won't endanger jobs, investment or growth.' Chancellor George Osborne caved in on his plans to charge the 20% rate of VAT on hot baked snacks such as pasties and pies and this has helped Britain's biggest baker. The climbdown, which followed a campaign to scrap the tax that was supported by 300,000 signatures, saw Greggs shares rise 9% today. They are up 30p to nearly £5 this morning and rising further. Last month Greggs revealed a 1.8% drop in like-for-like sales in the 19 weeks to May 12 abnd warned it would be under sustained pressure because of the tax rise. Greggs chief executive Ken McMeikan said today: 'This is fantastic news for the customer more than anything. 'If we had to put up prices by 20% in the current marketplace when consumers are having a very difficult time we expected there would be an impact on sales but we don't know what it would have been. 'I think the Government deserves to be applauded.'","George Osborne says pasties straight from the oven or cooling naturally will now be exempt from VAT .

"An Asda supermarket worker who stole hundreds of pounds in donations after having her head shaved for a cancer charity has walked free from court. Mother-of-two Sandra Ramsay, 36, of Mow Cop, Staffordshire, took part in the event to support her friend and work colleague Deb Barnett, 43, who beat breast cancer. The pair, who both worked at Asda, raised £496.49 last November - but instead of giving the cash to the Breast Cancer Care charity, Ramsay kept it for herself. Head shaving: Mother-of-two Sandra Ramsay (right), 36, of Mow Cop, Staffordshire, took part in the charity event to support her friend and Asda colleague Deb Barnett (left), 43, who beat breast cancer . A court heard she spent the money on presents for her children and lunches out. She also stole £123.21 from the supermarket along with a selection of children’s clothes. On Friday, she was ordered to pay £650 compensation, and received a 12-month community order after she admitted the thefts at North Staffordshire Magistrates' Court in Newcastle-under-Lyme. Avoided jail: Ramsey (pictured) was ordered to pay £650 compensation after she admitted the thefts at North Staffordshire Magistrates Court . Ramsay was also ordered to carry out . 60 hours of unpaid work and told her to pay £310 court costs. She has now . been sacked by Asda. The . court heard her theft was exposed when she was caught stealing clothes . and cash from the supermarket and her bosses called the charity to raise . their concerns. Steve Knowles, prosecuting, said: ‘The defendant, along with another colleague, took part in a sponsored head shave in November for the Tickled Pink cancer campaign through the Asda Foundation. 'Due to the previous incidents, the store manager phoned the charity to see if the money had been passed on. 'She contacted the Asda Foundation and they confirmed no money had been handed in. The defendant was interviewed. 'In relation to the sponsorship, she said she collected the money in good faith and had intended to pass it on, but since Christmas she kept dipping into the money for personal reasons, including to buy dinner and presents for her children. 'She said she didn’t go over the top, it was just £10 or £20 at a time but before she knew it, it had gone.’ David Green, defending, said: ‘This is an extremely sad situation in terms of Mrs Ramsay’s personal life. The thefts were of relatively low value and were unsophisticated offences. ‘There was no attempt to place the blame on somebody else. When Mrs Ramsay raised this money for charity, she clearly intended for that money to go to charity. ‘She then gave in to the temptation of having that money and began dipping into it, not to live an extravagant lifestyle, just to buy lunch and some things for her children. 'She said she didn’t go over the top, it was just £10 or £20 at a time but before she knew it, it had gone' Steve Knowles, prosecuting . ‘By the time Mrs Ramsay had recognised what she had done it was too late. She had spent it all and there was no way of putting it back again. She says she feels ashamed and devastated.’ Ramsay was working at Asda’s store in Wolstanton, Staffordshire, when she suggested holding a charity head shave after being inspired by the bravery of her colleague Ms Barnett. Ms Barnett, of Fenton, had a tumour removed from her breast in 2008 and was given the all-clear last year. Ramsay refused to comment outside court after she was sentenced.","Sandra Ramsay, 36, took part in head shaving event to support her friend .

"Back in 2001, GHD launched its first straighteners - and transformed the hair of an entire nation. Twelve years on, and GHD is launching a new straightener which promises even faster styling for the most unruly hair. But it’s up against some pretty stiff competition. From straighteners infused with keratin and argan oil to steam shots and irons with built-in combs and heat protection, it’s no longer just about two heated ceramic plates. With the help of Mark Smith, senior stylist at John Frieda, we put some of the latest designs to the test . . . Banishing curls: Claire tries the Mark Hill straighteners . Simple but effective: Cloud Nine Micro Iron . Cloud Nine Micro Iron, £54.95, cloudninehair.com . They say: At ‘only six inches in length’ this iron is undoubtedly micro and billed as ‘perfect for styling on the go’. Temperature: 150c. Mark’s view: A simple-to-use and good-quality mini iron. You wouldn’t want to use them on a lot of hair, but they’d be great around the hairline, and because they have a relatively low fixed temperature it means you’re less likely to fry the hair in this area, which tends to need lower temperatures as it’s finer. Verdict: 4/5 . Best for: Short hair, or someone who can justify having a second pair specifically for the hairline, or touch-ups. Get what you pay for: GHD Eclipse . GHD Eclipse, £195, ghdhair.com . They say: ‘Breakthrough patented tri-zone technology’ means there are six sensors in the plates which maintain a constant temperature, so even the unruliest hair only needs a single stroke. Temperature: 185c. Mark’s view: GHD established the market for straighteners in the UK and this new pair upholds its reputation. I like the idea of a fixed temperature, as too often people straighten at 230c, which is just too high. These have no gimmicks, they feel good, glide well and have rounded edges so you can use them to curl, too. The Rolls-Royce of irons,  but I’m not convinced they need to be so pricey - and this loses them a point. Verdict: 4/5 . Best for: Those who want the best and are prepared to pay for it. Best for thick hair: L'Oreal Steampod . L'Oreal Steampod, £150, lorealprofessionel.co.uk . They say: The accompanying water reservoir helps ‘deliver a continuous flow of high-pressure steam’. Temperature: Five settings, ranging from 170c to 210c. Mark’s view: In the salon, we never use steam to straighten hair and we’d  never advise using irons on wet hair, as it’s more prone to damage when wet. These certainly left hair wet after the first stroke. I don’t think for most people the result justifies the hassle and the high price. Verdict: 2/5 . Best for: Thick, coarse hair that’s difficult to blow-dry. Don't bother: Nicky Clarke Salon Pro Straightener with Comb . Nicky Clarke Salon Pro Straightener with Comb, £49.99, nickyclarke.com . They say: A built-in comb that gives hair ‘a smooth and shiny look and keeps a natural-looking amount of volume’, plus a tourmaline plate that helps lock moisture in. Temperature: Six settings up to 230c. Mark’s view: There is some evidence tourmaline can produce ions that help give a smoother finish to hair, but that didn’t help these. The plates didn’t  feel smooth, the controls  were easy to knock and the comb is pointless. Square plates mean you can’t use them to curl. Rubber at the ends to stop you burning your fingers was a nice touch. Verdict: 1/5 . Best for: Sorry, don’t bother, they’re cheap and they feel it. Didn't impress: Toni & Guy Infusion Straightener . Toni & Guy Infusion Straightener, £79.99, boots.com . They say: A ‘unique conditioning treatment reservoir’ in the straighteners is designed to be filled with a heat protection mist. This means, according to the manufacturer, ‘you can skip a step and don’t have to worry about heat damage.’ Temperature: Five settings from 160c to 230c. Mark’s view: The reservoir was really fiddly and made the straighteners very heavy. They didn’t glide through hair like they should and didn’t impress overall. Verdict: 1/5 . Best for: Save your money and buy the Vidal Sassoon ones at the same price instead (right). Reduces damage to hair: Remington Keratin Therapy Pro Straightener . Remington Keratin Therapy Pro Straightener, £89.99, argos.co.uk . They say: ‘Keratin Micro Conditioners are infused in the Advanced Keratin Ceramic coated plates’ and with a ‘heat protection sensor’ that lowers the temperature if your hair is wet to prevent damage. These reduce breakage by up to 57 per cent compared with standard straighteners. Temperature: Five settings from 160c to 230c . Mark’s view: These went through the hair nicely and I like the idea that they adjust the heat if they think it’s damaging your hair. The company says the keratin - a protein that’s an essential part of strong hair - comes to the surface of the plates when you heat them. They guarantee the keratin will last at least five years. If it’s true that’s quite impressive. Verdict: 3/5 . Best for: Anyone who wants to minimise damage to their hair. Style over substance: Mark Hill Sleek & Chic Iconic Super Styler . Mark Hill Sleek & Chic  Iconic Super Styler, £99.99, boots.com . They say: Ceramic plates are infused with Moroccan argan oil, which helps them ‘glide through each section to smooth, remove frizz, condition and add amazing shine’. Temperature: Eleven settings from 120c to 220c. Marks’ view: Once you get over the garish animal print styling - they come in different colours, too - they slide through the hair really nicely. The argan oil is a bit gimmicky because while it does make the plates smoother so they glide through the hair more quickly, you’re not left with any oil on your hair so it’s a bit misleading. It’s not bad, but it seems like more of a fashion item. Verdict: 3/5 . Best for: Trend-obsessed teens. Not bad: Vidal Sassoon Detox Salon Series Titanium Styler . Vidal Sassoon Detox Salon Series Titanium Styler, £79.99, boots.com . They say: Heated plates are coated in 100 per cent titanium ‘which helps to reduce the build up of bacteria and provide hair with maximum moisture protection’. Temperature: Five settings from 150c  to 230c . Mark’s view: These feel more expensive than they are, they’re not too heavy and the temperature gauge is in a sensible place. I’d argue ‘build up of bacteria’ isn’t a real problem for straighteners, but they went through the hair well and didn’t catch too badly when I used them to curl. Verdict: 4/5 . Best for: An everyday straightener and a more pocket-friendly price than GHDs.","GHD is launching a new straightener which promises even faster styling .

"A recent Canadian news article showcasing a New York City artist who makes millions from her invisible works of art has been revealed to be a joke. Though intended as a satire, the September piece on CBC.com about 27-year-old Lana Newstrom, who told the site her 'art is about imagination,' managed to infuriate art world critics who didn't get the joke. Now the writers and readers who cried 'the emperor has no clothes' are the ones left with their pants down. Who's laughing now? Two prankster Canadian radio hosts duped a bunch of media types with a hoax story about a New York artist whose 'invisible' works of art fetch millions of dollars . Guardian art blogger Jonathan Jones wrote on Tuesday that the outrage that grew out of the misunderstood joke because so many are 'shocked and repelled by the art market' and of 'the image of rich people forking out for invisible art.' The CBC article, which was penned by radio pranksters Pat Kelly and Peter Oldring, quoted Newstrom's imaginary art dealer as saying 'her invisible works can fetch upwards of a million dollars.' Jones points out just a couple of the gullible outlets who had knee-jerk reactions to the piece, including sports website Barstool. 'If you’re some artsy fartsy idiot paying money for invisible art, you GOTTA kill yourself,' they wrote. The CBC report was shared and liked tens of thousands of times and the comments sections lit up after outlets reported the hoax as fact, with many readers ridiculing the fictional young woman and her nonexistent art. Another piece published at CBC revealed the pranksters intentions with the joke. 'In the arts, there is much room for interpretation and we thought it would be interesting to push the idea to the extreme–invisible art,' said Pat Kelly. While the audio piece posted along with the CBC article seems to make all but clear that there isn't actually a Lana Newstrom, someone did to the trouble of creating a website and social media accounts for her. 'Just because you can’t see anything, doesn’t mean I didn’t put hours of work into creating a particular piece,' Newstrom writes on the site, where titles like 'Transparent Baloon' and 'Tough Day' are posted below empty spaces. Obviously a joke: The fictional artist, 27-year-old Lana Newstrom, even has a website of her 'works' where titles like 'Strawberry' and 'Tough Day' accompany nothing but empty space .","A September article by CBC showcased an artist named Lana Newstrom who claimed her work is 'about imagination'

"Legal clerk and environmental activist Erin Brockovich has opened up about her drunken boating arrest, saying it was a humiliating experience and that she's 'very sorry for it.' Brockovich 52, told Katie Couric that she had several drinks on the day of her arrest. She admitted to getting behind the wheel of her boat after drinking and also confirmed that she threw her cell phone into Lake Mead in Nevada just before her arrest. News of her arrest went viral online, with her haggard-looking mugshot attracting more than 100 million hits alone. Scroll down for video . Legal clerk and environmental activist Erin Brockovich has opened up about her drunken boating arrest . She admitted to getting behind the wheel of her boat after drinking and also confirmed that she threw her cell phone into Lake Mead in Nevada just before her arrest . Brockovich, who was famously portrayed by Julia Roberts in a movie about her life, said she is frightened of going to jail over the arrest . 'I'm embarrassed, to say the least - humiliated. And not about the photo,' Brockovich said in the interview with Couric. 'I made a bad choice and a mistake and I'm very sorry for it.' Brockovich, who was famously portrayed by Julia Roberts in a movie about her life, said she is frightened of going to jail over the arrest and that her lawyer thinks she will just have to pay a fine. On the night of the incident, arresting officer Kasen Haslem reported that she appeared 'highly intoxicated' as she argued with her husband,  Eric L. Ellis, aboard a boat docked at the Las Vegas Boat Harbor on Lake Mead. The mother of three later registered a blood alcohol content of .190 - more than twice the legal limit of .08. Haslem was fueling up his own boat when he spotted the couple around 7:30 p.m. 'I watched as she threw a cell phone form the boat into the water,' he wrote. 'She then walked by her husband and she appeared to slap him.' Explaining her haggard mugshot, Brockovich said she had recently gotten plastic surgery under her eyes and that the red marks which appear in the photo are a result of the surgery . Explaining the fight with her husband to Couric, Brockovich said she was cleaning up bottles in the cabin under the boat when, unbeknownst to her, her husband fell in the water. When she came up from the cabin, she said she was surprised to see that he was soaking wet and he was angry she hadn't helped him when he fell in the water. Brockovich, (right), allegedly threw a cell phone into the water and then slapped her husband, Eric Ellis, (left) 'Our voices are raised at that point because he was irritated and then I was irritated,' she said. That's when she threw her phone in the water, she added. 'It was a very quick husband-wife, 15-years-being-married kind of [fight] like, ""Why are you yelling at me?""' she explained. Brockovich also explained why her mugshot was so unflattering. She said she had recently gotten plastic surgery under her eyes and that the red marks which appear in the photo are a result of the surgery. Pressed by Couric, she vehemently denied that she has a drinking problem. 'Oh no, I don't. I absolutely do not,' she said. In arresting documents, Haslem stated that Brockovich's answers to his questions were 'very slurred.' 'She also kept straying from the conversation and repeating herself,' he wrote in a police report, adding, 'I could also smell an alcoholic beverage on her breath.' Haslem performed field sobriety tests . and she failed nearly every one of them, he said. She was later booked . into jail and released on a $1,000 bail. Brockovich has since apologized for . her arrest in a written statement, but her interview with Couric is the first time she has talked about it publicly. Under Nevada law, a first-time offense of boating while intoxicated is a . misdemeanor that draws fines from $1,000 to $2,000 but no jail time. Authorities were unsure whether it was Brockovich's first arrest on the . charge. Brockovich, who married her third . husband, Eric L. Ellis, in 1999, became a worldwide celebrity after the . 2000 Steven Soderbergh film about her life. As a legal assistant she helped win a . record $333 million settlement from a power company after dozens of . people were poisoned by chemicals released into the water supply in the . California town of Hinkley. After suffering an injury in an auto . accident, Brokovich hired the California law firm Masry and Vititoe to . represent her in a civil lawsuit against the other driver. While the . firm won her a small settlement, the single mother needed a job to . support her family. Boating blunder: Brockovich, famous for acting as an advocate for residents of Hinkley, California, against the Pacific Gas and Electricity Company, was recently arrested for DUI . Case closed: Julia Roberts won an Oscar for her portrayal of Erin Brockovich in the movie of the same name . The law firm hired Brokovich as a . file clerk, which is what ultimately launched the former Miss Pacific . Coast's career in law and public advocacy. While organizing files for a pro-bono . real estate case, Brokovich uncovered medical records that would lead . to the largest settlement ever paid out in a direct action lawsuit in . U.S. history. Brokovich's investigation found that . the Pacific Gas and Electric company had been poisoning Hinkley . residents for more than 30 years. Between 1952 and 1966, the company . used the chemical hexavalent chromium (often referred to as Cr-6) to . fight corrosion in the cooling tower in the Hinkley compressor, which . was part of a natural gas pipeline connecting much of northern . California to the San Francisco Bay area. Brockovich is pictured in March 2000 in her home in Agoura Hills, California . The waste water dissolved the Cr-6 and it ended up in unlined ponds near the cooling tower. The Cr-6 then found its way into the groundwater, contaminating a two-by-one-mile area around the plant. Because of Brokovich's research, more than 600 Hinklley residents shared the giant $333 million settlement. For her work, Brokovich was given a $2 million bonus. Julia Roberts won a Best Actress Oscar for her portrayal of Brockovich in the self-titled movie about the case. Brokovich and Masry then became the . face of environmental litigation and went on to file several lawsuits . against various corporations for pollution issues. Since the film, Brockovich has become a high profile campaigner and TV star with her own series, 'Final Justice.' Just last year, Brockovich was back . on the big screen in the documentary 'Last Call at the Oasis,' which . explores challenges related to the planet's dwindling and increasingly . polluted water supply. Brockovich was released from jail after posting $1,000 bail .","The 52-year-old says admitted to throwing her cell phone in the water and getting behind the wheel of a boat after several drinks .

"Roy Keane is set to be named Celtic manager after a flurry of bets were placed on the Irish assistant manager taking over at Parkhead as successor to Neil Lennon. The odds on Keane being appointed as the next Celtic supremo were dramatically slashed from 33/1 to even money – one firm, BetVictor, went to 8/11. While betting indicators are not always reliable, Sportsmail understands that Keane is on the brink of being appointed by the Parkhead hierarchy. VIDEO Scroll down to Look back at Roy Keane being unveiled as Ireland assistant manager . New job: Roy Keane, the Ireland assistant manager, is set to be named as the new Celtic boss . Still got it: Keane on the ball during an Ireland training session ahead of Saturday friendly with Italy in London . Green light: Ireland manager Martin O'Neill said he will not stand in the way if his right-hand man Keane wants to move to Parkhead . Though Malky Mackay, Owen Coyle, Oscar Garcia and Henrik Larsson have also been considered, Keane has won the race. Martin O’Neill has predicted Keane will return to frontline club management and had stated he would not stand in his way should his right-hand man express a desire to move on – even if the club involved is one O’Neill used to manage. Now that has happened, O’Neill has Steve Walford and Steve Guppy ready-in-waiting to provide coaching back-up with Ireland. Keane is due to speak to the media at the Aviva Stadium on Thursday ahead of Saturday’s friendly against Italy in Craven Cottage. It’s likely one item will dominate the agenda. Discussion: Keane talks to manager Martin O'Neill as coaches Steve Guppy and Steve Walford watch on . Pundits: Keane and O'Neill on air for ITV during coverage of a Champions League tie last season . Old Bhoy: Keane played half a season with Celtic after leaving Manchester United in the 2005-2006 campaign . Earlier this week, Keane spoke of his admiration for Celtic, for whom he played half a season at the end of his career, but declined to push himself forward as a candidate. ‘They are a brilliant club, an absolutely fantastic football club, one of the best in the world. But I have got a job,’ he said. Since becoming Irish assistant manager, Keane has been linked with jobs at Sheffield Wednesday, Nottingham Forest, as an assistant to Louis Van Gaal at Manchester United, and now Celtic. In the frame: Malky Mackay has also been considered as Celtic seek a replacement for Neil Lennon . Shortlist: Owen Coyle, last in employment at Wigan, was also considered by Celtic . His profile has also risen with his ITV work where his presence guarantees high ratings. Celtic are desperate to hire a 'box office' manager who can fill Celtic Park and pick up where Lennon left off. Celtic’s major shareholder, Dermot Desmond, is a close friend of O’Neill and has direct access to discussing Keane’s suitability for the Celtic job, if required. The FAI refused to comment on the rising speculation.","Flurry of bets placed on Irish assistant manager taking over at Parkhead .

"West Ham manager Sam Allardyce's fate will be sealed during showdown talks with the club's hierarchy. Sportsmail revealed last week that the Hammers board have decided to call time on Allardyce's reign at Upton Park. And the manager will be informed of co-owners David Sullivan and David Gold's decision at an end-of-season meeting on Tuesday. Waiting game: Sam Allardyce could be set to stay at the club amidst rumours of his sacking . Questions: Allardyce was asked about his future during the LMA Awards night on Monday . The east London club have been under immense pressure from disgruntled supporters to sack under-fire Allardyce. The 59-year-old has successfully steered the club to top-flight security after a difficult start to the season. But a growing contingent of supporters have turned on the former Bolton boss, despite the team's improvement since the start of 2014. Allardyce's tactics have become a major bone of contention among Hammers fans, and the anger towards the manager from supporters has not gone unnoticed within the corridors of power at Upton Park. And those dissenting voices have pushed the club into taking the decision to axe Allardyce. Work has already begun on identifying Allardyce's replacement. Under pressure: West Ham supporters have turned on the manager and are keen for Allardyce to be sacked . Allardyce has remained bullish about his job prospects in recent weeks despite the unrest; and has continued with his plans for next season. The manager led a strategic planning meeting on Thursday, where various issues including player recruitment and retention were discussed. But behind the scenes, plans were being already made for life without the former Newcastle manager. Defeat: West Ham were beaten on the final day of the season by Man City has the home side won the title . Sections of the Upton Park faithful have been vociferous in their condemnation of Allardyce. A survey of 12,392 Hammers fans taken last month saw 77.95 percent vote in favour of Allardyce leaving the East London club this summer. He was booed by home fans after the final whistle of March's clash against Hull despite winning the match 2-1.","Sam Allardyce's fate set to be sealed during showdown talks with West Ham hierarchy on Tuesday .

"They were the players brought in, invariably at great expense, carrying even greater hope of transforming the fortunes of their new club. A massive £760million was invested over two transfer windows, each addition going on to enjoy varying degrees of success, or otherwise. Here, Sportsmail runs you through our top 10 signings of the 2013-14 Premier League season… . Here's what you could have won, Spurs fans. The Brazilian was all set . for White Hart Lane until Chelsea intervened and took him to west London . in a £32m deal. The energy and endeavour of the livewire midfielder is . in stark contrast to those signings who wound up at Spurs. Only . Christian Eriksen threatened to populate this list, but Willian just . shades it for the final spot in our top 10. Eyes on the prize: Willian almost signed for Spurs while Dejan Lovren is the only defender to make our top 10 . The Croat is the only defender to make our top 10 but his . performances on the south coast this season make him a worthy resident. An £8.5m arrival from Lyon, he is both classy and composed but with no . shortage of steel and has been one of the key components in . Southampton's success this season. Yes, . the Spaniard has fallen away in the second half of the season – his . last league goal came on January 12 – but his impact in the early months . of the campaign was sensational and he has scored 23 goals since his . £20m arrival from Sevilla. In the absence of Sergio Aguero he kept . City's goal return ticking over and his physicality has brought a new . dimension to City's forward line. Fallen away: But Alvaro Negredo, pictured here ahead of Man City's win over Aston Villa, has scored 23 times . Before his £13m move to Goodison Park, the majority of football fans . outside of Wigan did not know their McCarthys from their McArthurs. But . this James has certainly made a name for himself this season. Boasting . brains as well as bite, the Republic of Ireland midfielder is very . quickly becoming a terrace favourite with the Toffees and Roberto . Martinez's decision to bring McCarthy with him to Merseyside has proved . inspired. Doing the business: Nemanja Matic (left) and James McCarthy in action for Chelsea and Everton respectively . At . £21m, the Serb's return to Stamford Bridge came at a hefty cost. Matic, though, could prove a snip. He has added steel and composure to a . Chelsea midfield in desperate need of an anchoring presence in recent . seasons. Matic has done nothing but impress since January and the best . is arguably still to come. Without the loanee's goals Newcastle may well have found . themselves dragged in to a scrap at the bottom of the table. The France . forward has plundered 14 times and will surely start next season playing . Champions League football, as is his wish. Remy is certainly deserving . of the continent's biggest stage on the evidence of this season. In black and white: Loic Remy is set for Champions League football next term after impressing on loan . Players prised from the Dutch league have not always enjoyed a smooth . transition into the English game. Bony, though, has proved a resounding . success; his 24 goals bear testimony to that. Alert, agile and with a . killer instinct, the 25-year-old Ivorian is . deserving of his place in our top five. Initially a loan signing before making permanent his stay in January, . the journeyman midfielder has arguably made the difference in Palace's . survival bid. Indeed, his seven goals in 2014 have all added points to . the tally which sees the Eagles well clear of danger entering the final game. Puncheon . has even been suggested as a wildcard pick for England's World Cup . squad, such has been his form in the second half of the season. Making an impact: Jason Puncheon and Wilfried Bony have starred for Crystal Palace and Swansea in 2013/14 . A loan signing, yes, but shrewd nonetheless. The Belgian's goals – . 14 of his 17 coming in the league – took Everton mightily close to . a Champions League finish. Still . just 20 years old, Lukaku has amplified his reputation as one of the . game's most promising talents and that is before he leads the line for . Belgium at this summer's World Cup. On . the evidence of this season in the blue of Everton, it would be . staggering were he not given a chance in the blue of Chelsea next term, . especially when their frontmen have all failed to outscore their . club-mate. On target: Romelu Lukaku, on loan from Chelsea, has scored 17 goals this term . The £30m capture of the Brazilian anchorman last summer was not met with too much fanfare. It was an under-the-radar signing and so, we assumed, Fernandinho was an understated type happy to go about his business with minimum fuss. The 29-year-old, however, has proved so much more, adding craft, graft and even goals to the City engine room. He has been a real class act but, the factor which sees him elevated to the summit of our list, is his consistency. The former Shakhtar man has been a dependable presence at the heart of a side which looks destined to finish the season as champions. Key man: Fernandinho (right) has starred for Manchester City this season since his £30million summer arrival .","A huge £760m was spent by top-flight clubs over the two transfer windows .

"The Houston Texans beefed up their defensive line by taking extraordinary pass rusher Jadeveon Clowney from the University of South Carolina with the first pick of the 2014 NFL draft on Thursday. The Texans, picking first after a league-worst 2-14 season, kicked off the annual selection party at Radio City Music Hall by taking defensive end Clowney to partner two-time All-Pro DE JJ Watt, the league Defensive Player of the Year in 2012. 'I'm going to do everything I can to help the program,' said Clowney, who registered 24 sacks and 130 tackles in three seasons and became the first sophomore to win the Hendricks Award as the nation's most outstanding defensive end. 'To be the No 1 pick is the greatest feeling in the world.' No 1 pick: Jadeveon Clowney will line up in a fearsome front line for the Houston Texans .

A . freakish athlete, Clowney, who stands 6-feet-5 (1.96 m) and weighs 266 . pounds (121 kg), stunned observers at the NFL Scouting Combine in .

Jacksonville's selection of Bortles seemed to stun the crowd, . many of whom had anticipated that Texas A&M's Johnny Manziel would . be the first quarterback taken in the draft. The first trade of the . draft sent Cleveland's pick to the Buffalo Bills, who used the fourth . pick to take dynamic wide receiver Sammy Watkins of Clemson.

Hard-hitting linebacker Khalil Mack from the . University of Buffalo was taken fifth by the Oakland Raiders ahead of . offensive tackle Jake Matthews of Texas A&M, the latest member of . his illustrious NFL family to join the league. Matthews will be the . seventh member of the clan to play in the league following his . grandfather Clay Matthews Sr., his father Bruce Matthews, uncle Clay . Matthews Jnr, and cousins Clay Matthews III and Casey Matthews, and . brother Kevin Matthews. 'It's been my dream since I was a kid,' the . Falcons player said before being asked about his famed football family. 'That's some big shoes to fill. I'm just so proud to have this last . name, and excited to be on the Atlanta Falcons.'

"It is the news we have all been waiting for. That renowned flag-bearer for the aviation industry, Ryanair, is planning to branch out into the world of package holidays. This famed Irish purveyor of ‘low-cost’ travel has revealed that the grand concept of ‘Ryanair Holidays’ may be only a half-decade away. ‘If it becomes Ryanair Holidays at a point in time, it is a logical way for the brand to go,’ the airline’s chief marketing officer Kenny Jacobs said earlier this week. ‘I can see us launching this in the next five years.’ We're all going on a Ryanair Holiday, no more worries for a week or two: Although not for the next five years . On the off-chance that you can’t wait that long for the tantalising prospect of a Ryanair-assisted escape to a sunny destination (or an east European city you haven’t heard of), here is a preview of what we may (as in won’t at all, really. Because this is satire) all be able to look forward to. It will be the best thing ever. Seriously, 2019 cannot come soon enough. (1) Hotel rooms from just £6.99 a night* . Just look at those eye-catching prices. Amazing, incredible, excellent value for money. And definitely a fair reflection of the true cost of the room. You just need to click through these next seven pages of terms and conditions. Oh, and there may be a couple of little extra fees that bring the price up to £79.99 a night. Oh, and if you could just add in your contact details here, and tick those boxes there, and that’s it – a bargain £111.99 a night. (2) Exciting ways to pay . Did we say £111.99 a night? Sorry, that price only applies if you are paying with the Angolan kwanza or the Mozambique metical (sorry, cash please, notes only). Or if you are using the Super-Duper Ryanair Hotel Cashcard, which is available from literally some outlets in some places. If you want to use a credit or debit card, we’re afraid that there will be a tiny additional charge of £27.99 per booking. Thank you for your understanding. A nice man who will definitely sell you a great holiday. And definitely won't refer to you as an 'idiot'. Oh no . (3) Early-bird check-in times . To enjoy our hotel rooms from £6.99* a night, you will need to check in at the hotel at 4:20am, ahead of being allowed into your room at 6:20am. This is due to the hotels being inflexible in their rules, and charging extortionate fees that are completely beyond our control. Check-in at 2pm is available for a discreet extra fee of £49.99 each . (4) Another teensy-weensy additional cost for checking in . And it really will be teensy-weensy. Just £25.99 (per person, rather than per room. Sorry about that). This is due to the endlessly high cost of running a front desk at a hotel (those little pens with the hotel name written on them do not – we’re afraid – pay for themselves). You can, of course, avoid this almost unnoticeable charge by downloading your own room key onto a piece of paper and bringing it with you. Do not lose your paper key. There will a charge for losing your paper key – and a personal telling-off from the chief executive. Which way to Las Ramblas, mate? Some hotels may be closer to the centre of Barcelona than others . (5) A miniscule extra fee for luggage . Bags are heavy. Carrying a full suitcase along a hotel corridor causes a lot of wear and tear to the fabric of the carpets – especially if you are staying at one of those posh hotels where a nice man in a smart uniform wheels your bag to your room on a trolley, just six hours after you have arrived. With this in mind, there will be an extra fee of just £29.99 per bag (on check-in, and on check-out) to ensure that the hotel carpets do not have holes in them. You can avoid this charge by travelling stress-free, carrying just a convenient purse filled with air. (6) Hotels in not-at-all-misleading places . There will be lots of splendid hotels in lots of brilliant locations – some as close to the city centre as 70 miles away. Book ahead now for first-rate properties in Barcelona (Reus or Girona), Munich (Memmingen) and Venice (Treviso). Other possibilities may include Amsterdam (Beijing), Madrid (Leicester), Prague (Southampton) and Bratislava (Mars). (7) Endless chances to win, win, win . The phone in your room may ring at 3am. ‘Hello. Can I interest you in a scratchcard?’ Would you like a scratchcard? Buy a scratchcard and you can win another scratchcard’. We're all on our way to Munich. Or, at least, an airport that is close to Munich. Depending on you define 'close' (8) Lovely, comfortable, luxury beds . Due to cost constraints and an unfailing commitment to competitive pricing, all beds will be an extremely generous three inches wide by four inches long. The bed of the next hotel guest may be directly in front of your bed. This will not affect the quality of your holiday. (9) Entertaining music on check-out . Once your holiday is over, just as you are leaving the hotel, you will be treated to an in-no-way-annoying tootling of trumpets and the announcement that: ‘You have enjoyed another on-time Ryanair holiday. Last year, 98 per cent of all Ryanair holidays were on time. They were all great, and nobody had any complaints, concerns, gripes or quibbles.’ (10) Hugely helpful and friendly staff . Ryanair chief executive Michael O’Leary once described passengers who fail or forget to print out their own boarding passes as ‘idiots’ who should ‘b***** off’. All hotel staff on Ryanair Holidays will work to similar levels of courtesy, politeness and professionalism. Of course, now that Ryanair has rebranded as a cuddly-wuddly airline, and Mr O’Leary has said that 'being nice to our customers is a new and winning strategy’, all holidays will be gold-plated, wondrous experiences. Oh why must we wait five years, Michael? Why?","Ryanair has revealed plans to start selling package holidays as well as flights .
The service is expected to launch at some point during the next five years .
We take an entirely tongue-in-cheek look at what customers can 'expect'"
"Forever mystery: Melissa Rivers (right) allegedly declined to have an autopsy performed on her mother Joan's (left) body, which would have pinpointed the cause of her death last month . The world will never know what action killed Joan Rivers' after a routine surgery, because her heartbroken daughter told doctors NOT to perform an autopsy. The comedian died last month after a throat surgery left her brain dead. Daughter Melissa Rivers was left so despondent by her mother's sudden and unexpected passing that she specifically requested no autopsy be conducted, TMZ reports. According to New York law, a family member can request that if there's no evidence of criminality associated with the death. Rivers died from a 'predictable' complication involved in the throat procedure, the New York Medical Examiner reported. A further autopsy could have pinpointed what exactly what went wrong during the surgery - such as a puncture in the throat or some other trauma. Yorkville Endoscopy, the clinic where Rivers underwent surgery, has since been deemed  deficient in four major categories required for accreditation following an investigation by the New York State Health Department. If it does not correct these problems, it will lose its license on January 7 of next year. In a October 9 letter to the clinic's director of operations, Tricia Dougherty, obtained by MailOnline, the categories the clinic is 'noncompliant in the following four areas:  'governing body and management, surgical services, medical staff and patient rights.' 'This is a big, big deal,' Dr. Jerome Waye, a Manhattan gastroenterologist who has spoken with physicians on the Yorkville staff about the investigation, told MailOnline. 'They won't be able to take Medicare patients, and that's got to be at least half their clientele.' 'I don't know of any circumstance where the whole Medicare certification is pulled over one doctor doing one procedure,' said Waye. 'I'm quite surprised that Medicare has come down on Yorkville like this,' Waye said. Scroll down for video . TMZ reports that Melissa was so heartbroken in the wake of her mother's sudden passing that she did not want the autopsy performed. Pictured at her mother's memorial service above . Shut down: Yorkville Endoscopy (above) has until January to fix their problems or they will lose their license. Dr. Lawrence Cohen, who was director of the clinic and Joan's gastroenterologist was forced to step down . Waye said it appeared as though the violations were directly related to the Rivers incident. Dr Wayne believes that the violation of patient's rights cited alludes toThe patient's letting someone not certified do the biopsy, violating [Rivers'] rights and and the 'governing body and management' I for them not following protocol in letting the doctor do the unauthorized procedure, . After reading the letter, Dr.Wayne believes that that 'they didn't do much of an investigation, if they didn't find any wrongdoing by the doctors. It looks like they just threw everything they could at [Yorkville], saying you had all these violations, now we're going to take away your certification.' Other specifics are not being disclosed at this time. Deficient: The clinic where Joan Rivers went into cardiac arrest while undergoing routine surgery has been deemed 'deficient' by the New York State Health Department . Furthermore, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Service notified the clinic that it 'no longer meets the requirements for participation as a supplier of services in the Medicare program.' A source close to the investigation confirmed to the MailOnline that Yorkville did, indeed, respond to the Oct. 9th letter with a Plan of Correction within the ten days required by Medicare. The source also confirmed that the investigation resulted from a complaint over the Rivers' incident. This news comes just one day after it was revealed that Rivers died due to a lack of oxygen in her blood. The popular comedian was having routine surgery at Yorkville Endoscopy on August 28. Her gastroenterologist, Dr. Lawrence Cohen, who was in charge of the procedure, has since left the practice. Joan's throat specialist, Dr. Gwen Korovin, was also in the room, when she went into cardiac arrest. On hand: Dr. Gwen Korovin (above), Rivers' throat specialist, was one of the people in the room when the comedian went into cardiac arrest . She was then rushed to Mount Sinai Hospital where she was put into a medically induced coma and then on life support before passing away at the age of 81 on September 4. Following yesterday's news Rivers' daughter Melissa released a statement saying, 'We continue to be saddened by our tragic loss and grateful for the enormous outpouring of love and support from around the world.' The Center for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) spokeswoman Courtney Jenkins, who provided the letter in response to a request about the Rivers investigation, was not immediately available to comment on the letter. Maya Voynarovska, a spokeswoman for Yorkville Endoscopy, was also not immediately available to comment on the letter.","Melissa Rivers asked doctors not to perform an autopsy on her mother Joan Rivers, after the comedian died last month .

"The family of Marvin Gaye has won a round in a court battle over allegations that last year's blockbuster hit song 'Blurred Lines' ripped off the late Motown legend's work. A US federal judge denied a motion today by singer Robin Thicke and songwriter Pharrell Williams, who wanted a court to reject the plagiarism claims made by Gaye's children. A jury will decide their accusations that the 2012 hit song 'Blurred Lines' wrongly copied parts of their father's music in a celebrity trial set for February. U.S. District Judge John A. Kronstadt made the ruling after hearing views by experts for Robin Thicke and Pharrell Williams, and by Gaye's children, over 'Blurred Lines' and Gaye's 'Got to Give it Up'. The federal judge said there was a good argument about whether signature phrases, hooks, bass lines, keyboard chords and vocal melodies in the two songs are the same. An attorney for Robin Thicke, left, and Pharrell Williams, right, is 'confident' the pair will win the celebrity trial . The children of late soul singer Marvin Gaye, pictured, are suing on behalf of their father's estate for plagiarism . But Kronstadt said the jury will not listen to the music, but compare the sheet music. An attorney for Thicke and Pharrell said he was 'confident' the pair would win the upcoming trial. The ruling today came after a court fight that has lasted more than a year. Thicke and Pharrell had sought a motion on Thursday by the judge that 'Blurred Lines' did not infringe on copyrights to the Gaye song. Their attorney, Howard King, wrote in an email that the judge's decision was not a surprise, and he was confident the hit songwriters would win at trial. 'Since the compositions at issue are completely different, we remain confident of prevailing at trial,' King wrote. A representative for Gaye's children, Nona, Frankie and Marvin Gaye III, did not have an immediate comment on the ruling. The Gaye family also claims that 'After the Dance' was improperly used for Thicke's No. 1 R&B hit, 'Love After War.' Kronstadt ruled a trial would be needed to decide that issue as well. The Los Angeles trial is scheduled for February 10, 2015. Thicke and Pharrell, pictured above next to a model in the centre, sing in the controversial 'Blurred Lines' video .

"A mother forced her teenage daughter into prostitution after they started doing drugs together when the girl was just 12, police have said. Suzanne Bobbie Calana, 37, was arrested in Miami, Florida last week after another young girl under investigation for prostitution tipped off police. Her daughter, who is now 16, had been put in the custody of her grandmother after her mother lost her legal parental rights following a long line of drug arrests, the Miami Herald reported. But in May, the girl ran away to live with her mother on the streets and became addicted to cocaine, crack cocaine and Xanax, she told police. Accused: Suzanne Bobbie Calana, 37, allegedly started taking drugs with her daughter when the girl was just 12 and often committed sex acts for money in front of her, teaching her about prostitution, the girl said . She turned to prostitution and sometimes sold her body to give Calana money for drugs. 'The victim explained that she learned about prostitution from her mother,' an arrest report said. 'The victim recalled instances where her and her mother engaged in sexual activities with men, while in the same room, in exchange for money.' Calana then allowed her daughter to move in with suspected drug dealer Lawrence Martin, 43, who is also known as 'Paper', police said. 'Pimp': She allowed her daughter to move in with Lawrence Martin, pictured, who then demanded the girl earn at least $150 a day, police said. He also allegedly had sex with the teenager and gave her drugs . Martin, who was also Calana's pimp, allegedly forced the teenager to earn at least $150 a day, and also had sex with her and gave her drugs, according to the arrest report. He was also arrested last week. Calana and Martin are charged with human trafficking of a minor, furnishing drugs to a minor and interfering with custody. 'Every time you've think you've seen the worst case, another one comes along that is hard to believe,' Miami-Dade State Attorney Katherine Fernandez Rundle told the Herald. Calana's defense attorney declined to comment.","Suzanne Bobbie Calana was arrested in Miami last week on charges of human trafficking of a minor and furnishing drugs to a minor .

"Created: . 06:45 EST, 6 May 2014 . A Harley Street nutritionist has been fined after claiming his fitness regime could combat cancer. Former bodybuilder Dr Stephen Ferguson, 45, provided a range of protein shakes and multivitamin drinks, which had 'cured' two of his clients. The health food range could also heal epilepsy, motor neurone disease and multiple sclerosis, according to his website.

The Harley Street nutritionist told the court he did not know how the word 'cured' came to appear on his website . But today, Dr Ferguson was fined £1,750 for violating the Cancer Act. The act was designed to protect vulnerable people from unprofessional advice. Sentencing, District Judge Adrian Turner told . Hammersmith Magistrate's Court: 'The written material refers to cancer, . with a link to the clinic. 'It is plainly implied this is someone who . treats cancer. 'Any member of the public would believe this is someone who has treated and in two cases cured cancer. 'I’m . satisfied Dr Ferguson was fully involved with everything that’s on his . site and anyone reading this would have no doubt this was an offer of . services for those seeking treatment for cancer. 'I’m . in no doubt those YouTube testimonials are a major part of the . company’s business in treating cancer and Dr Ferguson’s approach to the . Cancer Act has been a head in the sand one.' District Judge Adrian Turner at Hammersmith Magistrate's Court ruled that Dr Ferguson was 'fully involved' Vitamin C capsules sold on Dr . Ferguson's website were captioned with the testimonial: 'Many have said . it helps them get rid of cancer.' Other . products included Multivitamin PH Balancer, Blood Cleanser & Energy . Booster and a Tropical Fruit Whey Protein Powder, which were advertised . as cures for the life-threatening disease, as well as for asthma, . arthritis, and diabetes. It was also implied the clinic was involved in the successful treatment of a patient with prostate cancer. The business flourished between June 17 and October 2 last year, until the council received a complaint. In . a bid to distance himself from the website's content, and video adverts . uploaded to YouTube, Dr Ferguson told the court a female employee was . responsible. 'She was meant to stick to specific guidelines and not put on anything about treating cancer or anything like that,' he said. 'She was asked not to include her own personal views on there. 'I . know it should not say anything that says we are treating cancer. It’s . purely for diet and fitness and exercise and nothing else.' Acknowledging a video strap line that included the word 'cured' for a Merkel cell tumour treatment, Dr Ferguson told the court: 'I don’t know how it got there.' He denied uploading the YouTube content to a page owned by username ‘SFSTEVE100’, and claimed not to know who did. 'I don’t write on my website, I have other people update it for me. I was checking the website, but obviously not everything that went on there, there’s three thousand pages,' he added. The judge also ordered Dr Ferguson to pay £2,500 costs and a £120 victim surcharge, telling him: 'You are not accused of quackery, no one is saying you are not a qualified nutritionist. 'These are reckless offences, not a deliberate attempt by you to exploit the vulnerable.'","Dr Stephen Ferguson, 45, sold vitamin drinks that 'cured cancer patients'

"LA Kings ice hockey star Slava Voynov has been charged with assaulting his wife. The Los Angeles County District Attorney's office has filed a felony case against the 24-year-old old who faces a charge of corporal injury to his spouse with great bodily injury. Voynov was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence in October at a Torrance hospital after bringing his wife, Marta Varlamova, there to seek treatment after he allegedly assaulted her. Charged: Los Angeles Kings defenseman Slava Voynov, pictured, faces a domestic violence charge . Prosecutors said she sustained injuries to her eyebrow, cheek and neck, at their Redondo Beach home, according to the New York Daily News. He is scheduled to appear in court on December 1. If convicted, Voynov could spend up to nine years in prison. However, he remains determined to prove his innocence. Mugshot: Voynov is shown in this Redondo Beach Police Department booking photo following his arrest . His lawyer, Craig Renetzky, said in a statement: 'Mr. Voynov is extremely disappointed that the district attorney's office elected to file charges. 'Mr. Voynov maintains his innocence and looks forward to clearing his name in court. We remain confident.' An attorney for Mr Voynov's wife has also released a statement, denying his client is a victim and that she believes the injuries were an accident. The statement reads: 'Marta was stunned by the news today and she is devastated. She did not believe, and does not believe, that her husband intended to injure her and she believes that he is not guilty of any crime. 'She is worried about her family's privacy and concerned that she and her family are going to be subjected to ridicule, embarrassment and hatred because of this decision. 'In fact, she has already seen that beginning to happen. 'It is unfortunate that no one seemed to care what she wants, and that the authorities gave little or no weight to her view of the facts of the case. 'Despite this unwelcome news, she still expects her husband to be cleared of any criminal wrongdoing.' The NHL suspended Voynov indefinitely for the duration of his proceedings and he has not played since October 19. However, he continues to be paid. NHL deputy commissioner Bill Daly said: 'We are aware of actions taken today in California, which we will review and evaluate before making any decisions. 'Until further notice, the current terms of Mr. Voynov's suspension remain in place.' Voynov only married Marta Varlamova in August 2014, two months before the alleged assault. Family man: Russian-born Voynov, 24, is pictured with his wife Marta Varlamova - who he married in August. The couple have a young daughter. 'Not a criminal': Voynov's wife has spoken through her lawyer to say her husband is not guilty and did not hurt her on purpose. On announcing Voynov suspension, the NHL cited a section of the collective bargaining agreement saying they have power to suspend a player during a criminal investigation if failing to do so 'would create a substantial risk of material harm to the legitimate interests and/or reputation of the league'. The NHL's swift response comes in stark contrast to the NFL, which was criticized for failing to appropriately deal with players facing charges, including Ray Rice and Adrian Peterson. Rice was only suspended for two games from the Baltimore Ravens after he was arrested for hitting his then-fiance in an elevator at a casino in Atlantic City. But after a website shared a video showing him striking her, the NFL banned him indefinitely and the Ravens released him, amid much public uproar. Peterson, a running back for the Minnesota Vikings and a former MVP, was also suspended indefinitely with play by his team after he was charged with child abuse in Texas. He is accused of allegedly whipping his four-year-old son with a tree branch in May. Voynov's swift suspension also comes a year after the NHL failed to comment or enact a suspension when Colorado Avalanche goaltender Semyon Varlamov was arrested on assault charges. Charges in the case were later dropped. Last month, NHL commissioner Gary Bettman spoke about his league's domestic violence policy. Dropped: The NHL's swift response comes after the NFL was widely criticised for its slow response when the Baltimore Ravens' Ray Rice (pictured left) punched his then-fiancee (right) in February . He said: 'Our code of conduct is we expect you to do the right things and if you don't we hold you accountable. More important than that is I believe you need to be proactive,' he said. 'Based on our experience to date, we believe that the appropriate procedures are in effect that we can do what we need to do on a case-by-case basis,' Bettman told The Canadian Press. 'If and when something needs to be addressed in terms of discipline, it will be. But more importantly we try to focus, with the Players' Association, on educating and counselling.' In June 2013, Voynov and the Kings agreed on a six year, $25 million contract extension. The Russian has two assists in six games this season.","Russian-born Los Angeles defenseman charged with injuring his spouse Marta Varlamova .

"Hart's free kick was required to leave the box before the ball could be considered back in play - so by touching it for a second time, he prevented the ball from becoming live. Charlie Austin could have had a first half hat-trick against the Premier League champions on Saturday evening, as he saw two goals disallowed before finally scoring a legitimate goal. Austin powered home a header from a Mauricio Isla cross, only to see the flag go up to deny him a fourth Premier League goal in three games. It looked offside at first glance, and replays confirmed that the striker was several yards beyond the last defender. Mike Dean was at the centre of a major controversy, but the referee got his decision spot on . Charlie Austin heads past Joe Hart, but the flag was rightly up with Austin several yards offside . Austin was celebrating again just moments later, but the officials again ruled the goal out . Free kick inside the penalty area: . Direct or indirect free kick to the defending team: . • the ball is in play when it is kicked directly out of the penalty area . If, when a free kick is taken by the defending team from inside its own penalty area, the ball is not kicked directly out of the penalty area: . • the kick is retaken . Seconds later, from the resulting free kick, Jo Hart appeared to kick the ball straight to Austin, who smashed it emphatically past the England No 1 and began to celebrate. Again, his joy was cut short, this time by referee Mike Dean, as confusion spread around Loftus Road. Again, the officials had got it right. Hart had inadvertently played the ball twice, touching it with his standing foot before scuffing it to Austin. While playing the ball twice from a free kick anywhere else on the pitch would result in an indirect free kick to the opposing side, inside the penalty area things are a bit different. Hart's free kick was required to leave the box before the ball could be considered back in play - so by touching it for a second time, he prevented the ball from becoming live. Joe Hart had inadvertantly touched the ball with his standing foot before connecting with it .

The ball broke to Austin on the edge of the penalty area, but Mike Dean had already blown his whistle . Austin powered home his second disallowed goal in a minute, but the free kick had to be retaken . Dean correctly spotted this, and made him take the free kick again, to QPR's obvious frustration - but correct under the laws of the game.

"A married couple who dress each day in authentic 1950’s outfits are delighted to have reached the final of a national competition celebrating their pastime, overcoming years of torment. Frankie and Melanie Calland, from Howden le Wear in County Durham, are both addicted to dressing in the styles popular over half a century ago, and have suffered years of abuse over their unusual passion. However, the pair refused to be put off, and have now beaten hundreds of other hopefuls to reach the finals Mr Vintage UK and Miss Vintage UK; a national vintage fashion contest. Scroll down for video . As a child Melanie loved old photos with family members dressed in 50s clothing and soon started picking up vintage pieces from jumble sales and second hand shops . Both Melanie and Frankie, pictured with three of the couples five poodles, were individually addicted to clothes dating from the 40's and 50's and when they met it was a match made in heaven . When Melanie and Frankie met in 1988 they bonded over their love of the 1950s, particularly its fashions . Melanie, pictured, and Frankie have dressed every day in period clothing for over 20 years . Frankie, 49, and Melanie, 47, have dressed in authentic 1950s style clothing for over 20 years, despite having had eggs and bricks thrown at their house because of their appearance. 'In the past we'd get abused because of the way we looked.  We had bricks and eggs thrown at our windows and abuse hurled at us in the street.  At the very least we'd get stared at,’ Melanie laments. Both Melanie and Frankie were individually addicted to clothes dating from the 40's and 50's and when they met it was a match made in heaven. As a child Melanie loved old photos with family members dressed in 50s clothing and soon started picking up vintage pieces from jumble sales and second hand shops. The couple, who source their wardrobe through vintage fairs and shops, suffered years of abuse over their lifestyle choice . She went on to fashion college and soon afterwards met Frankie at a Rock n Roll club in 1988, who was also addicted to the fashion of the same era. The pair, who live with their five poodles, continue to dress each day in the style of the 40's and 50's, despite experiencing frightening bullying. In the end the abuse became so bad the couple felt they had no other option than to move house. But in the last couple of years Melanie and Frankie have noticed a sea change in people's attitudes towards them. She says: ‘We now get complimented and I have people asking me where I get my dresses and accessories from. They are genuinely interested and I think it's because it's all on trend at the moment - although Frankie and I have been dressing like this for more than 30 years.’ Melanie, who studied fashion at college, often buys vintage fabrics and sews her own clothes . Melanie spotted the UK vintage fashion competition on Facebook and decided to enter them both . Their incredible wardrobe has been built out of years of scouring vintage fairs with the dedicated couple, who together run fancy dress hire shop called Fantasia, even travelling as far as America to find original clothing. Melanie also buys vintage fabric and makes her own clothes. The couple will now move forward to the finals of Mr Vintage UK and Miss Vintage UK later this month . Recently she spotted the UK vintage fashion competition on Facebook and decided to enter them both. Frankie says: 'We thought it would be a bit of fun, and thought why not?  After all it was right up our street.' The pair beat off hundreds of others, many younger than them, to earn their individual places into final which is being held at the Twinwood Festival in Bedfordshire on August 24. 'I don't know what will happen on the day but we're both excited about it. ‘Frankie’s going to wear a grey New Yorker suit from 1947 or a brown gabardine suit from 1952. ‘As for me I’ll wear a cream and black suit unless it’s boiling hot, then I’ll probably plump for a dress,’ Melanie says. ‘But at the end of the day we’ll just going for the fun of it.  We love the way we dress and we wouldn't change it for the world. 'There's not much style around these days, everything seems so baggy and shapeless and it's all elastic, stretchy stuff which often doesn't look flattering. 'By comparison styles from 40's and 50's are so glamorous and that's why I love wearing them.'","When Frankie and Melanie met they bonded over their love of 1950s style .

"Yaya Toure's form at Manchester City is coming under increasing scrutiny at the highest level of the club after he was sent off during the 2-1 home defeat against CSKA Moscow. Toure, one of the highest-paid players in the Barclays Premier League on £225,000 a week, has yet to rediscover the form that fired City to the title last season. The midfielder, who scored City’s equaliser from a free-kick at the Etihad on Wednesday night, was later sent off for stupidly shoving Roman Eremenko in the face. VIDEOS Scroll down to watch .

Toure lands awkwardly as a foul is given by the Greek referee for the foul by Wernbloom . Toure put in a performance at the Etihad Stadium despite his sublime early free-kick to equalise . Toure, 31, has since apologised to City supporters, but he appears disaffected at the club. He has a contract until 2017 and has one of the biggest bonus packages in the history of English football in his contract. He is paid £823,000 each time City qualify for the Champions League and an extra £412,000 if they win it. That clause is unlikely to be activated any time soon, as the Premier League champions lie bottom of their group without a win. Manuel Pellegrini’s transfer strategy is also coming under increasing scrutiny from Manchester City’s billionaire owner Sheikh Mansour.

"Diego offered to Arsenal as Gunners look to challenge for top spot next season . Manchester City are chasing Marcus Rashford, the 16-year-old rising star at neighbours Manchester United. The attacking midfielder is one of the most highly sought after talents for his age group but United have yet to wrap up terms on a new contract. City are particularly keen while Chelsea and Arsenal also have an interest. United are reluctant to pay out big-money . contracts and constantly risk losing some players due to greater . financial incentives being offered at other clubs. Tug of war: Manchester City are keen to take starlet Marcus Rushford from neighbours Manchester United . Although many would argue United's principled stance is to be admired, the harsh reality is many of the youngsters or their representatives will be swayed by the better contracts. Rashford is a Man United fan and is still committed to the club, but that won't stop rivals from making legitimate offers. There is a growing feeling within United that they will have to bend their past policy if they are to continue to compete. While James Wilson is one shining light on the horizon, they are not blessed with an abundance of prospects and it is a facet of the club David Moyes wanted to address and one Louis van Gaal will do also. The flip side is that the likes of Chelsea and Arsenal have problems when some of their young players sense they will not make any progress and want to leave. Chelsea have an issue arising with highly-rated defender Andreas Christensen. The Denmark U21 centre half wants to play more games and other clubs, such as City, will offer the promise of a quicker route to the first team. Manchester United are expected to place an official bid for Marco Reus at Borussia Dortmund over the coming days but may leave a move for Toni Kroos until next summer when he becomes a free agent. His Bayern Munich team-mate Thomas Muller is also an option for Liverpool and Arsenal who have asked to be kept informed should the German champions consider selling. Arsenal have also enquired about Mario Mandzukic and Javi Martinez and maintain interest in Southampton duo Calum Chambers and Morgan Schneiderlin, as reported in Sportsmail. Hotting up: Manchester United are expected to bid for Borussia Dortmund's Marco Reus shortly . Newcastle, Leicester, Cardiff and Derby County are all considering moves for Leeds United striker Ross McCormack this summer. The 27-year-old scored 29 goals in an eventful season which looks set to take another twist off the pitch with Leeds owner Massimo Cellino facing a winding-up petition from Sport Capital on June 9. Other creditors are also demanding unpaid monies. Leeds rejected offers from Cardiff and West Ham in January and will demand around £10million this window. However, the offers that come in will be around £6m and the player could ask to go if the unrest at Elland Road escalates. Derby will only bid should they gain promotion but Leicester, who also like Brighton's Leonardo Ulloa, are keen. Meanwhile, Newcastle are looking to sell Northern Ireland midfielder Shane Ferguson. The 22-year-old, who had a loan spell with Birmingham earlier in the season, has two years left on contract so Newcastle will look for around £1m. Wolves, Sheffield Wednesday and St Mirren are keen on on out of contract midfielder Conor Newton. Star striker: Leeds marksman Ross McCormack (front) is hot property this summer after plundering 29 goals . Juventus have revived their interest in Manchester City full back Aleksandar Kolarov. The 28-year-old is a popular figure at the Etihad but is interested in a return to Serie A where he has other suitors such as Roma and Inter Milan. His wages of £2.9m a year are a sticking point but Italian champions Juventus are prepared to offer a longer deal on around £2.5m a year. On Wednesday, Juve officials met Kolarov's representatives at the Westin Palace Hotel in Milan and they are due to hold further talks after the weekend before making a proposal to City. The Serbia defender has one year left on contract at City, who he joined from Lazio in 2010. Italian job: Serie A champions Juventus have revived their interest in Man City left-back Aleksander Kolorov . Besiktas are hopeful of persuading Gary Medel to leave Cardiff for Turkey. The Chile midfielder, who cost £11million from Sevilla last summer, has an escape clause which was triggered once Cardiff were relegated. However, he also has admirers in the Premier League, as do team-mates Steven Caulker and Fraizer Campbell. Both are expected to leave over the coming weeks. Stoke are among the clubs to have considered Campbell. Manager Mark Hughes is intent on bringing in another striker and has scouted Markus Berg at Panathinaikos and other targets in the Bundesliga despite being rebuffed by Ivica Olic at Wolfsburg and, so far, Mame Biram Diouf at Hannover. Turkish delight? Besiktas hope to persuade Cardiff's Gary Medel to join them in Turkey this summer . Former Blackburn Rovers midfielder Radosav Petrovic is weighing up a return to the Premier League. The 25-year-old has been playing for Genclerbirligi in Turkey but has tentative offers from four Premier League clubs, while newly-promoted Leicester City have also shown an interest. Petrovic, who played 19 times for Blackburn in 2011-12, has been capped 37 times by Serbia. Crystal Palace are interested in Bordeaux's 29-year-old Nicolas .

"Pablo Larrazabal has called on everyone involved in the Spanish Open to wear black for Thursday's first round as a mark of respect to the late Iain McGregor. Zimbabwean caddie McGregor died on Sunday after suffering a heart attack while working for Scotland's Alastair Forsyth in the final round of the Madeira Islands Open at Santo da Serra. Larrazabal was one of many players to criticise the decision to complete the tournament - which had already been reduced to 36 holes due to numerous weather delays - and is trying to organise his own tribute. In shock: Pablo Larrazabal wants Spanish Open participants to pay tribute to Iain McGregor . 'In honor of an awesome man and a great caddie I want to promote the black color for all caddies, players and fans on thursday... £RIPZimMac,' Larrazabal wrote on Twitter. Abu Dhabi Chamionship winner Larrazabal is one of four Spanish players to taste victory on the European Tour this season, with Miguel Angel Jimenez defending his Hong Kong Open title in December, Sergio Garcia winning in Qatar and Alejandro Canizares in Morocco. But the 2008 rookie of the year - who celebrates his 31st birthday on Thursday - has managed just one top-10 since his victory, albeit a rather remarkable one in Kuala Lumpur. Larrazabal hit the headlines in the second round of the Maybank Malaysian Open last month when he shot a remarkable 68 despite having to dive into a lake after being attacked by hornets. Swarmed: Pablo Larrazabal was attacked by hornets in Malaysia and had to jump in a lake to escape them . The incident happened on the fifth hole - Larrazabal's 14th hole of the day - and after drying off and receiving treatment, he went on to birdie the par five and make another on the seventh. A closing 67 eventually gave him a share of eighth place. Garcia is as short as 4/1 to win his second Spanish Open title after finishing third in the Players Championship on Sunday, but France's Raphael Jacquelin will not be giving up his title without a fight. Jacquelin, who won a record-equalling nine-hole play-off at El Saler last year, said: 'It's another course for us this year, but I'm really looking forward to defending my title. ""Last year was a great win for me. It was a long nine hole play-off, so it was obviously very tough mentally and physically, but it finished well for me, which made it a little easier to recover from it. 'When I won in Madrid in 2005 it changed course the following year too, so I've done it before. I'm happy to go to Girona though. I've not played the course much - only the year that Thomas Levet won (2009). 'It's a great venue and it is always nice to go as defending champion. You get a good draw and hopefully that will help me to continue the form I showed in Singapore. 'It was a nice way to finish in Singapore with a 66 and hopefully I will carry that on into the season in Europe. It was great to have that round before I defend my title in Spain.' High hopes: France's Raphael Jacquelin is looking forward to defending his Spanish Open title .","Pablo Larrazabal wants to remember Iain McGregor at Spanish Open .

"Miss McManus alleged Derek Mitchell later dug his nails into the hand of 44-year-old Miss McGuire (pictured) when they sat at a table while the DJ was ‘holding court’ and telling a story . Pop Idol winner Michelle McManus spotted radio DJ Suzie McGuire’s husband grabbing his wife’s arm and calling her a ‘slut' as she hosted an event at a luxury hotel in Scotland, a court heard yesterday. McManus said Derek Mitchell ‘looked angry’ when she and Miss McGuire, a presenter on Radio Station Clyde 1, were having photos taken with military personnel. The singer and TV presenter told Paisley Sheriff Court she was ‘quite taken aback’ when Mitchell allegedly told his wife she was embarrassing him and that she was ‘behaving like a slut’ at the event in exclusive Mar Hall in Bishopton, Renfrewshire. The star said she was ‘baffled’ when Miss McGuire – whose married name is Susan Mitchell – did not react. Miss McManus was giving evidence on the first day of Mitchell’s trial. Accountant Derek Mitchell, 35, denies a string of charges including various assaults and breaches of the peace between March 2009 and October 2013. He has lodged a special defence of self-defence for one of the charges. Miss McManus alleged Mitchell later dug his nails into 44-year-old Miss McGuire’s hand when they sat at a table while the DJ was ‘holding court’ and telling a story. Miss McManus told fiscal depute Amanda Gallagher that Miss McGuire was a work colleague she had met while filming the TV show Pop Idol. She said Miss McGuire worked for a radio station and the court also heard the two women worked at corporate events together. Miss Gallagher asked the witness if there were any occasions when she noticed anything ‘out of the ordinary’ with Miss McGuire. Miss McManus said she knew Miss McGuire both as a single person and in a relationship and added: ‘There was one particular night where I noticed behaviour that I wouldn’t say was normal.’ Pop Idol winner Michelle McManus spotted radio DJ Suzie McGuire’s husband grabbing his wife’s arm and calling her a ‘slut as she hosted an event at a luxury hotel in Scotland, a court heard yesterday . The singer said they had been at an event in Mar Hall which Miss McGuire had been booked to host but as she was late the singer was asked to step in. She said when Miss McGuire and Mitchell arrived they were ‘a little bit flustered for being late but they seemed fine’. The jury heard that after Miss McManus had performed at the event some of the military personnel there asked for pictures with the singer and Miss McGuire. She said: ‘Suzie and I obliged, we spent about ten minutes with these guys getting pictures taken, they wanted selfies and stuff like that. At that point I kind of stepped aside to make a phone call or send a text message myself. Miss McGuire had been booked to host the event but as she was late Michelle McManus was asked to step in . ‘I noticed Derek coming towards where we had been standing and he looked angry. ‘He grabbed Suzie by the arm and said, “You’re really embarrassing me”.’ Miss McManus claimed Mitchell also told his wife: ‘You’re behaving like a slut, but then again you are a slut.’ She told the court she was ‘quite taken aback’. Miss Gallagher asked: ‘What was Susan Mitchell’s reaction to what was said to her by Derek Mitchell?’ Miss McManus replied: ‘Nothing, there was no reaction, which was the most baffling thing for me.’ She also told the jury: ‘In my opinion it was almost like it was the norm.’ Miss Gallagher asked: ‘The lack of reaction was particularly striking to you?’ and the singer answered: ‘Yes.’ Miss McManus said that later she saw Mitchell and his wife sitting at a table, where the DJ was telling a story. The singer claimed at first she thought they were holding hands but ‘on closer inspection’ Mitchell was holding Miss McGuire’s hand. Asked to describe what Mitchell was doing, she said his hand was on top of Miss McGuire’s and his nails were in the grooves between her fingers and he was pushing down on her hand. She added: ‘Whatever he did to her hand stopped her from talking, she stopped the story.’ The trial before Sheriff Susan Sinclair continues.

"It was launched as an alternative the wallet, enabling iPhone 6 users to tap their phone to pay for items. But some Apple Pay users in the US have been double-charged for purchases. The Californian tech giant has admitted there is a problem with its mobile payment system, but says it only affects ‘a very small number’ of Apple Pay users and is working to refund all faulty transactions. Scroll down for video . Double trouble: Apple Pay was first announced on September 9th by Tim Cook and rolled out this week. But some users who are also customers of Bank of America have been charged twice for purchases made with their iPhone 6. Here, a user makes a purchase at the Disney Store in Glendale, California . Apple Pay launched this week. It stores Visa, MasterCard and American Express credit card information and works with the iPhone 6's touch ID fingerprint recognition system so users can touch their phone on a contactless reader to pay for goods. It supports credit and debit cards from the three major payment networks - American Express, MasterCard and Visa - issued by the top US banks. However, there has been an early glitch and it affects Apple Pay users who rely on Bank of America, CNN reported. Apple Pay (screenshots pictured above) stores Visa, MasterCard and American Express credit card information and works with the iPhone 6's touch ID fingerprint recognition system so users can touch their phone on a contactless reader to pay for goods. Stores such as McDonalds, Macy's and Walgreensare involved . Apple Pay is compatible with the iPhone 6, iPhone 6 Plus and the Apple Watch. The mobile system works by holding the phone up to a card reader and pressing a finger on the TouchID button. This confirms the person's identity, and the payment is simply made as if the user had presented and signed their card. All details are encrypted and the system stores payment information securely. If an iPhone is lost, users can suspend all payments via the Find my iPhone service. A number of these bank customers discovered their bank statement showed they have been making double payments for goods purchased with Apple Pay. These customers include CNN reporter Samuel Burke who got in touch with the bank, which blamed Apple’s system for the glitch. Mr Burke wrote: ‘I called up Bank of America and they assured me it was a problem on Apple Pay's end. ‘That seemed feasible, because all of the purchases I made without Apple Pay were only charged one time.’ But Apple’s customer service department passed him back to Bank of America, because the company doesn’t keep records of names linked to transactions. Upon launch, Apple Pay’s focus on security and privacy was a big selling point, but Mr Burke said the situation of being passed between the two corporations was ‘every consumer’s worst nightmare’. After talks, Bank of America agreed to refund his double payments. Around 1,000 people are thought to have been affected in total. Apple issued a statement saying: ‘We’re aware of a Bank of America issue impacting a very small number of Apple Pay users. ‘They’re working on a fix that will be available shortly and reversing any duplicate transactions.’ Apple Pay is designed to protect the user's personal information. It doesn't collect any transaction information that can be tied back to a user and payment transactions are between the user, the merchant and the user's bank. A number of Bank of America customers discovered their bank statement showed they have been making double payments for goods bought using Apple Pay. The bank's logo is pictured . The cards are stored in a passbook app (pictured left)  which is an area of the phone already used for boarding passes and tickets. Users can see their recent transactions in the app, and switch between cards easily. It was this feature that alerted some users that they had been charged twice for transactions . Apple doesn't collect its users' purchase history, so when they are shopping in a store or restaurant it doesn't know what they bought, where they bought it or how much they paid for it. Card numbers are not stored on the device, instead, a unique Device Account Number is created, encrypted and stored in the Secure Element of the device. The Device Account Number in the Secure Element is walled off from iOS and not backed up to iCloud. Users can make purchases in stores and within apps, with credit cards issued by many US banks , which make up 83 percent of the credit card purchase volume in the country. The mobile system works by holding phone up to a generic card reader and pressing a finger on the TouchID button. The NFC chip is fitted across the top of the phone. All details are encrypted and the system stores payment information securely. It uses the Passbook app and cards that are already on file with iTunes can be saved to it. Users can also take a picture of their own credit card and add it to the account. This is verified by the card's bank before being accepted. If an iPhone is lost, users can suspend all payments via the Find my iPhone service. This won't cancel the cards, either, because the card details themselves are not stored on that device. Apple said it is 'working hard' on bringing it to the UK, although a date has yet to be announced. Apple Pay is accepted at hundreds of shops in the US - but not yet in the UK . In addition to the 262 Apple retail stores in the US, availability from leading retailers at launch include: Aéropostale, American Eagle Outfitters, Babies'R'Us, BJ's Wholesale Club, Bloomingdale's, Champs Sports, Chevron and Texaco retail stores including ExtraMile, Disney Store, Duane Reade, Footaction, Foot Locker, House of Hoops by Foot Locker, Kids Foot Locker, Lady Foot Locker, Macy's, McDonald's, Nike, Office Depot, Panera Bread, Petco, RadioShack, RUN by Foot Locker, SIX:02, Sports Authority, SUBWAY, Toys'R'Us, Unleashed by Petco, Walgreens, Wegmans and Whole Foods Market.

"The Cincinnati Bengals and Cleveland Browns may have been playing for first place in the AFC North on Thursday evening, but for a few minutes between the first and second quarter of the game, that was the last thing on the mind of any players on the field of fans in the stands. That was when the Bengals presented a check for $1.3million to the Children's Hospital in Cincinnati for pediatric cancer treatment and research, money raised from the sale of Devon Still jerseys, the team's defensive tackle whose young daughter Leah was diagnosed with stage 4 Neuroblastoma in June. The team also honored Leah during this ceremony as well, and for the first time ever the young girl was actually able to attend a game - and see her father play. Scroll down for videos . Superstar: Leah Still (above) was honored by the Cincinnati Bengals as they donated $1.3 million to the Children's Hospital in Cincinnati for pediatric cancer treatment and research on Thursday . Big game: It also marked the first time Leah has ever been able to see her dad, Bengals defensive tackle Devon Still (above), play . Pre-gaming: Devon posted a photo on Instagram of him and Leah enjoying some tea before Thursday's game . Fans got in the spirit too, with some displaying Leah Strong patches on their jerseys and others painting it on their face. It has been a whirlwind few weeks for Leah, who hopped on a flight from Philadelphia to travel to Cincinnati for Thursday's game, as the young girl also became a bit of a music video star. Not knowing Leah was the daughter of Devon, she was one of the young children fighting cancer who was selected by Hoda Kotb to be featured in a fundraising effort she started that featured the children singing a mashup of Cyndi Lauper's True Colors and Sara Bareilles' Brave, called Truly Brave. Brave girl: Leah flew in from Philadelphia, where she is receiving treatment, for the game . Inspiration: the $1.3million that was donated was all raised from the sale of Devon Still jerseys . Fan support: Fans (right) also showed their support for Leah and her dad Devon 9right) To date, the video has been viewed over one million times. The Bengals (5-2-1) helped Still and his daughter by excusing him from offseason activities so he could spend time with her in Philadelphia. They kept him on the practice squad to start the season even though he was hurt so that he'd keep his medical coverage. Happy girl: Leah and Devon could be seen looking at one another throughout the game (above) Real leader: leah snapped a photo with the Bengals cheerleaders before the game . Big day: the young girl also wore her dad's jersey, but with a little bling . ‘It's going to be added motivation just knowing my daughter is watching me,’ Still said prior to Thursday night in an interview with WCPO. ‘I want her to be able to hear how the crowd cheers that loud whenever I make a tackle, so I'm going to go out there and do whatever I can to put a smile on her face.’ Sadly, thought not that it mattered to Leah at all, the Bengals did not come out on top, losing to the Browns 24 to 3.","Leah Still, who has stage 4 Neuroblastoma, was able to watch her dad Devon, a tackle for the Cincinatti Bengals, play for the first time Thursday .

"There aren't many places left on the planet that remained unchartered. But three Slovakian hikers claim to have found one of them. Photographer Robert Nemeti and his friends Istvan Gallai and Tibor Balint say they stumbled upon an 'invisible cave' while walking in the forest near to the village of Borka in Slovakia. Scroll down for video . Photographer Robert Nemeti and his friends Istvan Gallai and Tibor Balint stumbled upon an 'invisible cave' while walking in the forest near to the village of Borka in Slovakia . According to Mr Gallai, it was once attempted to be mapped, but efforts were abandoned because of its size . The cave, which is situated 300 metres up a mountain near to the Zadielska Tiesnava canyon, is currently unmapped and only known to a very few local people. According to the group, the cave is so well disguised in the forest that it is almost impossible to find the entrance, even to those who know of it or have been told about its location. They say the cave, called Marcilyuka by locals, was created by underwater rivers coming down the hillside hundreds of thousands of years ago. It was apparently named after a local man called Marci, who used to live in it. To ensure they would be able to find their way out, they used a long plastic line to keep them on track and mark the route they used to come into the underground tunnels . The cave is so well disguised in the forest that it is incredibly difficult to find the entrance . They say the cave, called Marcilyuka by locals, was created by underwater rivers . The cave was also used by others during the Second World War as a shelter and hideaway from  enemy soldiers. According to Mr Gallai, it was once attempted to be mapped, but efforts were abandoned because of its depth and size. Many of the tunnels and paths inside the cave were so narrow it was made almost impossible to navigate. The three men say their their journey into the cave took a little longer than one hour.

During the first 20 metres, they had to slide on their backs in order to squeeze through narrow gaps. After 50 metres, the cave opened up to a huge 'room' where they found hundreds of detailed dropstones – ancient rocks deposited by glaciers thousands of years ago. Parts of the ceiling of the cave were very low, but at others points it was so tall they were able to walk freely through the cave. The cave was created by underwater rivers coming down the hillside hundreds of thousands of years ago . Tibor Balint said, that 'the cave has some very narrow, very scary parts'. He added: 'Once we got through the difficult path, we got a fantastic view of the inner room. 'We must add that the place is pretty dangerous to visit.' The group said that they left the ancient dropstones in the cave and tried to avoid disturbing them because of the length of time they had taken to be created.","Group say the cave is unmapped and only known to a handful of locals .

"A serial bigamist posed as her seventh 'husband' in order to get prescription drugs to feed her addiction to sedatives and painkillers. After being refused drugs by a doctor in Ilchester, Somerset, Emily Horne, 33, dressed up as a man and told medics she was her husband, Craig Hadwin, serving in the Navy at RNAS Yeovilton, Somerset. She had 'married' him earlier this year in a bogus ceremony in Scotland before using his name to dupe doctors into giving her sleeping pills.

Prosecutor Gordon Richings said: 'She . said he was in the navy and based at nearby RNAS Yeovilton and the sick . bay was closed but the defendant attended the appointment herself . purporting to be Craig Hadwin. 'She was wearing trousers and a baggy . football shirt and had extremely short cropped hair but the doctor was . taken in and prescribed her two sleeping pills.' Yeovil Magistrates' Court was told . that Horne changed her name by deed poll to Max Accastes Quiberberon and . used various aliases including Accates Hadwin and Cassy Hadwin to feed . her addiction, according to the Daily Mirror. Horne, who worked as a glamour model and appeared on X-rated films, will be sentenced for two counts of fraud to obtain prescription drugs next month . She . contacted the NHS's out-of-hours service in May telling them she had . been the victim of an assault and was prescribed diazepam and codeine . phosphate.

Their relationship ended after a couple of months and she left him for his friend, Simon Thorpe - the man who had given her away at her wedding to Mr Cunningham. While Horne and Thorpe were engaged she married another two men, Chris Barrett, who she met on a bus, and James Matthews, who she met on a train where he worked as a conductor. It was at this time that Horne started working as a glamour model, appearing in X-rated films.

"Aaron Hernadez was photographed laughing and smiling today as his lawyer attempted to suppress major evidence in his murder trial. Hernadez's lawyers are trying to get evidence from the former football star's cell phone that shows he was in contact with the man he allegedly murdered, Odin Lloyd, in the days before he was shot in 2013, thrown out in court. Lloyd, a semi-professional football player from Boston, Massachusetts, had been dating the sister of Hernandez's fiancée at the time of his death. Scroll down for video . No laughing matter: Aaron Hernandez (above) was photographed laughing in court as his lawyers tried to suppress cell phone evidence being used in his murder trial . Not the first time: Hernandez also laughed and smirked when his trial date was being set back in June of this year . Hernandez, 24, did not address the court during the proceedings. The prosecution told the judge the defense had agreed to turn over the phone shortly after Hernandez was convicted, arguing against their attempts to suppress this crucial evidence in their case. The defense, however, now maintains the phone was turned over under a 'false claim of legal authority' and is seeking to have evidence from it thrown out. In prior court filings, they have said the warrant did not authorize the phone's seizure from Hernandez's attorneys or from their law office and that the seizure was illegal. Prosecutors have alleged that Hernandez and Lloyd exchanged text messages arranging a meeting on the night that Hernandez and two accomplices picked up Lloyd in Boston before driving him to North Attleborough and killing him. 'They were clearly in communication with each other, setting up a meeting, as it appeared,' Bomberg said at the hearing. Silent: Hernandez did not address the court or speak at all during the proceedings . victim: Hernandez has been charged with shooting Odin Lloyd (above) Hernandez declined to allow authorities to search the phone at the police department a few hours after Lloyd's body was found, but his attorneys said he would maintain its contents and turn it over if a warrant was produced, Assistant District Attorney Patrick Bomberg testified during the hearing in Bristol County Superior Court. Bomberg said he learned that Hernandez no longer had the phone and that he had given it to his lawyers only when the prosecutor called to inform them that search warrants were being executed at the former Patriot's home. The defense has said in court filings that authorities learned where the phone was after Hernandez told them during what they call an unlawful interrogation at his house. The hearing is to continue Wednesday. Hernandez also is charged in another case with the murder of two Boston men in 2012 after a brief encounter at a nightclub.

"Englishman is tied second in leaderboard after good start . American Russell Henley is setting the pace in Florida . Rory McIlroy struggled on the back end of the course . Lee Westwood reckoned it was 21 years since the last time he was asked to strike the opening drive in an event as prestigious as the Players Championship. ‘There were about eight people gathered around the first tee and I think I knew them all by their Christian name,’ he said. ‘There were no shadows creeping up over the tee as the sun came up, no phones going off, and no rattling of change in pockets. It was nice.’ Good start: Lee Westwood is tied second on the early leaderboard . Last week at Quail Hollow he played with Phil Mickelson and Justin Rose. This time, rather bizarrely given he is a former world No 1, he was in the sunrise slot usually the preserve of journeymen. But if that was a blow to the ego there were plenty of compensatory factors, with no wind and unblemished greens to add to his own aforementioned list. ‘It was like being a golfer with a handicap again, given it was probably worth a shot,’ he said. The 41-year-old Englishman, who returned to the winner’s circle at the Malaysian Open two weeks ago, took full advantage with a five-under-par 67 that left him tied second on the early leaderboard headed by American Russell Henley on seven under. Prize guy: Westwood ended his drought at the Malaysia Open a fortnight ago . Setting the pace: Russell Henley is the early leader in Florida . No European has won in America so far this season, so it was encouraging to see the opening salvo of Westwood (right) backed up by US Open champion Rose and Spaniards Gonzalo Fernandez-Castano and Sergio Garcia, who all returned 67s, while Graeme McDowell shot 69. This was a heartening start from Rose given his modest record here, with no top 20 finishes in 10 previous appearances. This time he adopted a more cautious approach from the tee and was delighted to see it pay off. Rose was in the same group as Rory McIlroy, and if ever an opening 70 could be considered disappointing this was it. McIlroy began at the 10th and by the time he reached the turn he had the ball on a veritable piece of string. So good were his approach shots he birdied the 18th, first and second holes with putts of a combined length of just six feet three inches. Poor finish: Rory McIlroy struggled at the back end of the course . Five under and cruising, the idea that he would go on to drop three shots over the next seven holes seemed preposterous, but it has been that sort of nearly-but-not-quite season for the Northern Irishman to date. ‘A pretty average and frustrating round, given the position I was in,’ he admitted. It was here last year that Garcia had his fall-out with Tiger Woods, admitting the pair were sworn enemies. Focused: Sergio Garcia refused to be drawn on his spat with Tiger Woods . Two weeks later he made his racist-tinged remark at Wentworth that almost cost him his lucrative equipment contract and caused a storm of protest. No Woods to worry about this year because of injury   — Tiger demolished him in the third round — and Garcia was quick to shoot down American attempts to revisit the incident. ‘It’s in the past so let’s leave it there and look forward to hopefully what’s coming over the next three days,’ he said.","Englishman is tied second in leaderboard after good start .

"Scroll down for video . The Ferguson police officer who was shot in the arm was released from the hospital as the search for the shooter continues, police say. The officer was shot during a routine patrol near the new Ferguson Community Center and away from the protests related to the death of Michael Brown. The body camera worn by the officer was off at the time, though officials do not know why. Officials say that the officer saw the suspect standing behind the community center and gave chase after he fled. The suspect turned and fired at the officer, striking him in the left arm. The New York Times reported that the suspect fled into the woods, but that an hour and a half search by Ferguson and other departments turned up empty. The reports revised earlier statements that there were two shooters and that the officer was responding to a burglary. St Louis County Police spokesperson Sgt Brian Schellman said that the officer was wearing a body camera that was turned off for an unknown reason at the time of the shooting. Ferguson police began wearing body cameras in August that had been donated by two security companies. The officer was treated for non-life threatening injuries and officials believe he will live after being released from the hospital. Another shooting, this of an off-duty St Louis Metropolitan Police officer, happened hours later, though there are no indications it is related to events in Ferguson. An earlier press conference by St Louis County Police Chief Jon Belmar said police are hunting for the suspect and he did not think the shooting was related to protests over Michael Brown’s death at the hands of white police officer Darren Brown. Shooting: Missouri State Highway Patrol troopers stand posted at the corner of Chambers Road and West Florissant Avenue on Saturday in Ferguson as police search for a suspect in the shooting of a police officer . Location: Police have set up a staging area  on West Florissant Road in Ferguson, Missouri, according to local news station KMOV . Crime scene: A police officer takes pictures outside the Ferguson Community Center at 1050 Smith Avenue on Saturday night after the shooting . Police line: St. Louis County Police Chief Jon Belmar, left, and Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson gather together over the search for the suspect  who shot an officer . Show of force: Officers line up with helmets on in front of a crowd which gathered in Ferguson Saturday night . The center is located  away from where the protesters had gathered and Belmar said he did not think the shooting was related to protests over Brown’s death. 'I don’t think it is,' he said. 'It didn’t happen within the proximity of the protest area. This is a fairly secluded area. I wouldn’t have any reason to think that it was linked in any way, shape or form. At the original press conference, Belmar said officers chased two suspects, and as he closed in on one of them, the second suspect pulled out a gun and fired at the officer, who was shot in one arm before returning fire. Officials have not released the officer’s name or said how long he had been on the police force. Mike O'Connell, communications director for the State Emergency Management Agency, said authorities were looking for the suspect. He said: 'A search is underway for the suspect in the shooting of the officer.' Search: Police officers from various forces have gathered in the area to deal with the aftermath of the shooting . Police from various different forces  responded to the scene  and set up a staging area on West Florissant Road, KMOV reported. Reports indicate that the suspect fled on foot into a neighborhood near West Florissant Avenue and Stein Street. Officers and police helicopters canvassed the area in an attempt to find the shooter. There were conflicting reports over the reason for the shooting which appears not to be linked to protests over the death of Michael Brown by a white police officer. NBC News reported an officer interrupted a burglary at a business on Saturday night and was shot in the arm once before the suspect ran off. Crowd: A small crowd of people have gathered near police close to the staging area . Scene: Police from various different forces along with helicopters have responded to the scene . Earlier on Saturday, an eyewitness told NBC News: 'Everybody was fine, they said, police stay back and then all of a sudden a black guy came pushing everybody, when I was right behind the chief.' Antonio French, an Alderman of the 21st ward in St. Louis tweeted: 'Police are being instructed to get in riot gear.' According to several eyewitness accounts on Twitter, Captain Ron Johnson of the Missouri Highway Patrol told protestors: 'I'm going to ask you to leave and I'm only asking you one time.' In a video posted on social media Johnson then told protesters that the officer was the only person who was shot. Meanwhile, a small, peaceful crowd of local residents gathered near the police staging area on West Florissant Road. Crowd: A police car drives past a small peaceful crowd of local residents as officers hunt for the suspect . Eyewitness: This unnamed eyewitness told NBC News everything was calm until 'a black guy came pushing everybody' Suspect: Chief Jackson said police are hunting for the suspect and he did not think the shooting was related to protests over Michael Brown’s death at the hands of white police officer Darren Brown . Vice News reports that a St Louis Metropolitan Police officer was injured when a black sedan crossed two lanes of traffic and fired into his personal vehicle on Interstate 70. An unknown number of shooters produced handguns and fired at the vehicle. The driver of the vehicle was injured by the shattered window. Officials say the officer was wearing the pants of his St Louis Metropolitan Police uniform, but not the shirt or jacket. The incident is being investigated and it is unclear whether it was a targeted attempt on the officer's life. The shootings came just days after Ferguson police chief Tom Jackson issued a video apology to Brown's parents following weeks of heavy criticism and calls for him to resign. In the video released on Thursday Jackson apologized to the parents for taking so long to remove the body of their son from the street. Sorry: Ferguson Police Chief Tom Jackson released this video apology on Thursday to the family of  Michael Brown and apologized for leaving the teenager's body in the street for so long . Dead: Police took more than four hours to remove Brown's body from the street where he was shot August 9 . Shot and killed: Michael Brown, left, was unarmed when he was shot dead by Police Officer Darren Wilson . 'I want to say this to the Brown family: No one who has not experienced the loss of a child can understand what you're feeling. I am truly sorry for the loss of your son,' Jackson said. But his apology was not well-received among some and led to reported protests hours after it was issued. The grieving parents of Michael Brown said they were unmoved by the apology made by the Ferguson police chief - over a month after their unarmed teenage son was shot dead by an officer. Michael Brown's mother, Lesley McSpadden, called for Chief Jackson to be fired and his father, Michael Brown Sr., said rather than an apology, he would like to see Officer Darren Wilson arrested. Michael Brown, an unarmed black teenager was fatally shot by Officer Darren Wilson on August 9, despite several eyewitness accounts which suggested he had his hands up in a 'don't shoot' position. His death sparked days of protests, some violent and many peaceful, in the predominately black neighborhood of Ferguson Missouri where racial tensions reached boiling point. March: Protesters march in front of the police department during a rally in Ferguson, Missouri, September 26, 2014 following Thursday's clashes between policemen and demonstrators in Ferguson .

Support: The U.S. Justice Department has asked the Ferguson, Missouri, Police Department to order its officers not to wear bracelets in support of the white policeman who shot to death an unarmed black teenager . During the protests, residents said officers were excessively aggressive towards them and unleashed National Guard troops, tear gas and military equipment. In the video apology, Jackson apologized for the heavy handed response from his officers towards the peaceful protesters. But earlier this week, police officers from the St. Louis County Department were spotted wearing ‘I am Darren Wilson’ bracelets whilst on duty. Residents from Ferguson complained about the black bracelets - which had stark white lettering on them with the words 'I am Darren Wilson' emblazoned across them - during a meeting with federal officials.","St. Louis County Police Chief Jon Belmar said he does not believe the shooting was connected with the two protests occurring at the same time .

"A man who recently penned a self-help book on how to lead a happy life has given away virtually everything he owned. Over the course of just a few hours on Saturday, Brian Bagnall from Chicago held a garage sale like no other. Mr Bangnall, 32, of Franklin Park, gave everything away for free to punters who stopped by as he prepares to move to a fully furnished home in Virginia. Nothing left but the clothes he's wearing: Brian Bagnall decide to give away all his worldly possessions for free. But don't worry, he's just written a book on how to be happy which he is hoping will become a best seller . Free-for-all: People sift through Brian Bagnall's home as he offered up his belongings for free to help spread happiness and the holiday spirit . Lining up: Brian Bagnall gave away everything in his home aside from a few personal items as he prepared for a move to a furnished home in Virginia. Brian Bagnall & Tiffany Brunelli: Brian says it was his girlfriends' idea to sell everything. The couple are moving to a full furnished house in Virginia. Tiffany was also editor on Brian's latest book . He know's what he's doing: Brian Bagnall just wrote the book on how to be happy which includes learning to live a simpler life with fewer possessions . Instead of selling his belongings, Mr Bagnall posted on Craigslist that he was giving things away. 'After seeing the many videos of people acting crazy on Black Friday, we wanted to encourage some human kindness,' the Craigslist ad read. 'We thought about selling it, but that just wouldn’t be in the holiday spirit.' Brian’s girlfriend Tiffany came up with the idea. 'Brian had written a book and I was actually the editor for it and just reading the book just really makes you think about what you have and how you can help other people and basically what you put out comes around six-fold,' she told CBS News. In exchange for the free stuff, potential purchasers had to stick to a few rules. Mr Bagnall asked that no one push, shove, run, yell or do any other mean acts during the giveaway. 'This isn’t Walmart,' the ad said. Roughly 200 people showed up on Saturday morning to clean out his three-bedroom home and within a few hours, the place was almost empty. 'People . were waiting all over the lawn and cars were lining up and down the . street,' Mr Bagnall said. 'There were 40 or 50 people on the front lawn . when it first opened.' Mr . Bagnall said the sale was part of his plan to live . the life he preaches, although some have suggested the entire sale was . merely a publicity stunt to generate some much-needed interest in his . new self-help book 'The Happiness Bible', which came out less than a . month ago. One big clearout: Instead of selling his belongings, Bagnall posted on Craigslist that he was giving away his things for free. After seeing the many videos of people acting crazy on Black Friday, we wanted to encourage some human kindness . People who saw an ad on Craigslist thought it was too good to be true: A house full of possessions, free for the taking. But it was true and about fifty people showed up Saturday morning and cleared the place out . Dash and grab: People made off with whatever they could lay their hands on. here a woman (left) takes away some chairs ans a bag. The minivan in the background is taking away Brian's mattress and some chairs too! A number of high-end items were ready for the taking including a Sealy Posturepedic Queen Mattress, a Flexsteel couch and loveseat Set, lamps, a desk, bookcases and even DVD players and garden furniture. It would appear that if his book doesn't sell, Mr Bagnall will truly be left with nothing after giving away everything from couches and love seats to tools and ladders. He said people were even taking shelves off the walls. A man identifying himself as Ramasomie, said, 'This is a great thing. A lot of people need stuff to start their life with and he’s doing a great job. We’re very thankful for that.' 'There were a lot of smiles today,' Mr Bagnall said at the end of the day. 'People need happiness more than ever right now and Black Friday shows it.' The author's mantra is to try and do little things each day to spread happiness, such as buying a coffee for the person in line behind them when they go out.","Instead of selling his belongings, Brian Bagnall posted on Craigslist that he was giving away his things for free .

"Formula One boss Bernie Ecclestone could face an investigation by the Serious Fraud Office after he admitted paying a banker £27million to stay silent over the tycoon's complex financial affairs. The billionaire admitted last week that he made the payment to Gerhard Gribkowsky, a banker at the centre of a huge fraud trial in Germany. Although the tycoon has not been charged with any offence, his admission placed him at the heart of the corruption case. Evidence: Bernie Ecclestone testifies  in a Munich courtroom last week in the trial against banker Gerhard Gribkowsky. The F1 boss admitted that he had paid the banker £27million . Fraud trial: Gerhard Gribkowsky, the former chairman of state-owned bank BaynerLB, enters the Munich courtroom at the start of proceedings . It also raised further questions about the business affairs of the flamboyant billionaire, which have always been shrouded in mystery. It has now emerged that the Serious Fraud Office is looking closely at the case in Germany to decide if 81-year-old Mr Ecclestone needs to be investigated. A spokesman for the SFO said today: 'The SFO is aware of the allegations against Mr Ecclestone and is liaising with the authorities in Germany to ascertain if there is a case in the UK to answer'. The Attorney General Dominic Grieve confirmed the involvement of the SFO to his Labour counterpart Emily Thornberry. The Financial Times said Ms Thornberry had earlier written to Mr Grieve saying the trial in Germany . 'raises questions relating to bribery, corruption and tax evasion that . need to be investigated further by British authorities'. Gribkowsky is charged with receiving corrupt payments, breaches of trust and tax evasion. The case centres around the 2005 sale . of F1 shares by Gribkowsky's former employer, the German bank BayernLB, . to the London-based private equity group Citicorp Venture Capital, CVC. Gribkowsky, who engineered the deal, . was charged with fraud after he was found to have £27million in an . Austrian bank account following the deal's completion. Expensive: Bernie Ecclestone and daughter Petra. The tycoon admitted last week that he only found out her wedding cost him more than £12m after the big day . Prosecutors claim this money was . given to him by Mr Ecclestone as a bribe for securing favourable terms . for the F1 boss. Mr Ecclestone denies this. As a result of the deal arranged by Gribkowsky, Mr Ecclestone was paid five per cent commission – or £27million. But the F1 boss told a packed Munich courtroom last week that a payment of £27million he subsequently made to Gribkowsky was because he was being blackmailed. Request: MP Emily Thornberry wrote to Attorney General Dominic Grieve to say the trial in Germany which featured Bernie Ecclestone raised questions which need to be investigated . Mr Ecclestone claimed that Gribkowsky was . threatening to make false accusations to the Inland Revenue about his . tax affairs which would cost him 'billions' even though he was innocent. Mr Ecclestone said he paid the banker the money not to do 'silly things'. He told the court: 'I really did not have any alternative. 'I was under the impression he might have given some information to the Revenue in England which I did not know much about. 'If he had done and the Revenue had investigated and been successful it would have been extremely expensive.' He added: 'My fear was he would do something. I thought I could keep him peaceful and quiet and not do silly things.' Following the sale of BayernLB's F1 stake to CVC, Mr Ecclestone was appointed chief executive of the equity group and was able to retain his controlling influence over F1. Mr Ecclestone said the £27million commission he received was for facilitating the deal and giving the bank assurances that F1 was in rude health. At the same trial last week Mr Ecclestone revealed his daughter Petra's wedding had cost an astonishing £12million. But he admitted he only found out how much it had cost after the big day because his ex-wife settled the bill and didn’t tell him. Mr Gribkowsky denies all charges against him. The case continues.",Labour MP sends letter to Attorney General saying case in Germany raised questions which need looking into .

"A new witness in the brutal beating of Australian school teacher Robert Scott in California has come forward, shedding light on what led to the punch that fractured the 26-year-old's skull, damaged his brain and left him in a coma. Mr Scott, who was a PE teacher at several Tamworth high schools in NSW before flying to Canada to work at the resort town of Banff, has racked up more than $1 million in medical bills and has been in a coma for the last two months following the attack. The Scott family's US lawyer, Benjamin Tryk, declined to disclose the identity of the witness. 'We will forward the details to the Fresno police first due to the pending investigation,' Mr Tryk said on Wednesday. Robert Scott (right) and girlfriend Amy Jarvis in the intensive care ward at a California hospital. Mr Scott has been in a coma for two months after an attack on a US street . The lawyer did say the witness spoke with Mr Scott shortly after the August 17 incident and before his condition deteriorated and he fell into a coma. Mr Scott was 'lucid and level-headed' and described to the witness how his alleged attacker, Gilbert Romero, an associate of the Fresno Bulldogs gang, punched him without provocation, Mr Tryk said. 'Robert said he did not throw a punch, did not attempt to throw a punch and did not pick a fight,' Mr Tryk said. 'He said he told Romero he didn't want any trouble and was struck anyway.' The punch knocked Mr Scott down, with his head smashing into the asphalt road. His alleged attacker, Gilbert Romero, said he struck the Australian in self-defence when questioned by police. The district attorney did not file the charges, citing potential self-defence and Mr Scott's intoxication . The incident happened when Mr Scott, who was visiting a friend in Fresno, a city 320km north of Los Angeles, was walking along a residential street at 9pm with another friend, Norwegian tourist Helena Sordal. Mr Scott had a blood-alcohol reading of 0.24. Police said Romero claimed Mr Scott had yelled at Romero's girlfriend and their one-year-old son, who were in a parked car. Romero said when he confronted Mr Scott, the Australian threw half a punch so Romero struck him in self-defence, police said. The Australian teacher is fighting for life in hospital and has racked up more than $1 million in medical bills after suffering a fractured skull during an attack. He is pictured here with his father Stephen Scott . Mr Tryk said the new witness reaffirmed that Mr Scott was not aggressive towards Romero. Mr Scott, a rower, surf-lifesaver and physical education teacher from the mid-north NSW seaside town of Pacific Palms, was flown last week by air ambulance to Sydney and remains on life support in Royal North Shore Hospital. Romero was arrested by police on August 26 for felony battery, but the district attorney did not file the charges, citing potential self-defence and Mr Scott's intoxication. Lieutenant Mark Salazar of the Fresno Police Department's murder-robbery unit said the case against Romero could be re-submitted to the DA by the end of the week. Mr Scott and his girlfriend Ms Jarvis before the brutal assault in Fresno, California . Ms Sordal, who stayed in Fresno for weeks after the incident but had since travelled to Mexico, was willing to speak with police further, Mr Tryk said. Talking about his son's condition on Thursday, Robert's Father said: ''The doctors don't know if he will recover. He is lucky to be alive.' 'They say he's young and could make some kind of a recovery and we're just staying positive and want our Rob back.'

"Everton's week started with two old stars being made ambassadors for the loyal service they had given the club. Appropriately, then, it ended with a current player showing why he will deserve similar recognition in years to come. If Everton chairman Bill Kenwright has a special place in his affections for Ian Snodin and Graham Stuart — those who were given ambassadorial roles — the same must be true of Leon Osman, who recorded his 400th appearance on Saturday. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Sportsmail's Big Match Stats: Everton 2-1 West Ham . Midfielder Leon Osman scored the winner for Everton on his 400th appearance for the club . Osman diverted the ball into the net from a cross by Samuel Eto'o in the 74th minute on Saturday . Everton midfielder Osman celebrates scoring the winner against West Ham .

UNUSED: Jaaskelainen (GK), O’Brien, Demel, Lletget . Goals: Zarate (55) Referee: Mark Clattenburg 8 . Attendance: 39,182 . Man-of-the-Match: Leon Osman . Osman, 33, is not someone who courts the limelight but he took centre stage when his late goal settled a tempestuous clash with West Ham United and allowed the momentum to continue to build in Everton’s campaign. Manager Roberto Martinez described it as Everton’s ‘most satisfying win’ so far. He was content. Sam Allardyce, however, was anything but and it had nothing to do with being held up from speaking to the press by the loquacious Spaniard. Allardyce was simmering over what he regarded as an offside goal from Romelu Lukaku and poor defending in the build-up to Osman’s winner meant West Ham had nothing to show for their efforts. Mauro Zarate’s 55th-minute strike was no consolation. ‘It is hugely disappointing,’ Allardyce grumbled. ‘We tried to get the second goal and one punt up the middle is a hugely disappointing way to concede. Everton had four shots on target but they didn’t create a lot else. We have lost because of that and referee’s decision.’ With Alex Song, Enner Valencia, Diafra Sakho and Stewart Downing all injured, West Ham were stripped of four key men who have contributed to the side’s impressive start. Starting for the first time this season, though, was Andy Carroll — a significantly leaner Carroll — and he made an immediate impact, playing a magnificent sweeping ball to set Morgan Amalfitano free to create the game’s first chance. That scare jolted Everton into life and they began to impose themselves, with James McCarthy and Osman central to everything they did. West Ham played with a back five but they were never entirely comfortable. Osman was involved in Everton’s opener as was Steven Naismith, who would later succumb to hamstring damage, and after they combined, Ross Barkley’s shot cannoned off Winston Reid into the path of Lukaku, who swept his shot beyond Adrian. Was he offside? ‘I have been to see the referee,’ said Allardyce. ‘I will keep what I said to myself.

West Ham were sharper out of the blocks in the second half and restored parity when Zarate exchanged passes with Amalfitano to unleash a shot that struck Phil Jagielka’s heel and looped over Tim Howard. The game continued to be spiky and James Tomkins was booked by Mark Clattenburg for a preposterous reaction to a shove from Kevin Mirallas, who was also booked. It was one of many excellent decisions, the best of which came in the 74th minute. A stricter referee would have halted play when James Collins upended Lukaku but Clattenburg allowed the move to continue and substitute Samuel Eto’o sped away to provide a cross for Osman, who gleefully finished. ‘Leon was outstanding,’ said Martinez. ‘His role was marshalling the back four, so he was the last player you expected to see at the end of the counter-attack was him. But that sums him up. He gets the winning goal in a fitting performance. ‘He’s an incredible ambassador for this club.’ Move that led to Romelu Lukaku's opening goal for Everton - click here for our brilliant match zone .

"A Texas jury convicted a 45-year-old mother dubbed the ‘black widow of Keller’ of murder Monday for shooting dead her husband in a plot to cash in on his insurance policy. Michele Williams was also found guilty of one count of evidence tampering, but the jury acquitted her of a second count of tampering that related to her husband's corpse. Williams, who prosecutors say tried to frame someone else for the 2011 killing of her husband Greg Williams in their home in an exclusive neighborhood in the Fort Worth suburb of Keller, faces up to life in prison. Guilty: Defendant Michele Williams, pictured in court Tuesday, has been convicted of murder in the shooting death of her husband in 2011 . Big decision: It took the jury panel seven hours to convict the 45-year-old, seen here in court Tuesday, of a murder charge and one count of evidence tempering . The penalty phase of the murder trial gets under way Tuesday and is expected to take the whole day. The jury panel deliberated for about seven hours before returning its verdict finding Williams guilty of murder and tampering with evidence in the form of the firearm used in the killing. Mrs Williams broke down in tears when Judge George Gallagher announced the guilty verdicts at around 6pm Monday, Star-Telegram reported. Prosecutors have said Williams wiped down the .45-caliber handgun that killed her husband and cleaned off his hands to make 40-year-old Greg Williams’ death look like a suicide. Lawyers for Williams said in closing arguments there was no murder and Greg Williams took his own life because he was depressed due to debt and the recent deaths of his best friend and grandmother. ‘They want you to believe she sneaked into the bedroom and shot him over money,’ defense attorney Cody Cofer said in his closing statement. ‘It doesn’t make sense.’ Prosecutor Sheila Wynn called Michele Williams a habitual liar who continually changed her version of events. ‘Who does this?’ Wynn said in comments to the jury. ‘Someone who is trying to blame everyone else, someone who is trying to get away with murder.’ Calling Williams ‘a cold-blooded killer,' prosecutor Jack Strickland accused her of trying to pull the wool on police, the public and the media. According to the prosecution, Williams was motivated by greed and stood to be the beneficiary of $800,000 from insurance money. Mrs Williams entered a guilty plea earlier this year, but she later decided to retract it and go on trial on charges of murder and evidence tempering. 'Black widow': Defendant Michele Williams pictured at her murder trial in the 396th Criminal District Court Tuesday in Fort Worth, Texas . Emotional: Michele Williams appears to wipe tears away during a presentation of photographs of her husband's body at the beginning of her trial . Evidence: Prosecutor Sheila Wynn uses photographs of the crime scene while questioning a police officer during Michele Williams' murder trial . The widow initially told police her husband was killed by a masked intruder that broke into their house in October 2011, but she then changed her story, claiming that she staged a home invasion to cover up Gregory Williams' suicide in order to spare their child's feelings. In their opening statement last Tuesday, prosecutors told the jury that Mrs Williams shot her husband in the head to get her hands on his life insurance. 'The motive was money. Tried-and-true, age-old money — greed,' assistant district attorney Jack Strickland said in court, according to CultureMap Dallas. Prosecutors stated that in the hours leading up to his violent death, Greg Williams fought with his wife over their finances and even slapped her in the face for spending a large amount of money that had been set aside as a down payment on a house. But Michele Williams’ defense team argued that Greg Williams' death was a suicide, and that the successful business owner was worth more alive than dead to his wife. William's defense team, including attorney Cody Cofer (left), argued that the woman had no reason to kill her husband . Attorney Clay Graham claimed that the victim was suffering from depression sparked by the loss of his grandmother and brother in law, and exacerbated by his persistent steroid use. The attorney told the court that when Michelle Williams found her husband dead from what he described as a self-inflicted gunshot wound, she 'panicked' and went with her first impulse to protect her 4-year-old daughter from psychological trauma by covering up her father's suicide. The court also heard last week from Michele Williams' adult son, Andrew O'Brien, who testified that his mother asked him to help her frame Greg Williams' ex-wife, Kathy, for his death, the station WFAA reported. Asked about his reaction to Michele Williams' unusual request, O'Brien, 26, said he was shocked but thought at the time that she was having a 'mental breakdown.' The twice-divorced Dallas-area woman dubbed in the media 'the black widow of Keller' was arrested in 2012 for the murder of Gregory Williams, who was found dead from a gunshot wound to the head in the couple's tony home. Initially, Mrs Williams claimed that an intruder broke in, hit her over the head with a wrench and then murdered her husband. Crocodile tears? With her nails freshly painted pink, Michele Williams, 44, tearfully talked about accepting a plea deal in connection to her husband's 2011 killing so that she could get out on parole sooner . But police found no sign of forced entry, so Michele Williams changed her story, alleging that her 40-year-old spouse took his own life, and that she covered up his suicide for the sake of their 4-year-old daughter. On a 911 call placed by Michele Williams October 13, 2011, the woman sounded hysterical and was sobbing so loudly that the emergency operator could hardly make out what she was saying. Happier times: Michele Williams pictured with her third husband, Gregory, on their wedding day - years before the 40-year-old man was found shot in the head . But in the course of a three-month investigation into the killing, police were able to untangle the wife’s web of lies. According to law enforcement, Mrs Williams sedated her husband and shot him from one foot away after turning up the volume on the TV in the affluent Dallas suburb of Keller. The couple’s child slept through the entire ordeal. The wife then allegedly struck herself with a wrench and made the 5,000-square-foot home seem like it was the site of a home invasion. Detectives noticed a number of details that did not add up: Michele Williams was fully dressed with her hair done when they came, even though she said she was sleeping; the gun used in the murder was found on the premises but had no fingerprints on it; and the $20,000 in cash the couple had in the house had not been stolen. In the days after the murder, those close to the newly minted widow were surprised by her conduct and demeanor, CultureMap Dallas reported.. The . very next day after the slaying, Michele went out for a big breakfast . at IHOP. She then took her children on a week-long vacation, where she . went to sports bars and out shopping for Halloween costumes. Williams . also wasted no time selling off her husband’s assets, including the . client list from his computer company and the Blueberries frozen yogurt . shop he had bought for her. Eight . months after Gregory's death, Michele started dating her older son's . friend Gene Wallis, a bodybuilder and fitness instructor 15 years her . junior. Together the . couple opened a Kettle Bell fitness studio in Bedford, which they have . been promoting online with Michele adopting the name Shelley. Crime scene: Police officers arrived at the Williamses' home in the affluent Dallas suburb of Keller after getting a 911 call from a hysterical-sounding Michele . Speaking to the Star-Telegram earlier this year, an emotional Michele Williams said that if she were to go on trial, her chances of being acquitted would have been about 50/50. 'It can go either way. Win big. Lose big,' she said. 'With a plea deal, I’m looking at a couple of years before I’m out for parole.' The 45-year-old mother pleaded guilty in October 2013 to tampering with evidence and deadly conduct. But after Williams declared in a jailhouse interview in February 2014 that she was innocent, a judge threw out the plea deal and set a trial date. The defendant now faces a life in prison if convicted. According to the prosecution, in the aftermath of the killing Williams tried to delay her sentencing by falsely claiming that she was pregnant with twins. She also allegedly told her boyfriend she needed to finish as many Bible study classes as possible to make herself look good during the trial. With her perfectly manicured nails freshly painted pink, a tearful Williams earlier this year described her marriage to Gregory – her third husband – as 'wonderful' and insisted that she still loves his 'so much.'

"At every Atletico Madrid game this season, Chelsea's scouts have monitored Diego Costa's every move. Where he goes, they go. From the moment his season began with two goals against Sevilla, the Spain striker has been on the wishlist of Jose Mourinho. Since then he has gone on to score 35 times for Atletico as they power their way towards the La Liga title and the Champions League final. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Diego Costa training with Courtois and Atletico team-mates . Top of the shopping list: Chelsea are desperate to sign Diego Costa from Atletico Madrid this summer . Predator: Costa coolly slotted home a penalty that helped finish off Chelsea in the Champions League . Costa quickly made his way up the list of potential recruits because Chelsea have monitored the progress of keeper Thibaut Courtois since he left for Atletico on loan. Now he is right at the very top of it. They hope that Costa, who is leaving the Vicente Calderon after the Champions League final on May 24, will lift the curse of the Chelsea striker. Since Roman Abramovich bought the club in 2003, they have been through every striker in every major league across Europe. Arguably only Didier Drogba, who struck the winning penalty against Bayern Munich in the 2012 Champions League final, is the only real success. Over the years Abramovich has thrown nearly £200million at the problem. Big man: At 6ft 3in Costa has no problem going toe-to-toe with the likes of John Terry . Shove off: Costa confronted Terry during the first leg at the Vicente Calderon . Adrian Mutu, Hernan Crespo, Mateja Kezman, Drogba, Salomon Kalou, Andriy Shevchenko, Claudio Pizarro, Nicolas Anelka, Franco Di Santo, Daniel Sturridge, Fernando Torres, Romelu Lukaku, Patrick Bamford, Lucas Piazon, Demba Ba and Samuel Eto’o are among the imports. Among that lot, Drogba is way out in front. In the history of the Premier League, only three Chelsea players have won the golden boot as the leading goalscorer. Jimmy Floyd-Hasselbaink scored 23 times in 2000-01, but the Dutch forward was before Abramovich’s time. Drogba won it twice (2007 and 2010) and Anelka held off Cristiano Ronaldo to win it in 2009, just four months after his £15m move from Bolton. It is Abramovich’s dream to bring in a forward that he can drool over when he makes those occasional appearances in his executive box on the halfway line at Stamford Bridge. Goodness knows, he has tried enough times. Next season Mourinho, who has complained throughout the season about the quality of his strikeforce, has promised him that Costa will be the answer. Although his accidentally-on-purpose criticism of his strikers with Canal+ was made public, he had been complaining about his forwards long before that was aired. It was in the coaches’ room at Norwich, minutes after Chelsea’s 3-1 victory at Carrow Road, when Mourinho complained bitterly to those present about their class. In games against Bayern Munich in the UEFA Super Cup and Swindon in the Capital One Cup at the County Ground, Torres was the only orthodox striker to score for the club. Torres, Ba and Eto’o, signed in an emergency on August 29 when Anzhi Makhachkala went into financial meltdown, had yet to get off the mark in the Premier League. Mourinho wanted to address it and Costa’s arrival, for a fee of £32m, is believed to be the answer. They certainly hope so. Costa has impressed Chelsea’s scouting department and number crunchers at the club are convinced he will be the answer next season. Not the player he once was: Fernando Torres has failed to justify his £50m transfer fee . Flops: Strikers Andriy Shevchenko (left) and Mateja Kezman (right) were failures at Chelsea . Moved on: Daniel Sturridge is another front man who failed to live up to expectations at Stamford Bridge . His development has been remarkable, returning from a successful loan spell at Rayo Vallecano in 2012 to get his career at Atletico underway. He is the first of a couple of arrivals that Mourinho is convinced will turn Chelsea into genuine challengers for the Barclays Premier League and Champions League next season. At 6ft 3in, Costa can look after himself in the heat of battle. This guy is not afraid to tread on a few toes. In the Calderon, in the first leg of the Champions League semi-final against Chelsea, Costa deliberately thrust his chest into John Terry during the opening exchanges. It was a mild incident, easily missed, but it showed that Costa is not afraid of the physical side of the game. Next season, when combat starts in the Premier League, those qualities will come in handy. Big shoes to fill: Didier Drogba is the only striker to have achieved true success in the Abramovich era . Get me a goalscorer! Jose Mourinho has lamented the quality of his strikeforce this season . He is not a technical player and it may take time for him to settle into Spain’s system at the World Cup. Costa’s debut for Vicente del Bosque’s side, against Italy in the Calderon in February, was uneventful. Some at Chelsea still needed convincing . But Chelsea are not the type of team to have possession for possession’s sake. Under Mourinho, they have a different way of playing. Next season the team will be set up around Costa, programmed to deliver the ball into the penalty area. From there, he is exceptional. He shows no fear, instantly grabbing the ball at Stamford Bridge in the Champions League semi-final second leg after substitute Eto’o had tripped him. From the penalty spot, Costa put Atletico into a 60th minute lead with a drilled effort into the top corner of Mark Schwarzer’s net. That finished off Chelsea, but even then he knew where he would be playing his football next season. This time, they hope to strike lucky.","Chelsea want to sign Costa from Atletico Madrid .

"A spill from her toilet has led to Isabela O'Sullivan getting $35,000 in compensation for her pain. The 61-year-old Dubliner was so frightened by a falling tile while she was sitting on the toilet that she fell forwards and hurt her right knee. Just a few weeks before the September 2011 accident, O'Sullivan's bathroom had been re-done after a fire. Dubliner Isabela O'Sullivan was so frightened by a falling tile while she was sitting on the toilet (not pictured) that she fell forwards and hurt her right knee. She said she was so badly injured she lay on the floor several minutes before  calling a friend for help. Since the accident, she claims to have needed regular visits to a doctor, eventually requiring physiotherapy. X-rays revealed a degenerative condition in her knee. The Independent reports that she sued contractor Neil Kelly, who was hired by the insurance company to do the re-tile. Kelly in turn contracted the job out to another tiler and thereby denied any liability for shoddy work. He also called O'Sullivan's claim fraudulent, and that she had pulled the tile from the wall when she found not enough was ordered. But forensic engineer Barry Tennyson sided with O'Sullivan, saying he found 'poor workmanship' and that an improper adhesive had been likely been applied. The judge also sided with O'Sullivan. Along with the $35,000, she was given another $4,000 to replace the tile work.","Isabela O'Sullivan was so frightened by a falling tile while she was sitting on the toilet that she fell forwards and hurt her right knee .

"Scientists have claimed that our best chance of finding alien life is not looking for living animal organisms but rather plant life. Two astrophysicists have said we should be looking at exoplanets for signatures of chlorophyll, which plants use to convert sunlight into energy. And they say this could be done by a future telescope planned by Nasa to study habitable exoplanets. Princeton University scientists have suggested looking for chlorophyll on exoplanets. They say if found this would be a strong indicator a planet has vegetation. This in turn would suggest it has plant life - and maybe animals as well. This could be performed by a future Nasa telescope called Atlast . Princeton University astrophysicists Dr Timothy Brandt and Dr David Spiegel made the suggestions in a paper called 'Prospects for detecting oxygen, water and chlorophyll on an exo-Earth.' They say that it might be possible to detect signatures of water, oxygen and chlorophyll on an alien planet. One hundred million worlds in our galaxy are able to host alien life, according to a 'conservative' prediction by Nasa. And the space agency claims that we will be able to find that life within the next 20 years, with a high chance it will be outside our solar system. During a public talk in July in Washington, the space agency outlined a roadmap to search for life in the universe using a number of current and future telescopes. 'Do we believe there is life beyond Earth?' said former astronaut and Nasa Administrator Charles Bolden during a talk earlier this month in Washington. 'I would venture to say that most of my colleagues here today say it is improbable that in the limitless vastness of the universe we humans stand alone.' The latter would be the most difficult of the three but, if found, would be a pretty clear indicator that a distant world has plant life. To find it they propose that a future telescope could have a capability to detect the unique reflection of light from chlorophyll. However they write: 'Photosynthetic extraterrestrial life may use a different family of pigment molecules than their terrestrial [counterparts], and the understanding that any claimed detection would be extremely controversial.' They add that while detecting chlorophyll would be an indicator - if not definitive proof of life - we should also first look for oxygen and water. 'Water is a very common molecule, and I think a mission to take spectra of exoplanets should certainly look for water,' said Dr Brandt, the lead study author, reports Space.com . 'Indeed, we have found water in a few gas giants more massive than Jupiter orbiting other stars.' Once these have been found, however, they say that chlorophyll should be searched for on the most promisingly habitable world. In addition it would only be detectable when an exoplanet had a lot of vegetation and cloud cover. One telescope that could be used to do this would be Nasa's proposed Advanced Technology Large-Aperture Space Telescope (Atlast). 'The goal of a future space telescope will be primarily to detect water and oxygen on a planet around a nearby star,' Dr Brandt said. 'The construction and launch of such a telescope will probably cost at least $10 billion [£6.2 billion] and won't happen for at least 20 years - a lot of technology development needs to happen first - but it could be the most exciting mission of my lifetime.' Last week astronomers detected water vapour in the atmosphere of a planet 124 light years from Earth. The planet, HAT-P-11 b (illustrated), is about the size of Neptune and is the smallest outside the solar system known to contain H2O molecules . This artist's rendition shows a possible design of a potential successor to the Hubble Space Telescope. Nasa is now investigating the viability of this conceptual mission, called the Advanced Telescope Large-Aperture Space Telescope (Atlast), which looks quite similar to 2018's James Webb Space Telescope (JWST)","Princeton University scientists suggest looking for chlorophyll on exoplanets .

"'I don't particularly like coming second to Lewis,' said Nico Rosberg after seeing his team-mate, and only rival for this year's Formula One title, seal pole position for Sunday's Spanish Grand Prix. It was the second such statement from Rosberg this season; the first coming after he lost his epic duel with Hamilton in Bahrain. Indeed, Hamilton replied: 'We already know,' before the Mercedes duo shared a rather uncomfortable laugh. For Rosberg however, and while he might not like being second-best to his team-mate (who does?) it's become a rather consistent feature of the 2014 season. VIDEO Scroll down to get on board with Hamilton for a lap of the Barcelona circuit . Job done: Lewis Hamilton celebrates the 35th pole of his Formula One career in Spain . Thumbs up: Hamilton greets the crowd as his Mercedes team-mate Nico Rosberg is left rather deflated . Hamilton now boasts a 4-1 record over Rosberg in qualifying this season, while in the races themselves – discounting Australia, where Hamilton retired through a technical fault – the Briton leads 3-0. I make that 7-1. Ominous stuff. Rosberg has spoken at length at the importance of halting Hamilton's momentum this weekend. \But a fourth victory in as many races for the British driver tomorrow would see him take charge of the championship for the first time this season. You get the feeling that Rosberg can't let that happen if he stands any chance of winning the title. But with Hamilton in this form – he even described his Mercedes as a 'nightmare' to drive on Saturday – it could be argued that you wouldn't give the German much hope. Advantage Hamilton: The Mercedes pair shake hands after securing yet another front-row lockout . Down in the dumps: Sebastian Vettel . It perhaps shows how far Sebastian Vettel has fallen that he was given a standing ovation on his way back to the paddock after breaking down yet again on Saturday. It wasn't all that long ago that the four-time world champion was a target of the boo-brigade; fans seemingly unhappy with his treatment of Mark Webber in Malaysia and then his subsequent dominance. We almost forget that he won the final nine races of last season. But as he hopped on to the back of a scooter before returning to the Red Bull garage, the partisan Spanish crowd were on their feet. While Vettel has taken the bold step of changing his chassis for this weekend's race, his team-mate Daniel Ricciardo goes from strength-to-strength. Not only was he best of the rest, albeit a second down on the Mercedes pair, he was over four tenths quicker than Vettel in Q2 before the German's car packed up. Is he out-performing the car? Perhaps. He is certainly out-performing Vettel. It makes you wonder how closely he would have run the German over the past four years? Off track: Reigning world champion Sebastian Vettel has endured a troubled start to his campaign . Pastor Maldonado was back in the wars on Saturday after embarrassingly binning his Lotus on his very first lap. Maldonado's latest faux pas comes after he spun while taking his eyes off the road making his adjustments to his steering wheel before crashing on his entrance to the pits last time out in China. It's difficult to know who to feel more sorry for? Maldonado for becoming something of a derisory figure amongst the paddock and the sport's fans. The cash-strapped Lotus team for footing the repair bill. Or his mechanics for having to put his car back together, again. Either way, it's stunning to think the Venezuelan actually won this race for Williams two years ago.  I think it's fair to say that, bar a minor miracle, it's unlikely he'll be presented in the winners' circle ever again. End of the road: Pastor Maldonado's Lotus is loaded on to a tow truck after his crash during qualifying . Max Chilton may have been quickest in the Marussia vs Caterham battle – the Briton qualifying a rather credible 18th – his time would only have been good enough for fourth on the GP2 grid. Indeed Marcus Ericsson's lap-time in FP2 would have seen him qualify plum last in Formula One's feeder series. Hamilton's pole time was almost five seconds slower than Rosberg's pole position of one year ago. All in all, hardly a glowing advertisement for motor racing's wealthiest series. Hamilton's pole was the 35th of his career, and first at the Spanish Grand Prix. Aside from Brazil, it remains the only venue where he hasn't tasted victory in his eight-year career. But the odds favour him to break his duck tomorrow. Eleven of the last 13 pole sitters have gone on to win, while Fernando Alonso was the first driver to qualify outside the top three and win the race when he was victorious in last year's grand prix.

"Tube drivers could go on strike after a colleague was sacked for allegedly drinking alcohol on the job. Members of the Rail, Maritime and Transport (RMT) union on the Northern Line will vote in the coming weeks on a campaign of industrial action over the dismissal. Union leaders said today Transport for London was guilty of 'fitting up' the driver as part of a wider culture of 'harassment' of their staff. Battle: Tube drivers will be asked if they want to strike after Transport for London sacked a worker for allegedly drinking on the job . General secretary Mick Cash said: 'RMT has been pointing out for some time now that a new culture of harassment and misuse of procedures is rife on London Underground at the moment and the union will not stand back while individuals are fitted up and picked off, as has happened in this particular case on the Northern Line.' Tube bosses said in order to keep passengers safe it must have a zero-tolerance policy on alcohol at work, and accused union leaders of trying to strike before the driver's disciplinary case had been heard. ANger: RMT leader Mick Cash, Bob Crow's successor, says Tube bosses have 'fitted up' his member . Nigel Holness of London Underground said: 'To ensure the safety of our customers, we operate a zero-tolerance policy towards alcohol at work. Anyone found to be in breach of this policy faces a disciplinary process and possible dismissal. 'The RMT leadership has decided to ballot its members before the disciplinary process has been concluded and before any employment tribunal'. It is not the first time unions bosses have threatened to strike over alcohol. Ten years ago the RMT again wanted industrial action after five Tube workers were sacked following the discovery of more than 100 cans of alcohol in a mess room. Tube company Metronet said the dismissals of the track maintenance staff related to its 'zero tolerance policy on alcohol'. A total of 15 staff were suspended after an assortment of 11 full and empty cans of beer and cider, plus an empty bottle of brandy, were discovered at Farringdon station. But the RMT said that there was 'not a shred of evidence' linking the sacked workers to the booze, although the sacked men eventually lost their employment tribunals for unfair dismissal. In March London Underground driver has been arrested after he allegedly downed a bottle of vodka before starting his shift. The 50-year-old man is believed to have got drunk after getting into a row with his girlfriend on Saturday, it was reported. He then allegedly took the controls of a northbound Jubilee Line train and carried on driving when he was meant to take a break . It is claimed he was meant to stop at Wembley Park in north-west London, but he did not get out of the train until several stations later. At that point a colleague smelled alcohol on his breath and the police were called. The driver was arrested after failing to provide a breath sample and suspended from duty.","RMT  accuses Tube bosses of 'fitting up' the sacked Northern Line driver .

"Australia has chosen a state-of-the-art Dutch vessel to help map the Indian Ocean floor as the search for missing flight MH370 heads deeper under water. Netherlands-based Fugro Survey will assist a Chinese military vessel in surveying the ocean bed as part of the next stage of the quest for the Malaysia Airlines plane which vanished three months ago. The MV Fugro Equator, which is equipped with a deep water multi-beam echo sounder system, will work with Chinese PLA-Navy ship Zhu Kezhen to complete the mapping ahead of the underwater search by an as-yet undetermined contractor. The MV Fugro Equator will make its way to Australia to work with the Chinese PLA-Navy ship Zhu Kezhena in mapping the Indian Ocean floor for the next phase of the MH370 search . The Australian Transport Safety Bureau is now planning to comb a 60,000 square-kilometre (24,000 square-mile) search zone based on the plane's last satellite communication. The Joint Agency Coordination Centre (JACC) stated that the survey would provide crucial information to help plan the deep water search for MH370 which is scheduled to begin in August. ‘The bathymetric (ocean floor) survey will provide a map of the underwater search zone, charting the contours, depths and composition of the seafloor in water depths up to 6,000 metres,’ the JACC said. Fugro said in a statement that it expected its vessel to start mapping in mid-June which was expected to take about three months. Scroll down for video . Australia has set aside $90 million to find MH370 - expected to be the most the country has spent in aviation history . Meanwhile, the Malaysian government has revealed it has spent just a fraction of what Australia has paid in the search for missing flight MH370, as officials from both countries prepare to meet to discuss the next phase of the mission. But Federal  Treasurer Joe Hockey said Australia will pay its fair share in the search for the missing Malaysia Airlines plane. 'It is understood that the plane went down in waters that are our responsibility, and there is a cost to having responsibility and we don't shirk that,' he told reporters on Tuesday morning. 'We accept responsibility and will pay for it. We're not a country that begs others for money to do our job.' Officials from Malaysia are expected in Canberra today for talks, including discussions around funding for the operation. The Australian government has set aside almost $90 million for the search - expected to be the most expensive in aviation history - but it's possible that figure could increase. The Federal Government put the $90 million price tag on the search for the first time when it handed down the budget in May. The budget papers stated the actual cost will depend on a multiple factors, including the outcome of procurement processes for specialist services, the length of the search, and the extent of contributions from other countries. The head of the joint task force charged with finding MH370, Angus Houston, said on Tuesday discussions around the next phase of the search would include negotiations with Malaysia over the cost of the search. Malaysia has spent $9.3 million on the search so far and Malaysia's Deputy Defence Minister Abdul Rahim Bakri said costs of the next phase will be shared . 'The government has allocated $89.9 million. I think about $25 million of that is to go the defence force for the visual search they conducted,' former defence force chief Air Chief Marshal Houston told the ABC. 'There's another $60 million that's been allocated for the underwater search.' 'That money has been allocated but we're still to crunch, or still to negotiate the burden-sharing with for example Malaysia.' A Joint Agency Coordination Centre spokesperson said via a statement that a full accounting of Australia's search costs to date is 'not available at this stage'. 'However, for transparency the full costs across Australian Government agencies will be compiled at a later date,' the statement said. 'Malaysian, Chinese and Australian officials, including Air Chief Marshal Houston, will meet in Canberra this afternoon to discuss the ongoing search for missing flight MH370 and cost sharing arrangements. 'Currently, each country bears its own costs.' Malaysia's Deputy Defence Minister Abdul Rahim Bakri, pictured left, has said search costs will be shared 50-50 between Malaysia and Australia, while Malaysia's Transport Minister Hishammuddin Hussein, pictured right, confirmed his government had spent about $9.3 million in the search . But a senior Malaysian government official has already said Australia was expected to share the cost of the next phase, adding there were no figures yet for how much would have to be spent. 'Costs will be shared 50-50 between Malaysia and Australia,' Malaysia's Deputy Defence Minister Abdul Rahim Bakri said. The comments came as Malaysia's Transport Minister Hishammuddin Hussein confirmed his government had spent 27.6 million ringgit ($A9.30 million) in fuel and food for equipment and personnel in the search. 'The cost that we had to bear is relatively small compared to the other assets given by other countries used in the search,' Mr Hishammuddin said. 'I am proud that many of our friends have come forward to help in the search, and they bear their own expenses and have not made any claims from us.' More than three months have passed since the Malaysia Airlines Boeing 777 disappeared en route from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing with 239 people aboard - including six Australians. The Boeing 777 is believed to have crashed in the southern Indian Ocean, but an extensive search has turned up no sign of wreckage. The Australia Transport Safety Board last week issued a tender to continue the deep-water search for the ill-fated flight.","Fugro Survey and a Chinese military vessel will survey the ocean bed .

"A pensioner has been convicted of ill-treatment of animals for keeping dozens of emaciated and paralysed pets  in a home filled inches thick with their own faeces. Ann Wynd, 75, was convicted of ill-treating dozens of animals after SSPCA officers found dogs in cages crusted with inches-thick filth. Several animals had to be put down as a result of the discovery. Inspectors initially thought one dog was dead, another was 'almost paraplegic' and a horse was found to be clinically emaciated. Animal faeces were also found on the kitchen floor and walls, and appeared to have been there for months. Pictured are some of the dogs inside the filthy cages discovered by inspectors at Wynd's Falkirk home . An ill-treated dog pictured by inspectors at Wynd's home. Several animals had to be put down by authorities . A dog peers out from the cage it was kept in on the property. Many of the cages were stacked on top of one another and did not prevent urine and faeces trickling down onto animals below . The pensioner, who had denied cruelty, was convicted of 29 charges of causing unnecessary suffering to animals including 19 dogs, two donkeys, a sheep, three Shetland ponies and a Welsh cob horse. Falkirk Sheriff Court heard she kept a menagerie of animals, including dogs, sheep, donkeys, horses and goats, in appalling conditions at her run-down smallholding farm at Standburn, near Falkirk. At an earlier hearing Sheriff Derek O'Carroll banned her from keeping animals for three years - except for four dogs and four sheep. Today, after being told that Wynd had made 'improvements' to the area where she kept sheep, he allowed her to be given another four animals which had been seized by the SSPCA. He placed her under social work supervision for three years, under the terms of a community payback order, and added a further condition requiring her to let qualified vets inspect her animals and her property. Sheriff O'Carroll said that Wynd was still not suitable to be given back eight Shetland ponies, but he told her he would review his banning order on December 22. A four-day trial earlier this year was told that the offences came to light when Wynd's husband died suddenly in November 2012. Police went to her farm to deal with the death, and called in the SSPCA because of the conditions they found. Two donkeys found covered in filth at the farm. There were 26 animals found during the inspection . Ann Wynd, 75, has been placed on social work supervision and must allow qualified vets to inspect her animals and property. She is pictured outside Falkirk Sheriff Court . SSPCA Inspector Nicola Liddell, who went to the premises at once, told Wynd's trial: 'I was immediately shocked as to what I was seeing. We had concerns for Mrs Wynd because it was so unhygienic.' Inspector Liddell said she had realised something was wrong even before she got to the door. She said: 'There was a strong smell of ammonia and faeces and a strong doggy smell. 'It was overpowering and it caught the back of my throat as I entered the room. 'I was immediately shocked as to what I was seeing. The floor was wet, thick, and sticky with what turned out to be a mixture of mud and faeces.' There were eight cages in the room, some piled on top of each other, containing up to two dogs each. Some of them were stacked up too high and there was no proper floor on the top ones to prevent faeces and urine coming through to the ones below. All the cages were covered in filth - a mixture of chewed up bedding and the dogs' own faeces. Some of the dogs had barely enough room to turn round, let alone lie down flat. Mrs Liddell said the foul mixture was 'inches thick' on some of the cages and the dogs seemed 'distressed and frightened'. An emaciated dog, pictured, was found 'almost paraplegic' such was its level of deterioration . Mrs Liddell said conditions were similar in the kitchen where the smell 'just took your breath away'. She said: 'We had concerns for Mrs Wynd because it was so unhygienic. All the surfaces were piled up with food bowls, food utensils, old clothing, newspapers - it was piled high.' More dogs were found in 'filthy' dark condition in sheds outside, and a donkey was found which appeared 'nearly emaciated' and struggling to stand while another horse also appeared to be 'very thin'. Wynd, now of Maddiston, Falkirk, had denied the charges and defended herself at her trial. She claimed that the animal welfare officials had made mistakes. She said: 'They've got my animals mixed up. There are things that are not true.' But Inspector Liddell replied: ' It was very sad and almost distressing for myself to see that humans had chosen to live in a highly unsuitable environment for their own health - but that was their choice. 'These animals couldn't choose the condition they lived in.'","Ann Wynd kept dogs, ponies, a sheep and a horse in 'deplorable conditions'

"With Louis van Gaal embroiled in Holland’s preparations for the World Cup Finals, it may be a while before Manchester United supporters get to see their new manager at Old Trafford. Van Gaal will finally be confirmed as United’s new boss this week but will remain at Holland’s training base 60 miles outside of Amsterdam ahead of the weekend friendly with Ecuador. In advance of his unveiling by the deposed Barclays Premier League champions, however, Van Gaal would appear to have some encouragement for Ryan Giggs and indeed captain-elect Robin van Persie in terms of their own futures at Old Trafford. Big job: Louis van Gaal has plenty of work to do when he takes over at Manchester United . In an interview talking about his philosophies and principles, Van Gaal has revealed how he always likes to keep one member of the club’s coaching staff on his team and that he likes to appoints captains that he knows and likes. ‘When I go to a new club, I always want to keep one coach from the existing staff,’ said Van Gaal. ‘At my last club Bayern that person was Herman Kerland, who is still working under Pep Guardiola now.‘I wanted to know who was coming through the youth system — and he is the man who said to me: “Muller, Badstuber and Alaba. These are the players”. So I let them train with the first team, I observed them — and then I decided where they were going to play. ‘As for the captains, this is more based on characteristics, which is very important for me. I choose the captain, not the players. ‘I’m always choosing the captains of my team. I have to live with them and give them more responsibility. I have to admire him also because of his personality, his identity. My captains are very professional, but also very ambitious and honest. You can see these qualities in the captains I have chosen. Class of 92: Giggs sits on the bench at Southampton with assistants, Nicky Butt, Paul Scholes and Phil Neville . All smiles: Ryan Giggs could remain at the club next season . ‘Age is not important. When I moved to Barcelona, Guardiola was 27-years-old. Traditionally in Spain, the captains are the eldest players. I wanted to give him responsibility and transfer my philosophy. I have to click with my captains. ‘I told Pep “You have to be my captain.” He said: “No, no.” I told him: “I choose the captain and you understand the game how I understand the game.” That’s why I made him my captain. You can see what he is now.’ United have not confirmed Van Gaal as their new manager yet as they are continuing to talk to him about his coaching staff. Giggs, recently serving as the club’s interim manager, is likely to be offered a role but it remains to be seen if he will stay. Van Gaal will speak at the Dutch training camp this afternoon but journalists from UK newspapers have been told they cannot attend. He has admitted, though, that he missed the day-to-day contact with players during his second stint with Holland and it is clear he will attempt to bring attacking football back to Old Trafford next season. Watching on: Van Gaal takes the Holland team for a training session in Hoenderloo . ‘I think it’s my philosophy that makes me successful because it binds players with my training and in my career I have had a lot of players who are fascinated by that philosophy,’ he said. ‘They find it nice to take part in it because it’s attacking, technical and tactical. They can show their qualities more than ever. ‘The characteristics come back to my point on vision. You have to play as a team and not as individuals. That’s why I’m always going back to the vision, then the team, and then which players fit in my system, a 4-3-3, because I’m always playing that. ‘If a young player can do it, then I select him. If it’s an older player, it doesn’t bother me; it’s not the most important factor. Age is not important. ‘I miss the club work every day. I said once in a press conference that I don’t like that part and the Netherlands were...well, it was not good for me to say it. ‘But I said it because of this. I used to be a physical education teacher because I loved communicating with young people. Now don’t always have that. I have to select, watch, observe and I only have contact with my players about eight times a year. That is what I don’t like.’","Van Gaal likes to retain one member of staff at each club he joins .

"A former North Carolina corrections officer and bodybuilder who planned to fly to Syria to join ISIS pleaded guilty to terrorism charges on Thursday. Donald Ray Morgan, 44, had been charged with attempting to provide material support to a designated foreign terrorist organization and illegally possessing a firearm as a felon. According to NBC, Morgan had originally been held by police after being arrested on the weapons charge at JFK airport. American jihadi: Don Morgan, 44, told NBC that it was his goal to go over to Syria to work in food or aid convoys or 'directly' support ISIS . Investigators had been following his social media posts, and at a Brooklyn hearing, an FBI agent testified that Morgan had vowed support to ISIS online. 'Mujahid pledging allegiance to Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi and Islamic State commanding good and forbidding evil,' read a tweet from June 29 under the name Abu Omar al Amreeki. He was then extradited to face trial in North Carolina for both the terrorism and weapons charges. Morgan was born to a Catholic family and originally had dreams of being in the US Special Forces and went to bootcamp around the time of Desert Storm. He failed out of training and fell back on a career in law enforcement, becoming a sheriff's deputy and a corrections officer. That job he lost after a year and a half, Morgan began drinking heavily and partying. Convert: Friends said that Morgan (left), who converted to Islam in 2008, began to become more and more involved with the religion until it was his entire life by 2012 . Community: Morgan founded an Islamic community center in the US, but as his plans to enter Syria became more concrete, he began selling off possessions . He got into several fights, before going to prison for two years for firing a gun into a crowded restaurant. Morgan briefly turned his life around through interest in bodybuilding, marrying fellow bodybuilder Tangela Horne in 1999 and having a son with her in 2001. However in 2008, a year after he and Tangela divorced, Morgan converted to Islam, and in 2012 friends began to notice that the religion was becoming all-encompassing. Morgan stopped going to the gym, grew his beard, shaved his head, opened an Islamic Center near to where he lived in Salisbury and began tweeting extremists views. Bryan Beaver, who had known Morgan for 15 years, said: 'His Facebook posts were a bit extreme at times. Derogatory statements toward Israel, some statements about infidels.' In his NBC interview. Morgan admits that his views could be viewed as radical by Westerners, but said that he considers himself to be just a 'practicing Muslim'. He added that he was attracted to ISIS because he admired their devotion, and that fact that they put the worship of Islam above everything else. In January this year he went to Lebanon to visit his second wife, and spent months trying to move across the border into Syria 'to join the most beautiful brothers on earth.' He sold his belongings in the US in order to enter Syria through Turkey, but the government there stopped him in the airport in Istanbul. 'I purchased the ticket with the intent of entering to Syria, either joining up with medical and food aid convoys or directly with Islamic State,' he told NBC.

"Britain's fabled Desert Rats fighting force have had their tanks scrapped in the latest defence cuts. Under a shake-up announced by Defence Secretary Philip Hammond for the British Army over the next decade, the 7th Armoured Brigade is to be redesignated as an infantry brigade and their heavy armoured vehicles, including Challenger 2 tanks, will be parked up. A military source said: ‘It is a disgrace. This is the most famous tank brigade in the world and they are losing their tanks.’ The British 7th Armoured Brigade - nicknamed the Desert Rats - is to become an infantry brigade and its Challenger 2 tanks - pictured moving through the southern Iraqi city of Basra - will be put out of action . The 7th Armoured Division was formed in 1938 to protect the Suez Canal, and went on to fight in some of the war’s bloodiest battles. Nicknamed the Desert Rats, they were deployed to North Africa where, under General Montgomery, they won the battles of El Alamein to help change the course of the war. More recently they served on the battlefields of Iraq. The 7th Armoured Brigade will be rebranded the 7th Infantry Brigade – although it will keep the renowned nickname and badge featuring a jerboa, a desert rodent – and it will be dedicated to longer-term engagements such as peacekeeping operations, training foreign troops or helping control civil disturbances. Rodney Scott, chairman of the Desert . Rats Association, said: ‘It is sad because people think of the 7th . Armoured Brigade as “tankies” because the films show them charging into . battle across the desert. Cutbacks: Philip Hammond announced the change as part of a shake-up of the British Army over the next 10 years . ‘But it was much more than that. There were troops from the Army, Navy and Air Force. But they all had the emblem on their sleeve and that makes you feel proud. ‘The brigade has been adaptable through the years and that has enabled it to remain on top.’ The success of the Desert Rats in North Africa during the Second World War led Winston Churchill to declare: ‘Before Alamein we never had a victory. After Alamein we never had a defeat.’ The Desert Rats went on to fight in some of the war’s bloodiest battles: at Salerno in Italy, in Normandy and crossing the Rhine into Germany. They ended the war in the victory parade in Berlin – at the very heart of the Third Reich. The 7th Armoured Brigade was detached from the division during early 1942 and fought the Japanese in Burma before returning to battle in Italy. In 1958 the 7th Armoured Division was disbanded, though the smaller brigade remained in Germany, where it was reformed in 1981. The brigade is currently composed of a number of elements, including the 2nd Royal Tank Regiment and the Royal Scots Dragoon Guards. It has served in the 1991 Gulf War and in peacekeeping operations in Bosnia and Macedonia, and became the first British brigade into Kosovo. The revelation of cutbacks to the Desert Rats was hidden in the small print of Mr Hammond’s announcement on fresh roles and bases for the British Army over the next decade. Mr Hammond also said that 16,000 troops would be brought back from Germany by 2020 to save £240million a year, ending Britain’s presence on the Rhine where they have been stationed since 1945. An Army spokesman said: ‘7 Brigade, including their Desert Rat insignia, will remain in the Army’s order of battle as an adaptable force brigade. ‘As announced, we are reducing our heavy armour by 40 per cent and re-rolling units to face more modern threats. That is why the Desert Rats will in the future be an infantry brigade equipped with a range of protected mobility vehicles.’","The 7th Armoured Brigade is to be redesignated as an infantry brigade .

"A group of 11 boys have been rescued from a factory in India where they were working 12-hour shifts for just £1. The children, aged between 11 and 17 years old, were trafficked from rural areas in Bihar and Uttar Pradesh, in northern India, and taken to Delhi to work. They were forced to work 12-hour days stitching shoes and baking cakes and encouraged to work extra hours for an additional 40 Rupees (50p). 'It was like being in a prison': A team of child rights activists rescued 11 boys from a bakery and a shoe factory where they were working 12-hour shifts for a meagre £1 a day in West Delhi, India . 'Inhumane': The boys were allegedly forced to work 12-hour days stitching shoes and baking cakes and encouraged to work extra hours for an additional 40 Rupees (50p) 'Devastating to see': The children, aged between 11 and 17 years old, were trafficked from rural areas in Bihar and Uttar Pradesh, in northern India, and taken to Delhi to work . The rescue operation was conducted by Delhi Police after child rights organisation, Bachpan Bachao Andolan (Save the Childhood), reported the crime. During an hour-long raid, three boys were rescued from a bakery and the others were rescued from a shoe-making factory, in Nangloi, West Delhi where they were earning £1 a day - around half the minimum wage. The children were kept in small rooms where they worked, slept and had their meals. They had just a mat to sleep on at night. They were not fed properly, were never taken to the doctor or given medicine when they were sick and were not allowed to ever leave their rooms. Exploited: The rescue operation was conducted by Delhi Police after child rights organisation, Bachpan Bachao Andolan (Save the Childhood), reported the crime . Taken into care: The children were kept in small rooms where they worked, slept and had their meals . Founder of Bachpan Bachao Andolan, Kailash Satyarthi, said: 'It was devastating to see. 'These children, as young as 12, were working in such inhumane conditions. 'They were handling hazardous equipment, tired and exhausted and these rooms had no ventilation. 'Working for 10 to 12 hours in the dark was taking its toll on their health. All the boys were so frail.' One of the rescued boys, Deepak, 16, was from Samastipur, in Bihar. He said: 'I ran away from my home with a friend two years ago to try and find work in Delhi. I then met a man who offered me a job at a shoe factory for 5,000 Rupees (£50) a month. 'I happily took the job as I could then send money home and support my father, a rickshaw puller, to pay for my mother’s medical treatment. Rescued: The children are being cared for at Bachpan Bachao Andolan's boys home and rehabilitation centre . 'I even worked extra to earn an additional 2,000 Rupees (£20). 'But the owner never paid us and we were only given food twice a day and were confined to our rooms. 'It was like being in a prison. I wanted to leave many a time but we were not allowed.' Although Deepak had voluntarily left home, many of the other children had allegedly been sent by their parents to work in the city to support them financially. Desperate poverty in rural parts of India force parents to send their children out to work but child labour in India is illegal. Police have now arrested the bakery owner while the employer at the shoe factory is on the run. The children are now being cared for at Bachpan Bachao Andolan's boys home and rehabilitation centre. Kailash added: 'The Child Welfare Committee gave us permission to take care of the boys and try to reunite them with their parents. Here they’re able to act like children and play and learn like normal boys. 'They have three good meals a day and a bed to sleep in at night. We'll now make sure these boys go back to school and have a normal childhood.'","Boys forced to sleep on a mat, not fed properly and never taken to doctor .

"Roy Hodgson is set to unleash England’s young stars on Brazil 2014 by announcing an exciting World Cup squad tomorrow that is expected to include Everton’s Ross Barkley. With Southampton’s Adam Lallana, Liverpool’s Raheem Sterling and Jordan Henderson, and Arsenal’s Jack Wilshere and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain all set to make the cut as well, there will be a clutch of young and relatively inexperienced players in the World Cup squad for this summer. Barkley, 20, looks to be in, although Hodgson is leaving the biggest selection dilemma — whether to go for Southampton’s 18-year-old  prodigy, Luke Shaw, or 33-year-old Chelsea veteran Ashley Cole — until the last minute. Bright future: Everton's Ross Barkley appears to have earned himself a place in England's World Cup squad . Brazil bound? Jordan Henderson (left) and Luke Shaw (right) could both be on the plane to South America . Talent: Raheem Sterling, pictured here in action against Denmark, has shone for Liverpool this season . Shaw is more likely to get the nod and that would represent an even bolder statement of faith in the future. Everton’s . John Stones, who is 19, Cardiff’s  Steven Caulker (22) and Liverpool’s . Jon Flanagan (21) are being considered as stand-by players, while . 32-year-old Michael Carrick, of Manchester United, looks as though he . will be the major casualty, just failing to make the 23-man squad. The . rise this season of Liverpool and Southampton, two teams playing superb . attacking football with young English players integral to their . success, has been welcomed by  critics. Gary . Lineker, a former England captain and the World Cup Golden Boot winner . at Mexico in 1986, said: ‘Six months ago we thought, “Oh, we’re really . struggling”. But since then Sturridge has proved to be a top-class . scorer with a bit of confidence or arrogance. Catching the eye: Southampton's Adam Lallana has impressed in his three caps for England . Young gun: Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain (right) is hoping to prove his fitness before England depart for their Miami training camp . On the run: Jack Wilshere should be fit for selection after breaking his foot against Denmark in March . Hodgson's choice for first game vs Italy . 'You’ve got Lallana, who . can play in midfield or as one of two wide players, Sterling, who is a . tremendously exciting young talent, and  Barkley and Henderson. ‘A . lot of credit must go to Brendan Rodgers at Liverpool and Mauricio . Pochettino at Southampton. 'They have given the players belief and told . them how good they are, instead of telling them what is wrong with their . game. And it has had a really good effect, because they can all play.’ Former . England captain Alan Shearer believes Barkley has the ability to repeat . the impact his own strike partner — then just 18 — had at the 1998 . World Cup in France. ‘It . has echoes of Michael Owen in ’98 and the way he was put on to that . stage — he could produce something like Michael did in France,’ said . Shearer. One young player . likely to be disappointed is Tottenham defender Kyle Walker. England . medics are due to visit Spurs today to make a final assessment on his . pelvic injury and it is thought unlikely he will be picked. But United’s .

"A gun range owner says she wants to ban all followers of Islam from her business claiming the religion 'commands them to kill' her. In a rambling and bizarre blog post, range owner Jan Morgan wrote that she doesn't consider Islam to be a religion — and as such Muslims shouldn't be allowed protections under the U.S. Constitution. 'Why would I want to rent or sell a gun and hand ammunition to someone who aligns himself with a religion that commands him to kill me?' wrote Morgan, who claims she's been the target of threats by Muslims before. Scroll down for video . Arkansas business owner Jan Morgan says she wants her shooting range to be a 'Muslim-free zone' Morgan, who says she has been threatened before, wrote in a rambling blog post: 'Why would I want to rent or sell a gun and hand ammunition to someone who aligns himself with a religion that commands him to kill me?' A Muslim rights group has asked the U.S. Department of Justice to investigate the Arkansas shooting range owner. The Washington, DC,-based Council on American-Islamic Relations has asked Attorney General Eric Holder to investigate the Gun Cave Indoor Shooting Range in Hot Springs on the grounds of racial and religious discrimination. The group's attorney, Jenifer Wicks, says the move could 'inevitably result in a hostile environment for ordinary Muslims in Arkansas.' Morgan cited the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, and the Boston Marathon bombings and some of the reasons to mistrust Muslims. Morgan said some of her patrons were 'frightened' when two men with 'Allah Akbar ring tone and message alert tones' — the Arabic phrase meaning 'God is the greatest' — walked into her range recently. Morgan is the owner of the Gun Cave Indoor Shooting Range (pictured) in Hot Springs, Arkansas . 'They spoke very little English, one did not have proof of U.S. citizenship, yet they wanted to rent and shoot,' Morgan wrote. 'They were constantly glancing toward the cameras in the range, then looking at each other and speaking in their own language. 'Their behavior was so strange, it frightened my patrons. No one would enter the range to shoot while they were there. Some of my customers left. I lost business and the people who remained at my facility said they did so out of fear for my safety.' Morgan was unavailable for comment when sought by MailOnline on Thursday evening. In a phone call, an employee at Gun Cave Indoor Shooting Range said Morgan is considering changing her business into a private shooting club. 'As such, we can say who may or may not be a member,' the staffer said. 'We don't ask anybody what their religion is, we don't care. 'They come in here and act normal, we don't have a problem.' Bizarrely, Morgan seems to justify her Muslim-free idea on the advice of agents from the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. She claims two agents told her 'if we feel ANY reason for concern about selling someone a firearm, even sense that something is not right about an individual, or if we are concerned about that [person's] mental state, even if they pass a background check, we do not have to sell that person a gun. The Council on American-Islamic Relations has asked the U.S. Department of Justice to investigate Morgan (pictured) on ground of racial and religious discrimination . She added: 'I understand that not all Muslims are terrorists. I also believe there are as many Muslims who do not know what is in their Koran as there are Christians who do not know what is in their Bible. 'Since I have no way of discerning which Muslims will or will not kill in the name of their religion and the commands in their Koran, I choose to err on the side of caution for the safety of my patrons.' The Council on American-Islamic Relations sent a copy of its letter to Arkansas Gov. Mike Beebe, the Civil Rights Division of the U.S. Justice Department, the U.S. Attorney for the Western District of Arkansas and the ATF's regional office in Little Rock. Responding to the letter, she wrote in her Facebook page: 'I’ve been a target of Islamist threats for five years..fully expecting at any time one of them to follow through with the threat. I may go down for speaking the truth about Islam... … I may lose everything I have, (which isn't much) but they can't take my integrity... This is a mountain I’m willing to die on….'","Arkansas business owner Jan Morgan says she wants all Muslims to be barred from the Gun Cave Indoor Shooting in Hot Springs .

"Gareth Bale marked his return to the Real Madrid starting line-up by scoring after just nine minutes in a convincing 5-1 win over Rayo Vallecano that gave Carlo Ancelotti’s team their 13th straight victory. The Welshman, who also hit the crossbar in the second half, has seen Madrid win their last seven games as he recovered from a Gluteus injury and some supporters have made no secret of the desire to seem the team left unchanged but he came in for Isco on Saturday night at the Santiago Bernabeu and helped Real to yet another comfortable win. Cristiano Ronaldo played Toni Kroos in behind the Rayo Vallecano defence and the German midfielder crossed from the left for Bale to swoop at the back post and convert the centre for the opener. Real Madrid winger Gareth Bale celebrates after scoring the opening goal against Rayo Vallecano . Real Madrid: Navas 5, Nacho 6, Pepe 8, Ramos 7, Marcelo 7, Kroos 9, Modric 8, Bale 7, Rodriguez 6, Ronaldo 7, Benzema 7 . Goals: Bale 9, Ramos 40, Kroos 56, Benzema 59, Ronaldo 83 . Rayo Vallecano: Alvarez 6, Tito 6, Ze Castro 5, Ba 5, Insua 6, Fatau 6, Trashorras 6, Lica 6, Bueno 6, Kakuta 6, Baptistao 7 . Goal: Bueno 44 . Real Madrid doubled their lead just before the break when James Rodriguez's corner from the right dropped for Sergio Ramos, who hooked the ball in with his knee after Pepe failed to reach it. Real looked to be cruising at this point but Rodriguez blotted his copybook with a poor back pass that appeared to allow Rayo back into the game just before the half-time whistle. The Colombian had time on the ball but rolled it back to goalkeeper Keylor Navas and Leo Baptistao stole in and crossed for Alberto Bueno to bring Rayo back into the match. The Madrid-based minnows are famed for combining fine attacking football with kamikaze defending and so it had been in the first 45 minutes but at least they kept 17-goal Cristiano Ronaldo quiet. The Portuguese forward had showed off his Golden Shoe trophy at the start of the match but failed to add to his season’s tally in the first 45 minutes of the game. Rayo had looked bright going forward with former Chelsea winger Gael Kakuta, who was give his debut at Stamford Bridge by Ancelotti in 2009, seeing plenty of the ball.

Gareth Bale celebrates scoring the opening goal against Rayo Vallecano at Santiago Bernabeu . At the start of the second half Rayo looked to have equalised when Leo Baptistao had the ball in the back of the net only to see it chalked off for a marginal offside. Real went straight down the other end and made it 3-1 and the goal was the pick of the bunch. Ronaldo crossed from the right and Kroos passed the ball into the back of the net with the smoothest of finishes that curled just inside the post and beyond Cristian Alvarez’s dive. Real Madrid forward Cristiano Ronaldo holds off three defenders . Real Madrid's Cristiano Ronaldo shows his gold boot to supporters before Saturday's match . Within four minutes it was four and another very close offside call went against Rayo. Karim Benzema was the wrong side of the last Rayo defender when Roanldo crossed from the right; the linesman’s flag should have been raised but he was not up with play and Benzema celebrated his sixth league goal of the season. Rayo had only won once in 15 games in the Santiago Bernabeu and this was not going to be their night either. Bale’s perfectly weighted pass found Ronaldo and it might easily have been five. Bale then thundered a shot in from the edge of the area which Alvarez palmed on to his crossbar. All that was missing was a goal from Real’s top scorer Ronaldo and with five minutes left it came with a shot that squirmed under Alvarez’s body after Benzema had intelligently held the ball up while the Portuguese came back from an offside position. Rayo had lost this fixture 5-0 last season so they are getting closer to getting something from the fixture. Not much closer though. The consolation is that at the moment they are not the only team who cannot live with this Madrid side. Sergio Ramos scores the second goal for Real Madrid against Rayo Vallecano .

"A British mother has been deported from Dubai – and forced to leave her six-year-old daughter behind – for working without her estranged husband’s permission. Secondary school teacher Tess Lorrigan was in her classroom with a group of 13-year-old children when she was arrested by immigration officials and thrown into one of the Middle Eastern state’s notoriously tough prisons for two days. She had taken the job teaching media and film studies to support her adopted daughter Olianne after separating from her husband of eight years, expat company director Michael Lorrigan. Court Battle: Tess and her adopted daughter Olianne . Tess claims he lodged the complaint after becoming bitter over their tug-of-love battle for Olianne. In Dubai, it is an offence for a married woman to work without her husband’s permission. But Mr Lorrigan insists he became frustrated after Tess broke their access agreement and disappeared with their daughter while he was away on business. Tess then spent six months and £6,000 fighting for the right to remain in the oil-rich country, and for custody of Olianne, after the girl went to live with Michael. But Tess was deported back to the UK last month and now faces spending Christmas without her daughter. Tess, now living in the New Forest in Hampshire, said: ‘I feel lost. Olianne loves Christmas. Every other year we’ve come to the UK or my parents have come out. Olianne’s always had her family and her cousins with her. ‘She will have a very lonely Christmas this year. There have been moments when I have felt desperate. 'I don’t know how long it’s going to be before I see my daughter again and I don’t know what to do for the best.’ Estranged: Tess had taken the job in Dubai (pictured) to support her adopted daughter after separating from her husband . Tess moved out to Dubai 15 years ago and married Mr Lorrigan, now 59, the managing director of a training company, in 2001. The couple could not have children but travelled to Nepal to adopt Olianne in February 2008. However, their marriage broke down in 2009. Tess then began divorce proceedings through the UK courts, which have still not concluded. She found a teaching job in the neighbouring emirate of Sharjah, half an hour from Dubai – but was stunned when police arrested her in May as Michael had not formally approved she could work. She said: ‘It is a law but it is rarely enforced. I spent £6,000 trying to win the immigration case against me but in October I found out I had lost. ‘I could have tried to appeal but I didn’t have any extra money and I had been advised it wouldn’t have done any good.’ Speaking from Dubai, Mr Lorrigan said: ‘I came home from a business trip to find them gone. ‘We later had an access agreement that would have let me have Olianne three weekends a month, but she broke that.’","Teacher was at work when was arrested and thrown into notorious Middle Eastern prison .

"'Ointment': David Acres, 36, denied he was performing a sex act on himself . A man who exposed himself to a coach load of schoolgirls while driving along a motorway claimed he was applying ointment to his genitals, a court heard. David Acres, 36, denied he was performing a sex act on himself as he drove past the shocked pupils along the M6 motorway near Rugby, Warwickshire. Acres, 36, was seen with his hand moving 'furiously' on his genitals by the schoolgirls and their teacher, it was said. But he told Warwick Crown Court he was simply rubbing ointment on himself at the time. A statement from Acres' wife said he had had a problem with a sore genital area for some time but had not been to a doctor about it. Acres, of Irthlingborough, Northamptonshire, denied indecently exposing his genitals intending someone to see them and be caused alarm or distress in March 2011. But on the day of his trial at Warwick Crown Court he pleaded guilty to an alternative charge of outraging public decency by his actions. Denis Desmond, prosecuting, said: 'The Crown were not minded to pursue the allegation that he did it intending the children on the coach to see what he was doing.' However, the prosecution said they did not accept Acres' claim that he was not performing a sex act at the time as the teacher said he had been performing the act 'furiously'. Judge Alan Parker said: 'His case is that he was applying ointment while driving in his car on the M6 motorway. 'The risk assessment that follows needs to be based on either a finding that he was merely applying ointment to himself and gave no thought to the young girls on the coach seeing him, or that he was performing a sexual act; because if he was, it makes it more likely he will do the same in the future.' The case was adjourned for a 'trial of issue' at which the teacher, but not the girls, will be called to give evidence, and Acres was granted bail.

"An Australian woman, who hit back at a phone scammer claiming to be a Telstra employee, has shared her hilarious prank in an effort to warn others. Samantha Gear, from Devonport in Tasmania, explained that she was fed up with constantly receiving phone calls from scammers and decided to advise others about the money thieving calls. 'There is always either an unknown transaction on my credit card or my computer has been compromised. Which are all lies,' Ms Gear wrote in the caption of her six minute video. 'Every time I receive [a call], I play their little games too'. Scroll down for video . Fed up with receiving phone calls from scammers, Samantha Gear from Devonport in Tasmania recorded a conversation with a man claiming to be from Telstra and pranked him for revenge . The footage shows Ms Gear with her home phone in her hand from which a male's voice instructs her on how to fix her computer. 'Press down the window button and the letter R together at the same time. Press it and then release it. You might be getting a box on the computer screen,' the man says. Determined to make the scammer's job as difficult as possible, Ms Gear plays dumb. 'But, I'm using an iPad,' she tells her caller, to which a confused male's voice replies: 'But, how is this possible ma'am?' 'You said to go to my computer and I only have an iPad,' Ms Gear is heard saying. During the call, she frustrated the scammer by telling him she has an iPad instead of a computer and offers to pay him with her library card . After confirming with her that she has no computers at all, the scammer can be heard mumbling in a confused manner before finding a different 'problem' that Ms Gear requires urgent assistance with. 'Alright then what we are going to do now… we are going to send you a technician urgently and he will diagnose the problem of your internet as well as your iPad, alright?' the scammer says. 'So now for the technician charge, you need to pay a… payment of $3 alright?' He then requests that Ms Gear read out the digits printed on her 'plastic card' only to be told that she doesn't own a credit card. Using his last resort, the man threatens to disconnect both Ms Gear's internet and her phone connection until she finds a method of paying . Instead, Ms Gear offers to pay the fee in cheque form, with the coins in her pocket or even by using her library card.

Ex-pats living in the tiny haven of Monaco are free to get . honours, fund political parties and run businesses while escaping the . taxes that apply to other citizens . But many wealthy Britons in the tax enclave still hold on to many links to the UK. More than 500 directors of UK companies have registered addresses in Monaco and control over 1,300 firms, an investigation found. Restaurant and property tycoon, John De Stefano, 67, who runs 81 companies from the principality, is among them. And at least 11 people who live in Monaco as tax exiles, or benefit through family members, have been awarded honours. They include the billionaires Sir Philip Green and Jim McColl OBE. Six Monaco-based Tory donors have made political donations – despite government pledges to close a loophole enabling them to do so. They include Lord Laidlaw, 69, who gave £5million, and David Instance, 73, a Kent businessman, who provided a helicopter used by David Cameron. HMRC spokesman David Richardson said . last night: ‘The Government wants to make sure the rules in our tax . system are clear, but those on tax residence are currently complicated . and uncertain. Sir Philip Green and Tory donor Lord Laidlaw are among more than 2,000 Britons living in Monaco who are believed to be costing the UK economy £1billion a year . ‘They have built up over time, often based on decisions in the courts, so we are bringing in a residence test that will bring certainty to the minority of people whose tax residence status is not immediately clear.’ Monaco residents – who are not breaking any laws – often reject the term tax exile and say they are only there to enjoy the lifestyle and weather in the principality. They say they contribute to the British economy by creating jobs and paying corporate tax at source, and they pay 19.6 per cent VAT in Monaco. HMRC added that it routinely vets would-be honours recipients when the Cabinet Office sends the list to Government departments. Comedian Jimmy Carr was forced to apologise earlier this year after it was revealed he put his earnings into a Jersey-based tax avoidance scheme called K2, which reduced the income tax liability of participants to as little as one per cent. Both David Cameron and Chancellor George Osborne have branded aggressive tax avoidance, like the one used by Mr Carr, as ‘morally repugnant’. Mr Osborne pledged to clampdown on such schemes during the last budget.","They are free to get honours, fund political parties and run businesses while escaping taxes .

"Here's how Dwight Gayle scored Crystal Palace's opener at Craven Cottage -          CLICK HERE FOR MATCH ZONE . Felix Magath will look to youth to secure Fulham’s return to the Premier League next season after he was shocked to see his team abandon the fight for survival. ‘I saw Sunderland and Norwich playing at Craven Cottage,’ said Magath. ‘They had much more fight. I asked my team, “What's going on?'” and one player told me, “We cannot fight.” We never fought as a team against relegation.’ Magath was buoyed to witness 21-year-old Chris David rescue a draw at Craven Cottage with a superb strike from distance. It was Fulham’s last touch of the game and brought the curtain down on a 13-year spell in the Premier League. But the German manager said it pointed the way towards their return.

"Locked up: Tim Haries has been jailed for six months after being found guilty of defacing a portrait of the Queen at Westminster Abbey . A Fathers4Justice campaigner vowed to go on hunger strike today as he was sentenced to six months in prison for defacing a portrait of the Queen with paint in Westminster Abbey. Tim Haries, 42, who told jurors he vandalised the picture to highlight the 'social justice issue of our time', had denied a charge of causing criminal damage of more than £5,000 but was found guilty at London’s Southwark Crown Court last month. The father-of-two smuggled a can of purple spray paint into the Abbey on June 13 last year before writing the word 'help' on the painting, which is worth £160,000. Recorder of Westminster Judge Alistair McCreath told him: 'This was a deliberate and planned causing of damage to a valuable item of property on public display, carried out as a publicity exercise.' During chaotic scenes inside the court, Haries' supporters shouted 'shame on you' and 'disgusting' during the judge's remarks. At one point Judge McCreath threatened to clear the public gallery if the disturbance did not stop. The judge said the sentence must acknowledge Haries’ distress and unhappiness, but have regard to the case’s aggravating features, and to a degree deter others. Jurors heard how Haries shouted 'fathers for justice' as he scrawled the graffiti on the large oil painting before being tackled to the ground by steward Peter Crook. He told Mr Crook: 'Sorry mate, I’ve got nothing against the Queen,' before telling a police officer who arrived at the scene that he was 'guilty as charged'. Photographs of the incident were posted on a Fathers4Justice Facebook page. Haries decided to represent himself towards the end of his trial and directly addressed jurors, telling them he carried out the act as a protest against the 'social catastrophe' of fathers not being allowed access to their children. He said that, while he had nothing . against the Queen personally, he targeted her portrait because of her . symbolic role as head of the justice system. Haries, . of Doncaster, later said he 'would not hesitate to petition the Queen . again by peaceful protest on behalf of my children and the millions of . children separated from their fathers by the British Government'. Vandalism: The portrait, left, was hanging in Westminster . Abbey when it was defaced by Tim Haries who scrawled the word Help in purple paint, right, in this image posted on the Fathers4Justic Facebook page . The portrait by artist Ralph Heimans was cordoned off by a rope in the Abbey’s Chapter House as part of a wider exhibition to celebrate the Queen’s Diamond Jubilee. The 11ft by 9ft painting was bought by Westminster Abbey for £160,000 after being on display in the artist’s native Australia. Repairing the damage cost £9,204, the court was told, with insurers paying £4,000 and an excess of £5,000. The . oil on canvas depicts the Queen in the sacrarium of Westminster Abbey, . also known as the Coronation Theatre, standing at the centre circle of . the Cosmati pavement, on the spot where she was crowned. The . judge said he was in no position to come to any informed conclusions . about why the Family Court ultimately denied Haries access to his . children - other than to observe that in the system of family justice, . the needs and interests of the children were paramount. 'I . accept that your separation from your daughters for a period of four . years caused you real anguish. I also accept that you felt that the . legal processes by which you tried to have contact with them had failed . you. 'But I do not accept that the means that you chose to adopt to make your protest were in any way justified. 'This was, in reality, a choice you made, not a sudden ill-considered act under immediate provocation.' Support: Tim Haries was jailed for six months at Southwark Crown Court today where he was joined by supporters from the campaign goup Fathers4Justice . Haries had prepared by buying a can of spray paint and taking it into the Abbey, the judge said. 'You caused damage to the painting, disappointment to those who had come to see it, cost to the Abbey and their insurance in putting it right, and almost certainly some degree of offence to many people who would regard an attack on a portrait of the monarch as unacceptable. 'I am satisfied that your assertion that you intended to do no more than cause damage which could be easily repaired is simply not true. 'I have no doubt that you intended to do as much damage as you could, and it was only the intervention of Mr Crook that limited the damage to the extent that it was possible to repair the painting at a cost less than £10,000.' The judge said the opportunity to have close access to works of art was greatly valued by many people. 'Those who act as you did put that opportunity at risk. It would be a sad day when works of art can only be viewed from a distance or from behind barriers.' Haries had about 20 supporters in court for the hearing and there were shouts directed towards the judicial bench at the end of 'disgusting', 'shame on you' and 'Fathers4Justice'. There was also a shout of 'how about justice?' during the judge’s sentencing remarks and he threatened to have the court cleared before two supporters gave undertakings not to make further interruptions. Costly: Artist Ralph Heimans with his painting: The Coronation Theatre; Portrait of Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth ll - worth £160,000 - which was defaced by Fathers4Justice campaigner Tim Haries . After the hearing the group said in a press release issued to journalists that Haries had begun a hunger strike after being sent to prison, in protest at the 'politically motivated' sentence. It read: 'He will continue his hunger strike until his case is reopened and he is reunited with his daughters.' In the statement, Haries wrote: 'I hereby declare that the judge’s decision to ignore the Probation Service’s recommendation of a community service order and replace it with a custodial sentence leaves me with no alternative than to enter an immediate hunger strike. 'I consider that as the custodial sentence is well outside of the Probation Service recommendations, this can only be a political motivated decision. I therefore now regard myself as a political prisoner. 'My only crime is to fight to see my two daughters whom I love dearly, after being ordered to abandon them by the family courts. 'My children and I have done nothing to warrant such treatment by the courts and our Government.' He revealed he had made a final application to the Family Courts to be reunited with his children and added: 'My fast will continue until this application is granted. 'Until this application is granted I will accept nothing but water, no food, sugar, glucose, vitamins, supplements etc. I hereby insist that any medical examinations are conducted by an external and independent doctor.'","Tim Haries, 42, was guilty of criminal damage of more than £5,000 .

"Baby George has been likened to Elvis with his quiff . When most families show off their newborns for the first time many draw similarities with their mother's nose or eyes. But when George Georgious was born there was only one comparison - Elvis. The ten week old child was born with a full head of black hair which has formed into a natural quiff and sideburns. The youngster's hair style has opposed any attempts to brush his style flat and has retained his quiff. His parents Maria and Chris Georgious hope to nurture their son's musical links and have bought an Elvis CDs for his nursery. Mrs Georgious, 29, said: 'When he was born he had lots of hair - and I mean lots. It was already a little quiff which was about three centimetres high. 'I took his little brush into hospital and as soon as I saw his hair I thought 'oh my god, he's got a little quiff. We've got the next Elvis'. 'It is growing so quickly and it is already two inches high. 'I've compared him to pictures of Elvis and it is the same mop of hair, with the quiff on the top and flat at the back and sides. 'What's even better is it does it all on its own. I don't have to do anything to it.' The couple, from Palmers Green in London are both Greek and suspected their first born might have long locks when he arrived on August 11. But former-hairdresser Mrs Georgious puts her son's hair down to lots of Mars bars and and digestive problems she had during pregnancy. She suffered with ulcer colitis - a form of irritable bowel syndrome - when she fell pregnant, and doctors even suggested she terminate her pregnancy. Mother Maria Georgious thinks her son's quiff may be due to the daily Mars bars she ate during her pregnancy . George was born with his hair shaped into a natural quiff (left) and has kept the Elvis Presley style hairdo . Baby George is now 10 weeks old and people often comment on how similar the youngster looks to Elvis . The couple hope Baby George will be inspired by his Elvis hairstyle and have bought an Elvis CD for the nursery . But she persisted and kept up her energy with a Mars bar a day. She added: 'I read that digestive problems like indigestion can result in children having more hair so it might be that. Baby George was born with a full head of hair (left) and still bears a striking resemblance to Elvis Presley . George's parents suspected their Greek heritage would leave their son to be born with a full head of hair . People regularly stop baby George's parents to remark on how his hair makes him look like the music icon . Maria Georgious continued with her pregnancy despite doctors advising her she should terminate it . Mrs Georgiou said she played a lot of music while she was pregnant, but Whitney Houston rather than Elvis . 'But I also had a Mars bar every day and each time George would give a little kick, so maybe it was that. 'I did listen to a lot of music when I was pregnant, mostly Whitney Houston, Michael Jackson, and Mariah Carey. 'No Elvis Presley, but we are certainly going to get him CDs now - I'd love if he was a musical baby.'","George Georgious was born with full head of black hair shaped into a quiff .

"FBI director James Comey is calling Apple's new privacy features a boon to kidnappers, pedophiles, and terrorists. New encryption standards for iPhones and iPads requiring a key to unlock text messages, pictures, and emails 'put people beyond the law,' Comey claimed in a recent interview. With the new technology, a text message is scrambled on Apple's servers and can only be decrypted with the receiver's iPhone password, preventing law enforcement from getting the data from Apple. FBI director James Comey says Apple's new privacy features will make vital information inaccessible to law enforcement . Google is following suit on Android phones. Comey voiced his concerns in an interview with 60 minutes. 'The notion that people have devices... that with court orders, based on a showing of probable cause in a case involving kidnapping or child exploitation or terrorism, we could never open that phone? My sense is that we've gone too far when we've gone there,' Comey said. He compared encrypted iPhones to 'cars with trunks that couldn't ever be opened by law enforcement with a court order.' But as CNN Money points out, it's a problematic comparison. The FBI can still get phone data if they get a warrant or a federal court order forcing you to turn your phone over to them. The FBI can still get phone data if they get a warrant or a federal court order forcing you to turn your phone over to them . Plus making messages easily accessible to law enforcement would also mean making them easily accessible to hackers looking to steal your information. New York attorney Joel Kurtzberg told CNN Money that the only real change with Apple's new guidelines is it forces law enforcement to be open about seeking data. 'This is going to make it harder for law enforcement,' said Kurtzberg, who specializes in First Amendment cases. 'And it will result in instances where someone will destroy evidence.'","James Comey says encrypted messages will keep vital information out of law enforcement's hands .

"Threat: Native American students say they have been threatened online following the Jaylen Fryberg shootings, and are afraid to return to school . Native American Indian students in Washington state say they are afraid to return to classrooms after being threatened online following the  Jayden Fryberg shootings. Fryberg, 15, who killed two of his friends before committing suicide on Friday last week, belonged to the Tulalip Tribes, and has been widely pictured wearing a native American Indian headdress. Now members of the same tribe at schools across the Marysville district say they have been threatened on Twitter. A spokesman for the tribes said: 'Schools in the Marysville School District have received threats. 'Many of our kids are fearful to return to school, and some parents are reluctant to send them. 'The Tulalip Tribes denounce the horrific actions of Jaylen Fryberg, who took the lives of two of his classmates and grievously injured three others. 'All of the young people he attacked were his friends, and two were his cousins. Parents and children alike are struggling to understand what caused him to act in such a manner. 'Even though we may never know why, there can be no justification for taking the lives of others. 'These were the acts of an individual, not a family, not a tribe.' The Tulalip Tribes are based on a 22,000-acre reservation west of Marysville and attend many of the local schools. A specific threat was made against Heritage High School which is predominantly Native American and sits on the tribe's reservation, according to NBC News. While a spokesman for the tribes refused to give details on the threat, she said it was found to be unsubstantiated. She added: 'As our communities continue to come together to deal with this tragic event, our thoughts and prayers continue to go out to the families of Zoe Galasso and Gia Soriano. 'We continue to pray for the recovery of Andrew Fryberg, Nate Hatch, and Shaylee Chuckulnaskit and their families. 'It is our custom to come together in times of grief. The tribe holds up our people who are struggling through times of loss. 'We are supporting the family of Jaylen Fryberg in their time of loss, but that does not mean we condone his actions. Scroll down for video . Heritage: Fryberg was a member of the Tualip Tribes, with the group saying their members have been the targets of abuse. The tribe issues a statement saying the shootings were 'the acts of an individual' Love triangle? Fryberg's crush Zoe Galasso (right) died at the scene. He had allegedly become heartbroken when she started dating his cousin Andrew Fryberg (left). Andrew  is still in critical condition at the hospital . Victim: Gia Soriano (pictured) died on Sunday from her injuries in the shooting at Marysville-Pilchuck High School . 'We are grateful for the outpouring of support we are receiving from our neighbors, other tribes and organizations, and from around the world. Your thoughts and prayers have held us up.' The news comes after it was revealed on Monday that Fryberg invited his victims to lunch by text message, then shot them at their table. Detectives are digging through reams of text messages, phone and social media records as part of an investigation that could take months, Snohomish County Sheriff Ty Trenary said . 'The question everybody wants is, ""Why?""'Trenary said. 'I don't know that the ""why"" is something we can provide.' Fryberg, a football player who was named a prince on the school's Homecoming court one week before the killings, was a member of a prominent Tulalip Indian Tribes family. He seemed happy although he was also upset about a girl, friends said. It appears that girl was 14-year-old victim Zoe Galasso, who had recently started dating his cousin Andrew Fryberg, currently in critical condition at the hospital. The shooter's Twitter feed was recently full of vague, anguished postings, like 'It won't last ... It'll never last,' and 'I should have listened. ... You were right ... The whole time you were right.' On Friday, after texting five friends to invite them to lunch, he pulled out a handgun in the cafeteria and started shooting. Zoe died at the scene while friend Gia Soiano, 14, died at the hospital from her injuries on Sunday. Hospitalized: Shaylee Chuculnaskit (left) and Nate Hatch (right) remain hospitalized from their injuries.  On Monday, Hatch's condition was upgraded to satisfactory . Shaylee Chuckulnaskit, 14, remains in critical condition at the hospital, along with Fryberg's two cousins, Nate Hatch, 14, and Andrew, 15. Hatch, who was shot in the jaw, is the only victim who has shown improvement. He was upgraded to satisfactory condition Monday in intensive care at Harborview Medical Center in Seattle, while Andrew  remained in critical condition there. It has been claimed Jaylen had a crush on Zoe Galasso and became heartbroken when she dated his cousin, Andrew. Zoe was sitting around a table with her friends at Marysville-Pilchuck High School on Friday when Jaylen Fryberg opened fire. She was pictured attending the homecoming dance at the Washington school with Andrew Fryberg after she and Jaylen Fryberg fell out, just days before the deadly attack. Jaylen had previously treated Andrew like a brother, and was devastated to learn the girl who rejected him and chosen his cousin instead. In an ominous indication of the anger that spurred his deadly tirade, Jaylen tweeted last month: 'Dude. She tells me everything. And now I f***ing HATE you! Your no longer my 'Brother'!' The teenage girls are believed to be friends of Jaylen Fryberg, with witnesses suggesting he targeted them in a room full of hundreds of students. Lukas Thorington, 14, a freshman at Marysville's other public high school who grew up with Zoe and Shaylee said they were outgoing, popular kids. Passed: Plastic cups sit at memorial Monday, October 27, 2014 at Marysville Pilchuck High School in Washington State. The cups cover candles and bear the names of  Zoe Galasso, right, and Gia Soriano, left, both 14, who were killed when Jaylen R. Fryberg, 15, named on the center candle, opened fire on Friday, October 24 . He told the Seattle Times: 'Zoe was very outgoing. She was into sports. She was nice and awesome. She was fun to hang out with.' Corey Williams, 37, is friends with Zoe's mother and wanted to help, so he set up a fundraising page to raise money for the Galasso family. Donations have already exceeded $14,000. He told the paper: 'I'm pretty surprised. I put $10,000 as the goal as a pie-in-the-sky thing. I'm shocked.' A picture uploaded to Facebook shows Shaylee posing alongside the Jaylen Fryberg. The popular schoolboy who was a member of the football and wrestling team shot five people with his father's gun, before turning the gun on himself. A friend on Twitter said Jaylen was 'heartbroken' over a girl and didn't know what to do. She added that he 'wasn't a bad kid'. He had also written messages on his own Twitter page suggesting he may have been facing some troubles, such as: 'It breaks me... It actually does.' After her passing on Sunday, Gia's family said her organs would be donated. 'We are devastated by this senseless tragedy,' her family said in a statement, read at a news conference by Providence Regional Medical Center's Dr. Joanne Roberts. 'Gia is our beautiful daughter, and words cannot express how much we will miss her.' Meanwhile, Nate Hatch has taken to Twitter to forgive his 'brother' Jaylen for the shooting which has left him seriously injured. On Monday he wrote: 'I love you and I forgive you jaylen rest in peace' while in the intensive care unit at Harborview Medical Center in Seattle where he is being treated for a gunshot wound to his jaw. Nate also took to Facebook to update his friends saying he was 'grateful to be alive' after his condition was upgraded from serious to satisfactory. Forgiveness: Nate (pictured with gunman Jaylen Fryberg left) was his cousin and best friend. They called each other brother . Spokeswoman Susan Gregg says he's awake and breathing on his own and still in the intensive care unit. Nate and Jaylen grew up together in the Native American Tulalip tribe along with Andrew Fryberg, 15, another brother-like cousin who is in a critical condition in Harborview Medical Center following the attack. Nate's grandfather, Donald Hatch, revealed Nate started communicating with his family by writing notes as he is unable to speak. Mr Hatch told King5 reporter Alex Rozier that Nate knows it was his close cousin Jaylen who opened fire on the group of friends. He said one of the notes Nate had written to his family reads: 'Grandpa, I still have a bullet in my chest'. Mr Hatch added: I think Nate's either getting his memory back or somebody mentioned what had happened. 'And it kind of broke his heart to hear, ""why would my brother do that to me,"" even though they're cousins. 'Why would my brother do that to me?"" Last week Nate's mother, Denise Hatch-Anderson wrote on Facebook, thanking the community for their support in the aftermath of the shooting. She wrote: 'Thank you so much from the mother of Nate Hatch... i cant [sic] thank everyone from our community for the outpouring love that has been shown [sic] to me since this tragic happened... i love everyone!!! No time for hate just love.' Mourners gather at a memorial set up outside Marysville Pilchuck high School on Monday, October 27 . Francesca Tuazon, 17, left, and Nicole Buell, 17, right, bring flowers and balloons to the growing memorial on Monday . Trenary also confirmed that the .40-caliber handgun used in the shooting had been legally purchased by one of Fryberg's relatives. It remains unclear how Fryberg obtained the weapon. The Snohomish County Medical Examiner on Monday ruled Fryberg's death a suicide. There had been some question over whether he might have shot himself accidentally as a teacher tried to intervene, but Trenary said Monday that investigators confirmed there was no physical contact between the teacher and the gunman. At the memorial outside the school Monday, a group of mourners hugged each other tightly at 10:39am — the minute the shooting was reported Friday. Flowers and signs were zip-tied to a chain-link fence lined with red and white balloons reflecting the school's colors. Many referenced the victims and said they'd be missed.","Native American Indian pupils in Washington report being threatened online .

He told the Sun on Sunday: 'There has been a lot of tension. Our personal lives drove us apart. 'We used to be such a brotherly pact, but it started to feel like it wasn't The Wanted anymore.' Max added that when The Wanted's manager Scooter Braun, who also manages Justin Bieber, asked the boys what they wanted to do after their tour, the divide became even more apparent. And it was Max and bandmate Nathan Sykes who pushed for the split, despite Tom Parker, Siva Kanesawaran and Jay McGuiness' fierce opposition to the idea . He said: 'As upsetting as it might be to some of the other guys, I have to live my life. 'Me and Nathan have been just as loyal to this project as anyone else - sometimes you just have to be realistic.' The fact that the group were axed by . their record label Universal also added pressure, with Max revealing the . boys had to sit down and have an 'open and honest conversation' about . their future without a label. Happier times: The boys are calling it a day after four years together . Now Scooter has signed both Max and Nathan as solo artists, but Max insisted the tensions in the band won't cause difficulties when they are on tour, because all five singers are 'professional' and determined to give fans the best show possible. Now the boys all have their own solo projects to focus on, with Max admitting he is keen to make the move from singing to acting, and has already been signed up with Creative Artists Agency in Los Angeles. And with a happy relationship with Sports Illustrated model Nina Agdal, as well as the promise of acting roles and a solo music career, Max has a lot to look forward to. But he added of the future of The Wanted: 'We've had four amazing years. We always wanted to be the best we could so it was right to end it now after ten Top Ten single and ten million records.' Moving on: Max is now planning to move to Los Angeles to pursue an acting career, and also has his relationship with the stunning Nina Agdal to focus on .","Rows over girlfriends and pressure over poor sales led to tensions .

"ISIS are infamous for publishing gruesome videos of beheadings or footage of soldiers training - but it seems they have now taken a softer tact in an attempt to appeal to women. The militants have begun publishing guides for Islamic State wives on how to be 'ultimate wives of jihad' complete with cartoon illustrations on a pink background. The videos include guides on how to perform basic first aid, what to cook for Islamists after battles, and how to stitch up damaged clothing. ISIS have published videos trying to encourage more women to join their cause by outlining 'feminine manual labour' they can do to help the jihadists, instead of joining in the fighting . Among the tasks listed are basic first aid and cooking - along with 'quick and simple' recipe suggestions including date balls which 'will extend the power and strength of the mujahadeen' The videos were published on Twitter and Facebook by the Zora Foundation, an arm of ISIS that is seeking to recruit women to the cause, and give advice to those already in Syria and Iraq. Their slogan is 'preparing for the honour of jihad' and their online accounts - which post only in Arabic - have attracted thousands of followers so far. Among the tips given out are some 'quick and simple' recipes, such as one for 'date balls' that are made by mixing dates, flour and butter together. As ISIS's strict religious code forbids women from fighting, instead they are told to assist jihad by sewing clothes and editing propaganda videos . The guide says: 'This is a quick recipe that can be served to the mujahedin [IS militants] with coffee or can be eaten at any time with water, especially during breaks in battles. They contain significant calories and will extend the power and strength of the mujahadeen, Allah willing.' Charlie Winter, of the anti-extremist group Quilliam Foundation, told The Independent: 'I haven't seen anything like this before. Aqsa Mahmood, 20, a British jihadi, is thought to be leading the all-female al-Khanssaa brigade which operated in the de-fact ISIS capital of Raqqa . 'There will probably be forums doing similar things online, but this is the first time I've come across an actual media organisation giving guidance to women on their role. 'The phenomenon of women going over to Syria or Iraq is not new and it is not a purely Western phenomenon. There are more women going from countries like Saudi Arabia.' ISIS strictly forbid women from taking part in combat, and so the propaganda films instead focus on how to assist jihad through 'feminine manual labour'. Among the suitable tasks given to women is producing and editing slideshows and film footage, in an effort to make more propaganda, and participating in 'jihadi science' - which is not explained further. It is not known exactly how many women have joined ISIS, but it is common for men signing up to take their wives to fight alongside them. There are two all-female brigades operating in the de-facto capital of Raqqa, in Syria, including al-Khanssaa, which is thought to be lead by Aqsa Mahmood, 20, a British female jihadi. The brigade, whose job is to patrol the streets of Raqqa enforcing strict Sharia law, is thought to include up to sixty female radicals from the UK.","ISIS is trying to encourage more women to join jihad with online guides .

"Thierry Henry has admitted that he would love to return to Arsenal one day - and win the Champions League with them. The Frenchman does not envisage returning to the Gunners as a player for the third time, but he would be interesting in heading back to North London in a coaching capacity or another role. Henry, 37, is still playing for the New York Red Bulls in the MLS and netted 10 times last season but is already contemplating his future.

One thing is certain: I will stay in football, as a coach, a consultant or executive. We will see. 'The second certainty is that I would love to see Arsenal win the Champions League.' And Henry, who scored 226 goals for the Gunners between 1999 and 2007 before returning to net twice in seven appearances in 2012, admits he would love to be a part of any potential European success at the Emirates. He continued: 'Whether that is from near or far does not depend on me but it is sure I'd like to help. 'This is my club and, as a player, I was not able to give them the Champions League.'

"The coin was tossed and I was sent to Anfield where the title could have ended up. But didn’t. It didn’t stop the fans giving us 'visitors' the usual atmosphere before and after the game. You don’t need to have played the game to realise that defensively the Reds haven’t got it quite right yet. But are all their defenders no good? Was Simon Mignolet part of the problem? And the celebration of Steven Gerrard’s deeper role doesn’t take into account the possibility that change might have weakened the team defensively. So let’s assess those points. Bear in mind that Liverpool want to get even better – they’ve had an excellent season, but Brendan Rodgers won’t want to stand still. Safe hands? Simon Mignolet is an excellent shot-stopper, but his distribution needs work . An own goal put Newcastle in front, Yoan Gouffran should have made it two when he burst clear, and even when the visitors had players sent off there were times when the Liverpool back four looked like they could crack at any moment. Why? Rodgers plays a 4-3-3 as his preferred tactic, and two of that back four are attack-minded fullbacks. If that system is going to work, you need at least one world class centre half, ideally two. Daniel Agger and Martin Skrtel don’t fit the bill in my view – not for the domestic and European glory Liverpool should be aspiring to. You can get away with one of them over a season but not both, not if you want to be champions. I’m sure most Liverpool fans would agree when I say they still haven’t replaced Jamie Carragher. Mignolet has had a decent season, I don’t think goalkeeper is a position that Rodgers needs to address. It’s that defence. Jon . Flanagan has had an unexpectedly brilliant season and shouldn’t be . discarded; but I suspect Glen Johnson’s 11 minutes from hell at Crystal . Palace will have set alarm bells ringing at Anfield. Double trouble: Martin Skrtel (left) and Daniel Agger can both be replaced . Calamintous: Glen Johnson (No 2) was found wanting as Crystal Palace scored three goals in nine minutes to derail their title charge . Leader: Vincent Kompany clutches the Premier League trophy for the second time in three years . If you look at why Man City pipped Liverpool to the title, it isn’t because Gerrard slipped over, or because City have rich owners – only the most shallow and basic football debaters would think that. It’s because they had some superb players, led by the main man at the back – the kind of central defensive rock most successful teams have. Vincent Kompany showed everyone what a quality footballer and leader he is during the run-in. Without him you always felt City were weaker. He’s so brilliant he’s even made Martin Demichelis looked good. If Liverpool can go and find a Kompany, they have a chance of firmly establishing themselves back at the very top level where their fans feel they belong. Good luck finding him though. This is a manager who headbutted an opposition player on the touchline during a game. So a disciplinarian he is not. A point highlighted by the fact he shook Shola Ameobi’s hand when the striker was sent off, and patted Paul Dummett on the head when he saw red. Regardless of whether these two players deserved to go (I thought the Dummett red was ridiculously harsh) the manager has to deal with that situation better when he’s the most public face and figurehead of a football club. Ameobi was barking non-stop at the referee which is why he saw a second yellow, so is Pardew happy with that? And . while Dummett shouldn’t have gone in my view, his foul was cynical and . worthy of a yellow. Is Pardew patting him on the head for that reason? No self-discipline: Alan Pardew (right) protests at Anfield as a miserable season ends in defeat for Newcastle . Whatever he says to the players in the privacy of the dressing room, the manager of Newcastle United cannot be seen to be condoning ill-discipline on the touchline, especially given his actions earlier this season. There are some positives to Pardew’s management – when his teams are playing well they are a joy to watch. He achieved good things at West Ham, and Reading before that. But after a disappointing spell at Southampton, he has been given a fantastic opportunity at a club with huge potential. He’s not making the most of his incredible good fortune to be in the hotseat at St James’ Park. His reputation right now is that he is a manager with no self-discipline. He’s setting that tone for his players, too, it seems. Has it been a good season for referees or not? They get the blame from managers who want to deflect from their own errors of course, so a lot of the things they’re criticised for aren’t actually legitimate. I’d rather talk about football than referees, but my one criticism of the men in the middle this season is that I’ve seen too many who simply do not watch the game closely enough. Phil Dowd was the referee at Anfield on Sunday and for me he summed up the problem with referees this season. I think he is one of the better refs and actually I don’t think he had a bad game. The man in black: Phil Dowd brandishes red to Paul Dummett . But I don’t know what he saw in the Dummett challenge to regard that as a straight red, rather than a yellow. It wasn’t a clear goalscoring opportunity, it wasn’t serious foul play – studs weren’t high, he wasn’t airborne and out of control – so I just can’t understand what Dowd saw in that incident. What was he watching? Dowd’s other fault was that he was too willing to 'buy' free kicks won by Raheem Sterling. I like Sterling a lot, and some would call it clever when mid-chase with ball at feet, he will 'bump' into the opponent tracking him – he throws a shape which necessitates contact with his man and goes down. He did it for the free kick that led to the winning goal. It’s surprising Dowd didn’t watch it properly, if he had he wouldn’t have been deceived. If it was my club I wouldn’t be bothered about Sterling 'winning' free-kicks – we all know how the heart rules the head when it comes to football. So if Sterling does it for England, good luck to him! But if he doesn’t win a free kick, that will be a referee doing his job properly. Going to ground: Raheem Sterling (left) battles with Yoan Goaffran on the . Dowd also had no reason to disallow Luis Suarez’s brilliant early free kick: he wasn’t even looking so he couldn’t possibly know the ball was rolling, if indeed it hadn’t stopped moving by the time Suarez connected. That was a referee spoiling a special moment in a game because he wasn’t watching what was going on; instead he was too busy being mates with a Newcastle player and having a chat. Simple advice for refs – watch the game closely. You’ll make fewer mistakes. There was something very fitting when, with Liverpool lacking the craft and guile to get back on level terms with Newcastle, Suarez running around like a headless chicken, and pot shots reigning in from 30 yards going nowhere, up stepped the Liverpool captain yet again to drag his team to victory. Steven Gerrard is a stunning player. His set-piece delivery is still way ahead of anyone else in the Premier League, and his free-kicks led the Reds to victory. Well into his thirties, Gerrard has this season captained a team that has gone from seventh to second, he has excelled in a new position, helped instill discipline into Suarez, and been the perfect example of a brilliant captain. He also skippered his country to World Cup qualification unbeaten, and scored the goal to seal a trip to Brazil in the final group game. So near and yet so far: Steven Gerrard saw his Premier League title dream shattered . Put all of those things together and Liverpool don’t get close to second spot without him. That’s why he pips Suarez for me. And too many bandwagon-jumpers started shouting about Yaya Toure once they realised City were going to win the title. Toure has had another excellent season and made a massive contribution to City’s title success. But you can’t be player of the season if your manager sees fit to take you off for tactical reasons when you only have a slender lead at Everton. The fact that City held on to their advantage means the manager was right, and Toure wasn’t needed. That would never happen with Gerrard.  I hope Gerrard’s imperious form continues to the World Cup. I sense people foaming at the mouth and dribbling on their keyboards muttering: 'What about when he slipped over and gave the ball to Demba Ba?' Everyone can make a mistake, but the saddest part of that is not that it cost Liverpool the title, but that it really is all Chelsea have got to celebrate this season.","Liverpool's defence is what cost them the title .

"Apple has announced a global programme to replace all third-party and counterfeit USB power adaptors. The move comes after a Chinese woman was reportedly electrocuted while using a non-Apple charger. The technology giant has said consumers can buy an authentic USB adaptor for the equivalent of $10 (£6.51). Apple has announced a global programme to replace all third-party and counterfeit USB power adaptors. The move comes after a Chinese woman was reportedly electrocuted while using a non-Apple charger . Apple chargers normally cost around £15 in the UK. Ma Ailun, 23, collapsed and died in China last month after answering her iPhone while it was charging. Apple did not specifically refer to this incident as it launched the charger replacement programme, but said: 'Recent reports have suggested that some counterfeit and third-party adaptors may not be designed properly and could result in safety issues. 'While not all third party adaptors have an issue, we are announcing a USB Power Adaptor Takeback Programme to enable customers to acquire properly designed adaptors. 'Customer safety is a top priority at Apple.' The Apple initiative will take place from August 16 to October 18. Anyone who wants to take up the offer will have to provide the serial number of their iPhone, iPad or iPod, and hand over a USB charger . Phil Buckle, director general of the Electrical Safety Council, also warned about the dangers of cheap USB chargers. 'Whilst everyone loves a bargain, if a cheap electrical product turns out to be fake then it is, at best, a waste of money. At worst, it could result in the death of a loved one,' he said. More than four million counterfeit goods were seized coming into the UK last year and one of the top fakes was phone chargers. 'This is worrying as faulty electrical goods are a leading cause of severe electric shock in the UK and cause thousands of house fires each year,' said Buckle. 'Counterfeit electrical goods almost always contain incorrect or faulty parts that can overheat or break just days after purchase. 'If the price is too good to be true, it probably is.' The Apple initiative will take place at stores and participating authorised service providers from August 16 to October 18.

"A father and son have appeared in a New York court accused of using their Medicaid-funded, not-for-profit drug-rehab operation to cream off $4 million through an alleged extortion and insurance fraud scheme. Narco Freedom CEO Alan Brand, 64, and his son Jason, 35, are accused of using the cash to fund lavish lifestyles including several large houses and a fleet of luxury cars, according to charges filed on Wednesday. The father and son were led into the Bronx Supreme Court in handcuffs by officers of state Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, whose office had carried out the investigation. Narco Freedom CEO Alan Brand, right, and his son Jason, left, are accused of using the cash to fund lavish lifestyles including several large houses and a fleet of luxury cars . According to the indictment, Alan Brand is being charged with insurance fraud, money laundering, bribery, and grand larceny. His son, Jason Brand, faces grand larceny and insurance fraud charges. Both Brands have been charged with filing false documents to obtain a $3.5 million insurance payout for the restoration of a Narco office in Brooklyn, reports the New York Daily News. The remaining $600,000 came from kickbacks Alan Brand collected from the owners of the facility properties, the AG said. Schneiderman's office has frozen the pair's bank accounts and seized assets including two mansions on Long Island, and condos in Boynton Beach and Boca Raton, Florida. This electric yellow 1969 Corvette is one of six luxury cars owned by Alan and Jason Brand that the New York state Attorney General has impounded . Six luxury cars, including an electric yellow 1969 Corvette, an $80,000 Tesla and a 2002 Jaguar X have also been impounded. Both father and son have pleaded not guilty to the insurance fraud charges. They face up to 25 years in prison if convicted. The pair are now under investigation for embezzlement of Medicaid funds. 'The people’s investigation has only just started,' Assistant AG Kristen Anne Conklin wrote in seeking bail for the Brands. The father was freed on $225,000 bail and the son was freed on $178,000 bail on Wednesday. Other luxury cars belonging to the Brands which have been seized include this Buick, left, and Hyundai, right . As well as founding his luxury lifestyle, Alan Brand had donated to numerous political campaigns, including $10,000 into Gov. Cuomo’s re-election, $2,300 to Hillary Rodham Clinton’s 2008 presidential run, nearly $30,000 to Bronx pols. He also gave $8,000 to Schneiderman' office, which will now be given to charity. An AG official, who explained that returning them any earlier would have tipped the Brands to the probe. Narco Freedom operates methodone clinics and so-called ‘sober houses’ across the Bronx and receives about $38 million from Medicaid annually, plus has $6.3 million in state contracts.","Narco Freedom CEO Alan Brand, 64, and his son Jason, 35, are accused of using the cash to fund their lavish lifestyles .

"Steven Gerrard was able to laugh at himself after being taunted about his slip against Chelsea.

Manchester City are now on the brink of a second title in three years, with a point against West Ham on Sunday enough to claim the trophy. Liverpool play Newcastle at Anfield.

"A farm owner who forced a vulnerable man to work for him for 13 years without pay has been jailed for four and a half years. Missing Kidderminster man Darrell Simester was found in an appalling state on Cariad Farm near Newport, south Wales, last year. Jailing Doran, Judge Neil Bidder told Cardiff Crown Court: 'In truth, you did not treat him much better than a slave.' David Dan Doran, left, forced Darrell Simester, right,  to work on his farm for 13 years without pay . Cardiff Crown Court heard that Mr Simester lived in a rat-infested caravan for a decade and would wash himself in an animal trough after working 15 hour days for farm owner David Dan Doran. Mr Simester's parents Tony and Jean described their eldest child as unrecognisable and looking more like a man in his nineties when reunited with him. In a statement outside the court today, Mr Simester's father Tony said:' What our son Darrell went through for 13 years was appalling and caused a lot of damage and harm. Thankfully since returning home, he continues to recover both mentally and physically. 'I have to ask the people of Wales and the rest of the UK to be extra vigilant at all times. This form of slavery could be happening right under your noses. 'Co-ordinated efforts between police and other agencies with the assistance of the public are required to stamp it out. I can only hope that by working together another family will be saved from the hardship we have encountered.' Speaking outside the court, Tony Simester, left, said his son Darrell, right is slowly recovering from his ordeal . Mr Simester was held in a caravan on the Cariad Farm near Newport, south Wales between 2010 and 2013 . Cardiff Crown Court today heard that, given the long hours Mr Simester worked, he could have earned more than £200,000 if paid the minimum wage. Judge Neil Bidder said it was clear horse breeder Doran had taken advantage of a man with low intelligence. 'What our son Darrell went through for 13 years was appalling and caused a lot of damage and harm. Thankfully since returning home, he continues to recover both mentally and physically. 'I have to ask the people of Wales and the rest of the UK to be extra vigilant at all times. This form of slavery could be happening right under your noses. 'Co-ordinated efforts between police and other agencies with the assistance of the public are required to stamp it out. I can only hope that by working together another family will be saved from the hardship we have encountered.' Judge Bidder said: 'He was not paid a penny by you for 13 years of hard labour, without holiday, from 7am to 10 or 11pm. 'At the current minimum wage, you profited by his labour by something over £200,000. 'You cared not at all about his health, which undoubtedly deteriorated during his time at the farm. 'I do not believe you were unaware that he worked for years for you, doing heavy manual labour, with a hernia the size of a grapefruit. 'The threat you knew was held over him was leaving the farm and fending for himself, which he was frightened to do. 'This was economic exploitation of a very inadequate individual of a very serious and ruthless kind. 'You provided him with a roof over his head and food, but in truth you did not treat him much better than a slave.' Mr Simester, 44, was forced to wash in this trough outside after working for 15 hours a day . Mr Simester was living in this caravan when police rescued him from his long-running ordeal . Judge Bidder said: 'This was economic exploitation of a ruthless and serious kind against a very inadequate individual. 'When his parents and elder brother saw him for the first time after 13 years he was barely recognisable and looked like an old man - though he was only 43 years old. 'This offence involved the degradation and exploitation of a vulnerable human being who had lost contact with anyone with whom he could turn to help'. Mr Simester was told that he would be shot and buried in a pit if he ever tried to leave along with the farm's dead horses. Mr Simester met Doran as he was hitch hiking when the farm owner offered him a job in April 2000 . Mr Simester was forced to this outside toilet near the caravan he stayed in while working on the farm . Doran, pictured with his father Daniel outside Cardiff Crown Court was told by Judge Neil Bidder that Mr Simester should have earned in the region of £200,000 even at current minimum wage rates . Prosecutor John Hipkin QC said: 'This is a timid man who for 13 years was forced to work against his will under menace. 'He worked every day starting at 7am and finishing between 10-11pm and didn't receive a penny.' Mr Simester was hitch hiking home from a trip to the seaside in 2000 when Doran gave him a lift and took to take him to his horse breeding farm in Peterstone, near Newport, South Wales. Mr Simester was forced to wash using a horse trough outside a stable on the farm in Newport . He was put to work shovelling manure and carrying out all the tasks on the farm that no one else would do. Cardiff Crown Court heard his family finally found him last year - but he was in such a 'horrific state' they didn't recognise him. Doran was jailed for four-and-a-half years after admitting requiring another human being to perform forced or compulsory labour between April 2010 and March 2013. He escaped punishment for the first 10 years because the law only came in during 2010. The prosecution said that during the three years covered by the charge Mr Simister should have earned between £180,000 and £260,000 in wages, overtime and weekend working. In a victim impact statement Mr Simester's family said when they tracked him down to the farm he was a 'broken man'. The court heard Mr Simester, who was in court to see tormentor being jailed, was now improving in health and was back in the care of his family who are helping him overcome his 13 year ordeal. His father Tony Simester, 67, said: 'This conviction is a vital step towards tackling this type of modern day slavery. 'What Darrell went through for 13 years was appalling and caused a lot of damage and harm. 'Thankfully since returning home he continues to recover both mentally and physically. 'People in the UK should be extra vigilant because this form of slavery could be happening right under their noses. 'It won't be easy to stamp it out but if you have been a victim of this crime or suspect anything please ring then police.' Mr Simester has held at Cariad Farm, pictured,  in Peterstone near Newport, Wales between 2000 and 2013 . After his rescue in March 2013, police launched a major search at the farm owned by Doran . When he was found last year, Mr Simester was wearing these boots, left, and jumper, right, . Catrin Attwell, Senior Crown Prosecutor for the Crown Prosecution Service in Wales said after the case: 'Over a prolonged period Darrell Simester was forced to work extremely long hours for no pay, in pitiful conditions and in a poor physical state. 'At the conclusion of the prosecution case in the trial, David Daniel Doran changed his plea to guilty. He thereby accepted that he deliberately exploited Darrell Simester, a vulnerable and timid man. 'There is no place for any form of modern day slavery in our communities. 'All of us within the criminal justice system are working hard to ensure that those who seek to exploit others in this way face the consequences of their actions. 'If there is a positive to be drawn from this case, I hope it will be to raise public awareness of this issue. 'People in the heart of our local communities are often the ones best placed to spot the signs of exploitation taking place. I would urge anyone who may have any such concerns to contact their local police immediately. 'Today's sentencing concludes the criminal justice process and I hope that this will help Darrell and his family as they seek to move forward with their lives.' Detective Superintendent Paul Griffiths, Senior Investigating Officer for Operation Imperial said: . 'This investigation has been a complicated and protracted enquiry, which has involved a number of different agencies and organisations working together. 'The years of exploitation by Dan Doran Jnr was an appalling betrayal of Darrell Simester, taking advantage of his vulnerable and timid nature.

"Missing: Terror suspect Ibrahim Magag who was under close police surveillance has gone missing . Al Qaeda-linked terror suspect Ibrahim Magag went on the run by calling for a black cab, it was claimed today. The Somali-born 28-year-old was being held under security measures . because of the threat he poses to the public but disappeared on Boxing . Day. Shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper claimed in the Commons he had evaded . detection by calling a taxi and demanded to know why he had been . allowed to return to London. Counter-terrorism detectives made the unusual decision to appeal for . help over the Christmas holidays to trace the extremist after he went . missing. Magag, who is understood to have attended terrorist training camps in . Somalia, absconded from a Terrorism Prevention and Investigation Measure . (Tpim) notice after ripping off his electronic tag. Mrs May insisted the police and security services did not believe Magag . was involved in current terrorist planning and that great efforts were . being made to find him. But Ms Cooper told MPs that a tweet from London taxi news service . Cabwise suggested Somali-born Magag had evaded detection by picking up a . ride less than half-a-mile from Euston station on Boxing Day. In a fierce exchange with Home Secretary Theresa May, Ms Cooper said: . ‘Are you worried that surveillance can be shaken off simply by jumping . into a black cab? Magag, who is thought to have raised funds for al Qaida, was originally . handed a control order and forced to live in the West Country away from . his network of friends. But under the new Tpim regime, introduced last year thanks to support . from the Liberal Democrats, he was able to move back to London. He is described as a black man of Somali origin, 6ft 2in and slim to . medium build. He has a beard, but detectives warned he may try to change . his appearance. He was last seen wearing a khaki robe, a black Berghaus windcheater and navy Converse trainers. Gone: The last sighting of Ibrahim Magag was in the Camden area of north London on Boxing Day . Asking an urgent question in the Commons, Ms Cooper claimed Magag’s . escape had been made easier by the Government stopping relocation of . suspected terrorists. She said: ‘You allowed Magag to return to London. You have not answered . the question about whether it would have been harder to abscond in the . West Country, where he was made to live under a control order - harder . to get help from his associates, harder to hide, harder to get forged . papers.’ Ms Cooper said absconds had stopped under control orders once the powers . were toughened up - including greater use of relocation. And she added: ‘You chose to ditch relocation, you have personally made it easier for people to abscond. ‘Other people previously relocated under control orders are also now . back in London on Tpims. Could any one of them simply jump in a black . cab tomorrow and be off?’ Keith Vaz, who is chairman of the Home Affairs Select Committee, told . the Commons it was understood Magag had forged passports when in . Somalia. He asked Mrs May if Magag was in possession of his passport when he went missing. The Home Secretary said she must consult the details of a previous anonymity order before providing an answer. Defending Tpims, she said terror suspects had absconded before while . under the old restriction - several of whom were never found. She said: ‘In six years of control orders, there were seven absconds and . of those seven cases, six were never apprehended. Magag’s abscond is . serious and the authorities are doing everything they can to locate . him.’","Home Secretary Theresa May quizzed in the Commons about Somalian .

"It was an act of sportsmanship after V8 Supercar veteran Craig Lowndes hugged it out with Warren Luff who took him out in a massive crash during practice ahead of Sunday’s  Bathurst 1000. The brakes on Luff's No.2 Holden Racing Team Commodore appeared to fail as he entered turn two, throwing his car into the tyre barrier and onto its roof at Mount Panorama on Saturday morning. While Luff was unable to arrest his speed, the car clipped the five-time Bathurst champion on the way, sending the veteran into the concrete wall and destroying the rear of the car. Scroll down for video . V8 Supercar driver Warren Luff has escaped injury after a massive crash during practice ahead of Sunday’s Supercheap Auto Bathurst 1000 . But moments later, Lowndes emerged unscathed and immediately ran over to Luff to help him out of the wreckage, before the pair embraced on track. The driver side  was lying on the ground, while Luff tried to escape through the hind side of the HRT Commodore, which he is co-driving with Garth Tander. ‘I'm fine, just obviously very disappointed for the team and obviously for Craig and those guys up the road,’ Luff said after the incident. ‘Big thanks to Craig for helping me get out of the car – that was great.’ Lowndes emerged unscathed and immediately ran over to Luff to help him out of the wreckage, before the pair embraced on track . Warren Luff and Craig Lowndes crash during the Practice 6 at Mount Panorama on Saturday morning . Luff said he floored his brake pedal heading into the corner, but the car wouldn't stop. ‘Something happened,’ he added. ‘I'm not 100 per cent sure what, obviously the guys need to ascertain what's gone wrong.’ Lowndes and Luff were co-drivers at Red Bull last year, winning the Enduro Cup with podium finishes at Sandown, Bathurst and Gold Coast. Luff was later dropped by the team to make way for Steven Richards - who won the 2013 1000km classic with Ford Performance Racing's Mark Winterbottom. The driver side was on lying on the ground, while Luff tried to escape through the hind side of the HRT Commodore . Luff said he floored his brake pedal heading into the corner, but the car wouldn't stop . Luff is this weekend driving with Tander, who also smashed the car during practice on Thursday. The two Commodores had been among the frontrunners to take out the Great Race and were due to fight for pole position in Saturday afternoon's Top 10 shootout. But the significant damage to both is likely to keep them out of contention. ‘I'm just gutted for the whole team,’ Luff said. ‘It's been a big week. Obviously we did some repairs the other night after what happened to Garth on Thursday. ‘I just feel really bad for the guys. Hopefully they can get it back together and we can still be on the grid come tomorrow.’ Luff's brakeless Commodore threw veteran Lowndes into the concrete wall and destroying the rear of the car . The frighteningly fast mountain claimed two other victims during qualifying on Friday, with championship leader Jamie Whincup and FPR's David Reynolds both crashing. Winterbottom was quickest in Saturday's sole practice session, followed by Volvo's Scott McLaughlin and Shane van Gisbergen of Holden. Whincup was 19th.

"A homeowner on a military base has provoked his neighbors' fury after displaying what they believed were effigies of African-Americans being lynched in his front yard for Halloween. The display was outside a residence at Fort Campbell, between Tennessee and Kentucky. The decorations, which were snapped and submitted to ClarksvilleNow.com, appear to show two larger figures along with one smaller person dangling in the air, and are fastened to a tree with rope. Controversy: These Halloween decorations have been accused of showing an African American family being lynched . The figures have black trash bags for heads. At the bottom of the central figure, who has a sign of some sort, a smaller figure is seen holding onto its legs with a knife sticking out of its body. Shocked residents took photos and posted them to Facebook, which attracted more attention to the display. 'Lynching wasn't even on my mind when we put this up. It was the furthest thing from my mind,' Tou Vue, the homeowner who put up the display told KARE. 'I didn't mean to offend anyone and I apologize.'

He said he had just moved to the area and he and his wife  wanted to make a Halloween family out of their leaves. He said the scene showed a dad and son by the tree and mom by the door, but he has now taken them down.

He said if he decorates next year 'we'll just do ghosts and goblins' 'Displays of an offensive nature are not reflective of Army values and the family-friendly environment provided for employees and residents of the Fort Campbell community,' she said. Carpenter also said the homeowner apologized, and that he  had not wished to offend. The Army Times pointed out that WFLA's Facebook commenters have argued online about if the decorations are racist or not. Other commenters on Facebook have argued a moment in the film 'Sinister' was actually recreated by the decorations, the media outlet reported.

"A tattooed model who became an internet sensation after posting a video of herself jiggling her boobs to Mozart says she she's getting death threats after rocketing to Internet stardom. The clip, posted online by  Sara X Mills, showed her moving her breasts individually and simultaneously to the sound of Mozart's Eine kleine Nachtmusik. The hilarious video has now been viewed 26 million times in the space of a week. The viral hit has turned her into an overnight celebrity - bringing both the good and the bad. She says she now gets recognized at the grocery store and has raised money for charity. Scroll down for video . Sara X Mills filmed a video of herself synchronising her chest to a Mozart symphony . The model has revealed that after having breast implants, she was 'delighted' to realize that she could do the 'crazy boob bouncing trick' and had much greater control over her chest movements . Sara X, a former stripper and freelance writer,  says that she was 'bored and uninspired' at the time she recorded the video. Writing on Jezebel the 27-year-old model, who admits her breasts are fake, says she decided to try something new. But she never anticipated the online abuse she would get - and even death threats. 'I know I've definitely been called a w**** and a s*** and an attention w**** far more times than I ever was when I was actually in an adult industry,' Sara says. 'Mostly the people who have negative things to say about my character, or my presumed profession, past profession, and life decisions don't get that the video is meant to be humorous, and operate under the assumption that I just wanted to show the world my boobs.' She adds: 'I won't be too sad when my 15 minutes passes: it's a little disconcerting to have the clerk at the grocery store recognize me as ""the Mozart boob twerk girl."" Only a few people have messaged me death threats; overwhelmingly, the response is positive, and I've raised money for the Breast Cancer Research Foundation, and I am always pleased to hear from people who message me saying that they too are trying to flex their boobs.' She explains: 'I'm not a stranger to putting myself out there, though I had an incredibly conservative upbringing. I became a dancer, not of the ballerina variety. Most of my seven-year 'career' in that field was spent working in bikini bars where stripping and lap dancing were illegal,' she writes. 'I did develop a love for performing using my body as a means of expression. I relied on physical comedy, interacting with the people who sat at my stage and making them feel like we shared an inside joke. I never took myself seriously.' Overnight success: Sara says she had no idea her video would garner over 26 million views worldwide in seven days . 'It never occurred to me to be ashamed of my body or what I was doing with it.' Sara has ensured her achievement goes down in history by recording her boobs in action. The soundtrack Sara chose to showcase her talent was performed by the Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra in 1936. Since she uploaded the piece last week, Sara has been on the receiving end of speculation that she faked the movements. 'About that chest: getting breast implants was a conscious financial decision. Night after night I watched girls with implants have money literally thrown in their faces just for being onstage with those boobs. Naturally, I wanted in on the action!' Viewers accused her of attaching invisible string to her chest, creating an effect similar to a puppeteer, who would move the body parts from above. There was also a far-fetched theory that Sara had been shocking herself electronically to force the movements. But she has since responded to the critics revealing that her fake breasts are the tool that enabled her to move her chest so easily. She said: 'While my boobs are very fake, the video is very real... I am flexing my pectoral muscles and it's moving my implants.' Sara says about her decision to make the video, 'I relied on physical comedy, interacting with the people who sat at my stage and making them feel like we shared an inside joke. I never took myself seriously' 'I've definitely been called a whore and a slut and an attention whore far more times than I ever was when I was actually in an adult industry', Sara says. Sara claims after the breast-enhancing surgery she was able to perform her special trick. 'Post-recovery, I was delighted to realize that I could do the crazy boob bouncing trick I had seen some of my coworkers do since day one. Customers would get all excited about boob bouncing, and I'd think: submuscular implant displacement, mmmm, yea baby.' 'I won't be too sad when my 15 minutes passes: Only a few people have messaged me death threats; overwhelmingly, the response is positive, and I've raised money for the Breast Cancer Research Foundation', Sara says . 'I hadn't seen anyone perform my particular favorite boob trick. So I figured: why not give it a shot? The idea is I want people to think I'm going to come out and sing a song. Then while I do the boob bounce… you know how musicians look in an orchestra while they're playing? I'm going to do that face.' 'Feeling quite pleased with my work, I published the video on Youtube, hoping for maybe 150,000 views total and a few good laughs.  Within an hour, their post of my video had been shared over 1,000 times.Three hours later I was awoken by a barrage of texts saying that my video was beginning to show up on websites that my friends followed. Then it landed on the front page of Reddit. By noon, the count was in the tens of thousands. Emails began to roll in, from people wanting to air my video, to sign me to representation. By the end of the day the views surpassed a million, and the next day was even crazier: the calls and emails included a TMZ interview and a reporter from a very large UK tabloid calling to make an offer for my exclusive story.' Since the story was first posted, interest in Sara's unique talents has now died down, but the views continue to climb and are now close to 26 million hits. She says that she does not read the comments section to avoid reading some of the cruel thoughts people leave. She appears to realize that often fame of this kind of often fleeting but Sara is looking forward to some quieter days ahead .","Sara X Mills filmed a video of herself synchronizing her chest to Mozart .

"Two men accused of the rape and murder of four prostitutes while on parole face the possible death penalty after a grand jury in California agreed to send them forward for trial. Steven Dean Gordon, 45 and Franc Cano, 28, both of Anaheim, California were both indicted by the grand jury in Orange County for four felony counts of special circumstances murder during the commission of rape, kidnapping, lying in wait and multiple rape. They also face four felony counts of forcible rape. According to the Orange County District Attorney's Office, both men, upon conviction face a minimum sentence of life imprisonment without the possibility of parole. Stephen Dean Gordon, left, and Franc Cano, right, face the death penalty after a grand jury in Orange County, California decided to indict them on four felony counts of murder and rape after a three-day hearing . Gordon and Cano were on parole at the time of the crimes and were wearing GPS tracking devices. The DA's office confirmed that the grand jury heard testimony from 16 witnesses over a three-day period before returning the indictment on the fourth day. Both men are expected back in court later today. They have been in custody since their arrest in April. Prosecutors say Cano and Gordon worked together to sexually assault and kill the California women while the men were wearing the tracking devices ordered after prior sex crimes. The monitoring systems helped investigators link the pair to the slayings earlier this year after the body of Jarrae Nykkole Estepp was found at an Anaheim household waste recycling facility. Messages were left for the men's attorneys seeking comment. Gordon and Cano were expected to be arraigned Friday in Orange County Superior Court. Jarrae Nykkole Estepp, 21, from Oklahoma, left, whose body was found on a conveyor belt at a recycling centre in Anaheim prompted the initial investigation which led to the other cases including Martha Anaya, 28, right . Josephine Monique Vargas, left, and Kianna Jackson, 20, right, were also raped and murdered . The case has raised questions about the effectiveness of GPS devices and other forms of parole supervision in tracking offenders and deterring them from committing new crimes. Parole records show the men had escaped supervision together before. In 2010, Cano cut off his GPS device and fled to Alabama, where he was arrested with Gordon. The two were arrested in Las Vegas two years later after cutting off their ankle bracelets, according to court records and state officials. In addition to Estepp, the men are charged with killing Kianna Jackson, 20; Josephine Monique Vargas, 34; and Martha Anaya, 28, last autumn in Santa Ana. Authorities searched for the bodies of the three women for months but gave up in August, saying it was unlikely they'd ever find them because too much time had passed.

"Louis van Gaal will walk straight into a Europa League headache if Manchester United finish sixth in the Premier League on Sunday. United will not cancel a lucrative pre-season tour of the United States if they do qualify for Europe - leaving their new manager the task of picking two different United teams to play in different continents at the same time. VIDEO Scroll down for Incoming United boss Van Gaal shows Dutch squad who is boss . Next step: Louis van Gaal's appointment as United boss is expected to be confirmed in the next few days . July 29 (v Inter Milan): De Gea; Rafael, Jones, Smalling, Evra; Young, Carrick, Fellaini, Mata; Rooney, van Persie . July 31 (Europa League): Lindegaard; Varela, Keane, Evans, Buttner; Zaha, Fletcher, Cleverley, Kagawa; Welbeck, Hernandez . *not including any new signings . United are currently seventh in the table but will move up a place if they win at Southampton and Spurs lose at home to Aston Villa. The sixth-placed team will be required to enter the Europa  League at the third qualifying round stage and the first leg will have to be played on July 31 – less than 48 hours after United are due to meet Inter Milan in the American capital Washington DC. It leaves van Gaal, whose appointment is expected to be confirmed in the next few days, the conundrum of picking one team for a prestigious US tour, and another good enough to ensure they can progress in the Europa League. To add to the complication, United's players who get to the latter stages of the World Cup which ends on July 13 will still be on holiday. United will play at least four games in America this summer in the International Champions Cup between July 23 and August 4.  The second leg of the Europa League tie would be on August 7. No player is likely to be asked to play in both competitions but it does raise the possibility of van Gaal jetting from Washington straight to wherever United's European game is. Positive: Interim boss Ryan Giggs is determined his side should try and win at Southampton . Despite the logistical problems, interim manager Giggs is determined his side should try and give it their all to win at Southampton on Sunday even though Wayne Rooney is still unavailable after only recently returning to training from a groin injury. 'It is a consideration with my team selection as I want to be in Europe. I think United should be in Europe. Obviously everyone wants to be in the Champions League but with the squad we have got it would be good if we were in Europe,' said Giggs. 'I don't think Liverpool (who have not  been in Europe this season) have the size of squad that we've got. I know from the last few weeks the selection problems you do have and that the manager will have next season if there is only one game a week. 'It could be beneficial if we were in the competition. It could bring on players or give people games where they need it. 'I played in Europe at 17 and 18 and it helped me as it was a different experience. It definitely brings you along quicker.' Dilemma: Man United are expected to take stars like Robin van Persie on America tour . The tour is also vitally important to United with managing-director Richard Arnold announcing it to great hype in February. United will warm up against MLS side LA Galaxy in Los Angeles on July 23 and then play in the International Champions Cup against Roma on July 26 in Denver, Inter and Real Madrid in Ann Arbor, Michigan on August 2. The top-placed team will meet the winners of the other group featuring Liverpool, Manchester City, Olympiacos and AC Milan. The American hosts will expect United's big guns to go on tour leaving van Gaal to pick a shadow side for Europe. United have already held internal talks about how to be competitive for both games.","Sixth-placed team will be required to play Europa  League tie on July 31 .

"With a menu of crisped halibut in ginger carrot sauce, compressed avocados and a mango creme brulee, washed down with a shafer chardonnay, it seems the White House had gone all out for last night's private dinner. Which made it a bit of a shame that there was only one item on the menu that guest of honor Narendra Modi could order: a simple glass of warm water. The Indian prime minister was dining with Barak Obama as part of his five-day trip to New York and Washington ahead of formal talks taking place today. Scroll down for video . The Indian prime minister was meeting with Barak Obama for a 'working dinner' as part of his five-day trip to New York and Washington ahead of formal talks taking place today . But since Modi was in the midst of a strict nine-day religious fast, he was unable to enjoy the lavish dinner menu and instead made do with sipping on a glass of warm water, the Wall Street Journal reported. Syed Akbaruddin, a spokesman for the Indian Foreign Ministry, told reporters that as Indian and US officials sat down to dinner, Modi told the group: 'Please don't feel embarrassed and please continue with your food.' So while Modi settled for water, President Barack Obama, Vice President Joe Biden and other officials dined on dishes including crisped halibut, goats cheese and bell peppers, and compressed avocados. Modi, who has described the religious fast as 'a source of strength, power and inspiration', forgoes all food during the nine days of the Hindu festival of Navratri. Prime Minister Narendra Modi (center left) sits across from President Barack Obama (center right) with Indian and US dignitaries, including US Secretary of State John Kerry and Indian Foreign Minister Sushma Swaraj . Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi waves to supporters after paying his respects at a statue of Mahatma Gandhi in front of the Indian embassy in Washington today . After the brief statement, there was no additional talk of his fast. 'There were many other important issues to discuss,' Mr Akbaruddin said. During the 'working dinner', the two leaders vowed  to expand and deepen their countries' strategic partnership and make it a model for the rest of the world. In a joint 'vision statement' issued after their meeting, they said they would work together 'not just for the benefit of both our nations, but for the benefit of the world'. The White House menu  included halibut, goats cheese and bell peppers, and compressed avocados . They said their countries would cooperate on security and to fight terrorism and would back a 'rules based' global order in which India assumes greater multilateral responsibility, including a reformed U.N. Security Council. They also vowed to work together against the threat posed by climate change and to cooperate to address the consequences of unchecked pollution. 'We have a vision that the United States and India will have a transformative relationship as trusted partners in the 21st century. Our partnership will be a model for the rest of the world,'  their statement said. The two leaders also said their countries would work to ensure that economic growth brought better livelihoods for all people and stressed the importance of open markets and fair and transparent practices to allow trade to flourish. Washington has been keen to expand business and security ties with India, which it sees as a key counterbalance to an increasingly assertive China in Asia. Obama has backed New Delhi's bid to become a permanent member of the U.N. Security Council. However, the relationship has failed to live up to his declaration in 2010 that it would become 'one of the defining partnerships of the 21st Century'. Modi, who came to power in May, has received a warm welcome in the United States, even though he was denied a visa in 2005 over rioting in his home state three years earlier that killed more than 1,000 people, most of them Muslims. Modi denies any wrongdoing and has been exonerated by an Indian Supreme Court investigation. He has maintained a frantic schedule since arriving in America on Friday, even though he is fasting in accordance with Hindu custom. As part of an effort to spur foreign investment, he met more than a dozen U.S. corporate leaders early on Monday and told them he was committed to liberalizing India's economy, which has underperformed other emerging markets recently after years of breakneck growth. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi (right) shakes hands with Ginni Rometty, Chairman and CEO of IBM, during their meeting in New York yesterday . Modi has maintained a frantic schedule since arriving in America on Friday, even though he is fasting in accordance with Hindu custom . On Saturday, Modi addressed the U.N. General Assembly and then appeared before some 60,000 people at a musical event in New York's Central Park aimed at ending global poverty and bringing essentials such as sanitation to all. On Sunday, he received a rapturous welcome from a big crowd of Indian-Americans in an appearance in New York's Madison Square Garden arena. Modi's spokesman, Syed Akbaruddin, said the dinner meeting was 'extremely convivial' and the two leaders found they had a common interest in technology and shared experience in that they were relative political outsiders before coming to power. He said they agreed they 'should focus on some big things they can achieve in a finite time period in the next few years'.

"Finance Minister Mathias Cormann has channelled Arnold Schwarzenegger while trying to fend off budget attacks from Labor, calling the opposition leader an 'economic girlie man'. He said Labor's problem was that 'Bill Shorten is an economic girlie man' - a phrase coined by former California governor Arnold Schwarzenegger at a 2004 Republican convention speech directed at budget pessimists. Labor says it could get the budget back to surplus ahead of the coalition, which is facing difficulty getting several controversial measures through the Senate. Scroll down for video .

The exchange was a response to opposition leader Bill Shortens remark that he could get the budget back to surplus ahead of the coalition . Senator Cormann said Labor had no viable plan to achieve a surplus and challenged the opposition to reveal where it would make cuts and increase revenue. Labor MP Ed Husic lashed out at Senator Cormann, saying he should stop the 'juvenile name-calling' and fix the budget. 'The Terminator should become the Deodoriser and get the stink out of his budget,' he told Sky News. Australian Greens senator Larissa Waters said the term was offensive and accused the minister of being sexist. 'Australian women will be appalled that he has chosen to use gender as a derogatory attack,' Senator Waters said. 'Just more of the same from this sexist, arrogant government.' Cormann later defended his comments to the Daily Telegraph, arguing that the term was gender on specific. 'I am not talking about girls. I am talking about economic girlie men,' he said. 'I don't think there's anything gender specific here. Not girls, girlies, it's very different. I hope you are not going to say I am a sexist misogynist.'

The pair split in November last year - but Miss Oliver then discovered she was pregnant with his child. She claimed he made repeated instructions to her to abort the baby, but she refused. She said: 'I went to see Lindsay and she showed me pictures and messages and everything to prove they were together. 'We found out he had been with us both all along. I found out I was pregnant, and when I told him he told me to I had to go and get an abortion, but I didn't want to. 'He was nice at first saying ""it's not right"", but when I said I couldn't go through with it, he got mad. He said he would kick it kick it out of me if he had to. 'He said I had to get rid of it but when I wouldn't, he said he didn't want anything to do with it.' Champion: Nick Leaning (left) pictured at a recent fight. He denies attempted murder and the trial continues . Miss Oliver said she demanded a DNA test, but Leaning refused. She was 34 weeks pregnant and in the doorway of her home in Belton, North Lincolnshire, when the alleged attack took place. The stabbing led to an emergency caesarean and the premature birth of her baby, who cannot be identified for legal reasons. She said: 'He knew exactly what time I would be back - he knows my routine like clockwork. 'When I got back I unlocked the door and I was just about to open it when I felt someone jumping up on me from behind. Miss Oliver said she was convinced Leaning (pictured) had killed their unborn child . 'I looked down and I clocked the trainers straight away. I knew they were his as we had been in a relationship for 18 months and he lived at my house. 'I felt a stab in my stomach and I tried to push him off. He stabbed me five times. I felt a massive gush of blood between my legs and I thought my baby was dead. Miss Oliver claimed Leaning was wearing a mask he used while training as a cage fighter during the alleged attack, as well as a dark hoodie, blue jeans and a black and red baseball cap. She said: 'He wore all his clothes that he used to wear. I used to wash his clothes when he was working as a chimney sweep. All I could see was his eyes staring at me. 'The first stab took me down. I bent forward and then he pushed me and he was standing over the top of me. 'He was trying to get the knife in as many times as he could. I was shouting ""someone help me please"", and ""Nick please stop it"". 'Eventually he got up and ran away. It's just sick.' Simon Waley, prosecuting, said yesterday: 'When the defendant learned of the pregnancy he had tried to persuade her to have an abortion and when she said she didn't want to, he became angry and said he didn't want to have anything to do with the child. 'He began to indicate to others that the child wasn't his and he hadn't been sleeping with Lauren for some time. 'Lauren and Lindsay had been in touch with each other and had been on friendly terms and arranged a DNA test to determine who was the father. 'He said he would not participate in such a test so Lindsay said she would allow DNA from their child to be used.' He added: 'She was thrown in through the front doorway and fell to the floor. Aftermath: The stabbing led to an emergency caesarean and the premature birth of Miss Oliver's baby . 'She landed on her knees just inside the door and she was pushed onto her back and she curled up into a ball trying to protect her stomach area. 'She could heard grunting as further blows were made to her stomach area. She realised now she was being stabbed. 'She was screaming, shouting his name and begging him to stop. 'He seemed almost to be smiling before stabbing her for the fifth time. He then fled from the scene.' Following the alleged attack, Mr Waley said Lauren got up and tried to follow him before screaming for help. The court heard Lauren was taken to nearby Scunthorpe District Hospital where it was confirmed she had five stab wounds to her abdomen. She underwent emergency surgery and a caesarean section to deliver her baby six weeks early. Mr Waley said 'astonishing that the baby was not harmed'. When giving a description of her attacker to police, the prosecutor said that Lauren told them he was wearing a mask - the type Leaning wore while training as a cage fighter. The court heard that Leaning was arrested around an hour after the incident at his home address in Scunthorpe. Mr Waley said that he gave a number of conflicting accounts as to his whereabouts on the morning, as well as allegedly getting his father to provide him with a false alibi. During police questioning, Leaning finally admitted being at Lauren's property where he said she had shouted at him and 'came at him with a knife'. Mr Waley added: 'It's absurd that a 34-week pregnant Lauren launched an attack on her cage fighter ex-boyfriend and then went on to stab herself and her unborn baby five times in an act of spite against the defendant.' Leaning denies attempted murder, attempted child destruction and wounding with intent. The trial continues.

"Kyle Sinckler grew up a long way from the Twickenham Stoop. Not in geographical terms, but in almost every other sense. Raised by single mum Donna, the football-loving youngster spent his childhood trying to steer clear of the pitfalls that can go with growing up on a tough south London housing estate. The 21-year-old tighthead prop has made a name for himself this season and his reputation is growing beyond the Stoop, his club's home ground. Breaking trough: Kyle Sinckler has played a key role in Harlequins' push for the play-offs . He is quick to praise the part his mother has played in his development and says his background has 'made me the person I am today'. Sinckler explains: 'On the estate there was that sort of (gang-related) environment. But those guys respected me because they knew I was trying to be the best I could be with rugby and I just let them get on with whatever they were doing. 'My mum always taught me to stay clear of trouble and surround myself with positive people. I worked hard, found a love for rugby and did my schoolwork to keep mum happy.' The 19-stone Sinckler will be an integral part of Harlequins' bid to snatch the final Aviva  Premiership play-off place from Bath by beating them at home. Indeed, Sinckler's star is rising so fast . it is not beyond the realms of possibility that if any more of the . England squad suffer injuries he could be on the plane to New Zealand . for the summer tour. Saved: Rugby prevented Sinckler from getting caught up in gang culture when he was younger . Breaking through: Sinckler as an eight-year-old playing for Battersea . 'I'd be . lying if I said I didn't want to play for England,' he said. 'That would . be a massive honour. But my focus is on beating Bath. It's a massive . game.' This . has been a breakthrough season for him. He has not just filled in for . injury victims Paul Doran-Jones and Will Collier, but has excelled in a . position where there are unparalleled physical and technical demands. He has shown the ability to combine his strength — he can repeatedly bench press more than 165kg (26st) — with athleticism and excellent handling skills. He appears destined to play international rugby. But it could all have been very different had Donna, who works at a police call centre, not taken him to local rugby club Battersea Ironsides when he was eight following complaints that her son's approach was too physical for football. No way through: Sinckler stops Paris' Fidjian winger Waisea Nayacalevu Vuidravuwalu in the Amlin Challenge Cup . Saracens have clinched the regular-season title and a home semi-final. Northampton need a point against Wasps to be sure of a home semi-final. Leicester need a bonus point against Saracens to overtake Northampton if they don’t beat Wasps. Winners of Harlequins v Bath get a play-off place. Top six have qualified for the European Cup — Saracens, Northampton, Leicester, Bath, Harlequins, Sale. Seventh-placed Wasps face a two-leg play off against Stade Francais for the last European place. Worcester are relegated. 'I was a football fanatic but I kept being a bit too physical and probably getting sent off here and there,' he explains. 'My mum spoke to one of her friends who said she should take me down to the local rugby club to see if I liked it. I rocked up in my Manchester United shirt, played a game of touch and the rest is history. 'Rugby became a massive outlet for me to get my anger out. If I was angry, instead of doing something I shouldn't do I could go along to Battersea on a Sunday and do something within the laws. At the end we'd shake hands. There were no grudges.' Conor O'Shea, Quins' director of rugby, is certain Sinckler is one for the future, saying: 'You can't survive as a 21-year-old prop in the Premiership without an edge. Kyle has a lot of footballing ability and he's also got that edge. I like that. His potential is very high.' On Saturday, Sinckler will be up against Bath's Welsh international Paul James with current England tight-head Dave Wilson on the other side. He is ready for the challenge. 'I hope they do come at me and underestimate me and then they can have a nice little surprise,' said Sinckler. 'I'm sure I'll get taught a few  lessons but that's what I want. I want to be playing against guys like Paul James and Davey Wilson instead of sitting at home watching it on TV. I want to be in the thick of it. 'You're a person of your environment. I'm glad that I'm where I am but I love where I came from. I'm a south London boy at heart.'","How Sinckler went from inner city to Quins star .

"Gareth Bale marked his return to the Real Madrid starting line-up by scoring after just nine minutes in a convincing 5-1 win over Rayo Vallecano that gave Carlo Ancelotti’s team their 13th straight victory. The Welshman, who also hit the crossbar in the second half, has seen Madrid win their last seven games as he recovered from a Gluteus injury and some supporters have made no secret of the desire to seem the team left unchanged but he came in for Isco on Saturday night at the Santiago Bernabeu and helped Real to yet another comfortable win. Cristiano Ronaldo played Toni Kroos in behind the Rayo Vallecano defence and the German midfielder crossed from the left for Bale to swoop at the back post and convert the centre for the opener. Host commentator . A clinical display by Real Madrid restores them to the top of La Liga with 27 points from 11 points - two clear of their eternal rivals Barcelona. Ancelotti's side have now won 13 games in a row, scoring 52 goals and it is the fifth time they've netted five or more strikes in their last eight league matches. Meanwhile Ronaldo has 18 goals in 10 league appearances this season.That's all from me for tonight, but Sportsmail will be back soon with more top level football action. The referee blows full-time on proceedings and Real record their ninth successive win in La Liga in convincing manner. 91 mins: Quini is booked for a mistimed challenge on Ramos. 90 mins: Medran nearly makes it six but sees his shot saved by Alvarez. 85 mins: And with that goal Carlo Ancelotti makes his final changes of the match as Benzema and Bale are replaced by Alvaro Medran and Javier Hernandez. After making a brilliant save, Alvarez will want to forget this goal. Real pour forward with Ronaldo being found inside Rayo's penalty area from Isco's pass. The Portugal star cuts inside on his right foot before hitting a tame shot that goes through the grasp of Alvarez and into the net for his 23rd goal of the season in all competitions. 79 mins: Fantastic save by Alvarez once more. A long punt up field is headed away by the Rayo defence but only into the path of Bale. The Welsh wizard takes one touch before unleashing a swerving 25-yard left-footed strike that Alvarez does well to tip onto the crossbar. Navas is trying too hard perhaps, knowing this is a rare chance to impress as he comes for a cross that he was never going to get on the end of. Real get away with it though and are still in total control. 74 mins: Navas has been shaky at times in goal for Real tonight and he nearly lets Rayo score once. The ball is whipped into the box and the goalkeeper comes rushing out to punch, but is beaten to the ball by Abdoulaye Ba who's header just goes past the post. A let off for the hosts. 73 mins: Rayo make their third and final change. Baptistao comes off for Manucho in a like-for-like swap. 70 mins: Well what can you say about Real? They've had less possession (45-55) than their opponents but are devastating when in attack. Ronaldo nearly makes it 5-1 bar a great save from Alvarez. With 20 minutes remaining more goals certainly look to be on the cards. 68 mins: Rodriguez comes off for Isco. One playmaker for another to add to Rayo's woes. 61 mins: Rayo make their second change of the night with Roberto Trashorras replaced by Jozabed. The game looks done and dusted now. Pepe marches forward with the ball and finds Ronaldo on the right hand side of the Rayo penalty area. The 29-year-old drills the ball across goal and Benzema bundles it home. Replays show that the France international was offside though. Tito is booked for a nasty challenge on Bale in the build-up to the goal. What a beautiful strike by Kroos. Ronaldo weaves his way into the Rayo box before toe poking the ball back on the edge of the area to Kroos. The German international caresses the ball into the bottom corner of the net from 20 yards for a sumptuous goal. Just 10 seconds earlier it could have been 2-2. Baptistao finishes neatly past Navas but is marginally offside. The outlook of this match could have been so different... 54 mins: The one criticism of Luka Modric is that he doesn't score enough goals and that is evident once more as Real attack. Bale's intended pass for Nacho finds Modric inside the Rayo box but he curls his right-footed effort past the post. 52 mins: Over five minutes into the second half and both sides have failed to trouble each other so far... We're back underway at the Santiago Bernabeu... Real came close to scoring a third before half-time when Gareth Bale's free kick just clears Alvarez's crossbar. As it is though it's 2-1 at the break. Ancelotti will be furious with the way his side conceded their goal - a strike that will give Rayo some belief after the interval. Or is it? Terrible defending by Real Madrid to let Rayo back in the match. Navas throws the ball out to Rodriguez. Turning into danger the Colombia international inexplicably tries to play a pass back to the goalkeeper but it intercepted by Rayo. Bueno rounds Navas before tapping into an empty net. And now it is. Bale sees his cross cleared behind for a corner. Rodriguez's set piece is whipped into the box and Sergio Ramos meets it with glancing volley that appears to come off his shin and loop into the net. That's his 50th goal of the club and a long way back for Rayo. 38 mins: Great save by Alvarez! Rodriguez collects the ball from 30 yards out and runs at the Rayo defence before unleashing a blistering left-footed drive that is brilliantly stopped by Alvarez for a corner. From the resulting set piece Benzema hits the top of the crossbar with a header. So nearly 2-0 for Ancelotti's side. 35 mins: Bit of magic from Bale. Having already scored, he collects the ball on the halfway line and turns his marker before running at the Rayo defence. Unfortunately for the hosts though he over hits his pass intended for Ronaldo. 33 mins: The game has started to settle down after a fast start following Bale's goal. Rayo have come into the match more as the game has grown but Real look dangerous every time they attack. 26 mins: Rayo boss Paco is already forced to make a substitute at 1-0 down as left-back Insua pulls a muscle and is replaced by Quini. 23 mins: As Rayo show some fight, Real hit them on the break with Ronaldo bursting clear. The Portugal star is stopped in his tracks unceremoniously by Rayo midfielder Mohammed Fatau and no foul is given - to the annoyance of the home supporters. On second evidence it should have been a free-kick and a yellow card to Fatau as Emiliano Insua was there to cover. 21 mins: Rayo are starting to show some fight. Leo Baptistao and Bueno both test Navas. 18 mins: It's wave after wave of Real pressure at the moment. It's early days but Carlo Ancelotti's side are playing brilliantly. Karim Benzema and James Rodriguez link up neatly before finding Ronaldo inside the box. However, the 29-year-old blazes over a great opportunity over the bar with his left foot. It didn't take long did it. Ronaldo slips in a pass to Toni Kroos who whips in a low cross for Bale to tap into an empty net from close range. Things are already looking ominous for the visitors. Rayo fans making plenty of noise; they have not had far to travel... Rayo a club club from the Vallecas neighbourhood of Madrid. 6 mins: Real's confidence is oozing following their amazing run of 12 successive wins and it's showing following the opening stages of the match. Navas hasn't had to make a save yet as Real are starting to build some momentum. 2 mins: We have our first shot of the match and who else has it? Yes that man Ronaldo cuts in from the left and hits a dipping right-footed effort that is saved by Cristian Dario Alvarez. The hosts get the game underway... All the facts point in favour of a Real Madrid win. They've scored 37 goals in La Liga so far, sit top of the division and have won their last 12 games in all competitions. Can Rayo stop the Spanish giants juggernaut? What can more you say about Cristiano Ronaldo. The Portugal superstar has scored 22 goals in all competitions and will be hungry to add to his tally against a Vallecano side who conceded 28 goals in their last nine visits to the Bernabeu. Half a chance for Rayo tonight as Real Madrid play with their second keeper. Shame it's Keylor Navas who made more saves than anyone else in La Liga last season. As boss Carlo Ancelotti guaranteed in the build-up to the match, Gareth Bale starts for the Spanish giants. The Wales international had missed the club's previous five games due to a muscle injury, before coming on as a substitute in their 1-0 win against Liverpool in the Champions League on Tuesday.Real Madrid XI: Navas, Nacho, Pepe, Ramos, Marcelo, Kroos, Modric, Bale, Rodriguez, Ronaldo, Benzema.

"Accused: Sanford Rubenstein allegedly raped a 42-year-old official at the National Action Network after coming home from Rev Al Sharpton's birthday party . The woman who was allegedly raped by a top civil rights lawyer after meeting him at Rev. Al Sharpton's star-studded 60th birthday party had consensual sex with him the morning after, sources claim. The alleged victim, a 42-year-old who works for Sharpton's National Action Network, went home with Sanford Rubenstein, 70, after the celebration last week. She was then allegedly raped by the high-powered lawyer. Investigators suspect he may even have used an object to penetrate her during the alleged attack in his Manhattan penthouse, sources told the New York Daily News. The anonymous accusation, which emerged yesterday, is at odds with the source close to Rubenstein, who said the alleged attack that night was in fact consensual, and that more sex followed the next morning. The claims, reported yesterday, come as investigators spent hours searching Rubenstein's apartment on Manhattan's Upper East Side today for evidence. He has not been charged with anything, though law enforcement  sources suggested to the paper that are considering a third-degree rape charge, which means the victim was incapable of consent. Rubenstein is a well-known society figure in New York and has fought high-profile cases linked to the National Action Network, often over the actions of the NYPD. Sharpton also found himself drawn into commenting on the accusations today, telling a crowd: 'I don't care how close we are - if he's wrong, he's wrong.' Although he avoided choosing one side over the other, Sharpton said there is 'no place' for the alleged behavior, the New York Post reported. Evidence: An NYPD officer carries out a bag of material from Rubenstein's Upper East Side penthouse apartment . Close: The Rev Al Sharpton, center with Rubenstein to the left, has said there is no place for the alleged behavior - but avoided jumping to the conclusion that he is guilty . He said: 'We do not justify disrespecting women. Doesn’t mean you’re guilty, but it does mean if you are, ain’t no place for that in our community.' Rubenstein and his alleged victim were both at Sharpton's lavish 60th birthday party at the Four Seasons restaurant before they went home together, along with a third person, who later left. Other guests at the bash included New York Mayor Bill de Blasio, New York governor Andrew Cuomo, singer Aretha Franklin and director Spike Lee. A police source described the case as 'a classic he said, she said'. Law enforcement sources also described how Rubenstein was allegedly called by the victim, with police listening in, in an attempt to trick him into describing the encounter. Defense: Benjamin Brafman has been taken on as Rubenstein's attorney. Above he denies all allegations to waiting reporters . But, the source said, the call passed without incident and Rubenstein simply said that they two of them had sex. Rubenstein hit back at the claims today through a lawyer of his own - top New York attorney Benjamin Brafman. Brafman spoke to waiting reporters outside Rubenstein's apartment today denying any wrongdoing. He said: 'We do not believe he committed any crime whatsoever and are confident that when the investigation is completed no criminal charges will be filed'.","Sanford Rubenstein, 70, accused of raping 42-year-old last week .

"Cloud storage site Dropbox has denied claims it has been hacked after an anonymous account posted what it claims are the usernames and passwords of hundreds of the site's users. An anonymous post to website Pastebin - which people use to save text they would like to paste elsewhere later - contained a list of hundreds of email log-ins and passwords the hacker said were linked to Dropbox accounts. In it, they claimed that more than 6.9 million Dropbox account details have been obtained and would be posted. An unfortunate slogan:Cloud storage site Dropbox has denied claims it has been hacked after an anonymous account posted what it claims are the usernames and passwords of hundreds of the site's users . The hacker has asked for donations in digital currency Bitcoin in exchange for revealing the alleged flaws in Dropbox's security - and revealing more account details. 'As more BTC (Bitcoin) is donated, more Pastebin pastes will appear,' the hacker wrote. However, Dropbox has denied that its service has been compromised. Anton Mityagin, of Dropbox, said the hosile move is an attempt to gain money from stolen data found elsewhere online. 'Recent news articles claiming that Dropbox was hacked aren't true. Your stuff is safe,' he said. 'The usernames and passwords referenced in these articles were stolen from unrelated services, not Dropbox. Attackers then used these stolen credentials to try to log in to sites across the internet, including Dropbox. Anonymous attack: An anonymous post to website Pastebin, which is traditionally used to save text users would like to paste elsewhere later, contained a list of hundreds of email log-ins and passwords the hacker claimed were linked to Dropbox accounts. A stock image illustrating a n anonymous cyber criminal is pictured . Images of more than 80 stars including Oscar winner Jennifer Lawrence,  Rihanna and  Kim Kardashian were stolen and posted online a month ago by mystery hackers. Ms Lawrence, 24, has said it is a crime and sexual violation. Photos of Lawrence, model Kate Upton, actress Kirsten Dunst and other women had apparently been hacked from individual iCloud accounts and were uploaded to the image-sharing forum 4chan. The FBI has been investigating the matter, while Apple admitted that certain celebrity accounts had been compromised. But the company said none of the cases it had investigated were due to any breach in Apple's systems including iCloud or Find My iPhone. The European Union's new digital head accused celebrities whose naked photos have been leaked online of being 'dumb' for having taken them in the first place. Gunther Oettinger, who will become the European Commissioner for digital economy and society next month, said: ‘If someone is dumb enough as a celebrity to take a nude photo of themselves and put it online, they surely can't expect us to protect them.’ He later added: ‘Everybody has a right to privacy.The EU Commission wants to make cloud computing safer,' but did not apologise for his earlier comments. Google is being threatened with a £60 million lawsuit from female celebrities for allegedly profiting from the biggest nude photo-hacking scandal in history. The search giant has been accused of failing to remove the private images and ‘making millions from the victimisation of women’, according to a legal letter obtained by The New York Post. 'We have measures in place to detect suspicious login activity and we automatically reset passwords when it happens.' Mr Mityagin went on to encourage users to increase the security on their Dropbox account, citing this attack as a good reason to turn on two-step verification. This adds a second layer of security to an account and is used by many other online services. In this instance it requires an additional code entry that is sent to a user's phone when they try to log in, as well as the password. 'The idea behind two-step verification is to combine ""something you know"", like your password, with ""something you have"", like your phone to add an extra layer of security,' said Dropbox's Cory Louie. This attack marks the latest incident in a growing line of hacks on major websites and services as hackers look to mine personal data. The celebrity nude photo hack, as well as breaches to eBay and photo-messaging app Snapchat have attracted considerable attention this year. Some industry experts have been less dismissive of the attack than Dropbox. Tony Pepper, CEO of online security platform Egress has warned consumers and businesses are risking themselves through what he calls 'bad habits'. 'Another day, another example of why people should not trust insecure online collaboration platforms, such as Dropbox. It is not just personal information that is at risk but commercially sensitive data as well,' he said. 'As IT becomes increasingly consumerised, people are not only bringing their own devices to work, they are bringing their bad habits too. How often have you been communicating with a colleague or partner and needed to share a large file, and the easiest option has been to simply send it via Dropbox? It is becoming common practice. 'Incidents such as these highlight the risk to data security that this creates and should act as a wake-up call for organisations to start looking at the processes within their business.' Financially motived: The hacker asked for donations in Bitcoin (pictured) in exchange for revealing the alleged flaws in Dropbox's security, as well as revealing more account details . Mark Sparshott from security firm Proofpoint explained that is the casual nature of some users when it comes to passwords that places them at risk to attacks like this. 'Cybercriminals were able to simply log in to Dropbox accounts using the usernames and passwords they hacked or purchased elsewhere on the internet. Cybercriminals know that many consumers are not aware of security best practice, or choose to ignore it, by using the same ID/email address and password to login to multiple online services,' he said. 'This password reuse is exacerbated by the increasing volume and success rates cybercriminals are enjoying with advanced phishing campaigns such as longlining, many of which are ""Credential Attacks"" where the phish email sends the recipient to a fake website resembling the login page of a legitimate online service, often Amazon, Dropbox and Google Docs.' However Dropbox is maintaining that on this occasion the attack has not affected their service. 'A subsequent list of usernames and passwords has been posted online. We've checked and these are not associated with Dropbox accounts,' the cloud firm said.","Anonymous post to website Pastebin, traditionally used to save text users would like to paste elsewhere later, contained a list of of email log-ins .

"China is considering building an 8,000-mile high-speed rail link to America that would take less than two days to travel. Travelling at around 217mph, the train would leave the north east of the country, run through Siberia and enter a 125-mile tunnel under the Bering Strait, the shortest crossing between Russia and Alaska. It would then resurface and head south through Canada, before reaching its destination in the US. Ambitious plans: The 8,000-mile high-speed link would begin in north east China and end up in the US . It is unclear whether the American, Canadian or Russian governments have agreed to the proposals. But engineers claim it would provide a viable alternative to air travel, according to China Daily. If completed, it would be 2,300 miles longer than the Trans-Siberian Railway, making it the longest train route in the world. The underwater passage would also be four times the length of the Channel Tunnel, which connects France and the United Kingdom. Even though the plans haven not been finalised, it is believed the project would be developed and financed by the Chinese, who have become global leaders in high-speed rail travel.

Kasey Nesbitt, 35, made his first court appearance in a Wichita courtroom Wednesday and was charged with rape and aggravated burglary. The woman, who lives alone, told police that intruders forced open the door of her home on September 29 while she was asleep. Scroll down for video . Shocking case: Kasey Nesbitt, 35, has been charged with rape and aggravated burglary in connection to the September 29 attack on a 100-year-old Wichita woman . Break-in: Police say Nesbitt and several accomplices forced their way into the victim's home in the 800 block of South Crestway in Wichita . The victim, who is not being named due to the nature of the crime, said the men were in her home for several hours. According to police, forensic evidence linked Nesbitt to the rape. He is being held in the Sedgwick County Jail on $250,000 bond. Life of crime: Nesbitt, a documented criminal, has a rap sheet going back to 2000, which mostly includes burglary and theft convictions . The suspect, a documented gang member, has a lengthy criminal record going back to 2000, which includes multiple convictions on burglary and theft charges. Court records obtained by The Wichita Eagle showed that he was released from prison in January 2013. Nesbitt was arrested Monday in connection to an unrelated burglary and was already in jail when he was named a suspect in the rape case.

At around 7am the following day, the alleged rape victim walked to a neighbor's home for help. The elderly resident said that she was awakened at around 9pm by strangers, who forced their way inside through the back door. A medical examination determined that the woman had been sexually violated. Wichita Police Captain Troy Livingston said that the victim is 'a very strong and brave woman' who was able to give them information on the suspects. . Nesbitt is due back in court October 29. The station KWCH reported that if convicted, prosecutors plan to ask for a harsher sentence for Nesbitt because the victim was particularly vulnerable. 'All rape is a deplorable crime, but when you look at the age of our victim it becomes a little bit more concerning and a little bit more disturbing,' Livingston said.","Kasey Nesbitt charged with rape and aggravated burglary in the September 29 home invasion in Wichita, Kansas .

"Pizza Express is serving halal chicken to its unwitting customers on the quiet, with staff only telling customers about the meat if asked. Only meat from birds that have had their throats slit while still alive, in accordance with Islamic traditions, is used in dishes. The menu makes no mention of the issue and customers can find out only by checking the small print on the Pizza Express website – or by asking staff explicitly. Slice: Pizza Express has revealed all of the chicken it uses is halal, meaning it is prepared in accordance with Islamic traditions. A file image of the Leggera Pollo ad Astra on its menu is pictured . Eating in: The issue is not mentioned on the restaurants' menus and customers can only find out if they check the chain's website or ask staff . The firm, which has 434 restaurants across the UK, states on its website: ‘All our chicken is halal approved but it is important to note that all birds are stunned before being slaughtered. ‘Our chicken supplier is accredited by the British Retail  Consortium. This means it meets the global standard for food safety and legality.’ A spokesman said: ‘Our chicken is halal approved. We serve halal chicken in all of our UK restaurants. Pizza Express is committed to animal welfare standards. ‘As such birds are stunned before being slaughtered. We are very happy to provide this information to our guests. ‘We spend a lot of time listening to our guests and do our best to cater to their needs. Whether this means creating vegan-friendly pizzas or serving halal chicken, we take their feedback seriously.’ The revelation has angered campaigners. Stephen Evans, of the National Secular Society, told The Sun: ‘Unsuspecting members of the public are routinely being duped into buying meat from religious slaughter methods. Food industry experts say the move may have come about because non-Muslim customers are less likely to complain . The chain says chickens used in their food are stunned before they are slaughtered . ‘Meat should be properly labelled, enabling consumers to make an informed choice about the food they’re buying.’ The halal meat market in the UK is worth around £2.6billion a year – and it is expected to soar. 'Keeping halal and non-halal meat is expensive and creates the risk of non-halal being fed to Muslims, which shops and restaurants know will cause uproar. Maybe they think non-Muslims are less likely to complain' Richard North, meat inspector . Meat inspector Richard North said chains such as Pizza Express served halal chicken to save money. He added: ‘Keeping halal and non-halal meat is expensive and creates the risk of non-halal being fed to Muslims, which shops and restaurants know will cause uproar. Maybe they think non-Muslims are less likely to complain.’ Last week . it was revealed that Subway has removed ham and bacon from almost 200 . fast food outlets and switched to halal meat alternatives in an attempt . to please its Muslim customers. Turkey ‘ham’ and turkey rashers will be . used instead in 185 of its stores, where all the meat will now be . prepared according to halal rules. The chain, . which has around 1,500 outlets across the UK, explained its decision by . saying it had to balance animal welfare concerns with ‘the views of . religious communities’. Graphic: Last month, undercover investigators secretly filmed inside a . halal abattoir near Banham, Norfolk, as more than 100 sheep appeared to . writhe in agony after being ritually killed . Shocking: The sheep at the Simply Halal abattoir in Banham were still fighting for their lives, even after having their throats cut, before being strung up . Traditional halal slaughter has animals having their throats slit before bleeding to death. In Arabic the word halal means ‘permitted’ or ‘lawful’ and defines anything that is allowed or lawful according to the Koran. Restaurant chain: The company says all its food meets global standards for safety and legality . It is often used to indicate food – particularly meat – that has been prepared in accordance with Muslim principles and techniques. In Britain, killing an animal without prior stunning is illegal, but the law gives special exemption to Muslim and Jewish meat producers on the grounds of religion. In the UK there are thought to be around 12 abattoirs dedicated to unstunned slaughter, while hundreds practise stunned halal slaughter. Muslims are forbidden from eating any non-halal food and meat from pigs and Subway said customers can identify those stores selling halal food by the special ‘All meats are Halal’ sign, which must be displayed in participating branches. A People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals spokesman told MailOnline: ‘Peta fights to help all animals who are slaughtered for their flesh, and we do not particularly differentiate between killing methods in our vegan campaigns. ‘However, as long as animals are still killed for food, banning the most inhumane slaughter methods – in which cows and other animals have their throats cut while they're still conscious – is a step in the right direction.’ But he added: ‘No religion needs to slaughter animals for food, so the kindest thing that we can do for all animals is to leave them off our plates by adopting a vegan diet.’ Halal . refers to any object or action which is 'permissible' according to . Islamic law. The term covers not only food and drink but also matters of . daily life. Halal . foods are those that Muslims are allowed to eat or drink under Islamic . Shari'ah. The criteria dictates both food which are allowed and how the . food must be prepared. The foods most commonly addressed are types of . meat and animal tissue. The . most common example of non-halal, or forbidden food is pork. It is the . only meat that must not be eaten by Muslims at all, due to historical, . cultural and religiously perceived hygienic concerns. 'Permitted': Halal foods are those that Muslims are allowed to eat or drink under Islamic Shari'ah . Other meats can be forbidden, depending on their source, the cause of the animal's death and how it was processed. To . be halal, the food must have come from a supplier that uses halal . practises. Meat: A sign for halal, which means 'permitted' Specifically the slaughter must be performed by a Muslim, who . must invoke the name of Allah prior to killing the animal. Commonly a . person will say 'Bismillah' ('In the name of God') before repeating . 'Allahu akbar' ('God is the greatest') three times. The . animal is then slaughtered with a sharp knife, by cutting the throat, . windpipe and blood vessels in the neck without cutting the spinal cord. The blood must then be drained from its veins. Traditionally and according to Islamic scholars, an animal must be conscious while slaughtered. However the majority of halal abattoirs stun the animals before killing them. Muslims . must also ensure that all foods, particularly processed foods, as well . as non-food items like cosmetics and pharmaceuticals, are halal. The opposite of halal is 'haraam', meaning forbidden. NANDO’S . Nando's serves Halal chicken at 64 restaurants in Britain - which is around a fifth of its outlets. It says Halal chicken is served ‘in restaurants where local demand for that particular product is high, combined with various other business factors’. Nando’s Halal chickens are supplied by Freemans of Newent in Gloucestershire, with all of the animals indoor-reared and given a high frequency low voltage stun. This means that when chicken is hand slaughtered and blessed, it is still alive but unconscious. Restaurants serving Halal chicken are marked with a sign on the entrance of the restaurant and on its website. KFC . Some 96 of Kentucky Fried Chicken's UK stores are running a trial with halal chicken - accounting for around an eighth of the total. The chain says its suppliers use a pain-free technique called 'stun-to-stun' before slaughter, which means the animal cannot feel pain. All non-halal products have been removed from the halal trial stores - including pork and bacon. SUBWAY . Last week it was revealed that Subway had removed ham and bacon from almost 200 outlets, and switched to halal meat alternatives. It has confirmed turkey ham and turkey rashers will be used instead in 185 of its stores, where all the meat will now be prepared according to halal rules. The chain, which has around 1,500 outlets across the UK, said it had to balance animal welfare concerns with 'the views of religious communities'. BURGER KING . Burger King confirmed yesterday that none of its meat is halal. A spokesman told MailOnline: ‘The beef burgers served at the Burger King restaurants in the UK and Ireland are made of 100 per cent British and Irish beef, which is not slaughtered in a halal or kosher manner.’ MCDONALD'S . McDonald’s also confirmed to MailOnline yesterday that none of . the meat supplied to the chain is certified as halal. A spokesman said: ‘McDonald’s has a rigorous set of . standards governing animal welfare practices and the quality, hygiene, safety . and traceability of our food. ‘These standards include the mandatory stunning of all . animals prior to slaughter and do not include any references to Halal . requirements in the UK.’ The Mail on Sunday has previously revealed that halal meat from animals who had been stunned before slaughter was being sold in schools, hospitals, pubs and at famous sporting venues such as Ascot and Twickenham. All the beef, chicken and lamb sold to fans at Wembley was secretly prepared in accordance with Islamic law, while Cheltenham College was one of several top public schools which also served halal chicken to pupils without informing them. A Marks & Spencer spokesman said on Twitter last night that the chain does not sell halal products.","All chicken used in chain's food is prepared according to Islamic traditions .

"Former Chelsea manager John Neal has died, with the London club paying tribute to him as the man who helped to keep the club afloat. Neal passed away on Sunday at the age of 82, after a long career in football which took in Hull, Swindon, Aston Villa and Southampton as a player and Wrexham, Middlesbrough and Chelsea as a manager. 'Chelsea Football Club is deeply saddened by the passing of John Neal, one of the most significant and loved managers in our history,' the club confirmed. John Neal, the former Chelsea manager who died on Sunday at the age of 82, is pictured in retirement . Appointed by Chelsea in 1981 as successor to Geoff Hurst, Neal prevented the Blues from slipping into the Third Division and in 1984 guided them to the Second Division title. He had to stand down in 1985 due to heart surgery and was appointed to the club's board of directors. He never managed again, but Chelsea still fondly remember his efforts. As part of a long tribute on their website, the Barclays Premier League leaders said: 'To this day those years when the team that John built flourished remain among the very favourite Chelsea seasons for fans who lived through them. 'It is no exaggeration to suggest there might not be a Chelsea Football Club today had he not made such a success of dealing with crisis and getting the team back on its feet.' Neal took over Chelsea at a time when financial problems were crippling the club, but the manager's eye for a bargain - notably the small-fee signings of Kerry Dixon and Pat Nevin - helped get the club back on track both on and off the field. Prior to being at Chelsea, Neal had made a huge impression at Wrexham. Appointed in 1968, he twice took them into the European Cup Winners' Cup owing to their Welsh Cup successes, with brave defeats to Hajduk Split and Anderlecht ending their runs. Kerry Dixon, who was signed by Neal, celebrates scoring in a Chelsea victory against Watford in 1984 . Pat Nevin was also brought to Chelsea by Neal and went on to become a club legend . He spent four years with Middlesbrough after replacing Jack Charlton in 1977, before the start of his Blues spell. Club historian Rick Glanvill wrote: 'A succession of novices had found turning round London's cash-strapped former giant beyond them before Neal arrived in 1981. 'After a dismal two seasons, his proper old football nous would produce two years of unforgettable drama and togetherness in the middle of a troubled decade and a half. 'Had his reign not been cruelly curtailed by illness, genuine silverware looked highly possible.'

"A teenager took an exam despite having been stabbed through the thigh with a screwdriver in a racist attack, it has been revealed. Bradley Halton, 18, was attacked by a group of four or five Asian men as he walked to his exam at Barking & Dagenham College in East London. The group shouted racist abuse at him, and one man grabbed his throat before another threw an arm around his waist and bundled him to the ground. Bradley Halton, 18, a trainee decorator, sat an exam at Barking and Dagenham College in East London despite suffering four stab wounds which he had plugged with tissue paper . The group then punched and kicked Mr Halton before one man stabbed him four times in the back of his right thigh with a screwdriver. Despite his wounds Mr Halton carried on walking to his exam, plugged his wounds up with tissue paper, and then sat the test without telling examiners. Mr Halton was punched, kicked and stabbed with a screwdriver by four Asian men in a racist attack . One of his friends said: 'He must be the most dedicated exam candidate. He told us the pain got worse the longer he spent on the exam, but nothing would stop him completing it.' It was only after the test finished that Mr Halton, a trainee decorator, called his girlfriend to say the pain had become unbearable, at which point she dialled 999. An ambulance took Mr Halton, from Dagenham, to the Royal London Hospital in Whitechapel where doctor's gave him an x-ray and stitches before calling his mother. Donna, 41, feared her son was dead when she first heard the news. She said: 'I was thinking he was lying in a gutter somewhere. 'But he just carried on and went to college to sit the exam after getting some tissues to put in the holes in his leg.' Mr Halton is in the second year of his vocational course at college, and returned to school for the first time yesterday after the attack. A Met Police spokesman said: 'At 2.45pm on September 16, police were called by the ambulance to the home of an 18-year-old man from Dagenham who had suffered a stab wound to his leg. 'The victim alleged that he was attacked from behind by a group of Asian males at 9am that morning. He was punched and kicked to the ground and stabbed in the thigh. 'This appears to have been a motiveless attack. No property was stolen.' Anyone with information should contact Barking and Dagenham CID by dialling 101 or call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 quoting reference 5115029/14. He was only taken to hospital after finishing his exam at this college, when he called his girlfriend to complain about the pain, at which point she called an ambulance .","Bradley Halton, 18, walking to exam at Barking & Dagenham College, London .

"A council is to include the title 'Mx' on its official forms to be more accommodating to the trans-community. Campaigners say that 'Mx', short for 'Mixter', is a gender neutral alternative to Mr, Mrs, Ms and Miss. Brighton and Hove city council's trans-equality panel previously pointed out that the gender part of forms allows people to say if they are male, female or other. It said the lack of options in the title field does not provide for people who do not identify as male or female. Brighton and Hove city council is to offer 'Mx' as a title option on official forms following a review of services for trans people . Yesterday the council's policy and . resources committee approved a series of measures, including the removal of the need for patients to choose from male or female options when they check in at electronic screens on arrival at a GP surgery. Other recommendations include ensuring . all councillors and police staff undertake trans awareness training and . introducing gender neutral toilets and changing rooms, suggested by the council's trans-equality scrutiny panel. Brighton has a gay, lesbian, bisexual and trans population of about 40,000. The recommendations will now be passed on to the full council. Ruth Rose, 79, of Newhaven, Sussex, who was born male, said: 'It can be difficult in GP surgeries - I am not recognised. 'If I put in female I am not found if I put in male - which I am not - I am not found. 'You have to decide between one sex or the other depending on what stage of your transition you are at. 'And in some situations, for example, when you are getting your bins collected, does it matter if you are male or female?' The recommendation follows the suggestions from Brighton and Hove city council to introduce gender neutral toilets and send councillors and police to trans awareness training . The report noted: 'The Trans Equality Scrutiny Panel was ground-breaking, being the first in the country to carry out, in a sensitive and effective way, a detailed investigation into the experiences and needs of trans individuals and community in the city. 'It provides a firm and clear foundation for all public services to build on in terms of improving their understanding of and service provision to the trans community. 'For example, during the panel process housing officers committed to commissioning trans awareness training and city services committed looking at the introducing more flexibility on honorific titles (such as Mr, Ms) within online forms.' The clinical commissioning group made up of GPs across the county said it would implement the changes. Green Party councillor Phelim MacCafferty, chairman of the trans-equality and scrutiny panel which was set up in May 2012, said: 'Our transgender community is one of the most disadvantaged and marginalised groups in Brighton and Hove. 'There has been inadequate awareness of lives of trans people for too long. 'The recommendations of our cross party panel will make the city a fairer place for trans people to live, work, study or visit here.' A clinical commissioning group spokesman said: 'We support the recommendations.'","'Mx', short for 'Mixter', is a gender neutral title .

"Actress Lynda Bellingham today defended her decision to stop chemotherapy, insisting she had not 'chosen to die' Lynda Bellingham says she has not 'chosen to die', despite the fact she plans to stop having chemotherapy for bowel cancer. The 66-year-old actress has spoken at length in the past fortnight about her diagnosis and treatment, since announcing her condition was terminal. Today she said she had taken the decision about chemotherapy while at her wit's end with the pain and side effects of the treatment - and had wanted to get some control back over her life. Appearing on ITV's This Morning, she said: 'I haven't decided to die at all, no. 'I just sat down when I was in pain - there's no getting away from it with chemo - the ulcers in your throat, the thrush, plus the fact I'd had major, life-saving surgery for a perforated colon. 'When you're in terrible pain, you make decisions.' She told hosts Phillip Schofield and Amanda Holden: 'I want my husband and children to see me off happy, contented. 'So I put the chemotherapy in a box. 'In this box, I could stop the chemotherapy after Christmas - I'm determined to hang on until Christmas. 'If my quality of life fades after that, I want to be able to open the box, make a choice and stop the chemotherapy.' She said before this, she'd had no control over the decision - but had struggled with the idea of refusing treatment offered. 'I don't want to look ungrateful,' she explained. 'The box [decision] is there to be used if I need it. 'If my quality of life remains as it is now [after Christmas], then why would I hasten my death? ' Yesterday, appearing on BBC Breakfast, she explained she had the option to resume treatment if her health improves. 'It's there on the table if I want it,' she said. Lynda also admitted today there were times when she lay awake wondering about the future. Speaking about her new book, There's Something I've Been Dying To Tell you, she said: 'The book is for everyone - every single day people are going through this. 'As my oncologist says, the smallest cancer cell can outwit the brightest oncologist. Scroll down for video . Lynda told This Morning hosts Phillip Schofield and Amanda Holden she had taken the decision to stop chemotherapy when she was in pain. 'There's no getting away from it with chemo - the ulcers in your throat, the thrush, plus the fact I'd had major, life-saving surgery for a perforated colon,' she said . Lynda, with husband Michael outside the ITV studios today, said the positive thing about having a long-term condition such as cancer meant she'd had time to talk and spend time with her family . 'It's not a book going ""oooh, I've for cancer"". It's positive - grasp what people give you and turn everything around to be positive.' For example, she added that having a long-term condition such as cancer had at least given her time to talk and enjoy time with her family, as well as make plans. 'To lose someone suddenly must be devastating - that is worse,' she said. 'My family and I have had lots of chats, time to talk - you realise sometimes when you are a parent you don't ever really talk to your children.' She said the topic of death had also been discussed. 'As a society, we never talk about it, we never face it - even though it's everywhere. We must talk about death. Sit down, get your wills out the way. Lynda is now trying to get more people to talk about 'unsexy' conditions such as bowel cancer, and even joked about emptying her colostomy bag at Buckingham Palace after collecting her OBE . 'People spend their last few months worrying about death, but not pinpointing [what it is about death] they are worried about - rather than focusing on everything they've got.' The prognosis, she said, had made her more vocal and empowered. 'I'm able to tell people what I really think,' she laughed. She is also on a mission to speak about the unspeakable - bowel habits and bowel cancer - to sweep way the embarrassment surrounding the condition that often costs lives. 'Bowel cancer and bottoms aren't sexy,' she said. To prove a point, she even divulged details of her trip to the loo at Buckingham Palace when collecting her OBE. 'When I visited the Royal toilet, I took my cream suede shoes off just in case.' This was to protect them while emptied her colostomy bag - nicknamed Furby, which, she added, makes a 'tweeting noise- rather than a raspberry noise'. 'These things mustn't be embarrassing - they are part of life,' Lynda added. 'For me, if two of three people read this and feel less alone, then I'm happy.' When praised about her openness and honesty in discussing her cancer, she joked: 'After five years on Loose Women [the chat show where she was a panellist], everything knows everything about you anyway. 'People should be able to trust you. God forbid I don't die for another couple of years [after all this]!' She added the response to her speaking out about her diagnosis had been 'overwhelming'. 'It keeps an old girl going,' she joked. 'Lots of people want you to console them, which is interesting, and you think ""shouldn't it be the other way round""? When asked if she was bitter about her diagnosis, she simply said: 'Don't go there. 'There is no point. I was stage four from day one, and people have been so kind. 'Instead, I want to be happy and talk.' Chemotherapy treatment causes side effects because it kills some normal cells as well as cancer cells . Chemotherapy causes side effects because drugs that kill dividing cancer cells, also kill other normal cells in the body that divide too. These include cells in the skin, hair and nails. The mouth, the lining of the digestive system and bone marrow are also affected. Common side-effects of chemotherapy include: . Tiredness . Treatment can cause tiredness, lethargy and fatigue which may last for quite a few months after the treatment ends. Sickness . Many chemotherapy drugs cause nausea or vomiting, but this can usually be controlled with anti sickness medicines. Mouth ulcers . Some drugs can make the lining of the mouth sore and cause mouth ulcers . Diarrhoea or constipation . This usually happens in the first few days after treatment. Increased risk of infection . Chemotherapy drugs stops the bone marrow from making enough blood cells which leaves a person more at risk of catching infections that can be quite serious. Hair, skin and nails . Chemotherapy treatment can make hair fall out, make your skin dry, sensitive and prone to rashes. Some people find their nails become dry, ridged and brittle. Nerves . Numbness in the hands and feet, which sometimes feels like pins and needles is common because drugs can damage nerves. Sex and fertility . People often feel tired and lose their libido when undergoing chemotherapy. Some drugs also affect fertility.

"Almost 150 criminals have been let out of jail by mistake in the last four years, and at least 24 of them are still on the run. The astonishing admission by ministers sparked claims communities are being put at risk by offenders who should be behind bars. Official figures showing that an inmate is accidentally allowed to walk free almost every week were branded an 'insult' to victims of crime. Bungles in prisons across the country see on average one inmate let out by mistake almost every week . Since May 2010 when the coalition was formed on promise to deliver a tougher law and order agenda, 148 criminals have been released in error from jails in England and Wales. Most are caused by bungled paperwork but some are linked to errors in the lengthy of time inmates are supposed to be held behind bars. Ministers insist most of those let out in error are quickly picked up again. But new figures show at least 24 people who should be in prison are on the run after prison staff showed them the door. It includes at least three women from closed prisons and 13 category C prisoners. The figures were released by the Ministry of Justice in a series of responses to parliamentary questions by Labour. Labour's shadow justice secretary Sadiq Khan said communities were being put at risk by criminals who should be behind bars . Shadow justice secretary Sadiq Khan said: 'Each week brings more evidence showing David Cameron's justice system is in chaos. 'I'm astounded that 148 criminals have been wrongly released from prison on this Government's watch. But to add insult to injury, 24 of them are still on the run. 'Victims will be insulted that criminals are allowed to waltz out of jail so easily, and continue to live their lives scot free. 'Communities are being put at risk by serious and dangerous criminals walking the streets when they should be safely behind bars. ’How are the British public to trust David Cameron's Government to keep them safe when they are so terrible at the basics like keeping criminals locked up.' In the 12 months to September 2013 there were 46 criminals released from jail in error. The government insists this bungled releases equate to 0.06 per cent of all discharges from prison. Prisons minister Jeremy Wright said: ’Releases in error are taken very seriously and action has been taken to tighten processes and focus managers' attention in this area. ’Releases in error are infrequent and all incidents are subject to investigation. The majority of prisoners released in error are returned to custody quickly.’ In some instances, inmates let out by mistake are not returned to prison because the case against them is concluded while they are at large.","Since May 2010 jails have released 148 .

Sources said Mr Cameron had already decided to install parental controls – and believes it is right that all couples make an ‘active choice’ between them on whether to do the same. Mr Cameron said it was up to each family to make their own decision, but suggested that he thought those with children should opt to block adult material. The filters will apply to all devices linked to a home wi-fi network and across public networks where children are likely to be present. Adult content filters are expected to be fitted to all new mobile phones. Only an adult will be able to switch the filter on and off and the account holder will receive a confirmation email. Some providers are also offering text alerts, in case children hack into the account. The UK’s biggest internet service providers, who are responsible for connections in about 95 per cent of homes, agreed to sign up to the scheme after months of discussion with the Government. The Daily Mail – which yesterday exclusively revealed a crackdown by Google and Microsoft on web searches for child porn – has campaigned to make family-friendly filters ‘default on’ to protect children. Yesterday's Daily Mail front page which exclusively revealed a crackdown by Google and Microsoft on web searches for child porn . There has been growing alarm at evidence that a third of youngsters have accessed online pornography by the time they are ten years old. Six in ten parents now say they are worried about their sons and daughters seeing violent and sexual material on the web. However, the Government’s initiative has been criticised by some, including planning minister Nick Boles, who argued adults should be free to enjoy ‘legal’ pornography without lecturing from ministers. ‘As a Conservative, my starting point is that people should be free to live their lives as they choose. I am not going to start lecturing consenting adults about their private enjoyment of legal pornography,’ Mr Boles said. But Mr Cameron told BBC Radio 2: ‘I’m not lecturing in that way. ‘What I’m saying is that as a parent and as a politician, I think other parents would welcome the fact that when you sign up to an online account, you get a prompt so that you have to think about whether you want an internet in your house where your children can sometimes accidentally or on purpose search for pornographic images.’ He added: ‘It’s certainly not lecturing people on what to do, it’s helping them with something that people continually say to me “we’d like some help with”.’ Mr Cameron was challenged over how couples will agree on web access, if a husband wants the filters switched off and a wife wants to block pornography. The Prime Minister said: ‘Well, they’re going to have to have a discussion, aren’t they? ‘The fact is, I think what ought to happen here and what is going  to happen now is when you sign up to an internet service provider … you are prompted with an online message which is, there are these pornography filters that are switched on. ‘If you want to keep them, go ahead, particularly if you’ve got children in the house. If you want to take them off, you have to make an active choice.’ Mr Cameron described the move, supported by Virgin Media, TalkTalk, BSkyB and BT, as ‘real progress’ for parents. In a further effort to tackle online paedophiles, Britain’s National Crime Agency is joining America’s FBI in a task force to target those who use encrypted networks. London will host an international summit on the issue next year. The Government also plans to change the law so that anyone found with pornography depicting rape could be jailed for up to three years. Google confirmed yesterday it will block internet search results linked to child abuse and has developed a way of tagging illegal videos across the web. Microsoft is implementing similar changes.","Twenty million homes will be asked if they want filter .

"Residents of Brookfield Road have never viewed their neighbourhood as anything other than the nondescript village cul-de-sac that it is. The idea that those mundane redbrick terrace homes were touched by legend might have raised a northern chuckle or two. But that was the reality villagers were coming to terms with last night after a historian declared the street, in Standish, near Wigan, is the most likely location of Camelot, the mythical court of King Arthur. Residents of Brookfield Road, road sign pictured, said they were 'stunned' to discover their lane has been named as the epicentre of Arthurian legend . Where homeowners now park their cars . and leave wheelie bins out for collection, it is said the Knights of the . Round Table once gathered at the great castle. The claims have been made by Graham Robb, who carried out extensive geographical research in preparation for a book. He . says ancient Celts built their major towns and settlements along . straight lines calculated by the rising and the setting of the sun. Historian Graham Robb believes King Arthur's, illustration pictured, Camelot was built at the end of Brookfield Road, Standish in Wigan . All . royal courts had to have good road links and Mr Robb theorises the . present location of Brookfield Road was a very ‘significant’ spot. In . his work, The Ancient Paths: Discovering the Lost Map of Celtic Europe, . he suggests it was the meeting place of two major Celtic pathways. Geographical evidence of the two ancient routes made this location a prominent one in medieval Britain, he claims. If legend is to be believed, King Arthur and his Court were the rulers of Britain in the late 5th and early 6th centuries. According to histories and romances, the heroic monarch led the defence of Britain against wave after wave of Saxon invaders. The . locality is not completely new to Arthurian links. The nearby beauty . spot of Martin Mere, the largest freshwater lake in England, has long . been claimed to be the water in which the famous Arthurian sword, . Excalibur, was thrown by Sir Lancelot. A Camelot theme park was opened a . few miles away in 1983 aiming to make the most of the legend but it . closed in 2012. Mr Robb, who . won the Whitbread Book Award in 1997, says his geographical research . makes it ‘more plausible than ever’ that the small corner of Wigan could . be the location of the mythical Camelot. His . claims have been taken up by a local campaign group which is trying to . stop a link road being built in the area. The council wants to construct . a highway across a patch of woodland at the end of Brookfield Road. This aerial view shows Old Pepper Lane in Standish on the left, the Brookfield Road cul-de-sac in the centre, leading to a stretch of woodland on the right where Robb believes Camelot was built . Robb claims the precise location of Camelot was at the end of Brookfield Road, in the village of Standish, marked right. The cul-de-sac is near Martin Mere, marked left, the lake in which local legend claims the sword Excalibur was thrown . Robb added that the crossing pathways, pictured, on what is now the cul-de-sac 'have an astonishing power to illuminate the long-buried past by revealing the location of the legendary court of King Arthur.' The intersection lies at the end of a cul-de-sac off Old Pepper Lane where a tracks leads to woodland, pictured . A . spokesman for Stop Almond Brook Link Road said the revelations mean the . area should be preserved and the planned highway scrapped. ‘We . have lots of issues with this link road, including it going past school . playing fields which could harm the health of pupils and destroying . wildlife habitats,’ he said. ‘But we didn’t think for one minute that the route would also run through what could be Camelot.’ He . added: ‘This site needs a lot more investigation. We just need a white . knight to come along and help us save it from development. ‘We stumbled on this new theory while researching our campaign but it does tie in with local legends about King Arthur. ‘Wigan Council should be embracing its links with the distant past and not ripping it up.’ Arthurian legend claims Arthur was the son and heir of King Uther Pendragon, and was born on Castle Island in Tintagel, North Cornwall. The remains of Tintagel Castle is pictured . A lake on the woodland where King Arthur's Camelot was thought to have been built. King Arthur was a legendary British leader of the late 5th and early 6th centuries who according to histories and romances, led the defence of Britain against invaders in the early 6th century . Tony Stanley, 69, who has lived in the cul-de-sac for more than 40 years, said: ‘I just started laughing when I heard about it. ‘I thought someone was having a joke for April Fools’ Day but then I realised it’s still March.’ The . details of Arthur’s story are shrouded in folklore and his existence is . disputed by modern historians. But Mr Robb said that even if Camelot . was a myth, it is likely the site was of ‘religious or cultural . significance to the Celtic people and later Roman visitors’. ‘The North West of England from North Cheshire to the Scottish Border is strongly linked to Arthur’s legend,’ he added. The first mention of the Round Table was in 1155. This book claimed the round table was a wedding gift to Arthur from Guinevere's father, Leodegrance and is now believed to be hung in the Great Hall in Winchester, pictured . King Arthur was a legendary British leader . of the late 5th and early 6th centuries who according to histories and . romances, led the defence of Britain against invaders in the early 6th . century. However, the King Arthur that many people are familiar with today – thanks to TV shows, films and stage productions – is said to be a combination of many different myths and legends that have developed over the last 1,000 years. Arthurian legend claims Arthur was the son and heir of King Uther Pendragon, and was believed to have born on Castle Island in Tintagel, North Cornwall. A sorcerer called Merlin is said to have taken a sword called Excalibur from the so-called Lady of the Lake for King Uther, but upon the King’s death, he placed the sword in a stone. Merlin stated that ‘he who draws the sword from the stone, he shall be king.’ After the King's death, Arthur is said to have pulled Merlin’s Excalibur sword from this stone, proving his right to the throne. The . legend doesn’t specify exactly where this lake was and there is a debate . on whether it was Martin Mere in Lancashire, the Lily Ponds at . Bosherston, or Dozmary Pool on the edge of Bodmin Moor. The latter is . closest to the supposed birthplace in Cornwall. Legend continues that during his reign, in the kingdom of Camelot, King Arthur met with his knights at a Round Table, journeyed after the Holy Grail and fought a number of battles using the infamous sword. During the Battle of Camlann, in approximately 537, King Arthur was killed and his body was sent to the Isle of Avalon. Historians believe this area was Glastonbury and the Somerset levels. Later, legend expanded the story and . claimed upon Arthur's death, the sword was returned to . the Lady of the Lake. Early written accounts of the Arthurian story appeared in 1130 in Geoffrey of Monmouth's History of the Kings of Britain where he claimed Merlin had the 15-year-old Arthur crowned at nearby Silchester, in Reading. The first mention of the Round Table, however, was in Robert Wace's Roman de Brut in 1155. This book claimed the round table was a wedding gift to Arthur from Guinevere's father, Leodegrance and is now believed to be hung in the Great Hall in Winchester (pictured above). Arthur was said to have sat his knights on the round table so that none was ever in a position of power of importance. The author did add his assertions were not to be taken literally. 'I used an example of these connecting Celtic pathways in what is now that area and how years later a Camelot theme park popped up nearby. ''If you happen to look on a modern map and see the word 'Camelot', as in the theme park, it might look like this is where Camelot may have been. 'Sadly this type of thing, which I meant as a joke, can be misinterpreted by people who want to believe what they want to believe.'","Historian Dr Graham Robb believes King Arthur’s Camelot was in Wigan .

"Facebook may have bought Oculus Rift, but now Google is splashing out virtual reality technology too. The search giant is leading a $542m investment in Magic Leap, which claims to have invented a realistic version of virtual and augmented reality, dubbed 'cinematic reality'. The Florida-based firm's website features a little elephant moving around realistically in a person's hands, to show off their capabilities. Scroll down for video . Google is reportedly set to invest $500 million (£314 million) in Magic Leap, which claims to be a realistic version of virtual and augmented reality, dubbed 'cinematic reality'. The Florida-based firm's website features a little elephant (pictured) moving around realistically in a person's hands, to show what it can do . Magic Leap said it raised $542 million in a funding round led by Google Inc. Little is known about Magic Leap's product, but founder and CEO Rony Abovitz said in February that his company's mission was to 'develop and commercialize.. the most natural and human-friendly wearable computing interface in the world.' Investors in the latest round included Qualcomm Inc , the world's No.1 mobile phone chipmaker, Andreessen Horowitz, KKR and Legendary Entertainment. Sundar Pichai, senior vice president of Android, Chrome and Apps at Google, will join Magic Leap's board. Paul Jacobs, executive chairman of Qualcomm, will join Magic Leap's board as an observer. Gamers hope that Facebook and Google's involvement in the virtual reality space will accelerate the technology, which would make playing games and watching films more realistic, as well as creating other immersive experiences. Magic Leap's system claims to be more realistic than the Oculus Rift (pictured). The firm was acquired earlier this year by Facebook for $2 billion, and gamers are waiting for a consumer version of the virtual reality headset to be launched . An expert has claimed that ultra-realistic games played using virtual reality headsets could kill people. Denny Unger believes that the technology is so immersive that the first incidence of someone being scared to death, is not far away. Mr Unger, creative director at Cloudhead Games warned a virtual reality panel in Seattle that 'we're very close to having the first death in VR',Gizmodo reported. He said:'When the commercial version comes out, somebody is going to scare somebody to death - somebody with a heart condition or something like that. It is going to happen. Absolutely.' Many realistic video games played on standard consoles make players feel tense and villains often jump out and 'attack' gamers. But this effect could be intensified hugely when virtual reality headsets become widely available. Very few details about the technology have been revealed, aside from saying it offers a more realistic experience than Oculus Rift. Mr Abovitz told The South Florida Business Journal that virtual reality and augmented reality are old terms, with a largely disappointing history. 'We have the term 'cinematic reality' because we are disassociated with those things. … When you see this, you will see that this is computing for the next 30 or 40 years. 'To go farther and deeper than we're going, you would be changing what it means to be human.' It is likely that the device will show wearers hi-resolution images close to their face, by projecting pictures onto the eye. Viewers will probably see different angles and depths when they adjust their focus. This would be beneficial because Magic Leap could mix virtual reality images with the real world. While it is not clear what form the technology takes, Mr Abovitz has previously said that he hopes it could one day be built into a pair of glasses, in which case, Google may aim on incorporating 'cinematic reality' into future iterations of Google Glass.

Viewers will probably see different angles and depths when they adjust their focus. An image showing the burring of a fantastical virtual reality object and the real world produced by the company is pictured . The smart spectacles already enable users to access augmented reality elements. Using a particular app for example, runners can wear the glasses to see monsters chasing them. The glasses also superimpose information on the periphery of a wearer's vision. Facebook spent $2 billion buying Oculus earlier this year, which makes a virtual reality headset, mostly aimed at gamers. Unlike Magic Leap's future device, it blocks out the real world around the user. While it is not clear what form the technology takes, Mr Abovitz has previously said that he hopes it could one day be built into a pair of glasses, in which case, Google may aim on incorporating 'cinematic reality' into future iterations of Google Glass (pictured) Last month, Oculus unveiled its Crescent Bay model of the virtual reality technology that is lighter than its predecessor, and now features 360-degree tracking. Reports claimed the consumer version of the device will launch in 2015 and could cost as little as $200 (£122) The 360-degree tracking means the headset will be able to more accurately monitor a wearer's head movements, which in turn will make games more immersive and true-to-life. Elsewhere, the headset has a higher resolution, per eye, than the current second-generation development kit – DK2 - and these displays are powered by Samsung devices. A teardown of the DK2 revealed that the headset uses Samsung Galaxy Note 3 displays, and experts claim the latest generation device will feature screens from the flagship Note 4. By comparison, the DK2 has a resolution of 960 x 1080 per eye, and the Note 4 screens would give the latest model 1280 x 1440 resolution. Aside from these specifications, Oculus VR is yet to release the rest of Crescent Bay's features, or a price tag for the gadget.","Google leads $542m investment  in Magic Leap .

"Hundreds of Nigerian schoolgirls kidnapped two weeks again are being sold to as wives to Islamic militants for as little as £8 each, it has been claimed. The teenagers were abducted from their secondary school, in Chibok, in the middle of the night by armed men from Boko Haram and are believed to have smuggled across the borders to Cameroon and Chad Republic. Some of them have been forced to marry against their will and are being used as servants and sex slaves, according to a community elder. A protestor turns out for the mass demonstration to help bring home the hundreds of schoolgirls taken from their dormitories by extreme Islamists . Rescue our daughters: A cry from a pleading mother at a mass demonstration taking place across Nigeria today . Pogo Bitrus told The Times the captors were selling the girls aged 16-18 into servitude by forcing them to marry other members of the extremist group. 'If these captors are trying to achieve a political point, I think the best thing is for us to try to make sure that they don’t succeed,' he said. 'But from all indications they are succeeding, due to inaction of government it is helping these people in achieving their objectives.' He said that the girls had been ferried to Cameroon and Chad by canoe where prospective husbands were paying around 2,000 naira (£8) for a bride. The girls were kidnapped on April 14 by gunmen who raided the dormitories taking the girls while they slept. Initially officials said that about 85 girls had been taken. But it later emerged that as many as 234 were missing. So far, none of the schoolgirls have been rescued. About 40 managed to escape the grips of their heavily armed captors - believed to members of a Jihad Islamist group. Parents and other town residents have mounted a search in the Sambisa Forest, which borders Chibok town and is a known hideout for the militants. The troubled country has also seen  demonstrators protest against the closure of schools in Abuja. Police turned out firing live bullets, water cannons and spraying tear gas. A man weeps as he joins parents of kidnapped school girls during a meeting with the Borno State governor in Chibok, Maiduguri, Borno State April 22. They had no weapons and eventually were forced to turn back. Security sources have said they are in 'hot pursuit' of the abductors, but so far they have not rescued any of the kidnap victims . The girls' families and their supporters have now organised mass demonstrations across Nigeria in an attempt to force President Goodluck Jonathan to take more drastic action. Boko Haram has been abducting girls and young women in attacks on schools, villages and towns, but the latest mass kidnapping is unprecedented. The extremists use the young women as porters, cooks and sex slaves, according to Nigerian officials. Boko Haram has a history of abducting women, and there has been an estimated 10,000 deaths caused by the group since it was formed in 2002.

"If you've ever woken up bewildered by a dream you were having, there's now an explanation as to why. Scientists have discovered our dreams really do get weirder as the night goes on. 'We found that dreams increase in bizarreness from the early to late night,' said study author Dr Josie Malinowski, of the University of Bedfordshire. Shortly before a person wakes up, their dreams escalate to a level of the impossible - and never likely to happen in real life - 'like a wild animal tearing up your back garden,' she told TIME. Scroll down for video . Shortly before a person wakes up, their dreams escalate to a level of the impossible - and never likely to happen in real life . Not only that, they become more emotional - in both a good and bad way - says Dr Malinowski, a lecturer in cognitive psychology. During the study, researchers gave 16 people an eyelid and head sensor to monitor their sleep. They then woke each person up four times in the night, journalist Mandy Oaklander reports. Participants were asked to recall the subject of their dreams and discuss them - and how they might relate to their life - the following morning. In the early stages of sleep, dreams tended to be more about the people had encountered that day, such as a TV programme or a book. Dreams about life events were more likely to feature later in the night. Dr Malinowski says exploring these dreams can help us get more in touch with our emotional side and behaviour. She said: 'People feel like they haven't generated them because they're often so bizarre. [But] they're a safe way to explore the self.' There are two stages of sleep - REM and non-REM sleep. During the latter, we experience slow wave sleep, when our immune system is repaired and strengthened. However being under the weather can also trigger strange dreams and nightmares, experts say. Any kind of infection, from severe flu to a kidney infection, can make nightmares more likely, explains Patrick McNamara, associate professor of neurology at Harvard Medical School. Being ill, such as having an infection, can trigger nightmares, research has shown . 'When we get an infection, with or without a fever, the body needs more slow wave sleep. This is so the immune system can fight the bug. However, he adds it also has a knock-on effect on REM sleep, delaying the point at which we enter dreaming sleep. 'This, in turn, can lead to nightmares or bizarre, vivid dreams.' As REM sleep is when we process emotions, this can cause a build-up of unpleasant emotions which may manifest as nightmares. Some experts also believe premenstrual syndrome can lead to more nightmares. A 2008 study found women reported significantly more nightmares than men (30 per cent of women's most recent dreams were nightmares compared with 19 per cent of men). Study author Dr Jennie Parker, a psychologist at the University of the West of England, said the nightmares were linked to temperature changes that occurred at certain times in a woman's cycle. Previous research has found women with PMS are more likely to have nightmares . The increase in the hormone progesterone, which women experience before a period, causes their body temperature to rise and has been linked to PMS-related insomnia. This can cause night sweats and hot flushes, as well as vivid dreams and nightmares. 'Premenstrual women tend to dream more aggressively and are more likely to remember dreams,' adds Dr Parker. Not getting enough shut-eye in the week could explain nightmares during your weekend lie-in. Many women also report more bizarre dreams around the menopause, says Dr Tony Boret, a consultant gynaecologist at Spire Bushey Hospital. Up to ten years preceding the menopause, levels of female hormone oestrogen significantly drop. This affects levels of serotonin, a brain chemical associated with hot flushes, mood swings and night sweats, and can lead to sleep disruption in around 15 per cent of women, he says. This can cause excessive tiredness and more broken sleep. Sometimes our nightmares can reflect waking health concerns, such as breathing problems. A study published in the journal Dreaming in 2006 found those with breathing problems during wakefulness often reported dreaming about being choked or suffocated; those who perspired excessively while awake often dreamed about sweating. 'Our dreaming brains deal in metaphors and symbols,' says Professor McNamara. 'During REM sleep, the brain tries to capture and process overwhelming sensations, things that are troubling us, or that we can't put into words. It does this through the pictures we see in our dreams.'","Dreams increase in bizarreness as the night wears on, psychologists found .

"Swampy now: Going by his real name these days, Daniel Hooper lives in a yurt with his four children in a remote hippy commune in the Welsh valleys . He was once at the forefront of every major environmental protest in Britain. Known as Swampy, he gained notoriety by tunnelling under a bypass to try to stop construction of a road. But the once dreadlocked eco-warrior has turned his back on protesting and is living in a remote hippy commune in Wales. He no longer wants to be called Swampy and instead goes by his real name, Daniel Hooper. The 40-year-old lives with his four children in a yurt alongside 100 hippies, New Age travellers and nudists in a 200-acre stretch of farmland in the Welsh valleys. The assortment of characters in the camp live in tepees, caravans, yurts and mud houses. There is a communal tent, Big Lodge, where they gather for yoga sessions and meditation. The group, who appear almost entirely self-sufficient, even hold raves and full moon parties in the valley. They are more than ten miles from the nearest town, Llandeilo in Carmarthenshire. Swampy and his children sleep rough on sheepskins in his yurt. Solar panels provide power for a small radio and a mobile phone. However, the children do attend the local school each day, dressed in traditional uniform. The council even sends a school bus up the dirt track to the commune to pick them up. The former eco-warrior spends his days as a tree surgeon for the Forestry Commission and tries to make time to tend to his vegetable patch. And in the evenings he takes his children walking or climbing. He said: ‘I’ve got a family now and a home. I can’t run off for weeks at a time. But my views on the environment are just the same. 'There is part of me that misses that life. Spending a week up a crane in protest to the construction of Terminal 5 at Heathrow was something special, but I leave it to others at the moment.’ Hippy home: The family live in this virtually self-contained hippy community near Talley, west Wales, with the former eco-warrior spending his days working as a tree surgeon for the Forestry Commission . The single father says he has no plans to join the anti-fracking protesters in Balcombe, West Sussex. But he admits he could resurface as an eco-warrior if fracking companies started drilling in Wales. ‘I have a strong opinion on fracking,’ he said. ‘I hope the protesters succeed in what they are doing and change the Tory policy on fracking, like our protests changed Labour’s policy on road building in the 1990s.’ On a protest in 1997: Swampy and other protesters dug tunnels beneath the planned A30 bypass in Devon, then he helped to build a network of tunnels to try to stop the expansion of Manchester airport . Born to middle-class parents Peter and Jill, both now 70, in Berkshire, Swampy made his name in 1996 when he led hundreds of protesters who chained themselves to trees in protest at the construction of a bypass in Newbury. A year later he and other protesters dug tunnels beneath the planned A30 bypass in Devon, then he helped to build a network of tunnels to try to stop the expansion of Manchester airport. Despite the actions of Swampy and his fellows, all the projects went ahead.","Daniel Hooper is now a tree surgeon for the Forestry Commission .

"Brian Houston, the son of Hillsong founder Frank Houston, has told a hearing about the moment he found out his father was a paedophile. Mr Houston, the church's senior pastor, first heard the allegations levelled by AHA - the name for the alleged victim -  in late October 1999 during his weekly meeting with general manager George Aghajanian. He said he did not immediately report the incident to the police as he did not want to 'pre-empt' the victim. During the pivotal meeting, Mr Houston said he and Mr Aghajanian were discussing other matters  until Mr Aghajanian said: 'I need to talk to you about something else. 'It's not about you, it's about your father.' Scroll down for video . Hillsong senior pastor Brian Houston, left, fronted the Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Abuse today.

'It hit me in a ten second period, in a wave,' Mr Houston told the Commission. Mr Houston said he could tell from the look on Mr Houston's face that it was not good news. 'It hit me in a ten second period, in a wave,' he said, telling the commission 'you never forget' the moment you find out your father is a paedophile. He told the hearing he first he had to get his head around his father being a homosexual, before he realised Mr Aghanajanian was talking about paedophilia. Mr Houston then cried and went home. 'I was devastated, to be honest with you,' he said. 'Totally devastated.' On Tuesday, AHA told the commission Frank Houston would stay with his family when he came to Sydney from New Zealand in the 1970s. AHA was seven when Frank Houston would come to his room, lie on him, fondle him and masturbate him, the alleged victim told the commission. 'I would wake up petrified and I would stay very still,' AHA said. He said the abuse left him feeling ashamed, and he now suffered depression. Mr Houston told the hearing that if AHA was under 18 - he was in his mid-30s at the time of the complaint - then he was 'absolutely certain' they would have gone to the police. 'Rightly or wrongly, I thought I would be preempting the victim if I were to have called the police at that point,' Mr Houston said. Controversy: Brian Houston's Hillsong church is immensely popular. Mr Houston is the senior pastor at the Hillsong Church, located in Sydney's north-western suburbs. Brian Houston, pictured leaving the Royal Commission this week. His testimony will continue on Thursday afternoon. Rules were set aside by the executive of the Pentecostal movement when it came to dealing with allegations against Frank Houston, the father of Hillsong senior pastor Brian Houston, the national inquiry was told earlier on Thursday. Keith Ainge, former national secretary of the Assemblies of God, an umbrella body for the Pentecostal churches, said that Brian Houston was the only conduit for information to the executive about allegations against his father. The church elder told the Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse that the first the national executive heard of allegations against Frank Houston was when his son Brian Houston called a special meeting of the executive on December 22, 1999. Brian Houston was national president of the AoG. He had already suspended his father when he called the meeting. Pastor Ainge on Thursday said that under AoG rules Frank Houston should have had his credentials withdrawn for abusing a child. Instead the meeting on December 22 suspended them for two years and recommended that Frank Houston enter a restorative program. In reply to questions from counsel assisting the commission Simeon Beckett, Pastor Ainge said he truthfully could not answer why the policy was not followed 'except to say that it was a new policy and not fully understood and the fact there was no formal complaint and the complainant did not give his name'. Mr Beckett: 'according to Brian Houston?' When asked about Brian Houston's conflict of interest and the executive's dependence on him to investigate his father and take action Pastor Ainge: 'Yes, we agree it was a difficult situation from that perspective ...' Mr Beckett: You were relying on what Brian Houston said about the complainant not wanting it to go to the police; is that correct? Pastor Ainge: 'Correct'. Mr Beckett: And you had not had an independent person deal with the complainant? Pastor Ainge: That's correct. On Tuesday, AHA said his family was very involved in the church, and when he eventually told his mother in 1978 she told him he did not 'want to be responsible for turning people from the church and sending them to hell'. He said the Houstons 'were considered to be almost like royalty' in the circles in which his parents moved. The witness said when, in 1998, his mother told another church pastor of the abuse, Frank Houston apologised. He was told if there were any problems to contact Frank or Brian Houston. He said after two months he rang Brian and said: 'What is happening with the money I was promised? I agreed to forgive your father.' AHA said Brian Houston said 'Yes, OK, I'll get the money for you. There's no problem. You know it's your fault all of this happened. You tempted my father'. AHA said he replied: 'Why, did he molest you also?' He said Brian got very angry after that. 'He slammed the phone down with words to the effect 'You'll be getting money'.' While acknowledging AHA's courage in appearing at the commission, Brian Houston rejected the claims that he accused him of tempting his father. 'I disagree with his perception of the phone call with me and I strongly refute that I - at any time - accused him of tempting my father. I would never say this and I do not believe this,' he said in a statement made outside the commission. 'At no stage did I attempt to hide or cover up the allegations against my father.' The hearing is ongoing.","Brian Houston found out about the allegations in a regular meeting with the church's general manager George Aghajanian .

"A Birmingham mother claims she is lucky to be alive after tiles from the roof of her house were blown off by a low-flying plane. Sharon Ward, 51, from Kitts Green, described the scene as 'absolute carnage' after about 20 of the slates smashed into her backyard. The freak winds  are believed to have been caused by a vortex created by a plane that passed overhead at about 2.20pm on Saturday en route to the nearby Birmingham Airport. Sharon Ward, 51, holds one of about 20 tiles which blew off the roof of her Birmingham house on Saturday . The 'carnage' on the roof of shopping assistant Sharon's council house after the tiles were blown off . Ward holds one of the tiles outside her house in Kitts Green, in Birmingham, that could have hit her . Moments before Sharon heard the loud crash she said neighbouring children were playing just yards from where the large ceramic tiles smashed into the crowd. 'It looks like a bomb site as about 20 tiles came off and smashed in my garden and onto the furniture outside,' Sharon told the Birmingham Mail. 'I'm lucky I wasn't sunbathing as I am usually outside if there's a spot of sunshine. The tiles could have fallen onto me. 'The neighbour's children had been playing outside ten minutes earlier. They could have been seriously hurt. 'It's so dangerous and something needs to be done about this. 'Another neighbour was in his garden at the time and said he saw a plane flying low over my house. 'I tried calling the airport but I was told to call back on Monday.' The airport has confirmed they are 'looking into the incident' after being informed by the press. It is not known which plane was responsible or at what height it was flying. It was reported in 2009 that hundreds of houses in the Kitts Green were forced to get new roofs after vortex winds caused by landing planes caused damage. The findings of resulting studies by the airport and the company Kinetic, which works with the Ministry of Defence, were not conclusive. The tiles, which Ward believes were blown off by a plane, smashed into her yard near where children  played . It is believed the tiles were blown off by the vortex winds caused by a plane landing at Birmingham Airport . A member of the airport's environment team said: 'Locating risk areas is very difficult. It can be the case that one side of the street has strikes and the other hasn't - it is very difficult to predict.' The incident comes more than a year after Heathrow Airport promised to repair a widow's house after a passenger jet caused tiles to fall off her room. Grandmother-of-four Patricia Hills was left with three large holes - with shattered tiles thrown as far as 20ft away from her home. A spokesperson for Birmingham Airport said they are looking into the incident at Ward's house . 'It looks like a bomb site as about 20 tiles came off and smashed in my garden,' Ward says . Some even smashed the headlights and dented the front of a neighbour's car. At the time, Mrs Hills said the 'vortex' gust left the scene outside her home looking like a 'warzone'. She now fears for her safety at the house in Old Windsor, Berkshire - which is under Heathrow's flightpath. A spokesman for BAA said in March 2013 an assessor had been to Mrs Hills' house and the company will now send men around to replace her damaged roof. He said: 'It is rare, but we have a policy of carrying out repairs where this has happened to people.' Mrs Hills said: 'BAA have acted honourably and I'm very pleased at their quick response.'","Sharon Ward, 51, said she heard a plane moments before tiles smashed .

"Jack Monroe, pictured with her three-year-old son Jonny, has bagged herself a book deal with Penguin following the success of her Girl Called Jack blog . A single mother who has turned her 9p meals into a book deal has urged shoppers not to be put off value-brand food to make their money go further. Jack Monroe, 25, has been documenting her attempts at feeding herself and her three-year-old son Jonny on £10 a week for the past year. A 9p carrot, cumin and kidney bean burger, 30p chilli and 22p apricot curry are among the frugal and healthy recipes that have caught the attention of publisher Penguin, which has signed her up to produce a book packed with more than 100 ideas for making the most of a tight budget. Ms Monroe, from Southend, was . job-hunting and living on benefits when she started her blog following a . councillor's attack on single mothers in her local paper, which . appeared under the headline: 'Druggies, drunks and single mums are . ruining our town'. She began attending council meetings and writing about politics and budget meals on her A Girl Called Jack blog following encouragement from friends. She used a Nokia E72 phone to write and upload her posts as she does not own a computer. Since then, she has appeared on the BBC Breakfast sofa to talk about her experience. A nutritionist on the show told her that the portion sizes were too small. But Ms Monroe told MailOnline: 'I eat four times a day, have breakfast, lunch, dinner, tea and snacks. 'You could eat twice as much and still save lots of money.' Ms . Monroe shops from the value and reduced ranges at Sainsbury's, her . nearest shop, and grows her own herbs to make the most of her £10, which is what she has left . after paying bills and rent. She sang the praises of value ranges, where kidney beans and chopped tomatoes are a quarter of the price of the branded equivalents, and said shoppers shouldn't be turned off by the 'unattractive' packaging of the bottom shelf products. Local food banks also give out copies of her . recipes to help others feeding themselves on very little. Scroll down for video . Ms Monroe, 24, was invited to appear on BBC Breakfast to talk about her blog and now has a deal with Penguin books . They include . ideas for simple herb bread at 7p a portion, lemon curd sponge puddings at 24p and . posh mushroom, spinach and walnut pasta at 34p. 'Chopped tomatoes turn up in pretty . much everything', she said, while handfuls of frozen vegetables, such as . green beans and spinach, pad out meals and flour, pasta, rice and . UHT or soya milk are cupboard essentials. 'I throw things together and if they work they make it on to the blog.' Ms Monroe, who was recently hired as a trainee reporter at the Southend Echo, has criticised the Government for not understanding the difficulties of those surviving on benefits. This week, she revealed that a two thirds cut in her tax credits means she is going to downsize from her two-bed flat to a place where she will share a room with her son, to avoid having to quit her job to save money on childcare. 'It can happen to anyone,' she told The Independent. 'People quote Iain Duncan Smith’s . claim about being able to live on £53 a week all of the time, but they . don’t realise that when get that payment you have to cover everything . with it. You are not exempt from bills all of a sudden.' She told MailOnline: 'If they could spend a week with one of us, they'd see things a lot differently'. She receives emails, messages and . tweets every day from people who say her blog has helped them make savings and . cope with the shock of redundancy. 'You feel like you're the only person in the world this has happened to,' she said. But the blog has made her realise: 'You're not going through this on your own.' This bean and vegetable burger with vegetable rice, posted to her Twitter page during a Live Below the Line challenge, cost only 14p . In one blogpost, entitled Hunger Hurts, she . wrote: 'Poverty isn’t just having no heating, or not quite enough food, . or unplugging your fridge and turning your hot water off. 'It’s not a tourism trade, it’s not cool, and it’s not something that MPs on a salary of £65k a year plus expenses can understand, let alone our PM who states that we’re all in this together. 'Poverty is the sinking feeling when your small boy finishes his one Weetabix and says ‘more mummy, bread and jam please mummy’ as you’re wondering whether to take the TV or the guitar to the pawn shop first, and how to tell him that there is no bread or jam.' She has raised more than £2,500 for Oxfam through her blog by taking on a Live Below the Line challenge to feed her family for a week on only £5. Jack Monroe's book is due out next March . It was her friend's Facebook photos of his meals when he took on of the challenge last summer that prompted her to 'do it better', she said. She bought one of everything from the supermarket's value range and thought: 'Right - what can I make out of this?' Her blog readers have become an online support group, she told MailOnline. 'Every time I spoke to friends I was banging on about how awful things were. 'I was boring myself.' She refers back to the Hunger Hurts post as 'the pinnacle' of how bad things were while she was unemployed and trying to support herself and her child. 'People tell me: ""Thank god it's not just me, I'm in the same situation"".' Ms Monroe gave birth to her son while . she worked at a fire service call centre, but the job and relationship . with her son's father did not work out, and he was unable to support . them. She was approached for advice by Labour MP Helen Goodman, who fed herself for a week on £18 in February to experience what life would be like for her constituents in Bishop Auckland once the 'bedroom tax' came into force last month. Ms Monroe told MailOnline: 'I would say the cuts are quite draconian, though I do understand we don't have an endless pot to prop up welfare.' She called for a change in the way housing benefit is paid, criticising the way it is paid every four week in arrears rather than monthly and in advance, and highlighted the stress of having to negotiate with letting agents and landlords for their patience. She found herself in difficulties with her rent payments when she registered for housing benefit, becoming nearly three months in arrears in the eight weeks it took to process her claim.

Lindsey Evans, the cookery publisher at Penguin, said: 'Jack Monroe is a fresh new voice for our times and I am so pleased that Penguin will be publishing her first cookbook.

"Leicester Tigers will play great rivals Northampton Saints away in the Aviva Premiership semi-finals next weekend after clinching third place with a bonus point victory over leaders Saracens at Welford Road. The reigning champions claimed a 31-27 victory after coming out on top in a dramatic 21-minute period either side of half time when six tries were scored, Saracens winger Michael Tagicakibau was sin-binned and flanker Justin Melck was sent off for what appeared to be eye-gouging. Over: Manu Tuilagi (left) of Leicester Tigers celebrates his try . Reduced: Justin Melck of Saracens is sent off for what appeared to be eye-gouging . Leicester hit back from 8-3 to take a 10-8 lead just before half time thanks to a penalty try, while further touch downs from Manu Tuilagi, Blaine Scully and Graham Kitchener ensured they took a bonus point. Saracens' tries came from Ben Spencer (2), a penalty try and Jack Wilson, with Spencer's second four minutes from time earning his side a losing bonus point. They will play Harlequins, who beat Bath, in the other semi final at home. Both sides were under-strength, especially Saracens who rested most of their top 30 players, with a Heineken Cup final and possibly the Premiership final on the horizon. Lock Hayden Smith made his first start since rejoining Saracens, while England under-20 flanker Maro Itoje made his Premiership debut. Out of bounds: Blaine Scully of Leicester Tigers attempts to go over for a try . England and Lions flanker Tom Croft made his comeback for Leicester after suffering a knee injury which needed surgery in round one. Leicester won the first half 10-8 but the small advantage came at a cost as the injuries started to mount with Owen Williams, David Mele, prop Boris Stankovich and lock Geoff Parling all picking up knocks. Stankovich lasted less than a minute before he trooped off, to be replaced by Marcos Ayerza, after suffering an injury at a ruck. Things got worse for Leicester a minute later when a lively Saracens team took the lead after some bright play resulted in scrum-half Ben Spencer making a break through the front of a ruck. Although he was held short of the line he reached and put the ball down over the line. Former England fly-half Charlie Hodgson missed the conversion on an afternoon when the strong wind made it difficult for the kickers, and three minutes later Williams pulled three points back with a penalty from in front of the posts. To the heavens: Manu Tuilagi holds up the ball to the sky after scoring a try . Saracens came close to scoring a second in the eighth minute after Hodgson beat Thomas Waldrom on halfway and made a fabulous break. Although the Tigers managed to prevent a try they conceded a penalty, which Hodgson slotted. Williams missed a long range penalty before he, and then Parling, suffered injuries and were replaced by Dan Bowden and Kitchener. The loss of Williams meant Toby Flood moved to fly-half, with Bowden taking over at centre, and with two minutes of the half left Bowden made a fine break which almost led to a try after great work by Niall Morris, Ayerza and Steve Mafi. Saracens' defence, however, held firm and Mele went off, to be replaced by Sam Harrison, after a tackle by Smith near the line. Mele returned for the second half. Leicester, however, marched Saracens back from the resulting scrum and the referee awarded a penalty try, with Flood adding the extras to give the Tigers a 10-8 half-time lead. Within four minutes of the restart that lead had become 17-8 and Saracens were reduced to 13 men after winger Tagicakibau was sin-binned for a tip tackle on Ayerza and flanker Melck sent off for what appeared to be gouging. Just: Graham Kitchener of Leicester Tigers reaches over for a try . A minute after the yellow card, Leicester's forwards rumbled towards the line and Flood put Tuilagi over under the posts. Four minutes later Leicester got their third try in nine minutes, Morris making a break before passing inside for fellow wing Scully to score, Flood adding the conversion. Saracens hit back in the 54th minute, the referee awarding them a penalty try after Leicester had collapsed a terrific rolling maul. Ben Spencer converted to make it 24-15. Four minutes later, Kitchener scored at the other end, Flood converting, and Croft immediately replaced Mafi. Croft had hardly got on the field when Saracens winger Wilson scored his side's third try. In 20 frantic minutes both sides had scored six tries and Saracens had been shown a yellow and a red card. With four minutes left Spencer intercepted a pass from Thomas Waldrom and ran 70 yards to score in the right corner before converting, but the Tigers were able to close out the victory.","Leicester overcame 14-man Saracens as both sides geared up for play-offs .

British volunteer Richard Cann has died on an Indonesian island, just days after revealing on Facebook that he had caughta life-threatening tropical disease Dengue fever . On Monday, Mr Cann, from Winchester, Hampshire, collapsed and died following a seizure. The project assistant flew out to south-east Asia in April this year to help protect the endangered primate on the island of Sumatra. He wrote on Facebook: 'Have had Dengue fever this last week. Slept solidly for the last four to five days and now feeling on the mend, but maybe next week will be 100 per cent. 'Sitting in 45C heat with no doctors and no air con, doping up on painkillers, hot water for the joints and a cat for cuddles. 'Nothing as dramatic as haemorrhagic fever. Should be fine next week.

Mr Cann was working with the Orangutan Health Project on the western Indonesian island of Sumatra . Richard was a member of the Royal Southern Yacht Club, based in Hamble, near Southampton, Hants, where he had been a junior cadet. Rear Commodore Sailing Karen Henderson-Williams released a statement informing members of the sad news. She wrote: 'It is with great sadness that I write to inform you of the the death of Richard Cann on Monday 23rd September, aged 24 years.

"Nigel Farage has written to all 59 Scottish MPs, calling on them to stop voting on English-only issues with immediate effect. In an attempt to seize the agenda on equal powers for England, the Ukip leader said he did not believe David Cameron wanted to ‘seriously address’ the issue. Mr Farage said he supported devolution across the United Kingdom, but warned sweeping powers could not be extended to Scotland without a ‘fair’ settlement for England. Scroll down for video . Nigel Farage warned sweeping powers could not be extended to Scotland without a fair settlement for England . He also hit out at the financial settlement, known as the Barnett Formula, which means taxpayers in England subsidise those north of the border. Tories fear Ukip could make capital out of any perception that England will lose out if Scotland gains the power to set its own spending, taxes and welfare policy – or so-called devo max – in return for staying in the UK, ahead of a potentially damaging by-election in Clacton next month. Ukip is tipped to win its first Westminster seat in the Essex town in a contest triggered by the defection of Eurosceptic former Conservative MP Douglas Carswell. Mr Cameron and the other party leaders have vowed to allow Scotland to keep the Barnett Formula in perpetuity – which means the amount of money given by the Treasury to Scotland works out at £1,600 a head more than England. Mr Farage also hit out at the financial settlement, known as the Barnett Formula, which means taxpayers in England subsidise those north of the border . Mr Farage said yesterday that Mr Cameron and Ed Miliband had ‘panicked’ in making generous promises to the Scottish government, on behalf of English taxpayers, after a ‘lacklustre’ start to the referendum campaign. ‘I’m happy for powers to go to Scotland provided the same privileges and powers are enjoyed by England too and I’m not convinced by what I’ve seen from Mr Cameron that he seriously wants to address that,’ Mr Farage said. ‘The English are 86 per cent by population of this Union. They’ve been left out of all of this for the last 18 years. We still have a situation where Scottish MPs can vote in the House of Commons on English-only issues. I think what most English people want is a fair settlement.’ He suggested having days in the Palace of Westminster when Scottish, Welsh and Irish MPs do not attend – effectively an English parliament but without a new building. But he added: ‘I’m going to write today to all 59 Scottish MPs and I’m going to say to them in the spirit of finding a fair settlement for the United Kingdom, will you please commit from today not to take part in debates or votes in Westminster on English devolved issues.’ Ukip is tipped to win its first Westminster seat in the Essex town in a contest triggered by the defection of Eurosceptic former Conservative MP Douglas Carswell . In the longer term, he called for a constitutional convention to find a way forward, adding: ‘That process is vital. Mr Cameron this morning, as a last-minute measure yet again, has decided to put William Hague in charge of a committee to try to cobble together a solution … I think we need a proper, open debate.’ Former minister Owen Paterson said people would see it as ‘unfair’ that Scottish politicians would continue to vote on taxes raised only in England. Conservative MP Bernard Jenkin said he was ‘mightily relieved’ Scotland had voted No, but urged Mr Cameron to engage with MPs on the ‘English question’, saying: ‘You can hear Alex Salmond teeing things up for the next row with Westminster because we’ve really no idea what these promises of extra powers actually are or what is meant by honouring the Barnett Formula.’ Ukip’s annual conference next week is expected to attract hundreds of new recruits. A party source said: ‘I wouldn’t be surprised if Nigel mentions English devolution in his conference speech, it’s a big issue. The conference will be a call to arms before Clacton.’","Nigel Farage has written to all 59 Scottish MPs calling on them to stop voting on English-only issues .

"A heavily pregnant women visited her GP for a whooping cough vaccination - only to be injected with an MMR jab. Emma Cave, 25, won a payout of £3,000 from her GP after she was mistakenly given the MMR jab 30 weeks into her pregnancy. The young mother said she suffered months of worry following the blunder after doctors told her they could not guarantee there was no risk to her unborn baby. Miss Cave went to the GP practice for a whooping cough vaccination but was later informed she'd been accidentally given the MMR jab. She had to wait until her son Harrison was six-weeks-old before she could finally be told for certain that he had not been harmed . Miss Cave had to wait until her son Harrison was six-weeks-old before she could finally be told for certain that he had not been harmed. As the MMR jab is prepared with weakened live viruses, doctors advise it is not suitable for women who are pregnant or who might become pregnant within a month after being vaccinated. Miss Cave said she was terrified to find out she had been given the jab while heavily pregnant. As the MMR jab is prepared with weakened live viruses, doctors advise  it is not suitable for women who are pregnant, or who might become pregnant within a month after being vaccinated. In theory, the weakened virus could give the mother an infection that they could pass on to their baby. The vaccinations recommended for pregnant women are: . Flu jab . Pregnant women have a higher chance of developing complications if they get flu, particularly in the later stages of pregnancy. Doctors advise getting vaccinated as soon as possible into the pregnancy. The flu vaccine is normally available from September until around January or February each year and is free for pregnant women. Whooping cough . Whooping cough is common at the moment and babies who are too young to start their vaccinations are at greatest risk. Young babies with whooping cough are often very unwell and most will be admitted to hospital because of their illness. In severe cases, they can die. Pregnant women should ideally get vaccinated 28- 32 weeks into their pregnancy, although they may be given the vaccine up to 38 weeks of pregnancy. Source: NHS Choices . She said: 'It is hard to take what has happened and remove it from your mind. 'I still can't understand how they made such as mistake.' Miss Cave, of Pudsey, West Yorkshire, went to a Leeds GP surgery last year for the whooping cough vaccine, which is routinely given during pregnancy. The next day she was contacted and told of the mistake. She said: 'I felt sick to the stomach when they told me what had happened. 'It was all a complete shock as you expect nurses and doctors to know what they are doing, and not make such silly, potentially serious mistakes. 'It wouldn't have been so bad had they been able to fully assure me there and then that there was no danger of harm to my baby, but they couldn't.' Miss Cave was sent to hospital, where she and partner Luke Egan were told the effect on their son would only become clear after their baby was born. 'From that point on I was constantly worrying' she said. 'I was in and out of hospital for checks because I couldn't feel the baby moving on many occasions, although perhaps the anxiety and stress of all I had gone through made me panicky.' Miss Cave took legal action through Neil Hudgell Solicitors and the GP surgery admitted the mistake and apologised. Senior solicitor Kay Barnes said: 'It was a mother's nightmare, an unfortunate incident involving negligent treatment which could have been completely avoided had proper care been taken.'

"Gus Poyet is confident he will still be Sunderland's head coach next season amid fevered speculation over his future. The 46-year-old Uruguayan has been linked with potential vacancies at both West Ham and Southampton in recent days, but has also found himself the subject of rumours that he could walk out of the Stadium of Light because of a power struggle behind the scenes. However, as a remarkable season drew to a close with a 3-1 home defeat by Swansea, crucially with the Black Cats still a Barclays Premier League club, Poyet insisted he was going nowhere. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Poyet: I am so proud of how we finished the season . Believers: Sunderland fans hold a banner for Gus Poyet ahead of Sunderland's final game of the season . To do list: Sunderland have beaten rivals Newcastle twice, been to Wembley and avoided relegation . Staying put: Sunderland manager Gus Poyet expects to still be Sunderland manager at the start of next season . Asked if he expected to be in charge in August, he said: 'Yes,' before adding with a smile: 'You are scaring me now. What do you know that I don't know? 'The rumours are natural, there are so many rumours all the time. But that means you are doing something special or you are being recognised for something, whatever it is. 'It could be the way your team plays, or it could be the achievement that you made or it could be that before, I didn't have on my CV Barclays Premier League experience and now I do in a very difficult situation.' Poyet, who revealed he is in talks with ""three or four"" of the club's 11 out-of-contract and loan players, revealed he had already met owner and chairman Ellis Short to discuss the way forward, and will do so again after a short break, but was adamant there was nothing sinister about those talks. He said: 'Every single manager in the world when he finishes the season has a meeting with the chairman of the football club, winning the league, going down, in the middle, having been named somewhere else, with contract, without contract - it's natural. 'Every now and then when a manager says, ""I need to meet with the chairman to see where we are going"", you all start to think, ""He's leaving"" or ""He's not happy"" or ""There's a problem"", but it's nothing. Get in! Sunderland fans look fired up as the players walk around the pitch to acknowledge the fans on Sunday . 'Yes, I . want to know where we are going, if it's possible not to make the same . mistakes that we have made in the last couple of years because I don't . want to go through another year like this one.' Sunderland ended the season in 14th place after a defeat in which they were up against it from the off. Nathan . Dyer fired Swansea ahead with a deft seventh-minute finish from Wayne . Routledge's pass, and Marvin Emnes doubled their advantage when he span . John O'Shea and blasted home with just 14 minutes gone. Fabio . Borini's 10th goal of the season five minutes after the restart gave . the Black Cats hope, but Wilfried Bony ensured his side left with all . the points with another fine strike. Job done: Poyet applauds the Sunderland crowd after keeping the Black Cats in the Premier League . Swans boss Garry Monk, who was taking charge of his first game since being appointed manager on a permanent basis, was delighted with a performance which ensured his side finished 12th. He knows his honeymoon period will have ended by the time the new campaign starts, but he is relishing the opportunity to test himself once again. Monk said: 'It's been great for me, this past three and a half months, or whatever it's been, has been a learning process and a taste of what is to come. 'But then I guess from next season, I will be judged more harshly on my own merits and every single move that I make. Relishing the opportunity: Swansea manager Garry Monk admits he will be judged more harshly next season . 'But I know that, I accept that and I'm not worried about that. It's how you have to live your life, so I am just looking forward to it. 'I am looking forward to being judged, being doubted. When you have got a point to prove and you have done that your whole career, there's nothing better than trying to prove people wrong.' Monk's first task could be to attempt to keep star men like Bony and Jonjo Shelvey out of the grasp of potential suitors, although that is not something he fears. He said: 'They will be an attraction for everyone. But we are lucky, we are in a position where we don't have to sell anyone, it's up to us.'","Gus Poyet confident he will still be Sunderland manager next season .

"A police dog has rescued a missing two-year-old girl a day after she wandered from her home in the bitter cold. Brooklyn Lilly walked up to the German shepherd as it approached her in a wooded area close to her home in Tawas City, Michigan around noon on Thursday, WNEM reported. The officer with the dog, assistant fire chief Jeffery Seyfried, wrapped up the cold and wet little girl in a sweater and carried her out of the woods, where she grinned for a photograph. Brooklyn suffered a scrape to her nose, blisters to her feet and was missing a boot but was otherwise happy and well when she was taken to be checked out at a local hospital. Safe: Brooklyn Lilly is grins after she was found in a woods near to her home by a police dog. She wandered away from her  home on Wednesday and was found 22 hours later with just a scrape to her nose . 'It was a rough night, but the moment that she was found was something special,' Seyfried told Mlive. 'She was bundled up in her jacket and when the team walked up to her, she started giggling. She actually told one of the guys that she loved it in the woods.' Brooklyn was last seen around 2.20pm on Wednesday when she somehow got out of her family's home while she was being looked after by a relative and wandered away. Authorities launched a massive search on foot and from the air, but police said they feared the worst as she had still not been found by nightfall, when temperatures plunged to 39F (3.8C). Fears: Brooklyn, left, was out in temperatures nearer freezing but survived overnight and was found by assistant fire chief Jeffery Seyfried, pictured right, an the dog from the Michigan State Police's K-9 unit . Heroic: The dog has not been named but was one of the 40 dogs working for the Michigan State Police, like the dog pictured above. As it looked for Brooklyn, the girl - who has grown up with dogs - approached it . 'With this type of weather and with this type of length of time, it was hinging on not good,' Iosco County Sheriff Al MacGregor told WNEM. 'We're very happy of the outcome of this.' Brooklyn had walked through a creek and was wet from the waist down when she was found three-quarters of a mile from her home, WNEM reported. Her mother, Tricia Cook, said that she had 'one strong little girl' and told the channel that the toddler has been enjoying a lot of pudding since she was found. The girl's aunt, Alecia Cook, added: 'It's amazing. We really didn't think it would happen. After searching for however long they've been out here it's just amazing that she's still healthy and OK.' The dog who helped find the toddler has not been identified but was one of 40 dogs in the state's K-9 unit. Scene: Troopers are pictured looking for Brooklyn before she was found miraculously safe and well . Relief: Search teams walk the search route on Thursday afternoon after she was found and taken to hospital . Saginaw police officer Douglas Stacer, who works closely with K-9 officers, said the bond between man and his dog made them a successful searching team. 'We read off each other,' he said. We've trained together, we live together, it's a partnership most people will never know. I know what he's thinking, he know's what I'm thinking,' Tawas City is in Iosco County, about 130 miles north of Detroit.

"Early reference: Scottish poet and novelist Sir Walter Scott wrote of the sound 'boo' in 1830 . It's the word most commonly associated with giving people a fright - and after extensive research it seems Scots can now claim it as their own. A new linguistics study has revealed that the word 'boo' is most likely to have originated in the country after its earliest reference was found in the religious works of two Scottish writers in the 18th century. Its first recorded use comes in the Scotch Presbyterian Eloquence Display'd, written by Gilbert Crokatt and John Monroe under the pseudonym of Jacob Curate in 1738. It is defined as 'a word that's used in the north of Scotland to frighten crying children'. Scots poet and novelist Sir Walter Scott also made reference to the sound in his series of essays titled Letters on Demonology and Witchcraft from 1830. He wrote 'we start and are afraid when we hear one cry Boh!' defining it as an 'an exclamation intended to surprise or frighten'. The Oxford English Dictionary (OED) says 'bo' or 'boh' comes from the sixteenth century, but its exact sense is not always clear. David Robinson, a linguist from Glasgow University, who works on the origins of English, said: 'There is a tendency to consider words like this as slang and unimportant, and not to trace their origins. 'The OED gives the etymology of ""bo"" as ""a combination of consonant and vowel especially fitted to produce a loud and startling sound"". 'However, different words are used in different languages - for example, French ghosts say ""hou"", so it should be possible to trace the origins of individual words. Scary: The 18th and 19th centuries were the heyday of ghost stories like Dickens' Christmas Carol, pictured . 'Since it appears that Scottish ghosts were the first to say ""boo"", it would be really interesting to find where this word came from. 'If it does come from the north of Scotland, then it might come from Gaelic. 'Gaelic ghosts do say boo, but we don't know if the Gaelic came from the Scots or the Scots from the Gaelic.' David added: 'There is very little data to go on. I'd be interested to know what Scots- or Gaelic-speaking ghosts from the 18th or 19th century would have to say about this.'","First reference appears in Scottish religious book published in 1738 .

"The Duchess of Cambridge was the first commoner to marry the heir to the throne in 350 years and is descended from coal miners, a road sweeper and even a prisoner. But new research into her family has revealed that the middle class princess has noble blood after all. A previously unknown branch of the Middleton's family tree shows Kate can count earls, countesses and even a Prime Minister among her ancestors. The Middleton family tree shows the Duchess of Cambridge is related to a Prime Minister as well as countesses and earls . The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge's child will be third in line to the throne . The Duchess welcomed the news about her ancestors when she was informed during the first . weeks of her pregnancy. Pupils in Melbourne, Australia, stumbled across the link during a genealogy project set by their teacher Michael Reed. The children were asked to research either the family tree of the Duchess, David Beckham or rapper 50 Cent using an online programme. It was soon discovered that the . Duchess was related to William Petty FitzMaurice, the 1st Marquess of . Lansdowne, whose ancestral seat Bowood House in Wiltshire is considered . one of Britain's best stately homes. He . served as Prime Minister between July 1782 and April 1783 during the . reign of George III and is remembered for negotiating the peace . settlement that ended the American War of Independence. Mr Reed said he embarked upon some . serious research when he realised while helping his pupils that there . was a connection between the Middletons and the Lupton family - a rich . and successful merchant and manufacturing family. Kate was the second cousin . three times removed of Barbara Lupton, who became Lady Bullock when she . married Sir Christopher Bullock. Sir . Christopher, a descendent of William Petty FitzMaurice, worked as . principal private secretary to Winston Churchill and later became . permanent under-secretary at the British Air Ministry. Illustrious: William Petty FitzMaurice served as Prime Minister during the reign of George III and negotiated the end of the American War of Independence and his ancestral seat Bowood House, right, which is considered one of the best stately homes in the country . The Duchess of Cambridge was sent a picture of her second cousin three times removed who became Lady Bullock when she married Sir Christopher Bullock, right . Mr Reed told The Sunday Times: 'Everyone has always made it clear Kate's a commoner so when I saw one of her cousins had a title I was surprised and intrigued.' The teacher contacted Edward, the surviving son of Sir Christopher and Lady Bullock who confirmed the connection. He also sent his findings to the Duchess, who thanked him for the research. Her assistant private secretary Rebecca Deacon wrote back on October 19, in the early stages of Kate's pregnancy, that the Duchess sent her best wishes and thanks to the teacher. Mr Reed told The Sunday Times: 'It is a good feeling to know that I've unearthed something that may be of interest to the Duchess, her family and the Royal family.' He traced the Duchess's family line back five generations to the Marquess of Lansdowne and his brother Thomas FitzMaurice who lived at the Buckinghamshire stately home Cliveden with his wife Mary, 4th Countess of Orkney in the late 18th century. William Bortrick, the chairman of Burke's Peerage, said it will make an 'interesting inclusion' in the next edition of the guide, which will be published after the Duchess gives birth.","Australian teacher Michael Reed and his pupils found link between the Middleton family and a former Prime Minister .

"Two former Apple employees have revealed the gruelling work hours they endured at the technology company - including being on call 24 hours a day. Former managers Don Melton and Nitin Ganatra have claimed they could only go to the toilet on Sunday nights while their manager watched The Sopranos and that every Sunday was a work night. In a podcast interview with Debug, the pair discussed work habits at the American technology giant. Scroll down for video . Apple's former internet technologies director, Don Melton, has revealed details about the gruelling work hours he endured while working for the technology company . Apple's former internet technologies director Melton said Sunday nights became even worse after The Sopranos ended because they could no longer take a break. 'For a while there, you could count on the hour that The Sopranos was on that Scott [Forstall] wouldn't bug you because he was watching The Sopranos. And that was your reprieve. You could go to the bathroom, you could have a conversation with your family,' he said. Melton described how his boss would work until 2am on a Sunday - while revealing that the new Apple CEO Tim Cook is just as dedicated. 'When you hear the so-called apocryphal stories about Tim Cook coming to work in the wee hours and staying late, it's not just some PR person telling you stories to make you think that Apple executives work really hard like that. They really do that. I mean, these people are nuts. They're just, they are there all the time,' he said. Both Melton and Nitin Ganatra (left) , the former director of iOS apps, were on call 24 hours a day and couldn't got to the bathroom until their boss was safely watching The Sopranos . Cook joined Apple in March 1998 as Senior Vice President (SVP) of Worldwide Operations and was named the CEO of Apple on August 24, 2011, when he succeeded Steve Jobs. Six weeks later, on October 5, 2011, Jobs died due to complications from a relapse of his previously treated pancreatic cancer. Melton has described Apple as 'like working in a nuclear power plant, but you don't get one of those protective suits.' In his worrying analogy he said that if you didn't learn to survive it you would die. Former director of iOS apps Ganatra conceded that the bosses were 'intense'. Both men described their boss Tim Cook (right) who succeeded Steve Jobs (left), as 'intense' and 'nuts' due to his constant hard work and dedication . 'They're looking for the answers, you have the answer, and you cannot get the answer to them soon enough,' he said in agreement. A year after his retirement in 2012, Melton previously wrote on his own blog: 'It's not like other folks there weren't working nights and weekends too. Many of my engineers worked longer and harder than I did. It was a busy place. By our choice. But I don't miss any of the work.' On September 19, Apple unveiled its iPhone 6 and Cook declared it was Apple's 'best launch ever'. A record 10 million new iPhones were sold over the opening weekend, however buyers have since complained of problems with the bigger-screen handsets.","Former Apple managers Don Melton and Nitin Ganatra said every Sunday night was a work night .

Pournazarian was diagnosed with the rare condition at just six months old. 'I am so, so, so excited to be able to help my friend,' Siegel said. 'I am thankful to the people everywhere for letting me share my story and inspire kids to change the world.' Dylan became concerned about Jonah when he found out researchers were almost out of funding to conduct studies into the disease, an hereditary liver disorder that means the liver can store sugar but cannot release it, causing dangerously low blood sugar levels that can result in death.

Mr Florin (left) and Mr Ion (right) say they have both been in the UK for three months and plan on staying until Christmas, before returning home to Romania . A notice has now been taped near onto a tree near the entrance of the camp, explaining that Transport for London - which owns the patch of land - will be taking the case to court on Friday . The makeshift camp  has been set up in woodland next to the Lee Park Way canal in Edmonton, north London and has sparked anger among local residents . Those living at the site - believed to be mainly from Romania - have created the set-up out of discarded timber, pallets and tents, pictured . The migrants, believed to be mainly men, are sleeping inside the huts and tents and are believed to have been there for at least six months . Marian Dumitrache, 30, from Buzau, Romania, left his home country six months ago to work in London – sending money home to his wife and two young children in the city. Wearing a Superman sweatshirt, he took a break from his house decorating job in nearby Chingford to claim he has ‘no choice’ but to live in the camp. It is already at the centre of a row as many residents in nearby Edmonton view the shacks as a ‘filthy slum’ where migrants cook on open fires, wash in the canal and use the woods as a toilet. Yesterday the Daily Mail was invited to tour the site by 30-year-old Roma gipsy Marian Dumitrache, who revealed how up to six migrants sleep in a room on bare mattresses and sit outside among makeshift tables, armchairs and abandoned shopping trolleys. Mr Dumitrache left his native Romania six months ago to work in London – sending money home to his wife and two young children in the city of Buzau. Wearing a Superman sweatshirt, he took a break from his house decorating job in nearby Chingford to claim he has ‘no choice’ but to live in the camp. ‘No one likes the Roma gipsy. Living here is cold and uncomfortable but at least I can earn money painting and send that home. ‘But we are not living off other people or the state. The camp is deserted today because people are at work.’ He added: ‘We cook on camp fires and some people use the canal to wash. We are not really living here – we just about exist. It is very cold at night. We have no gas or electricity.’ Mr Dumitrache confirmed that Transport for London – which owns the land – had issued eviction papers and the police have served Asbos on individuals. High Court documents also refer to the discovery of stolen car number plates and beer kegs on the site in recent months and of the health and safety concerns involving some 40 men living in the newly-erected suburban shanty town. The Eastern Europeans in the camp come from Romania, Bulgaria and Poland. Mr Dumitrache entered Britain six months ago by car after showing his Romanian identity card to border officials. Police have spent the past few weeks regularly visiting the site asking the men to move. But the camp remains, and locals are angry that more has not been done to move them on. One said: ‘It’s a joke, nobody wants to live near a filthy slum.’ River Lea Anglers’ Club secretary John Weighell added: ‘It stinks to high heaven and you can see garbage hanging in the trees and bushes. It looks like a shanty town in Soweto or Rio. They are destroying the wildlife, intimidating the public and causing a nuisance.’ The illegal camps have been set up on land owned by Transport for London which said it is aware of the situation and is taking 'relevant legal action' Residents have complained that the camp is blighting the landscape and even affecting wildlife. One angler said two swans and their dozen signets have disappeared from the river since the migrants' arrival . River Lea Anglers' Club secretary John Weighell said it 'stinks to high-heaven' and looks like 'a shanty town in Soweto or Rio' Washing lines have been installed in the area, while garbage, clothes and plastic bags hang from the trees. There is no running water or electricity on site . Those who have set up the camp have created a makeshift living room, using an arm chair and a pouffe as a coffee table . Two trolleys are pictured on site, one filled with rubbish. Residents have complained that the site is loaded with rubbish and has led to the usually serene atmosphere being destroyed . The 'houses' on camp are kept secure with padlocks (right) and are believed to have led to an increase in rubbish around the area (left) The woodland sits alongside the canal in Upper Edmonton, pictured, which residents say is iconic among walkers, boaters and anglers . Pub landlord Shane Kilcrann, who runs the Old Hall Tavern in Chingford, added: ‘It will turn into a mini Calais. This is not the way we live, it’s inhumane and unhealthy.’ At least one local said the migrants ‘seem to keep their area quite clean’. However, Enfield police claim there is evidence that members of the public have been harassed and intimidated by the men, who occupy three separate camp areas. Detective Chief Inspector Paul Healy said anti-social behaviour is a ‘significant and persistent problem’ on the site. He said they have enlisted the help of two Romanian officers to work out why migrants were flocking to Edmonton and to help prevent other such sites from being developed. TfL has vowed that the group will be issued with a date next week for a new court eviction hearing.’","Migrants are living in ramshackle huts made from wood, timber and pallets in woodland near canal in Edmonton .

"Former New York mayor Michael Bloomberg has been made an honorary knight by Queen Elizabeth II. The 72-year-old businessman and politician's new title will be Michael Bloomberg, Honorary Knight of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire (KBE). Billionaire Bloomberg, who owns a $19.2million home in London's upmarket Knightsbridge, will not be travelling to Buckingham Palace to meet the Queen, but said he was 'deeply honored'. Sir Michael (sort of) : Businessman and former New York mayor Michael Bloomberg has been made a Honorary Knight of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire . Mr Bloomberg has been awarded the honorary knighthood for his 'prodigious entrepreneurial and philanthropic endeavors, and the many ways in which they have benefited the United Kingdom and the UK-US special relationship', the British Embassy in Washington said in a statement. As a foreign national Mr Bloomberg will be made an honorary knight, and will therefore not be Sir Michael Bloomberg, but can, if he wishes, add KBE to the end of his name. Non-British nationals can receive honorary awards awards for their important contribution to British interests. 'As Mayor of New York, as a businessman, and as a philanthropist, Mike Bloomberg has played a key role in forging transatlantic diplomatic, economic, and cultural ties,' British Ambassador to the United States Sir Peter Westmacott said today. Big fan: Bloomberg  will not be travelling to Buckingham Palace to meet the Queen, but said he was 'deeply honored' to be awarded a knighthood . 'He has made a significant contribution to British business life through his firm, Bloomberg L.P., and the impact of his considerable philanthropic endeavours in the arts and education is felt by Britons every day. Upon accepting the title, Mr. Bloomberg said: 'I am deeply honored to receive this recognition, which is especially meaningful to me because of my close personal, business, and philanthropic ties to London and Britain, which stretch back four decades. 'Over those years it has been a great privilege to work with British leaders on a wide variety of issues, and to invest - commercially, culturally, and civically - in the future of Britain, a place I have long considered my second home.' As Mayor of New York, Mr Bloomberg got on famously well with London Mayor Boris Johnson the pair worked together to boost travel between the UK capital and NYC. Mr Bloomberg, a self-confessed anglophile, is a 'great supporter of the arts and education in Britain' and committed more than £42.4 million in philanthropic support to the UK.

"Han Solo from Star Wars was frozen in suspended animation for transport, but now scientists hope to perform surgery by 'freezing' patients . It sounds like something out of Star Wars - doctors are attempting to save the lives of ten patients by putting them in ‘suspended animation’, when they are neither alive or dead. Surgeons at UPMC Presbyterian Hospital in Pittsburgh will cool down the patients so their blood cells need less oxygen to survive. While the body is in this state, the team will work to fix the 'structural problems' caused by a blade or a bullet. The trial will take place later this month and the surgeons are already on call at the hospital, primed for when a suitable patient arrives. Because the patients will be unable to give consent to the procedure, researchers have been running a publicity campaign to allow potential patients to opt out. Locals have been able to order bracelets to indicate that they don’t consent. The procedure - which has been likened to what happened to Han Solo in the Star Wars movie Empire Strikes Back -  will see all of the patients’ blood being replaced with cold saline solution, meaning their bodies will quickly cool to 10C and almost all cellular activity will stop. ‘We are suspending life, but we don't like to call it suspended animation because it sounds like science fiction,’ Samuel Tisherman, a surgeon at the hospital, told New Scientist. ‘So we call it emergency preservation and resuscitation.’ Peter Rhee at the University of Arizona added: ‘If a patient comes to us two hours after dying you can't bring them back to life. 'But if they're dying and you suspend them, you have a chance to bring them back after their structural problems have been fixed.' It has long been known that there are benefits to cooling the bodies of some severely injured people. When the body is at its normal temperature, cells need a strong supply of oxygen, meaning that if the heart stops beating, the person will die rapidly. However, if the body temperature has been reduced, less oxygen is required, buying doctors time to save the patient. Previously, cooling of a body has been used during some operations but this involves circulating the blood through a cooling system. The study is a feasibility and safety study designed to see if hypothermia is beneficial. In EPR, body temperature is lowered to about 50ºF (10ºC) by administering a large volume of cold fluid through a large tube, called a cannula, placed into the aorta, which is the largest artery in the body. A heart-lung bypass machine would be used to restore blood circulation and oxygenation as part of the resuscitation process. The study will be conducted at the University of Pittsburgh and the University of Maryland. This is not an option in emergency medicine as it takes too long. As a result, doctors had to find a method of cooling the body much more quickly. In 2002 researchers at the University of Michigan tested a new technique on pigs. The creatures were sedated and then subjected to massive blood loss before their blood was replaced by cold saline solution. Once the pigs had been cooled to 10C, their injuries were repaired and they were warmed up again. A cell in suspended animation. Doctors face the challenge of freezing human cells without causing damage . The saline solution was replaced by their blood. The researchers noted that in most of the pigs, the hearts started again naturally and they suffered no long-term ill effects. The medics are now ready to try the technique on humans. However, they will need the right patient. Surgeons at UPMC Presbyterian Hospital, in Pittsburgh, will cool down the patients so their blood cells need less oxygen to survive. It will have to be someone whose heart has stopped as a result of an injury and who cannot be successful revived using traditional techniques. Their body temperature will be reduced in just 15 minutes, they will temporarily have no blood in their system and they will not be breathing or have any brain activity. Technically, they will be dead. The doctors hope that the patients will then revive naturally but if they do not then they will be resuscitated.","U.S. medics developing the technique to buy time in treating lethal wounds .

"A 67-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of historical child abuse following an investigation into claims of a paedophile ring with links to Downing Street. The unnamed suspect was held in Dorset yesterday and questioned at a local police station before being released last night, Scotland Yard said.

A man has been arrested by police investigating claims, raised by MP Tom Watson (pictured, right), that a paedophile ring had links to Number 10 Downing Street (left, file photo) In 2012, he used Prime Minister's Questions to claim that a file of evidence used to convict a man called Peter Righton of importing child pornography in 1992 contained 'clear intelligence' of a paedophile gang. He also claimed that a member of the group had bragged about links with a senior aide to a former Prime Minister. Mr Watson wrote to Scotland Yard about the case, and the force later launched a number of separate criminal investigations after assessing the information. A spokesman for the Metropolitan Police said: 'A 67-year-old man has been arrested this morning, Tuesday, 14 October, at an address in Dorset on suspicion of historical child abuse offences. 'He was taken into custody locally and has now been released on police bail to a date in late November pending further inquiries.

"Football never ceases to amaze in the improbable scenarios it can throw up. What goes around... comes around. Liverpool took a financial hit of £35million when they let Andy Carroll and Stewart Downing go to West Ham back in August. Both were expensive acquisitions who failed to make the grade at Anfield and, with better options available, Liverpool decided to cut their losses. Now, the two rejected ones could repay that lost money by helping the Hammers to a win over champions-elect Manchester City on Sunday and deliver the title to Merseyside for the first time in 24 years.

The England frontman was tipped for great things when Liverpool splashed out £35million for his services in January 2011. As . he arrived from Newcastle, Fernando Torres moved through the exit door . in his British record £50million move and Kenny Dalglish clearly . believed it was sound business. Bright beginnings: There were high hopes for Andy Carroll when he joined Liverpool from Newcastle for £35m in January 2011 . On target: Carroll celebrates with Luis Suarez after scoring against Merseyside rivals Everton in the FA Cup semi-final at Wembley . But plagued by injuries, he struggled to make much impression at Anfield and made just nine appearances that season. His first goals for Liverpool did come against Manchester City, perhaps a little omen for Sunday. In . all, Carroll scored 11 goals in 58 outings for Liverpool, a below . average return for the amount of money invested in him, and when Brendan . Rodgers came in promising to restore free-flowing football, the writing . was on the wall. More of a . battering ram striker, Carroll was simply not compatible with Rodgers' vision of the 'Liverpool Way' and a loan spell at Upton Park was made . permanent in August 2013. That's better: Carroll has performed better at West Ham since his move despite an injury-plagued season . With . Luis Suarez hitting top form and Daniel Sturridge later joining from . Chelsea, Liverpool were quite prepared to take a £20m loss on Carroll. Downing . was bought from Aston Villa for £20million in the summer of 2011. The . winger, an established England international, was ready to make the step . up to a side that could challenge for the title and compete in the . Champions League. He won the . League Cup in his first season at Anfield, and was man of the match in . the final, but he finished the Premier League season with no goals and . no assists.

The following . campaign didn't see an improvement in his fortunes and Downing . contributed just five goals and nine assists in 45 appearances, . ultimately losing his place in the England team. Again, . Rodgers saw that better options were available and, once again deciding . to take a hit on the decisions of a previous regime, sold him to West . Ham for just £5million.

'I think the B league, however it is formed, is something that is very important to give young players that competitive football.' Tottenham boss Tim Sherwood was also in favour of Dyke's controversial proposal. He said: ‘It’s the way forward. Other countries have shown that.

Robert Smith QC, representing News UK, said: ‘It is submitted that the allegations against News UK on the basis of apparently reliable evidence produced during the trial, News UK had failed to displace after being given a proper opportunity to do so. ‘The fact nevertheless remains that we would like to bring to the court’s attention the sheer scale of that exercise which has troubled us, your lordship, throughout. ‘It is following that that News UK have indicated that they have not felt willing to engage in an exercise which involves addressing these issues in these proceedings. ‘The end result is that News UK would not seek or accept any part of any order by way of costs from central funds, public funds or however one wishes to express it.’ Jonathan Laidlaw QC, representing Brooks, 46, said she had already made clear she did not intend to recover her personal expenses incurred during the case. Long trial: Brooks was acquitted of being part of the hacking conspiracy along with her former personal assistant Cheryl Carter (left), 50, and News International head of security Mark Hanna (right), 51 . He told the court: ‘Having been the beneficiary of an indemnity for her legal costs from News, as my learned friend Mr Smith has correctly indicated, any monies which would have been the subject of a claims case order would have automatically gone to News to compensate them for the financial support they were good enough to afford to her during her trial. ‘I formally withdraw the application on her behalf. Mrs Brooks has already indicated that she was not seeking and did not wish to recover her personal expenses for the trial from the public purse.’ Her husband, Charlie Brooks, 51, and retired managing editor Stuart Kuttner, 74, were also found not guilty of being part of the hacking conspiracy, which dates back to 2000, but are continuing to seek their costs, the court heard. Racehorse trainer Charlie Brooks, who attended the hearing, is seeking ballpark costs of £600,000, the court heard. Continuing to seek their costs: Brooks's husband, Charlie Brooks (left), 51, and retired managing editor Stuart Kuttner (right), 74, whow ere also found not guilty of being part of the hacking conspiracy . Jonathan Caplan QC, representing Kuttner, said he paid out ‘from his own pocket a little less than £135,000’ until News UK indemnified him from January 2013 onwards. Rebekah Brooks was cleared of hacking, conspiracy to commit misconduct in a public office for allegedly signing off payments to a Sun journalist’s ‘number one military contact’ between 2004 and 2012, conspiracy to pervert the course of justice and perverting the course of justice. Her husband was found not guilty of perverting the course of justice around the time of police searches in July 2011, while Kuttner was also cleared of hacking. Carter was found not guilty of perverting the course of justice by removing seven boxes from the NI archive days before she was arrested in 2011 while Hanna was cleared of perverting the course of justice around the time of police searches in July 2011. The court heard that prosecutors may have been led to believe their case was stronger than it was by how the defendants behaved both before and after their arrest. Mr Caplan said the answer to this in respect of Kuttner was a ‘resounding no’. Decision: News International has dropped an application for costs incurred in relation to the multimillion-pound phone hacking trial of Mrs Brooks and her staff. The firm's old offices in Wapping, east London, are pictured . ‘Mr Kuttner was one of the few who gave full answers to very lengthy interview sessions with police,’ he said. He also pointed out that Kuttner had alerted police to a message on murdered schoolgirl Milly Dowler’s mobile phone, not realising that the method of obtaining the information - though phone hacking - may have constituted a crime. Neil Saunders, representing Charlie Brooks, said his actions ‘may have been unwise, but not criminal’. Referring to the fact that Mr Brooks answered ‘no comment’ when questioned by police, Mr Saunders said: ‘He clearly brought suspicion on himself. But it has to be something more than a ‘no comment’.’ Ahead of listening to the legal argument, the judge, Mr Justice Saunders, told the court to remember that the defendants had been cleared by a jury. ‘I have the greatest respect for the system and the greatest respect for the jury’s decision in this case and nothing under discussion should be seen as going against this,’ he said. ‘The defendants have been found innocent.’ The judge is expected to announce his ruling on the costs application tomorrow.","Ex-NotW editor acquitted of being part of hacking conspiracy after trial .

"Lewis Hamilton made it four pole positions in five races this season as he again left Mercedes team-mate Nico Rosberg trailing. With Mercedes again proving to be way ahead of their rivals, Hamilton finished 0.168 seconds ahead of Rosberg as the all-conquering force in Formula One again locked out the front row of the Spanish Grand Prix grid. As long as he keeps his nose clean, Hamilton is likely to win Sunday’s race after a brilliant performance in qualifying.

For all the talk of upgrades to the . cars of rivals at the opportunity offered by the first race of the . European stage of the season, Mercedes have seemingly maintained their . significant advantage over the rest. Nobody can live with them: Daniel Ricciardo, of Red Bull, was third fastest, a full second back from Hamilton. ‘I’m . very disappointed,’ said Rosberg. ‘I don’t particularly like coming . second to Lewis. I did a good lap but he did a better job.’ There . is a danger, implicit in what Rosberg said, that Hamilton can waltz to . his second world title. He has won three of the four races, the only . blip being a technical malfunction at the opening round in Melbourne. Close: Nico Rosberg finished just behind Hamilton as Mercedes locked up the front row . Rosberg . won that race and was runner-up at the next three, meaning that he . takes a four-point lead into today’s race in Barcelona. Hamilton . has not led the standings since he did so fleetingly in 2012. ‘That was . my one small taste of leading the championship for some time, but . otherwise I don’t remember the last time,’ he said. ‘As . long as you’re leading when you cross the finish line at the last race, . that’s what counts. But it’s my goal to get in front and stay there.’ Hamilton . accomplished his pole position feat despite having problems with his . machinery. He came on the radio to say: ‘I don’t know how but we’ve made . the car worse.’ Impressive: Red Bull driver Daniel Ricciardo completed the top three in Montmelo . Disappointing: Sebastian Vettel failed to set a time in Q3 at Circuit de Catalunya after stopping on track . He later . explained: ‘In practice we had such a great car and often when things . are that good you don’t want to change much. But we changed a few things . over night in the hope of making things a little bit better – small . things, like half a millimetre here and there. ‘But today they car was a real handful.’ The . same could be said of the world champion, Sebastian Vettel. The gearbox . of his Red Bull failed, condemning him to start 10th and adding to a . season of woe. How he must be irked by the performances of his team-mate . Ricciardo. ‘I'm quite disappointed,’ said Vettel. It . was a dismal day, too, for McLaren. Jenson Button was eighth fastest – . impressive in the circumstances – and his rookie team-mate Kevin .

"Frost is on the way and tender plants are exhausted. It's time to clear the wreckage and hunker down for winter. But this is not the end. The new gardening year starts now — if you want gorgeous beds and containers for Easter, you need to plant them as soon as possible. Unlike summer planting, colour won't be instant, but that will make the flowers even more welcome when they do appear. If you visit a garden centre this weekend, you may be disappointed at the lack of colour, but don't be put you off. Tiptoe through the tulips: The spectacular spring display at Great Dixter, East Sussex . See if you can find forget-me-nots, wallflowers, spring daisies or primulas — all low-key now, but full of promise. Bulbs look even less exciting, but there will be masses on sale, from tiny scillas to huge crown imperials. SLOW BURNERS . Winter containers and beds are a slow burn. They look green and unexciting during the darkest months, but colour will appear gradually. Wallflowers are brilliant for that. If planting them in pots with tulips, choose compact varieties such as Prince Mix. For larger beds, plant tall ones such as dark-red Vulcan or Thompson & Morgan's Most Scented mix. Forget-me-nots are essential. If you allowed them to naturalise last year, there should be self-sown plants begging to be transplanted to your containers. They will create an intense blue mist in April and blend beautifully with tulips. Choose primroses carefully. Modern ones can be garish, but older primulas, such as dark-leaved, lilac-flowered Guinevere, look wonderful in pots. Oxlips also thrive in containers, and flower from March to May. Team them with grape hyacinths or tulips. BAGS OF BULBS . Bulbs are the backbone of spring displays. You can use big ones such as hyacinths to make bold splashes of colour or dot little ones among other plants to extend the interest. Though fine on their own, bulbs look better among leafy plants. And since they can be removed after blooming, you can plant for a succession of flowers from midwinter to May. Snowdrops and varieties of Iris reticulata flower from early February and can precede crocuses or muscari. But tulips are the top bulbs for the spring climax. If they are to grow on their own, choose short-stemmed ones, such as tan orange Prinses Irene and double-flowered Eternal Flame. Team taller kinds — such as scarlet Apeldoorn, soft-pink Valentine or two-tone Tequila Sunrise — with forget-me-nots or harmonising wallflowers. Big daffodils may be too lanky for containers, but the compact narcissus varieties do magnificently. Try pale yellow, late-flowering Hawera with winter pansies, or dot white-and-lemon Jack Snipe among the primulas. Bulbs are some of a gardener's best purchases. After using them for bedding displays or containers, you can then replant them elsewhere in your garden. Then, with no more effort, they'll give you years of service. That surely makes them the best possible bargains among spring flowers.","If you want gorgeous beds for Easter, you need to plant  as soon as possible .

"Bernie Ecclestone has led the tributes to John Button, the father of the 2009 Formula One world champion Jenson and one of motor racing’s most popular figures, who has been found dead at his home on the French Riviera. He was 70. It was only six months ago that champagne glasses clinked in celebration of the man Jenson called ‘Papa Smurf’ reaching his landmark birthday, and he had seemed in good health at the annual Autosport Awards gala dinner in December. But in a statement Jenson Button’s agent said: ‘It is with great sadness and regret that I can confirm John Button passed away at his home in the South of France on Sunday. Jenson Button celebrating his 2009 world championship title with his father John after the Brazilian Grand Prix . ‘Whilst we await confirmation, . initial signs would indicate a suspected heart attack. A close friend . who was visiting John on Sunday was the first to discover the tragic . news. ‘John's children . Jenson, Natasha, Samantha and Tanya and the rest of the family are . clearly devastated and ask for their privacy to be respected during this . extremely difficult time.’ Ecclestone, . Formula One’s supremo, spoke for the paddock family after the news . broke on Monday afternoon, saying: ‘As with most people, I suspect, I . was surprised to see that we lost John Button. He is someone that I have . known for over 40 years and is one of those people that you always . expect to see at a Formula One race. I will certainly miss him.’ Tribute: Bernie Ecclestone, pictured left with John Button in 2009, says he will miss Jenson's Button's father . John Button was a near ever-present attendee at F1 races, wearing . headphones to follow the radio exchanges during practice, qualifying and . grands prix. He was addicted to motorsport, and was himself runner-up . in the RAC British Rallycross Championship in 1976. He . wanted more for his son. So much so that he was occasionally left with . empty pockets. While traipsing back from Scotland with Jenson's kart . tied on the back of his old Transit van, John had to borrow money for . the petrol to get them home to Frome, Somerset. The . ultimate reward came for John, who was wearing a pink shirt as he did . superstitiously every Sunday for a race, when Jenson won the world title . in Brazil five years ago. Gong: Button, with his parents John and Simone, receiving an MBE following his title triumph . Winner: John Button celebrates his son's win at the 2012 Australian Grand Prix, and right, with Jenson's girlfriend Jessica Michibata strolling the paddock ahead of the season-opening race in Bahrain back in 2010 . Their . mission was complete and that night John danced away in his son's . private celebration party at a Sao Paulo nightclub. It is a comfort to . think that he probably considered everything that came after that as a . bonus. Some fathers can be pushy but John learned to place himself . unobtrusively in the background. He was always there with Jenson but not in the way. Jenson . was appreciative of the hardships his father had endured as he rose . through the karting ranks, and, when he was rich enough to provide for . him, made sure his old man lived and travelled in comfort. John's . place on the Riviera was close to Jenson's own. Where he once drove a . petrol-deficient Transit, John relished the Ferrari he always took to . the Italian Grand Prix, its great engine shaking the Hotel della Regione . in Monza when he struck it up. He . often had a glass of something red – or, alternatively, something white . – in his hand. His ready smile and leathery face conveyed conviviality . to all. He loved journeying around the world and was particularly . excited to see Formula One return to America in 2012. He . got to the States especially early to reconnoitre the best restaurants . and bars in Austin, and delightedly passed on the tips to the rest of . us. Flying the flag: Button celebrates his maiden victory with his father at the 2006 Hungarian Grand Prix . The affection in . which he was held was summed up by Martin Whitmarsh, the McLaren team . principal, who said: 'I want to say how very sad I was to hear the news . of John's passing. 'In . my long Formula One career, I've encountered many drivers' fathers, but . I think it's safe to say that John was perhaps more devoted to his son . than any of them. Ever since Jenson was a boy, racing go-karts, his dad . has been at his side, helping him, supporting him, finding the money for . the next race. 'As Jenson grew older, and continued to win in cars, still John was always there, his most steadfast helper and supporter. 'And, . even now, in recent years, during which Jenson has become the . consummate Formula One world champion that he is, the most experienced . driver on the grid in fact, still John has been ever-present, as loyal . and as loving as ever, a benign and popular member of Jenson's small and . intimate entourage. Face of the paddock: John Button was an ever-present during his son's Formula One career . 'This . coming season will be Jenson's fifth as a McLaren driver. I believe . John has attended every grand prix over the past four seasons, and over . that period he's become a unique and, I think it's fair to say, . irreplaceable part of the McLaren ""family"". 'He . was a great dad, but also a lovely man, and he'll be enormously missed . by Jenson, of course, by all at McLaren, and indeed by the Formula One . community at large.' Typically, . John was looking forward to the coming season. The last time I saw him – . at the Autosport Awards – he upbraided me for criticising McLaren's . failings next season. Loyal to Whitmarsh and hoping for the best for his . son, he said: 'Don't you worry, next season we'll be fine.' Everyone in the paddock, starting with poor Jenson, of course, is simply sorry he won't be around to see it unfold. 'Deeply saddened by the passing of John Button. I'm so sorry Jenson Button, John was such a great man and will be missed by so many. God bless'Lewis Hamilton . 'Very sad to here about John Button. Always such a happy and cheerful man around the sport we all love. Thoughts are with the Button family. He will not be forgotten.'Paul Di Resta .

"Rickie Lambert should be on the World Cup plane to Brazil to give England an edge from the penalty spot and also provide a Plan B in support of Wayne Rooney, according to former captain Alan Shearer. Three Lions boss Roy Hodgson is set to name his squad for the finals on Monday following the end to the Barclays Premier League season. Although Rooney will miss the chance to come up against Southampton forward Lambert at St Mary's on Sunday because of a minor groin problem, the Manchester United striker is expected to once again lead England's attack on the big stage this summer. Frontman: Alan Shearer says Rickie Lambert (centre) should be in England's World Cup squad . Just who will offer support remains to be seen - with the likes of United team-mate Danny Welbeck and Liverpool forward Daniel Sturridge also in the frame, while West Ham frontman Andy Carroll could offer another choice as would Jermain Defoe, now playing in the Major Soccer League with Toronto. However, Shearer - who spearheaded a formidable front partnership with Teddy Sheringham in the run to the semi-finals of Euro 96 and also played at the 199 World Cup - believes Lambert would provide a cool head were the dreaded penalty shoot-out to stand the way of England's progress once more this summer. 'One of the reasons I would take Rickie Lambert is for that eventuality - how important have penalties been for England at major tournaments in the last 25 years?' said Shearer, who will be in Brazil as part of the BBC's World Cup coverage. Support act: Daniel Sturridge (left) and Danny Welbeck are in the frame to play alongside Wayne Rooney . 'Lambert's record from penalties for Southampton is amazing, but I would take him to Brazil on merit for his overall contribution. 'To have him on your team, knowing that if it goes to a shoot-out he is a virtual banker, is a great feeling for a coach. 'In open play, if we are struggling to score, he is a great option to have - he came on and scored with his first touch in international football against Scotland at Wembley, and that is a decent knack to have. Prolific: Lambert (left) has never missed a penalty for Southampton, scoring 34 out of 34 . 'My four picks as forwards would be Rooney, Sturridge, Welbeck and Lambert. 'You don't need to play for one of the top four to get a game for England now - look at all the Southampton players who are in contention.' Shearer believes a sense of realism might actually allow England to play with a freedom when for once the expectations of a nation will not weigh heavy on the 'Golden Generation'. 'I am sick of us coming away from a World Cup, after so many of our players have had great seasons for their clubs, wondering why England have not done themselves justice,' he said. Brazil-bound: Alan Shearer (left) is part of the BBC's television team for the World Cup this summer . 'This time, I don't think many people expect us to do well, and that might work in our favour. 'I just wish an England side could come home from a big tournament and say, truthfully, they gave every last drop. 'It would be great to see (Raheem) Sterling or Lallana have a great World Cup, something where we could see we are on the right track, people at home will accept that.'","England legend Shearer says Lambert deserves a place on the plane to Brazil this summer .

"A couple who were reported missing by police have been arrested for speeding through suburban streets and crashing into motorists - with their newborn son on board. Ashley Groizard, 20, and Michael Holman, 32, sparked a police search after disappearing with their son from the Hunter Valley in NSW, and were found by authorities after being involved in a car crash over 600km away in Warwick, Queensland. The three-month-old boy was taken to hospital following the incident, while his parents appeared in the Warwick Magistrates Court on Wednesday. Groizard and Holman faced charges relating to driving and drug offences including evading police, wilful damage, dangerous operation of a motor vehicle, possessing a dangerous drug, and driving under the influence of drugs. Scroll down for video . Ashley Groizard, 20, leaving Warwick Magistrates Court on Wednesday after being charged with multiple offences including driving under the influence of drugs . The Abedare couple were assessed by a mental health worker following their arrest on Tuesday night. Both Groizard and Holman were found to be suffering from indications of psychosis and paranoia, and have been ordered by the court to submit to psychiatric testing, reported Australian Regional Media. The couple were allegedly under the influence of methylamphetamines when they allegedly drove on the wrong side of the road over the speed limit, rear-ended a vehicle, ran several red lights and hit a motorist at 8pm. Officers found the vehicle at the scene, at the intersection of Dragon and Bracker St. Holman was allegedly aggressive toward the motorist and police, Warwick Patrol Group Acting Inspector Stewart Day said.

Holman (left) and Groizard (right) were reported missing by family, sparking a public appeal my NSW Police . 'The male passenger alighted from the vehicle with a cricket bat and (allegedly) damaged the other vehicle,' he said. 'When police arrived he threatened to assault police and officers drew their tasers and told him to stop. He did and the tasers weren't used.' The alleged car crash victim said the pair started honking her and began tailgating her vehicle 'aggressively', before rear-ending her, causing her vehicle into a tailspin. 'My car spun and at one point I was facing them - I could see them and the car was still spinning and then they drove off,' she told Australian Regional Media. 'I was scared but at the same time I was just glad I was OK.' The unidentified woman expressed concern for the family, and said that when she later heard sirens she was worried they might have injured themselves or other motorists. 'I just wondered who they had crashed into now and hoped they hadn't hurt some family just trying to get home,' she said. 'And I hoped they were OK too - I didn't want them to get hurt either.' NSW Police launched a public appeal on Tuesday to find the pair and their three-month-old son, after being reported missing by family on Monday. Both Groizard and Holman have been told to remain in police custody and the couple will appear before the Warwick Magistrates Court again on November 10.

"Deep in to added time, Manuel Pellegrini was offered his Roberto Mancini moment. One chance for salvation, Sergio Aguero’s right foot. You know the story. If this wasn’t quite an instant to match that of Manchester City’s title winning moment against QPR of May 2012, it was certainly one to stir the soul in similar fashion. In football – in sport – there is nothing quite like a contest that swings in the closing moments. As he moves forwards, though, Pellegrini may realise that the similarities to Mancini’s day in the spring sunshine do not quite end with the score line and the name of the winning goal scorer. Manuel Pellegrini shares a moment with counterpart Pep Guardiola after being handed a lifeline . Aguero is mobbed by team-mates after firing City ahead in the dying seconds to complete a remarkable win . Aguero blasts City to their first Premier League title against QPR two years ago . For just as Mancini failed to capitalise on that amazing day two-and-half years ago, so Pellegrini must ensure that he does. This was magnificent, stomach-churning stuff. City needed it. English teams in Europe needed it. It will, however, mean absolutely nothing if Pellegrini and his hopelessly aimless team cannot capitalise, if they cannot use the adrenaline and the emotion of the experience to go on to better things. Mancini’s City team got worse after winning the league. Pellegrini’s side must get better quickly if this season is to amount to anything at all over the next six months. Aguero was scintillating. When isn’t he? Both of the opportunities he was afforded by calamitous Bayern Munich errors were perhaps 50-50 in terms of the probability of a goal. The first one was the most important – without the first there is no second – and that was the most difficult. Aguero levels for City to give them a Champions League lifeline... and better was to come at the Etihad . Aguero skips between Franck Ribery and Robert Lewandowski as the Argentina striker put in a dazzling display . The very best centre forwards, perhaps the top five per cent, have the ability almost to stop time when presented with opportunities that may frighten the life out of lesser sportsmen. Like leading golfers standing over six-foot putts, the idea of missing is simply alien to then. Here, on both occasions, there was a tangible calmness about the way that the Argentine advanced towards goal and executed, Two chances, two goals. Only the very best can do that and Aguero belongs in that category. That apart, though, there was very little to cheer here for Pellegrini and City. On the whole, this was another lamentable night for a team stuck in quick sand both domestically and in Europe at the moment. The result will have given everybody at this club and in this stadium a huge lift but only those who watched with their hands over their eyes will be able to ignore the issues that continue to blight this team. It is difficult to say that City played at all well at any stage of the game. They began poorly and were second best for a twenty minute period during which Bayern may have scored twice. Joe Hart blocked one effort and Eliaquim Mangala the other. Frank Lampard was a claming presence in City's engine room as they bounced back to beat Bayern . Lampard looks to the heavens after Xabi Alonso pulls Bayern level... but the Citizens would have the last laugh . Thanks to a super Frank Lampard pass, a rash challenge from Medhi Benatia and a typically well-executed Aguero penalty, City suddenly had the lead and a one-man advantage. On a night when only victory would do, this was their golden ticket. City, however, are so lame these days – so lacking in direction and belief – that even that wasn’t enough to nudge them towards anything remotely approaching superiority. By half-time they were trailing and the most damning thing of all is that nobody here was the slightest bit surprised. Over time, we expected City to impose themselves. Surely Bayern would tire and City would begin to stretch them and squeeze them at the same time. Remarkably, it just didn’t happen. Bayern coach Pep Guardiola summed it up best afterwards when he said: 'We lost the game, we gave them the game. 'Look at the second half. We had ten but Manny [Manuel Neuer] never had to make a save.' Aguero controls the ball as Bayern's Mehdi Benatia prepares to bring him down in the box . Benatia trudges off past Pep Guardiola after the Moroccan received his marching orders . Guardiola was not being deliberately provocative, merely presenting a pretty accurate story of what had happened. Bayern – without a clutch of key players – had kept City at bay with some comfort since edging ahead. There was no cavalry charge from City, merely lots of aimless football, devoid of rhythm and crispness, that was ultimately rendered irrelevant by two stunning Bayern errors that allowed Aguero in twice in quick succession. Quite simply, City must improve. One of their better players was Frank Lampard. Amid all the talk of extending his loan from New York City FC, it is pertinent to ask yourself this: why would he stay and play in a team that currently looks incapable of making a significant impression in the Premier League or in Europe? Does all this sound a bit sour on a night of such drama? Perhaps but City and Pellegrini should heed the warnings and of May 2012. As Mancini found out to his cost, the gloss of these occasions will only last so long.","Aguero gave Pellegrini an incredible chance late on with his winning goal .

"Police revealed today that suspected cop killer Eric Frein may have been planning the attack on state troopers for 'at least a couple of years.' Lt. Col George Bivens of the Pennsylvania State police said investigators have examined a computer Frein used and found he had extensively researched items such as how to avoid police manhunts and other survivalist techniques. Bivens said the computer was not Frein's but one he used. Cops believe the fugitive deliberately destroyed the hard drive on his own computer before going on the run. Scroll down for video . Hideout? Police combed the 400-room resort on 134 acres in Buck Hill Falls, Pennsylvania, which closed in 1991 after 90 years in business. It is now known as a spot where bored teens gather to party and set fires . Rambo: Roman Kamensky took this picture of Eric Frein in April 2009 in Canadensis, Pennsylvania. Frein was looking out of his back window, wearing a Serbian uniform from the 1990s at the time of the break-up of the former Yugoslavia. 'It was what is referred to as an ""impression"" picture,' said Kamensky. 'We take them to create a historical image' In a briefing held Friday afternoon, police revealed that they believe Frein has a radio and could be monitoring news coverage of the massive search. They also say he may have set booby traps for the officers. The hunt for Eric Frein moved to a huge abandoned Poconos resort today. Hundreds of heavily armed cops, many in camouflage, descended on the creepy Inn at Buck Hill Falls in Pennsylvania — once the backdrop for the MTV show Fear. But there were no signs of Frein at the sprawling property despite the search that lasted about 12 hours. The 400-room resort on 134 acres in Buck Hill Falls, Pennsylvania closed in 1991 after 90 years in business and is now known as a spot where bored teens gather to party and set fires. Bivens refused to comment on reports that Frein was initially located after he attempted to make a phone call home. He also would not comment directly on the report that bomb-making equipment was found at his parents' home but said there is a possibility that he has booby trapped areas in the woods where he is hiding. Bivens called Frein 'an assassin' and addressed Frein directly. 'Eric, as I told you last week, you are a coward,' Bivens said. 'Your actions have caused tremendous disruption to an innocent community. 'We will not be intimidated,' Bivens continued. 'We will not leave. We will protect the community, we will find you and we will bring you to justice.' 'We are prepared to stay as long as necessary,' Bivens added. 'We are not going anywhere.' Manhunt: Bivens said Friday's intensive search of the Inn at Buck Hill Falls took between 10 and 12 hours as they searched every inch of the 400-room abandoned hotel and its 4,600 acres, including several caves . Message to Frein: 'Eric, as I told you last week, you are a coward,' Bivens said. 'Your actions have caused tremendous disruption to an innocent community.' Frein was known to visit the Inn at Buck Hill Falls when it was operational, said Pennsylvania State trooper Tom Kelly. Police Special Emergency Response Teams cordoned off the huge property as they went in to make a meticulous search of the massive building and its grounds. Frein, 31, has now been on the run for two weeks after allegedly shooting Pennsylvania state trooper Bryon Dickson to death and critically injuring another trooper, Alex Douglass. As MailOnline exclusively reported on Thursday, Frein may have believed Douglass, 31, was having an affair with the fugitive's sister-in-law Melissa Frein. Melissa Frein lives less than half a mile away from Douglass in Olyphant, Pennsylvania and police admit the two knew each other. They say they aggressively interviewed Melissa about rumors of an affair but say they now do not believe the two were involved. Melissa Frein, who recently left her job at the vaccine company Sanofi Pasteur in Swiftwater, Pennsylvania, did not return calls. A neighbor at the Olyphant address said he hadn't seen the mother-of-two for more than a week although he usually saw her every day. Melissa is the wife of the alleged gunman's older brother, Michael. Eric Frein was best man at their 2007 wedding at St. Joseph Melkite Greek Catholic Church in Scranton, Pennsylvania. Bivens said injured Trooper Douglass remains critical in hospital in a 'serious but stable condition.' He said Douglass had been 'troubled' by reports linking him with Frein's married sister-in-law. Posh: The Buck Hill Falls resort was once a getaway for the rich and famous from New York and Philadelphia, but like many grand resorts in the Poconos it fell into disrepair . Police say the massive search of the hotel was precautionary. Spokesman, Trooper Tom Kelly said there had been no sightings there. 'It's just an area he was familiar with and it needed to be checked and cleared' Where's Frein? Cops searched the resort but with no results. The owners say the inn  would make an ideal boutique hotel with condominiums and other single-family homes . Creepy: The interior of the abandoned hotel is like something out of the film The Shining . The Buck Hill Falls resort was once a getaway for the rich and famous from New York and Philadelphia, but like many grand resorts in the Poconos it fell into disrepair as faraway destinations became more accessible. It is now up for sale with the owners touting 'a 27-hole Donald Ross designed golf course, 10 Har-Tru tennis courts, an expansive stone swimming pool, lawn bowling, blue-ribbon trout streams with waterfalls and hiking trails over approximately 4,500 acres of land,' among its selling points. The owners say it would make an ideal boutique hotel with condominiums and other single-family homes . Police say the massive search of the hotel was precautionary. Spokesman, Trooper Tom Kelly said there had been no sightings there. 'It's just an area he was familiar with and it needed to be checked and cleared.' He did not explain why it has taken two weeks for such a huge potential hiding place to be searched, or why there was such a massive movement of officers and equipment there. The derelict hotel is a four-mile drive from the area south of Canadensis where police have said they were convinced that Frein, a survivalist who is said to harbor a deep resentment of law enforcement officers, had been surrounded. Bivens said that police dogs had flushed Frein out of hiding in the woods on one occasion, but he was so far away from officers that he managed to flee and hide. He said cops have not had a sighting of the fugitive since Tuesday afternoon . They revealed on Wednesday that they had found soiled diapers and a rare brand of Serbian cigarettes in that area bounded by Snow Hill Road and Bear Town Road. They say books taken from Frein's home advised survivalists to wear diapers so they could stay in one place for extended periods. Frein has been known to visit the hotel when it was operational, said Pennsylvaia State trooper Tom Kelly. Motive? The story that state trooper Alex Douglass (right), who survived the shooting, and Melissa Frein,  the wife of Eric Frein's brother Michael (left) were having an affair has spread like wildfire through the towns surrounding Canadensis . Since the September 12 shootings, hundreds of police from all over Pennsylvania have been joined by officers from neighboring New York and New Jersey as well as members of the FBI, the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives and federal marshals as they search for Frein in woods south of the picturesque town of Canadensis. Local residents have been turned out of their houses, searched and in some cases had to spend nights in their cars as police carry out their search. The change in the focus of the search came amid new reports that Frein may have laid pipe bombs in the woods to prevent cops reaching him. The Philadelphia Inquirer quoted sources as saying bomb-making equipment was found in his parents' home which is in the center of the search area. 'When investigators searched his parents' home this month, they found bomb-making materials but no finished explosives,' the Inquirer reported. The paper also said Frein had tried to call his parents on September 18, the sixth day of the search and that the 'ping' from the call was traced, allowing police to close on him. 'Why Frein turned on his phone was unclear,' the Inquirer reported. 'And despite spotting him more than once since then, police and agents are proceeding with extreme caution because they believe Frein may have stashed pipe bombs in the terrain where he now is hiding.' Bivens refused to comment on reports that Frein was initially located after he attempted to make a phone call home. He also would not comment directly on the report that bomb-making equipment was found at his parents' home but said there is a possibility that he has booby trapped areas in the woods where he is hiding. Bivens appeared more downbeat than he had at previous press briefings. When questioned on his demeanor, he said: 'I dn't want anyone to thin I am not very confident that we are going to capture him. I am absolutely certain that we are going to capture him.' Bivens said Frein bought several items before the shootings that would enable him to build a bunker-style hide-out in the woods. However he said police have not found that bunker though they have found many caves and outcrops that would give shelter. Bivens said the soiled diapers and Serbian cigarettes that police had earlier found are still at the lab and positive DNA results should come within a matter of days. The search area expanded on Thursday to include much of the village of Canadensis and the surrounding communities of Cresco and Mountainhome. Police say they have been constantly changing the perimeter of their search area as possible new sightings are made. Police say they do not believe Frein will target members of the public but they think he plans to kill more officers.","A computer used by Eric Frein revealed he did an extensive computer search on how to avoid police manhunts .

"Found dead: Josie Leigh Herniman, 15, of Somerset, killed herself in woodland after being mercilessly taunted by school bullies, it has been claimed . A 15-year-old girl killed herself in woodland after being mercilessly taunted by school bullies, it was claimed today. Josie Leigh Herniman, of Weston-super-Mare, Somerset, was discovered after police received reports of the body of a teenage girl in woods around a mile from her home. Some friends blamed bullies for her death, while relatives said police had seized her mobile phone and computer as part of their probe. In an emotional statement, her parents, Paul and Zoe Herniman, said: ‘We are totally devastated by the unexpected loss of our bright and beautiful daughter and wonderful sister to Ellie, Daisy, Mya and Jordan. 'Our bright light has gone out and we will never see her grow and achieve all the goals she had dreamt about. We would like to thank everyone who has supported us through this sad time and our hearts go out to everyone who has been affected by this.’ Writing on a Facebook page created in her memory which already has more than 5,000 likes, her uncle Joe Sheppard said: ‘Thanks for all the lovely messages and support. ‘Nice to see she was loved and cared about by so many. If only she could see that. As a family we are devastated and has completely ripped us apart. We still don’t want to believe it. ‘The police have got her phone and laptop and will be going through it, so whoever was bullying expect a knock on the door. We will get justice.' But Avon and Somerset Police rejected the suggestion that she had been the victim of bullying, saying that neither detectives, teachers nor Josie's parents were aware of ‘any issue'. Scroll down for video . 'Loved and cared about': A Facebook page created in Josie's memory already has more than 5,000 likes . Tribute: Josie was described by her parents as a ‘bright and beautiful daughter and wonderful sister’ Josie - a pupil at Broadoak Mathematics and Computing College, a school of 900 pupils rated ‘good’ by Ofsted - was found in woods close to Weston Hospital at around 9pm on Monday. A candlelit vigil was held by friends last night on the beach near her home, with lanterns released. Her friend Jerry Jackson said on Facebook: ‘If it weren’t for those bullies you would still be alive. ‘You helped me through some tough times when I got bullied. You were the nicest, friendliest girl I had ever met. It’s so sad that we all lost you at such a young age.’ Jayne Berryman wrote: ‘Such a lovely looking girl and such a young age. This has brought tears to my eyes that bullies can do this to someone.’ And Angelina Hughes said: ‘Bullies make my blood boil. Both my girls have been through bullying. They should be named and shamed and held accountable for their actions.’ Floral memorial: The woods near Weston General Hospital in Somerset today, where Josie's body was found . Meanwhile James Carter wrote: ‘It’s an absolute tragedy that a young lady like this is forced into doing something as desperate as this. ‘I can’t believe that in today’s allegedly caring and educated society this is allowed to happen. Why is bullying in schools still regarded as something that has to be dealt with by the school? Surely a situation that results in this needs to be dealt with by the police. Police investigating her death: Fifteen-year-old Josie was found in woods at around 9pm on Monday . 'Threatening these cowards and brainless individuals with suspension from school or expelling them is no deterrent.’ Her death has now been referred to the coroner and an inquest is expected to be opened in the coming days. Educational psychologists are now supporting students at her college. Broadoak headmistress Shelagh Pritchard said: ‘Our thoughts are with Josie’s family at what must be an incredibly difficult time for them. 'We have spoken to the Year 11 students this morning to tell them the news which has come as a complete shock to all of us. ‘We are getting help and expertise from education psychologists from North Somerset Council as we do all we can to support the whole school community over the coming days. The 56-year-old added: ‘Josie was a popular and lively student who had been planning for a college career. She will be sadly missed by staff and students, but not forgotten.’ Avon and Somerset Police Detective Sergeant Martin Longden, who is investigating on behalf of the Avon coroner, said: ‘This is a tragic event and our thoughts are with Josie's family who are devastated by her death. 'The loss of this young life has understandably had a significant impact on the community. 'While I understand people are shocked, upset and looking for answers, I must ask people to respect the family in their grief and not speculate or draw their own conclusions. ‘This is also important to protect the young people, Josie's friends, who have been so terribly affected by this tragedy. ‘We are carrying out a very thorough inquiry on behalf of the coroner, and the evidence will be laid before the coroner's court. ‘Specialist officers are conducting inquiries and we are liaising and working with partner agencies. It will be for the inquest to decide how this tragedy came about, based on the evidence. Education: Josie was a pupil at Broadoak Mathematics and Computing College (pictured) in Weston-super-Mare, Somerset - a school of 900 pupils rated ‘good’ by Ofsted in its last inspection in November 2012 . ‘I'm aware of the speculation on social media and at this stage in our inquiries I can say that neither the police nor the school nor Josie's parents are aware of any issue with bullying.’ According to its last Ofsted report in November 2012, students told inspectors that incidents of bullying based on name-calling, racism or homophobia were rare. They added that any incidents that did arise were dealt with appropriately by staff. The report also said students showed a clear understanding of the ‘pernicious effects of cyber-bullying’. Mrs Pritchard added later today that staff, students and Josie's family had been ‘deeply upset’ by suggestions that bullying had been behind the schoolgirl’s death. She said: ‘As a school community we would like to remember Josie as she was - a lively and popular student, a gifted artist, and a great friend to many. ‘Books of condolences will be opened at the college to be passed on to the family, and a memorial service will be planned. I am very proud of the supportive and thoughtful way Broadoak students have responded to such a shocking event. ‘We respectfully ask that the college community be allowed to grieve and come to terms with their loss. Our thoughts remain very much with the family at this difficult time.’","Josie Leigh Herniman, of Weston-super-Mare, was discovered by police .

"Borussia Dortmund manager Jurgen Klopp insists he will show no mercy to under-fire Arsene Wenger on Wednesday, despite his side's early qualification for the Champions League knock-out stages. The Germans have already booked their place in the last 16 and can cement their place at the top of Group D with a point on Wednesday. And Klopp, whose side are a lowly 16th in the Bundesliga, wants to compound the misery on Arsenal; insisting his side will not go easy on the London club.

He said: 'I don't know so much about the situation of Arsenal and British football. I don't know what the people think here. 'My plan is not for us to take our foot off the gas.

"Aston Villa's record signing Darren Bent is set to join Championship club Brighton on a short-term loan deal. The former England international, signed for £18million in 2011, has made little impact under Paul Lambert at Villa Park, and Seagulls boss Sami Hyypia has swooped for the ex-Tottenham man. Talks over a deal until January are at an advanced stage and could be concluded in the next 24 hours. Aston Villa striker Darren Bent (right) is set for a loan move to Championship side Brighton . The 30-year-old forward joined the Midlands club for £18m but has struggled to get into the team recently . Bent joined Fulham on a season-long deal last season but scored just three goals in 24 games. Another former England striker who could be on the move is Emile Heskey. The 36-year-old has revealed he would return to Leicester if he got a call from Nigel Pearson. Heskey, who began his career with Leicester, is without a club after two years in Australia with Newcastle Jets. ‘I’d love to come,’ he told BBC Radio. ‘It is a great club.’ Pearson’s side are in the bottom three but Heskey thinks they can stay up. ‘They have a decent squad, they just need that little pick me up,’ he added.

"Luis Suarez has expressed his delight after scoring his first goal for Barcelona. The former Liverpool striker had to wait until his sixth game to score following his £75million summer move, and the Uruguayan was clearly relieved to have broken his duck. He said: 'Obviously it's important for a striker to be scoring goals even though the priority is that you are playing well for the team. But it feels good to get off the mark. Former Liverpool man Luis Suarez scored his first goal for the club in his sixth appearance . 'We knew they would play with ten men behind the ball because that is the way they played at the Camp Nou but we played well in the first half, we took our chances and could have maybe gone in with an even bigger lead. We also chased everything when we didn't have the ball which is also very important.' Suarez opened the scoring in Barcelona's Champions League clash with APOEL Nicosia, while a Lionel Messi hat-trick ensured he became the highest scorer in European Cup history.

"Arsenal fear Jack Wilshere will need ankle surgery, which could rule him out for up to four months. The England midfielder limped off during Arsenal’s 2-1 defeat by Manchester United on Saturday after a challenge by Paddy McNair. Wilshere, 22, left the Emirates without crutches, raising hopes that the injury might not be serious, but he in fact suffered ligament damage to his left ankle. He will have a further assessment on Thursday when he is due to see an ankle specialist. Surgery would probably sideline him until March, but even without an operation he will miss up to three months. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Arsene Wenger: Wilshere and Welbeck out of Dortmund clash . Jack Wilshere could be out for up to four months after damaging his left ankle on Saturday . Wilshere (left) suffered ankle ligament damage following Manchester United's Paddy McNair's tackle . Perhaps the only positive from Wilshere’s latest injury is that it did not occur on his already troublesome right ankle. ‘It does not look good,’ admitted Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger. ‘There is no bone damage but there is ligament damage. It is just how [long] it is, which we should know next week. ‘It is so sad because he just came back and had found his mobility. I hope it will not be surgery, just in a boot, but it will be a few weeks.’ Wenger, speaking as he planned for Wednesday's Champions League clash at home to Borussia Dortmund, was unhappy with McNair’s challenge but refused to criticise the United youngster. The challenge left Wilshere on the pitch in agony as he now faces the possibility of undergoing surgery . The 22-year-old's (bottom) injury adds to a miserable run of luck for the Gunners . The Arsenal manager said: ‘The tackle caught him from the side, just when he had moved the ball a bit forwards too much. Then, when he dived to make the pass, McNair came in to make the tackle and took him from the back and the side. ‘When you see the picture, it is very bad. I don’t think it was a tackle with the desire to hurt. I think he went for the ball, but it was a late tackle; a tackle which a young player can do. It was a bad foul.’ Wilshere’s stricken state heaps misery on a terrible few weeks for Arsenal. They fell to two successive Premier League defeats and let slip a 3-0 lead against Anderlecht in their previous Champions League game to draw. The discontent caused by their worst start to a Premier League season was underlined this week by the club’s second largest shareholder, Alisher Usmanov. Usmanov aimed stinging criticism at Wenger’s team, and also claimed the manager is not learning from his mistakes. Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger has been criticised by the club’s second largest shareholder, Alisher Usmanov . Wenger, who was chirpy at Tuesday’s press conference despite his side’s troubles, responded robustly to Usmanov’s comments, saying: ‘We have values at this club. The first one is when we go through a difficult patch, we show solidarity. ‘That is a very important one. The second one is that when you have something to say to each other, we say it face to face. We don’t need to go to the newspapers. When you’re from this club, you’re from this club. You’re in or out, you cannot be both. ‘What is important is how close we are together inside the club and how much we can respond to people who question our quality.’ Wenger insisted: ‘I believe that this group of players will have a very strong season. I’m ready to bet with you on that. I’m long enough in the game to know if there’s something there or not. Wenger was accused of 'not learning from his mistakes' after the club's successive Premier League defeats . ‘There’s a lot there. It is one of the best teams I’ve had for a long time. We are the team who has the least shots against us in the Premier League. ‘We are the team who creates most chances. There’s a lot of positives but, at the end of the day, you either win or lose. It depends on very little things sometimes. ‘When you are so long in football, you don’t really understand what crisis means. I best get to the dictionary. ‘I believe in what I do and I believe especially in my players. I question myself every day and I hope you do that as well.’ Arsenal midfielder Aaron Ramsey (right) has hailed the club's team-spirit despite their poor form . Midfielder Aaron Ramsey backed his manager, saying: ‘We believe in ourselves, we have a great team spirit and we are not too concerned with what is being said about us. We know all about what we are capable of doing. It is just some fine-tuning.’ Arsenal’s defence has been heavily criticised in recent weeks, while Wenger admitted on Saturday that his side’s back four have shown naivety in recent encounters. Laurent Koscielny could make his first appearance in two months after recovering from an Achilles injury. However, Theo Walcott is still suffering from the groin problem that kept him out of Saturday evening’s defeat by United. Danny Welbeck is a doubt for Wednesday after missing training on Tuesday with a knee problem. Yaya Sanogo is on stand-by to replace him. Olivier Giroud is ineligible after being left out of Arsenal’s Champions League squad. He was originally expected to miss all the group matches because of a broken leg.

"Chelsea secured qualification for the knockout stages of the Champions League with an emphatic 5-0 win away at Schalke. John Terry, Willian and a Jan Kirchhoff own goal put the Blues' 3-0 ahead at half-time before second-half substitutes Didier Drogba and Ramires completed the scoreline.

He doesn't give anyone a second on the ball. Nemanja Matic - 7 . The perfect foil to the skill and prowess of Fabregas. Broke up play brilliantly and gave Chelsea a platform to attack freely.

Recieved a deserved pat on the back from Mourinho following his substitution. Eden Hazard - 7.5 . One of the Belgian's more subdued games, but his will to drive towards the byline and and beat a man keeps defenders busy. Diego Costa - 7 . Will have been frustrated not to score on a night in which Chelsea were so dominant. Having said that, Costa was a constant threat and if he wasn't making space for himself, he was doing so for his team-mates. Blues striker Diego Costa (right) failed to score on Tuesday but was a willing runner for his side . Subs . Didier Drogba (66' on for Costa) - 7.5 .

"Click here for updates on Phil Hughes' condition after his injury . Reaction from across the cricket world to the incident . The cricket world is in shock after the news that Phil Hughes is in a critical condition after being hit on the head by a bouncer playing for South Australia against New South Wales in the Sheffield Shield. Not only shock because of the extent of the Australian’s injuries but because this is an incident of unprecedented seriousness, certainly since helmets were introduced more than 30 years ago to significantly reduce the risk of being hurt while batting in cricket. While what happened in the historic surroundings of the Sydney Cricket Ground can legitimately be called a freak incident perhaps the biggest surprise is that this sort of thing is, thankfully, so rare in the great game. WARNING Some pictures and video in this story may be distressing . Phil Hughes reacts after being hit on the head by a delivery from pace bowler Sean Abbott . Hughes turns away from Abbott's bouncer and the ball hits him on the side of the head . A cricket ball is a seriously hard, dangerous weapon when propelled at close to a 100 miles per hour by the best bowlers in the world and perhaps the most sobering thought after a truly horrible affair is that injury on this scale doesn’t happen more regularly. Batsmen have been hit on the head and been badly hurt over the years - of course they have, and incidents involving Australian Rick McCosker, New Zealand’s Ewan Chatfield, Mike Gatting, Ricky Ponting and England’s Stuart Broad only last summer come to mind - but no-one that I can recall has been as badly hurt as the stricken Hughes. There is no point blaming the safety equipment because cricket, as with so much sport, comes with an inherent risk and the great strides that have been made ever since Mike Brearley first appeared in the Seventies with a sort of skull cap and Dennis Amiss wore a motorcycle helmet have been huge. Stuart Broad is hit by a ball that got through his grille against India last summer . The England man tries to stop the bleeding from his nose (left) and lines up for a team photo some days later . Cricketers have always sought protection and there were tales of batsmen using towels, scarves and padded caps before Patsy Hendren was one of the first to use a self designed protective hat in the 1930s. World Series Cricket saw the first helmets being worn regularly, most notably by Warwickshire and England batsman Amiss, while Australia’s Graham Yallop was the first to wear a helmet in a Test, against West Indies in 1978. The design and level of safety has evolved ever since but even last summer more moves were made to protect batsmen after Broad had been struck in the gap between his safety grille and the peak of his airtek helmet, commonly regarded now as the safest design, at Old Trafford against India and was lucky to escape serious injury.

Mike Gatting holds his face and throws away his bat after being hit by a Malcolm Marshall bouncer in 1986 . Gatting returns to the pavilion at Sabina Park, Jamaica, with blood pouring from his nose . But they cannot be foolproof and those batsmen who reach the very top will tell you that fear never enters their head. The last thing Hughes would have been thinking of was getting hurt as he attempted to pull a short ball from New South Wales' seamer Sean Abbott on Tuesday morning. Lesser players would have simply got out of the way. He and all other international batsmen would not be successful if they did worry about injury and fear is more likely to be found at a much lower level, where club players can be seen putting self-preservation ahead of the need to score runs, certainly lower order batsmen. There is a theory that helmets have actually increased the risk of injury in a weird sort of way, because they encourage the very best batsmen to go for more audacious shots than they would ever have attempted bare headed.

Former England batsman Dennis Amiss in the nets in 1978 wearing his helmet . The art of ducking and weaving, for instance, as batsmen would have had to master against the great fast bowlers of a bygone age like Dennis Lillee and Jeff Thomson, has almost disappeared in an era when batsmen, highly protected and with huge heavy bats, are dominant and bowlers are rarely as quick as they once were. None of which is particularly relevant to the plight of the talented and highly popular Hughes, a well regarded figure in the English county game as well as of an opponent of England’s, as he fights for his life in a Sydney hospital. His has been an up-and-down career at the highest level and he has not played a Test for Australia since struggling against England in the 2013 Ashes and scoring just one and one in the last of his 26 Tests to date at Lord’s. But he was on the way back as far as Australia were concerned and was expected to play in the first Test against India because of injury to his friend and captain Michael Clarke, who was at his bedside on Tuesday after the horrific incident. There is huge sympathy too for young fast bowler Abbott, 22, who was being comforted and offered psychological support after his unwitting part in this tragic affair. He will know that no-one blames him for beating Hughes' defences but that will not make him feel any the less distraught. For now, the cricket community has come together in their support of one of their own. The world’s thoughts are with Phil Hughes and his family.

"Tiny microbes hidden in the soil are one of the major amplifiers of global warming. But researchers are unsure whether these microbes are slaves to their environment or the cause of climate change. Now, scientists from the U.S., Sweden and Australia, claim to have evidence that a single species of microbe found in Sweden may be driving global warming. Scientists from the U.S., Sweden and Australia, claim to have shown that a single species of microbe found in Sweden may be driving global warming. The researchers installed special instruments for measuring methane changes using Plexiglas chambers that trap the gases emanating from the soil . The discovery could help scientists improve their simulations of climate change by including data on how microbes control the release of gases, such as methane. Earlier this year, scientists found a single species of microbe in permafrost soils of northern Sweden that had begun to thaw under the effect of globally rising temperatures. Researchers suspected that the microbe played a role in global warming by releasing vast amounts of carbon stored in permafrost soil close to the Arctic Circle in the form of methane. Methane is a powerful greenhouse gas responsible for trapping heat in the Earth's atmosphere. But the actual role of this microbe - dubbed Methanoflorens stordalenmirensis, which roughly translates to 'methane-bloomer from the Stordalen Mire' - was unknown. The discovery in Sweden could help scientists improve their simulations of climate change by including data on how microbes control the release of gases, such as methane . The international research team installed automated chambers that measure greenhouse gases emanating from the soil as microbes metabolise nutrients previously locked up in the permafrost soil . The new research pins down the role of the new microbe, finding that the amount of Methanoflorens, should help to predict their collective impact on future climate change. 'If you think of the African savanna as an analogy, you could say that both lions and elephants produce carbon dioxide, but they eat different things,' said senior author Scott Saleska, an associate professor at the University of Arizona. 'In Methanoflorens, we discovered the microbial equivalent of an elephant, an organism that plays an enormously important role in what happens to the whole ecosystem.' Climate-changing microbes, known as Methanosarcina (pictured), may have caused the biggest mass extinction in history . The worst mass extinction in Earth's history - long before dinosaurs roamed the planet - was caused by microbes, according to a recent study. The tiny organisms suddenly began belching out the greenhouse gas methane - which is about 20 per cent more potent than carbon dioxide - some 250 million years ago. Fumes spurted from the oceans wiping out 90 per cent of all species, from snails and small crustaceans to early forms of lizards and amphibians in less than 20,000 years. The 'Great Dying' occurred more than 252 million years ago - long before dinosaurs lived roamed Earth - at the end of Permian era. In the past asteroids, volcanoes and raging coal fires have been blamed but the finger is now being pointed at tiny microbes called Methanosarcina. These spewed enormous amounts of methane into the atmosphere, dramatically altering the climate and the chemistry of the oceans. Unable to adapt in time, countless species perished and vanished from the Earth. Alarmingly, the same effects are starting to happen today as a result of global warming caused by carbon emissions. The study revealed that because of these microbial activities, all wetlands are not the same when it comes to methane release. 'This has been a major shortcoming of current climate models,' said lead author Carmody McCalley, at the University of New Hampshire. 'They assume the wrong isotope ratio coming out of the wetlands, the models overestimate carbon released by biological processes and underestimate carbon released by human activities such as fossil-fuel burning.' To study microbes, researchers drive cores into the ground at Abisko National Park in northern Sweden . One of the big questions facing climate scientists, according to Professor Saleska, is how much of the carbon stored in soils is released into the atmosphere by microbial activity. 'As the ""global freezer"" of permafrost is failing under the influence of warming, we need to better understand how soil microbes release carbon on a larger, ecosystem-wide level and what is going to happen with it,' he said. 'For years, there's been a debate about whether microbial ecology 'matters' to what an ecosystem collectively does,' added Virginia Rich from the University of Arizona. 'This work shows that microbial ecology matters to a great degree, and that we need to pay more attention to the types of microbes living in those thawing ecosystems.' Projected temperature change from 2081-2100. One of the big questions facing climate scientists, according to Professor Saleska, is how much of the carbon stored in soils is released into the atmosphere by microbes .","Scientists found the microbe in permafrost soil of northern Sweden .

"It seems to be a question of when rather than if Chelsea win the Premier League this season, and Bloomberg Sports predict they will wrap up the title on May 2. The world leaders in sports analytic technology calculate the percentage probabilities for league finishes using their match analysis, with Jose Mourinho's side final points total projected at 90. Their previous annual predictions had Manchester City winning the league but the reigning champions are now expected to finish eight points behind Chelsea, with Manchester United and Arsenal completing the top four. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Mourinho: If Chelsea lose title it won't be down to complacency . Chelsea are flying in the Premier League so far this season and are expected to wrap up the title on May 2 . Manchester City won the title last season but are projected to finish eight points behind the eventual winners . Louis van Gaal's Manchester United are tipped to complete the top three by Bloomberg Sports . Bloomberg power ratings and multiple data points from numerous seasons of every team are analysed . Once this Bloomberg Sports rating is calculated using the data above, each match of the 2013-14 season was simulated 100,000 times providing an accurate sample . League projections are based on probability of finishing top, in Champions League positions, top or bottom half, or chance of relegation . Goals for and goals against also taken into consideration . Accuracy is tested against bookmaker odds, with strong results . League table is updated throughout the season . The data analysts say there is a 21.1 per cent chance of the Blues clinching the title in their first fixture in May against Crystal Palace, with three games remaining. Somewhat surprisingly, Chelsea's closest rivals at present, Southampton, are tipped to come eighth, 13 points outside the Champions League places, with a 2.2 per cent chance of finishing fourth or above. That is because Ronald Koeman's in-form Saints have yet to face any several so called 'bigger' sides, such as Bloomberg Sports' projected top four. Things aren't looking good for Arsene Wenger and Arsenal at present, but they are expected to qualify for the Champions League for an 18th time in a row, in what could be a tense final day of the season. The data has just seven points separating the Gunners, Liverpool, Tottenham and Everton, while West Ham are tipped to finish in 11th despite their fine start to the season. It could be an unsuccessful season for the Premier League newcomers, with Burnley, QPR and Leicester pictured in the graphic finishing in the relegation zone. They all currently occupy the bottom three places. However, Hull City, Crystal Palace and Aston Villa could also threaten those spots with a relegation percentage above 20. Southampton are Chelsea's nearest challengers this season but have a 2.2 per cent chance of a top four finish . Arsene Wenger (left, Arsenal) and Brendan Rodgers (r, Liverpool) could battle for a Champions League place .

CAF is sure to strip Morocco of the hosting rights and might begin disciplinary proceedings which could severely affect their participation in future African competitions. But CAF must also find a solution to the hosting of its showpiece event or face a heavy financial blow if the tournament has to be called off. Effectively, by ruling out moving the 16-team finals from its scheduled dates, CAF would have to find a new host. On Monday, Ghana joined the list of countries turning down the opportunity to stage the event. “The representation we have received from people in the health sector (means) it doesn’t look (like) Ghana is in a position to accepting hosting the tournament and we have conveyed this message to CAF,” said sports minister Mahama Ayariga . Egypt and South Africa have also issued a public ‘no’. CAF president Issa Hayatou is adamant that the tournament should go ahead this winter as planned . But CAF executive committee member Constant Omari suggested on Monday there was a plan to ensure the tournament would go ahead. “The financial damage and the consequences for CAF and its marketing partners would be too severe to call it off,” he told French radio. CAF media director Junior Binyam said a statement that CAF’s decision would be communicated only after the conclusion of the executive committee meeting, which could stretch into Wednesday.

"A Connecticut high school principal and assistant principal have been charged with failing to report a sexual relationship between a teacher and a student. Stamford High School professor Danielle Watkins, 32, is facing two charges of second-degree sexual assault for an affair with her 18-year-old pupil between September 2013 and June this year. But police claim the liaison could have been stopped earlier as principal Donna Valentine and assistant head Roth Nordin were made aware of the situation as early as December 2013 and did not report it. Charged: Stamford High School principal Danielle Valentine, 62, and assistant headteacher Roth Nordin, 59, are facing fines of up to $2,500 for failing to report an affair between an English teacher and her 18-year-old pupil . Now, Valentine and Nordin both face a fine of up to $2,500 each as state law requires school officials to report any suspected relationship between and adult and a student. The student told police he was afraid to report the affair because Watkins, a married mother-of-two, threatened to fail him. Eventually, when he finished the school year in June, the student told a guidance counselor who told the school and the Department of Children and Families. However, according to police, the school had already conducted an independent investigation into the affair before he went to the counselor, but they had not notified the Department of Children and Families. Valentine's attorney, Mark Sherman, says the charges are only accusations and don't reflect the principal's long commitment to the safety of her students. Affair: Danielle Watkins, 32, handed herself in to police after the student reported their eight-month liaison . Family: Watkins, an English teacher who allegedly threatened to fail the boy when he tried to break off their relationship, is pictured with her husband and one of their children . Watkins, who taught English at the school, turned herself in to police in July. She has also been charged with drug possession as she allegedly bought marijuana for the student and his 15-year-old friend - whom she also taught - and let him drive her car while knowing he did not have a license. Her two students smoked the drug during school hours, sometimes on school grounds, the older boy told police. On June 26, three days after telling the counselor about the affair, he went to Stamford Police to make a statement about the relationship. The 15-year-old boy also gave a statement to police. On June 27, police officers pulled over Watkins' car and inside they found marijuana and a cell phone, which contained evidence she had sent naked photos of herself to the boy. Secret: She also allegedly provided the Stamford High School (pictured) pupil with marijuana . Lt. Diedrich Hohn, in charge of the case, told MailOnline that she was 'hostile' and 'verbally combative' during the search. As cops pulled her over, she had tried to hide her cellphone under the passenger seat, he said. Watkins allegedly exchanged more than 2,000 text messages and hundreds of phone calls with the teenager. She was released on $100,000 bond and she is scheduled to appear in court July 31 after being charged her with sexual assault and sale of marijuana in regard to the first victim and sale of marijuana and risk of injury to a minor in connection with the younger boy.","Connecticut teacher Danielle Watkins 'had an eight-month affair with one of her students and sent him nude pictures of herself'

"Just before the lights threatened to go out on Liverpool’s season, the players’ phones lit up with news on social media that Mario Balotelli had made his way to the Echo Arena. The Liverpool forward, casually dressed in three-quarter length jeans and camouflage loafers, had taken a front-row seat to watch Tony Bellew and Nathan Cleverly slug it out over 12 rounds. At that point, a few Liverpool players at their team hotel in London wanted to get the Italian in the ring. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Sportsmail preview: Ludogorets Razgrad vs Liverpool . Mario Balotelli (right) sat and watched the boxing from a ringside seat at the Echo Arena on Saturday night . Balotelli took his seat at the Liverpool Echo Arena, raising questions over whether he'd face Crystal Palace . Ostensibly, Balotelli had permission to do whatever he wanted because a hamstring injury ruled him out of the 450-mile round trip for Sunday’s 3-1 defeat at Crystal Palace. But, after four defeats in a row for Brendan Rodgers and his team, the done thing is to keep your head down. The publicity did not go down well at breakfast the following morning, but nobody within the Liverpool camp was particularly surprised by Balotelli’s appearance. It was a new low. Since Balotelli’s arrival at Anfield his attitude, particularly towards some of the younger players at the squad, has created tension within the dressing room. The Liverpool players haven't been impressed with Balotelli's attitude since his summer move . The 24-year-old striker has scored just two goals for Liverpool since his £16million move from AC Milan . During a series of television interviews given by the Italian before the Palace game, he claimed he was working harder than at any other time in his career. It was a remarkable declaration for a player who has not scored a goal in the Premier League since netting at Wigan on November 28, 2012, when he was still a Manchester City player. On the pitch, his movement — with the exception of his debut against Tottenham and his goal in the Champions League against Ludogorets — has been non-existent. He is vacuous. The spirit at Liverpool, built up last season during their dramatic chase for the Premier League title, has been eroded by the forward’s presence on the training ground. Balotelli hasn't scored a Premier League goal since his strike for Manchester City against Wigan in 2012 . Brendan Rodgers looks on as Liverpool are beaten 3-1 by Crystal Palace at Selhurst Park on Sunday . There are further issues within the Liverpool dressing room too, something Rodgers alluded to in his analysis of his team’s wretched defeat at Palace. Liverpool’s manager admitted they are ‘low on confidence’, but went on to say that they ‘had been a close group . . . but had to make changes’. Those refinements have not suited a team that finished within a whisker of beating Manchester City to the title last season. On Sunday, as Steven Gerrard waited to lead his team out at Selhurst Park, he stood with his chin resting in the palm of his hand. He looked as if he had the weight of the world on his shoulders. Liverpool’s captain has been troubled since he was left out of the team to face Real Madrid at the Bernabeu on November 4. Raheem Sterling has been in good form, but looks in desperate need of a rest . Steven Gerrard dropped to the bench for Liverpool's Champions League match against Real Madrid . Steven Gerrard will be feeling the pain of Liverpool's poor run of form more than anyone . 4 - Liverpool are just four points above the drop zone . 20th - Liverpool are far closer to the bottom of the league (six points off) than they are the top (18 points off) 1.3 - Goals per game let in by Rodgers’ side, the worst rate of any Liverpool boss in nearly 50 years. 10 - Rodgers’ side have 10 fewer points than they did at this stage last season . 6 - Liverpool have lost six and won four league games this season. In the equivalent set of fixtures last season they won six and lost three . 38% - Liverpool have kept clean sheets in 38 per cent of Rodgers’ games . Four core players — Gerrard, Raheem Sterling, Philippe Coutinho and Jordan Henderson — had slogged their guts out last season for the right to start in games like that. They had travelled to Spain, returned to Liverpool midway through the night and then faced Chelsea in the lunchtime kick-off at Anfield the following Saturday. They lost 2-1. Now that the team are five points off a place in the Champions League and are battling to stay in the competition this week, there are no guarantees any of them will return to the Bernabeu any time soon. They have lost four successive games and Gerrard, who usually fronts up whatever the manner of a defeat, could not get on the team bus quick enough after Sunday’s loss. Sterling, meanwhile, is in desperate need of a rest. In addition, his contract remains unsigned. The Liverpool captain was quick to get on the team bus following his side's latest defeat . Rodgers' side have won just four of the first 12 Premier League games so far this season . Sterling appeared downbeat on Monday as Liverpool's woeful start to the season continued . Alberto Moreno looked lost when he wandered out of the wrong exit at Selhurst Park and little wonder after an orthodox right-back — Glen Johnson — was preferred to him at left-back. Rickie Lambert, who scored his first Premier League goal since joining his boyhood club, told Sky Sports that the attitude of the players had not been good enough. The defeat at Palace has caused Fenway Sports Group to take an even greater interest in the running of the team after Rodgers admitted he is fighting to save his job. The club’s owners are known to keep tabs on every newspaper, television programme and blog as they gauge supporter opinion in an environment they openly admit to knowing very little about.

After unsuccessfully picking the lock they use the screwdriver to smash the patio doors before running in and out in two minutes. A piggybank, briefcase containing jewellery, documents and spare keys to the family’s two Audis were all taken in the raid.

"A celebrity-backed campaign to keep bluefin tuna off dinner plates and in the sea is reaping environmental rewards. Scientists claim that the endangered fish population is showing signs of recovery, but warn there is still much to do to preserve the species for future generations. Populations of the tuna remain at historically low levels, but the numbers of Atlantic bluefin are rising for the first time in decades. Scroll down for video . Scientists claim that the endangered bluefin tuna fish population is showing signs of recovery, but warn there is still much to do to preserve the species for future generations. A shoal of the fish is shown in the Mediterranean sea, off the coast of Turkey . The gourmet fish fell victim to over fishing and, in a bid to save it, celebrities including Sienna Miller, Elle Macpherson and Stephen Fry, called for an end to the practice, with Emilia Fox and Terry Gilliam going so far as to pose naked with fish to grab attention for the sustainable fishing campaign, Fish love. They were reportedly inspired to act after watching a film called The End of the Line, which was the first to expose over fishing and featured bluefin tuna being caught in the Mediterranean. Earlier this week, the scientific committee for the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT) met in Madrid, Spain to assess the situation of the bluefin tuna in the East Atlantic and the Mediterranean. In 2009, the commission reported that stocks had declined  by 72 per cent in the Eastern Atlantic, and 82 per cent in the west over 40 years. Now, the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) has said the fish is ‘no longer at risk of collapse’. The gourmet fish fell victim to over fishing and celebrities, including Sienna Miller, Elle Macpherson (pictured left) and Stephen Fry (pictured right) called for an end to the practice . Emilia Fox, Monty Python Terry Gilliam and Greta Scacchi went so far as to pose naked with fish to grab attention for the campaign and promote sustainable fishing . ICCAT experts found that management efforts developed in recent years have resulted in an increase in population size, even including the possibility that the stock might soon recover to sustainable levels - the so-called Maximum Sustainable Yield level - MSY. Bluefin tuna - Thunnus spp - can weigh up to 1,500lbs and grow to between 6ft (1.8 metres) and 10ft (3 metres) long. They live in the east and west of the Atlantic Ocean, but are now extinct in the Black Sea. Throughout history, the fish has been a prized food and large fish are targeted for the Japanese raw fish market, which are used to make gourmet sushi. The commercial importance of the species has led to overfishing. ICAAT said in 2009 that stocks had declined over 40 years by 72 per cent in the Eastern Atlantic, and 82 per cent in the west. In 2010, measures were taken to restrict the number of fish being caught. Dr Sergi Tudela, Head of Fisheries at WWF Mediterranean, said: ‘In spite of the high uncertainties surrounding the assessment, one thing appears clear today: the stock is no longer at risk of collapse, and this is a direct result of the current recovery plan. ‘However, strong concerns remain, particularly regarding the traceability of the fish.’ ‘We might be very close to what would be a resounding success in the history of fisheries, the dream of a sustainable bluefin tuna fishery in the Eastern Mediterranean and the Atlantic - let’s hope the lessons of the past have been fully learned and that - at least this time - history doesn’t repeat itself.’ There are two main stocks of Bluefin tuna. The larger of the two is in the Eastern Atlantic, including the Mediterranean Sea and the smaller lies in the western part of the ocean such as the Gulf of Mexico, The Independent reported. The most dramatic signs of a recovery have been seen in the eastern waters of the Atlantic. A WWF spokesman said: 'The stock [of bluefin tuna] is no longer at risk of collapse, and this is a direct result of the current recovery plan.' Here, one of the mighty fish is tagged so scientists can learn more about it .","Bluefin population is showing signs of recovery for the first time in decades .

"Brutal, utterly brutal. If Jose Mourinho’s dismissive pre-match comments about Roberto di Matteo’s glorious achievements seemed a little unkind then this was worse, much worse. And how Mourinho will have savoured it because here was a performance to encapsulate the point he had been trying to make. Winning the Champions League is all very well, he seemed to say on the eve of the game, but as a manager you can fluke it with a few good players and a bit of luck. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Mourinho: Schalke can take comfort in losing to a perfect Chelsea .

BOOKINGS . MANAGER: Jose Mourinho 8. MOM: Willian . REF: Jonas Eriksson (Sweden) 6. Building a powerful team, however, one capable of dominating over time and bulldozing all before them? That is a different matter. Mourinho has the ability and he knows it. He has demonstrated it before and he is well on the way to repeating it. Smug? Perhaps, but this Chelsea team is something to be smug about. They are clear at the top of the Barclays Premier League and into the last 16 of the Champions League as Group G winners. Fluent and mobile, last night they tore Di Matteo’s Schalke to shreds with goals from John Terry, Willian, Didier Drogba, Ramires and an own goal — all while barely conceding a chance. ‘Very impressive, very complete,’ purred Mourinho. ‘Top quality football for 90 minutes. Very compact, very strong defensively, no mistakes. The team was so solid. Everything under control and the result is a consequence of one team that played a fantastic match.” Within the brutality there was beauty, the manager wanted to stress. ‘The players are very serious,’ he said. ‘Everything they do with big focus and ambition, but at the same time with this component which is something new in Chelsea football: this happiness, this flair, this beauty. The way they are doing things, we are very happy.’ For Di Matteo it must have been agony. From the moment Terry opened the scoring with a back-post header from a second-minute corner, the outcome was barely in question. At 1-0 Schalke’s Eric Maxim Choupo-Moting hit the bar from long range but after that the Londoners stretched the lead. Schalke were diabolical in defence, listless in attack and booed and whistled by their own fans, which only made them more anxious. The songs of support from Chelsea’s travelling support will have done little to ease the pain and humiliation for Di Matteo against the club he served so successfully as player and manager.

Goalkeeper Ralf Faehrmann  and Chelsea's Nemanja Matic watch as Terry's header hits the back of the net in Gelsenkirchen . Terry celebrates scoring Chelsea's fastest-ever goal in the Champions League to put his side in front in Germany . ‘We are sorry for this performance,’ said Di Matteo. ‘We showed them too much respect. We weren’t aggressive enough, we didn’t put enough pressure on them, and they were ice cold. It was a super, clinical performance from them. We conceded too much space and they have players able to exploit that.’ By the end the Italian must have wished his technical area would open up and swallow him. Or that he had delayed his return to management until after this game. ‘The best comfort they can have is that they lost to the best team,’ said Mourinho. ‘They must be very sad with this result, but my experience tells me that when we lose against a team that is much better, then you have to accept it. It was not their fault. Move on, win the next match and keep going.’ Willian sends a fierce drive into the net to double Chelsea's advantage as they slipped into cruise control in Germany .

That is the way Chelsea are going about their season. Unbeaten for 19 games in all competitions, they have not lost since April. Next up: another former Blues favourite, Gus Poyet, at Sunderland, who will tremble if he studies this game too closely. Chelsea’s second goal, from Willian, followed an exquisite move featuring Eden Hazard and Cesc Fabregas, although goalkeeper Ralf Fahrmann ought to have done better with the shot. The third crushed Schalke before the interval when Jan Kirchhoff headed into his own goal from another Fabregas corner. There was no yellow Chelsea shirt near Kirchhoff as he planted the ball into the top corner. More jeers followed Schalke’s players down the tunnel. Di Matteo may be cherished by Chelsea fans, but he has work to do if he is to win hearts in Gelsenkirchen. He made changes but Chelsea rolled on. Mourinho was able to take off Diego Costa, Oscar and Fabregas in the second half. Costa has a knock but is expected to be fit for Saturday’s game at Sunderland. As the match went into the final 15 minutes, Drogba tapped in the fourth, teed up by Willian, and then set up the fifth with a cross for Ramires to score with his head. Amid the emotion of Di Matteo and his reunion it was easy to overlook that Mourinho has his own special connection with Gelsenkirchen. It was here that he first won the Champions League with Porto, before walking out to take the job at Stamford Bridge.

"Died aged 91: Labour former Cabinet minister Lord Barnett was praised as an 'extraordinary individual' Labour former Cabinet minister Lord Barnett has died aged 91, his party said today. He was the Treasury chief secretary in the 1970s who devised the system for allocating public spending to Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland that came to be known as the Barnett Formula. The formula has remained in place, despite Lord Barnett’s arguments that it was a temporary fix and ought to be reformed as it now produces unfair results. Labour leader in the Lords Baroness Royall said: ‘Joel was an extraordinary individual. ‘As an MP, minister and colleague in the House of Lords, to the very end he was diligently holding the Government to account and doing his best to ensure the best for the people of this country.’ Lord Barnett's daughter Erica said he died peacefully at home on Saturday morning after a short illness. She said he retained his interest in politics during his illness and ‘the last words he spoke to me were about the European Union budget’. The upsurge in interest in the Barnett Formula following the Scottish Referendum - and the ‘vow’ by David Cameron, Ed Miliband and Nick Clegg to retain the system - had provided a ‘great boost’ to him, she said. He is pictured arriving at 10 Downing Street in London in 1976 during his time as Treasury chief secretary . Former Cabinet minister: Lord Barnett (left and right) died peacefully at home on Saturday after a short illness . Ms Barnett said: ‘The Barnett Formula thing during the Scottish referendum was a great boost to him, because he was able to say what he had been saying for a long time to anybody who would listen, but this time people were listening. ‘He had the chance finally to tell people just why he thought it was not only unfair but undemocratic.'

The extent to which the relevant English departmental programme is comparable with the services carried out by each devolved administration . x . The population proportion in each country . = . Increased spending for each country funded by central government . In September, Lord Barnett wrote in the Mail On Sunday that 'the Barnett Formula should be scrapped as soon as is practicable and replaced by a statutory body charged with distributing government spending in a way that the most money goes to areas that need it most'. He added: 'After 36 years, during which I have become increasingly ashamed of having my name attached to the current system, they are quite welcome to use my name for this replacement system. I have become thoroughly disillusioned with the old one.' Lord Barnett attended Manchester Central High School, and worked as an accountant in his early career - before first serving in politics as a councillor on Prestwich Borough Council in 1956. In 1964 he was elected MP for Heywood and Royton, and became Treasury chief secretary in 1974. He was Public Accounts Committee chairman in 1979, and was made a life peer in 1983. There was already a long-established convention for funding public spending in Scotland, based on the relative populations of England and Scotland almost a century before. I merely adjusted the figures to take account of changes in the relative populations of the four home nations and drew up the spending figures accordingly – which actually resulted in a 2 per cent reduction in funding for Scotland over the settlement they would have been due under the previous, outdated population statistics. My idea was to have the settlement ratified by the Cabinet, which it duly was. Then, I knew, the Scottish, Welsh and Northern Ireland Offices would have to take any claims for more money to Cabinet, rather than try to petition me. I never thought the arrangement – there was and is no proper ‘formula’ that works out how much money is needed and where it should be spent – would last any longer than a year or two, certainly not after the next General Election.","Lord Barnett of Labour was the Treasury chief secretary in the 1970s .

"Royal tours are often thought to be a modern phenomenon but as these rare photos demonstrate, the Royal Family has been travelling abroad on diplomatic missions for hundreds of years. But while the international efforts of the likes of Henry V and Elizabeth I are only remembered in paintings, the future Edward VII's 1862 tour of the Middle East was documented by a photographer - the first time a royal tour had been recorded this way. Like Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall in Mexico and Colombia, the then Prince of Wales spent much of his time meeting local dignitaries and politicians, although at four-months, the visit was considerably longer than today's short tours. Royal tour: The Prince of Wales (centre, in white) exploring the Pyramids at Giza (near Egyptian capital Cairo) on 5th March 1862 . Lunch in the Holy Land: Edward (second left) and his companions have lunch on the shores of the Sea of Galilee . And while modern royal tours have an entirely diplomatic function, Prince Albert - as he was then known - was sent abroad by his mother Queen Victoria for a different reason - to keep him occupied between finishing university and getting married. Despite coming just two months after the death of Prince Albert senior, Victoria was determined that the visit should go ahead. Travelling in unusually low-key style, the bereaved prince got around on horseback and slept in tents as he toured the region, meeting rulers, politicians and ambassadors as he went. Accompanying the two princes on the tour, which took in Egypt, Israel, Syria, Lebanon, Turkey and Greece, was photographer Francis Bedford who used techniques that had been pioneered barely 20 years before. At the time, the idea of photographing a royal tour was a new concept, with Bedford's presence on the tour the result of Queen Victoria and Prince Albert's interest in photography. Bedford had already impressed the Queen with his photographs of places associated with Prince Albert's childhood in Germany, an earlier royal commission which secured his place on the trip. Impressive: Edward and his companions take a break during their visit to the Temple at Karnak during his 1862 visit to Egypt . Striking: The temple complex, which is close to the modern city of Luxor, was founded in 3200 BC and is dedicated to Amun-Re . Pilgrimage: Also on Edward's agenda was a visit to Bethlehem (pictured) and Jerusalem, which today, is the capital of Israel . Busy: Although a diplomatic mission, the future Edward VII's trip to the Middle East was also designed, by his mother Queen Victoria, to keep him occupied . In mid-February 1862, the Photographic News announced that the Prince of Wales was to be accompanied by 'eight gentlemen only', including Mr Bedford, on a tour to be undertaken 'in as private a manner as possible'. The main purpose of Bedford's work was to capture historic and sacred landscapes – the young Prince and his companions appear in only three of the 191 surviving photographs, all of which are to go on display in the Queen's Gallery at Buckingham Palace from this weekend. Two of these were taken in Egypt, showing the party in front of the pyramids at Giza and at the Temple of Amun at Karnak, ancient Thebes. In the third, they are having lunch under a fig tree at Capernaum, on the northern shore of the Sea of Galilee. The rest of the photographs reflect a growing public demand for romantic images of biblical sites, Egyptian and Greek ruins, and mosques. By the 1860s leisure travel to the Middle East was increasing, stimulated by major archaeological discoveries in the region. The introduction of steamships to Alexandria in 1840 also gave Egypt's fledgling tourism industry a boost, thanks to the reduction in journey times which made the area more accessible for European pilgrims and tourists. In his lifetime, Francis Bedford was considered one of the greatest British photographers, and on his return from the Middle East many of his photographs of the royal tour were exhibited to the public in a gallery on New Bond Street. Among those now on display for the first time since then are views of the Colossi of Memnon and of the Temple of Horus at Edfu on the west bank of the Nile, in which Bedford's portable darkroom can be seen in the shadow of the temple. Bedford would have had to take a large amount of equipment with him, including plates, tripods, lenses, chemicals and a darkroom, as well as the camera itself. 'Today royal tours are widely photographed, and the pictures are transmitted instantly around the world,' comments curator Sophie Gordon. 'Bedford's photographs were not seen by the public until over a month after the royal party's return to England, but his presence on the tour was widely reported in the press. 'The intense interest in his work at the time shows just how innovative and ground-breaking a move it was to invite Bedford to accompany the tour.' But Bedford's photos aren't the only record of the tour. Prince Albert splashed out on antiquities, picking up ancient Egyptian papyri and other artifacts as he went along. One, which will go on display alongside Bedford's photographs, is an ancient Egyptian papyrus inscribed with the Amduat, a funerary text which describes the journey of regeneration of Re, the Egyptian sun god. Others include pottery vessels from an excavation on the island of Rhodes and a poignant marble fragment from Syria inscribed 'From the remains of the Christian Quarter at Damascus, May. 1862'. Then, as now, the country was beset by a bloody war, this time between the Christian Maronites and the Druze, which saw the Christian quarter in Damascus burned to the ground. All change: Modern royal tours attract hordes of photographers (back) and are both less formal and considerably shorter . Collector: Edward also used his tour of the Middle East as an opportunity to purchase antiquities such as this papyrus scroll . Ruler: The then Prince Albert later went on to rule King Edward VII and became father to George V and grandfather to George VI . Technology: Like his parents who championed photography, Edward VII loved new technology and championed the car .","The future Edward VII's tour of the Middle East in 1862 was the first to be documented by a photographer .

"Roberto di Matteo played it low-key before the kick-off, keeping his distance from Chelsea personnel. There were touchline hugs for doctors Paco Biosca and Eva Carneiro as he ducked down the tunnel after completing a pre-match interview and a brief hand-slap with Jose Mourinho who waited for him by the end of the tunnel but the Schalke boss kept well clear of the players until after the game.

Police said Monday they were reviewing video of a fight in a restroom at Levi's Stadium that left one man in serious condition . As punches are thrown other fans in the restroom can be heard urging those involved in the fracas to calm down. The person filming the footage turns the lens towards himself and says 'wow', just before the clip ends. The suspects, Dario and Amador Rebollero, fled from the bathroom but were soon caught inside the stadium, said Santa Clara police spokesman Lt. Kurt Clarke. One victim was treated and released and the other was in serious condition. The Rebolleros were booked into county jail on suspicion of felony assault, the San Jose Mercury News reported. Clarke would not reveal the source of the video and said he did not know whether the suspects have attorneys. Spokesman Bob Lange said the team is deeply concerned about the victims.

"Lewis Hamilton led a Mercedes one-two in Spanish Grand Prix practice on Friday while Red Bull's world champion Sebastian Vettel was sidelined with an electrical problem. Race favourite Hamilton was quickest in both sessions, 0.449 of a second faster than championship leading team mate Nico Rosberg in the afternoon and 0.868 ahead of McLaren's Jenson Button in the morning. While Hamilton pounded out the laps, ahead of a weekend that could bring him a fourth successive win, quadruple champion Vettel was little more than a spectator at the Circuit de Catalunya. Life in the fast lane: Lewis Hamilton is bidding for his fourth consecutive victory at Sunday's Spanish Grand Prix .

'Due . to an electrical problem that has damaged the wiring loom of Car No. 1, . Sebastian will not be able to take part in FP2,' Red Bull said before . the afternoon session started. 'The team will use the time to fix it to . be ready for FP3 tomorrow.' Blow: Sebastian Vettel stopped on track after completing only four laps in Friday's opening practice session .

Hamilton, . four points behind Rosberg after four races, went from strength to . strength with a fastest lap of one minute 27.023 seconds set six minutes . from the end in the morning.

"Host commentator . Click here to read Matt Barlow's match report . Mourinho tells Sky Sports: They did a fantastic match. This team is very mature and very confident. To win 5-0 away in Germany is not normal but it was very impressive. 87mins: Drogba almost latches on to a Ramires pass but Fahrmann rushes out to steel the ball way. 'Ole, Ole Ole, Chelsea Chelsea' sing the travelling fans. Drogba turns provider as he finds space on the left and chips the ball towards the back post for Ramires to head home. The man who won Chelsea the Champions League in 2012, has his fourth goal of the campaign after tapping home to end a brilliant Chelsea move. 75mins: Another change for Chelsea as Oscar is replaced by fellow Brazilian Ramires. 66mins: Change for Chelsea as Costa is given a rest and replaced by Drogba. Costa has been a constant threat but will be frustrated not to have scored his first Champions League goal in a Chelsea shirt. Matt Barlow: Diego Costa is furious with himself for missing the chance for Chelsea’s fourth. He was still cursing minutes later and probably did not need Willian chipping in with his opinion. Costa still waiting for his first CL goal for Chelsea. We’ll let him off. 63mins: Meyer replaces Boateng. 57mins: Costa keeps finding promising positions out on the left but Hoger has stuck to the Spanish striker reasonably well. Fabregas is dictating just how much effort Chelsea put into this second half. Matt Barlow: Di Matteo has switched Schalke to 442 for the second half with Clemens on for Kirchhoff and Choupo-Moting, perhaps their best player in the first half, sent up front with Huntelaar. It has made little impact. Chelsea look capable of scoring as many as they choose to score. 51mins: Terrific plays from Chelsea - Fabregas plays a long ball over to top to Costa who sees yet another shot block. The ball falls to Hazard and he jinks towards the byline only to see a cross cleared. 47mins: Costa says it's my turn now as he bullies Santana off the ball and drives into the box before the Schalke defender is able to get a foot in a clear the ball for a corner. Can the home side mount a comeback? It looks extremely unlikely... The Chelsea players look to be really enjoying their football at the moment. Click here to follow Sportsmail's live runner from the Etihad as City trail against 10-man Bayern Munich. Matt Barlow: Schalke booed and whistled off at half-time. It's a shocker for Schalke, who trail by three goals after a stunning first 45 minutes from Mourinho's side. Absolute disaster for Schalke. Fabregas swings in a corner, Santana gets in Kirchoff's way and between them manage to smash the ball into their own net. That's Chelsea through, surely. Matt Barlow: Schalke fans are turning on their team here, whistling at their slow and listless football. Atmosphere on the turn. Feels like White Hart Lane. He's done it! Messi is now the all-time top goalscorer in the Champions League with 72. Chelsea double their lead as Willian rifles a low drive past Fahrmann. The build-up from Mourinho's side was magnificent as Hazard and Oscar interchanged brilliantly. Suarez has his first goal in a Barca shirt and what a goal it was. The former Liverpool man found space on the left side of the box before changing his body shape and curling the ball into the net with his right foot. Judging by his celebrations, the Uruguayan enjoyed that one. 26mins: Boateng drifts a promising free-kick straight into the arms of Courtois. Blues still in total control here as Boateng loses possession once again. 22mins: Schalke are slowly starting to get a foothold on the game after a brilliant start from Chelsea. The Blues look so dangerous on the counter-attack, however, as Hazard links well with Hazard before seeing his shot blocked by Santana. 18mins: Hoger is shown a yellow card for a late challenge on Hazard. Matt Barlow: Chelsea fans singing 'One di Matteo' in the 16th minute. Nice touch. They’re being a bit drowned out by the Schalke drummers. RDM gives a thumbs up. 12mins: Schalke hit the crossbar as Choupo-Moting's shot deflects and loops over the head of Courtois. 9mins: Matic intercepts a pass in the centre before driving forwards and feeding an offside Costa. Shortly afterwards, Costa drives down the left, beats a man but his cut back is cleared =. 5mins: Chelsea come close to taking a 2-0 lead, but Ivanovic snatches at a volley from the centre of Schalke's penalty area. The Blues have been dominant during the early stages. Chelsea have an early lead and it's the captain with a trademark header from a Fabregas corner (another assist for the Spaniard). Terry jumped higher than his man at the far post to guide a header into the back of the net. Perfect start for Mourinho's men. We're underway in Schalke as the home side start with the ball. Matt Barlow: Jose Mourinho waits by the end of the tunnel to greet RDM before kick-off but the Schalke boss kept him waiting. They exchange the briefest of handshakes before heading to the benches. Matt Barlow: First chorus of 'One Di Matteo' heard from the Chelsea fans, penned in one corner of the Veltins Arena. More than 2,000 were expected from London. Certainly not that many in their seats at the moment. 10 mins to KO in Gelsenkirchen. Matt Barlow: Touchline hugs from Di Matteo for members of the Chelsea medical team after he completes a pre-match TV interview, but the Schalke boss is looking to play this low-key. Players are all out for warm-up. Chelsea in yellow tonight. Good to see Schalke seem to be in traditional blue & white, rather than that ridiculous green kit they like to wear in the Champions League. Courtois, speaking to Sky Sports, had a cheeky message for his colleague Mark Schwarzer, who is currently sitting in the Sky Sports studios. He joked: 'Sometimes I will complain about some pain in my foot or something and then I look at Mark and he's 42 so I can't complain!' Matt Barlow: The Veltins Arena is rocking out to a bit of Status Quo as the Schalke team emerge for their warm-up. It is one of the most atmospheric new areas in European football. The roof is open at the moment, but the locals can generate tremendous noise here. Chelsea – not a club familiar with the concept of the status quo – will be out to silence the place as they did last year with a 3-0 win . The Barcelona forward, who faces APOEL in Cyprus tonight, is currently tied with Real Madrid legend Raul on 71 goals, with Cristiano Ronaldo one behind. And Messi will be confident of breaking the record after scoring a hat-trick against Sevilla on Saturday which helped set a new La Liga goalscoring record of 253 goals. MATT BARLOW: Listen out in the 16th minute of Chelsea’s game against Schalke tonight and amid the usual din of the Veltins Arena there may be a ripple of applause and a chorus of 'One Di Matteo'. Chelsea supporters treat their legends with respect. Remember how they sang for Frank Lampard at Manchester City, even after he had scored a late equaliser against them. The 16th minute ovation in honour of Roberto Di Matteo’s shirt number became a staple of Chelsea games after he had been fired to make way for Rafa Benitez... Click on the link above to read more.
