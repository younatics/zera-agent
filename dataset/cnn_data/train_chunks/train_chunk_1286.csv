"In the past eight editions of the Champions League since 2007 there have been seven different winners but coached by only six talented men. The attraction of this week’s return to elite European football is that all four of those six winning coaches who remain active — Sir Alex Ferguson and Jupp Heynckes having retired — are immediately on Champions League duty. Pep Guardiola and Carlo Ancelotti — the two repeat winners with Barcelona (2009 and 2011) and AC Milan/Real Madrid (2007 and 2014) — face tantalising ties against familiar rivals. Bayern Munich coach Pep Guardiola faces tantalising tie against Shakhtar Donetsk . Their teams — Bayern and Madrid — deserve to be two of the firmest favourites to reach the Berlin Final, but dealing equally firmly with Shakhtar Donetsk and Schalke will be a task. Perhaps Jose Mourinho (winner with Inter, 2010) faces the match of the week, a proper test of Chelsea’s mettle in France against Paris Saint-Germain Meanwhile, Roberto di Matteo goes Italian v Italian as he tries to get Schalke to obliterate the 6-1 home defeat suffered against Ancelotti’s Real en route to the Spanish club winning this trophy a year ago. The di Matteo v Ancelotti battle is fascinating. They both played for a Roman team — AS Roma and Lazio. They both lifted UEFA silverware as midfielders. Both gave dignity and sweat to the Italian national team (just over 50 caps between them). Jose Mourinho's Chelsea face a proper test of their mettle in France against Paris Saint-Germain . Di Matteo played for Chelsea, both men coached that club and won trophies for the Romans’ empire. But there’s a separation, too. Ancelotti was born in the footballing heart of northern Italy. Di Matteo was born and raised in Switzerland. Some notional ‘background GPS’ isn’t detectably the reason for this, but Ancelotti is markedly thought of as the greater player. Was he a better footballer than di Matteo? That’s arguable. But the elder man had the good fortune to play in exceptional teams — principally Arrigo Sacchi’s Milan. Ancelotti was the axis around which a great deal of creativity and improvisation throbbed. Something which makes the lack of such a player in his current Real Madrid squad, since Xabi Alonso was sold, all the more irrational. Where di Matteo had great fortune was in inheriting a good group of players at Chelsea, a group which had started to lose patience under Andre Villas-Boas, but which had lost neither their talent or competitive edge. Ancelotti and di Matteo, who took the Schalke reins in October, have only competed head-to-head once before — on the opening day of the Premier League season in 2010. The 6-0 hiding which Ancelotti’s Chelsea gave West Brom hinted at a series of setback results, around the turn of the year, which saw di Matteo out of his job by February 2011. A mere 15 months later, di Matteo was dancing up the centre-stand steps at the AllianzArena in Munich, shouting to Roman Abramovich: ‘I won it!’ and lifting the Champions League trophy. Carlo Ancelotti will have to lift his Real Madrid players for Champions League encounter . The win had been fuelled by six of the same players — Petr Cech, John Obi Mikel, Ashley Cole, Frank Lampard, Florent Malouda and Didier Drogba — who had made his opening Premier League day with West Brom miserable. Di Matteo’s four-leaf clover when he took over at Chelsea was that Drogba, Terry, Lampard and Cech weren’t finished with the Champions League. However well he coached, they were footballers cut from the rock of ages. And they hadn’t stopped rocking. If he has a similarly-leaved lucky flora right now, it’s that this is exactly the right moment to face Real. Ancelotti admitted this weekend: ‘Since we won the world title in December, we have dropped our intensity and concentration.’ They keep dropping important players, too. Pepe might make it back for this match in Gelsenkirchen but that would constitute his first game in more than a month. Sergio Ramos, Luka Modric and James Rodriguez will all be missing — but it is the missing form of Ronaldo and Gareth Bale which is less finite and less easy to define or cure. Schalke may have been whipped 6-1 when Madrid last came to town. But this isn’t nearly the same demolishing machine. Real have looked mentally fatigued, less focused and without the claws which they used to savage both Schalke and Bayern in Germany last season — scoring 10 and conceding just once. Schalke boss Roberto di Matteo goes Italian vs Italian in showdown with Ancelotti’s Real Madrid . Di Matteo’s team isn’t identical to a year ago. But their recent 1-1 draw with Guardiola’s Bayern — a notable enough result given that it is the second time they have drawn wi th the reigning German champions this season — featured Benedikt Höwedes, Christian Fuchs, Joel Matip, Max Meyer, Kevin- Prince Boateng, and Roman Neustädter from the side that shipped six to Los Blancos. The Italian has made Schalke much more ordered, harder to beat and, until Klaas-Jan Huntelaar got himself banned for four games for a horrible foul on Manuel Schmiedebach, sharp up front. He has promoted from within, giving debuts to young goalkeeper Timon Wellenreuther in that draw with Bayern and Marvin Friedrich, a highly promising 19-year-old central defender. What di Matteo needs to use as his winning card, as far as the Schalke squad is concerned, is that Madrid’s form in Germany last season was the exception, not the rule. Real are on a nine-match winning streak in the Champions League, scoring 25 goals and conceding three. But prior to those two big wins in Germany last season, they had won just one of 25 away matches against Bundesliga sides — meaning their current domestic form isn’t quite how they would like to ‘present’. According to Madrid’s B-team coach, Zinedine Zidane, it’s a threatening tie. ‘I would like to say that Schalke has no chance and Real will safely reach the quarter-finals,’ he told Die Welt. ‘But in the knockout phase, anything can happen. In two games, you have double the chance of an outsider playing above themselves. So a team like ours must always be cautious, especially against Germans.’ Wise words. But he forgot to warn Ancelotti and Co to check if di Matteo is sporting a four-leaf clover in his lapel.","Pep Guardiola's Bayern Munich must deal with Shakhtar Donetsk .

"Given how he divides opinion, there’s probably the same number of people who feel sorry for Arjen Robben as there are who believe the 2022 World Cup should be in Qatar. Notwithstanding that the Dutchman is the footballer with the closest skill-and-thrill set to those of Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi, the fact that he is ruthlessly dedicated to persuading referees that any contact or attempted contact on him around the area is a penalty alienates many. However, anyone with an ounce of generosity, everyone who admires his fabulous combination of athleticism, pace, skill, technique and power should find it easy to generate some sympathy for the 30-year-old. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Robben score an incredible rabona in training . Arjen Robben trains with the Dutch squad at Katwijk ahead of their clash with Latvia . Guus Hiddink has promised to resign as Holland manager if his team are beaten by Latvia . Now that he has dominated his own physique, applying intelligence and research to avoiding being injured every four or five months, it is enormously frustrating to realise how much football he has missed. Instead of his reputation being given sheen by having been champion of every country in which he’s played (Holland, England, Spain and Germany), or having scored the winner in a Champions League final, the pall of blowing opportunities to achieve absolute greatness hangs stubbornly over him. Within five torrid weeks in spring 2012, he missed two penalties. First, against Borussia Dortmund, when a win would have put Bayern joint top of the Bundesliga but defeat doubled the existing three-point gap. In due course Jurgen Klopp’s team won the title. Robben has been with Bayern since 2009, where he has won three Bundesligas and the Champions League . The Dutch winger has won league titles in every country he has played, including two with Chelsea . Then, in that gut-wrenching, disastrous defeat at Bayern’s own stadium in the Champions League Final against Chelsea, Petr Cech easily saved Robben’s extra-time penalty at a time when Bayern were motoring and the Blues, frankly, didn’t look like they had another goal in them. Add that to the one-on-one miss against Iker Casillas in the 2010 World Cup Final against Spain. His career may be in full bloom but through Robben’s 21-trophy time line there emerges a thread of pain, disappointment, failure and ill-fortune. Just as he reaches the absolute peak of his form and fitness, the Dutch national team have become immensely idiosyncratic. They reached that World Cup final four years ago, but contested it like bar brawlers. Euro 2012 was horrific, but they ended Brazil 2014 in third place and just millimetres short of a place in the final, shredding Spain en route. Robben scores the winning goal against Borussia Dortmund in the 2013 Champions League final at Wembley . Robben gets his hands on the Champions League trophy after Bayern's win over Dortmund . Thus far, the post-World Cup era is nothing short of a botch-up — five defeats in the last seven matches, including a classic pratfall in Reykjavik against Iceland. Guus Hiddink has promised to quit should Holland lose to Latvia. Robben is an immense footballer yet, when the Ballon d’Or is awarded in January you can take it that he won’t be in the top three with Ronaldo (winner) and Messi (second). Bayern team-mates like Manuel Neuer and Philipp Lahm and Real’s Toni Kroos might be, while Gareth Bale is a decent bet to finish above Robben. The winger’s best finish is eighth. He says: ‘2013 was a brilliant year in terms of trophies. I won the Treble with Bayern. But in terms of my own professional development and sheer intensity, 2014 has been outstanding. The best yet. I’ve played all year without any major injuries and was on superb form physically during the World Cup.’ Robben sees a penalty against Chelsea in the 2012 Champions League final saved by Petr Cech . The Dutchman looked dejected after watching the Champions League slip away in Munich . Holland had a tough time at Euro 2012 as they lost all three games against Germany, Portugal and Denmark . Beyond ending his reputation of being made of crystal, physiologically, Robben has also shown steely fortitude mentally. ‘Spring and summer 2012 was a very difficult period. There were those penalties I missed and then, after the Champions League final defeat to Chelsea, we came back to a Holland friendly days later to suffer jeers and whistles in the Allianz Arena, our own stadium. ‘Then catastrophic games in Poland/Ukraine 2012 when Holland was knocked out in the first round. It was like living a nightmare. ‘Getting the decisive goal in the Champions League Final against Dortmund was such a liberating moment.’ And, compared to the threat of Latvia robbing Robben of another international manager, his club career at Bayern — good candidates for a second Treble in three years — could not be better. The Dutchman is in thrall to his club coach and admits Pep Guardiola has made him a better player. Developments for which Hiddink will be deeply grateful.","Dutch winger has stayed injury free and is playing some of his best football .

"Roma are considering a bid for Stoke City defender Ryan Shawcross. The Italian side were dumped out of the Champions League by Manchester City on Wednesday night and that could yet have a bearing on the timing of their bid but they have been watching the 27-year-old Stoke captain for three months. Although Mapou Yanga-Mbiwa signed from Newcastle on loan with view to a permanent deal he has failed to convince after a promising start and they want a defender who can prove more consistent to play alongside Kostas Manolas. Stoke City captain Ryan Shawcross celebrates at the final whistle after the victory over Arsenal on Saturday . Roma have already made discreet soundings over Shawcross and now what remains is whether they bid in January or the summer. Stoke do not want to lose the former Manchester United defender and will do their utmost to keep him. They are aware there is also interest from Newcastle and Everton but want him to remain as the foundation to Mark Hughes' team. Shawcross has ambitions to play for England again but has been frustrated after being continuously overlooked by Roy Hodgson, who was at the Britannia Stadium for Stoke's victory over Arsenal. Shawcross (centre) chases Arsenal's Danny Welbeck during the Premier League clash at the Britannia . He has been pushed to play for Wales by former boss Tony Pulis but has so far resisted. His only England appearance so far was as a substitute against a Zlatan Ibrahimovic-inspired Sweden in 2012. Another option for Roma is Tottenham defender Vlad Chiriches. The Romanian will leave White Hart Lane in January and also has interest from Borussia Dortmund and Bayer Leverkusen. The Italians remain keen on Chelsea goalkeeper Petr Cech but that is looking more like a deal for the summer. Tottenham Hotspur defender Vlad Chiriches (left) vies with Chelsea's Eden Hazard last week . Chelsea goalkeeper Petr Cech looks across the pitch during the Champions League match against Sporting . Newcastle's chief scout Graham Carr was a keen spectator as Aleksandar Mitrovic scored once again for Anderlecht on Wednesday night. Carr was not alone, with Leicester City also represented in the stands but Newcastle believe they hold the upper hand should they match Anderlecht's £12million valuation. Leicester have already been rejected by HNK Rijeka striker Andrej Kramaric. Mitrovic, the 20-year-old Serbia forward, grabbed the equaliser in the 1-1 draw at Borussia Dortmund, his 10th goal of the season. Anderlecht striker Aleksandar Mitrovic celebrates his goal against Borussia Dortmund on Tuesday . Meanwhile, Newcastle man of the moment Jak Alnwick is wanted by Queens Park Rangers. Although Harry Redknapp has Rob Green and Alex McCarthy on his books, he had invited Alnwick down to London to train before the 21-year-old got his breakthrough. Alnwick, brother of former Tottenham keeper Ben, impressed as a substitute in the 2-1 win over Chelsea but is out of contract in the summer. Newcastle have already turned down one loan offer for him. Newcastle United goalkeeper Jak Alnwick has his eye on the ball during training on Thursday . Aston Villa and Sunderland have joined Hull by showing interest in Manchester United's Darren Fletcher. The 30-year-old has six months left on his contract at Old Trafford and is at a crunch time in his career. He wants to stay at United but also wants to play and his opportunities have been limited owing to the signings of Ander Herrera and Daley Blind. A raft of injuries have presented him with chances from the bench but other Premier League sides are willing to give him the chance to play more regularly. Manchester United's Darren Fletcher (right) chases Stoke's Marko Arnautovic at Old Trafford last week . Fletcher enjoys life under Louis van Gaal and is a popular member of the United dressing room. Chances may become more limited though, as the club still intend to bring in another midfielder with Kevin Strootman of Roma a summer target. Fletcher is 31 in February and will weigh up offers over the coming weeks. United are aware Nemanja Vidic is unsettled at Inter Milan. However, a return looks unlikely at this stage. His agent Silvano Martina joked: 'The boy is already training with the Red Devils,' before qualifying 'Not at all. It is all lies. Vidic has a three year deal with Inter and does not move from Milan. It is a nonsense.' Talking to Calciomercato.com, Martina added: 'I do not even see the need to push him to other teams. I repeat, he does not move from Inter.' Inter Milan's Nemanja Vidic controls the ball during a training session in Appiano Gentile Como last week . Dinamo Moscow are the latest club to show an interest in Lukas Podolski. The Germany forward scored on his return to the starting line-up against Galatasaray but is well-known to be unhappy with his limited opportunities in Arsene Wenger's first team. Interest also remains from Germany and Turkey for the 29-year-old but Dinamo can pay a lucrative salary. Podolski's team-mate Tomas Rosicky, 34, is continuing to attract interest from franchises in the MLS. The Czech turned down the chance to go Stateside last December before agreeing a one-year contract extension. Lukas Podolski (centre) scores Arsenal's fourth goal against Galatasaray on Tuesday night . Leeds United midfielder Rudy Austin is a target for Championship rivals Brighton. The Jamaica star has played 15 games this season and scored one goal but Leeds are looking to re-shape their squad as they post financial figures outlining a £23million loss. Massimo Cellino has told the club's board that he will comply with a Football League directive ordering him to quit as a director within 28 days to prevent them from incurring sanctions during his appeal against disqualification. However, the Italian wants a large playing squad reduced. Austin, 29, is a combative player who can also fill in at centre back or right wing back. Brighton manager Sami Hyypia is under pressure to turn results around with his side third from bottom and hopes Austin can add extra grit to their fight for survival. Leeds United's Rudy Austin in action during a Championship clash against Sheffield Wednesday in October . Premier League clubs are taking a keen interest in Ajax striker Arkadiusz Milik. The 20-year-old is on loan from Bayer Leverkusen but is outstripping the statistics of Luis Suarez and Zlatan Ibrahimovic at the same age at Ajax. The Poland striker has scored 17 goals in 16 games compared with eight over 16 games for Suarez at the age of 20 and six for Ibrahimovic at the same stage. His assists are also up with seven next to six for Suarez after 16 games and two for Ibrahimovic. He averages a goal every 41 minutes. Liverpool, Everton and Arsenal all watched Milik when he was at Gornik Zabrze, keen to find the next Robert Lewandowski. However, he chose Leverkusen where he initially failed to impress. Ajax took a chance and have an option to sign Milik at the end of the season. Leverkusen though may see how his season develops before agreeing the sale. Ajax striker Arkadiusz Milik (right) shoots and scores against Apoel in Amsterdam on Wednesday night . Southampton are looking to sign a midfielder on loan in January as they battle to hold on to Morgan Schneiderlin. The France man is expected to attract fresh bids from Tottenham next month but Southampton want to hold on to him until the summer. They hope to rekindle their push for a Champions League place and want Schneiderlin to help them before taking stock of his options in May. A loan option will bolster their squad and allow them room for manoeuvre should Schneiderlin have his head turned in January. Southampton's Morgan Schneiderlin (centre) catches up with Luke Shaw (right) at St Mary's on Monday night . Crystal Palace have stepped up interest in Swansea pair Bafetimbi Gomis and Neil Taylor but it is understood they are unsure about a move to Selhurst Park. Palace want a striker and a left back and Swansea would listen to reasonable offers with Gomis having a £7million release clause. However, both players have other Premier League admirers and want to see what other offers arrive.

"It was a performance to set a new high watermark on what you can legitimately expect from a footballer returning after one of the most brutally debilitating injuries imaginable. Fifty-six minutes into Real Madrid’s cup tie with minnows Cornella, Sami Khedira’s accidental collision with Israel Delgado brought Los Blancos’ chunky little barrel of talent and fun, Jese Rodriguez, back to the promised land. The concussed German exited groggily and the stocky Spaniard burst back on to the scene eight months after his own unfortunate collision with a German — Schalke’s Sead Kolasina — ruptured the anterior cruciate ligament of his right knee. Jese Rodriguez returned to the Real Madrid side after a knee injury kept him out since March . No comparison is precise but - during the previous 27 matches of the 21-year-old’s debut season, producing eight goals - there were hints of Wayne Rooney’s extraordinary blend of power and technique at a juvenile age, plus delicate flavours of the cheek, love of life and showmanship of the young Paul Gascoigne. Whether this kid, who himself had produced a kid before he even played first-team football (little Jese), and who is already through the ‘musical differences’ break-up in the first part of his budding pop career, can reach the same eights as Gazza or Wazza remains to be seen. He may have been missing from Saturday night’s 3-0 win at home to Celta Vigo — which saw Real equal a Spanish record 18th-straight victory in all competitions and Cristiano Ronaldo complete his 23rd treble with his 200th Spanish top-flight goal, giving him more hat-tricks than any other La Liga player — yet he has talent in abundance. The Real Madrid fans celebrate Jese's return to action . Which takes us back to Tuesday night and the paroxysms of joy into which the 50,000 crowd were sent by their returning prodigy. After a missed touch here and a twinge there, he produced the ‘nutmeg’ of the European season. Miles better than Ricardo Kishna the other weekend for Ajax. Jese drew David Garcia to him, turned his back on the defender so that — unlike Kishna — he couldn’t even see his opponent or his stance then, ‘blind’, used the instep of his right boot to chop the ball between Garcia’s legs before running around the player to regain possession. The Bernabeu has seen some things in its time, but the ghosts of Ronaldo, Guti, Zidane, Schuster and Fernando Redondo joined in the ooohing, aaahhing and ‘Olé-ing’ which the trick drew from the crowd. That Jese crashed in a rightfooted goal from Isco’s assist to make the final score 5-0 wasn’t just icing on the cake. One of the things which sets the pulse running about this buzz-bomb is that, despite the fact that technical ability and a taste for the spectacular both ooze out of his pores, he’s no show-pony. Dedicated to winning, properly focused on elbowing his way into the Madrid first team and staying there, he’s a scamp. There’s a bit of the Artful Dodger about him, but he plays to win rather than to dazzle. Jese has been likened to Manchester United's Wayne Rooney . Jese has shown similarities to Paul Gascoigne in the way he plays . Even at the age of 21, this injury has been a massively costly setback for the kid from the Canary Islands — and for the teams he’d have played for. It cost him a Copa del Rey winners’ medal and a Champions League medal — having previously contributed to Madrid’s trajectory to the finals, he lost the pride of playing in the showpiece matches against Barcelona and Atlético Madrid. Real, too, lost out. Their title stumble came, in sight of the tape, when just two more goals — at home to Valencia and away to Valladolid — would have given them four more points. Enough to win the title, meaning that they would also have won their first ever Treble. Would Jese have guaranteed those late season goals when others, older than him, were tired and creaky? Maybe not. Was his season shaping up to write that kind of script? Yes. So explosive was his form, socontagious his Kama Sutra of goals (scoring from four different positions, left wing, right wing, centre-forward and No 10) that, by early winter 2013, Vicente del Bosque was raising the idea of taking him to Spain’s defence of their World Cup. There is a lot of excitement around Jese's return from injury . Might La Roja have been better off with a lad exuding burgeoning confidence, dancing past opponents and scoring outrageous goals? Answers on a postcard. Of course, there was another cost. The mental one. Within a couple of weeks of his first operation, in Germany, a nasty infection set in and a second operation was needed. The coach who had been most influential in Jese’s development was Alberto Toril — now sacked from his job in charge of Real Madrid Castilla. Toril suffered this injury himself, twice, while a player and spent much of the summer helping the youngster cope with the psychological trauma it brings. ‘Knee-ligament injuries aren’t just damaging physically, but mentally, too,’ Toril noted. ‘You go through huge ups and downs, times when the healing goes quickly and times when there seems to be no prospect of advances. Psychological strength is vital. Over the months, I’ve managed to help him keep his equilibrium.’ During those months, his house went on fire and he had to move in next door with Álvaro Arbeloa. Also, Jese’s pop group, Big Flow, broke up. He’s now a solo artist who wants to go by the soubriquet of ‘Jey M’. Some of his Teflon confidence comes from the fact that, in Jese’s first five seasons at the club, he won five straight leagues and became a European champion with Spain at Under-19 level. He has the winning habit and knows what it takes to be a champion. Not all do. Some grim days recently in Spanish football — offset and lightened by the return of a phenomenal young buck. Someone who carries the very essence of football in his soul and in his boots.","Jese Rodriguez made his return to the Real Madrid team after being out with a  knee injury .

"At the PFA’s annual ceremony in April 2013, Sir Alex Ferguson was invited on to the stage with the Class of 92 to collect a special merit award. With a room full of several hundred people slapping him on the back as he made his way up to the receive the award, it would have been very easy for him to take all the glory. Instead, as Ryan Giggs, Gary Neville and Paul Scholes looked on, Ferguson spoke about the men who really did discover the group of players who trialled each night at Albert Park in Salford in the late Eighties. Jordon Ibe earned rave reviews for his performance against Southampton at the weekend and the man who brought him to Liverpool's attention  - Mel Johnson - deserves huge praise for his discovery . Sir Alex Ferguson recognised the work of Eric Harrison (left), who brought through the Class of 92, when the then-Manchester United manager and his youth coach received merit awards at the PFA bash in 2013 . ‘We decided to invest in youth and Eric Harrison was a master,’ admitted Ferguson. ‘Everyone worked so hard. ‘I brought in Les Kershaw, we coached, we trialled every night every week, and the trialling was producing unbelievable players.’ It was one of those nights when most people in the room were simply happy to be in the company of the United manager. He could easily have edited the story. Instead, his speech was humble and well-meaning as he referenced the men who helped to make it all happen for Manchester United. Credit, where credit is due, and good on him for that. The modern trend is very different, with the scouts and development coaches who signed, recommended or brought through some of these young players scandalously overlooked in the final analysis. Ibe put in an 'amazing' shift against the Saints, according to Jamie Carragher and Thierry Henry . Raheem Sterling blazed a trail for young players at Liverpool under Brendan Rodgers' management . Mel Johnson is one of hundreds of scouts who hammer it up and down motorways each week to act on tip-offs to watch young players. This guy should be chair-lifted into Anfield at every home game and given the best seat in the house for the discovery of Jordon Ibe and Sheyi Ojo. Johnson flagged both to Liverpool when he arrived at the club shortly after the appointment of Damien Comolli as technical director in 2010. Stuart Webber, another former Liverpool scout also played a significant role in the recruitment of Ojo from MK Dons, along with Jerome Sinclair, who is scoring goals for fun in the Development league, from West Brom. Ibe was first spotted by Johnson when he worked in the south of England, where he was employed as chief scout for the former QPR manager Ian Holloway. A few years later, when Comolli took Johnson to Liverpool as one of his primary scouts, they made their move because the club had moved towards a different recruitment strategy under Fenway Sports Group. Ibe, who arrived at Anfield from Wycombe in 2011, was handed his debut by Brendan Rodgers at the end of the 2012-13 season and is pictured here starring in the NextGen Series against Marseille in 2012 . England international Sterling joined Liverpool's academy from Queens Park Rangers in 2010 and was just 17 when pictured celebrating a goal against Southend in the FA Youth Cup at Anfield the following year . Damien Comolli was the man responsible for taking talent-spotter Johnson to Liverpool . Liverpool offered Wycombe £750,000 for Ibe; Tottenham offered £75,000, or thereabouts. Ibe is attracting a lot of attention at the moment, particularly after another eye-catching performance for Liverpool during their 2-0 victory at Southampton on Sunday. Sportsmail columnist Jamie Carragher and former Arsenal striker Thierry Henry reflected on his ‘amazing performance' during their analysis for Sky Sports on Sunday. Ibe made his debut in May 2013, picked by Rodgers for a 1-0 victory over QPR at Anfield before he went on loan to Birmingham and Derby County. In nine appearances he has never lost in a Liverpool shirt. No-one deserves more credit than the player himself for his development, but others have played their part in his progress. Sometimes they deserve a pat on the back, too. Kenny Dalglish was short of numbers for a six-a-side game at Melwood when he fetched Ibe over to play with the senior players for the first time in 2012. Ibe showed no anxiety, announcing himself to a group of players that included Luis Suarez by scoring in the top corner, first with his left foot and then with his right. When Suarez asked how old he was, the Uruguay forward refused to believe that Ibe was only 16. ‘At least 18,’ was Suarez’s response. Nobody knew too much about this kid from the Liverpool academy and nobody was quite sure where he had come from. Ibe impressed former Liverpool striker Luis Suarez when he trained with him at Melwood for the first time . Ibe helped Birmingham avoid relegation on the final day of last season during his loan spell at St Andrew's . The youngster also had a successful spell at Derby before Brendan Rodgers recalled him last month . In the mists of time, along with the constant shuffling and sacking of staff (Johnson was fired by Liverpool in November 2014), it is easy to forget the men who made it all possible. Frank McParland, who was the club’s academy director, and Comolli have left Anfield. Stuff happens, people fall out of favour, they may well accept that. Their legacy, though, is hugely talented, young English players, who are being given the opportunity to thrive under Brendan Rodgers. Ibe has forced his way into the first team after returning from a successful loan spell at Pride Park. Ibe, in derby action against Everton, has played nine times for Liverpool's first team and has never lost . The huge turnover of staff at the top Premier League clubs means that it would very easy to forget Ibe’s journey from Wycombe Wanderers, where he made a handful of appearances, to first-team player at Liverpool. ‘You don’t want to miss out on a 17-year-old at Brentford, so you go to watch,’ admitted Johnson in a recent interview. ‘You have to go to games, you have to go with your gut instincts.’ When it comes to his work at Liverpool, guys like Johnson deserve a special merit award. Sheyi Ojo, playing in an Under 18 match against Spurs last year, is tipped for a bright future at Liverpool .

"It's Hot or Not time again as Ian Ladyman reveals what's been making him feel warm this week and what's been leaving him cold inside. There's a Scottish manager manager who is impressing in East Anglia and a Spanish boss who brought some style to Manchester, plus a broadcaster put before the Twitter jury for his lack of film knowledge. WHAT'S HOT . LUIS ENRIQUE . The Barcelona coach took touchline chic to new levels when he appeared at Manchester City looking set for a night out in the nearby Northern Quarter. Memo to Manuel Pellegrini: Don’t try and copy this look. Barcelona manager Luis Enrique looked ready for a night out while standing on the touchline at the Etihad . ALEX NEIL . Where are all the bright, young British managers? In the Championship, it seems. The latest is 33 and manager of Norwich City. He has won seven out of nine since taking over and previously managed at Hamilton Academical. No, I’ve absolutely no idea how they found him either. Alex Neil has made a good start to life as Norwich manager . BRENTFORD . Still in the Championship, Mark Warburton’s team caught the eye with a remarkable 42 shots in their win at Blackpool. A question, though. Given that only four of them went in, what on earth happened to the other 38? Brentford's Jon Toral celebrates scoring a hat trick goal in Brentford's 4-0 win over Blackpool . PAUL GASCOIGNE . A coup for BT to coax Gazza on to the ‘Fletch & Sav’ programme and a blessing to see him looking so well. Those who dismiss him as a dim-witted boozer should read his book. They may think again. It’s only because of his remarkable spirit that a true genius is still with us at all.

Manchester United have more wide men than an episode of Fat Club and this one has complained that Louis van Gaal has not been in touch during his spell at Sporting Lisbon. He also mentions, in the same interview, that he has changed his phone number. Nani says he has not spoken to Manchester United manager Louis van Gaal during his time at Sporting . THE CAPITAL ONE CUP FINAL . We love the League Cup and Sunday’s final should provide a decent showpiece. What a shame, then, that it may be overshadowed by the two Premier League matches taking place on the same day. Why is this allowed to happen? London rivals Chelsea and Tottenham will do battle at Wembley on Sunday for the first piece of silverware . CARDIFF CITY . Owner Vincent Tan maintains a strong interest in the affairs of Malky Mackay, the man sacked when the club was 17th in the Premier League last season.

"England will face Italy, Portugal and Sweden in the group stage of next summer's European Under-21 Championship finals in the Czech Republic. Gareth Southgate's seeded side were pitched into battle with the Italians, the Portuguese - whom they play in a friendly at Turf Moor on November 13 - and the Swedes in Group B in the draw, which was performed by former Czech star Pavel Nedved in Prague on Thursday afternoon. The host nation, the top seed in Group A, will face Germany, Denmark and Serbia in the competition, which takes place in Prague, Olomouc and Uherske Hradiste between June 17 and 30. Gareth Southgate's side will Italy, Portugal and Sweden in the group stage of the U21 Finals Championship . Former Czech Republic legend Pavel Nedved chats to UEFA President Michel Platini during Thursday's draw . Southgate urged England’s Under 21 team to show they can win on the biggest stage. ‘It is a cracking group, a group to get excited about,’ said the coach. ‘Yes, they are difficult teams but they are bound to be if you get to this stage. It is on to the next challenge. ‘We are effectively in the quarter-finals of this competition and I have never heard of anyone having any easy time at this stage. That is the mentality we have got to have. If we want to win the tournament, which we do, then we cannot complain about who we have got to play.’ Italy are five times winners of the competition and runners-up in 2013, when they were beaten by Spain in Israel, while Portugal lost in the 1994 final two years after Sweden had done the same. West Brom striker Saido Berahino starred for Southgate's side in qualification scoring 10 times on the way . England are twice winners, but their last success came three decades ago in 1984. Southgate's team dropped only two points in qualification, courtesy of a 1-1 draw in Finland in September last year, winning their remaining nine games, with West Brom striker Saido Berahino scoring 10 times on the way. Having topped Group One, they booked their place in the finals with home and away play-off victories over Croatia. But Portugal boasted a perfect record, collecting a maximum 24 points from their eight qualifiers and winning both legs of their play-off against Holland, the only nation to do so.","Gareth Southgate's side drawn in tough pool for 2015 tournament .

"It's Hot or Not time again as Ian Ladyman reveals what's been making him feel warm this week and what's been leaving him cold inside. There's a Dutchman who used to have an orange glow and is now burning bright on the south coast plus a tennis legend, a £25million Premier League hot-shot and a couple of familiar faces who are never short of something to say. WHAT'S HOT . RONALD KOEMAN . The Southampton manager is not a stranger to winning. If you spent enough time hanging around the first team at Ajax, Barcelona and Holland in the 80s and 90s then the chances are you won't have wasted your time and Koeman's CV contains two European Cup triumphs, a clutch of Spanish trophies and a European Championship win from 1988. At the age of 51, though, Koeman is midway towards what would perhaps be one of his greatest achievements. Ronald Koeman (centre) has Southampton looking comfortable in the Champions League places . Dusan Tadic (No 11) was the hero for Koeman's side last week as he scored to sink top-four rivals Man United . The Dutchman was already a European Cup winner with PSV Eindhoven when he scored the only goal for Barcelona - a typical Koeman free-kick - against Sampdoria under the Twin Towers at Wembley in 1992 . He was celebrating then and he's still celebrating now... Saints boss Ronald Koeman knows how to win . When his Southampton team started the season like a train, we presumed they would prove to be nothing more than pleasant diversion from the norm. Here we are heading towards February, though, and last weekend's win at Manchester United has seen Koeman's team ease in to third place in the Barclays Premier League. Southampton in the Champions League? Koeman's record would perhaps suggest that is where he belongs. ROGER FEDERER . If you want to know the toll a life on the professional tennis circuit takes on the mind and body then consider the fact that Bjorn Bjorg has been selling underpants for the last two decades. The worshipped Swedish baseliner may not be typical but the fact he retired at the age of 26 tells you something about how hard it is to extend a career at the top of the men's game year after year. You're never too old for a bit of showboating as Roger Federer practises ahead of the Australian Open . His game hasn't changed much but he's ditched the hairdo he had when he won his first Wimbledon in 2003 . John McEnroe - who did as much as anyone to hurry Bjorg in to retirement - kept his career going until he was 32 but the fact his singles ranking had dropped to 20 by the time he took his racket home suggests he had carried on a little too long. Others went earlier. Stefan Edberg at 30, Boris Becker at 31. So what do we make of Federer's remarkable longevity in the week that he racked up his 1,000th victory? Federer is second-favourite - behind Novak Djokovic - to win the season's first grand slam in Melbourne . Federer will be approaching his 34th birthday by the time this summer's Wimbledon rolls round but, ranked two in the world and second-favourite for the forthcoming Australian Open, is showing no signs of slowing down. Maybe a clue to it all is buried in the stats. Of the 1000 wins on tour, only 22 have ever gone to five sets. Maybe it's just been too easy all these years. MANCHESTER CITY . It may seem a little odd to shine a positive light on the Barclays Premier League champions in the week that they were shown to have bungled their way to a succession of untruths regarding the status of Frank Lampard. Certainly, their PR department have had better weeks. Wilfried Bony will return from the Africa Cup of Nations as a Manchester City player after his £25m move . Fernandinho (left) and Sergio Aguero have just head that City have snapped up a 20-goals-a-year striker . Nevertheless, all that will really matter to Manuel Pellegrini and the club's fans are prospects on the field and it may be that the signing of striker Wilfried Bony this week has changed the landscape of the domestic season significantly. For all Chelsea's formidable power, it is hard to escape the feeling they rely rather too heavily on the prolific Diego Costa for goals and momentum. If they lose him to injury, we may see a different Chelsea. City, though, now have four of 2014's top five Premier League goal scorers in their ranks and if that isn't a fact to serve notice of their ongoing financial might - whatever the calculators of UEFAS FFP officials may say - then I don't know what is. Bony, or Wilfried, either way his name was on a Premier League scoresheet 20 times in 2014 . WHAT'S NOT . QUEENS PARK RANGERS . While discussing his team’s troubles in the Premier League so far this season, Joey Barton suggested it was time for the players to: ‘Show some b******s’. While such basic urgings do little to further Barton’s claims to be one of our national sport’s great thinkers, they also miss the point rather. Joey Barton and QPR have lost every Premier League game they've played away from home this season . QPR’s issues at the foot of the league – they have lost all of their 10 away games so far – have little to do with their courage, motivation or determination and more with the fact that they just aren’t good enough. Last season in the Championship, Harry Redknapp’s squad was bursting with extremely well-paid household names – many of whom had Premier League experience – yet they still managed to finish fourth, 13 points behind Burnley, in second, and a staggering 22 behind winners Leicester. That, really, should have told us all we needed to know. Average teams don’t become good teams overnight, no matter how big their ‘b******s’ are. DARRAGH MACANTHONY . The Peterborough chairman and owner has ploughed enough of his own money in to his football club to have earned the right to say whatever he likes when things don’t go the way of Darren Ferguson’s team down in League One mid-table. However, the 38-year-old may wish to ponder whether his latest Twitter rantings at his failing players are likely to have any effect. Darragh MacAnthony launched a scathing Twitter attack... and if you want to read it, just look below . Here is the list of the 14 tweets from disgruntled Peterborough chairman Darragh MacAnthony on Saturday . Any FA charge that follows his 11-tweet outburst won’t bother him but it’s hard to escape the feeling that his players perhaps won’t respond in the way he wishes them to. You only have to go back to November 22 for the previous time he took Ferguson’s team to task on Twitter – after a 2-1 defeat by Swindon – and the response to that was a run of results that currently reads LLWLLDL . The problem with the ‘shock’ tactic is that you only really have one shot at it. If it doesn’t work and you keep on ranting, you look less like the master motivator and more like the nutter in the corner. KEVIN PIETERSEN . Australia’s wonderful ‘Big Bash’ competition presented us with the chance to witness a riveting 20-minute exchange between Ricky Ponting and Kevin Pietersen as they shared a commentary box in Melbourne on Tuesday morning. The first thing we learned is that Ponting may have a future as an interviewer, the former Australia captain proving as determined and unforgiving with the microphone as he did with a bat over his two-decade career. As far as an England recall is concerned, it's time for Kevin Pietersen to let it go . The second is that Pietersen can be diplomatic when he tries. Pushed by Ponting to name players in the England set-up with bigger egos than his own, Pietersen declined. When the subject of Andrew Strauss was raised, meanwhile, he described him as a 'lovely guy'. Sadly, though, Pietersen will continue to lose admirers as long as he continues to talk dreamily about a return to the England side. The former England skipper may or may not be right when he says there are many who want to see him back in the set-up but there are certainly many who don’t and that – sadly for him – would appear to include the selectors. Time for him to let it go before it gets embarrassing.","European Cup king Ronald Koeman may have another crack at the big one .

"The Dark Lady who inspired some of Shakespeare’s romantic sonnets may have had a rather unladylike profession. An expert on the Bard suggests she may have been a notorious prostitute called ‘Lucy Negro’ or ‘Black Luce’ who ran a brothel in Clerkenwell, London. Shakespeare scholar Dr Duncan Salkeld said he had unearthed documents that indicate she is ‘the foremost candidate for the dubious role of the Dark Lady’. New research claims The 'Dark Lady' of Shakespeare's sonnets was a notorious London prostitute named Lucy Negro or Black Luce - a dark-skinned madam who ran a licentious house in Clerkenwell. Above, the Bard in London . Many of the sonnets 127 to 152 are addressed to an unidentified woman with whom Shakespare imagines having an affair. In Sonnet 144 the temptress is . referred to as ‘my female evil’ and ‘my bad angel’. The identity of the . Dark Lady has mystified academics for years. To her contemporaries, she was known . as 'an arrant whore and a bawde’, catering for everyone from ‘ingraunts’ (immigrants) to ‘welthyemen’ and the aristocracy. The sonnets give few details describing her, apart from her dark eyes, hair and complexion, with hints that she was married. This identity was tentatively suggested in the 1930s but Dr Salkeld has now found public records that convince him that she is 'the foremost candidate for the dubious role of the Dark Lady', the Independent reported. Dr Duncan Salkeld discovered part of the evidence in the diary of Philip Henslowe, the theatre owner who built the Rose Theatre (right) and whose acting company was a rival to Shakespeare’s. Left, Geoffrey Rush as Henslowe in the film Shakespeare In Love . The first of the so-called 'Dark Lady' poems... In the old age black was not counted fair, . Or if it were, it bore not beauty's name; . But now is black beauty's successive heir, . And beauty slandered with a bastard shame: . For since each hand hath put on Nature's power, . Fairing the foul with Art's false borrowed face, . Sweet beauty hath no name, no holy bower, . But is profaned, if not lives in disgrace. Therefore my mistress' eyes are raven black, . Her eyes so suited, and they mourners seem . At such who, not born fair, no beauty lack, . Sland'ring creation with a false esteem: . Yet so they mourn becoming of their woe, . That every tongue says beauty should look so. The Bard imagines an unidentified . woman - known as the 'Dark Lady' but not actually named by him in that . way - in an adulterous sexual relationship. She is the inspiration for many of the sonnets 127 to 152. She is 'my female evil' and 'my bad angel' in sonnet 144. Dr . Salkeld discovered part of the evidence in the diary of Philip . Henslowe, the theatre owner who built the Rose Theatre and whose acting . company was a rival to Shakespeare’s. Within its pages, there is mention of both Black Luce and her associate Gilbert East, who operated another Clerkenwell brothel. Henslowe, who staged at least one of Shakespeare’s plays - Titus Andronicus - recorded 30 occasions when he dined with a Gilbert East who was also Henslowe’s bailiff for properties that he owned. The discovery that Luce and East were also Henslowe’s tenants adds a definitive link to Shakespeare’s world, according to the scholar. Dr Salkeld said: 'The name ""Gilbert East"" is rare in London parish records and we are on safe ground in taking the brothel-owner to be East. It proves the connection between East and Henslowe.' He adds: 'To my knowledge, no one has spotted this connection before.' Lucy also appears in a list of bawdy entertainments – the Gray’s Inn Christmas entertainments of 1594 – and in a few plays and literary texts of the period. Apart from a midnight raid on her premises, Luce is not recorded as being arrested, though her girls were, and court documents include references to her successful brothel. He says: 'Black Luce’s bad name was so well-known that anyone reading Shakespeare’s… sonnets… in the 1590s and early 1600s is likely to have brought her to mind, and Shakespeare must have known this.' Lucy Negro also appears in a list of bawdy entertainments - the Gray's Inn Christmas entertainments of 1594 - and in a few plays and literary texts of the period. Above, Hogarth's A Harlot's Progress from the 1700s . During Britain's involvement in the slave trade in the 16th century, thousands of  African and Afro-Caribbean slaves were ferried to London ports - on the same ships that brought imperial products such as tea, sugar, cotton and rum. Those who came to Britain were often brought in by naval officers and government officials returning to the UK. Some black people were offered to the commanders of slaving vessels as gifts, and were later sold into domestic service. Slavery was legal in Britain until 1772, and many of these Africans found themselves working as butlers or other household attendants in noble families. In 1764 The Gentleman's Magazine reported that there was 'supposed to be near 20,000... Negroe servants' in London: the magazine went on to say that 'the main objections to their importation is, that they cease to consider themselves as slaves in this free country, nor will they put up with an inequality of treatment, nor more willingly perform the laborious offices of servitude than our own people'. Acknowledging that trying to unravel . the Dark Lady is controversial, he concludes that there is sufficient . 'circumstantial' evidence: 'Whoever that person was, Shakespeare painted . her with the reputation of Luce… This is new evidence.' The link to Clerkenwell is further strengthened by Shakespeare’s own connections with the area. Not only did he know people who lived there, but he may also have had his own relatives there. In parish records, Dr Salkeld found several Shakespeares, including a Matthew Shakespeare who was married to an Isabel Peele – sister of the dramatist George Peele, who probably collaborated with the Bard on Titus Andronicus. In a London with only 200,000  population, such connections are significant. Dr Salkeld also notes the lack of evidence for the supposition that prostitutes circulated around Southwark and Bankside, the site of the Elizabethan Rose and Globe theatres: 'The stews were closed down by Henry VIII in 1546 and that drastically inhibited prostitution activity in the area. 'The majority of cases were north of The Thames, including Clerkenwell.' His new research will be published by Ashgate in Shakespeare Among the Courtesans in October.","Madam, also known as Black Luce, was 'an arrant whore' who ran a brothel in Clerkenwell, north-east London .

"The world of football punditry is certainly a wacky one at the moment. In the olden days, the expert would more often than not pick their team, then stick with it. Nowadays though, that badge they kiss might as well be on velcro as they suddenly turn up worrying about quite how flat a back four is for all manner of channels. With the ex-pros over at Sky Sports providing a notable exception, it would seem the story is very much, have big, intricately knotted scarf - will travel. The BBC and BT Sport have already clearly decided the entente is clearly cordiale in this matter as the latter's commentary teams proved more than compatible with Auntie's FA Cup output. While on the very same weekend, ITV stalwart Andy Townsend turned up at BT Sport so we could hear his thoughts on one of his former clubs, Middlesbrough. Although to be fair, in Andy's case, he is already hearing the retirement carriage clock ticking. So pick it up by the little brass handle, Andy, and get busy! BT is also where we last saw Paul Scholes doing his new thing. Which is very much in his case, since retiring from playing, talking. Scholes was employed to fill one of the zippy old sports car seats on BT's Fletch & Sav show. Robbie 'Sav' Savage being perhaps the prime example of a man who seems to have his name on a mug in both channel's kitchens. ITV's punditry team brave the cold as they stand close to the pitch at the Parc des Princes . Mark Pougatch was making his debut as ITV's host having replaced Adrian Chiles . And those of you who saw it will know that he really seemed to enjoy the experience alongside his elaborately-haired former Manchester United youth team-mate. Because he looked like he'd got to reminisce about a form of transport Robbie used to apparently favour. At least, that's what I assume was happening when Scholes laughed gently to himself in the studio, then muttered under his breath 'moped'. Yes, I've watched it back. He is DEFINITELY talking about Robbie's old two stroke engine motorbike. Come Tuesday evening, Scholes was back. And it was now his turn to turn the other channel. Paul was now over on ITV as part of their revamped football coverage. Adrian Chiles is now officially providing his face for radio. With one of the airwaves' finest, Mark Pougatch taking his place in the process. And for this return to the channel's coverage of the Champions League, one of Chiles' old sparring partners - well, you did get the feeling he'd loved to have given him a little dig - Roy Keane was also now back to share his thoughts with us. Although I would have been very surprised if, as a result, Scholes then decided he'd have a giggle at the expense of this former Red Devil's preferred mode of transport. Paul Scholes and former Manchester United team-mate Phil Neville on 'Fletch & Sav' Scholes appeared to call Savage a 'k***head' live on BT Sport's 'Fletch & Sav' Roy Keane during ITV's coverage of Chelsea's Champions League tie with Paris Saint-Germain . Instead, what we saw was a very steady piece of sport telly. No longer pitchside, but still stood al fresco amongst the crowd dressed like an am-dram production of 'On The Town' (Sinatra fans will understand), this new line-up absolutely hit the stands running. Indeed, so seamless was it, the only mild controversy was the fact that Roy described it all as 'if anything, pretty boring'. Which is fair enough. That can be how these games are sometimes. But you could certainly argue that at least what Pougatch did as a result was not choose to try and wring blood out of a stone. Taking his pundits through the procedure with no fuss or histrionics, this was very much a steady start for the new ITV line up. To the point where Jose Mourinho even played ball in the post-match interview. In fact, the only real drama we saw was David Luiz moving the referee's disappearing foam at a free-kick. The crazy mophead. Oh, perhaps THAT'S who Paul Scholes was talking about? Paul Scholes soaks up the atmosphere at the Parc des Princes before the game on Tuesday night . Branislav Ivanovic rises highest to head home the opener, giving Chelsea a precious away goal . The impressive Cavani equalised shortly after the break, heading home Blaise Matuidi's cross .","Mark Pougatch made his debut on ITV as Adrian Chiles' replacement .

"Just to confirm, for those of you who aren't totally sure, there was football before the Premier League. It may not have had the profile, the air time and the money the modern game has afforded it, but the old Division One still managed to create characters. And one of those was 75 years old in the week. From the mid-eighties until the Premiership was founded in 1992, Jimmy Greaves was football's crossover personality. As one half of Saint and Greavsie, he in fact became so famous that on a couple of occasions, when he couldn't do their ITV show, he was replaced by his own spitting image puppet. Comedian and West Ham fan Russell Brand tweeted this picture of himself and Ian Wright giving Paul Gascoigne a kiss after the trio appeared on BT Sport's Matchday Live with Fletch and Sav on Sunday . Gascoigne's fellow guests on Fletch and Sav included Rio Ferdinand (left) and Russell Brand (right) The former England superstar looked well as he took a trip down memory lane at his one-time home ground . Ian Wright (centre) and Rio Ferdinand (right) were also guests of (from left) Robbie Savage and Darren Fletcher . The year 1992 may have been the beginning of the end of Jimmy as a telly force, but it also happened to be the year that Channel 4 decided that Italian football had enough 'showbiz' about it to bring in a new audience. And with their Gazzetta show, it was an opportunity for the modern game to develop its first true TV personality. With the help of those series, Paul Gascoigne pretty much became bigger than football. Of course, from thereon in, life had occasion to get too big for Gazza. And his profile would often rise as a result, but for all the wrong reasons. But on Sunday morning, and at Greaves' old stamping ground, White Hart Lane became memory lane as BT Sport's Matchday Live With Fletch & Sav essentially became a platform for the Paul Gascoigne express. And Gazza was calling at all stations! Jimmy Greaves (here with England cricket legend Ian Botham during a 1985 charity walk) was football's crossover personality from the mid-eighties until the Premiership was founded in 1992 . Former Lazio star Gascoigne, pictured with Greaves, became one of the sport's greatest characters . Brand became very much the fans' voice in the room when he told Gazza 'the greatness is still in you' Sporting a magnificently eccentric grey paint brush of a beard, and with his hair slicked back, the first thought was that he was looking well. Then when he answered Darren Fletcher's question as to what he thought of the career we had just seen in highlight form with just one word, 'Doddle', the next thought was, this should be fun. And the great news is, it was. To begin with, he talked with real love about his present surroundings and pointed at the part of the stadium where he once tried to help ground staff get rid of some unruly birds. 'I fell through the roof, 30 foot down', he laughed. When he explained to Terry Venables how he had got injured, he told his boss 'a pigeon did it'. All eyes in the star-studded north London studio were on Gascoigne during the rare TV appearance . Gascoigne, who gave some of his best years to Spurs from 1988 to 1992, celebrates an FA Cup semi-final win . Venables was also cited as his favourite gaffer, and was also the man who made him tearful on this show as he remembered how his soon-to-be Tottenham boss told the young Gascoigne if he joined him at Spurs 'in 10 days you'll be playing for England'. We also found out his favourite player to line up alongside was Bryan Robson, who he called 'dog poo. Because he was everywhere'. Actually, he probably didn't call him quite that in real life. He likely tidied that up for the cameras. Although a little later on, when the sound was briefly muted by BT, it was clear that he was having such a good time he had rather forgotten he was back on the box. But that was a small price for BT to pay because they definitely had a Gazza in the studio chatting apparently freely, and without the weight of the world on his shoulders. Helped, I would suggest, by a captive audience in the studio alongside him. Gazza said Bryan Robson (right), who he called 'dog poo', was his favourite player to line up alongside . He went onto play under Robson at Middlesbrough where he stayed from 1998 to 2000 . At turns, Rio Ferdinand, Ian Wright and West Ham's leading turn Russell Brand - at the game as very much the committed fan - sat in awe as he recounted his tall tales. These fellas aren't too shabby themselves, which just goes to show the inherent, unadulterated appeal of the Geordie boy. The anecdotes continued to come thick and fast. He told of how he recently bumped into Colin Hendry, who he'd famously turned inside out with 'that' goal against Scotland. The centre half asked him, 'What are you doing in London? I thought you lived in Bournemouth?'. To which Gazza replied, 'What are you doing in London? I thought I left you at Wembley?' Gascoigne appeared on the  BT Sport programme before Tottenham faced West Ham at White Hart Lane . The former England maestro also recalled a funny recent meeting with former Scotland defender Colin Hendry . He also spoke of how, as a young player at Newcastle, he once rang West Ham pretending to be his own agent because he was only earning £25 a week at his hometown club. 'My mum was on £35 a week and she wasn't even playing for the Toon', he exclaimed, and brought the house down. He reminded us too of the deal he struck with Spurs to ensure he joined the North London club, and that it included a sunbed for his sister. 'Savage always has that as part of his contracts', said Russell, getting the second biggest laugh of the morning. He was also willing to confront some of those demons that had also haunted both Jimmy Greaves and Russell Brand at one point in their lives. Gazza also said Terry Venables was his favourite manager in a career that began at Newcastle United . Gascoigne became tearful on BT Sports when recalling how Venables told him that if he joined Spurs 'in 10 days you'll be playing for England' He spoke of how his fundamental aim on a football pitch was to 'entertain the fans, win them over', but that sometimes it all just became too intense for him. 'I was two-footing lampshades in the bedroom,' he said of the night before his infamous FA Cup Final appearance, so overwound was he. And he also admitted that even today 'it's sometimes hard to go to games... I end up analysing myself. I drive myself nuts. What would I have done there?' Here Brand became very much the fans' voice in the room when he turned straight to the man next to him on the settee and told him 'the greatness is still in you.' 'You mustn't feel sad,' he said. 'You've given the game so much.' There surely is no doubt that Brand spoke for all football fans when he made that heartfelt statement. And we can only hope that the Paul Gascoigne we see from this point forward is the same Gazza who had just had a great time, once again entertaining the nation from BT's couch.","Paul Gascoigne was in good form during a rare TV appearance on BT Sport's Matchday Live With Fletch & Sav on Sunday at White Hart Lane .

"I'm sure there were many millions tuning in for all the live action from London's fake East End over on the BBC. But around the same time, over on ITV, the big question was whether Liverpool's injured captain Steven Gerrard was going to die a death as an ITV pundit for his own team's Europa League tie against Besiktas. Telly has been pretty kind to ex-England skippers of recent years. But that has tended to be from the world of cricket where the likes of Michael Atherton, Michael Vaughan, Nasser Hussain and Andrew Strauss have all managed to convert themselves from awkward post-match rent-a-quote merchants into erudite masters of punditry. For the majority of his playing career, you'd struggle to argue that Gerrard has remained anything but staunchly in that first category. Clint Eastwood may have made an entire career out staring intently out of a pained squint. But with a similar expression when on camera, Steven - and, yes, of course this is a man who has very much let his excellent feet do the talking - has tended to look more like he's having a torch shone in his eyes while somewhere he shouldn't be. Steven Gerrard worked as a pundit on ITV for Liverpool's Europa League clash with Besiktas . The 34-year-old former England captain was not playing because of a hamstring injury . However, that recent interview before the Merseyside derby with Jamie Redknapp on Sky Sports shed light on a different Gerrard. Perhaps with the shackles now falling off, and certainly with a good mate to talk to, there was more than a hint that perhaps the real Stevie G will soon stand up. Mind you, live telly is a different beast, and a bigger ask. Yet he started the coverage looking relaxed, and with a big smile on his face. This I feel, was thanks to having the quality pairing of Statler and Waldorf - that's Gordon Strachan and Peter Reid - alongside him. These two old stagers know their onions, but still chatter away like they’re tucked in the corner of the snug on a Sunday lunchtime. Strachan in particular managed to lighten the mood quickly by interrupting proceedings to ask the injured midfielder if he had any idea how the grades of hamstring injuries worked, because he had none? To which Gerrard just chuckled and said: 'Haven't got a clue, either'. If it helps Gordon, I think it goes from wafer thin to honey roast. Gerrard and Peter Reid, who was also working for ITV, in the studio during the game . Gerrard watches the Europa league match from an unfamiliar vantage point . Liverpool striker Mario Balotelli struck a late penalty as the Reds beat Besiktas 1-0 in the Europa League . Gerrard then faced his first little test when responding to a short film on his team mate Daniel Sturridge. As at ease with a camera in his face as he is a ball at his feet, he explained that goal-scoring 'is natural for me'. But he also pointed out: 'I'd be surprised if I don't see (Gerrard) back here' in a management capacity. Sturridge's captain deftly avoided that potential two-footer by talking about how he was still very much a player, and that he was also aware that management 'is tough'. 'Have a look at us!', responded Gordon. A few more laughs, and that was the pre-match dealt with tidily. After what Andy Townsend then described as a 'tough 45 minutes', it was back to the pundits for their half time verdict. And although Gerrard's words said that 'for a nil-nil, it was very entertaining', it seemed that he hadn't bothered to tell his face. Which had reverted back to the rather dour demeanour it is given to adopt when out if a suit, and in a kit. But that's just a lack of experience. Not knowing to turn yourself back on. Something he managed to do when he quipped of the excellent young Jordon Ibe's first half: 'I think the contract he signed this morning has done him the world of good'. Gerrard started the evening slowly but grew into his role as a pundit . Balotelli took the ball off team-mates Jordan Henderson and fellow striker Daniel Sturridge to take the penalty . Post-match provided Gerrard with a different challenge as the winning penalty came shrouded in controversy. This I assumed would be the moment he pulled on the PR's white coat and become Doctor Spin. Not a bit of it! 'I'd have took the penalty. That's what would have happened', was the injured captain's unswerving response to Matt Smith's question. And he didn't stop there. 'Jordan [Henderson] should have taken the penalty. Mario was being mischievous. Rules are rules. Codes are codes'. This certainly got his two senior colleagues shifting in their seats. Peter Reid started to explain he couldn't see any problem with it, but Gerrard was all over him. 'What would you have said to Balotelli if he had missed?', he asked sharply. Reid replied: 'But he didn't’ and Strachan jumped in. 'Not the point' snapped the Scot, as those two then went at it. I have to admit, this was not the diplomatic package I was expecting the Liverpool player to deliver at his place of work, inside Anfield. And so that was Steven Gerrard at work in the TV booth. We got a few smiles, then some frowns, but in the end, absolutely no nonsense. In other words, EXACTLY what we expect of him when he's on the field of play.

"West Ham are drawing up a 'long list' of potential new managers to replace Sam Allardyce in the summer. The latest name on that list is former Holland and Barcelona boss Frank Rijkaard. Other names include Slaven Bilic of Besiktas, Michael Laudrup, currently managing in the Middle East, Real Sociedad’s David Moyes and Marseille boss Marcelo Bielsa. West Ham look set to replace manager Sam Allardyce this summer with fans less than happy in east London . Michael Laudrup (left) and Frank Rijkaard (right) are just two names from a long list of potential successors . The club’s official line is that they will wait until the end of the season to decide on Allardyce’s future when his contract expires. Football Grapevine revealed in the autumn that would be the case even when there were then suggestions that a new deal would be struck given how well the Hammers had started the season. But that was never going to happen. Allardyce's position was under threat at the start of the campaign. And indeed had West Ham started the season on current form - just three wins in 12 (two of those in the FA Cup, including a penalty shoot-out against Everton) ahead of Sunday's match with Tottenham - he would have been sacked. The last eight Premier League games have seen one win, four draws and three defeats. I understand the board have come to the conclusion that while overall Allardyce has done a good job in leading the club back to the Premier League and keeping it there the time has come for a new stimulus. The 4-0 defeat at the hands of West Brom in the FA Cup could be the straw that broke the camel's back . Last week’s 4-0 humiliation at WBA in their FA Cup fifth round exit will likely be seen, on reflection in the summer, as the straw that broke the camel’s back. And given that next season is the last at the Boleyn Ground I understand the club feel a new dimension is required most likely from a foreign coach to get the results AND play the sort of football that will attract new fans to fill the Olympic Stadium when they move in, in 2017. The club have looked admiringly at the impact that Ronald Koeman has made at Southampton which is why fellow Dutchman Rijkaard ,who has been out of top level coaching since leaving Saudi Arabia in 2013, could be seen as a wise choice. The situation could come to a head sooner if Sunderland part ways with Gus Poyet, who was on West Ham’s radar last summer and could yet be a candidate. Allardyce would be an obvious target for Sunderland if that job becomes vacant. But Big Sam may well seek a job abroad if as seems most likely he leaves the Hammers in the summer. Ronald Koeman (r) has impressed at Southampton and the Hammers may look at Rijkaard as a similar mould . Gus Poyet is under pressure at Sunderland and Allardyce and the Uruguayan could swap places . Theirry Henry is being groomed as a potential successor to Arsene Wenger. Earlier this month FG revealed that Henry had started taking his coaching badges which would lead to a role working at London Colney training HQ initially with younger players. Wenger confirmed that to be the last case last week. There is a belief amongst the Arsenal hierarchy that with some coaching experience under his belt including moving up to help with the first team Henry could quickly acquire the right attributes to become a top manager despite lacking experience. Former Arsenal captain Thierry Henry has taken up a coaching role and could be set for more in the future . Arsenal look as to how Pep Guardiola returned to Barcelona after his playing career ended, working as B team coach  before taking over from Rijkaard after one year. In that sense a time table that could see legendary Gunners striker Henry take over at the start of the 2017-18 season is possible. It remains to be seen though how the rest of the season unfolds. Current Ajax coach Frank de Boer, backed up by former Gunners Dennis Bergkamp and Marc Overmars remains an option should the club wish to move in another direction. Since his retirement, Henry has been working as a television pundit for Sky Sports . Edinson Cavani has been touted as a summer target for Arsenal in a £64million deal from PSG to make way for the French club signing Angel di Maria from Manchester United. However, Real Madrid are considering making a move for the Uruguayan striker and it would be major shift in policy if Arsenal paid that sort of fee and the £250,000-a-week wages Cavani would want. Edinson Cavani has been touted as a summer target for Arsenal should PSG sign Angel di Maria . Robert Lewandowski has come onto Manchester United’s radar in what promises to be another summer of big spending for Louis van Gaal. The Polish striker joined Bayern Munich from Borussia Dortmund on a free transfer last summer. Eleven goals in 28 games has not been a bad return but the word in Germany is that he hasn’t really settled in under Pep Guardiola. It seems certain United won’t exercise their option to sign Radamal Falcao on a permanent basis and Lewandowski would be in ideal addition to bolster their front line especially if he comes on the market around the £30 million bracket. Bayern Munich striker Robert Lewandowski (left) is a summer transfer target for Manchester United . I am hearing . Real Madrid will battle PSG for Tottenham’s £25m-rated goalkeeper Hugo Lloris in the summer. I am also hearing . Andy Carroll could be sold by West Ham in the summer, that is if he can prove his fitness to another club. The club’s hierarchy have grown weary of Carroll’s terrible injury record since making him their record singing at £15m 18 months ago following a season’s loan at the club from Liverpool . I hear Newcastle, who sold Carroll to Liverpool for £35m, would be willing to take him back but offer as little as £8 million plus appearance bolt ons. Carroll , sideline to the end of the season with a knee injury ,would also have to consider a wage cut. With the likelyhood that Sam Allardyce ,who has so much belief in the player ,will be gone, the club would be ready to get the erratic England centre forward off their books . Carroll injured his knee but stayed on the pitch after West Ham had made all three of their substitutions . Carroll has posted a picture of his bandaged and swollen knee on his official Instagram account . iSay . QPR’s new manager Chris Ramsey spoke impressively when questioned about the events on the Paris Metro last week. As one of the few black bosses in English football and who, as a player, started out in the early Eighties when racism was rife, Ramsey, 52, was better qualified than most to take a view on the situation. And Ramsey was candid. He went out of his way to stress that those guilty of the abuse were not real Chelsea supporters and the club itself should not be held responsible even if they had a duty to take the action of banning the fans from Stamford Bridge. What Ramsey wants to see is the authorities in France and England take the lead in rounding up the bigots. Quite right. Chris Ramsey spoke out his experiences with racism during his time in football . Ramsey stressed it was a social issue which he said has improved markedly over the course of time… with football often leading the way. But he warned racism lurks hidden and disguised, often in places where on the face of it all the right anti-racists noises are made but behind closed doors. Which is why the authorities must show the will to pursue the suspects with vigour. The depth and power of Ramsey’s words suggested he has the mental strength to succeed as a top-flight manager. He certainly has the technical credentials having earned his stripes on merit after a playing career was cut short by injury, working with the FA, England Under 20s and most recently developing talent at Tottenham. In many ways it was the emergence of black players as heroes to kids of all races, players like Laurie Cunningham, Cyrille Regis, John Barnes, Ian Wright, Patrick Vieira, that helped push racists to the edges of the football world. A new wave of black managers can only help the cause further. So I just hope things go well for Ramsey at QPR and he shows he can handle to pressures of being a top-flight boss as well as he handled last week’s press conference . And who knows if he does, then in a few years’ time Ramsey could become the England national team’s first black manager. BTW: . It was good to catch up with Trevor Sinclair on the phone last week about the reunion he had with some ex-Blackpool stars last week. The former England winger was particularly delighted to see Jimmy Armfield at the function. Jimmy is now 79 but it was great to hear Trevor report that the former England right back and skipper before Bobby Moore was in good shape. Jimmy Armfield (right) leads out the England team  as Alfredo Di Stefano leads out the Rest Of The World . Trevor Sinclair met up with some of his ex-Blackpool team-mates at a reunion . I recalled a conversation I had with Jimmy some years ago when Steven Gerrard was breaking through into the England team. Jimmy felt that England could actually get the best out of him, and Frank Lampard, by playing Gerrard as playmaker at right back or wing back. ‘Really?’, I questioned. Armfield went on to point out the brilliance of Carlos Alberto as Brazil right back and captain in 1970 and then Cafu who won two World Cups in 1994 and 2002. Armfield continued that sometimes in international football the only space to exploit is when coming deep from the flanks and that players must adapt from their club positions to impose themselves in the national side. As Sinclair said, such thinking out of the box is what is often needed to make an international team full of individual stars, winners. Sadly in England it’s not since the days of Glenn Hoddle that there has been a manger prepared to do so. iBet . Last season West Ham beat Tottenham three times, twice in the league then at White Hart Lane in the Capital One Cup. Spurs beat the Hammers on the opening day of the season and it hard not to see a Spurs win at home. Coral quote 5/6, the draw is 13/5, while a Hammers win 7/2. Ravel Morrison (left) scores during West Ham's 3-0 win against Tottenham at White Hart Lane in October 2013 . Not surprisingly Harry Kane is 7/2 to score the first goal. But Diafra Sakho at 8-1 might be worth a tickle if the Hammers start on front foot. A possible treble today then is a Spurs win, with both Everton vs Leicester and Southampton vs Liverpool to end up as draws.","West Ham boss Sam Allardyce has been criticised by fans this season .

"The world’s most extraordinary woman athlete? Those who love athletics and tennis and all the other sports in which women are achieving amazing things will have their favourites, no doubt. But if there is anyone right now who is coming close to matching the feats of the remarkable Lydia Ko, I’ll be most impressed. Indeed, the only thing that might cost her marks is that she is barely a woman at all. She is only 17, for heaven’s sake, and yet ruling the world in a sport in which a player’s prime years are usually considered to be around twice her age. Becoming world No 1 three weeks ago was astounding enough, but how she would cope was the acid test. Think of Martin Kaymer, who could not handle reaching the summit in the men’s game in his mid-20s. Or Yani Tseng, who won majors for fun for a while but admitted her relief when she was finally relieved of the mantle. Lydia Ko holds the Australian Open trophy following her victory in Melbourne on Sunday . New Zealander Ko has shot her way to the top of the world rankings at just 17 years old . Ko’s mother Tina could not hide her anxiety, tugging her hair and exclaiming: ‘Headache. She’s too young to be No 1.’ So it was that Ko, born in South Korea but a proud New Zealander, assumed the awesome responsibility at the Australian Open last week. The venue was Royal Melbourne, one of the world’s best courses and a test so devilish it would trip up any pretender. Could she live up to her billing? As ever, Ko took it all in her uniquely impressive stride. Even when she stumbled early on during the final round on Sunday she did not panic, getting back on track with a spectacular eagle three. Ko was the centre of attention in Melbourne and took time to sign autographs for keen fans . Ko is coached by David Leadbetter who is best-known for tutoring Sir Nick Faldo . Ko has won nine times as a professional with six of her victories coming on the difficult LPGA Tour . ‘That’s Lydia,’ says her coach David Leadbetter, who achieved fame tutoring Sir Nick Faldo. ‘She walks on this cloud and never gets overly excited or overly down.’ Just to remind the world of her age, Ko broke into a fit of giggles walking down the 72nd fairway before putting the finishing touches to a classy two-shot victory. It was, believe it or not, her ninth win as a professional, and six of them have been achieved on the LPGA Tour, the toughest circuit in the women’s game. This week she goes home to play in the New Zealand Open, an event she won as a 15-year-old amateur. If Ko remains true to her word, we must enjoy her performances while we can. Far from becoming burned out at 30, she plans to retire and seek a second career as a sports psychologist. Do you think she would have any trouble attracting leading sportswomen to pay top dollar to learn her secrets? QUOTE OF THE WEEK . ‘If Phil Mickelson wants to say what he said, it’s up to him. But if I had a losing record like his in the Ryder Cup, I’d just keep my mouth shut.’ Merry Mex Lee Trevino was not so merry in an interview last week when asked about the lefty’s now infamous mutiny at Gleneagles last year, when he publicly criticised captain Tom Watson in the wake of yet another defeat at the hands of Europe. Mickelson, who has played in 10 Ryder Cups and finished on the winning side just twice, currently trails Jim Furyk by one point to see who can run up the most losing matches in US Ryder Cup history. On Tuesday, the PGA of America will announce Davis Love will be the next skipper, thereby giving him the chance to atone for being on the wrong end of the sporting miracle that occurred at Medinah in 2012. Lee Trevino was unimpressed with Phil Mickelson's behaviour following the US side's loss at Gleneagles . Mickelson (centre) publicly criticised captain Tom Watson following Europe's victory in Scotland . McGinley Jnr is one in a million . Let’s see. Your brother helped Europe win the Ryder Cup on three occasions and proved, by near unanimous consent, to be the best captain Europe has ever had in masterminding victory at Gleneagles last year. How on earth do you emerge from such a particularly large golfing shadow? With a feat that has become the talk of the golf community in the United Arab Emirates, Michael McGinley somewhat managed it last week. The vast majority of club golfers would be thrilled to achieve three holes-in-one over the course of a lifetime. Michael, younger brother of Paul, achieved three in the space of six days. Captain Paul McGinley is doused in champagne following his team's Ryder Cup triumph last September . A plus-one golfer at the impressive Dubai Creek course, the UAE resident mustered the first of his aces at the difficult par-three fourth at Jumeirah Golf Estates — home to the DP World Tour Championship each November — using a four-iron. He came up with another at the fifth on his home course a couple of days later before demonstrating that good things really can come in threes by holing out once more during his next round, with a nine-iron at the eighth. ‘I had a hole-in-one when I was 15 but hadn’t had one since, so to have three in six days is an amazing, incredible feeling,’ he said. Clearly, when it comes to this sport, such feelings rather run in the family.","Lydia Ko became world No 1 three weeks ago .

"Manchester City are considering a £100million bid to buy Luis Suarez. Suarez has come to the fore for Barcelona for the first time this season since his £75m move from Liverpool last summer. The Uruguayan's two goals in Barca's 2-1 win at the Etihad Stadium would seem to have given City no way back when it comes to the Champions League last-16 second leg at the Nou Camp. Luis Suarez scored twice on his return to England this week against Manchester City at the Etihad Stadium . Suarez added a third goal for the week, and created another, against Granada on Saturday . But overall since joining Barca things have not worked out well for Suarez. Football Grapevine sources have been told that the club would like to move the striker on. City are aware of that and would pay a huge amount to take the player now that they realise that their ambition to sign Lionel Messi is unlikely to ever come to fruition. The major stumbling block to any deal this summer is that Barca remain under a transfer embargo until 2016 in the wake breaches of Financial Fair Play regulations. Before this week Suarez had not hit the heights expected at Barcelona, and the club are keen to get rid of him . Sergio Aguero could be used as a makeweight as Barca cannot make any new signings until next January . So even if the Catalans cashed in on Suarez they could not sign a replacement until the next January transfer window. It is understood however that a straight swap of Sergio Aguero and Suarez is not out of the question. Alex Song believes he will get a move to Liverpool or Manchester City this summer. But after another dire display for West Ham – this time in the 3-1 defeat against Crystal Palace - Song may find that Premier League clubs won't want to pick up his hefty wages. Song is on loan at the Hammers from Barcelona and, after an excellent start to the season, his form has dipped massively. Alex Song's form has dropped off significantly since the start of the season, but he still wants a big move . West Ham are picking up the thick end of his £140,000-a-week salary and are now less likely to make the move permanent. Liverpool may still be interested given Steven Gerrard's departure. But why would they pay that much to Song when they are in dispute with Raheem Sterling over his demands for £120,000-a-week? It is understood, however, that Sterling will sign soon given that interest from Real Madrid has over blown. Song believes he can play for a Champions League club, but his wage demands could be a sticking point . Dimitar Berbatov, who spearheaded Monaco's 3-1 win over Arsenal, wants one last hurrah in the Premier League next season. Berbatov still has a house in Chigwell, Essex. Dimitar Berbatov, who scored against Arsenal this week and has a house in Essex, wants a return to England . He would like to play for West Ham and even at 34 believes he could still do a job at that level. Crystal Palace represents another option. Crystal Palace beat West Ham 3-1, with all goals coming from set pieces. That means that Palace have now scored 18 Premier League goals this season from set pieces - by far more than any other team. Not a lot of people know that. Scott Dann scores yet another goal from a Crystal Palace set piece in the game against West Ham . Jimmy Greaves has hit back at reports that he has snubbed former club Tottenham for 45 years since he left Spurs. It was stated in an article by a newspaper that Greaves has never been back to watch a game at White Hart Lance since he moved to West Ham in 1970. But Greaves said: 'As a Sun reporter then a TV reporter I went there loads of times. Really loads. I launched my autobiography there and I attended the funerals of both Bill Nicholson and Bobby Smith. 'But I don't go to games. I never have. It's not just Spurs. I don't go to any of my other clubs either.' And Greaves, who turned 75 last week, insists he did not turn down an invitation from Tottenham to be a guest of honour at Wembley for the Capital One Cup final against Chelsea - the club where he started his career. 'There was no invitation forthcoming but I wouldn't have gone if they did,' he said. 'I've got a lovely giant screen TV, a lovely dog and a warm fire. That's where I watch sport and it's very nice. I'm not interested in driving in heavy traffic and enduring big crowds and being freezing cold. I love it on TV.' And no doubt if the Spurs-Chelsea game gets a bit dull for Greaves he will flick channels to watch the Six Nations crunch clash between England and Ireland. During a speech he made at a dinner recently Greaves made it clear he tires of the antics of footballers and has grown to prefer rugby union. Daniel Alves will choose between Manchester United and Juventus when his contract at Barcelona expires this summer. Howard Webb retired at the end of last season . West Ham boss Sam Allardyce has backed a call for Howard Webb to return to refereeing. Webb hung up his whistle last summer after officiating at the World Cup. He has taken up a role at the Professional Game Match Officials Ltd but former ref chief Keith Hackett believes Webb is wasted. 'Most agree Howard was our top referee and had been for many seasons. There has been a dip in standards this season and one of the reasons is because Howard is not around and one or two refs have been moved up to the big games and they are not good enough,' said Hackett. 'Howard is only 43. There is no doubt he has several more seasons in him.' Allardyce agreed: 'Howard should come back out of his retirement. He was a referee who has the ability to manage to games and has been missed this season.' I am hearing . Manchester City are still keen on luring Paul Pogba from Juventus. The former Manchester United youth product is valued in the region of £60 million. City could offer Yaya Toure as part of the deal, although Paris Saint-Germain would enter the market should the Ivorian become available. Manchester City are interested in Juventus' former Manchester United midfielder Paul Pogba . I am also hearing . Sam Allardyce has recommended that James Tomkins can help solve England's problems at centre half and has also told England boss Roy Hodgson he should pick Mark Noble to add energy to his midfield. I say : . It was interesting to attend an event of You are The Ref, a website run by former referee Keith Hackett in the week. Another ex-ref Mark Halsey was on the panel alongside West Ham boss Sam Allardyce at Riley's Sports bar in London's Haymarket. Many issues were discussed to an impressively attentive audience. Most interesting was Hackett's proposal to get rid of yellow cards, introduce a sin bin and reserve sending offs for only the most serious offences. Hackett has already raised the matter with the LMA who agree and want the FA to go ahead with a trial run in the conference. 'One of the big problems in the game right now is that we have a confetti card culture,' said Hackett. Keith Hackett is keen to get rid of red cards for two bookings, like the one given to Glenn Murray on Sunday . 'Refs are under directions to issue cards for all sorts of technical offences. Too often we see games ruined because a team has seen a player sent off for two 'soft' yellows. It also promotes a climate of confrontation. 'What we need is for refs to be allowed to manage games. If a player has made a bad foul the ref should warn him and if he transgresses then he goes into the sin bin.' Allardyce backed the proposal: 'I like Keith's idea of getting rid of yellow cards and examining how a sin bin for say 10-15 minutes would work for a player who has totted up what would amount two yellows. 'It has an immediate impact but for a period of time without affecting the whole match. We have seen it work in rugby so why not give it a go?' BTW . It was good to be in the company of many former Spurs stars during the week at Planet Hollywood for the launch the new football social media site Hinch.as – listening to Ossie Ardiles and Garth Crooks in a heated debate about politics and religion was absorbing. But it wasn't about all our yesterdays. Indeed it was a pleasure to meet Newcastle Jonas Gutierrez who revealed that he was ready to return to Premier League action having undergone surgery to remove his left testicle due to cancer last September. Indeed, the 31-year-old Argentine winger was in the Toon squad for Saturday's win against Aston Villa. He was engaging company and an inspiration to listen to. It is to be hoped he revives his career. Testicular cancer affect men between the ages of 15 and 49. It accounts for 1 per cent of cancers that occur in men. More than 96 per cent treated early will be cured . I Bet : . Tottenham have a habit of seeing a season blow up in their face within a week. While it was a great comeback to draw against West Ham, failure to win hit their top four hopes; then they were dumped out of the Europa League by Fiorentina. And Chelsea are hot favourites to win the Capital One Cup, Coral quoting 4-7. Harry Kane is a good shout as top goalscorer in the Capital One Cup final, but Chelsea are hot favourites . The draw at 90 minutes is 16-5. Optimistic Spurs fans will surely be tempted by 5-1 on them winning. First goalscorer? Harry Kane in 7-1. And for a value punt Branislav Ivanovic is 20-1.","Luis Suarez scored twice against Manchester City in Champions League .

"It’s quite understandable that the European Tour and other parties with a vested interest should promote Darren Clarke versus Miguel Angel Jimenez for the Ryder Cup captaincy as some kind of heavyweight clash of equals. But there’s no reason the rest of us need fall for it. Quite frankly, when the newly-formed five-man committee meet on Wednesday to decide this important matter, they either give the nod to Clarke or they make themselves look ridiculous. Darren Clarke and Miguel Angel Jimenez are battling it out to be European captain . Yes, the Spaniard is a wonderful character and it is amazing he’s still competitive on tour at 51. But the idea he could leapfrog Clarke for a post considered the pinnacle of a player’s career should offend anyone who has followed closely the fortunes of the European game these past 20 years. Haven’t we had too many captains born in the UK and isn’t this a chance to recognise the enormous contribution made by mainland Europe? Well, it’s an argument. But forgive me if I stick to the idea that the best candidate should get the nod, regardless of where they were born, and Clarke is plainly the best. The most important consideration has to be the views of the players who are likely to make up the next team. By my calculations, eight who were at Gleneagles last time have said it should go to Clarke, with four undeclared. Are the committee really going to go against the wishes of such men as Rory McIlroy, Justin Rose, Ian Poulter and Graeme McDowell? Public relations has become a massive part of the job and it is hard to see how Jimenez would cope, on several levels. It would be wrong if his fractured English precluded him, but a long-held disinclination to do interviews that don’t suit him ought to be taken into account. Clarke is no angel in this regard, either. He’s had his mad moments; indeed there have been plenty of things he’d probably do differently if he had the chance. Rory McIlroy wants fellow Northern Irishman Clarke to be European captain for 2016 Ryder Cup defence . But he’s bursting with pride merely at the thought of getting this job, and would cope far better with all the unspoken demands. In terms of playing records, there is no comparison. Clarke has won an Open and two World Golf Championship events, achievements that Jimenez cannot get near. That might not matter anymore, given Paul McGinley’s stellar captaincy last time. Like Jimenez, he had not won a major or any of the WGCs. Paul McGinley pushed all the right buttons as Europe sailed to victory over the USA in 2014 . But Ryder Cup records have to be part of the equation — and here there is no comparison, either. Jimenez’s record is poor, with 5.5 points gained from 15 matches for a win percentage of just 37 per cent. Clarke’s win percentage is 58 per cent from 20 matches played. There are few men who can better that percentage in the long history of the contest but two of them will decide his fate tomorrow morning — Colin Montgomerie, captain in 2010, and Jose Maria Olazabal, who was skipper in 2012. Alongside McGinley, David Howell (representing the tournament players’ committee) and outgoing chief executive George O’Grady, they will surely pick the man whose outstanding contribution to European golf deserves the ultimate accolade. It has to be Clarke. Dustin Johnson to give Rory McIlroy a run for his money at the Masters . We’ve reached that period in the season when all eyes turn to America and we’re looking for runners and riders who might upset the favourite Rory McIlroy when the Masters comes around in April. We’ve seen Tiger Woods fall at the first fence. We’ve seen Phil Mickelson pull up lame. And, on the unrivalled Monterey Peninsula in California last week, we saw three gifted performers lengthen their stride to illustrate their legitimate claims. American Dustin Johnson impressed on his return from six-month leave of absence . There was Australian Jason Day, now blessedly injury-free and following up his win the previous week with a top-seven finish; America’s best young golfer Jordan Spieth, who went so close on his Masters debut last time, putting together four rounds in the sixties to demonstrate fame and fortune will not distract him. And finally there was Dustin Johnson, back from his six-month leave of absence with rounds of 69, 67, 68, 66 and vowing to put his party lifestyle behind him. Rory McIlroy aims to build on his two major wins in 2014 and complete a career grand slam at April's Masters . Like McIlroy and Bubba Watson, the huge-hitting Johnson should look upon Augusta as a venue where he has been bequeathed an enormous advantage. You might want to get a cheeky pound or two on him now, because my guess is his price will fall dramatically over the next seven weeks. He looks a man hell-bent on redemption.","Five-man committee will name European captain for 2016 Ryder Cup .

"Arsenal have agreed a deal in principle to sign Villarreal's Brazilian defender Gabriel Paulista in a £15million transfer. With the 24-year-old expected to join the club imminently it is likely to mean the saga surrounding Mats Hummels could see the German international move to Old Trafford rather than the Emirates. As reported by Sportsmail, Paulista was withdrawn from his Spanish club’s La Liga match this weekend increasing speculation that the centre-back was closing in on a move to the Emirates. Arsenal are edging closer to a deal for combative Brazilian centre back Gabriel Paulista (front left) Paulista is strong in the air and will strengthen a leaky defence which has shipped 25 Premier League goals . It shows that although Arsenal have strongly been linked with 26-year-old German international Hummels, his £25m-plus fee is regarded as too much by Arsene Wenger. Hummels seemingly keeps changing his mind about leaving Borussia Dortmund. Having suggested he would move on at the start of the window he has now hinted he might stay. But if Manchester United boss Louis van Gaal is adamant he wants to play a 3-5-2 system then he needs an experienced centre back who knows how to play in the formation. Hummels would seem the best available, although Van Gaal could yet move for Aston Villa’s Ron Vlaar even though he is currently injured. At £25m, Mats Hummels is thought to be outside Arsenal's price range, but he may interest Manchester United . Ron Vlaar, who worked with Van Gaal at the World Cup, could also be a target for the Red Devils . Crystal Palace are considering a move for Dimitar Berbatov. The 33-year-old forward is understood to be unhappy in Monaco despite a reputed £4m-a-year salary. The former Spurs, Manchester United and Fulham player wants a move back to the Premier League because he’s not getting game time he wants. Dimitar Berbatov is said to be unhappy at Monaco, who face Arsenal in the Champions League next month . The mercurial Bulgarian is handsomely paid in the principality but is wanted by a raft of Premier League clubs . Palace boss Alan Pardew is looking for a No 10 type forward who can offer a different dimension to the raw pace Palace have front. Aston Villa, Leicester, Stoke and Hull may also consider a loan deal for the Bulgarian. But the word coming from Monaco was that the French club want to keep Berbatov in their squad given their Champions League involvement. West Ham will use their status on the edge of European football's elite to persuade Darren Fletcher to join them rather than West Brom. Last week figures were released naming the club’s with the biggest turnovers. Real Madrid were followed by Manchester United, with eight Premier League clubs (United, Manchester City, Chelsea, Arsenal, Liverpool, Tottenham, Newcastle and Everton) in the top 20. Darren Fletcher (left) looks set to leave Old Trafford after 342 appearances for the club . West Ham were ranked 21st and their move to the Olympic stadium in 2016 could move them into the top tier. It is an argument the club are also using to persuade Winston Reid to sign a new deal. Liverpool expect Raheem Sterling to sign a new contract this week. The deal will be in the region of £90,000-a-week. Raheem Sterling is set to put pen to paper on a new Liverpool deal which will stave off the likes of Real Madrid . It has been assumed that if QPR sacked Harry Redknapp then Glenn Hoddle would step into his shoes. But former Spurs boss Tim Sherwood would be a strong contender given his close bond with Les Ferdinand, who is now football advisor to Loftus Road owner Tony Fernandes. 'Sir' Les Ferdinand (left) was Tim Sherwood's No 2 at Spurs and the pair were former team-mates at the Lane . Craig Moore, who is currently part of the Australian backroom staff at the Asian Cup, wants to return to the UK and find a job in management. The 39-year-old former Rangers captain and Crystal Palace and Newcastle centre-half is also on the lookout for any outstanding players at the tournament in his role as an ambassador for Network 90, the new global football networking community, which amongst other things offers a job board for players and other sectors of the football business around the world. Craig Moore, pictured during his Newcastle pomp in 2007, is looking to return to the UK in management . iSay . Arsenal fans, never shy to rant on social media, were up in arms last week after Jamie Carragher castigated Gunners players for their over the top celebrations after winning at Manchester City last Sunday, then sneered at some of them posting selfies as the celebrations went on in the dressing room. I make Carragher right. And let’s be clear. He wasn’t only picking on Arsenal players. He just used the situation at the Ethiad to highlight what has become a growing and vulgar trend of uber-celebration at the end of many Premier League games. As he pointed out Arsenal's 2-0 win was impressive but was not exactly David going up against Goliath knocking them out of the Cup. In contrast look how Middlesbrough players conducted their celebrations after their FA Cup 2-0 win at City. They were obviously elated but did not (on the pitch at least) make muppets of themselves. Aaron Ramsey shared this image on social media after Arsenal beat Manchester City 2-0 at the Etihad . The Gunners players hail the travelling support after an impressive result at the Etihad . Wilfried Zaha has yet to put his foot on the gas since returning to Crystal Palace from Manchester United on loan this season. But he knows about the fast lane when it comes cars. Parked in the driveway of his Surrey commuter belt mansion, which he shares with family members, are three motors right out of Top Gear. Front of the grid is a white Lamborghini, followed by a Porsche Cayenne and a top of the range Mercedes. But new Palace boss Alan Pardew has told Zaha he must prove that as a player he is top marque like those cars. It was not an act of giant killing. Nor was it a result that delivered silverware. It was a case of a team that should be in the title running beating another rival away. A job well done by the Gunners in the middle of a league campaign. It was three points. Yes. Possibly a pivotal three points. But with half the season still to go it defined nothing apart from that despite their extra wealth Manchester City are a long way from being Real Madrid. And Arsenal when they are in the right mood are a top team. Given they are eight in European football’s rich list, compared to City’s sixth they are hardly poor relations either. Yes, they were entitled to feel well satisfied; exhilarated even, but the almost hysterical out pouring of emotion was a joke. As Carragher said, save the high fives and hugs, the photos and the video shoots for a day when a trophy is lifted. And he will say the same about his former team Liverpool and other teams who more and more indulge in celebrating every win as if they have won the World Cup. What is becoming a Self Adulation Society in top level football is embarrassing. Middlesbrough players handled their dramatic FA Cup win at Manchester City with dignity . Liverpool celebrate wrapping up the First Division title at Stamford Bridge in 1986 . BTW . A teeth whitening dentist now makes regular visits to Chelsea’s Cobham training ground. I sense the magic of the FA Cup is coming back and actually the fact that so many matches are screened live over the course of the weekend is helping not hindering. Witness the wild results in the fourth round thus far at Stamford Bridge, the Etihad, St Mary's and White Hart Lane. And wasn’t it great to see humble Cambridge United hold Manchester United to a goalless draw on Friday? And in the third round West Ham and Everton played out a different sort of drama when they went toe-to-toe in their replay with the Hammers winning 9-8 on penalties. Cambridge fans celebrate their magnificent display against United to earn a money-spinning FA Cup replay . Adrian threw his gloves off in the run-up and coolly slotted home to seal West Ham's place in the fourth round . It was made all the more memorable by the fact that the winning penalty was scored by West Ham keeper Adrian after his counterpart Joel Robles had missed. Keepers taking penalties is not that unusual but going head to for the decisive kick did seem rather unique and certainly added a splash of colour to the competition. And by the way the first time a keeper took a penalty in a shoot out in a meaningful match in English football was back in the 1974 Charity Shield when Leeds ran out of players and keeper David Harvey stepped to take one against Liverpool’s Ray Clemence and fired it high and wide. The pair then embraced and Harvey suggested it was now Clem's turn. But the former England keeper declined and so up stepped veteran Ian Callaghan to smash home the winner. iBet . Under the impressive Eddie Howe Bournemouth have been flying in the Championship and could well get promotion to the Premier League. What an achievement that would be. So it would be no surprise if the Cherries win at struggling Aston Villa. But I see Arsenal winning at Brighton and West Ham at Bristol. On Monday Rochdale in the play off places of League One can give Stoke a fright. So iBet Bournemouth Arsenal and West Ham win. Rochdale and Stoke draw.","Arsenal have agreed a deal in principle to sign Villarreal's Gabriel Paulista .

"This past weekend was a typical one for Europe’s best golf coach Pete Cowen and his Rotherham-based academy. On Friday, a party of 20 disabled kids visited, including a gifted autistic player who has a decent chance of representing Team GB in the next Paralympics. On Saturday, more than 100 kids took their first steps towards taking up the game, hitting balls on the range. And then, on Sunday, a gang of thugs broke in through the roof and basically, in Cowen’s words, ‘trashed the place’. It was the sixth such burglary in six months. And it’s left Cowen wondering what on earth is the point of carrying on. Pete Cowen looks relaxed on the driving range during the Abu Dhabi HSBC Golf Championship in January . Rory McIlroy chats with golf instructor Cowen (right) during a practice round at the US Open in June 2013 . For some time Cowen has been badgering his local council to do something about a derelict car park at the bottom of the academy that would help secure the premises but, as the whole country has learned recently to its horror, unfit for purpose happens to be this council’s specialist subject. Still, they’re not alone. Cowen can’t get help from anybody. Imagine in tennis if they had someone with his track record? Imagine an academy that produced players as good as Danny Willett, who currently leads the Race to Dubai, and Matt Fitzpatrick, the only Englishman in the last 100 years to win the US Amateur Championship? Danny Willett tees off during the first round Omega Dubai Desert Classic in Dubai in January . Picture a British tennis coach so good he pulled off the equivalent of tutoring the top three the last time The Open was staged at St Andrews. This is a man whose teaching skills are so respected 11 of the 12 players who contributed to Europe’s Ryder Cup victory at Gleneagles last year were coached or asked for his help at some point. The untold largesse the Lawn Tennis Association would lavish in his direction. In golf? ‘I’ve been in touch with the various bodies but when you ask for help it falls on deaf ears, unfortunately,’ says Cowen. ‘I’m not looking for any massive handouts. I don’t think you produce great sportsmen and women that way. But we do need a helping hand. ‘My fear is golf is dying at grassroots level. If places like mine are forced to close, what hope is there?’ Young talents such as Matt Fitzpatrick (above) have come through Cowen's academy . Cowen wrote to the minister for sport, Helen Grant, and local government minister, Eric Pickles, without reply. But he was cheered slightly by a response from the Prime Minister’s office. ‘The letter said David Cameron shares my concern, which is a start, perhaps,’ said the Yorkshireman. If truth be told, everyone should share his concern. The Pete Cowen Golf Academy might just be the most successful sports academy in Britain. It is located in a part of the country that desperately needs some help. And it might close? Is there not somebody of influence in golf or politics who can’t see the blindingly obvious here, and why this simply must not be allowed to happen? R&A MUST EXPLAIN OPEN CALL . Rarely  in 30 years writing about golf can I recall an announcement provoking the depth of anger that has followed the Royal and Ancient Golf Club’s decision to take live coverage of The Open away from the BBC. Indeed, you’d probably have more luck finding business CEOs who support Ed Miliband than golfers who think our leaders have got this one right. I’ve had emails from readers asking me to organise petitions, even a boycott of this year’s Open at St Andrews. At my local club on Saturday, the verdict was unanimous. ‘Even my friends who are R&A members think it’s a dreadful decision,’ said one influential member, who really would know plenty of R&A types. R&A chief executive Peter Dawson (above) is under-fire for the decision to take The Open away from the BBC . Meanwhile, it was announced last week that when the US Open is held on the West Coast this year, those living on the East Coast will be able to watch live, prime-time coverage on free-to-air television of all four days for the first time. Now that’s what you call a favourable television deal. A good time, therefore, to be heading to the R&A’s headquarters at St Andrews on Tuesdday to meet under-fire chief executive Peter Dawson to hear his side. Stay tuned, as they say. Jack Nicklaus has paid tribute to Billy Casper (above) who passed away on Sunday . QUOTE OF THE WEEK . ‘Billy Casper was one of the greatest family men I have had the fortunate blessing to meet. He had such wonderful balance to his life and there was always much more to him than golf. But as a golfer, he was a fantastic player, and never got enough credit for being one. When I looked up at a leaderboard, I wasn’t just looking for Palmer or Player or Trevino. I was also looking for Billy Casper.’ Jack Nicklaus pays tribute to the great American golfer, who passed away on Sunday. Casper was married to Shirley for 62 years, and they raised 11 children and 71 grandchildren and great grandchildren. In the era of the Big Three, he won three majors and 51 times on the PGA Tour to be ranked seventh on the all-time list.","Pete Cowen's Rotherham-based academy was broken into at the weekend .

"The worlds of golf and motor racing will meet in the United Arab Emirates next week for the season’s finale of the European Tour and Formula One respectively. But while one sport frets about how a distorted points distribution in the final grand prix might affect the overall outcome, the other is left to reflect on how the lack of such contrivance means its race is already effectively run. Rory McIlroy could claim title without swinging a club after sensational year . It’s an interesting one, isn’t it? Do you go the route of F1 and the PGA Tour with its FedEx Cup to ensure it all comes down to the final event? Or the European Tour route, which risks the final tournament, as it will be this year, becoming a 72-hole coronation? Certainly you can understand the angst that will be on show amid the racing fraternity in Abu Dhabi. It does seem wrong that the most important prize in the sport might be decided by a gimmick. But the Dubai World Championship? Couldn’t we have done with a gimmick to ensure the Race to Dubai is still a race when everyone gets there? Second-placed Jamie Donaldson must win last two tournaments to have any chance of claiming bonus . At the moment you’ve got the season concluding with four strong tournaments known as the Final Series. To be fair, the points totals for each event have been tweaked to try to ensure a big finish but the fact is nothing that happened in the first two events in China has made a blind bit of difference. Rory McIlroy began with a lead of just over three million points and, despite playing in neither, ends them with an advantage of just under three million. What’s the point of linking four tournaments together if so little change takes place? Where’s the incentive to make sure everyone turns up when the leader can miss the first three events and still be miles in front going into the last one? Lewis Hamilton’s dramatic duel in Formula One with Nico Rosberg will go to the final race . This week’s Turkish Airlines Open is a good event in its own right but it ought to be a pivotal tournament in terms of building the excitement towards Dubai. Yet even if second-placed Jamie Donaldson were to win it, there would still be no pressure on McIlroy for top spot. Maybe this is how it should be, given the truly spectacular year the Northern Irishman has enjoyed. But, in that case, why go along with the pretence of a Final Series? If you’re keen for a four-tournament grand finale, surely the format has to reflect the fact? Who’s got it right between F1 and the European Tour? Right now, it is tempting to think... neither. Matteo mirrors past mistakes . Over the past five years, gifted Italian Matteo Manassero has rewritten the record books when it comes to being the youngest to reach a landmark. Among the highlights are: youngest player to win the British Amateur; youngest to win the silver medal at The Open; youngest to win on the European Tour; youngest player to make the halfway cut at the Masters, and youngest to win the tour’s flagship event. Now, however, comes one he could have done without: youngest player to suffer such a precipitous decline. What on earth has happened to him? 18 months ago he was on the cusp of the world’s top 20. Now he’s outside the top 120 and never came close to making Europe’s Ryder Cup team. Matteo Manassero finished 76th out of 78 In his last outing in Shanghai at the BMW Masters . Following an encouraging 19th place at The Open he has played in seven events with four missed halfway cuts and a best finish of tied 47th for the princely earnings, from the middle of July, of £23,000. In his last outing in Shanghai at the BMW Masters he concluded with a final round of 80 to finish 76th in a field of 78. ‘After playing in the majors and seeing the length of the courses, Matteo has been working on his swing to hit the ball further but unfortunately at the moment it has taken its toll on his results,’ explained his manager, Gorka Guillen. Manassero is not one of the power players and probably does need to find some length. And at just 21, he’s the right age to try. But let’s hope he does not end up as yet another lost soul who is so bewitched by the big hitters that he loses sight of his own strengths. Quote of the week . ‘The Tour is in a very strong position now and that is why I have the confidence to move aside.’ After 40 years with the European Tour, chief executive George O’Grady announced last week he is standing down. The 65-year-old is certainly quitting at the top, following the most successful playing season in the tour’s history, with three of the four majors in European hands plus the Ryder Cup. It is also one where the top 25 in the Race to Dubai will all make in excess of £1million, and the top 10 more than £2m.","Rory McIlroy has commanding lead in the Race to Dubai .

"Was this the finest season in the history of European golf? When you think of names like Ballesteros, Faldo, Woosnam, Lyle and Langer, it would be quite a statement. Not to mention recent examples, such as 2012 when Rory was winning the US PGA and we had the miracle of Medinah. But, by way of a farewell column for this marvellous year, let’s make the case. In the spirit of Christmas, let’s recall 12 days that add to a wondrous argument for thinking it just so. Day One: Players Championship, Sawgrass . It was all a bit quiet until mid-May. Thankfully, German Martin Kaymer thought it too quiet. With a gutsy 30ft putt for par on the island-green 17th he secured a one-stroke win in the PGA Tour’s flagship event and ignited a stunning run of success. Day Two: BMW PGA Championship, Wentworth . The week began with Rory McIlroy revealing his split from fiancee Caroline Wozniacki. Gee, we thought: what next? Thankfully, the answer was Rory The Golfer Like No Other. Seven shots back with a round left, McIlroy made up the deficit with a 66 for his first win on European soil. Martin Kaymer holds the trophy after winning The Players Championship at Sawgrass . Day Three: US Open, Pinehurst . The best 72-hole performance in 2014? There’s no argument. It’s that man Kaymer. After two rounds, he was the first man in major history to follow one 65 with another. He was eight clear. No one got near him over the weekend, either. Day Four: French Open, Paris National . If you had to compile a list of players you would least like chasing you down the stretch, Graeme McDowell would be near the top. Kevin Stadler must have thought eight shots was enough insurance but G-Mac chased him down to complete a thrilling title defence. Martin Kaymer celebrates winning the US Open with fellow German Sandra Gal at Pinehurst . Day Five: Scottish Open, Royal Aberdeen . He had already won once in July, in America. Now Justin Rose crossed the Atlantic and delivered a links masterclass. Four rounds in the sixties and a total of 16 under par on a course as forbidding as this one was a majestic effort. Day Six: Open Championship, Royal Liverpool . So much for McIlroy not being able to play links golf. Like all the greats, he went away and worked hard on what was missing. His reward was two 66s to begin, a couple of eagles at the tail end of his next round, and a two-shot win on the final day. He became the first European to win three of the four majors. Rory McIlroy announced his split from fiancee Caroline Wozniacki (right) in May this year . Day Seven: Bridgestone Invitational, Firestone . Who would have blamed him if he had rested on his laurels after his Open win? McIlroy, however, was a man on a mission. Next stop, one of his favourite courses, as he caught Sergio Garcia to claim his first World Golf Championship event. He was world No 1 once more. Day Eight: USPGA Championship, Valhalla . Over the previous eight rounds we had seen the power and glory of Rory; now we saw the guts. After a long weather suspension he was three behind Rickie Fowler and Henrik Stenson and two off Phil Mickelson with nine to go. Yet he passed them all in the dying Kentucky light to seal his second Major in a row. McIlroy won the BMW PGA Championship at Wentworth just days after splitting with Wozniacki . Day Nine: Ryder Cup Friday, Gleneagles . It’s never easy being heavy favourites, nor shifting momentum after losing the opening series. But Europe’s golfers overcame both to turn a one-point deficit at lunch into a two-point advantage. The Americans had targeted McIlroy and Ian Poulter, only for Rose and Stenson to demonstrate this was a team of many talents. Day 10: Ryder Cup Saturday . The Americans came back strong on the second morning, only to run into Lee Westwood and McDowell at their most obdurate. Alongside brilliant rookie partners Jamie Donaldson and Victor Dubuisson, they ensured there would be no US comeback. Europe led by four. Ian Poulter helped Europe secure a memorable victory over United States in Ryder Cup . Day 11: Ryder Cup Sunday . A good start by the Americans and suddenly there were some frayed nerves. But G-Mac settled those by fighting back from three down against Jordan Spieth to win the opening singles. With Rory thrashing Fowler, it was Donaldson who clinched the winning point with a wedge shot of a lifetime to 12 inches. Day 12: DP World Tour Championship, Dubai . It was fitting the final event came down to a shootout between four of Europe’s stars. Appropriate too, that the shot that separated Stenson from McIlroy, Rose and Dubuisson, to the par-three 17th, was one of the best played all year. Rory McIlroy holds the Claret Jug after his two-stroke victory  at Royal Liverpool in July . Quote of the year . 'You could argue that Rory’s run in the summer was the best three-week stretch of golf ever played.' American Rickie Fowler offers his take on Rory McIlroy’s 12 rounds from mid-July to mid-August that earned him two majors and a WGC. In sequence: 66, 66, 68, 71, 69, 64, 66, 66, 66, 67, 67, 68. It wasn’t just on the men’s circuit that Europe’s leading players dominated. Thanks to Colin Montgomerie with his two senior majors and a brilliant year for the ageless Bernhard Langer, they cleaned up among the over-50s as well. Meanwhile, at the Dubai Ladies Championship this week, England’s Charley Hull, at the age of just 18, is in pole position to become the youngest winner of the Ladies European Tour Order of Merit.","German Martin Kaymer ignited stunning run of success at Sawgrass .

"We’ve got Rory McIlroy hosting the Irish Open next year and Paul Lawrie launching his own Saltire Energy Match Play tournament in his hometown of Aberdeen in July. Thomas Bjorn is the man behind an event in Denmark. Now, I can reveal, the leading English players are ready to play their part as well. Beginning in October next year, the British Masters will be held for the first time since 2008, with Ian Poulter, Luke Donald, Lee Westwood and Justin Rose taking it in turns to play the role of host. The rotation will begin with Poulter welcoming the great and good to the course in England with which he has long been associated — Woburn. Luke Donald (left) and Ian Poulter (right) will both take it in turns to host the British Masters . Lee Westwood (left) and Justin Rose (right) will also be handed the opportunity of hosting the British Masters . ‘I can’t wait,’ Poulter told Sportsmail. ‘It has been far too long since Woburn hosted a tour event. ‘When you think of the history there, with wins for the likes of Seve (Ballesteros), (Nick) Faldo and Woosie (Ian Woosnam), it deserves to have a European Tour event again. ‘It has been in fantastic condition for the last few years. It will be a great week and obviously a very proud one for me.’ Donald was equally enthusiastic. ‘We’ve been going on about England having another event for long enough and it’s great that it looks like it is finally going to happen,’ he said. ‘Let’s hope we can find the right date in the calendar. We’ve all seen how the BMW PGA Championship at Wentworth has grown over the years. It’s now one of the best events we play and I’m sure the fans would flock to a good tournament in October. It seems like a perfect fit.’ ‘What an incredible 2014. Congrats. I see Green in Spring of 2015.’ Australian Greg Norman salutes Rory McIlroy on the eve of the Northern Irishman’s final appearance of his amazing season — the defence of his Aussie Open title in Sydney this week. He also predicts that Rory will complete the career Grand Slam at the Masters next April at the age of just 25. Is there a particular course where Donald would like to play host? ‘I think I’ll have to get back to the UK and play a few of the courses like Walton Heath and Woburn and see which one would suit me,’ said the Chicago-based 36-year-old, smiling. The British Masters didn’t feature on the 2015 European Tour schedule which was released on Sunday, but tour officials are confident it will take place in the currently vacant week of October 8-11. ‘There’s a couple of Is and Ts to dot and cross but we don’t foresee any problems,’ said a tour official. ‘I’m sure it will happen.’ The event would follow the Alfred Dunhill Links and take place a fortnight before the start of the four-event Final Series in China. The British Masters was last played at Woburn in 2002, when Rose prevailed following a thrilling duel against Poulter. In the years since, Rose has become a major champion, Poulter a Ryder Cup legend and Westwood and Donald have reached No 1 in the world. Now comes the revival of an iconic tournament, and a fitting way to recognise their achievements. Who is Tiger Woods' mysterious new coach? From America to Australia to the Middle East, the same question on various tours around the world was being asked on Saturday night: who the heck is Chris Como? Such was the clamour to find out something about Tiger Woods’ new mystery swing coach, Como’s website crashed only minutes after the news was released and his Twitter account gained several thousand more followers overnight. Turns out Como is a 37-year-old Texan who has worked with the likes of South African Trevor Immelman and Australian Aaron Baddeley and has a healthy interest in golfing biomechanics — in other words, helping players swing the club in a manner that avoids injury. Tiger Woods last played at the US PGA Championship and has appointed Chris Como as a new swing coach . Given Tiger’s problems, if the new man comes up with something that keeps Woods  fit and playing for the next decade he’ll become as famous as Perry Como. Woods was introduced to the fourth swing coach of his 20-year career by his long-time friend from his university days, Notah Begay, whose own career was curtailed by a back injury. ‘Subsequently, Chris and I had several good conversations about the golf swing,’ said Woods. ‘I’ve worked with him for about a month since I started practising again, and Chris will consult and work with me during the year.’ The first fruits of their collaboration will be seen when Woods returns to the game in the tournament he hosts, the Hero World Challenge, in Florida next week. With this news following his criticism of a much commented-upon article in Golf Digest, which he called a ‘grudge-fuelled piece of character assassination’, Woods is certainly doing his bit to drum up publicity.","The British Masters will be held for  first time since 2008 in October 2015 .

While Rosberg made his first reaction to his title rival’s claims, the Mercedes management were busily applying sticking plaster to their battered team and their conficting stories in an attempt —probably successful —– to avoid punishment for the incident. Rosberg and Mercedes were all responding to the most explosive moment of the 2014 Formula One world championship. It took place over two floors of the Mercedes motorhome — the glistening, portable team hospitality area — in the Spa paddock an hour-and-a-half after the race.

Winging it: A piece of Hamilton's wing soars over German Rosberg's Mercedes after the high-speed collision .

Simultaneously, on the first floor, Lewis Hamilton was... briefing the press. Rosberg, unsmiling but composed, described their second lap crash as a ‘racing incident’, while Hamilton, careworn and emotional, revealed Rosberg told him in a meeting minutes before that he had deliberately caused the accident which ended the British driver’s race. Rosberg finished second to extend his championship lead over Hamilton to 29 points. Responding to Hamilton’s claims in what he described as one of ‘the more difficult’ of his regular video blogs released late on Monday afternoon, Rosberg said: ‘I have been told what Lewis said in the press and the way he has stated his version of events. ‘My view of events is very different. But it is better that I don’t now give all the details of my opinion. I hope you respect that. I prefer to keep it internal.’ Booed: Rosberg was jeered when he took to the podium to claim his second-place prize in Belgium .

A Mercedes spokesman said their drivers will take part in a sponsor event in Stuttgart on Wednesday as planned. They are expected to see each other briefly. But back to Spa on Sunday night. Moments after Hamilton made his claim, a Mercedes insider confirmed his recall of Rosberg’s admission as ‘broadly correct’. However, in an attempt to defuse the situation before the governing FIA might have become involved, Mercedes changed tack. Their new, refined position was outlined in private briefings and summed up in the on-the-record words of Toto Wolff, the de facto team principal, who said: ‘They agreed to disagree in a very heated discussion, but it wasn’t deliberately crashing. That is nonsense. ‘Nico felt he needed to hold his line. He needed to make a point. He thought it was for Lewis to leave him space and that Lewis didn’t leave him space. Ripped: Hamilton limps into the pits with a torn-up rear-left tyre after the incident on Sunday in Belgium . Change: Rosberg didn't escape damage and had to have his right front-wing endplate replaced in the pits . It was deliberately taking into account that if Lewis moved it could end up in a crash.’ As of last night, the FIA had not formally asked Mercedes for an explanation. If they intervene at all it will be low-key and private, in keeping with the style of FIA president Jean Todt. That contrasts sharply with the previous regime of Max Mosley. Under his aegis, the FIA would doubtless by now have written to Mercedes demanding an explanation of Hamilton’s claims. The FIA were heavily involved in 2007 when Hamilton and Fernando Alonso fought for the title, only to lose to Kimi Raikkonen. One incident that year was similar to the upstairs-downstairs press conferences in Spa. It came when Hamilton and Alonso sat in front of the media minutes after the Spaniard had prevented his team-mate from doing a final qualifying lap at the Hungarian Grand Prix. Hamilton was a ball of fury. Alonso ate a pear feverishly. That rivalry ended — amid the wider furore of Spygate — in Alonso leaving McLaren. So how can Mercedes cope with their troublesome twosome? It appears to be a near helpless situation. Too much enmity has built up through a season of niggle — arguably because of a lack of firmness from, and respect for, the Mercedes bosses. Evidently, their drivers ignore instructions. Wolff has said he will think what censure they can impose on their drivers in future. But will they really listen? It seems likely to be a dirty fight of mutual distrust up to the final race in Abu Dhabi, with only self-preservation governing the pair. And I suspect that when the season ends, one of them — probably the loser — will seek a new team.

"With his declamatory Scottish tones and often damning catchphrases — diabolical, woeful, shocking, abysmal, time and time again — Alan Hansen does not immediately strike the viewer as a man beset by self-doubt. Just as the memory of his elegant defending at the back of some of the greatest Liverpool teams does not reveal a man of a nervous disposition. But the real Hansen, who retires from two decades of authoritative football punditry after Sunday’s World Cup final, possesses a sensitive core.

We glimpsed it when his eyes welled up during the Hillsborough segment of the last BBC Sports Personality of the Year show and in a tribute to be aired tonight he and his family have explained how this ‘wee boy from Sauchie’ is really a softy at heart. But, first, to the beginning of Hansen’s sporting journey. Despite being raised in a village in the central lowlands of Scotland, where, as Hansen puts it, you played football . . . or played football, his first love was golf. And it was as a golfer that the young Hansen wanted to make his career. He changed direction after watching Partick Thistle beat mighty Celtic in the Scottish League Cup final in 1971. Although Hansen had thought about studying history at Aberdeen University or PE at college, he joined his brother John by signing for Partick. Football, he admits, was almost the last resort.

Start as you mean to go on: Souness, Hansen and Dalglish lift the FA Charity Shield at Wembley after beating West Ham in 1980 . After four years at Firhill, he moved to Bob Paisley’s Liverpool in 1977. ‘I was very shy and introverted,’ says Hansen. ‘I went to Liverpool at 21. I felt out of my depth. I was so nervous that I didn’t want to be there. I didn’t want to leave Scotland. The more experienced I got at Liverpool, I’m thinking the nerves will disappear. ‘They got worse. I would sit in the dressing room with the programme — I’d never warm up — singing the Billy Joel line “Don’t Go Changing”. Underneath I am churning. I was scared.’ He would always touch the ‘This is Anfield’ sign with both hands and suddenly there was ‘not a nerve in my body,’ transforming him into the strolling presence that won eight League titles, three European  Cups and two FA Cups — a dazzling c.v. which included captaining the club to the 1986 double.

"For just a moment there, followers of the English game wore a worried countenance. For much of 2014, Lee Westwood, Ian Poulter and Luke Donald were sliding alarmingly down the world rankings and there were few signs of players of similar calibre ready to step forward to take their place. Was the English game regressing towards the darkness endured at the start of this millennium, when Westy marched a lonely stride among the world’s top 100? Andy Sullivan beat former Masters champion Charl Schwartzel in sudden death to win the South African Open . Now, a new year begins with no such anxieties. Not only is there every hope the aforementioned trio will enjoy a revival, there have been pleasing scenes coming out of Africa regarding the next wave. It was encouraging enough when Yorkshireman Danny Willett managed to hold off the silken swings of the South Africans to win the Sun City Challenge before Christmas. Then, on Sunday, Midlander Andy Sullivan beat former Masters champion Charl Schwartzel in sudden death to become only the second Englishman after Tommy Horton in 1970 to win the South African Open — after The Open, the oldest trophy in the game. The scale of these triumphs should not be underplayed. OK, many of the world’s best were not there, but South Africa has so many proven winners who are particularly effective on home soil. This was a spectacular double for the Spaceman (Sullivan) and the Preacher’s Son (Willett). Sullivan become only the second Englishman after Tommy Horton in 1970 to claim golf's oldest trophy . Sullivan earned his moniker following a hole-in-one last year with its unique prize of a trip into space, while Willett will probably never be able to escape reference to the Dusty Springfield classic given his father is a Church of England vicar. Completing a quartet of rich, regional accents is the personable 23-year-old Lancastrian Tommy Fleetwood and Matt Fitzpatrick from Sheffield. Fleetwood begins the three- tournament Desert Swing in the Middle East this week, knowing that if he can clamber into the world’s top 50 — he is currently 52nd — by the end of March, he will join Willett at the Masters in April. Danny Willett celebrates victory at the Gary Player Country Club in Sun City, South Africa . Former US Amateur champion Fitzpatrick, fresh from earning his tour card at the age of just 20, finished in the top five in his first event, the South African Open. Then from the South, there’s Eddie Pepperell from Oxford and Tyrrell Hatton from High Wycombe, who are both more than capable of achieving their first wins this year. Plenty of positive vibes for the English game, therefore, at the start of another campaign. Quote of the week . ‘Golf would not be dying if more people played the way we play out here. We’ve just taken two-and-a-half hours, including a 19th hole to settle a tied score. It’s not that hard to do.’ As one keen golfer sets out on the last few holes of his term as US President, another White House wannabe Jeb Bush — son of one former incumbent and brother of another — declares how he likes to play the game. We might not come close to agreement on anything else he believes in, but I think we can surely give him a round of applause on this one. Tiger Woods set to make his first appearance at the Waste Management Open since 2001 . By the time he gets to Phoenix, there will, assuredly, be pandemonium. As if the last weekend in January wasn't busy enough for Arizona’s largest city, with the Super Bowl coming to town and the Waste Management Open, which regularly attracts the largest, booziest crowd in the sport — always more than 500,000 spectators for the week — also taking place. Now, Tiger Woods has announced he will begin his season with a first appearance in the WMO since 2001. I don’t know who was first to cast eyes on the raucous hordes and wittily proclaim it would be better known as the Wasted Management Open. But I've a feeling it might apply more than ever this year. Will Sky fall in on The Open? Ever since the subject was first raised in these pages three years ago, the possibility of the BBC losing The Open to Sky following nearly 60 years of coverage has rumbled menacingly beneath the surface. The corporation’s plight was not helped when the Royal and Ancient’s American equivalent, the United States Golf Association, signed away the rights to the US Open to brash newcomer Fox Sports, after decades on NBC. Rory McIlroy with the Claret Jug after winning the Open at Royal Liverpool Golf Club in 2014 . Now the tendering process is under way, will the R&A cash in as well? Given their mandate is to look after the best interests of the game, it is to be hoped not. How can it help golf to take live coverage of its most prestigious competition off terrestrial television, . thereby cutting its viewing figures by three-quarters and depriving curious youngsters of a vital opportunity to watch? Against that, the BBC are said to be disillusioned. The contract ends next year, and right now it is not easy to see how this is going to end well for the R&A game.","Midlander Andy Sullivan become only the second Englishman after Tommy Horton in 1970 to win the South African Open .

"Sympathy towards Nico Rosberg is not the prevailing sentiment in Britain at the moment, but let’s at least try to see if there is another side to the coin. I refer to Rosberg crashing into Lewis Hamilton at last week’s Belgian Grand Prix, a crime that caused the German to be ‘disciplined’ by his Mercedes team on Friday. In fact, I do believe Rosberg was marginally to blame for the second-lap smash. He was behind Hamilton and had a responsibility not to force the issue. But, that point conceded, Hamilton could have left Rosberg more space and still emerged ahead. Hamilton fought to win the corner, rather than the race or the championship. He eschewed pragmatism for instant glory. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Rosberg respond to claims the Spa crash was deliberate . Sorry: Lewis Hamilton (right) said he and Nico Rosberg had 'both made mistakes' in his statement . Damage:  Hamilton (left) and Rosberg clashed on the second lap as the Brit retires from the race . Debris flies: Part of Hamilton's car takes to the air after the clash during a controversial Belgian Grand Prix . Winging it: A piece of Hamilton's wing soars over German Rosberg's Mercedes after the high-speed collision . From the get go: Hamilton got off to the perfect start, overtaking pole position holder Rosberg at the beginning . So, just as his team-mate did, Rosberg resolved not to yield. They crashed. The stewards of the meeting took 10 seconds to dismiss the crash as a ‘racing incident’. Charlie Whiting, the race director, agreed that there was no case to be answered. These things happen; blame can be argued over; there are grey areas. Certainly, no malice aforethought could be proved: Rosberg was more likely to be disadvantaged by such a crash given that a broken front wing was more probable than his sparring partner’s tyre puncturing. Ah, but did not Rosberg admit he crashed deliberately? There is a nuance here. I took Rosberg’s alleged comment to mean he did not squirm out of the way when Hamilton, rightly, did not give way: he thought, to hell with this, I’m not going to be bullied. He did not mean that he set out with the intention of destroying his old friend’s race. The stewards’ decision not to act should have been the end of the matter. But, no, team boss Toto Wolff appeared on TV. I thought he was auditioning for RADA. He said he was incandescent at Rosberg’s foul play. By this point, Wolff had had the chance to speak to Hamilton, whose race had finished prematurely. Was he stoked up by Hamilton? The Brit certainly seems to have provoked Rosberg’s punishment – a six-figure fine – by comparing Wolff to a weak teacher. ‘It reminds me of when I was at school, the teachers will say something but they won’t do anything,’ he said.

Hamilton’s remarks were Formula One’s equivalent of waving an imaginary yellow card at the referee (except this time the two players were, partly, on the same side). To continue the football analogy, Wolff was a weak referee who had allowed a dubious goal to stand and, to atone, went straight down the other end and awarded a penalty to the opposition. He should have brushed the whole incident off, but he did not have the authority to do so, hence Friday’s grandstanding to prove to Hamilton, the Mercedes board and the firing squad on Twitter, that he was in command of the situation and alive to all their concerns. What was arguably worse than Rosberg’s error was Hamilton blurting out the contents of the team’s private post-race meeting. Rosberg, who places emphasis on dealing with matters internally, would never have behaved in this way. I understand that Hamilton’s indiscretion was raised disapprovingly by Wolff and Paddy Lowe, the team’s technical boss, when they met the two drivers yesterday for peace talks. Hamilton nodded in this direction by saying afterwards in a statement: ‘Nico and I accept that we have both made mistakes and I feel it would be wrong to point fingers and say which one is worse than the other.’ That was a grown-up admission to make, and one that reinforces my belief that Rosberg does not deserve all the opprobrium.

"Lewis Hamilton walked disconsolately back from his parked car, an oil leak having ended his participation on the wind-blown tarmac of the Second World War airfield called Silverstone. That was the scene on Friday afternoon in practice for the British Grand Prix — a race that, should Hamilton win, would act as balm for the national sporting mood after our cricketers, our footballers, our rugby players have fallen to defeat home and abroad this year. He had completed just 14 laps in the session, compared to the 35 of his Mercedes team-mate and world championship rival Nico Rosberg. ‘The car was feeling pretty good,’ Hamilton said. ‘I just missed the most important run.

Hamilton is joining in with the patriotic theme, wearing a Union Flag on the underside of his cap peak. ‘It’s always a special weekend for us British drivers,’ he said. ‘Winning this race is like winning an Olympic gold medal. ‘Coming . here, seeing the fans, having already been at Goodwood (for the . Festival of Speed) and seeing how many people were there and the support . coming into this weekend, it’s very exciting, the feeling of being at . home is really a great one. ‘The . support, as I say, for me and Jenson Button and the guys here, it’s . unlike any other place we experience.

I’ll do everything I can to bring at least a little bit of joy . and add to the great success that some of the top athletes have had.’ Standing in his way is Rosberg, the blond assassin who leads him at the top of the standings by 29 points.

By . this point in late afternoon, he knew he was in the clear despite . overtaking the Red Bull of Daniel Ricciardo under a red flag in the . first session. Button . had been moved three places back on the grid for the same infraction in .

Rosberg is sleeping on site in his motorhome. ‘Glamping’ is the new word for it — a contraction of ‘glamorous camping’. Penalty: Nico Rosberg risked a grid penalty at Silverstone for passing drivers under a red flag . Leading the way: Rosberg leads the drivers' championship by 29 points from Lewis Hamilton . Each . of them is trying to find the fractional advantages that can be found . in the minute details. ‘You are looking everywhere to make a difference . but the other guy is too,’ said Hamilton. ‘Everything . is transparent. He knows everything. Nico and I work quite well . together. We are battling each other fiercely, but when Nico does his . debrief he says all that he has to say and vice-versa.

"It is easy to sing hosannas for Max Verstappen, the boy who will make his Formula One debut for Toro Rosso next year at 17 years of age, becoming the youngest driver in the sport’s history. He is a talented driver by all accounts and appeared precociously assured before the assembled media in the paddock in Spa this weekend. Many fellow racers here have given him a generous welcome to the most exclusive drivers’ club in the world. Here is Jenson Button, the 2009 world champion, speaking self-deprecatingly about Verstappen, son of Jos, the Dutch driver of the 1990s and early 2000s. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Who is 16 year old F1 driver Max Verstappen? Ready for the challenge? Max Verstappen, 16, will become the youngest driver in the history of Formula One at 17 years old when he joins the Scuderia Toro Rosso team next season . Centre of attention: Verstappen was composed during his first press conference at Spa in Belgium this week after being announced as Toro Rosso's new driver . ‘I don’t know Max at all,’ said Button. ‘I knew his father because I raced against him, as did Fernando (Alonso) and Kimi (Raikkonen), I think. Somebody obviously thinks he’s ready for Formula One because they have given him the opportunity. ‘I got my drive with Williams when I was 19 years old. I wasn’t ready for Formula One. I was ready when I was 23. But I took the opportunity because it might not come again. Frank (Williams) phoned me up – I was in the pub with my mates having a pint of beer – and said, “Do you think you are ready for Formula One?” I said: “Definitely not”. He said: “OK, right, thank you.” ‘I put the phone down and phoned my dad and he said, “You’re kidding me!” He said: “phone him back and tell him you are.” So I called him back and said I was ready. Frank invited me to the factory and that’s how it all started – I got the test and got the drive. 'For anyone who comes into the sport and is given the opportunity, as a driver, a dad or a manager, you have to take it. Whether Max is ready, nobody knows.’ Ready or not: Jenson Button admitted he wasn't ready for the challenges of Formula One until the age of 23 . Pedigree: Verstappen on the podium during an FIA Formula 3 European Championship race at Silverstone . Button was being very fair. He raised doubts about the suitability of a 17-year-old – which will make him two years younger than the youngest previous driver, Jaime Alguersuari – but cautioned us against judging Verstappen by his own standards between the age of 19 and 23. Jacques Villeneuve, a former team-mate of the young Button at BAR Honda, was less sympathetic towards the experiment. The 1997 world champion, who made his F1 debut aged 24, said: ‘Basically, it’s like getting all the presents without deserving anything. But there is this thing of “the younger, the better”. What's the next step? A team who will sign someone at 15 just to get the image out of it? ‘It is the wrong way round. Caesar and Napoleon were good from the beginning but it takes time before you become an emperor. You build it. ‘He is still a boy so it is very risky. You don’t take a 16-year-old, who hasn’t even been to university, into the best hospital as a doctor, even if he is very good and very intelligent. Sceptical: Former world champion Jacques Villeneuve (left), seen here with Verstappen (right) and his father Jos, said Toro Rosso's appointment represented a big risk . Number one: Verstappen celebrates after winning the Zandvoort Masters of Formula 3 race last month . ‘You need to pay dues. You need to deserve it because that is only how you will become a man.’ Speaking to Autosport, Villeneuve added: ‘Getting a Super Licence (a prerequisite for Formula One) should be meaningful – not just doing three hundred kilometres and it being fine.’ I tend to agree with many of Villeneuve’s observations. Formula One should be the pinnacle; the final logical step in a career through various formulas. That a boy who only started racing cars this year, in Formula Three, can be deemed able to drive in Formula One may reveal how easy it is – in comparison to years gone by – to drive these cars. When Susie Wolff, of Williams, stepped in to test earlier this season, she was alarmingly close to the team’s regular race driver Felipe Massa on the timesheets, and, by all accounts, she is hardly Stirling Moss. But more than anything I hope Max is not burned in the exercise. Being a former Formula One racer while still in his teens would be an unwelcome conclusion to an astonishingly youthful beginning. Bernie Charles Ecclestone, 83 years old, is back in command behind the opaque glass – from the outside that is – of his portable HQ. I suspect the underground movement that pressed for change in their longed-for post-Bernie era will fall silent again now that he is not going to jail for bribery. It was always thus in Formula One. Back in charge: Bernie Ecclestone talks to reporters at Spa in advance of the Belgian Grand Prix. He is once again able to concentrate his energies fully on Formula One following the end of his bribery trial in Germany . One senior paddock figure told me that he would like to excise the whole current crop of drivers. They are, he thought, too highly trained in the dark, spin-doctoring wiles of saying nothing interesting. This view is not entirely misplaced. Nico Rosberg, for example, was coy despite being angry with Lewis Hamilton for not moving over as instructed during the last race in Hungary. Perhaps he was being smart, but some former drivers would have given vent to their feelings. Or, to put it another way, told it how it was. Ditto with Marussia’s Max Chilton and the curious issue of whether he would race this weekend in Belgium. He provided no explanation for his reinstatement a day after announcing he would sit out the grand prix. However, we journalists are not entirely blame-free in all this obfuscation. We criticise people for small slips of the tongue. They clam up more. The relationship between press and participant worsens. It is a vicious circle.

"Lewis Hamilton’s inspiration, of a sort, hid in the trees at the sun-kissed Hockenheim circuit on Friday. At the apex of the Einfahrt Parabolika, the acute right-hander at the end of the first sector, lies the resting place of the man regarded as the greatest motor racing driver produced in Britain — a double world champion cut down in the prime of his life. A simple memorial, encroached upon by weeds, shrouded by firs and white flowers, marks the spot at which Jim Clark — or James Clark as Hamilton recently referred to him — crashed and died during a Formula Two race in April 1968. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Lewis Hamilton and Nico Rosberg put their feud behind them . Getting ready: Lewis Hamilton was fastest in the second session as he bids to secure back-to-back wins . Hiding? The 29-year-old Briton topped the timesheets in the final session on Friday at Hockenheim . Home advantage: Nico Rosberg takes to the Hockenheim circuit ahead of the German Grand Prix . Eyes on the ball: Mercedes drivers Rosberg and Hamilton played on their friendship rather than their rivalry . That Clark even participated in an unglamorous sideshow represents a difference from the Formula One mentality of today: there is no time for anything but the one-dimensional top rung in 2014. The fear of death stalked the paddock in Clark’s day. A few years later another great British champion, James Hunt, said that although people would deny it  forever, they came to see someone get killed. Up on the screens here at Hockenheim they played out old rivalries, Ayrton Senna and Damon Hill among them. Oh, they were less sanitised days. Here the two protagonists for the world championship, Hamilton and Rosberg, were more keen to play on their friendship than play up their animosity. The two Mercedes men arrived for Saturday’s German Grand Prix in the Eichelgarten woods with the comments Hamilton made about Rosberg being less than a genuine Teuton providing the background. Hamilton half-joked that his old mucker was really a Monegasque. He lives in Monaco (as does Hamilton) and grew up there. His father, the 1982 world champion Keke, is Finnish. His mother, Sina, is German. Chase: Hamilton trails Rosberg by four points at the top of the drivers' standings going into Germany . But Rosberg, who leads Hamilton at the top of the drivers’ standings by four points, said: ‘I really don’t get into such things. Everybody’s free to have his opinions. I was there and it was more or less a joke, so for me it’s not relevant. I have two home races.’ This is Rosberg all over: focused, unwilling to countenance distractions. The rivalry may have blown up this season at Monaco, when Rosberg’s diversion off the road brought about a yellow flag that blocked Hamilton’s quest for pole. The Brit thought it deliberate; the German said not. But cordiality has broken out (even if Lewis was not among the small group of family and friends at Rosberg’s wedding to Vivian last week — in Monaco). The corporate blanket has doused the fire. That may be something to do with the predicted attendance of 50,000 for race day, 25,000 short of capacity. ‘We have to analyse the phenomenon,’ admitted Mercedes’s commercial boss Toto Wolff. The other reason for the poor crowd is that home favourite Michael Schumacher is sadly on his back in a Swiss hospital rather than out here racing. Rosberg was fastest in Friday’s first practice session; Hamilton fastest in the second. Red Bull also seem to have narrowed the gap to Mercedes. The consensus is that Hamilton’s win at Silverstone a fortnight ago has given him extra belief, even if he won by default after Rosberg broke down. The other news here was that Susie Wolff, 32-year-old wife of Toto, completed her second and final practice session for Williams. She managed to get herself an £800 fine for speeding in the pit lane. Apart from that it was a respectable showing but, given her age, she probably won’t take part in a race weekend again.","Lewis Hamilton trails Nico Rosberg at top of drivers' standings by four points going into German Grand Prix .

"Anthony Hamilton is the man his son Lewis could not live with, but is now discovering he is someone he cannot live without. During what was the most extraordinary young career motor racing has ever known, Hamilton Snr was the other, no-less important half of the partnership. It was Anthony who provided the bristling competitiveness that railed against any notion that he and his precocious elder son were second to anyone. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Hamilton show off his singing dog Roscoe . Family business: Lewis and Anthony Hamilton thrived in the early years at McLaren, winning a world championship in their second season in Formula One . Pushy for his family, his mind always alert to the next opportunity, an advocate of the highest standards, nobody, including McLaren with all their money that nurtured Lewis’s talent, did more to shape the man who is currently fighting for his second Formula One World Championship title. When Lewis strayed, as he was wont to do, Anthony brought him in line. A trifling but revealing incident: I remember when Lewis was in a bad mood after a grand prix in Germany and wanted to avoid his media commitments. Anthony joined him in the Mercedes that Lewis wanted to act as his get-away car. A few minutes later Lewis got out and returned to the McLaren motorhome. Anthony said to me: ‘I have told him to go back in there and do his job.’ Who is offering the same instruction since Lewis dismissed his father four years ago? Not Mercedes, who treat him with kid gloves. Were Anthony still Lewis’s manager, would he have allowed him to take a dog into the paddock?Would he have allowed him to fly so many tiring long-haul journeys to and from America? Would he have indulged Lewis’s distracting associations with rappers and the wider celebrity whirl? No, no, no. In the shade: Anthony Hamilton was fiercely protective of his eldest son, as several anecdotes reveal . It is not sustainable to suggest – as Mercedes’s yes-men do – that his lifestyle has no impact on his performance. He is operating in a sport that separates the best from the next best by the smallest of margins. It is unimaginable that Lewis, had he developed his talent as he ought, would be sitting second in the table to Nico Rosberg, a decent driver indeed but one who holds the upper hand only by dint of dedicating himself wholly to the task at hand. Nor is this season a one-off. Lewis was out-scored by Jenson Button in their three years together at McLaren. That is a remarkable statistic when one remembers the extent of the young Lewis’s talent and success. The best book written among the flurry of biographies that accompanied Lewis’s early transcendent arrival in Formula One is Mark Hughes’ Lewis Hamilton: The Full Story. It alone saw the full significance of Anthony in the rise of Lewis. I repeat here a telling vignette from the Hamiltons appearance on Blue Peter in 1997. Lewis had uncharacteristically finished fifth in a kart race. Anthony asks him: ‘What’s it doing? Is it gripping up?’ Lewis, lost in thought, shakes his head occasionally and they walk back to the paddock in silence.‘I’m unable to do absolutely anything,’ says Anthony, ‘because you’re not telling me what’s happening.’ They walk on again, silent once more. Celebrity status: Hamilton was pictured this week on a yacht in southern France with Samuel L Jackson and Magic Johnson . The camera cuts, as Hughes recalls, and returns to Lewis some time later. ‘My dad’s pretty hard on me,’ he says. ‘And when it’s not going to plan he’s even harder. But we’re a team and we work together.’ Lewis then thinks again and adds: ‘If my dad gave me advice about the track I wouldn’t take it because he doesn’t know what it’s like out there. I didn’t really give dad much advice (about the karting problem) but I’ve told him now and I think he’d going to try the old settings.’ Lewis won the next race by miles. Their closeness and their friction produced results. Nothing can replicate that bond. Staring into space: Hamilton trails Mercedes team-mate Nico Rosberg by 29 points . I . understand that Lewis wants to be his own man and escape his father’s . control. That is natural, and it may help him in the long term. But . if I were Lewis Hamilton and I was really more serious about winning . the world title than anything else, I would ditch Simon Fuller’s . management, swallow my pride and ask Anthony to come back as my manager, . travelling companion, conscience and truest supporter. Lewis may well win this year’s championship but even to think that he might not, tells you how much Anthony is missed.","Anthony Hamilton shaped the man who is currently fighting for his second world title .

"Andrey Kuznetsov caused the biggest upset of this Wimbledon so far by beating David Ferrer, the stubborn Spaniard and No 7 seed.

The summer of British sport had finally found its winner to hail. The Union Flags were waved and he spun his Mercedes in celebratory doughnuts. ‘Jeez, I can’t believe it,’ said Lewis Hamilton, the Dr Jekyll who won despite starting as Mr Hyde as sixth on the grid. Once he had driven across the grass to get closer to the fans on that euphoric lap of honour, up on the podium he was handed the winner’s trophy - a plastic toy that would not have passed muster in Hamleys: a lattice work of red in the image of the sponsors, Santander.

This bauble had sadly replaced The Royal Automobile Club Trophy, which was originally awarded at the first Grand Prix staged at Silverstone in 1948. ‘Where’s the gold trophy, man?’ asked Hamilton, who is a notably more attached to his awards than most drivers. The proper trophy, which is always guarded by heavies, awaited him in the press conference room, standing on the table between the winner and Valtteri Bottas, who took second place for Williams with a fine drive. ‘I grew up seeing trophies like this one — real trophies,’ said Hamilton. ‘While it is a real privilege being on top of the podium, my trophy fell to pieces. It must have cost £10. It’s so bad. ‘I might just get the plaque, which is the most expensive part of it. These trophies are what you have to show for your lifetime’s achievements. I hope we can get some better ones in future.’ The trophy was later escorted to the Mercedes motorhome in the paddock, before returning to its case at the RAC, Pall Mall.

He started down the grid because of perhaps the strangest mistake of his Formula One career: he aborted his final qualifying lap, not realising he could have improved his time on the later and drier section of the track. Rosberg carried on and took pole, making him favourite to extend his 29-point lead in the duel between the two men driving the Silver Arrows. Hamilton, though, charged up at the start into fifth by the first corner and fourth within a flash. Later in the race, having jinked his way to second place in his super-fast Mercedes, he was closing on Rosberg at the rate of about a second a lap. There was a good chance he would have passed his rival in any event, but he did not need to because Rosberg’s gearbox failed halfway through. The German sat on the grass, waving away a marshal while he attempted to restart his machine. He finally conceded defeat and walked away, his race over.

Pivotal: It could be a key moment in the season for the man who currently leads the standings . Hamilton had no challenger from that moment onwards. ‘Every lap I was saying to the car, “don’t break down”.’ It did not and he won by 30 seconds. It may not have been his 67sec demolition in the wet here in 2008 — arguably the best of his 27 victories — but its significance was immense. Had he lost further ground to Rosberg, especially following his qualifying faux pas, the psychological advantage would have been squarely with the German. Now the gap stands at four points going into the next race, at Hockenheim a week on Sunday. Hamilton deserved his slice of fortune after suffering a race-ending technical gremlin at the opening race in Australia. This evens out the score — the problem Hamilton suffered in Canada, it seems, was because he did not change his brake bias and over-worked his rear brakes. Away from the leading pair, it was an eventful race from the start. Kimi Raikkonen crashed heavily on the first lap along the Wellington straight while accelerating to 180mph. He ran off the track, came back on, spun off and hit the barrier with an impact of 47G before skewing back across the tarmac, taking Felipe Massa’s Williams with him. He went to the medical centre with bruised knees and ankles. The barrier had come off worse. It took an hour to mend, the long red-flag delay something of an irritant to the 112,000 crowd. Chasing pack: Four-time champion Sebastian Vettel leads the hunt for  Hamilton . Header: Hamilton extended a big lead on the chasing pack and eventually won by almost 30 seconds . The racing excitement centred on Ferrari’s Fernando Alonso and Red Bull’s Sebastian Vettel. Alonso swept past Vettel on the outside of Copse; they then diced with eachother — the wheels of one fitting like a jigsaw piece into the curves of the other’s chassis — until the Red Bull man finally overtook the Ferrari to claim fifth place. ‘It got a little bit silly,’ said Vettel of the joust and the frantic radio exchanges. 1. Mercedes - 326 pts . 2. Red Bull - 168 pts . 3. Ferrari - 106 pts . 4. Williams - 103 pts . 5. Force India - 91 pts . There were nearly two British drivers on the podium through Jenson Button, but he could not quite catch Daniel Ricciardo’s Red Bull. ‘It was almost a great day,’ lamented the McLaren driver. ‘I think one more lap would have done it. Sometimes it works out and sometimes it doesn’t. ‘We definitely gave it our all. To get fourth is far better than we expected. Maybe the time I get on the podium will be when I win.’ It was a bitter-sweet experience in another way for Button as he paid tribute to his father John, a universally liked paddock figure who died in January. Jenson donned a pink helmet and fans wore pink shirts — the colour John put on for luck on race days. #PinkforPapa: Button and his girlfriend Jessica Michibata wearing pink t-shirts before the race . So close: Button, wearing a special pink helmet in memory of his father, came so close to a podium finish .

He would have been a very happy man.’ Just as Lewis’s father Anthony was. An occasional caller these days, he smiled as the national anthem played.

"On December 8, 2006, Jose Mourinho was midway through a season that would see him deliver the FA Cup and League Cup double when he famously quipped about his ‘untouchable’ players. ‘Claude Makelele is untouchable because of the way he plays. Michael Essien is untouchable because of the way he plays. It is not because I love them,’ he said, pointing out that £30.8million Andriy Shevchenko was not part of the gang. So, Makelele was one, Essien was another, as was Michael Ballack, Ashley Cole, Ricardo Carvalho, Frank Lampard, John Terry, Didier Drogba and Petr Cech. Chelsea's Claude Makelele (left), Ricardo Carvalho (centre) and Frank Lampard were 'untouchables' Makelele and Lampard celebrate with Michael Essien, another Chelsea star that was 'untouchable' Michael Ballack and Didier Drogba were among those named as Jose Mourinho's 'untouchable' players . Chelsea's six 'untouchables' were named in the starting XI to face Burnley. They are Terry, Ivanovic, Matic, Fabregas, Hazard and Costa. Azpilicueta, Cahill and Willian – all not 'untouchable' – were bumped as Luis, Zouma and Cuadrado were selected. Nine in total that never needed to worry about whether their name was or wasn’t on the team sheet when it was pinned on the board. They were the permanent fixtures and, nine years on, the idea hasn’t changed. Terry, Branislav Ivanovic, Nemanja Matic, Cesc Fabregas, Eden Hazard and Diego Costa are the automatic picks these days. Choose any at random and there’s method in Mourinho’s madness. Hazard, for example, is a given. Dribbles and chances created  aside, he has turned buying fouls into an art form. Nine against Paris-Saint Germain – a record in the Champions League this season. As well as 28 fouls in Europe this year – more than any other player – and 74 in the Barclays Premier League – again, more than anyone else. Terry, the club captain, is the leader. Ivanovic, blood-stained boots et al, is the warrior. And so on. Eden Hazard is fouled during Chelsea's 1-1 draw with Paris Saint-Germain in the Champions League . Hazard has turned buying fouls into an art form as he was fouled nine times against French club PSG . Hazard of Chelsea sits on the pitch after being fouled during their Champions League match on Tuesday . Yet what about those not free from rotation? The healthy competition among the rest starts at the back between goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois and Petr Cech. So much so that Mourinho likes to imagine football as being about nine outfield players and two goalkeepers. ‘We would give no chance to anyone,’ he says, imaging that scenario. ‘We would be absolutely phenomenal because they’re both phenomenal.’ He’s not wrong. Courtois is close to ‘untouchable’ but not quite. His error against Manchester City at Stamford Bridge on January 31 – failing to collect a Jesus Navas cross under pressure from James Milner – allowed David Silva to equalise. It led to speculation Cech would reappear in Paris on Tuesday night, particularly given he has yet to concede in 426 minutes of Premier League football this year. He didn’t, Courtois remained, and it proved the right call. Courtois made five saves against PSG – some point blank, some pure reaction – helping Chelsea escape the French capital with an away goal and the advantage at 1-1. As Mourinho repeats, if a player is to become ‘untouchable because of the way he plays’, then the ex-Atletico Madrid loanee did himself no harm. Petr Cech (left) was once 'untouchable' but has since been given  competition by Thibaut Courtois (right) Chelsea goalkeeper Courtois makes a save during the Champions League round of 16 first leg in Paris . Courtois pulled off five saves against PSG on Tuesday night to help Chelsea escape with a 1-1 advantage . And so to another contest at Chelsea, between Kurt Zouma and Gary Cahill. The latter may previously have been considered ‘untouchable’, but that’s changed. Zouma, particularly against Manchester City at Stamford Bridge, looks far from a 20-year-old newbie. That perfectly-timed tackle on Aguero, for example, showed experience beyond the France youth’s years. Yet against PSG, Cahill and his 33 England caps were preferred by Mourinho. Zlatan Ibrahimovic, all 6ft 3in of the Sweden international, tormented the defender. Cahill was arguably at fault for Edinson Cavani’s goal, too, misjudging the cross and allowing the forward to nod the ball beyond a helpless Courtois. Not the most convincing performance if he is to persuade Mourinho to prefer him over Zouma. This is a position very much available, and Chelsea captain Terry sympathises with the one that loses out: ‘Obviously we all want to play every game. 'Those two are fighting it out at the moment but it could be me at any time. What’s important is that we remain top of the league and everybody gets game time.’ Kurt Zouma (left) and Gary Cahill (right) are fighting for a place in Mourinho's Chelsea side . Zouma is looking to steal Cahill's place in the Chelsea starting XI as the youngster impresses Mourinho . Another battle at the back is between Filipe Luis and Cesar Azpilicueta. Yet the latter has made twice as many appearances (20) as the former (10) in the Premier League this year. Luis last played in the Premier League more than a month ago against Swansea City at the Liberty Stadium on January 17, when Azpilicueta was absent due to a groin injury. The former Atletico Madrid left-back was used in the two Capital One Cup legs against Liverpool but the £16m buy has not made an appearance in February yet. Azpilicueta AKA ‘Dave’ relishes the healthy battle, most likely because he is winning. ‘In the big teams, there is always competition and the competition helps us to improve,' he said before Christmas. 'I like the competition and fight for my place every day. 'I like the competition because it brings you to another level, and it’s down to each player to impress the manager and make it difficult for him.’ Luis, playing second fiddle, is losing this contest and there doesn't seem to be a whole lot he can do about it. Filipe Luis (left) and Cesar Azpilicueta (right) are competing for the left-back position at Chelsea . Azpilicueta high fives goalkeeper Courtois during their Champions League match in the French capital . The newest addition to Chelsea’s squad, Juan Cuadrado, has arrived to interrupt Willian’s otherwise must-pick status. In seven fewer appearances in Serie A, Cuadrado has  twice as many goals (4) and assists (4) as Willian in the Premier League. He has also created more chances (36) and shots on target (20) than Willian (26 and 15). It was Cuadrado that registered more assists (4) than any other player at the 2014 World Cup in Brazil, too. Willian has been Mourinho’s first-choice right winger this year. Yet perhaps his shortcomings in the final third can see his Colombian counterpart – a £23.3m buy rising to £26.8m from Fiorentina – capitalise. Comparing one player’s form in Serie A to another’s in the Premier League can only be used to an extent, but the numbers speak for themselves. Cuadrado seems to know a thing or two about winning fouls as, like Hazard, he has won 87 in just 1,450 minutes of football. Yet he must replicate his performances from Italy, if he is to keep Willian out. Time will tell. Willian (left) and new addition Juan Cuadrado (right) are competing to play under Mourinho . Cuadrado comes on for Willian during the Champions League match between Chelsea and PSG . Click here to read Martin Samuel's match report from the Parc des Princes . Those that live on the fringe of Mourinho’s team often can’t hack it. The ‘reject XI’ that have left the club since Mourinho’s return to Chelsea in 2013 is telling. Mark Schwarzer in goal, with Ryan Bertrand, David Luiz, Jeffrey Bruma and Ashley Cole filling a back four. Then, there’s Essien and Lampard in midfield – both former ‘untouchable’ players – behind Andre Schurrle, Juan Mata and Kevin De Bruyne. And, as a lone striker, Romelu Lukaku. Mourinho is not afraid to rotate the big names, and get rid. Lampard, now at Manchester City, knows that better than most. ‘I’m not the kind of coach that gives places to people just because they are faces or names,’ the Chelsea manager announced in 2007. ‘Everybody with me has to fight for his place.’ The  roles of Terry, Ivanovic, Matic, Fabregas, Hazard and Costa have made them immune to being dropped. It’s now up to the others to join them on the pedestal. Chelsea's Branislav Ivanovic pictured during the Champions League last-16 tie on Tuesday night .

Chelsea will line up against London rivals Spurs in the Capital One Cup final at Wembley on Sunday . EDEN HAZARD v KYLE WALKER . Hazard is surely the player Spurs are most scared of — he’s Chelsea’s match-winner. The Belgian has scored in both games against Spurs this season but a third would be the most important. Walker is a tremendous athlete who can match him for pace and power. But the runs Hazard makes in behind the full back are brilliant and Walker can sometimes be bamboozled by movement like that. He will need to have the game of his life. Kyle Walker will be tasked with stopping Eden Hazard who has scored in both games against Spurs this term . DIEGO COSTA v ERIC DIER . The Chelsea striker has been trying to make it out that he’s being picked on and I can’t stop laughing. He’s an absolute beast and can handle himself. He is a match-winner, Chelsea’s battering ram and focal point and Dier will be up against it. Dier is only 21 but he’s quick and strong. Like all young players he has had a few iffy moments and this cup final will be another level up for him. But he’s talented and with a few early touches to calm the nerves, he can compete. Young Spurs defender Eric Dier is up against it with the Premier League's joint top scorer Diego Costa . CESC FABREGAS v RYAN MASON . Mason was rested in the Europa League on Thursday and that shows you how highly rated he is by Mauricio Pochettino. The middle of the park is where the game is won and lost and Mason must and can get after Fabregas. He can’t let Fabregas dictate the game, he must hurry him up all the time, make him uncomfortable. I like Mason. Some players kick a ball and others pass it. He passes it. He’ll be nervous — I remember cramping up in my first Wembley final — but he is key to Tottenham winning. Ryan Mason must find a way to stop Cesc Fabregas from dictating the game from midfield . KURT ZOUMA or GARY CAHILL v HARRY KANE . Mourinho has a big decision: the experience of Cahill or Zouma, his new go-to man against Spurs’ biggest weapon. Cahill should have been sent off in the 5-3 defeat by Spurs for kicking out at Kane so I would not be surprised to see Zouma start. His pace and power could see him get the nod. I’ll be at Wembley with Sky and I can’t wait to see Kane in this game. He’ll be so excited, dying to show everyone what he can do. If he performs and Tottenham win, he’ll cement his place as an icon at Spurs for years to come. Tottenham's goalscoring expectations will rest on the young shoulders of Harry Kane (centre) Jose Mourinho has a selection dilemma in deciding between Kurt Zouma and Gary Cahill in defence .","Chelsea face Tottenham in the Capital One Cup final on Sunday .
Kyle Walker must stop Eden Hazard running at Spurs .
Eric Dier has his work cut out handling top scorer Diego Costa .
Ryan Mason can't allow Cesc Fabregas to dictate play from midfield .
Either Gary Cahill of Kurt Zouma will be tasked with containing Harry Kane ."
"On September 2, 2013, when Gareth Bale was presented to more than 30,000 spectators inside the Bernabeu, he stood before them, smiling awkwardly, desperately trying to recollect those Spanish phrases he memorised. A few sentences in the local lingo – all in that recognisable Welsh accent – and his romantic introduction to Spanish football was official. ‘Hala Madrid,’ he yelled, and a roar replied. Yet the patience £86million buys you comes with an expiration date, it seems. The now infamous reaction of Cristiano Ronaldo when Gareth Bale failed to pass to him during Real Madrid's La Liga match against Espanyol at the Bernabeu last month . The pair in happier times, when Real Madrid beat Bayern Munich en route to European glory in 2014 . Ronaldo celebrates with Bale after scoring a low free-kick to complete a 4-0 rout of Bayern last season . Even winning the Champions League, Copa del Rey, FIFA Club World Cup and UEFA Super Cup in less than 18 months doesn’t make you immune to those Spanish whistles. They weren’t deafening. Far from it. But they were there, loud enough to discern. The thing is, the Bernabeu boo boys can be the harshest critics in football. Maybe it’s a rite of passage. Alfredo di Stefano, a Real Madrid legend in every sense of the word, was whistled on occasion. So, too, was Zinedine Zidane. There was also Manuel Velazquez, Rafael Martin Vazquez, Michel, Emilio Butragueno, and, more recently, Iker Casillas. Even the great Alfredo Di Stefano (right), seen here with Raymond Kopa and the European Cup in 1957, was not immune to the Bernabeu boo boys . Zinedine Zidane, who helped Real win their ninth European Cup in 2002, was also booed on occasion . Bale in action for Real during their midweek Liga win over Sevilla, a result that kept them top of the table . Even Cristiano Ronaldo has been subject to it. Whistling and booing let rip in the 76th minute against Rayo Vallecano on March 29, 2014 – when Real Madrid were already 4-0 up – because the former Manchester United great did not pass to Alvaro Morata. Spanish newspaper Marca dedicated a story to it headlined: ‘Ball hogger.’ Carlo Ancelotti was flabbergasted. ‘I understand booing every now and then when we have deserved it,’ the manager began, before adding: ‘But booing Cristiano is not so easy to understand.’ The infamous 'Ball Hogger' headline that appeared in Spanish sports newspaper Marca . Real Madrid coach Carlo Ancelotti could not comprehend the booing of Cristiano Ronaldo . Bale celebrates after his sensational goal against Barcelona delivered Real the Copa del Rey last season . Bale then scored a crucial extra time goal in Real's win over Atletico Madrid in the Champions League final . It meant the world's most expensive signing ended his first season as a European champion . Bale also helped Real lift the European Super Cup against Sevilla in his home city of Cardiff in August . Even Rafa Nadal – yes, the tennis player – chipped in: ‘It wasn’t right. The problem with sport, and with life, is that you can go from 0 to 100, and 100 to 0 in days. Real looked like they were going to win the league and three days later everything is a disaster.’ He had a point. Tensions were high. They had gone 31 games unbeaten, only to lose 4-3 against Barcelona then 2-1 against Sevilla. But to boo a man with 28 goals in 27 appearances in La Liga? Perhaps that demonstrates how callous the Bernabeu can be, even when 4-0 up in front of a depleted 60,174 attendance. A tough crowd. Chances created - 25 (joint 17th in La Liga) Assists - 5 (joint 6th in La Liga) Bale is in illustrious company, then. Yet the reports in Spain – that he is the latest to be hounded – exaggerate. Is the only Brit at the Bernabeu an easy target? Being the world’s most expensive footballer brings expectation, and Bale has not met them this year. Nowhere near, in fact. Compare him to his fellow forwards – Ronaldo, James Rodriguez, Isco, and Karim Benzema – and Bale is far off. His shooting accuracy (51.72 per cent) is the worst. He’s made the least passes (508) – this particular statistic far from helping the ‘selfish’ tag bestowed upon him – and has had just 287 touches of the ball. Even Isco has had 1,264 in 329 fewer minutes played. Assists this year? Bale (5) is joint sixth in La Liga. That’s still less than Ronaldo (9), James (7), Isco (7) and Benzema (8). Turn to chances created, and Bale (25) is joint 17th. Way behind Lionel Messi (55), James (49), Toni Kroos (44) and Ronaldo (43). Even Isco (29) and Marcelo (25) have as many. Ronaldo is enjoying an exceptional season, having scored 36 goals in 31 matches across all competitions . Colombian star James Rodriguez has also been out-performing Bale in many areas this season . Barcelona's Lionel Messi is leading the way in terms of chances created in the Spanish league . This dip in form hasn't helped the talking points. Against Valencia on January 4, Bale could and should have passed to Benzema. He didn’t, the criticism built, and Real’s 22-match winning streak ended in a 2-1 defeat. Ronaldo, the man caught winking at the 2006 World Cup following Wayne Rooney’s dismissal, should know those pesky cameras don’t miss a thing. He was beamed around the world, hands on hips, shaking his head, huffing and puffing in disapproval. Then, against Espanyol on January 10, Bale failed to assist Ronaldo in a two-on-one chance. The three-time Ballon d’Or winner’s body language said it all, even though they were 2-0 up at the time. ‘Why. Did. You. Not. Pass,’ Spanish newspaper AS tweeted, before labelling him ‘ball hog Bale’ on their front page the day after. The picture of an exasperated Cristiano Ronaldo after Gareth Bale failed to release the ball to him . There have been occasions this season when Bale could have chosen a better pass . Yet we should note, since Bale moved to Madrid on September 1, 2013, he has assisted Ronaldo eight times. Vice versa, Ronaldo has set Bale up just once, against Malaga on November 29, 2014. Bale was asked how he had the audacity to shoot against Espanyol. ‘All I can remember is that I was going through on goal and I wanted to score,’ he told El Larguero. A forward doing what a forward should. And so to their 4-1 win over Real Sociedad on January 31, when Bale took the ball off James – 12 yards out with goalkeeper Geronimo Rulli in no man's land – and missed. The criticism grew. Even on Wednesday, in a 2-1 win over Sevilla, he was scrutinised. Another two-on-one scenario squandered, apparently. The opening exchanges of Ancelotti’s press conference in the aftermath were spent discussing Bale. The Real Madrid manager answered: ‘That again? The run was fantastic and at the end he took the right decision. I can’t ask any more of him.’ Bale reacts after seeing a chance go begging against Real Sociedad at the end of last month . We forget in between all this Ronaldo was sent off for his violent outburst, and Bale was relied upon to score an 89th-minute penalty to beat Cordoba. There when needed. So, is this a dead debate? This is a guy that left Marc Bartra in his dust in the Copa del Rey final to beat Barcelona with a 60-metre dash at 16.7mph. The man that helped win La Decima – their 10th European Cup – with a nod of the head. The player that upheld the tradition of British wingers scoring on their Real Madrid debut, emulating Laurie Cunningham and David Beckham. Sportsmail’s Pete Jenson reminded us last week of a well-known sketch on Monty Python’s Life of Brian that can relate. It goes: ‘Apart from the sanitation, medicine, education, wine, public order, irrigation, roads, the fresh water system and public health, what have the Romans ever done for us?’ Those at the Bernabeu should ask themselves that same question with Bale. September 1, 2013: Bale signs for Real Madrid for a world record fee of £86million . September 14: The Welshman scores on his Real Madrid debut in a 2-2 draw with Villarreal . October 30: Scores two and assists two on his first home start at the Bernabeu . November 30: First hat-trick - a 'perfect' one too - for Real Madrid, against Valladolid . April 16, 2014: Bale scores the winning goal in the Copa del Rey final against Barcelona. His first goal against Madrid's bitter rivals, and his 20th of the season . May 24: The former Spurs man scores a goal in extra time in the Champions League final, which Madrid go on to win 4-1... it's a record 10th European title for the Spanish side . August 12: Bale's third trophy at Madrid - the European Super Cup. He sets up the first of Ronaldo's two goals in his home city of Cardiff . December 20: Another trophy for the Welshman, and a goal in this final too. Real Madrid beat San Lorenzo 2-0 to win the FIFA Club World Cup, with Bale netting the second . December 23: Reports surface of a potential exit, and 54 per cent of Real Madrid fans would be happy to see him leave for the right price .","Gareth Bale has been jeered by the Real Madrid fans on occasion this year .

"It became as certain as death and taxes that England's finest would be embarrassed, dismantled and have their backsides handed to them on a silver platter in Europe this week. But the race to find a place at European football's top table back at home continues. Just once in the Barclays Premier League's 22-year history has it been as tight between third and seventh by February 28, and not even Arsene Wenger – the top four guru himself – can call this one. Five clubs. Two places. Arsenal, Manchester United, Southampton, Liverpool and Tottenham Hotspur are on 48, 47, 46, 45 and 44 points respectively and, like Bruce Forsyth preached on Play Your Cards Right, it’s points that make prizes. Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger (left) and Manchester United boss Louis van Gaal (right) are in the running . Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers (left) and Southampton's Ronald Koeman (right) are fighting for a place . Tottenham Hotspur manager Mauricio Pochettino is bringing up the rear in the race to qualify for Europe . A game-by-game graph that shows how the race for Champions League qualification is hotting up . And Arsenal are silently racking them up. Finishing in the top four has, in some cruel corners, been labelled The Wenger Trophy. Yet true to form they have crept to third while the rest scrap among themselves. Arsenal last finished outside the top four in 1996 and, if the remaining 12 fixtures in the Premier League are anything to go by, then Wenger can expect same old, same old. On paper they have the easiest run-in, if there is such a thing. Arsenal have to play just three of the seven teams at the top of the Premier League, while Manchester United face five. It could spell make or break for those two when, on May 16, they meet for the penultimate weekend of the season at Old Trafford. Manchester United captain Wayne Rooney and his team-mates have a tough task on their hands to qualify . Ander Herrera, Robin van Persie and Rooney (from left to right) pictured during their defeat by Swansea City . Manchester United have their work cut out for them if they are to qualify for the Champions League, as they face five of the current top seven before the season's end on May 24. MAR 15 - Tottenham Hotspur (h) MAR 22 - Liverpool (a) APR 12 - Manchester City (h) APR 18 - Chelsea (a) MAY 16 - Arsenal (h) Santi Cazorla and his Arsenal team-mates appear to have the best run-in when the fixtures are broken down . Yet Southampton – the club that were priced at 6/1 pre-season to be relegated, having lost Luke Shaw, Adam Lallana, Dejan Lovren, Calum Chambers, Rickie Lambert, chairman Nicola Cortese and manager Mauricio Pochettino – will want to have a say. Four years ago this very weekend, Southampton were scrapping in League One, losing 1-0 against Walsall in front of a 4,684 attendance. From the third tier to the first; from Bovril to champagne; from Walsall to, just maybe, Barcelona, Madrid, Munich, Paris? They have never finished in the top four of the Premier League, but last did so in Division One in 1984. Arsenal, meanwhile, did so last year, as did Liverpool. Manchester United two years ago, and Tottenham three. Southampton need only to maintain the momentum that kept them inside the top four for 18 weeks this season – more than Manchester United (15), Arsenal (5), Tottenham (1) and Liverpool (1). Ronald Koeman’s team are the romantic option to be among Europe’s elite. Yet in February they lost against Liverpool, were held by West Ham, beaten by Swansea City and can’t ride on the coattails of their early-season form for much longer. Raheem Sterling celebrates scoring against Southampton as Liverpool beat the top four pretenders 2-0 . Liverpool saw off Southampton 2-0 as Ronald Koeman's men suffered a dip in form throughout February . Liverpool's incredible Premier League form in 2015 has seen them become top four contenders again . Southampton need to maintain the momentum that kept them inside the top four for 18 weeks this season . Form comes as easily as it goes. Liverpool – unbeaten in 10 Premier League matches – are a vastly different prospect to the team that surrendered at the Bernabeu on November 4. It took them five years to return to the most prestigious European stage, only to end in a 1-0 defeat by Real Madrid and a 2-1 loss against Chelsea in the Premier League four days later. It took cojones from Brendan Rodgers to field a weakened team against Cristiano Ronaldo et al, and the ends did not justify the means. Yet a miniature head-to-head table between the five clubs chasing Champions League qualification, shown below, puts Liverpool (13 points) ahead of Manchester United (10), Tottenham (8), Southampton (6), and Arsenal (5). A head-to-head table between the five clubs chasing Champions League qualification puts Liverpool top . Liverpool are fighting Southampton and three other clubs to qualify for next season's Champions League . And it’s not the first time they’ve been in a tight corner. The only other occasion the gap between third and seventh was so close was in February 2001. Gerard Houllier’s Liverpool in third were just three points from Leicester City in seventh. Yet even then, they were two games clear of the clubs around them, having been pre-occupied between February 15 and 25 by the FA Cup fifth round, two UEFA Cup fourth round legs, and the League Cup final. Liverpool won all three of those tournaments as Houllier delivered the treble, and a baby-faced, shaven-headed Steven Gerrard was crowned PFA Young Player of the Year. They finished third, going to show the distractions of other competitions and a daunting fixture list doesn’t always shatter domestic form. Fourteen years on, the Liverpool captain may settle for fourth and a few tears on his farewell for LA, whether that is at Stoke on May 24 or Wembley in the FA Cup final on May 30. But their old nemesis Manchester United could, potentially, ruin both. Louis van Gaal's team are live on television six times before the end of April – more than Liverpool (5), Arsenal (4), Tottenham (4) and Southampton (2) – but that could suit those more inclined to schadenfreude. They're fourth, but have been winning ugly, and most supporters sensed their 2-1 defeat by Swansea  last week was coming. With games against Tottenham, Liverpool, Manchester City, Chelsea and Arsenal before the curtain comes down in May, their fate is in their own hands. Gary Neville is 'concerned', Paul Scholes deems them 'miserable', but again, points make prizes, no matter how you get them. If only those at White Hart Lane could have even a smidgen of the same consistency. Steven Gerrard was crowned PFA Young Player of the Year in 2001 - the last time it was so tight in the table . Manchester United's Teddy Sheringham and Liverpool's  Gerrard pose with their awards in 2001 . Liverpool manager Rodgers fielded a weakened side at the Bernabeu in November and lost 1-0 . Tottenham, led by a manager that abandoned St Mary’s in favour of a more likely European candidate in north London, have been hard done by when it comes to the top four. They qualified in 2010, reaching the quarter-finals against Real Madrid, before the heartbreak of 2012. Chelsea were crowned European champions that year, meaning Tottenham missed out on Champions League football. In 2013, too, they missed out by a single point to north London rivals Arsenal. Always the bridesmaid, never the bride, can become a familiar feeling. They can beat Chelsea 5-3 yet lose 2-1 against Stoke. See off Arsenal 2-1 but crumble 2-1 at Crystal Palace. There or thereabouts; almost, but not quite; inconsistent. Pochettino's Tottenham remain in the running for Champions League qualification but can be inconsistent . Tottenham joined the race for the top four with help with in-form striker Harry Kane (centre) None of the five sides going for those two spots have European distractions now, with Liverpool and Spurs exiting the Europa League on Thursday. There is always next year to try again, and the race goes on domestically. So, come May 24, there is the guarantee that each of Wenger, Van Gaal, Koeman, Rodgers and Pochettino will either be reflecting on a job well done, or cursing what-ifs and maybes. For now, with four points between them and 12 weeks remaining, no amount of statistics can determine what order it will finish, no matter how hard we try. It’s open season and the chase is on.","Four points separate Arsenal in third and Tottenham Hotspur in seventh .

"Louis van Gaal, becoming Sir Bobby Robson’s successor at the Nou Camp in 1997, was about to discover his three-year reign in Spain would be unforgiving. ‘I have achieved more with Ajax in six years than Barcelona have in one hundred years,’ he announced. Strike one. The Barcelona press constantly questioned him, such as how can you drop a Brazilian genius and 1999 Ballon d’Or winner? ‘Saying I broke my pact with Rivaldo? I never broke my pact. You’re very bad. Very, very bad. Always negative,’ he replied, met by laughter in the press room. Strike two. Then, in 2000, arrived the parting shot. ‘Friends of the media. I am leaving. Congratulations,’ he uttered, despite having won La Liga twice and Copa del Rey. Strike three. You’re out. Manchester United manager Louis van Gaal holds a press conference on Friday ahead of their FA Cup tie . Van Gaal has been no stranger to press room drama at any of his previous clubs before United . Van Gaal (left) waves in Barcelona and the manager notoriously had problems with Rivaldo (right) Never a stranger to press room drama. He’s a manager that reacts, that acts on instincts. Yet his latest stunt was far more calculated. The Manchester United managers of the 1930s, 1940s, 1950s, and so on weren’t pestered by in-depth statistics. Even Sir Alex Ferguson’s first decade at Old Trafford was free of Opta. Yet Sam Allardyce’s analysis on Sunday – ‘we couldn’t cope with the long balls Manchester United kept putting in the box’ – hit Louis van Gaal where it hurts. It struck a nerve and, in rebuttal, he compiled his own figures in a four-page dossier, courtesy of Prozone. It was unbecoming of a Manchester United manager. Van Gaal – so keen to present the bare bones to Allardyce – forgot about the other skeletons in his closet. Handing out those graphics gave others license to scrutinise his tactics and, by reacting, he was beaten. As the old rule in politics goes: ‘If you’re explaining, you’re losing.’ Van Gaal was clearly annoyed at Sam Allardyce's comments and he had the pamphlet on his desk waiting . Van Gaal looks unimpressed as he tells a packed press conference about his tactics against West Ham . Van Gaal claims United made 49.9 per cent of 'long passes forward' in comparison to West Ham's 71 per cent . West Ham made just 11 of their 32 'long and forward' passes during the match, according to boss Van Gaal . Long pass: A pass that is 35+ yards in distance aimed at a particular team-mate. This doesn’t have to be forward. Long ball: A pass that is 35+ yards in distance launched in to a space/area on the pitch rather than a precise pass to a team-mate (ie. a ball in to the channels). Fulfilling press duties in Spain was testing for Van Gaal, and it hasn’t been dissimilar in England. Since his official welcome on July 16, he’s had to explain his tactics a few times. Why, for example, use Wayne Rooney in midfield? Aren’t you exhausting the faltering partnership of Robin van Persie and Radamel Falcao? What’s happened to Ander Herrera – your first purchase at £29million – and why has he not started a Barclays Premier League game since December 2? Is your less aggressive style of play restricting Angel Di Maria’s influence? And so on. This week the focus switched to passing, or, as Big Sam pointed out, long balls. Yet what is one of those? Opta tell us a long pass ‘is 35+ yards in distance aimed at a particular team-mate’, while a long ball ‘is 35+ yards in distance launched in to a space or area on the pitch rather than a precise pass to a team-mate’. Van Gaal pictured during his team's Premier League match at Old Trafford against Burnley . Van Gaal acknowledges misfiring striker Radamel Falcao at Old Trafford against Burnley . Daley Blind’s assist for Van Persie’s diving header against Spain at the 2014 World Cup, for example, was a long pass – not a long ball – because it was aimed directly at the Holland striker. A difference which Van Gaal made sure we understood with his graphics and diagrams. And so to Wednesday night, when Burnley lost 3-1 at Old Trafford. Did the club second bottom in the Premier League deserve to leave empty handed? Hardly. First, long passes. Manchester United attempted 99, more than Burnley’s 74 and, just to be fair, West Ham’s 74 against Southampton. Their accuracy (56.6 per cent) was superior to Burnley (50) and West Ham (37.8). Their long passes this year (1,960) obliterate the rest of the Premier League. Burnley (1,951) are close behind, before Queens Park Rangers (1,915) come third. This is reflected in possession with their average (59.54 per cent) second only to Manchester City (60.11). Manchester United this season are executing more long balls on average (21.6) than under David Moyes (16.5) or Sir Alex (his most being 20.55 in 2010/11) but, on Wednesday, they knocked far fewer (27) into space than Burnley (37) and West Ham (45). Van Gaal was accused of playing long-ball style but the numbers suggest otherwise (and so does he!) Yet dispelling the long-ball theory does little. This was not a classic performance. Nothing to write home about. Just look at a pick of the reaction to a win that kept them third in the Premier League: . Patience is wearing thin. The man that had the cojones to replace Ajax goalkeeper Jasper Cillessen with Newcastle United’s Tim Krul in the 120th minute of Holland’s 2014 World Cup quarter-final is being questioned. Van Gaal admitted Burnley were the better team. Play like that on Monday against Preston North End and you’ll be out of the FA Cup, he added. He even acknowledged a negative atmosphere. Van Gaal acknowledged a hostile atmosphere at Old Trafford despite their 3-1 win over Burnley . In Barcelona, it was Rivaldo. In Manchester, it is Rooney. England’s most reliable forward has the No 9 and No 10 roles inside him. Yet he is cleaning up at the back, defusing attacks rather than starting them, showing versatility, doing as he is told. He has not had a single shot on target in the Premier League in 2015 after six matches and 450 minutes of football. Those 25 goals that separate Rooney from Sir Bobby Charlton’s all-time Manchester United record of 249 seem as far away as ever. When Rivaldo was marooned on the left wing and voiced his desire to play centrally, the man that would go on to win the 2002 World Cup was dropped from the first team. If Rooney was to argue his case to be used up front again... he wouldn’t, would he? Wayne Rooney (left) controls the ball under pressure from Burnley's Scott Arfield on Wednesday . Rooney's heat map against Burnley shows that he spent the majority of the game behind the halfway line . Yet for a manager seemingly unafraid to bench big names, he remains hellbent on partnering Van Persie and Falcao. Against Burnley, Falcao made 20 passes, won three duels but lost 11, created two chances, and managed zero shots on or off target. He did, however, assist Chris Smalling. Van Persie, meanwhile, made 30 passes, created one chance, and had one shot on or off target – from the penalty spot. More than £500,000 on wages that week, and a single shot between them. Paul Scholes may be ‘struggling to watch’ a joyless Manchester United, but all is not lost. They have been beaten just once in 18 games, and Champions League qualification remains within reach. Yet this is football. The ends must justify the means. Finish in the top four, and all is forgiven. Miss out, and Van Gaal can expect just as many of those uncomfortable questions as his first stint in Barcelona. Falcao has not been living up to his reputation for United since joining on loan from Monaco . Van Gaal remains hellbent on partnering Robin van Persie (left) and Falcao (right) up front . When a colleague of mine is saying this kind of thing then, yeah, you have to see the data and you have to put the data in the right context I believe. I think the media is also coming to the match and you have a lot of opinion about me, or the game, or the players and now you say that you have no opinion. When you have 0 per cent ball possession do you think that you can do that with long balls? Yeah, long balls, in the width, to switch the play. You have to look at the data and then you will see that we did play long balls, but long balls wide, rather than to the striker.  A ball to the forward striker is mainly caused by long-ball play. Because I expected this question, I have made an interpretation of the data for this game and then I have to say that it is not a good interpretation from Big Sam. It is not so difficult also to read that. I am sorry, but we are playing ball possession play and after 70 minutes we did not succeed, in spite of many chances in the second half, then I changed my playing style. Then, of course, with the quality of Fellaini we played more forward balls and we scored from that, so I think it was a very good decision of the manager. But, when you see overall the long ball, and what is the percentage of that, then West Ham have played 71 per cent of the long balls to the forwards and we 49. So, I give you this and you can see that the blue ones are the good ones because long balls are also very difficult, which is why I began with the explanation of ball possession. When you have 60 per cent ball possession you cannot play long balls. So again, they did it 71 and we 49, and I give it you, you can copy it and then maybe you can go to Big Sam and he will get a good interpretation.","Louis van Gaal had his moments with the Barcelona press during his first stint between 1997 and 2000 - even slapping a television camera once .

To your left is Radamel Falcao – a man who earns £280,000 per week, or £40,000 a day, while you earn pennies by comparison. Cambridge United were in that very situation a little over a week ago, when a Manchester United XI – total cost, £276million – drew 0-0 with their League Two counterparts – total cost, zilch. Radamel Falcao walks out for Manchester United in their FA Cup tie with Cambridge at the Abbey Stadium . As in so many matches this season, Falcao was ineffective as United were held 0-0 by the League Two side . Signed on: September 1 . Wages per week: £280,000 . Wages per day: £40,000 . Goals in all competitions: 3 . Pay per goal as of January 29: £2million . Yet forget that FA Cup hiccup because this week marks an anniversary, and sometimes that calls for celebration. Jorge Mendes can only have been tempted to use the good China on Thursday, when his client, Falcao, passed 150 days at Old Trafford. The milestone for the man with three Barclays Premier League goals marks the day his wages hit a cool £6m since moving to Manchester from Monaco. Tax aside. Bonuses not included. It was on August 31 when Falcao was photographed peeking out of the window of a private jet. No stop off in Madrid or London, despite apparent interest from Carlo Ancelotti and Jose Mourinho. The moment Falcao touched down in a private jet to sign for Manchester United on deadline day last summer . Louis van Gaal got him. A club desperate to become European heavyweights once more added the world-renowned striker named after Paulo Roberto Falcao – the Brazilian that starred for the greatest side not to win the 1982 World Cup. In a £6m season-long swoop plus wages they nabbed the natural-born killer from 12 yards or less, coached in the art of terrorising defenders by one himself: his father, Radamel Garcia. It was Falcao's father who arranged his first contract – £50 per week – before his debut on August 28, 1999, in the Colombian second division for Lanceros Boyaca at the age of 13 years, 199 days. Fast forward 15 years and it was Mendes, the most powerful agent in football, who orchestrated his latest contract – leaving behind a club that average less than 15,000 fans at Stade Louis II. Falcao poses with the Monaco No 9 shirt after joining the Ligue 1 side from Atletico Madrid in 2013 . Falcao score 13 goals in 22 appearances for Monaco over two injury-affected seasons . How Falcao scored his last goal against Stoke City . Yet his move from Monaco to Manchester has not matched expectations. Not by a long shot. Not enough to warrant the Glazer family spending £2m per goal, nor enough to feel obligated to relinquish £43m to make his loan arrangement permanent. Falcao has not scored or provided an assist since New Year's Day against Stoke City. Between then and now, he's faced Yeovil Town (60 minutes), Queens Park Rangers (90) and Cambridge (90). Against QPR, to his credit, Falcao's positioning was second to none. Yet every chance – the point-blank header from five yards out, for example – was squandered. One miss in particular was ridiculed, mainly because it was captured from an unkind angle where you could not see Steven Caulker get his studs to it beforehand. Twitter reacted to the air shot appropriately: 'Even Fernando Torres...' You can guess the rest. Manchester United created more chances (16) against QPR than any other team  this year. The closest after that being against Crystal Palace, Chelsea and Aston Villa (all 15). Had it not been for Rob Green, Falcao would have his fourth, perhaps fifth or even sixth goal in all competitions. The pesky QPR goalkeeper was seemingly hell-bent on not allowing him relief. Falcao fails to make contact with the ball as he passes up a sitter of a chance in United's match with QPR . The missed chance at Loftus Road has been one of a number of moments of disappointment this season . Falcao's heat map from United's 2-0 win at Queens Park Rangers a fortnight ago . And so to Cambridge, where Falcao managed 24 touches and one shot on target against a team loitering some 76 places below them in the Football League basement. The appropriately-named Richard Money, meanwhile, is rubbing his hands. His club are prepared for a £1.7m windfall in their return trip to Old Trafford on February 3, a smidgen more than their annual income of £1.6m. Bang for the buck, indeed. All this frustrates Mendes, who accordingly stuck his nose in. The not-so-average Mr 10 Percent took aim at his client's new manager, insisting Falcao would be better off under the guidance of Manchester United's previous leader. No, not David Moyes. 'I would have liked it if Falcao was with Sir Alex Ferguson,' he told La Sexta last week. 'He is a player who needs to play 90 minutes and I don't understand [why he isn't].' Falcao pictured with his agent Jorge Mendes, who has leapt to his defence in recent weeks . Minutes: 90 . Goals: 0 . Assists: 0 . Shots: 3 . Shots on target: 3 . Total passes: 33 . Accurate passes: 22 (66.7%) Duels: 17 . Duel success: 58.8% . Offsides: 1 . Minutes: 90 . Goals: 0 . Assists: 0 . Shots: 3 . Shots on target: 1 . Total passes: 18 . Accurate passes: 18 (100%) Duels: 9 . Duel success: 33.3% . Offsides: 1 . Be careful what you wish for, Jorge. Falcao's 90 minutes apiece against QPR and Cambridge saw six shots, four on target, 40 accurate passes, two offside calls, no goals and no assists. All this, shown above. This doesn't fit the reputation of a man voted for by Cristiano Ronaldo to win the 2013 Ballon d'Or. No petty, political, Eurovision voting by the Madridista that year, it seems. Is it a lack of service?  An injury hangover? Louis van Gaal's formation? Plain, old rotten luck? Well, against QPR, Falcao (No 9) played a supporting role behind Angel di Maria (No 7), as the average positions below demonstrate. A conundrum in itself. Against Cambridge, he averaged a role further up the pitch, more central, slightly ahead of Di Maria. Next up, Leicester City, the club bottom of the Premier League, and minnows Cambridge – both at Old Trafford. Score against them, and what were we worried about? Fail, and uh oh. Falcao (No 9) among Manchester United's average positions against QPR (left) and Cambridge (right) When Falcao signed in the early hours of September 1, the headlines wrote themselves. Take, for example, The Daily Telegraph's 'Striking it rich', Daily Star's '£350,000 a week', or Daily Mail's 'Wow Falcao'. That buzz, however, has left. The hype, barely existent. Patience wearing thin. This was always a gamble. They hired a man that suffered anterior cruciate damage in January – an injury which stole the 2014 World Cup and eight months from him. It was the third severe knee injury of his career. Falcao, still to this day, is understood to  ice the delicate area following every training session. A rumour strengthened when he uploaded a photo to Instagram, inadvertently showing what looked to be an ice pack strapped to his left knee. There are still concerns about Falcao's knee, which caused him to miss the World Cup last year . United must make a decision on whether or not to sign the Colombian striker on a permanent basis . Not so reassuring, either, is Falcao's diminishing records at Manchester United when compared to Monaco and Atletico Madrid. His shot conversion rate (15 per cent) is the 64th best in the Premier League. It is by far his lowest at every club he's been with since 2011, as the table below shows. His average shots per game (1.5) is down, a far cry from his record with Atletico in 2011/12 (3.2) and 2012/13 (2.9). Yet not all is lost. His shooting accuracy (70 per cent) is better than ever, and he now has as many assists (3) as he has managed in any season since 2011. Falcao greets Lionel Messi at the Ballon d'Or awards ceremony in Zurich back in 2012 . Perhaps this is a storm in a teacup, then. Maybe his so-called 'adjustment period' is just longer than others. But Louis van Gaal is losing patience, no matter what he says. Dropping a man being paid £280,000 per week against Southampton – your Champions League qualification rivals – hardly screams faith. A goal against Leicester or Cambridge would be a start because, so far, there's no value for money to be had here. And if it persists, Manchester United would be better washing their hands of Falcao.","Radamel Falcao has scored just three goals since arriving at Old Trafford .

"Does di Maria want to be here? When Angel di Maria arrived at Man United, we all thought: ‘Wow, what an addition to the Premier League!’ Now he looks like he’s not interested. At the start of the season, di Maria was gliding across the field, but at the moment he looks weak and sluggish. We all know what he is capable of and the United fans deserve better. Angel di Maria (right) struggled to make an impact at Swansea, seen up against midfielder Gylfi Sigurdsson . It doesn’t help when your manager over-complicates things, but Di Maria has been nowhere near good enough for a player who cost so much. His form has dipped dramatically, as our table shows, and if he doesn’t improve there will be some serious stick coming his way. There is not a player in the world who doesn’t go through a bad patch but we all want to see more from him. I certainly hope his dip doesn’t suggest he will be angling for pastures new in the summer. Arsenal striker Olivier Giroud celebrates having scored the Gunner's second at Selhurst Park on Saturday . Giroud hits 50 . A lot of people, myself included, have been critical of Olivier Giroud in the past. There has always been too much focus on what he can’t do rather than what he can. But now he is an absolutely key man for Arsenal. He’s not your typical Gunners player. He’s big, strong and likes to play through the middle, but his role at the top of the team lets the rest of the creative dynamos buzz around him. He scores headers, which is a different weapon for Arsenal, and with 50 goals now it’s no wonder Arsene Wenger values him so highly. Tim's tough job . The last thing you want in your first game in charge is to face a Mark Hughes team. It was a hard start for Villa’s Tim Sherwood and I bet even he is surprised by the task he now faces. His appointment was a coup for the club but he has a job on his hands. That squad is too good to go down. Aston Villa manager Tim Sherwood, roars in celebration at Villa Park, has a tough task to keep his side up . City's fab four . Manchester City took Newcastle apart on Saturday. That’s because they finally had their best midfield playing. When David Silva, Yaya Toure, Samir Nasri and Fernandinho start, City win. Unfortunately for them it has only happened three times this season — against Crystal Palace, Sunderland and Newcastle. Injuries and absences mean they have not played often enough but they were a joy to watch. City play off the cuff and with that four they are much more fluid. Using Fernando and Fernandinho is too defensive and with Silva flying and Toure over that poor patch at the start of the season, City looked back to their best. P.S It will be interesting to see if Eliaquim Mangala or Martin Demichelis gets the nod against Barcelona tomorrow. Mangala (right) has had his problems but he’s a good player. Demichelis was sent off in their tie last year so if Mangala plays, he must be ready for Messi and Co. Eliaquim Mangala (right) in action for Manchester City in their 5-0 win against Newcastle on Saturday evening . It's tight in the Championship . 7 - Darren Bent has scored seven goals in eight games for Derby since his loan move in January. Darren Bent scored yet again for Derby to take them to the top of the Championship. It was a great result for them to come from behind twice against Sheffield Wednesday to win and with Middlesbrough and Bournemouth losing, the race at the top of the Championship will go right to the wire. Derby are my favourites to win it now, but I bet Aston Villa wish Bent was scoring all of these goals for them... Liverpool defender Martin Skrtel rises highest to beat Southampton's Graziano Pelle to the ball on Sunday . Skrtel's a rock . 5 - Liverpool have kept five straight away clean sheets in the League for the first time since 1985. Philippe Coutinho and Raheem Sterling will get the plaudits for their goals at Southampton on Sunday, but Martin Skrtel has been vital for Liverpool in recent weeks. It was brave by Brendan Rodgers to switch to a back three and he has made that system work. It shows you what an intelligent manager he is. But it’s players that make systems, and Skrtel has been a rock. It suits him to sit in the middle with men around him and he sees situations early. We know he’s a brave, combative player but he has shown he is a classy operator too, and he has helped Liverpool get right back in the race for the top four. Their home game against Man City on Sunday will be huge. Skrtel (centre) blocks Maya Yoshida's strike for Southampton during the 2-0 win at St Mary's . Jose launches a charm offensive . It was great to see Jose Mourinho talking on Sky’s Goals on Sunday programme and it made for some fascinating viewing. It was only a few weeks ago that he was refusing to speak to the media at all after Diego Costa’s ban. Jose obviously still feels key decisions are going against his team, so now he is back on the charm offensive to see if that helps. Spurs late show . Spurs got away with one on Sunday. They could have been three or four behind against West Ham but did well to recover late in the game. They have won 16 points from losing positions this season, with most of those coming very late on. That shows great spirit. This week they will need it. A tough return leg against Fiorentina in the Europa League and a Capital One Cup final against Chelsea could make or break their season. It will be a real test for this young squad but they did well to make sure they didn’t start it off with a disappointing home defeat. Harry Kane scored with the last kick of the game as Tottenham fought back to draw with West Ham . Caulker's taken a backwards step . I’m not sure what’s happened to Steven Caulker. It’s been more than two years since he scored on his England debut and back then he looked like one of the country’s brightest youngsters. He was poor in the build-up for Hull’s goals on Saturday. Now he needs to do better and start learning quickly. Jamie's Premier League number crunching . 4 - Branislav Ivanovic has been prolific for Chelsea recently. The powerful right back (right) has scored four goals in his last six games. He struck against Liverpool in the Capital One Cup, Aston Villa and Burnley in the League and Paris Saint-Germain in the Champions League. Loic Remy, Eden Hazard and Willian are the only other players to have scored in that period, with one each. 17 - Liverpool have been the Premier League’s form side in 2015. They have won 17 out of a possible 21 points, winning five and drawing two games. 9 - Romelu Lukaku had nine shots at goal without scoring against Leicester, joint-most in a PL game this season. Graziano Pelle matched that tally against Stoke. 560 - It has not been a good start to 2015 for Manchester United or Wayne Rooney. The United captain finally struck his first shot on target of the year in the Premier League at Swansea. It took him 560 minutes to do so. Joey Barton's red card was the ninth dismissal he has received over the course of a controversial career . 3 - Joey Barton has only played for three full seasons at QPR, but he has already been sent off three times for them — more than any other player in the club’s Premier League history. 100 - Brad Guzan started his 100th consecutive PL game on Saturday. The Aston Villa goalkeeper is the first to do so since Stoke’s Jon Walters in October 2013. 15 - Cheikhou Kouyate’S header at White Hart Lane was West Ham’s 15th headed goal of the season. That’s already more than any side managed last season. In 2013-14, Liverpool scored the most headers with 14.","Club record signing Angel di Maria has not scored in 2015 for United .

"Martin 'Mad Dog' Allen returns with the latest instalment of his column for Sportsmail. The Barnet boss recalls watching Phil Parkinson play for Reading and praises the Bradford manager's achievements at the League One Club. PARKY’S MOUTH GUARD . I used to love watching my hometown team Reading, stood on the South Bank at their old Elm Park ground led by the their captain, Phil Parkinson. Parkinson, the northerner, was the first player I’d ever seen wear a mouth guard like a Rugby League player. He was fit as a butcher’s dog, a fearless tough tackler, smashing anybody in his way. Reading's Phil Parkinson (left) closes in on Mark Crisp of Cheltenham in the FA Cup third round in 1998 . Parkison led Bradford to fourth-round FA Cup success against Chelsea at Stamford Bridge in January . Stood on the terraces, as a Reading supporter, he was my hero. Now in the technical area, he is writing his name into the history books at Bradford City football club. Parky has moved and changed with the times. Introducing top technical players like Filipe Morais and Billy Knott, both former Chelsea players, to a team who have used their centre-forward big-boy James Hanson to feed off the second balls and knock-downs. Parkinson, who is now managing Bradford City, takes a strike at goal during the FA Cup tie . Players who have struggled in the lower divisions, now passing through midfield, they have high attacking full backs and with their team spirit, tenacity and desire, Chelsea could not cope in the FA Cup. Parkinson is another example of the good English managers out there – just like Karl Robinson at MK Dons and Paul Cook at Chesterfield. It can only be a matter of time before their qualities are recognised and top clubs will be fishing. Why oh why do club owners keep going abroad and forgetting the good English managers and coaches who are out there? CAREFUL WHAT YOU WISH FOR . All those Newcastle United fans moaning about Alan Pardew, who weren’t keen on him, have now seen from afar four victories for Crystal Palace and just one win for their own team under John Carver. As a manager, if you lose your best players, it isn’t rocket science to work out you lose games. That happened time and again for Pardew. The season before last they lost Yohan Cabaye to Paris Saint-Germain midway through the campaign, their best player by a mile, and their season was over. Then Loic Remy left that summer to Chelsea. Alan Pardew has enjoyed a great start at Crystal Palace after quitting Newcastle in December . Countless times at Newcastle he was forced to part company with his top players and try to find new ones. But that didn’t stop the fans getting on his back. Newcastle supporters might find they regret getting their wish of getting rid of Pardew. It happens throughout the leagues. I heard a couple of weeks ago that Steven Pressley, the manager at Coventry City, is getting moaned at and shouted at by the supporters because the team isn’t winning. Newcastle picked up their first victory under John Carver on Saturday with a 3-0 win against Hull . He is a top-quality manager. He gets his team to get the ball down and play. On top of that he is a humble, down-to-earth man with his feet firmly on the ground. Like Pardew, Pressley has had his best players sold on but still done a fantastic job. Coventry supporters beware, you don’t know how lucky you are. WE’LL KEEP DEFYING THE CRITICS . Here at Barnet we have decided not to strengthen in the January transfer window. Instead, we chose to reinforce all the positive messages and values that we put in place during pre-season. Reminders of respecting each of your team-mates, respecting the staff, respecting the referees and their decisions and an ongoing focus to improve technically, individually and tactically as a team. Barnet manager Martin Allen has decided not to strengthen his squad in January . I only have one full-time member of staff at Barnet, our young physio Jade Cook (she’s also our kit woman) who stepped up from the youth team. She’s only 23. Two senior players, Graham Stack and John Nurse, help me with the warm-ups and together with our minted part-time analyst-cum-scout Omar Yabroudi (he’s also our kit man) we have built up a very strong unit with just 18 players in our squad. They are humble, focused and we have tried our best to do things the right way on and off the field. With 14 games to go, it’s very exciting times and the predictions from all the experts that we would be challenging for only the play-offs at the time probably seemed about right. It’s been remarkable, and I still think there is so much more to come. PLAYER I KEEP HEARING ABOUT... CALLUM WILSON . Two seasons ago, I saw Coventry play and they had a fantastic centre forward called Callum Wilson. I left Northampton’s Sixfields Stadium one Sunday afternoon with his name in my little book marked as one for the future. He was quick, a good athlete and a constant threat to the opposition. He was dangerous. Bournemouth striker Callum Wilson is on the verge of reaching the Premier League . He was only around 20 or 21 at the time but knocked in 22 goals playing in League One last season. Wilson moved to Bournemouth last summer for £3million – money Coventry badly needed – and has not stopped scoring in the Championship. He is now on the verge of the Premier League with them. ONE THING I'D CHANGE ABOUT... THE SUBSTITUTES RULE . There are seven subs allowed in the dugout on the side of the pitch for each game and it’s about time more of them are allowed to enter the field of play. If the players you have aren’t doing it on the pitch, we as managers should be able to change them. It could bring a whole new tactical element to the game with managers able to change more than half of their team at half-time. Bring it on, let’s bring them on! BIG ISSUE... CALMING DOWN DIEGO COSTA . Diego Costa is the perfect fit playing in Jose Mourinho’s team. He likes one up front with three attacking midfield players behind, all technically excellent. Costa is good in the air, mobile, brave and mentally fearless. He leads the line and leads the team. However, I’m sure, on the quiet, despite backing his man vehemently in public, Mr Mourinho would be having a quiet chat, privately and discreetly, to try to tame his tiger. Allen says Jose Mourinho will have had a quiet word with Diego Costa after he was banned for three games . Mr Mourinho will be very happy with his will to win and desire, even though he has clearly over-stepped the mark a few times. It’s a fine line but Mourinho is the master of man-management. It’s why I think Costa was the best piece of business done last summer.","Phil Parkinson should be on the radar of the top clubs .

"If you were feeling lucky pre-season, then you may have waltzed into your local bookmakers, seen Southampton priced at 6/1 to be relegated, and thought: 'Why not?' They'd just been stripped of Luke Shaw, Adam Lallana, Dejan Lovren, Calum Chambers and Rickie Lambert. Nicola Cortese, their chairman, had resigned. Their manager, Mauricio Pochettino, had abandoned St Mary's in favour of a more likely European candidate in north London. Yet your ill-wagered stake has been lost. For Southampton have passed the 40-point mark – the yardstick for Barclays Premier League survival – with 16 games to spare. Eljero Elia celebrates with his manager Ronald Koeman during Southampton's win at Newcastle . Elia (left) ran straight to Southampton manager Koeman to share in the moment of his first goal for the club . Southampton have defied the odds this season to remain in contention for a top-four finish . Jose Fonte (left) faced Tranmere four years ago . Four years ago, Southampton lost 2-0 against Tranmere Rovers in League One at Prenton Park... with Rickie Lambert, Jose Fonte (pictured), Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and Morgan Schneiderlin involved . The Champions League beckons, and it is hardly a case of your awkward cousin crashing the party. They’ve earned their invite to be among the pack chasing European football. Queens Park Rangers, from 2007, were the focal point of a documentary by Mat Hodgson called The Four Year Plan. The plot was to chronicle the debt-ridden club’s leap from the Championship to the Premier League, from Bovril to Champagne. The west Londoners did it, under the tutelage of Formula One magnates Flavio Briatore and Bernie Ecclestone, and fellow tycoons Alejandro Agag, Lakshmi Mittal and Amit Bhatia. Southampton may not have had a fly on the wall but they’ve done it, too. This weekend marks four years since Southampton, scrapping in League One, lost 2-0 against Tranmere Rovers, the Merseyside club now loitering some 88 positions below in the basement division. A certain Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, Rickie Lambert, Jose Fonte and Morgan Schneiderlin played that day on January 22 to the tune of a 5,504 attendance. Fonte is used to marking those such as Arsenal's Olivier Giroud these days in the Premier League . Morgan Schneiderlin (top) has gone from facing Tranmere in 2011 to Manchester United and Co in 2015 . Southampton, Ronald Koeman . Manchester United, Louis van Gaal . Arsenal, Arsene Wenger . Tottenham Hotspur, Mauricio Pochettino . West Ham, Sam Allardyce . Liverpool, Brendan Rodgers . The latter two remain at Southampton, while Tranmere face dropping out of the Football League altogether this year. There's something sentimental about going from Tranmere’s Prenton Park and the like to knocking on the door of Real Madrid’s Bernabeu, Barcelona’s Nou Camp, and Bayern Munich’s Allianz Arena, among others. What football supporter hasn’t dreamed of that? Liverpool, following a five-year absence from the Champions League, were cordially invited to the Bernabeu in Group B on November 4, yet fielded a weakened team. Were Southampton given the chance... you know the rest. Yet 16 games are to be played between now and May 24, when they travel to the Etihad to play reigning champions Manchester City. That finale perhaps the ultimate test of their Champions League credentials. Liverpool fielded a weakened side against Real Madrid at the Bernabeu this season... would Southampton? Brendan Rodgers' men got back into the Champions League after a five-year absence but fielded a B team . It is 10 years since Everton reached the Champions League only to lose in the qualifying rounds . The Premier League, you see, is a tight-knit group. Its status quo is rarely interrupted, as shown above. In the past five years just six different teams have broken into the top four – those being Chelsea, Arsenal, Tottenham Hotspur, Liverpool and the two Manchester clubs. Everton are the seventh club, if you stretch back a decade, though they lost in the qualifying rounds. Compare that to Europe’s top divisions since 2009 – Spain’s La Liga (9), Germany’s Bundesliga (7), France’s Ligue 1 (9) and Italy’s Serie A (9) – and the Premier League (6) proves the most difficult to crack. All this, shown below. Atletico Madrid stunned Europe by reaching the Champions League final in Lisbon last season . Atletico also beat giants Barcelona and Real Madrid to the La Liga crown in an extraordinary season . Southampton, it is well documented, traded their prized possessions for £94.5million during the summer’s transfer window. They made a mockery of the suggestion they would not cope without Shaw, Lallana, Lovren, Chambers, Lambert (and Cortese and Pochettino). To think it was on December 20, 2014, when Southampton had Everton, Crystal Palace, Chelsea, Arsenal, Manchester United and Newcastle ahead. It was the run that should unmask the pretenders, that would surely end all this silly nonsense. Southampton took no notice. They have taken 16 points since beating Everton 3-0, the finest form in the Premier League. Liverpool – the club that exchanged £49m for Lovren, Lallana and Lambert – are behind with 14 points from their previous six. Then, Arsenal, Chelsea and Tottenham (13). Southampton – WWDWWW (16 points) Liverpool – DWWDWW (14) Arsenal – DWWLWW (13) Chelsea – WWDLWW (13) Tottenham Hotspur – WWDWLW (13) Manchester City – WWDWDL (11) Stoke City – LWWDLW (10) Manchester United – DWDDLW (9) Nathaniel Clyne has been an integral part of Southampton's watertight defence this season . Elia (left) gave Southampton the lead against Newcastle as they continue their quest for European football . Dec 20, Southampton 3-0 Everton . Dec 26, Crystal Palace 1-3 Southampton . Dec 28, Southampton 1-1 Chelsea . Jan 1, Southampton 2-0 Arsenal . Jan 11, Man Utd 0-1 Southampton . Jan 17, Newcastle 1-2 Southampton . Feb 1, Southampton vs Swansea City . Feb 7, QPR vs Southampton . Feb 11, Southampton vs West Ham . Feb 22, Southampton vs Liverpool . Feb 28, West Brom vs Southampton . Mar 3, Southampton vs Crystal Palace . Given their fixtures since before Christmas, you can only ask a) how many points did Southampton expect to get from those six matches? And b) how many points do they expect to get from their next six? Swansea City, QPR, West Ham, Liverpool, West Bromwich Albion and Crystal Palace to come. Maximum 18? Settle for another 16? Fifteen perhaps? Southampton's defence will have a say in that. In the Premier League, they’ve conceded the least goals (16), giving them the best average (0.73), and have made more tackles (512) than any other club. At the other end, they’ve scored the fourth most goals (37), and have had the fifth most shots (220), not including those blocked. Their percentage of goals to shots (16.82) is the third best in the Premier League. Southampton pulled off a stunning 1-0 victory at Old Trafford earlier this month to shock Manchester United . United have struggled under Dutchman Louis van Gaal, unlike Southampton under countryman Koeman . Van Gaal (left) and Koeman (right) went head to head but the Southampton manager won in the away fixture . Did you hear the one about the Dutchmen? No, not a joke. It is Ronald Koeman and Louis van Gaal, the Southampton and Manchester United managers respectively, that occupy the coveted third and fourth positions. They are far from friends, despite being compatriots, yet made headlines for differing reasons during their first month in charge, namely because one brought in £94.5m while the other spent £153m. Van Gaal has been questioned about his formations, tactics, substitutions, and the like. Why, for example, was Phil Jones taking corners? Why was Angel di Maria being used as a striker? Why will you not give up on 3-5-2? He’s playing all the right notes, just not necessarily in the right order – as the late, great Eric Morecambe might say. Southampton are aiming to qualify for the Champions League this year in the Premier League . Koeman replaced Mauricio Pochettino last summer and has taken the club to new heights . Koeman, on the other hand, has cracked it. He orchestrated a win over Manchester United at Old Trafford. Then, another over Newcastle at St James’ Park, and had the gall to suggest the three points in the North East felt even sweeter. There are no delusions of grandeur. While we’d all love to see Sam Allardyce, trench coat et al, command West Ham at the Bernabeu, it would be stirring to see a team that just four years ago were in League One earn their right to be in Europe next year. The Four Year Plan, indeed. It would prove Champions League qualification in England is not reserved for those prepared to break the bank. Not just a rich boys club, after all. We’ll know for certain come May 24. If Southampton can continue their unprecedented rise, then they could be coming to a Champions League evening near you. Here’s hoping.

"Martin 'Mad Dog' Allen returns with the latest instalment of his column for MailOnline Sport. The Barnet boss does not hold back with his views on current issues in football and this week reflects on how much of a 'proper bloke' he thinks Stoke City's Steve Sidwell is and how impressed he was with the atmosphere when his Barnet side visited Bristol Rovers' Memorial Stadium last week. BIG TIME CHARLIES . How refreshing it was when I visited White Hart Lane, having sat with the prawn sandwich brigade in a private box, to bump into Stoke City midfielder Steve Sidwell. He is not short of money, played for endless Premier League clubs and had just had a good win at Tottenham Hotspur. We walked towards each other in a corridor of the stadium, him with his Stoke City tracksuit on, and he said, 'Well done at Barnet. I see you're six points clear.' Martin Allen met Stoke City's tough-tackling Steve Sidwell (left) at White Hart Lane last month . Allen thought that Sidwell was a 'proper, humble bloke' after having sat with the prawn sandwich brigade . I thought what a proper bloke and a proper man he was. The majority of top players earning fortunes are big-time and forget their roots. Sidwell is humble, hard-working and a decent person. It only seems like yesterday I saw him play for Arsenal reserves at Barnet's old Underhill ground on a Tuesday night against Southampton. I remember he got a yellow card for a crunching tackle on a young Saints midfield player. Sidwell stood out from the rest of that Arsenal team, not only for his ginger hair but for his tenacious tackling which set him aside from all the nice footballers in the Gunners side. He is a top professional. Sidwell stood out from the rest of the Arsenal team when he played for their reserves at Barnet . MITCH IS MAKING MOVES AT SPURS . I gave Paul Mitchell, who has just been appointed Tottenham's head of recruitment, his first job after his playing career was so cruelly ended. Mitch is old school, from up north, who tells it as it is. He was a tough-tackling midfielder and I'm sure over the next couple of years they will recruit players to put more steel through the spine of Spurs' team. Mitch was a player of mine at MK Dons. He was an old-fashioned central midfield player, a steady up-and-downer. But one Saturday afternoon, 10 yards in front of me in the dugout, he was involved in a horror tackle and was rushed to hospital. Paul Mitchell has been appointed as Tottenham Hotspur's new head of recruitment . That night, I arrived at the hospital and the orthopaedic consultant called me in, pulled the curtain and told me the injury that Mitch had received was similar to the impact of a car crash. His ankle where it met his shin bones was mashed up and he told me there and then that he wouldn't play again. Round the corner was his mum and dad and his lovely wife. His contract was up at the end of the season and they were yet to hear the news. We decided not to tell him and not to tell them and Pete Winkelman, the MK Dons chairman, promised me that we would give Mitch another year on his contract to help him recover. Within that time through his rehab and recovery he would start work doing opposition analysis, which turned out to be his pathway forward as he couldn't play again. Allen managed Mitchell at Milton Keynes Dons before the player suffered a career-ending injury . Mitchell (left) tackles Simeon Bambrook of Farsley Celtic during an FA Cup game for MK Dons in 2006 . RAMBUNCTIOUS ROVERS SUPPORTERS . I've been lucky enough to visit a few Premier League games over the past six months, but very few can match the atmosphere and passion of Bristol Rovers supporters when we visited the Memorial Stadium on Tuesday last week. In what was biblical rain, seven-and-a-half thousand turned up and sung their hearts out saluting every tackle, challenge and refereeing decision like it was a Champions League final, FA Cup final and Premier League title decider rolled into one. After relegation out of the Football League on the final day of last season, they could've turned their backs, but it looks like it's made them even stronger. Allen was extremely impressed by the support and atmosphere at Bristol Rovers' Memorial Stadium . ALLEN'S ANALYSIS . Player I keep hearing about... Harry Beautyman. I've been watching an attacking-midfield player for three years since I went to see Sutton United against Basingstoke to scout them ahead of my Notts County side meeting them in the FA Cup. I picked out a boy that night who was skinny but energetic, athletic and enthusiastic for the game. He caught my eye back then and recently he played against us for Welling United and once again attracted my attention. He was such a danger in the final third and I put him on my list to get next summer. Then that crafty Barry Fry goes and signs him for Peterborough United on loan last week. Keep an eye out for Harry Beautyman. Harry Beautyman signed for Peterborough United on loan last week and is a player to watch, says Allen . One thing I'd change about... The reputation of lower league football... People say lower-level football is fading, but I don't agree. We're still in touch with supporters, it's more affordable for the general paying public and the old adage that is kick-and-rush is a complete load of b******. There are good coaches, good managers and the Vanarama Conference is a great league to be involved in. Allen does not believe lower-level football is fading - he thinks the supporters are still enjoying it . THE BIG ISSUE . Having watched Tottenham against Stoke, many of the Spurs supporters were saying that Mauricio Pochettino is not the answer and they need a new manager. Gordon Bennett, I thought, he's taken over and inherited players who lack character and guts. The spine of the team is like weak orange squash. There's no tenacity, very little fire, and nothing for the Tottenham supporters to shout about. Yeah it's lovely being able to kick the ball with your leg going round the back of your other leg, whatever move they call it, but playing 40 games up and down the country week-in and week-out, tracking full backs, competing man-for-man, and the supporters and owners must be shaking their head at the shocking recruitment. It's no wonder Paul Mitchell has been brought in from Southampton. Mauricio Pochettino has been getting a hard ride at Tottenham but it is not all his fault . Allen believes Pochettino has inherited a squad who 'lack character and guts', like 'weak orange squash'","Martin Allen was in a private box for Tottenham Hotspur against Stoke City .

"Martin 'Mad Dog' Allen returns with the latest installment of his column for MailOnline Sport. The Barnet boss does not hold back with his views on current issues in football and this week reflects on some of the mad happenings during pre-season at The Hive. FROM SERIE A TO THE CONFERENCE . We've had a 21-year-old Italian lad called Gianluca Rubin training with us who has been captain of Juventus's Under 20s. A few years ago, there is no way any Italian would've even heard of the Conference, let alone come on trial for a contract. He paid for his own flight and accommodation and is looking for an English club after being released by Juventus. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Huddersfield sack Robins after first game . He's back! Mad Dog Martin Allen is raring to go as the new season gets started . Last Tuesday, he played in the centre of defence in a reserve game for us alongside an 18-year-old called Gater – his name's Joe, but I like to call him Ali. They are two young lads from very different football backgrounds. Gianluca from Serie A champions who were regularly playing in the Champions League. And Gater who we got from Aldershot when they stopped their youth policy for financial reasons. Well, Gianluca is a good player and very good technically, but unfortunately I don't think he will cut it as a 5ft 9ins centre-back in an away game against Halifax on a Tuesday night. But Gater is a maniac. He heads it and boots it and is a fearless warrior. Contrast: The Hive is rather different to the Juventus Arena, as young trialist Gianluca Rubin has found out . DRILLING FOR... WATER . It was like a scene from Dallas at our Hive training ground last month. We've had drilling and pumping going on – not for oil, but for water to get the sprinklers on. Our training pitches were getting dry and becoming difficult to work on for the players. It can cause injuries. So the chairman found a company who brought in a huge drill and set up a tent around it to dig down to some water pipes. Lo-and-behold, within two minutes of the drill striking H2O, it started to rain. Marvellous. Striking for water? It's been like an episode of Dallas at The Hive during pre-season . OFF TO A FLYER . There was definitely something in the water on Saturday – what a result my Barnet side beating Chester 5-0 in the first game of the Conference season. I went in to see the chairman after the game and he hugged me but was shaking his head. I asked him what was wrong. 'I missed the first three goals, Martin,' he said. He told me he'd only arrived in Chester 10 minutes into the second half due to the traffic on the M6 where there was an accident. 'I saw the fourth goal then the stadium announcer asked for the driver of a black BMW to move their car because it was blocking someone in.' 'Martin,' he added,' I missed the fifth goal as I was moving my car! The biggest away victory in all my time as Barnet chairman and I've only seen one goal. I can't believe it.' WADDOCK 101 . Since Gary Waddock left Oxford last month he has been our VIP guest down at Barnet for quite a few days. Managers get sacked and forgotten and the phone doesn't ring. It can be very lonely, worrying and the self-esteem can drop to the floor. Self-doubt can creep in and you wonder where the next job is coming from. VIP: Allen has been helping out Gary Waddock since he left Oxford United last month . So I got Gary in at our place. He got the sack at Oxford after winning promotions at former clubs Aldershot and Wycombe. At Aldershot, he got a record 101 points to win the Conference title in 2008. Hopefully his days out with us will keep his mood up and it won't be long before my former QPR team-mate returns to football management after his recent shock sacking. Wherever he goes I've got no doubt he will build a promotion-winning team. FALLEN AT THE FIRST HURDLE . One game into the season – and the Premier League hasn't even kicked off yet – and we have our first man down in the managerial sack race. Mark Robins paid the price for Huddersfield losing 4-0 at home to Bournemouth. That is an awful feeling in front of your own fans and it leaves you demoralised. However, their opponents Bournemouth finished last season very well and will be close to joining the top flight at the end of the season. They will spank many teams home and away this season. Which I guess, when he wakes up this morning with no job to go to, will be no consolation to Mark. Gone already: Mark Robins has left Huddersfield Town after just one match of the Championship season . VIDEO Huddersfield sack Robins after first game . HARRY, HARRY, HARRY . As I was driving to work one beautiful sunny morning I saw signs warning of traffic because of a Hare Krishna festival. It reminded me of an old Boy George track. Believe it or not he was one of my favourites. The last track on one of his CDs is called Bow Down Mister which is about Hare Krishnas. All the way through, he sings: 'Harry, Harry, Harry' - well, that's what it sounds like. Seeing the funny side: Harry Redknapp enjoyed Boy George's singing of his name . One year at West Ham, we'd just lost away and were on the coach back. Our manager Harry Redknapp wasn't too happy. He was sat on the front seat, so I gave the driver the CD and asked him to play track 20 and turn the volume up all the way. I hid in the back corner of the bus as Boy George rattled out the chorus 'Harry, Harry, Harry.' We were all in fits of laughter as Harry turned around and grinned. ALLEN'S ANALYSIS . The player I keep hearing about... Newcastle United have got a great deal for Jamaal Lascelles. When I saw Nottingham Forest play at Reading's Madejski Stadium on New Year's Day I made a note of a young centre-back. He was quick, could pass well and was composed on the ball. He played with an elegance about him. In the last minute of the game, the score tied at 1-1, Reading had a free kick. They piled everyone into the box for the 40-yard up-and-under into the mixer. Lascelles was there surrounded by bustling Reading centre forwards, their tall centre-backs and the big units of the team. New club: Talented defender Jamaal Lascelles has moved to Newcastle United from Nottingham Forest . Great business: Alan Pardew has brought in Lascelles (left) and goalkeeper Karl Darlow (right) from Forest though the pair are set to remain at the City Ground on loan for the season ahead . As the ball floated in the lad – under pressure from five of them – ignored the carnage, leapt into the air and headed it 30 yards from the goal. I circled his name and knew he would be one to sign. Since then he's one people keep talking about. It's another great bit of business by Alan Pardew. One thing I'd change about.... Substitutes. With seven subs now sitting on the bench, changes should be made to the rules so that two of those must be homegrown players that have been at the club for at least three years. It's about time changes were made. This would hopefully give more opportunities to promote our young English players coming through. On top of that, I think five subs should be allowed to enter the field of play. Why only restrict it to three, when you've got seven sitting on the bench? It's seems pointless. The big issue... What a nightmare at Blackpool – or is it? My old hometown club Reading were days from going bust towards the end of last season after someone pulled their money out after promises of fortunes being paid into the club. They were in a precarious position and after being so well-run over the years it was a shock for all Reading fans. Testing times: Blackpool are a club in crisis as fans protest against hated owner Karl Oyston . Scratch team: Blackpool manager Jose Riga managed to scramble together a team at the last moment to face Nottingham Forest on Saturday . Well Karl Oyston, the Blackpool owner, runs a club with no debt, and have put a team together without having to pay players in June and July. It's a smart move. Rather than the start of summer when players and agents are demanding ridiculous sums, by getting them so close to the start of the season they can call the shots. The debts at most clubs in the Championship are huge. I can understand why Blackpool supporters were getting angry, but you have to ask yourself, do we want to be another Portsmouth or Hereford?","Barnet boss reflects on another crazy pre-season that has seen trialists from Juventus and scenes akin to Dallas at The Hive .
But the Bees got off to the perfect start, beating Chester 5-0 on opening day... not that the chairman saw it all .
Mark Robins has become the season's first managerial casualty after leaving Huddersfield... after just one match .
Jamaal Lascelles will prove an excellent signing for Alan Pardew at Newcastle United .
And is Blackpool's threadbare squad actually a smart move by the owner?"
"Hearing the Newcastle fans laying into Alan Pardew, I have to laugh. Not because it's funny. It's really hard when you're a manager and you keep reading speculation about your future and hearing things being sung on the terraces. But it reminds me of what happened to me. When I was manager at Leicester City, we played away at Nottingham Forest in a local derby with 25,000 fans on my back. VIDEO Scroll down for Alan Pardew: The tension created by the fans isn't going to go away . Alan Pardew being on thin ice at Newcastle United reminds Mad Dog of his time as Leicester City boss . Newcastle fans are calling for Pardew to be sacked after the club's poor start to the season . We were losing 1-0 when the Forest fans sung as one: 'You're getting sacked in the morning' as I stood in the technical area. The Leicester fans stood there quietly as the volume seemed to go up a level each time the chant, 'You're getting sacked in the morning' went around the stadium. At first I stood there stony-faced. Then I realised they were probably right! I took a deep breath and started to nod in agreement, with a big smile on my face, knowing I was a lame Dog on the way to the sacking graveyard. It can be tough on the touchline. Whether you're at the top or bottom, it's a Mad place to be. Martin Allen likens the vitriol aimed at Alan Pardew to his brief experience in charge of Leicester in 2007 . BIG BONDZ COST ME FIFTY QUID . It was half-time in our away match at Forest Green Rovers and one of our players said: 'We need someone to attack these corners and free kicks.' I pointed to our big strong centre back Bondz N'Gala, who had not scored all season, and told the team if he scores I'll join them at the corner flag to celebrate. My throwaway comment drifted around the room. Bondz N'Gala, who moved from Portsmouth to Barnet in the summer, scored a last-ditch winner for his side against Forest Green and lost Mad Dog £50 . We were one up, but after 88 minutes Forest Green equalised. Then deep into stoppage time, we won a corner. As I sat in the technical area I was thinking this was a good point away from home. Bondz strode forward, looking across and cutting me an evil stare. He got closer and closer to the 18 yard box and the spring in his step was that of a passionate gladiator going in to his final battle. The corner came over and big Bondz leaped seven foot above the 6ft 7in centre back – I might be exaggerating slightly there – to power in an unstoppable Joe Royle-like, Mick Harford-like, Andy Carroll-like header into the back of the net. All the players ran to the corner flag and beckoned me over. The subs were pushing and prodding me to go. But the fourth official, god bless him, saved me a fine of a weeks' wages by pointing his finger and telling me not to do it. The moment was there in front of me. I took a step back, a deep breath, and sat down. When the players came in a minute later, with three points in the bag, our young full back Andy Yiadom looked up as I put a sugar in my coffee and said, 'Gaffer, you bottled it.' It's cost me £50 for the players Christmas party fund, but it saved me a weeks' wages. RYDER CUP TACTICS . Every time it comes around, I try to catch as much Ryder Cup action as I can. I shot off from training early on the Friday, crashed on the sofa with a packet of digestive biscuits and barely missed a shot apart from a few hours on Saturday afternoon winning that match against Forest Green to leave us top of the table. Good old Tom Watson reminded me of a Ronald Reagan-style American ambassador who is popular with everybody. Phil Mickleson was out of order for having a go at him just after they had lost. He spoke of Paul Azinger's management style as having 'pods' of players and seeking opinions of who they would like to play with and if players were not in form or physically needed to be rested. The senior players in the pods would have open communication with Azinger. It was kind of like a pyramid effect. Phil Mickelson (left) was out of order criticising the performance of Ryder Cup captain Tom Watson (right) but the pyramid-like 'pod' system is precisely what Mad Dog uses in his own management style . Well, at Gillingham I worked on exactly the same management style. We had one team captain, four senior players helping me decide training with my two assistants Carl Muggleton and John Schofield helping me make the final decisions. It is the same here now at Barnet where I have two player coaches and five senior players who all contribute to our training, to the work we do, to the game plan, to the physical needs of the players and, most importantly, to keep all our players united and fighting for the cause. ALLEN'S ANALYSIS . The player I keep hearing about... Britt Assombalonga . It's always nice and reassuring when you see players you've highlighted and tried to sign in the past going on and doing very well. Assombalonga, the Nottingham Forest striker who is top scorer in the Championship, was on loan at Southend from Watford when we tried to get him on a season-long loan while I was in charge at Gillingham. Britt Assombalonga, the Championship's top scorer so far, will be a success in the Premier League . He has pace and excellent technical finishing skills and a hunger and appetite. He always plays on the shoulder of the last defender looking to get in behind them. I'm delighted he's gone on and done well, and I'm not surprised at his success so far this season. He's still only 21, and, for me, his progression into the Championship, after playing at Southend, is an all-important stepping stone to what will be a successful career in the Premier League. He will be banging Premier League goals in soon – and maybe for Forest. One thing I'd change about... FOREIGN IMPORTS . After watching England play in the World Cup this summer and having traipsed around South Africa and seen how disastrous those tournaments were, something needs to change. A rule needs to be brought in that only quality overseas players can play in our leagues. It's been flooded with average players at all levels and it's stopping good young English players getting the valuable experience they need. A system should be put in place, so only players who have 10 caps for a national team in the top 10 FIFA rankings, or 20 caps for teams between 10 and 20, or 30 caps for those between 20 and 30, and so on, can join English clubs. We need to sort out our national team. Louis van Gaal's sutocratic style could mean tricky times ahead for Manchester United . The big issue... Louis van Gaal going public that the Manchester United players have been unable to grasp his ideas and trying to blend so many magnificent, talented, egotistical forwards is going to be a true test of his management style. His school teacher background, his straight, upright spine gives the impression of an autocratic leader who believes he is above all criticism. We're all well aware of Sir Alex Ferguson's hairdryer, but on the other side he was a father figure who knew everything about every player from the top to the bottom of Manchester United. Van Gaal completely lacks that understanding side. With their player recruitment and his dictatorial style I think tricky times lie ahead. David Moyes will be sitting watching the results, shaking his head, thinking if he had all that money to spend, where would they be now?","Newcastle boss Alan Pardew's woes remind me of when I was at  Leicester .
It can be tough on the touchline whether you're at the top or bottom .
Bondz N'Gala's winner for Barnet against Forest Green cost me £50 .
Phil Mickelson was out of order in his criticism of Tom Watson, but I use exactly the same pod system with senior players that he supports .

THE GLORIOUS GERMANS . I've been reading through the weeks that Germany are not an outstanding team – just a good team. Many experts have talked them down and I cannot understand it. For me, they are a completely different class – and they proved it on Sunday night by winning the World Cup in extra time against Argentina. On top of the world: Philipp Lahm holds the World Cup trophy aloft after Germany beat Argentina 1-0 . Man of the moment: Germany forward Mario Gotze (centre) celebrates after scoring the winner at The Maracana . They don't have any wing wizards, magical No 10s, or match-winners like Lionel Messi or Cristiano Ronaldo. In Spain this season, Atletico Madrid won the league without the so-called Galacticos and pin-up poster boys, but with a high work ethic, unity, discipline and a willingness to stand man-to-man with the opposition to compete. They excelled with a fierce desire and they played with pace and passion. I guess the experts would say they are a good team, because they don't have the fancy Dans who flick it and tip-tap it around the half-way line. Germany remind me of Atletico Madrid. They are well-drilled, competitive and have pace throughout the team. I love the way they play, I love their attitude. They have no Big Time Charlies. They are like a Mercedes-Benz: oozing quality, good on the eye and they can run all day. For me, they are outstanding. Kiss for the cup: Germany goalkeeper Manuel Neuer kisses the World Cup trophy as his team-mates look on . Party time: Lukas Podolski (bottom) celebrates along with members of the Germany backroom team . RODGERS RECRUITING THE RIGHT WAY . At Tottenham last summer, technical director Franco Baldini was the key man in recruiting and spending the cash they got from Gareth Bale's world record transfer. Most of those players were not Andre Villas-Boas's choice and for a manager, having players bought for you who you don't think are good enough is extremely difficult. The powers that be will constantly question why they're not playing and if you lose, the clamp around you gets tighter and tighter. On the lookout: Tottenham technical director Franco Baldini was the key man in spending the club's cash . The squeeze of pressure grows and the manager starts to feel the heat. Some managers end up playing people they don't think are good enough to satisfy the people upstairs. AVB last season had no chance. The players would've known that he was unhappy; that he was stressed and he was fielding players who were quite clearly not good enough. That's what you can get with a director of football who goes off and buys only the players that he wants. Back for more: Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers (centre) returned to the training pitch last week . Key role: Barry Hunter is Rodgers' chief scout at Liverpool . At Liverpool it is very different. Brendan Rodgers is in complete control. His chief scout and main man for recruiting is Barry Hunter. Barry was a player at Reading and he has an encyclopedic knowledge of players all over the world. Brendan took him from Manchester City and he is a top Dog. They have built up a fantastic network of scouts and Barry collects air miles like I collect Nectar points. These players would've all been analysed, Moneyball-style, and no-one would've been brought in at Anfield without Brendan's approval. It is the only way it can work. At one club I worked at, the chairman had signed five players, four of whom were nowhere near good enough. I nodded and agreed, then didn't play them. Within six weeks I'd got the bullet. SUAREZ OVERSTEPS THE MARK . When I was a boy growing up I loved watching tennis at Wimbledon. In those days the two great players were Bjorn Borg and John McEnroe. Borg always wore Fila gear with his Diadora trainers and McEnroe had on his Sergio Tacchini kit and Nike trainers. This was back when they played with brown wooden rackets. Borg was relaxed, had very few expressions, silent assassin eyes and was calmness personified. Controversy: Luis Suarez was banned from world football for four months after biting Giorgio Chiellini . McEnroe beat himself up if he lost any point. Smashing his racket on the ground, on his head or on anything nearby. Any decision that went the wrong way, the line judge or the umpire got it with both barrels. His eyes were viscous and he was Mr Angry. He never had a good word to say about anybody and I loved him. He was a character, he was different and he was Mad. You cannot be serious: Tennis player John McEnroe was renowned for his tantrums on the court . Luis Suarez fits into that McEnroe bracket. He can display extreme brilliance and magic on the football pitch, but then his mind goes and he does something no-one can believe. I personally feel he overstepped the mark once too often, however brilliant he is, and believe Liverpool have made the right decision to move him on. Incident: Suarez controversially bites Italy's Chiellini during the World Cup match in Brazil last month . VIDEO Suarez will fit in at Barca - Koeman . MY WEEK... I spent my Saturday afternoon basking in the sunshine sat next to the legend Barry Fry as Peterborough United visited Barnet for a pre-season friendly. His energy, enthusiasm and knowledge of the game was quite amazing. He knew every single one of my players; where they came from, their ages, he knew the lot. Then the guy sat in front also started commenting and telling me the ages of our players and where they had been before. Over there: Barnet manager Martin Allen (left) gestures as he stands beside player-coach Graham Stack during the friendly against Peterborough United on Saturday .

"Martin 'Mad Dog' Allen returns with the latest installment of his column for MailOnline Sport. The Barnet boss does not hold back with his views on current issues in football and this week reflects on Manchester United's transfer policy and team building Strachan style. STRACHAN TEAM SPIRIT . I remember a few years ago Gordon Strachan speaking about team bonding. He was of the opinion that a round of golf and 10 rounds of Guinness was supposed to be good for team spirit. He thought that if you were together as a team, trained hard and practiced collectively then on those cold, windy, rainy nights when you travel miles to get to the ground, you'll know you can rely on your team-mates in tough, testing conditions. When you earn that hard-fought 1-0 away win, get back on the bus for that long journey home, you are exhausted but proud. Great Scot! Gordon Strachan had his own methods of team building, which can involve golf and Guiness . Top. Barnet lead the Conference . Well, I thought of that advice from Strachan after our first game of the Conference season away to Chester. Our bus set off from north London at 8am for the three-hour and 42 minute journey. We're having no over-night stops this year at Barnet as all that extra expenditure is going towards paying higher wages. Our bus driver Ricky has the latest device, called a Traffic Finder. In essence, it appears to mean we find traffic wherever it is. Lo and behold there was a serious traffic accident on the M6. We took a diversion, using the Traffic Finder, across country. Ricky said we should be there in half-an-hour. Two hours later, we were stuck on an A road, in single-file traffic, moving at five miles per hour. We finally pulled into Chester's Deva Stadium at 2.27pm. We threw all the match kit in the middle . of the changing room floor, emptied the boots into the shower room and . turned the shinpad box over. The lads grabbed what they could, we warmed . up for only 10 minutes before taking to the field for the three o'clock . kick off. On the road: Getting caught in traffic led to Barnet beating Chester 5-0 in the Conference Premier . By 30 minutes we were 3-0 up and ended up winning by five. On the bus journey home, I reflected that in the face of adversity and a six-and-a-half hour bus ride there, the team spirit was Strachan-esque to perform like we did. It's one of the most extraordinary days I've had in football. KEVIN CAN'T GET ENOUGH . We've had Kevin Blackwell as a guest at training this month. He is an excellent coach and to save him from boredom I got him in with us. Kevin's . energy and enthusiasm rubs off on everybody. He's got good knowledge and . it's been a pleasure having him with all our players. The only problem . I've got, is getting him off the training pitch. He just loves working, . developing and improving our players. Kevin, . who has been out of work since he was sacked by Bury last year, has got . a tremendous record and I find it strange that he is not working at a . very high level. Coach trip: Kevin Blackwell's only problem at Barnet has been getting him off the training pitch . COOKY IS ON FIRE . A week before the season started I had a phone call from a bloke called Lee Cook asking if he could train with us just to get fit, as he had no club. I told him we were no longer having anyone on trial as we were in the key stages of preparing for the season. I wished him luck, and just out of decency I asked Lee who he played for previously. He replied: 'I'm the Lee Cook who got transferred to QPR from Fulham for £2.5million five years ago.' Recipe for success: Former QPR star Lee Cook has earned himself a contract after pitching up to to train . I thought we had got to get him in, so I invited him to training the following day. I warned him that we didn't have any money to pay him. We trained him hard – and in the first session he vomited everywhere. Lee was playing in the Greek Premier League for Apollon Smyrni since January but he didn't have a club. He can hardly run, but he's always got a smile on his face and has a wicked left foot. Well, he earned himself a one-year deal, has already scored a hat-trick and is our top scorer with six goals. Cook has certainly got the recipe for success. ALLEN'S ANALYSIS... The person I keep hearing about this month... Neil Aspin. Halifax Town have had a resurgence under former Leeds United defender Aspin. I have been impressed with his managerial methods. I met him recently and he told me he only recruits players from the lower levels who are hungry for football, rather than those who can't get a club elsewhere and are dropping into the Conference. Remember the name! Leeds United could do worse than take a chance on Halifax boss Neil Aspin (L) Halifax beat Barnet 4-0 at the end of last season – and it could have been 10. Afterwards, I met Neil in my office. As he was shutting the door to leave, he stepped back in and asked if I knew where the nearest supermarket or off-licence was. I told him I didn't have a clue and asked why. He replied that they had no midweek game and winning away from home called for a case of lager for the lads to share at the back of the bus, rewarding them for their hard work. I loved it. Watch out for him. Leeds are looking for a new manager and he would be ideal. ONE THING I WOULD CHANGE ABOUT... Fergie Time . Football should follow rugby and have the old time keeper sat up in the stands, separate from everybody. It would help avoid any question or doubt about Fergie Time. Tick tock! Using an independent timekeeper as they do in rugby would prevent a 'Fergie Time' fiasco . They should have full control of the clock, the time-wasting and the ball being out of play and independently decide on added time. As soon as that time comes to an end, a massive foghorn should be blown around the stadium to end the game, wherever the ball is on the pitch. It would create entertainment and talking points. I reckon that would be magic – unless we were a goal down, on the attack and it went off! THE BIG ISSUE...Why has Louis van Gaal splashed almost £60million on Angel di Maria? My old youth team manager at QPR George Graham, from whom I learnt so much, always said that you have to build teams from the back. He stood by that. Building from the back: United chose to spend £60m on Angel di Maria when what they needed was defenders . Manchester United should've spent that huge fee for Di Maria on German centre-back Mats Hummels and Real Madrid's Sami Khedira. Hummels would've been a central figure and a leader and Khedira could've been an enforcer in front of him. Real were making noises that they were willing to let him go for £27.5million. United now have Robin van Persie, Wayne Rooney, Juan Mata, Danny Welbeck, Adnan Januzaj – they were not crying out for Di Maria. Mr Van Gaal was pleading for patience after their Gaal-ing performance against my old club MK Dons in the League Cup. But that . was a real chance of silverware for them and he blew it. They've got no . chance of winning the Premier League, are not in Europe and the only cup . they could win is the FA Cup. Their team needs strengthening – and fast – to have any chance of that. Oops!

"Martin 'Mad Dog' Allen returns with the latest instalment of his column for MailOnline Sport. The Barnet boss does not hold back with his views on current issues in football and this week reflects on what might have been after he thought he had landed the England job and Liverpool's maverick forward Mario Balotelli. I THOUGHT MY ENGLAND CALL HAD ARRIVED . My old chairman at Brentford was that former top BBC boss, Greg Dyke. He was always nice to me and looked after me well and just let me get on with managing the team without any interference or any comment whether we won, lost or drew. All he ever said was, 'If you have a problem or you want a chat, give me a call.' Greg Dyke, Allen's old chairman at Brentford, gave Allen the impression he had the England job . Can you believe that at quarter-past 10 the other night, just before dropping into the land of sweet dreams, I looked at my phone, which had been on silent all evening, and I noticed a missed call from Greg Dyke. As we all know, he is now the chairman of the Football Association and chooses the England manager. With more wins than any other manager in the country this season – more than Jose Mourinho, Manuel Pellegrini and Arsene Wenger – I thought the time had come for Mad Dog to step up to manage the Three Lions. I never slept the whole night, working out where I was going to play Wayne and which health spa to send Raheem to rejuvenate his tired legs. Sadly, he never called back again and I found myself the next day managing Barnet away at Chelmsford, in the FA Cup fourth-round qualifying. The dream goes on. IT'S TOP DOG NOW - BUT WE HAVE TO KEEP GOING . It's been an unbelievable, incredible start to the season for all the players, the staff and supporters at Barnet football club. We are flying at the top of the Conference table. But I remember, when I was an 11-year-old boy, a long-distance runner called Brendan Foster, in the 1976 Montreal Olympic 10,000metre final. Halfway through, he was about a lap ahead, and looked untouchable. He was striding to glory in his white vest with red and blue coloured band. Jumping up and down on the settee, in our old-fashioned front room, I could not believe my eyes as he faded and drifted and anxiously looked over his shoulder. Martin Allen's Barnet side already have a nine-point lead at the top of the Conference . The other runners closed in, got close to him and gradually he faded away and had to settle for a bronze medal. That is the example I used with my Barnet players about the season ahead. We made a pledge at Barnet to train harder, improve our concentration, time-keeping, discipline, smartness, conduct and behaviour. There is still a long way to go this season and no time and no room to look over our shoulder and start fading. HOP, SKIPPING AND JUMPING AT QPR . I had the pleasure of being a special guest at my old club Queens Park Rangers for their Sunday afternoon game against Liverpool a couple of weeks ago. It was weird sitting in the Loftus Road stand, on the aisle where George Graham, our old youth team manager, used to make us run, hop, jump and sprint up and down every step. I was a 16-year-old who had just left school and George was fiercely demanding and his desire to improve all the young players physically and mentally would be frowned upon nowadays. But without that blood, sweat and tears, there is no way I would've had a career as an average footballer. Midfield general Allen played over 100 times for QPR between 1984 and 1989 . ALLEN'S ANALYSIS . THE PLAYER I KEEP HEARING ABOUT... ALEX McCARTHY . This goalkeeper is one to watch. I had the absolute pleasure of playing in a QPR team with the most laid-back, confident, calm goalkeeper. He never panicked or got stressed out. He oozed confidence, with his shoulders back, his head held high and a rascal of a dodgy moustache. His name was David Seaman. Alex McCarthy, seen here in action against Liverpool, is highly-rated by Mad Dog . His Friday nights weren't spent at home eating spaghetti and fresh fruit salad. He spent his pre-game nights perched at the side of a river carp fishing and sleeping in a little tent. Seaman was an amazing character. Having watched McCarthy play, Harry Redknapp has done well to pick him up for only £7m. With his stature, ability to come for crosses, strong body language, I think very soon he will be challenging Joe Hart for England's No 1 jersey and go on to achieve what Seaman did. He is top quality and top class. ONE THING I'D CHANGE ABOUT... FOOTBALL AGENTS' REPUTATIONS . All these football agents tend to have a bad reputation with most supporters. But they are vital in getting players in and out of clubs both to cut the wage bill and to try to improve your team. Gareth Bale's agent David Manasseh is one of the most successful and wealthy agents there is. During my useless spell as manager of Cheltenham Town, he was doing a deal to take Peter Crouch from Liverpool to Portsmouth for £9m back in 2008. But in between negotiating the deal at Anfield, he was texting me about a young midfielder available on a free transfer called Ian Westlake. I've got a lot of respect for someone who will still remember their client going on a free transfer when they're doing a deal worth millions. He called me recently about an 18-year-old centre forward, who is going to be a golden nugget for us. THE BIG ISSUE... MARIO BALOTELLI . I saw Mario Balotelli play for Manchester City at West Ham a couple of year ago and Roberto Mancini substituted him 10 minutes after half-time. He never broke sweat and looked uninterested, fed up, and constantly waved his hands at his team-mates in disgust at their passes and their efforts. Mancini hooked him and the few thousand City fans behind the goal all clapped him with energy and enthusiasm. Balotelli has struggled to make an impact at Liverpool since joining from AC Milan in the summer . But he walked from the pitch, sulking, looking at the ground, and never once acknowledged the supporters who had paid their hard-earned cash to travel to London and buy a ticket to watch their heroes play. Brendan Rodgers has got a tough task to transform Balotelli. There is no denying he can win you a game, but without a doubt a player like that will not win you the league.","Martin Allen has led Barnet to a superb start in the Conference so far .

"Martin 'Mad Dog' Allen returns with the latest installment of his weekly column for MailOnline Sport. The Barnet boss does not hold back with his views on current issues in football. KNEEMAR NEYMORE . That challenge on Neymar, which fractured a vertebra in his spine, was done with only one thing in mind – to hurt him. With no chance of getting hurt himself and the referee in a difficult position to see any tackle, Colombia's Juan Zuniga kneed Neymar in the lower back and kidney area to get him out of the game. A blow to that area hurts, believe me. Massive loss: Brazil will be without their start man Neymar after this tackle ended his World Cup . End of the line: Neymar is carried down the tunnel with his World Cup over . Pain: The challenge left Neymar writhing on the ground and a out of the remainder of the tournament . VIDEO Willian ready to fill Neymar's boots . Mistakes: David Luiz may have scored a stunning free-kick against Colombia but defensively he is a danger . It will be a big blow for Brazil to lose their one and only player with real Samba flair and I very much doubt they can go on to win the World Cup without him. I'm still waiting for David Luiz to make that game-changing mistake which costs the team. And without Neymar they will have no-one to save him. BRUISING BRAZIL . Brazil have been getting a lot of stick for their aggressive, tough-tackling performances in this tournament. In the old days, their pacey attacking full backs would be up and down the flanks, overlapping, their socks around their ankles and too tight shorts. Brazil have always been very competitive, very tenacious and full-on, but the difference is they always had players with proper passing ability that could entertain - and at times mesmerise - which they are lacking now. Reducer: Fernandinho was notable for his hatchet job on star Colombian James Rodriguez on Friday night . Decent dogs: Luis Gustavo, Fernandinho (both left) and Paulinho (right) are a solid, unspectacular midfield . Instead, they have a pack of decent dogs in their central midfield, quick into the tackle, incisive and destructive. They've played Luiz Gustavo, Fernandinho and Paulinho in their defensive midfield duo in this World Cup and, although people are complaining about their aggressive attitude and style of play, it's got them to the semi-final so far. VAN GAAL'S GAMBLE KRUL ON COSTA RICA . I see some people have questioned Louis Van Gaal's gamble to put Tim Krul in for the penalty shoot-out against Costa Rica. They have been saying what about the other goalkeeper? How's it going to affect his confidence? How's it going to affect him for the next round? Krul ending: The Holland substitute keeper came on to save twice during the penalty shoot-out . Big call: Van Gaal made a brave decision and he was rewarded with a place in the World Cup semi-finals . Quite right: Questions have been asked about the effect on Cillessen but a manager can't think like that . When you're a manager, you can't ever have that frame of mind, you can’t choose not to make a decision because it might upset someone. How ridiculous would that be? Krul's record, as we all know now, isn't great on penalties. Before that game he'd stopped just two of 20. But the Costa Rican players would've taken note of the change of keeper and they would no doubt have wobbled, knowing that he's been put in especially for this decisive part of the match. Anyone who is questioning Van Gaal – you must be mad. FAREWELL FELLAINI . Marouane Fellaini is not a Manchester United player. I'm sure Ryan Giggs, Paul Scholes, Michael Carrick and Robin van Persie would've been shaking their heads when he walked through the door last year. He is nasty, he is horrible to play against and he hurts people. Make no mistake, he can be very, very effective. He is good at attacking and defending set plays and is strong in a very direct style of play. Out of place: Fellaini can be effective but he is too niggly to be a Manchester United player . But that is not Manchester United. I can't think for one moment that Fellaini would be at all bothered if Van Gaal called him into his office when he's back from the World Cup and said, 'You're not for me, you can leave.' I'm sure Fellaini would smile, shake his hand and say no problem. He will be sitting on a treasure chest of money owed to him. I'm sure he's wealthy already, but with players' contracts the signing on fees would have to be paid. Money talks: If Louis van Gaal wants to get rid of the Belgian it will cost a lot to end the long-term contract . If they really do want him out, he and his agent can negotiate a settlement on his contract and salary owed which will make him a very, very rich young man. My week... We started pre-season training last Thursday at Barnet and for the first time in 17 years of football management I've got barely any staff. Two players called Graham Stack and John Nurse are helping me here and there with the training. Both blokes are proper men, who've had good careers and have maximised the football ability that they were blessed with. Helping out: Goalkeeper Graham Stack is helping out with the coaching this season at Barnet . They've had promotions, they've had ups and downs and they are both good family people. I've gambled on having less staff so that their potential wages can go to bringing in new players and paying better wages . The only other staff member I've got is a young physio called Jade from the youth team. At the end of the day, you can have the best coach, the best assistant manager, the best analysts, the best sports scientists, the best training ground and the best pair of boots, but if your players are rubbish it's all worth nothing. My old boss Harry Redknapp always, always said it's all about players and getting good players in. Now the challenge is to get two or three more in so that the next 10 months will be special.","Juan Zuniga's knee on Neymar could only have been to hurt Brazilian .

"Martin 'Mad Dog' Allen returns with . the latest installment of his weekly column for MailOnline Sport. The . Barnet boss does not hold back with his views on current issues in . football. THE BOY NEEDS HELP . As a manager you're dealing with problems and situations with your players day in day out. Many of them you keep out of the public eye if possible. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Uruguay fans wearing Luis Suarez masks after he was banned . Hungry: Luis Suarez was banned for four months by FIFA after biting Giorgio Chiellini on Tuesday . I prefer to try my utmost to get them help, support and guidance with the assistance of the Professional Footballers' Association and the Sporting Chance Clinic. Luis Suarez has quite clearly got some major issues going on in his life which he and Liverpool have to face up to. He fell into Giorgio Chiellini? That's rubbish. Hold your hands up. Admit you've got issues. Sit down and deal with them. His rabid, animal-type behaviour is unacceptable. It reminds me a couple of weeks ago when I was on holiday and a little boy had his ice cream snatched out of his hand by his older brother. Loose cannon: Suarez should make the most of the help available through the PFA and Sporting Chance Clinic . VIDEO I didn't mean to bite - Suarez . The little kid chomped his older brother's arm and just walked off. Maybe Luis had his ice cream nicked off him when he was a little kid! Whatever is the reason for his biting habit, he needs sort it out. LUIS IS BAD, BUT IT COULD BE WORSE . Australian rugby league player Anthony Watts was accused of biting an opponent in the unmentionables last year. It was in a Gold Coast league game between Tugun Seahawks and Bilambil Jets. I was reading about it in a newspaper while on holiday. Watts denied it, but he was handed an eight-match ban. Ouch: Anthony Watts was accused of biting an oppenent's genitals during an Australian rugby league match . Banned: Watts denied the offence but was suspended for eight matches after the incident . SAINTS STRIPPED . At the end of last season it looked like a very exciting time to be a Southampton supporter, player or member of staff. Now new manager Ronald Koeman is faced with a very tough task. With Nicola Cortese leaving six months ago, Rickie Lambert gone to Liverpool, Luke Shaw to Manchester United, with Adam Lallana set for Liverpool and Morgan Schneiderlin looking on his way to Arsenal, those core, key players will be very difficult to replace. The owner, Katharina Liebherr, will be absolutely delighted to have banked more than £60m. But for Southampton fans it is worrying times for them after an incredible ride over the last few years. I fear, unless Koeman works miracles, they won't be far off relegation next season. Summer sale: Luke Shaw is among the Southampton stars to secure a move away from the club . WORLD CUP WOES . The World Cup is an amazing event, but with England out it really does gnash me off. It's just not the same when we're not in it anymore and all the players have come home. Who will win it? I think it'll be the Germans. They are disciplined, honest, mobile, athletic, can defend set plays, are strong in the air and they have a team spirit that will continue to grind out results. A lot of people are backing Brazil, and I'm sure they will go close, but at some point David Luiz will make a massive mistake – he always does – and that'll be it for them. Always deliver: Martin Allen has backed Germany to go on and win the World Cup . My week... My last week on holiday has been spent constantly on the phone, trying to find players through their agents to put a decent team together at Barnet. A manager never rests. The job never stops. We're starting pre-season on Thursday and all my focus is trying to build a team, like a jigsaw puzzle. I'm trying to put together all the ingredients for success. When signing players, you're trying to find speed, experience, good character, reliability, a few personalities, a few on their way out, a couple on their way down. As Harry Redknapp once said to me, you can't have 11 choir boys in your team.","Liverpool striker Suarez must accept that he needs to face up to his issues .

"Martin 'Mad Dog' Allen returns with the latest installment of his weekly column for MailOnline Sport. The Barnet boss does not hold back with his views on current issues in football. RICKIE LAMBERT GOT ME THE SACK . I'm so pleased for Rickie Lambert, getting a dream move to his hometown club Liverpool. What a remarkable story going from the lower leagues to playing in a World Cup and the Champions League aged 32. Dream come true: England striker Rickie Lambert is set to join hometown club Liverpool from Southampton . I remember all-too well how deadly he can be as a striker. He put a nail in my coffin as manager of Cheltenham Town back in 2009 when he grabbed a winner playing for Bristol Rovers at the Memorial Ground on a Tuesday night. Lambert had already scored once and, with the score tied at 2-2 and the game going into the final five minutes, I thought we were set for a point. But suddenly, out of nowhere, he smashed in a half-volley from around the penalty spot and won them the game. Soon after that, I watched him play for Rovers at Wycombe Wanderers and he integrated into midfield and linked up play in a similar style to what is required by Brendan Rodgers at Liverpool. He played wide, he played deep, and he played on the shoulder. Over the years I've seen him play at all levels and he is more than just an old-fashioned, six foot two, Bob Latchford-style centre forward. With Liverpool in the Champions League they will need a lot more players to cope with the games, the injuries, suspensions and general fatigue, especially in the season following a World Cup. It will be a big test for Brendan and at only £4million I think he has got a bargain. All smiles: Rickie Lambert celebrates scoring for Bristol Rovers - a goal which saw Martin Allen sacked as Cheltenham manager back in 2009 . ROY NEEDS TO DITCH ROONEY . Forget the reputation. Forget the history. The decision on Wayne Rooney has to be made on current form. People are wondering how to fit Raheem Sterling into the England team. There's no question, he needs to be playing ahead of Rooney. He should be one of the first names on the team sheet playing behind Daniel Sturridge, just as he's done so well for Liverpool. The boy is not a winger. His game has changed and for Liverpool he has been quite outstanding playing in that No 10 role with his speed, quality in the final third, willingness to track back and help defensively. Forget reputation: Wayne Rooney needs to be ditched for Raheem Sterling based on current form . He can retain possession and keep the ball moving with one and two touch play and, for me, we should start with him against the Italians who lack pace and speed at the back. Wayne has been a magnificent player but, like Fernando Torres, he started at such a young age and it looks to me as though his best days are now behind him. The pace has gone and the fuel-injection system he had in his engine is now a steady four-door family saloon. Start Sterling and anything can happen. GOOD RIDDANCE, BRUTAL DAVID LUIZ . To get £50m for David Luiz - a centre half who is a liability, trying back-heels and flicks, running out of position, charging around everywhere - is nuts. Last year, I watched a Chelsea versus Brentford FA Cup match and with Chelsea winning 4-0 there was a 50-50 on the half-way line between Luiz and a young 19-year-old called Jake Reeves who had just come on as a substitute. It was a 50-50 with the ball five yards away and both running at full speed. Good riddance: Martin Allen is glad to see David Luiz departing Chelsea after witnessing the Brazilian's challenge on young Brentford player Jake Reeves last year . It was the last minute of this London derby. The game was already over. Chelsea had won it. What did Luiz do? He lifted his elbow and smashed the young whippersnapper straight across his forehead and sparked him out, in a similar fashion to the way Carl Froch took down George Groves on Saturday, on the Stamford Bridge canvas. Incredibly the referee let him get away with it while Reeves was unconscious on the floor. That day I was doing commentary for ITV and the Mad Dog mist descended one again. I so badly wished I would have had the chance just to play one more time with him in the opposition team. GOING COMMANDO . My bags are packed with old kit and boots, my toothbrush and one set of training kit, for a week's visit to Burkino Faso in west Africa where I will be taking a coaches training programme for the charity 'Coaching for Hope.' I'm taking no clothes apart from the ones I'm travelling in. Instead my bag is filled with colouring pens, colouring books, balloons, old football kit and old trainers for when I visit the orphanages in one of the poorest countries in the world. There is not even any room for my underpants. In this Mad world of football management it helps me appreciate just how lucky we all are when you meet these people with big smiles on their faces, enjoying life. In the mornings, at half-past seven, the children walk miles to school. There are no big four-by-fours or cars running the kids about. Talent: Young Burkina Faso player Bertrand Traore signed a four-year contract with Chelsea in January . At half-one in the afternoon, in the boiling sun, they calmly walk back and then from three o'clock onwards, on every spare patch of land, you see kids, children and youths playing football everywhere. And I mean, everywhere. It's no wonder Burkino Faso won the 2011 African Under 17 Championship and that Barcelona, Real Madrid and Manchester United have set up academies to attract the best young players. When I was over there before, I once met a 15-year-old lad who was built like Mike Tyson, could run like Steve Ovett and was a machine in central midfield. It is no wonder in January the player, Bertrand Traore, now 18, signed a four-year professional contract with Chelsea. These boys are so fit, so strong. They are hungry and technically, after playing on orangey-grey shale for so many years, they are top drawer. They play football seven days a week, they have no laptops, iPads, and very few TVs.I cannot wait to see those lovely smiles once again. My week... Last Monday I went to see Fleetwood Town win promotion in the League Two play-off final against Burton Albion. I was fortunate enough to get tickets sat right behind the dugouts as a guest of the Football League. Instead of taking advantage of the hospitality, I was there five yards behind the dugout eating a hot dog as long as my arm filled with onions and tomato sauce. I'm not sure the prawn sandwich brigade and the substitutes sat on the bench appreciated the waft as I sat there munching away. At the end of the game both the ecstasy and the agony were just 10 yards away on either side. To my left it was the wives and families of the Fleetwood players taking photos, hugging, singing and dancing. They new there would be new deals offered, bonuses triggered and bigger contracts. But just 10 yards to my right, the Burton family and friends sat there dejected, proud of their partners and sons but overwhelmed, several with tears streaming down their cheeks. The players were probably wondering whether they were going to have new deals for next season. The great rise: Fleetwood have been promoted for the sixth time in nine years . Down in front of me Graham Alexander was hugged by everybody as he proudly squeezed every player and member of staff with smiles from ear-to-ear. I looked across to the Burton bench and it was handshakes and pats on the back all round. Their manager Gary Rowett has done a fantastic job on a small budget and he is definitely a manager to look out for. He stood there quietly and calmly, taking the defeat diplomatically and in the right spirit. I imagine he was probably trying to work out already which players he would be letting go on free transfers to freshen up his squad, ready for the challenge he faces next season. This is the reality of lower-level football where most players now get one-year deals and it is make or break. Fleetwood's players are now probably off on two-week holidays, with plenty of sunshine, knowing their future is firmly secured. The Burton players will be ringing their agents hoping to get a club. It's a Mad world in football.","Rickie Lambert set to sign for hometown club Liverpool .

YAYA NEEDS HIS COMEUPPANCE . What an absolute farce the situation at Manchester City with Yaya Toure has become. There's only one thing that man wants – and that is more money and a longer contract. It was rubbish what his agent Dimitry Seluk said about him being unhappy that the club did not celebrate his birthday. There's no doubt he is top quality and top class, and without him Manchester City would not have won the Barclays Premier League. Exit: Yaya Toure wanted to leave City after claiming that nobody wished him happy birthday . Evidence: Manchester City said that Toure did receive a cake on the plane on their post-season tour . Influence: Toure was instrumental in City winning the Premier League this season . But why his agent didn't just go and knock on Sheikh Mansour's door to negotiate another year and a further pile of wedge is beyond me. The conduct and behaviour of some of these agents is quite despicable. At 31, Toure has no resale value and I would love it, really love it, if City told him he was not going to get a new contract, point out he's got a deal in place at the moment and tell him get on with it. He can take his birthday cake and stick it where the sun doesn't shine. THE WEST HAM EVOLUTION . There is an interesting situation developing at my old club West Ham. How will it evolve there? The board are now taking more responsibility for signings and have ordered a change in the style of play and the introduction of a new attacking coach. Is an attacking coach one who concentrates on technical finishing skills in and around the 18-yard box, or do you give him a bag of balls, the bibs and the discs and let him dictate the style of play of the team? Brief: Sam Allardyce has been told West Ham must play a more attractive style of football next season . For me, you defend as a team, and defend from the front. And you attack as a team, starting from the goalkeeper and going through all the players in your squad. Does the attacking coach make decisions on where the full-backs pass it to retain possession or look for penetrating diagonal and forward passes? Does he work with the back four, the midfield four, the one in the hole, who at the moment is Kevin Nolan, and the big man up front Andy Carroll? Back in the swing: Teddy Sheringham has been lined up for a role as attacking coach at Upton Park . It will be very interesting to see if this works, or if it turns into a catastrophe. There will certainly be interesting discussions at the West Ham training ground this summer. QPR'S PROMOTION RETRIBUTION . I only ever managed one cup final and that was for QPR in 1986 against Oxford at Wembley Stadium, on a Sunday afternoon, in front of almost 91,000 people. We lost, I was the worst player on the pitch and got substituted after a shocking display. My legs just would not move and the occasion proved too much for the young pup I was at the time. We are going up: QPR beat Derby at Wembley in the Championship play-off final on Saturday . Hero: Bobby Zamora scored the winner in injury time to send QPR back to the Premier League . Glory: QPR's fans celebrate their promotion in the Wembley sunshine . The QPR fans left early on the day, leaving the blue and white end of Wembley virtually empty. Sitting on the bench, having been substituted, I shook my head with tears in my eyes knowing I had let them all down. To see those fans on Saturday, when they won promotion back to the Premier League, singing and celebrating for what can only be described as daylight robbery, was very special. Hopefully that makes it up to all of those fans who made the trip in 1986 that I so badly let down, and can finally put that one bed. My week... For three weeks it's been non-stop negotiation with an agent to sign a centre forward for the season ahead. His name is John Akinde, we signed him from Alfreton Town. He's big, he's strong, he's powerful and hopefully he will do the business. However, he's getting married this weekend and is off on his honeymoon to Thailand. Unrest: Protesters confront soldiers in riot gear during a city centre anti-coup rally in Bangkok . Concern: Allen hopes his new striker John Akinde avoids danger on his honeymoon in Thailand . Now, after seeing the reports on the news about the goings on in Bangkok, where the army are clashing with protesters, I'm starting to get a little concerned. I'm sure he will have a wonderful time, but it's not the most ideal place to visit at the moment and I'd like my new striker to be terrorising defences for me next season. As a manager you always hope players do the right thing through the summer break and I'm just keeping my fingers crossed that he comes back in one piece.","Yaya Toure's agent should have knocked on Sheikh Mansour's door to negotiate a new contract rather than behave the way he did .
West Ham's board are taking more responsibility for signings and want a better style of play .
After my Wembley heartbreak in 1986, it was nice to see QPR players and fans celebrating Promotion back to the Premier League .

"Martin . 'Mad Dog' Allen returns with the latest installment of his weekly . column for MailOnline Sport. The Barnet boss does not hold back with his . views on current issues in football. WHERE WAS JOHN TERRY? I've no idea what has happened behind the scenes regarding John Terry and England. Conversations must have taken place and decisions made about him not being a part of the national team because any manager would want his best 11 players on the pitch for the big games. No doubt there have been some difficult relationship issues behind the scenes. Sun-soacked: While England were being knocked out of the World Cup, John Terry was on holidays with his wife Toni . Missed: Terry played 78 times in an England shirt and would have been an asset again if available for Brazil . However, Terry was the best English centre back in the Barclays Premier League last season, without a shadow of a doubt. He played practically every game in the league for Chelsea and went about his business quietly and efficiently.Terry would’ve been an absolute banker to be starting in the England team in every game we played in the World Cup. I'm sure with mediation between the . Football Association, Roy Hodgson and the captain Steven Gerrard, . problems could've been sorted out. Still the one: Terry was the best English centre back in the Premier League last season . Down and out: Despondent England captain Steven Gerrard and coach Roy Hodgson face the press on Sunday . Of course John would've had to respect the choice of leader but I'm sure at the World Cup he would have been adaptable and supportive and, more than anything, helpful for Gerrard in captaining our country. Terry's presence, authority, body language and karma in the big games would've most definitely improved our team. NOW IS THE TIME TO BACK ROY HODGSON . I sat watching England versus Uruguay at three o'clock in the morning in the chef's kitchen on the only television at a yoga spa retreat in Thailand. The chef was watching it with me and we both had our England shirts on in a place in the jungle that you can only get to by boat. I actually thought England played well; there was bound to be anxiety in what was the biggest game in a lot of those players' careers. Disappointment: Roy Hodgson's England may have bowed out in the group, but the team did their country proud . I sat with the chef disappointed and saddened but I still think the team put a shift in and had a real go. After visiting South Africa as an England supporter in 2010 and watching Fabio Capello's team not turn up, and not do our country proud, I thought this was a very different performance. I'm pleased younger players have been given an opportunity and I'm pleased Hodgson has tried to get the team to play from the back and pass the ball more, which everybody has wanted for years. Young guns: The likes of Raheem Sterling (left) and Ross Barkley got a chance and didn't let England down . Now it's time to back the manager's judgment and let him lead the transition by bringing in more younger, fresher faces to play alongside those who have now got big tournament experience. Hodgson is a fine ambassador, you can tell that he has the respect of the players. It is disappointing but it is not, for me, all doom and dismay. GIVE HOCKY A CHANCE . Yes, it's a gamble. Yes, I understand all Leeds fans will be sceptical. But their new manager David Hockaday is a good guy. He is honest, hard-working, very professional and he will get his team to play passing football out from the back and through midfield to attack. David has been my assistant three times at different clubs over the years so I've witnessed his work first-hand. Give him a go: Leeds United's new head coach David Hockaday (right) is hard-working and professional . Of course, only time will tell if the appointment works. Most managers nowadays are only lasting 14 months tops, so who is to say he is the wrong man for the job? The last man in charge, Brian McDermott, got Reading into the Premier League and for some reason the owner didn't think he was good enough. He brought through loads of good young players and hardly spent a pound note and still he was sacked. Not enough: Brian McDermott (left) was sacked by new owner Massimo Cellino (right) after doing little wrong . I urge all Leeds supporters to get behind the team, as, at the end of the day, it is the team that counts, not whoever the bloke is in the technical area. Clubs are chopping and changing, and there is no doubt the old life in football management is well and truly Mad. But give David Hockaday a chance. MY WEEK... I've been in Thailand on holiday and, as I mentioned earlier, went out to a luscious yoga spa retreat in the middle of nowhere. The evening after the England defeat to Uruguay I sat in the dining room with all the happy hippies and it did make me smile when a dude – and that is the only way to describe him – from Norway, with his body covered in tattoos, a goatee, a pony tail and dressed in what looked my granddad's pyjamas, got his guitar out and started the evening's entertainment with the theme tune of this place: Puff the Magic Dragon. I've never seen so many happy teetotallers in all my life. It certainly helped take my mind off England's nightmare World Cup.","Terry was the best English centre back in the Premier League last season .
Whatever happened for him to be out of the England set-up could surely have been fixed with mediation from Roy Hodgson and Steven Gerrard .
Roy Hodgson deserves to be backed after the way England played .
England's young side did their country proud, unlike Fabio Capello's in 2010 .
David Hockaday should be given a chance as Leeds manager .
Former Forest Green boss is hard-working and very professional ."
"After weeks of promotion, Tony Bellew and Nathan Cleverly finally come together in the most bitter of grudge matches and in an eliminator for the WBO world cruiserweight title. The build-up has made both fighters household names. We sold out the Echo Arena in 48 hours, it's the fastest-ever selling sporting event there and the pay-per-view numbers look really strong. I've been nervous this week. We've seen some grudge matches before but this is more bitter than I've ever experienced. With George Groves against Carl Froch it was a case of, 'I can't stand that bloke,' but this is more like, 'I want to finish him now.' Nathan Cleverly and Tony Bellew get set for their rematch at Liverpool's Echo Arena on Saturday . Both Cleverly and Bellew weighed in in Liverpool ahead of their cruiserweight clash . The atmosphere wasn't pleasant at the press conference on Thursday or up on stage at the weigh-in because it was very personal; there were plenty of insults traded. I think Nathan believes that Tony is using these insults because he's desperate. To be honest, I thought Tony would lose his marbles more than he has but he’s been able to keep it together. Obviously Tony will have the majority of the support with the fight being in Liverpool but I think this is the kind of event to which neutrals will come. If you are a neutral, you'd probably favour Nathan because he has kept himself to himself in the build-up. You're more likely to have an opinion of Tony. There is plenty of bad blood between the pair, who have fought on one previous occasion . Security step in as things get heated on stage at the weigh in for Saturday's fight . Marco Huck, the WBO champion, and the WBC champion Grigory Drozd are flying in to see what is the biggest fight in the division; they all want to fight the winner. Either fighter against Huck and either fighter against the winner of Ola Afolabi against IBF champion Yoan Hernandez is a massive fight. But if you asked Nathan and Tony if they'd rather win a world title or win on Saturday night, the answer would be to win this fight. It means much more to them than a world title. I believe there's a future for both of them in the division but losing is not an option for either of them. I really like both guys and my job as a promoter is to provide the best fights, and that was this one. Welshman Cleverly weighed in just below the 200lb cruiserweight limit set for the fight . Bellew was also just inside the weight limit at 199lbs when he stepped on the scales . Cleverly at an open workout in Cardiff in the week leading up to the fight . But unfortunately one of them will lose and he will be my fighter. Normally I am screaming and shouting at ringside but I won't be this time. I don't have any favourites, it's a case of may the best man win. There are so many questions surrounding this fight. We don't know how hard Tony punches at cruiserweight. He's had two good knockouts against two durable fighters but Nathan stood up to Tony before. How mentally strong is Nathan? He looked massive on the scales but does he still have the speed he had at light-heavyweight. Does he punch harder? The only argument I don't think you can make is a Tony Bellew victory on points; that's the only result I don't see happening. I see Nathan on points and by stoppage and I see Tony by stoppage. I think it will come down to game plans going out the window and both guys trading and one guy getting knocked out spectacularly. It could be either one. Bellew is determined to beat Cleverly this time having pushed him all the way during their first meeting . Joe Calzaghe (right) joins Eddie Hearn (left) and Cleverly at his training session in Cardiff . Bellew and Cleverly fought in 2011 at Liverpool's Echo Arena with the Welshman winning a thrilling bout . Whatever happens, I want both men to shake hands but I don't think they will which is a shame. But that's one of the reasons the fight is so big, because of that vicious rivalry. The point of boxing is to leave it all in the ring and afterwards it is about respect. I will be straight in the ring to tell both fighters to congratulate each other. I tried to do it after Froch-Groves I but it didn't really work out because of the way it finished. Sometimes it runs too deep and this might be another example of that. George Groves and James DeGale are heading for a rematch and it almost happened after the weigh-in when both camps came face-to-face and the fighters had to be pulled apart by security. There were family members and team members involved. They don't like each other and it goes way back. You talk about Nathan and Tony but this goes way deeper; back to when they were teenagers. There is a lot of history there and it's distracting because they're both in big fights on Saturday night. George Groves will face Denis Douglin on the undercard at the Echo Arena . James DeGale is on course for a rematch with Groves and their camps clashed on Friday at the weigh-in . James has a tough fight against Marco Antonio Periban and George takes on Denis Douglin but it's the kind of distraction that could sometimes prove to be a banana skin. What it means, however, is that the rematch gets bigger and bigger; it looks inevitable for next year. Also on the undercard, Scott Quigg defends his world title against Hidenori Otake who is unbeaten in 17 fights since 2007 and is here to win. He has brought 20 or 30 people to watch him; boxing is big in Japan and they have a lot of world champions. I think it's going to be tough; he's very durable. Quigg is getting better but I expect this to be his toughest fight yet. Scott Quigg will defend his world super bantamweight title against Hidenori Otake . Jamie McDonnell also has a very tough fight against late replacement Javier Chacon who was already in training. He's a little rottweiler and will be on Jamie non stop. But our man must win to secure his unification clash with Tomoki Kameda next year. Jamie McDonnell will take on late replacement Javier Chacon in a WBA bantamweight title defence . Callum Smith against Nikola Sjekloca is such a great fight. The Montenegrins are here to win. It's the same group who came over with Dejan Zlaticanin who beat Ricky Burns and they fully believe they are going to beat Callum. He has his hands full. Olympic heavyweight champ Anthony Joshua meets the experienced Michael Sprott. Many feel that AJ's speed and power will be too much for Sprott, but he has other ideas and is really up for this one. Keep your eyes peeled also for recent signing Bradley Saunders, lightweight champ Scotty Cardle and German KO king Vincent Figenburtz. Anthony Joshua (right) will face experienced Brit Michael Sprott in his 10th professional bout .

"Martin 'Mad Dog' Allen returns with the latest installment of his new weekly column for MailOnline Sport. The former Gillingham boss does not hold back with his views on current issues in football. The Wenger boys . After Arsenal's FA Cup final win at the weekend they are finally on the edge of competing with and beating the top teams. I'm sure through the summer Arsene Wenger will recruit an experienced, top-class central midfield player and a proven centre forward. In central midfield they've tried Mathieu Flamini and signed Sweden international Kim Kallstrom on loan. But neither are up to the level of a Patrick Vieira, Roy Keane, Nemanja Matic or David Luiz. Silverware: Arsenal won the 2014 FA Cup after coming from behind to beat Hull in a thrilling final . Uplifting: Mathieu Flamini (centre) lifts the FA Cup with Olivier Giroud (second left) next to him . Back: Flamini returned to Arsenal last summer . Steady: Giroud scored 22 goals in all competitions . They are players who sit in front of the back four and have the influence of a man of steel in the spine of the team. Up front Arsenal have lacked depth, relying on the inconsistent Olivier Giroud. Wenger needs to spend big and spend well and he could turn them into a team which can compete at the very top of the Barclays Premier League. This season when they lost Aaron Ramsey and Theo Walcott mid-way through the season, it ended their title chances. They did not have enough depth to cover for them. Hero: Aaron Ramsey scored the winning goal for Arsenal in extra-time to seal a 3-2 win at Wembley . Glory: Arsene Wenger lifts the FA Cup in front of thousands of spectators outside the Emirates Stadium . Both of those players have energy and the ability to turn games, as we saw with Ramsey's winner on Saturday to bring Wenger his first silverware in nine years. Their weakness through the season has been losing to the best teams. Arsenal have beaten all of the others hands down but struggled against Chelsea, Manchester City and Liverpool. I'm certain, with some top quality players - similar to the level of Mesut Ozil - brought in, they can push on from the FA Cup win and make the last step up to mix it with the big boys. Diego Simeone surely a top target . Another great result of the weekend was Atletico Madrid's draw against Barcelona to win the La Liga title. Atletico’s manager Diego Simeone has done an unbelievable job pipping the Spanish giants Barcelona and Real Madrid to be champions. And they have the chance to complete a sensational double when they face Real in the Champions League final on Saturday. Atletico have shown good team spirit, have tight organisation, clever player recruitment and proven that anything is possible for any team. Against all odds: Atletico Madrid were crowned Spanish champions after a draw at Barcelona on the final day . Mastermind: Diego Simeone is hoisted in the air by his players after Atletico won the Spanish league . Simeone must be a target for all the top clubs now. He is humble, he is down-to-earth, and he has clearly instilled in his players the magnificent values of respect on and off the field. Real Madrid and Barcelona – with all their Galacticos, Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo – must be scratching their heads wondering what they've got to do and where they have gone wrong. It is similar, I guess, in our Premier League, to Newcastle, with their wonderful fan base and huge 52,000-seater stadium, winning the league and going on to reach the Champions League final.No-one would think that possible right now. Newcastle madness . Newcastle fans deserve their club to be challenging in cup competitions and not to be told they are not bothered about winning the FA or League Cup. Privately, of course, it is only the Premier League that counts to clubs, but to go public with it and take away that hope seems mad to me. Uninspiring: Newcastle's season petered out into a rather disappointing mid-table finish . Newcastle have spent barely any money in recent years and still more than 50,000 supporters fill their stadium at every home game. Just after Christmas I watched Alan Pardew’s side play at West Ham and they were absolutely magnificent. They had pace, they were tight defensively, they had excellent technical players. In Yohan Cabaye playing behind the striker they had a player who could slide passes between the back four and on to the pace of the outstanding Loic Remy in front of him. Soon after that they sold Cabaye, Remy was hamstrung with injury and their season was over.Newcastle were hanging around the fifth and sixth places earlier in the season and in position to challenge for Champions League qualification. Disgruntled: Newcastle fans have made their feelings on the current regime known . Pardew was being spoken of as a potential manager of the year and future England manager.But they have lost their best players and the club is draining any hope of a bright future from the fans. Back him and don't sack him . Roy Hodgson's choice of players for this World Cup in Brazil is brave and, for me, he has made the right decisions. Leaving out Jermain Defoe and Ashley Cole, especially after Ashley's outstanding recent performances for Chelsea, were probably his toughest calls. But as fans we will have to be patient and not go into this tournament expecting victories. I was in South Africa at the last World Cup to watch them in Cape Town in a lifeless 0-0 draw with Algeria and Port Elizabeth when they scraped through the group in a 1-0 win against Slovenia. In the spotlight: Roy Hodgson named his England squad for the World Cup last Monday . Staying home: Ashley Cole was left out of the World Cup squad and retired from international football . Our ageing team had no energy, could not compete athletically and as a supporter it was awful to watch. Everyone was expecting, and of course hoping, that England would be good enough to get to the semis or the final. It was important we started looking to the future. These young lads who Roy has picked will hopefully be the mainstay of our team for the next World Cup in Russia. I think then this country could pull off a few shocks and surprises. My week... A Dog's Life . On Tuesday night it was back to West Ham United for a game between an ex-West Ham XI and a West Ham fans XI - who had the full match-day experience against a few legends – and for some reason they asked me along too. Pre-match meal for me was double pie, double mash and liquor, which I ate in the club car park an hour-and-a-half before kick off. Just round the corner from the ground, Nathan's Pie Shop has been running for about 40 years and lovely old Brenda, we call her blue-rinse Brenda, who has worked their for 25 years, showed the real East End spirit by folding up £10 in her hand to give to the Great Ormond Street bucket collectors at Upton Park, who we were raising money that day. It's funny, going back and being in that tunnel just remembering the old days. The heart starts to race, the nostrils start to snarl, and the eyes start to squint. In the tunnel I was back to my old ways, eyeing up the opposition, just like I used to when I played there. The adrenaline rush is quite unbelievable. But you soon realise when you cross the white line that you can't get about the pitch anymore and you certainly can't tackle, intimidate and dominate your opponent like you used to. Dean Ashton was magnificent. Frank McAvennie was slower than me but had some magic touches.Rob Lee was fit as a butcher's dog and showed class. All in all, it was a great night raising money for the Great Ormond Street Children's Hospital and it's a special feeling meeting back up with your former team-mates and remembering old times.","Arsene Wenger needs to strengthen for Arsenal to compete at the top .

"I’m currently planning the next move for Tony Bellew after he got his revenge over Nathan Cleverly. We all expected fireworks and unfortunately the main event just didn’t live up to it. But Tony did what he had to do and now has a great future in front of him – I’m in talks with both Marco Huck and Yoan Hernandez about cruiserweight world-title fights with Tony. The rest of the division know that he sells. The numbers from the weekend were very good and that makes him commercially attractive to all of them. The next move for Tony Bellew is being planned after he did what he had to do to beat Nathan Cleverly . Cruiserweight world title fights against Marco Huck or Yoan Hernandez could be on the cards for Bellew (right) At the moment, it looks like his next fight will be for a world title in the spring. We are already in discussions with Huck, the WBO champion from Germany, and I can reveal we are also talking to Hernandez, the Cuban who has the IBF belt. We have seen the city of Liverpool get behind Tony and I am in talks about putting on a fight for him at Goodison Park. The question is whether we could get one of the world champions to fight over here. From that point of view, Hernandez seems more willing to travel, so we’ll wait and see how it pans out in the next few weeks. Bellew, seen here during the fight with Cleverly, sports the Everton badge on his shorts and robe . A Liverpool homecoming at Goodison Park is on the cards for Bellew .","We're planning Tony Bellew's next move after he beat Nathan Cleverly .

"As you’ll know by now, Carl Froch’s spring fight with Julio Cesar Chavez Jnr has been put back because Carl has injured his elbow. It’s heartbreaking for Carl because he desperately wants a Las Vegas fight before he hangs up his gloves, but I am already looking at the possibility of rescheduling for a summer fight against Chavez. Other fights such as Bernard Hopkins and Gennady Golovkin have also been discussed - we will see how it plays out. From Carl’s point of view, this latest setback is tough to take. We were so close to getting all the details in place for a March 28 fight, but three weeks into training he hurt his elbow. He is the consummate professional and has fought injured before but he won’t make that mistake again, especially for what might be his last bout. Carl only made the call to postpone last week so now he will take some time to digest that and in the meantime I’m looking at the options. This setback has been frustrating for all of us. I have worked on it for months. Carl Froch wants to fulfil one of his dreams by fighting in Las Vegas before he hangs up his gloves . Froch's March 28 fight with Julio Cesar Chavez Jnr (left) has been postponed because of injury . A fight against Gennady Golovkin has been discussed - but money will determine the route he goes down . A Chavez fight still appeals a lot to us and whatever route we go the deal has to be right. That will be key in whatever fight he takes, whether it is against Chavez, Hopkins, Golovkin or anyone else. Carl is a warrior – everyone knows that. And that is why he would love to fight Golovkin. It would be a fight for the ages but both men would need to be rewarded for that. Those details need to be right. Likewise against Hopkins – they are great names and great fighters but so is Carl so the deal has to suit all parties. Watch this space because Carl will be going out with a bang. One man waiting in the wings is James Degale, mandatory challenger for Carl’s IBF belt. James is looking to become the first Brit Olympic gold medalist to go on and win a world title - expect a big announcement on his opponent soon and history to be made this spring. Bernard Hopkins has passed 50 but is showing no signs of slowing down and wants 'at least one more fight' Kell Brook is set for his big homecoming in Sheffield on March 28. The guy is so excited after everything he has been through and we will announce his opponent on Thursday. I’d back him to beat anyone – Amir Khan included. The opponent is not totally decided yet. We have been looking at Jo Jo Dan, who is No 1 ranked contender for Kell’s world title. We’ve also looked at Diego Chaves and Josesito Lopez, but there are maybe half a dozen names in the frame. He has been training hard after what happened in Tenerife and it is great that he is finally closing in on the first defence of his title. I’ll never forget the night he won against Shawn Porter in California – he proved there and then what he can do. Kell Brook won the IBF world welterweight title when he beat Shawn Porter in Los Angeles in August . Brook said he was the 'victim of an unprovoked attack' when he was stabbed on holiday last September but is ready for his big homecoming in Sheffield on March 28 but no opponent has been booked as yet . Eddie Hearn says it's time for Amir Khan (right, punching Devon Alexander) to step up and take the Brook fight . Kell has been sharp and fast in training and he’s also been a keen observer of all that goes on around him in the division. I can understand why Amir Khan has pushed so hard to get a Mayweather fight – if he lost that fight he could brush it off. If he lost to Kell, where does he go from there? It also looks like the deadline Khan set Floyd to accept the fight has passed. So what next? He knows where we are. He has so much to lose in fighting Kell but is adamant he would win with ease. If he truly believes that then this is the fight that would make him more money than any other. I offered Khan $5million to take the fight before Kell won a world title. With a world title involved, the pot of money for this fight is even bigger. If Khan truly thinks he could beat Kell, then he should step up. I would back Kell every day of the week to win that fight. This year is going to be a big year for him and Amir wants the lion share of the pot - we are more than happy to have a 60-40 or 70-30 winner-takes-all deal. In fact, how about winner takes all? It’s big balls time. I caught up with Deontay Wilder’s win against Bermane Stiverne for the WBC world heavyweight title. I’m pleased for Wilder. He’s a character and a dangerous heavyweight, which is what the American heavyweight scene has lacked. He also proved his durability and now he has some proper options in front of him, including a rematch with Stiverne, a unification with Wladimir Klitschko or a fight with Britain’s Tyson Fury. That would be a fun event. Hearn caught up with Deontay Wilder’s win against Bermane Stiverne for the WBC world heavyweight title . Wilder also proved his durability and now has some options in front of him, including a rematch with Stiverne . Needless to say, we are keeping an eye on what is going on because down the line it will be of interest to our own man, Anthony Joshua, who is well ranked with the WBC. He’s had a setback after picking up a stress fracture in his back, but he will be back out on April 4 in Newcastle and I can reveal here that he will also fight on April 25 at the O2 Arena, hopefully against Kevin Johnson, who he was meant to fight this month before he injured his back. After that we will look to put him in a big fight at the back end of the summer and then Joshua will be knocking on the door for one of the world titles at the end of the year. Anthony Crolla is on the mend and we are looking at his options. It is a long road back and hard not to think that he should be preparing for his world-title shot right now. I am delighted for Derry Mathews to be getting a shot in Ant’s place against Richar Abril for the WBA world lightweight title. Derry is a good guy. Our options thereafter might be a shot at Derry, if he wins, but we are also keeping an eye on the WBO belt. Terence Crawford, the WBO champion, is likely to move up a weight, and we’d be tempted by a fight against Juan Diaz for the title in the summer. I think that can be made. Anthony Crolla is on the mend and Matchroom are looking at the Manchester boxer's options . Derry Mathews to be getting a shot in Crola’s place against Richar Abril for the WBA world lightweight title . I caught up with Floyd Mayweather recently and asked him about Manny Pacquiao but as ever he was not giving much away. But it sounds like this fight is closer than ever to happening. I gather a lot of the details are in place and that it is down to the TV networks to reach an agreement – that’s not a small factor in this sport. Anything can happen. I believe it’s 50-50 it will go ahead and I think it will be a two-fight plan, with one in May and the other in September. Floyd Mayweather's super-fight against Manny Pacquiao is closer than ever to happening . Pacquiao has set Mayweather a deadline of the end of this month to agree terms on the bout . The fact that Miguel Cotto’s fight with Saul Alvarez is off might complicate things as he is someone Mayweather would want to fight. But my hope, like everyone else’s, is that the fight with Pacquiao will finally happen. Don’t be surprised if Cotton wins the race though. It might be a couple of years too late for some but it will break every record that has ever been set in boxing. It will be an amazing clash of skill versus work rate and speed. I think Mayweather would edge it but it would be very close.","Carl Froch will return in the summer and fight Julio Chavez Jnr, Bernard Hopkins or maybe even Gennady Golovkin .

"The final touches are just about done for one of the biggest nights in British boxing on November 22, when Nathan Cleverly and Tony Bellew's rematch will headline a huge show at the Echo Arena in Liverpool. There have been setbacks but everything is now agreed and they are ready to go at each other again. I can also confirm that it will be an eliminator for the world cruiserweight title and currently we almost have a pick of the belts to go for. My best bet would be that the winner fights Marco Huck for the WBO title, but in reality I think the loser will also get a world-title shot. Frankly, this is the highest-profile fight in the whole division, a real grudge match, and the impression I get from my conversations is that all the title holders will want a piece of these two going forward. Nathan Cleverly says he will knock Tony Bellew out in their grudge rematch at Liverpool's Echo Arena . Cleverley (right) beat Bellew (left) in a tight majority decision in their first encounter in 2011 . Nathan Cleverly has vowed to become a two-weight world champion by disposing of Tony Bellew . The card will be on Sky Box Office and I must say I am proud to announce here the incredible line up we have. Scott Quigg will defend his WBA world super bantamweight title and we are in negotiations witg Joseph Agbeko, a two-time world champion, and also highly-ranked Shingo Wake. This would be the biggest test of Quigg's career and he has too much on the horizon for a slip up. We have begun initial talks with the McGuigans over the fight everyone wants to see – Quigg v Carl Frampton. Frampton has an injury at the moment and I wouldn't expect him to fight again until February or March so we wanted to get Quigg out in the meantime. I'm confident the fight with Frampton is going to happen next year. Also on the bill, I have James DeGale looking to impress ahead of his mandatory shot against Carl Froch next year. We have agreed terms with his opponent, it's a real fight - and we will announce the fight as soon as the contracts are signed. Carl Frampton won his IBF super-bantamweight world title bout against Kiko Martinez in Belfast . James DeGale beat Brandon Gonzales earlier this year and will get a shot at Carl Froch next year . The Liverpool card will also include WBA world bantamweight champion Jamie McDonnell against Walberto Ramos with the winner facing a unification bout with WBO champion Tomoki Kameda after we agreed a deal last week. Then, of course, there's Anthony Joshua. He will fight Michael Sprott in an eliminator for the British title after fighting first on October 11 against Denis Bakhtov for the WBC international heavyweight title. The October 11 show at the O2 Arena will be Joshua's first title fight ahead of a world title shot by the end of 2015. I can't tell you how excited I am by this guy. The stabilisers are off and now we are picking up serious speed. Also on the Liverpool show, there will be an outing for the incredible and unbeaten Callum Smith and his brother Stephen. Callum will face a huge step up against Montenegrin star Nikola Sjekloca (27-2) whose only defeats have come via points losses to Sakio Bika and recently Arthur Abraham for the WBO world title. The bout has been approved by the WBC as an official eliminator with the winner moving into a final eliminator in 2015. It's a massive statement fight for Callum - he is ready! I can't help thinking that this will be the highest quality card in this country in years with plenty more still to come. I'd like to say a few words about Paul Smith, who travelled to Germany last weekend and lost his world title challenge on points to Arthur Abraham. I am sickened by the scorecards that were produced in Kiel. Everyone knows that if you fight away then it is unlikely you will get the verdict from a tight fight. And this was a very tight fight, so I knew what we were up against when I climbed in the ring at the end of the fight. Paul Smith (right) says he wants a rematch against Arthur Abraham after his defeat on Saturday . Paul Smith gave a good account of himself against Arthur Abraham and many have questioned the result . The judges voted unanimously in favour of Abraham, much to Smith's frustration and disappointment . But to hear the three judges gives Abraham, a great champion, the verdict by such wide margins was a disgrace. It was inept judging at its worse. We have made an official petition to the WBO and they will review the footage and I cannot see any other option than to make Paul the mandatory challenger for the title and order an immediate rematch. I'd also like to see greater scrutiny placed on judges in terms of a greater test of their knowledge of the sport. These people have livelihoods and dreams in their hands and cannot be allowed to make such terrible decisions. I've been talking in detail with Wembley and they are very keen for us to come back with another show after the success of Froch-Groves. I can reveal here that I have pencilled in June 27 and July 4 and will likely hold a show on one of those dates. It could be Carl Froch, possibly against James DeGale, and Kell Brook versus Amir Khan would fill it. Kell will probably make his comeback in March and would then be ready for a huge summer fight. Watch this space. Carl Froch knocked out George Groves in their second fight at Wembley Arena earlier this year . I've got a show in Leeds on October 4 and it could potentially place two top British fighters on a collision course. We have Josh Warrington, a great young fighter who at 23 already has the British and Commonwealth featherweight title. On Saturday he fights Davide Dieli for the European belt at the First Direct Arena. Josh is the biggest individual ticket seller in the country. He sells 2,000 himself, through his own phone, more or less. Then he often delivers them by hand. The European title was vacated by Welshman Lee Selby, who fights Joel Brunker in an IBF world title eliminator on the October 11 bill in London. The idea of Selby and Warrington fighting in the future appeals to me. The Leeds card will also see Brian Rose return after his world title challenge, and Ricky Burns fights at light-welterweight against Alexnadre Lepelley. Expect one of the best atmospheres you've seen on Saturday - the Leeds fans are ready to blow the roof off. There's a lot to look forward to at the moment.","I can reveal here one of the best fight cards to have happened in British boxing .

"I met with Carl Froch last week and the first thing I could see is that he is getting itchy knuckles again. This guy wants to fight. There are a lot of discussions going on at the moment and as it stands it looks to me like a fight with Julio Cesar Chavez is not going to happen. I don’t think Chavez wants to fight anyone at the moment, let alone Carl, who is not at the age where he wants to be waiting around for challengers to say yes or no. James DeGale is now strong favourite to get the fight, probably in February or March of next year. Going, going, gone: Carl Froch knocked out George Groves in May and could now fight James Degale (below) Winning: DeGale looked impressive as earned the mandatory challenger shot by beating Brandon Gonzales . James is obviously Carl’s mandatory challenger for the IBF super-middleweight belt and under those terms Carl has to fight him by the end of February or give up the belt. Carl is not the sort of fighter who just gives up a belt so I think that fight is now very likely. I have had some discussions about possible venues and I am looking at a few outdoor stadia, including the City Ground in Nottingham, Carl’s hometown. He has filled big arenas from Manchester to Wembley to the O2 and this is the kind of fight and venue that excites him. We are working on it. Mikkel Kessler also remains an option, be it for this next fight or the one after. They just have great fights with each other and at 1-1 between the two there is an appetite to justify making it. But DeGale is the strong favourite at the moment. He is young, hungry and talented. He might make his next appearance on the huge card I am arranging in Sheffield on December 6. After that he could get the big one – like I said, I can’t see Carl vacating a title. Talks are ongoing over a fight between Kell Brook and Amir Khan. It is going well because I think everyone realises it makes sense. Khan obviously wants a fight with Floyd Mayweather, as does everyone in the division, but he knows that while that fight might never happen, even if it did he would make more money fighting Kell. Everything so far has been very straightforward and I am in talks with Wembley over a May date. They want us back there as soon as possible after the success of Froch-Groves – I have no doubt in my mind that we would fill that stadium again. I hope to have this tied up in the next month or so. World champion: Kell Brook beat Shawn Porter to win the IBF welterweight title last month . Connecting: Amir Khan could fight Brook next May after making his welterweight debut against Luis Collazo . In the spirit of huge domestic fights, the massive rematch between Tony Bellew and Nathan Cleverly looks set to happen on December 6 in Sheffield. I am planning a big homecoming card for Kell Brook’s first fight after winning his world title and this fight would sit perfectly alongside it. You’ll have noticed a bit more needle than usual between Nathan and Tony on Twitter. I spoke to Nathan last week and he quite rightly would rather have the fight at a neutral venue after winning in Liverpool last time. Coming for you: Nathan Cleverly and Tony Bellew are almost ready to agree to their rematch . I have always said that I would take the fight to the most commercially attractive venue and until recently that was probably going to be Liverpool. But the option of staging a big card in Sheffield was too good to miss so we will try to go there. I will see Tony this week to go over the details. Both fighters obviously would have preferred to fight in their hometown – this provides a sensible solution and an epic night in Sheffield. All being well, this brilliant fight will be signed off at the end of this week. It’s a big couple of weeks for two of the best super-bantamweight fighters in the world. My guy, Scott Quigg, will defend his WBA world title on September 13 in Manchester against Stephane Jamoye, while this weekend Carl Frampton challenges Kiko Martinez for the IBF belt. I think both British fighters will come through these tests and then they simply must have a unification fight. Forget the politics and whatever rubbish – let’s just make this fight. It is the biggest fight out there for both men. On the up: Scott Quigg (left) and Carl Frampton are destined to meet in the super-bantamweight division . I have spoken sporadically to the McGuigans over the past six months. When our guys get their next fight out of the way, we need to sit down together, lock ourselves in a room and not come out until it is agreed. This is a fight the public must see. Josh Warrington has signed a five-fight deal with Matchroom Boxing and I am delighted. This guy is one of the best talents in British boxing. He is 23 and already the Commonwealth and British champion, winning all 18 of his fights. Next up he is against Davide Dieli for the European belt on October 4 in Leeds. Believe me, this guy is one of the best ticket sellers in the business. He reminds me of a young Ricky Hatton in that respect. When it comes to sales, you tend to have box office sales and sales done by the fighter. This guy sells more than 2,000 himself to his fights. That’s an incredible amount. The best thing is, he delivers most of them in person! He’s a top fighter and a good guy. Star attraction: Josh Warrington is proving himself to be a big talent... and a big ticket seller .","I can reveal Carl Froch is likely to fight James DeGale in a huge all-Brit world title fight .

"Martin 'Mad Dog' Allen returns with the latest instalment of his weekly column for MailOnline Sport. The Barnet boss does not hold back with his views on current issues in football. I was so proud to be English on Saturday night in a small café on the high street of Ouagadougou in Burkina Faso. I think our England team was superb. Roy has changed and evolved from his days at Fulham and West Brom to play an open, more expansive style of football to go through Steven Gerrard in the middle and keep the passing on the grass. After his successful time at club level playing deep with two solid banks of four, I wondered whether Roy could change to suit a more open, expansive, possession-type game or stick with the old England way. At the final whistle I was disappointed sat there in my England shirt but I must say I was very proud of them and I think Roy deserves a lot of praise. Cheer up Roy! Hodgson deserves praise for the way England played, despite the defeat . At this level with teams parking the bus and playing the formation 10-1, you have to have full backs with pace and quality going into the final third. But on Saturday night Leighton Baines and Glen Johnson never had the quality to penetrate and unlock the door. Baines was steady in possession but was unable physically and athletically to get into the final third. Johnson got into the final third but technically, sadly for us, he is short. Roy will continue to play both these full backs but there will be a strong argument to pick the pace of Luke Shaw and the better technical ability of James Milner, but that would be a gamble. Falling short: Neither Glen Johnson (left) nor Leighton Baines (right) could influence the match against Italy - there is surely an argument to bring in James Milner (below left) and Luke Shaw instead . What a questionable, diabolical decision to award that penalty to Brazil? Croatia were comfortable and not under any threat and, with all the shenanigans of the World Cup votes going to Qatar, it certainly does make you wonder... With more and more teams parking the bus, it’s getting more difficult to score from open play. Now teams get everybody behind the ball and defend in the 10-1 formation that Fabio Capello talked about. He was speaking at an FA coaching course two years ago and he looked and smiled as he described the new formation, but I think he had it right. The mind-set is to defend deep, don’t let teams get behind you, get wide players to double up with the full backs and use deep central midfielders to screen the defence. We’ve seen similar at Chelsea with Jose Mourinho using David Luiz and Cesar Azpilicueta in midfield against Atletico Madrid in the Champions League, but it didn’t work. But with that defensive mind-set, set pieces become important. Super set-piece: Claudio Marchisio scored for Italy after Andrea Pirlo cleverly stepped over a corner . On Saturday England had nine corners but the Italians were first to every one. England never looked like threatening the first ball in the Italian box. Instead it was the craft and skill of the Italian coach Cesare Prandelli that proved to be decisive. Italy’s masterful short corner led to the first goal, with a quick pass to the edge of the box ‘through’ Andrea Pirlo finding Claudio Marchisio to smash it home. Spain were 1-0 up and cruising, dominating possession, shifting the ball along the grass with pace and precision. It was mesmerising and the Dutch could not get near them. And then David Silva strikes but, without a defender in sight, the keeper palms it wide from only 10-yards out. It would have been 2-0 Spain and three points in the bag. Within a minute of his miss the Dutch equalised through RVP and now it looks like RIP for Spain. Turning point: David Silva missed this chance to make it 2-0 to Spain - then Holland went and equalised... This week I have been in Burkina Faso with the charity Coaching for Hope. Organised through the League Managers Association, we have done five days of coaching, helping the local coaches in the villages around the capital Ouagadougou. Always boiling hot, the whole city is covered in an orangey, dirty dust like something from a Star Wars movie. It’s the third poorest country in the world but the local coaches are rich with enthusiasm. There is so much energy and willingness and the men and women taking part have the biggest smiles all day every day. They travel so far on motorbikes, if they’re lucky, pushbikes or just plain walking to get here. And we’re talking about miles and miles and miles. But their smiles and their happiness is so powerful. These people have no money but they are still so rich. I had the shock of my life at 7.30am one morning waiting for the Coaching for Hope jeep to take me to the national stadium to start my day. Leaning against the wall in the shade and, oh my God, right by my right elbow was a lizard as long as my arm. It ran past me missing my shoulder by inches and, I must confess, a visit to the loo was essential.","The way Roy Hodgson's men played made me proud .

"With just over a week to go, one of the most highly-anticipated all-British fights draws closer and the physcological battle which fans love to see hotted up when Nathan Cleverly and Tony Bellew were pitted together on The Gloves Are Off this week. Many feel that Bellew is spiralling out of control and worry if he can hold together, not just on fight night but on fight week. I know how much this fight means to him; it's a fight he's asked me for ever since he joined our team. You do have to be careful in this sport not to burn your nervous energy in camp and at the big media events so that you can give it all on the night. Nathan on the other hand is as cool as a cucumber, locked away with his trainer Darren Wilson. He's calm and ready for the strenuous media activities and the fight itself. Tony Bellew is fired up for his re-match with rival Nathan Cleverly in Liverpool on November 22 . Cleverly and Bellew went head to head on Sky's The Gloves are Off show . Bellew has made no secret of his dislike for Cleverly in the build up to the fight . Everyone's got an opinion but the fact is, no-one really knows who is going to win and that's what makes this fight so intriguing. Many feel that Tony has moulded into the better, stronger cruiserweight. Can Nathan hold up to his shots like he did that night when he defended his WBO light-heavyweight title? Can his work rate and technical ability overcome Tony in a fight which is now surely about pride and ego than precision and technique? Promoting both fighters is a difficult situation for me; I'm very fond of both of them. All I can do as a promoter is give them the best opportunities and when they meet on November 22, it's just a case of may the best man win. It would be tough for me to give an opinion on who I believe will be victorious. The honest truth is, I just don’t know and I'll sit there just as intrigued and excited as you when the opening bell sounds at the Echo Arena. Bellew and Cleverly almost came to blows when they fought on the same bill earlier this year . I've been involved in some big grudge matches over the last couple of years but I've never seen a hatred so deep from a fighter than that of Tony towards Nathan. He has spent many nights with Nathan on his mind, not just in this camp but after the first defeat. I also don’t think I've ever seen a fighter want victory as much as Tony does whereas the dislike from Nathan towards Tony is not as intense, it's more about the will to win and ending the noise and this chapter of his career. Cleverly is keeping cool and is determined to win for the second time against Bellew . While this is an official eliminator for the WBO cruiserweight world title, its about so much more than that. I'm not sure how Tony would handle a defeat, bearing in mind his emotional intensity going into the fight. I've had plenty of tweets warning me to be on my toes at the weigh-in and press conference next week. The fact is, this is two men about to walk into an arena of 10,000 people wanting to see a war. Lets be honest, it's not normal; these are not normal people. These are special people in a special sport. But we have to remember we have a code of conduct to follow. Both fighters are role models to the younger generation. There will be of course be drama and intensity next week but both fighters, despite the rivalry, are real professionals and will remain a credit to the sport. Cleverly and Bellew almost came to blows back in 2011 ahead of their first fight . Cleverly beat Bellew in their first fight back in 2011 and seemed to show respect to each other afterwards - but the relationship has got worse in the years since . The undercard has grown into one of the strongest I've ever seen. George Groves, James DeGale, Scott Quigg, Anthony Joshua, Jamie McDonnell and Callum Smith are all in major fights and with so much on the line, it's going to special night for British boxing. I wish we had 30,000 tickets to sell because as it draws closer, this night gets bigger and bigger. It has all the feel of a British super fight. Rivals James DeGale and George Groves both feature on the undercard of the Bellew vs Cleverly rematch . We return to Dublin after many years and I cannot wait to feel the atmosphere insider the 3Arena on Saturday night. I think people overlook the challenge of Jorge Sebastian Heiland but this is a proper fight for Matthew Macklin and without doubt his career is on the line on Saturday. Sebastian comes as the WBC International champion and this fight is an official eliminator with the winner firmly fixed on a possible Miguel Cotto clash next spring. Matthew will need to draw on all his experience and desire and all the energy of the 5,000-strong crowd to ensure he gets over the line. Heiland loves to come forward, throws plenty of punches and doesn't take a step back. We all know how Matthew likes to fight; expect a classic in Dublin. Matthew Macklin returns to the ring this weekend to fight Jorge Sebastien Heiland in Dublin . At this stage of his career, when he's been in so many big fights, many will question his desire but Matthew is in great shape and desperate for another shot at a world title. Saturday will provide all the answers we need. We've added a number of new destinations to our fight itinerary and Dublin is one that I'm very excited about. Especially the big grudge match between Spike O'Sullivan and Anthony Fitzgerald as well as the Irish debut of top amateur John Joe Nevin. Our very own Anthony Crolla, Kal Yafai and Sam Eggington are also in action. Expect a big announcement regarding one of those three early next week. Spike O'Sullivan will fight rival Anthony Fitzgerald on Saturday in Dublin on the undercard . Kal is now well and truly back in the groove. He looked devastating on the Groves bill and has a tough assignment against former world title challenger Everth Briceno who will show us where Kal is at. On the subject of all-British fights, surely a fight between Kal and Paul Butler is just around the corner? I was absolutely delighted to welcome Bradley Saunders to the Matchroom team this week. He's made major waves in the last 12 months, moving swiftly to 10-0 with eight knockouts. The people in the North East are genuinely excited about Bradley and the thought of Matchroom staging major events in the region. He will box on the huge Liverpool bill on Saturday week and again in January before headlining his own show in Newcastle on April 4. To be honest, I cannot wait. Bradley Saunders is welcomed to Matchroom by promoter Eddie Hearn in Newcastle . The North East has been a target of ours for a long time. Now we have the perfect excuse as Bradley joins what is, in my opinion, the best promotional stable ever assembled in world boxing. Frank Warren this week lost his £2m claim against Ricky Burns. The Judge dismissed his claim as 'fanciful' and said that it bore “no relation to reality”. Ricky is owed £102,000 of his purse money from FW promotions (now in administration) and he will now pursue matter with the British Boxing Board of Control. The full judgement from Mr Justice Knowles can be found in the article HERE.","Tony Bellew and Nathan Cleverly must handle the emotions of fight week and the fight itself .

"Tyson Fury is back on form on Twitter. He loves a good Twitter rant, this time calling out Anthony Joshua for a fight. It's great news for us that the leading domestic heavyweights are realising that AJ is the 'money' in the division and even though that fight won't be next, I can certainly see it happening in 2015. You know how I feel about that fight - Anthony would destroy him. But I give Tyson plenty of credit - he is a talented young fighter with a wicked sense of humour! About 90 per cent of people who replied to his rant on Twitter share that view. No one can see Fury taking a clean shot off Joshua, who I can reveal here will likely have a fight on January 31 at the O2 Arena in London. Anthony Joshua (left) in action against Russian Denis Bakhtov at London's O2 Arena earlier this month . Tyson Fury is back on form on Twitter and recently called Joshua out for a fight in December . Even though Fury has only fought twice in 18 months and has gone off the radar, we’d love to make the fight for AJ. The interest will be immense, but I think that is the case for all his fights at the moment. The public realise he is a special talent and I, as his promoter, know that very well. That is why we are doing everything right. We are picking the right opponents at the right times to enable him to grow as a fighter. David Price, another talented British heavyweight, is also keen and even though the British public see that as an easy night's work for AJ I believe it's a stern test, particularly at this stage of his career, but for all these guys there can only be one outcome - AJ by the big KO. As it happens, Joshua is destroying everything in sight. He is out next against Michael Sprott on November 22, which should hopefully provide him with his biggest challenge. Sprott is durable, as is Denis Bakhtov, but we saw what Joshua did to him last time out. We called Sprott after AJ beat Bakhtov to check he still wanted it. I think he was offended. He is training hard and has already told me to make sure I pay him well for the rematch! We are confident for another impressive win but anything can happen in heavyweight boxing. Then I hope to put him on a show at the O2 on January 31. Kevin Johnson is a name that's been touted. Surely he can give AJ the rounds? After that, bring on the Brits. In Fury, Price, Chisora and David Haye there is a pathway of excellent fights and I want, as a fan, to see them all. I am still working on making a fight between Carl Froch and Julio Cesar Chavez Jnr. I think it’s the only fight at the moment that would motivate him to go back into a training camp. To make it, Chavez has a few issues he needs to resolve with his promoters, Top Rank. If they can do that then it is my job to deliver this fight for Carl. Obviously James DeGale was hoping to fight Carl, but he must now focus on his November 22 fight against Marco Antonio Periban. That’s a tough fight and I give James massive credit for taking such a big test when he is already mandatory. Assuming Carl vacates his IBF super-middleweight world title, DeGale as the mandatory challenger will then fight for the belt in early 2015. DeGale as a world champion – I can see that appealing to Carl. Summer 2015 at Wembley for a unification fight? Let’s wait and see. Carl Froch lifts his arms in the air after defeating George Groves at Wembley Stadium back in May . VIDEO Carl Froch v George Groves highlights . James DeGale celebrates after beating Brandon Gonzales in the fourth round at Wembley on May 31 . The November 22 show now features George Groves fighting against Denis Douglin. I see this as a massive banana skin for Groves. On paper he should be comfortable. But I rate Douglin close to Christopher Rebrasse, who took George the distance in his last fight. For Douglin, this is his big chance to make a name for himself. For Groves, you have to wonder how driven he is after what happened against Carl at Wembley. Douglin is certainly confident, judging by his comments. He’ll be looking to take Groves into the second half of the fight so he can see how much Groves wants it. Groves needs to be careful. Brit George Groves (right) takes on France's Christopher Rebrasse at Wembley Arena last month . I love a top-level domestic fight, I think they are special. When the two guys are from the same city then you have something unique. I think that is what we have in Tommy Coyle and Luke Campbell in Hull. It is a great fight city. I have taken four shows there following the one at the weekend and they are getting better and better. The people there realise they are fortunate to have two world-class lightweights on their doorstep and those same fighters are on a collision course for a huge fight in the summer. The way they both handled themselves on my Hull show at the weekend was perfect. Coyle pulled off a stunning knockout against the brilliant and well-prepared Michael Katsidis. Katsidis spent seven weeks over here preparing but had no answer to Coyle. Tommy Coyle celebrates after winning his fight against Michael Katsidis at Hull Ice Arena on Saturday . Coyle has made a name for himself in his own right. People thought he would fade away a bit after losing to Derry Mathews last year, but he has been superb since coming back. Campbell, meanwhile, is an Olympic champion-turned-world champion in the making. I am certain of it. He has done so much in so few fights. I think he will be a star at this weight and win another title in the next division as well. Campbell versus Coyle is a fight I have already started working on. Craven Park and the KC Stadium are both interested in a summer fight. The date of May 30 at the KC Stadium has been discussed but it might clash with rugby, so we are considering alternatives. I want them both to fight again in February or March and then it’s the big one. Luke Campbell poses for the cameras following his win inside five rounds over Daniel Brizuela in Hull . All the indications are that we might finally see Floyd Mayweather and Manny Pacquiao get in the ring together. About time. Like all fans I’ve found it infuriating that the two best fighters never went in the ring. Now it looks like it will happen. It’s a couple of years too late for my taste but it’s a fight we all want to see anyway. I think Floyd realises that this is the only major box office draw left. I don’ t see him fighting Amir Khan and none of the other names are particularly interesting. A fight with Pacquiao is worth mega money and it’s a fight I think he wins. If they had fought four or five years ago I think it would have been close with Floyd edging it. I think he will win more comfortably if they fight next year. For now, I just want to see it happen. Floyd Mayweather looks on during his fight against Marcos Maidana at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas last month . Manny Pacquiao trains during a media workout in Hong Kong on Monday ahead of his WBO title fight . We are deep in talks for two of our top fighters to challenge for the world title, one here and one in Europe. Expect these in January and February and also expect more world champs for Britain. Details soon.","Despite Tyson Fury's Twitter rant, a fight with Anthony Joshua won't happen until next year .

"Click here to read Nasser Hussain's thoughts on the tragic death of Phillip Hughes and cricket's reaction . We’re all shocked by the news of Phillip Hughes’s death. Sport can be dangerous, but it’s not supposed to end like this. You just can’t make any sense out of it. I’m just desperately sad for Hughes’s family and friends, and for the whole of Australian cricket. I hope the feelings of the lad who bowled the ball, Sean Abbott, aren’t forgotten. I’m sure he won’t be – there’s a good support network around players these days. But it will be a hard thing for him to come back from. I remember the incident with Peter Lever and Ewen Chatfield during a Test in Auckland in 1975. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Flags fly at half mast over Adelaide Oval . Phillip Hughes's death was shocking and tragic, after he was hit on the head by a bouncer this week . The left hander celebrates reaching his century in a one-day international against Sri Lanka last year . Sean Abbott (centre) leaves the hospital on Thursday and is consoled by Simon Katich (left) It was at the end of an Ashes series in which me and the other England batsmen had taken a terrible pounding at the hands of Dennis Lillee and Jeff Thomson, and I’d gone home before the New Zealand leg of the tour. But Peter, who was a team-mate of mine at Lancashire, had hit Chatfield on the head in the days before helmets. Chatfield collapsed and swallowed his tongue. He had to be resuscitated by the England physio Bernie Thomas, who said his heart had briefly stopped beating. Technically, I suppose you could say he was dead for a few moments. Mercifully for everyone, Ewen pulled through, but I always felt Peter was never the same bowler after that. He was a thoughtful chap, and the fact that Chatfield came so close to dying was tough for him to deal with. This tragedy is just desperately sad for Hughes’s family and friends, and for the whole of Australian cricket . Ewen Chatfield is hit on the head by a Peter Lever delivery - Chatfield survived, but Lever was never the same . Abbott was warmly embraced by team-mates and cricketers at St Vincent's Hospital on Thursday . The Australian Cricketers' Association said they were monitoring Abbott and would offer support . Next summer during a county match, we were playing on an uncovered pitch – and Peter just didn’t want to bowl. No one blamed him. He was really suffering, and he still gets asked about it today. He’s still uncomfortable about it now – and Chatfield didn’t even pay the ultimate price. So just imagine how young Abbott must be feeling. You just hope he doesn’t blame himself. Batsmen have better protection these days, and I don’t see this as being an issue about the safety of helmets. It was just a freakish accident. But how, as a bowler, do you deal with something like this? How can you ever love the game again? My heart goes out to Sean Abbott.

"The first time I saw the young Jimmy Anderson bowl, in a televised match for Lancashire, I turned to the Sky producer and asked if the speed gun was working properly. He assured me it was. It said he was bowling at 90mph. Back then he used to just bowl as fast as he could. Since then, Jimmy has become an artist — and has answered every question posed of him. He put them to bed; Anderson can only bowl in English conditions, it was said. It has to swing for him to prosper, it was said. Now he is rapidly approaching Sir Ian Botham’s English Test wicket record and has the capacity to go well past 400 wickets. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Captain Cook focused on series win . Performer: James Anderson is closing in on Sir Ian Botham's English Test wicket record . Flying high: The Burnley Express has been scintillating against India during this series . VIDEO Captain Cook focused on series win . Jimmy is a typical Burnley lad. Burnley folk tend not to speak until they’re spoken to and they weigh up strangers before deciding whether they are worth talking to. They have a dry sense of humour. Duncan Fletcher once said to me: ‘What can you tell me about this lad Anderson? He never says anything.’ I said: ‘Fletch, you played in the Lancashire Leagues just up the road. You know what they’re like!’ All of which makes Jimmy’s attitude on the pitch such a contrast. To me, he is just like Glenn McGrath. But Jimmy does not get sidetracked if he loses his rag with someone. It fires him up. Anderson has come a very long way from his Burnley days. And maybe sometimes, like at Trent Bridge this season, he really does think of himself as the Burnley Lara! Consider the best fast bowlers England have had and you think of Fred Trueman, Botham and Bob Willis. Well, Anderson is right up there with them and I’m thrilled for him. I imagine Jimmy is a captain’s dream because he just gets on with his job. All power to him. He's up there with the best ever !

"Total fights 35 . Wins 33 . Wins by KO 24 . Losses 2 . Draws 0 . Having spent a lot of time with Carl Froch recently, it's been difficult to ignore his burning desire to box in Las Vegas. As we all know, anything can happen in boxing, but talks re-opened last week with the Julio Cesar Chavez Jnr camp and I am hopeful that a fight can be made in Las Vegas. For Carl, it has always been his dream to fight in Vegas so it is something we will try hard to finalise. It had seemingly died in the water, but I took a call from Top Rank on Saturday and they wanted to explore the possibilities further. I am now expecting to be on a conference call with Chavez’s representatives later this week where we will try to make more progress. Carl Froch, 37, is close to sealing the dream Las Vegas fight with Mexican Julio Cesar Chavez Jnr . Chavez Jnr after winning the WBC World Middleweight Title bout with Sebastian Zbik in Los Angeles . The 37-year-old has given thought to retiring since his stunning stoppage of George Groves in May . Should this fight go ahead, it will have a knock-on effect on James DeGale, who has earned the right to be mandatory challenger for Carl’s IBF super-middleweight world title. There are time constraints regarding Carl having to face James and if it's not possible then you could see Carl vacating that belt to free himself up to fight Chavez. It would be tough for Carl to do that because he knows better than anyone the effort that goes into winning a belt. But a Vegas fight is the guy’s dream – he desperately wants to fight at the home of boxing and if he gets the chance he will take it. If that happens, DeGale will fight for the vacant IBF belt in early 2015 with the winner likely to fight the winner of Froch and Chavez. That is a fight, assuming it is a unification between DeGale and Froch, which would fill Wembley next summer. Watch this space. As ever in boxing, there are plenty of twists and turns so nothing is certain. But I am more hopeful than at any time before that we can make Froch-Chavez. ........................................................................ Anthony Joshua shocked even me at the weekend with the way he took out Denis Bakhtov inside two rounds. Everyone around us in the O2 was left open-mouthed at what they saw. I’m convinced that only David Haye of Britain’s stellar heavyweights would match him if they fought today, but more of that later. One thing I think people saw on Saturday, as was mentioned in the recent Sportsmail interview with AJ, is that he properly enjoys beating up his opponent. He chases them down and just unleashes his strength on them. He is a brutal fighter. What next? He will fight Michael Sprott in November – if Sprott doesn’t get cold feet - and I think a fight with Kevin Johnson, the American who took Vitali Klitschko 12 rounds, would be good for early 2015. Then bring on the Brits in a series of huge fights. I would suggest he fight the loser of Dereck Chisora and Tyson Fury, then he can fight David Price in the summer. After that it would make sense to fight the winner of Chisora and Fury before a massive fight against Haye. For me, Haye is obviously a standout above the other British heavyweights. I think Joshua would beat the rest today. As for Haye, that would be a tremendous milestone and a huge fight, maybe for the end of 2015, when Joshua will be at world level. But no-one here is getting carried away. Joshua will earn those chances with hard work and more great performances. No-one is more level-headed or determined than him. He knows there is a path of great, high-interest fights out there for him. He needs to step up and do what he is doing and there will be more great nights.

Joshya gestures as he prepares to have his arm raised as the new WBC International heavyweight champion . David Haye lands a punch on Derek Chisora (left) during their fight in July 2012, his last competitive bout . Lee Selby also made a huge impact on our show at the O2 on Saturday. The Welsh Mayweather was given no more than a 50-50 chance against Joel Brunker, but barely lost a second of any round. He will fight IBF featherweight world champion Evgeny Gradovich before the end of March and who can see him losing? I can’t. He had a lot to prove in that ring. He was following a stunning performance from domestic rival Josh Warrington the week before and responded in perfect fashion. He is one of the most exciting talents coming through and has the good fortune of an excellent rival like Warrington. That is a fight a lot of people are asking me about and it is one I like a lot. When Selby beats Gradovich – and I’m sure he will – I’d like to see him fight Warrington at Elland Road in summer 2015. Lee Selby (left) dominated Joel Brunker (right) before winning in the ninth round at the O2 Arena in London . We have a wonderful show at Hull Ice Arena on October 25 and it is bringing Tommy Coyle and Luke Campbell closer together. Campbell, the Olympic champion, will fight Daniel Eduardo Brizuela and Coyle faces Michael Katsidis, one of the most exciting fighters of his time. Considering the incredible intensity of Coyle’s win over Brizuela, I think his fight with Katsidis could be one of the fights of the year. An incredible fight. People say Katsidis is slowing down but he has been sparring in England for five weeks and word is he looks very sharp. For Campbell, this is a tough, tough fight. Brizuela is a mile further along than his previous opponents and had a fight of the year contender with Coyle back in February. In each case, I see this fight as a perfect marker before a possible fight between Coyle and Campbell at the KC Stadium in Hull next summer. We had fun and games at a press conference in Dublin this week. We are taking a show there for the first time in years and cannot wait. Matthew Macklin will face Jorge Sebastian Heiland for the WBC international middleweight title in an official world title eliminator, while Anthony Fitzgerald will fight Spike O’Sullivan, Ian Tims takes on Michael Sweeney and Patrick Hyland is against John Simpson. It’ll be a great night in a city that deserves top-class boxing.

"David 'Bumble' Lloyd offers his observations from the ICC Cricket World Cup. This time the former England batsman talks free trams, Steve Smith's strange dinner date and England's expectations. CO-HOSTS WITH THE MOST . I’ve been here a long time already working on the Big Bash and the Tri-series and I can tell you that Australia are an awesome side. I’ve been camped up in the fantastic city of Melbourne for the past two weeks where one of the attractions is that the trams are free (in the city centre) - which I’m sure will appeal to Nasser Hussain... Australia, here celebrating a wicket in their final warm-up against UAE, look to be an awesome side . Melbourne's trams are free of charge in the city centre, a cost Bumble says appeals to Nasser Hussain . SMITHY IS BATTY . Bumped into Steve Smith - who led Australia so well during Michael Clarke’s absence in their recent Test series against India - in a restaurant with his partner and would you believe he had his bat with him? He almost left it behind! I nearly took it but eventually called out to his young lady: ‘He’s left his bat!’ Aussies seem to take their bats everywhere. Run machine Steve Smith has such a close connection to his bat that he takes it out for dinner . COME ON ENGLAND! What about England? They’re not favourites but they are working their nuts off and reaching the semi-final would be a good effort. In their last game, against Pakistan, they hit only 250. Must do better. But all I can say is: ‘Come on England! And Scotland and Ireland, too.’ Eoin Morgan's England aren't favourites and it would be an achievement to reach the last four .","ICC Cricket World Cup co-hosts Australia are an awesome side .

"Watching Kell Brook win his world title against Shawn Porter on Saturday night ranks right up there with my best nights in this sport. It was just incredible. I have seen up close what he has gone through to get to this point. He has had world-title fights postponed and people have doubted his desire. They have asked whether he has the stomach for it and whether he has the hunger to be a champion. He has proved everyone wrong and shown just how special he is. He came of age in that ring and great things lie in wait for him, including Amir Khan. I am looking at next spring or summer in a fight, maybe at Wembley, that will be just as big as Froch-Groves. I’ve started talks on it, but more of that later. Stomach for the fight: Kell Brook (left) beat American Shawn Porter on Saturday . Blood sweat and tears: Brook (right) gets stuck into Porter in Los Angeles . Special: Brook and his corner go wild when he's awarded the win - now his target is Amir Khan . Before the fight against Porter, Kell was very quiet. I’d never really seen him like that - I felt he was very nervous but I was wrong. He was just totally calm, ready to go out and get what he has always dreamed of. It was pure focus. We had an hour chat in his room on the morning of the fight. I explained what victory would mean and how it would change his life. I told him he must not let this opportunity pass him by. That’s the beautiful thing about boxing - after all the training and all the years of dreaming, you’ve got 36 minutes to make it happen. I am a great believer in things happening for a reason and perhaps that is what happened with Kell when his world title shot against Devon Alexander was called off. Maybe it took missing that fight to realise just how much he wanted a title. He came back hungrier, desperate to get what he deserved. He trained so hard for this fight. He comfortably made the weight, which is all you need to know really for such a huge welterweight. And on the night he was brilliant. He put so much pressure on himself. In his head he was thinking his whole life led to that moment. I was saying the same to him in the dressing room. But he handled the pressure we all put on him so well. I was sitting with Oscar De La Hoya and he felt Kell won with ease. It was controlled, professional, brilliant. He executed every part of his gameplan. For me, he proved he is special – one of the absolute best talents in world boxing. Khan is suddenly very interested in a fight. We are too. People from Showtime, who show Khan’s fights in the US, came into the dressing room after Kell won and said ‘Let’s talk’. Other US broadcasters have also been on - it’s exciting times. I think this fight can be made, but people have to put arrogance and ego to one side. Before, when we offered Khan £3m to fight, he didn’t fancy it. Kell had a reasonable name and no title. He has a huge name and a world title now. We Khan't wait: The Bolton boxer (right) is very interested in a fight against Brook . Read Riath Al-Samarrai's exclusive  here . That changes the negotiating position a lot, but this is such a big fight everyone can do well out of it, so long as Khan doesn’t demand an unrealistic split we should make it happen. I want to make this fight and I think it will be huge. Maybe Floyd Mayweather will feature down the line. Kell is certainly in that reckoning now. Kell is next out on December 6 in Sheffield and we will now start looking at opponents. Andre Berto, Juan Manuel Marquez, Brandon Rios, Josesito Lopez are all names being thrown in the pot but it is very early days. We will talk over the options and go from there. Kell has a great future and I am so happy for him. The next big thing: Brook vs Khan could be just like Froch-Groves (left) - and Floyd Mayweather could lie in wait . Joshua sparring with the best . Anthony Joshua had a call to go sparring with Wladimir Klitschko and he is out in Austria now. I discussed it with him and said he simply had to go. Wladimir is one of the greatest heavyweights in history and the best of his generation. This is a wonderful opportunity for AJ to see how the best do it – how they live, eat, train. He will gain a huge amount from this experience. I am looking forward to a progress report as I’m sure Anthony can hold his own. Expect him to look sensational on September 13 at the Phones 4 U Arena. Smith vs Groves would be a highlight of next year . On Kell’s fight card in the US, there were great wins for Callum Smith and Luke Campbell, two of the best prospects in world boxing. They keep destroying whoever I put them in with. For Callum, he will next fight on October 4 in Leeds but I can reveal here that a fight I have one eye on is against George Groves next Spring or summer. By George: Callum Smith (left) beat Abraham Hernandez on Saturday and could fight Groves next year . Groves is making his comeback in September and I think a fight with Smith could be a highlight of 2015. Believe me when I say he will be ready. Campbell will fight on October 25 in Hull, on a card featuring Tommy Coyle. Both of them have big, tough fights that I will announce next week. Don't rule out a return to the ring for Kellie . It’s never dull in boxing, as demonstrated by Kellie Maloney and Audley Harrison going into the Big Brother house. Who knows what will happen next? Since wanting an apparent quiet life, Kellie was seen at a show in Germany last weekend and is now taking part in one of the biggest reality TV shows in the World. Could a comeback be on the cards?

I would like to pay my respects here to Glyn Leach, the editor of Boxing Monthly who died this week. He was a lovely man and did so much to help me in the early part of my career.

You just cannot get your bearings in the city centre. There are portacabins set up as shops and even banks. It will clearly take a long time for this place to get back up on its feet.

"As England take stock ahead of surely the defining match of this Six Nations against Ireland, my advice would be: ‘Don’t buy into the cliches. Don’t waste a second about what is meant to happen and how such a massive occasion is meant to play out. Just have the confidence to produce your A game, execute and win.’ Rugby is full of these cliches and they can get into your head. ‘You never know which French team are going to turn up’; ‘The Italian pack will always make life difficult’; ‘The South Africans will always out-muscle you up front’; ‘New Zealand run the ball from everywhere’; ‘The Australians can’t scrummage’; ‘Playing Ireland on a wet afternoon in Dublin is hell’; ‘You must silence the crowd in Cardiff’, etc. These expressions are redundant. Before the Wales game I was amazed that so many pundits talked up Wales, at home, as strong favourites with their phalanx of great Lions from 2013. Absolutely meaningless. Jonathan Joseph is congratulated after scoring during England's 47-17 victory over Italy at Twickenham . Joseph escapes the clutches of Italy's Leonardo Sarto as England make it two wins from two at Six Nations . England's win was marred by a concussion injury to Mike Brown, although he should return against Ireland . England skipper Robshaw shakes hands with the bruised and battered Italians after the match . I looked at the two teams and asked myself how many of the Wales players would make a Lions starting XV on current form and there weren’t many. From the off, I was convinced England, injuries or no injuries, would win. Before the Italy game I got some stick and was accused of arrogance because I insisted that victory was a given and England should look to score 50 points against the Italians, a team I have a lot of time for and who have an important role to play in the Six Nations. I just looked at the two line-ups on the day and assessed what should happen if England hit their straps. In the end England clocked up 47 after a patchy start and should probably have scored 25 more. The next step for England — who are beginning to excite us with their development and ambition — is for them to have total confidence in their ability and ignore all these old stereotypes. They are good enough now to shape the game themselves. Rugby at this level is about spending 85 per cent of your time on what you do — put the result in your own hands and let the opposition worry about how you are going to play. Anthony Watson scored his first international try as England come from behind to beat Wales in their opener . England players celebrate at the full-time whistle after a brilliant 21-16 win against Wales that surprised some . England's Mike Brown consoles Alex Cuthburt of Wales after victory at the Millennium Stadium . More will be written and said in the next two weeks before the game in Dublin than for any rugby match in a long time. Outside the England bubble, rugby fans can lap it up. But inside the England camp, just keep it factual and focus on your game plan. Ireland are a very good side with many world-class players — notably Jonny Sexton and Paul O’Connell — and an extremely astute coach in Joe Schmidt who is one of the very best and is loving this role. Ireland are very fit — they demonstrated that with how they soaked up French pressure in the final quarter —they keep it simple and with Cian Healy returning and Sean O’Brien back in the groove they will be at full strength when England arrive. Why they are at full strength and England still have players missing has been well documented in these pages. Ireland demand total respect but, on current form, more England players would get in the Ireland team than vice-versa. England have a better scrum and line-out and can win the battle at the breakdown. The England backs have been earning most of the plaudits but it’s time for the pack to take centre stage again. England and Ireland are both on an upward curve and have real momentum. For England this match is exactly the kind of game they will have to negotiate if they are to reach the World Cup final. Any win in Cardiff or Dublin is a great victory but, if we are serious about becoming the best team in the world, they are results that England need to become comfortable with and expect of themselves. They need to carry the mind-set: ‘We are England and we will win this game.’ This is not arrogance, this is the mind-set of champions. The Federers, Bolts, Redgraves, Adlingtons and Hoys of this world. Ireland defeated France 18-11 in Dublin to notch up a ninth consecutive victory on Saturday . Ireland head coach Joe Schmidt (centre) is one of the very best in international rugby . Ireland have a potential match winner in fly-half Jonny Sexton who has returned after a 12-week lay-off . I would ease down on the training in the build-up, even though the temptation is to work the team hard. Less is sometimes more. I would have plenty of walk-throughs but the priority must be to keep everybody sharp mentally. I wouldn’t be afraid to tweak a winning team. Again we wait on fitness reports on Courtney Lawes because he is always an England starter for me if fit but Stuart Lancaster must be reassured how well Dave Attwood and George Kruis have been doing, so it’s not an issue. Ireland will use Sexton’s kicking game to attack England’s back three so England must address that in training and it will be complicated by whether Mike Brown passes his concussion protocols. England will want their best footballing back three on the park and Brown, if fit, and Watson clearly start but there might be a debate around Jonny May, who is more of an out-and-out wing. That debate is fair enough but against Ireland I would only consider bringing somebody in if they add something to the mix and have a superior defensive and kicking game to May — given how organised Ireland’s catch, kick and chase game is. I’m not sure there is anybody who fits that description. Finally, are England becoming slow starters? It would be easy to get distracted and misinterpret this. They went 10-0 behind to Wales and conceded an early try against Italy but I’m not sure a slow start per se is the problem. Against Wales they took the Welsh apart at an early scrum but Toby Faletau miraculously rescued the situation to create Wales’ try. England conceded early points against both Wales and Italy, but should not be labelled slow starters . Dave Atwood (c) has impressed in Courtney Lawes' absence, but England shouldn't fear making changes . Stuart Lancaster congratulates Joseph after the game ahead of a possible Grand Slam decider against Ireland . Against Italy, England didn’t get it right from the kick-off, passing the ball across the line looking for something to happen. No problem running the ball from the first whistle if it is on but against Italy it was not on and they took some time to recover. If in any doubt, play some phases and bang the ball straight back, put in an aggressive chase and start playing in the opposition half where you can start thinking about getting the scoreboard ticking, including drop goals very early. England need to be very alert tactically in those opening exchanges against Ireland — at kick-offs and re-starts for example. Don’t kick the ball deep and give Sexton an easy kick, go for the short option and contest every scrap of possession from the off. Get that England pack into the game as soon as possible. Above all, play in the present. Don’t give any thought to what has happened in the past and how Ireland matches with England are meant to unravel. Just play your game and the opposition. That is what champion teams do.","England followed up their opening Six Nations victory over Wales by defeating Italy 47-17 at Twickenham .

"First things first: the selection of Jack Nowell on the wing is an excellent call by Stuart Lancaster. He’s been playing centre for Exeter and will bring a great deal of footballing nous into England’s back line. To have three players in your back three who can play in any position is a massive advantage and England are getting stronger with every game. An in-form Nowell strengthens this team and Ireland coach Joe Schmidt would not have liked this change, which is great news! Jonny May would have been targeted in this game and Nowell’s positional play and greater defensive awareness should stand England in good stead against Ireland’s outstanding kicking game. It’s a good, positive selection. But this game will not be won and lost out wide on the wing or between the No 10s — Jonny Sexton and George Ford — as many are saying. It will be won by the forwards. James Haskell (centre) and Chris Robshaw (left) will be key men for England in Dublin on Sunday . England's forwards will be key to securing victory against Ireland in Dublin on Sunday in the RBS 6 Nations . The clash will not be won and lost out wide on the wing or between the No 10s, the pack will decide the game . Stuart Lancaster will have looked to his pack first and foremost - they are an under-rated group . When you get to the crunch games like this, any international coach will look to his pack first and foremost. You start by writing down the names of players No 1–8. Much has been written about the England backs in this RBS 6 Nations but they can only play the way they have because of the performance of an under-rated England pack. They are not household names but they have every chance of becoming so. What does it mean when people talk about winning the forward battle? How can one pack put pressure on another? Pressure can be created in many ways but the most important is the speed and intensity with which you operate. I hope Lancaster has spent the week eyeballing his forwards. Here are six indicators to see who is winning the forward battle. Lancaster has made an excellent call by picking in-form wing Jack Nowell in his side for the Dublin clash . George Ford will hope that England's forwards can help him to an easier ride against the Irish on Sunday . THE SCRUM . The nearer you get to World Cups, and the more important the games become, the more important the scrum becomes. If you don’t get it right you will lose. That is still the achilles heel of Australia and Wales, who are both in our World Cup group of death, and it will be a massive factor in this game. In England’s first game against Wales they conceded a try from the first scrum. Yet when you looked at it objectively, England smashed them in that scrum. It was a massive moment because, while England conceded, they gained a huge psychological advantage, continued to dominate that area and went on to win the game. Ben Youngs is key to disrupting Ireland's scrum, and needs to be all over Conor Murray at the base . England did not start well on the scoreboard but in the most important part of the game, they started brilliantly. England must look to disrupt at least a third of Ireland’s scrums and try to win 100 per cent on their own put-in. By ‘disrupt’ I mean the opposition scrum-half finds it difficult to get the ball away from the base cleanly. I want to see Ben Youngs  all over Conor Murray at the base of the scrum. England have a better front row and a better all-round pack of forwards, and they can gain the upper hand there. A dominant scrum will not allow the opposition to play how they want to. Youngs will be an important part of England's efforts to disrupt at least a third of the opposition's scrums . THE LINE-OUT . England must be looking to win at least 90 per cent of their own throw while disrupting 25 per cent of Ireland’s ball. They must play with variety in the line-out, not just in terms of numbers but in terms of where they throw the ball, to get Ireland thinking. They need to be doing the unexpected and executing everything faster than the Irish team are accustomed to. This will create pressure. Something we used to do - and if you watch the 2003 Grand Slam game vs Ireland you’ll see this - was delay kicking a penalty to touch until everybody knew the line-out call rather than making that call when everyone is assembled at the line-out. It meant that once the ball was in touch, everyone went quickly to the line-out. Winning at least 90 per cent of their own throw is important  and England must show variety at line-outs . Ideally, the England support staff will be ready with a second ball. Do not assume the ballboys will give you a ball quickly because they will have been told to slow everything down (we did the same by the way!) The hooker gets there as quick as he can and readies himself. The ball is thrown in immediately and you’re already playing quicker than the opposition can react. Get the Irish out of their comfort zone. They will want it slow but a champion team wants it fast. As hooker, Dylan Hartley will have to get to the line-outs as quickly as possible to throw in immediately . THE RESTARTS . I recently reread my notes from before the 2003 game and one of the things we highlighted was the restarts. We identified two guys, Mike Tindall and Ben Cohen, who were outstandingly athletic and good in the air. Every restart should be taken with the aim of winning the ball back, and with a kicker like Jonny Wilkinson we would look left, right or straight down the middle and use the accuracy of his kicks to give those great athletes a chance of reclaiming the ball. We want the ball so why just kick long? England need to avoid kicking to Paul O’Connell from restarts because he is so strong receiving. Instead, they must look for Ireland’s weakest receivers. Mike Tindall (centre) and Ben Cohen (left) were identified as options to reclaim the ball from restarts in the 2003 clash with Ireland due to the fact they were outstandingly athletic and good in the air . England need to avoid kicking to Paul O’Connell (left) from restarts because he is so strong at receiving . BACK-ROW MOVES . They seem to have vanished from the international game but they remain a vital weapon. Keep it simple and take the pressure off the backs by calling a back-row move. This is as simple as No 8 picks up, runs, passes to the scrum-half who feeds the full back — England have great talent in the backs so just give them the ball early and let them play. DROP GOALS . Just like back-row moves, England seem to have forgotten the value of drop goals. Forwards love them because, even when defences are on top, they provide a means to keep the scoreboard ticking, which is a must, especially away from home. Ireland’s defence is one of the best but they cannot defend a drop goal. It provides a massive lift and can be a real dagger to the opposition. Lancaster watches over England's training session at Pennyhill Park in Bagshot on Friday . THE CONTACT AREA . England need to bring some real pain to the contact area and let this Irish side know they are in a physical battle from the word go. A great win of Lancaster’s, often forgotten, was the victory in Ireland two years ago. It is forgotten because England got hammered in Cardiff a few weeks later but in that win in Ireland, the England pack were awesome. My favourite word at the moment is ‘grit’. Sheer, bloody grit will go a long way tomorrow. This England pack should relish the chance to show the world how tough they are. In forwards coach Graham Rowntree they have an excellent role model. Forwards coach Graham Rowntree is an excellent role model for England's work in the contact area . This England pack should relish the chance to show the world how tough they are under Rowntree . They must explode into the game and flood the breakdown with a minimum of three players in addition to the ball carrier in order to smash the opposition. It’s a strength of Ireland’s but I want to see England dominate them at the breakdown. I believe they can do that. England need to go straight through the middle of the Irish breakdown as often as possible because it provides a massive psychological blow. We used to call it ‘killer’ because of the damaging effect it had on opponents when they knew you had the physical and technical attributes required to just smash through them. It’s the ultimate pressure builder. If England can build pressure, they’ll win. Ford and Sexton will have a big impact but whichever fly-half is given the easier ride will emerge victorious. Over to the forwards. England’s pack will dominate this game - so they should win by five points. Johnny Sexton (left) and Ford (right) will have a big impact but are relying on the forwards to help them out .","England face Ireland as the RBS 6 Nations' unbeaten sides meet in Dublin .

"What a difference a week makes. This England team, through getting selection right, have become a team that anybody involved in sport should look forward to watching. The Italy game is one England are going to win, but I want to see them set even higher standards than we saw against Wales, based on the quality of player they have. England’s first game in the World Cup is against Fiji and I want them to use this game today to replicate that fixture, when they’ll need to not only win but win well. Bath centre Jonathan Joseph rises high to claim a high ball during England's captain's run on Friday . England scrum half Ben Youngs (left) will be looking to inject pace and tempo into his side's attack . George Ford gets through some kicking practice at Twickenham ahead of the clash with Italy on Saturday . Last year’s RBS 6 Nations Championship came down to points difference and it could be the same this year. But of far more relevance is that, with Australia and Wales in England’s World Cup pool, that group could come down to points difference as well. And I do not think England can win the World Cup unless they win their group because their route to the final will be so much more difficult if they finish runners-up. I want England to challenge themselves (a) to concede zero points and (b) set themselves a target of scoring a drop goal and three tries in each half. England should be challenging themselves to push towards 50 points. Based on what we saw in their opening game against Ireland this is one of the poorest Italian sides I can remember in the Six Nations, which is a great shame for the tournament. My belief that the next game is all that matters has not changed. But Stuart Lancaster, as head coach, still needs to consider the direction and growth of his team. This is a great way to ensure they are still under pressure. Wasps flanker James Haskell has added massive physicality and dynamism to the England back row . Ireland turned in an acceptable performance in a wet Rome last weekend. But in front of a Twickenham crowd which will be buzzing after last week’s win, England should demand more. I will be disappointed if they do not come out with the attitude that they’re going to put Italy to the sword. I was so impressed by England in Cardiff. It was a landmark win. The difference the likes of Anthony Watson, Jonathan Joseph, James Haskell and George Ford have made to the conservative, defensive-minded England we have seen is brilliant. This is the best England team we have seen since 2003. It does not matter how it happened, it is there now and Lancaster should be roundly applauded. Saturday’s game, at home, will be a different challenge. People expect England to win convincingly and that brings a different pressure. England need to play with pace and put speed on the ball and challenge themselves to maintain a level of performance all the way through. I expect England to start well but can they finish each half at full tilt? England coaches Stuart Lancaster (left), Graham Rowntree (centre) and Andy Farrell watch on at training . I remember in 2003 when we played Italy at Twickenham. We ripped them to pieces in the first half and racked up 40 points — but then proceeded to turn in one of the worst second-half performances I can remember on my watch. We finished the game feeling flat even though we still won easily. It was a huge eye-opener. Lancaster’s team need to be ruthless today. I’ve never doubted this group of players and I’m delighted with how the coaching team are growing. This was illustrated by the control England had in the second half in Cardiff, which is so important in Test rugby. England are overwhelming favourites today but Italy will raise their level of performance and it’s vital England up their level too. They need to set themselves objectives. Can they concede zero points? Can they score tries from different parts of the pitch? Conor Murray celebrates his try during Ireland's 26-3 victory against Italy in Rome last Saturday . Lancaster should challenge his starting XV to stay on the field for as long as possible. Players should be lifted out of their comfort zones. Italy will kick a lot and I would challenge the back three to launch counter-attacks and resist the up and under. Ben Youngs should avoid the box kick. He and the loose forwards should tap and go from their own half, keeping up the tempo. Joseph will have a day to remember on his Twickenham debut and, if England play at pace with a real determination to score tries, it will be a great day to wear the No 13 jersey. They showed in Cardiff some potent attacking potential and, though a year ago the coaches would have worried about their defensive frailties, they know now these guys raise their defensive game in the international arena. Danny Cipriani can make a huge impact from the bench if he is called upon against the Azzurri . Ford was terrific against Wales. He didn’t look flustered at all. I’m not even sure he broke sweat. It was a really telling last kick under pressure, but I’m also really happy they have Danny Cipriani on the bench again because he is a similar player whose mindset is to attack. Having that affects the rest of the team and Ford has the chance now to cement his place. I’d like to see the coaches stick with this side. I’ve no doubt this week’s training will have been fantastic. The win will have reinforced the mindset among the coaches that what they are doing is right and the players will be walking taller, feeling arrogance in a positive way. You can’t understate how important Cardiff was. Now they can look forward to a really good Six Nations and a good World Cup with a battle-hardened group of players and a forward pack that can go head-to-head with any side in the world. That game will stay with them as a defining game of 2015. They must build on that today. England have a chance of a lifetime coming up. They need to take it.","England should challenge themselves to score a drop goal and three tries in each half against Italy .

"England were terrific against Wales but if I was at their team meeting at Pennyhill Park on Monday morning the first thing I would do is stick the RBS 6 Nations league table on the whiteboard. It will show England third behind Ireland and France. England have turned an important corner but they have achieved nothing yet. They are always the team everyone wants to beat and that will go up another level after the win in Cardiff. England have won only one Six Nations Championship since 2003 so now is the time to step up another level. It’s time to be hyper-critical and reset their goals. In any sport what seems like the best win of your life at the time is often only a stepping stone to something much better and more significant. England's stars celebrate their win against Wales in the changing rooms after Friday night's brilliant result . The players celebrations were matched by head coach Stuart Lancaster's (centre) and his backroom team . I would also remind those who did so well against Wales that England now have a growing number of very talented players who have either been dropped or injured and will be busting a gut to get back into the team: the likes of Alex Corbisiero, Danny Care, Brad Barritt, Tom Wood, Owen Farrell, Geoff Parling, Kyle Eastmond and Christian Wade to name but a few. And that’s before you consider long-term injury victims Manu Tuilagi, Ben Morgan and Joe Launchbury. These guys will not be celebrating Friday’s win and will be redoubling their efforts to get back into the team. Against Italy you go with the squad that did so well against Wales although I would bring Courtney Lawes back if fit. That’s no slight on George Kruis, who did well, but Lawes is a big player for England and needs to be involved whenever possible. England centre Jonathan Joseph scored the decisive try of the game as they won 16-21 against Wales . Joseph (centre) is mobbed by his England team-mates as they celebrate his second half try against Wales . The great thing about Friday night in Cardiff was the hard-edged mental attitude and ruthless approach England displayed starting from the stand-off in the tunnel and ending with George Ford banging over a long kick to close out the game. Brilliant, it was a quantum leap for the future and with that approach England can achieve great things. Everybody expects them to beat Italy on Saturday and this could easily be a week in which the intensity in training and playing drops off 10 per cent. Wrong! This must be the week when everybody ups their intensity 10 per cent. I’d even take it further than that. I would challenge England to hit some easily measurable world-class standards against Italy. SET-PIECES MUST BE SLICKER . One hundred per cent scrum-possession from your put-in is a must. England achieved this against Wales and must replicate that against a strong Italy pack. In the lineout, 95 per cent possession on your own throw is the standard required. In Cardiff England were 81.8 per cent, which is good but not good enough. Italy have a strong lineout so this will be a genuine challenge. England's lineout possession percentage must improve, while there were too many soft penalties given away . Luther Burrell did well in most departments, but England's kicking strategy needs to change . TOO MANY SOFT PENALTIES . England conceded nine in Cardiff which is on the limit of what is acceptable. Three in the first half were needless and normally Leigh Halfpenny would have landed all three, not just two. Against Italy the world-class standard would be six and I would bring a professional referee into every session to make sure every player understands the law. CUT DOWN ON CHARGEDOWNS . Three chargedowns is at least two too many. England have no real kicking option at 12 — though Luther Burrell did very well in other departments — so Mike Brown and Anthony Watson, who are great kickers, should be made part of the kicking strategy to give Ben Youngs and Ford more options. DON'T FORGET DROP GOALS . Whatever happened to the drop goal? In 35 Tests under Stuart Lancaster England have kicked just three, an amazing figure. I can guarantee you somewhere along the line this year England will have to kick a couple of drop goals at crucial times. So let’s start working on that now. I would want to see three drop goals against Italy, doubling the total of the last three years. And let’s try to kick one in the first five minutes of each half. Fly-half Dan Biggar (second left) restored Wales' eight point advantage with a drop goal of their own . James Haskell (blue scrum cap) bounced back off the post protector at the Millennium Stadium on Friday . DON'T GET DISTRACTED . I would ban all talk of any other nation and indeed the Six Nations Championship generally, let alone the World Cup. The focus should be totally on producing a world-class performance against Italy. For this week nothing else in the rugby world matters. For those who stray consequences should be clearly spelt out to them. This team must continue to toughen up. IT'S AN 80 MINUTE GAME . I worked out many years ago that 90 per cent of all Tests between the top six nations in the world have a points difference of less than seven going into the last 20 minutes. So you want your top players on the park during the last quarter. How often do you ever see Richie McCaw substituted for any reason other than injury? I want England to start the game on Saturday with the mindset that everybody, barring injuries, will play the entire 80 minutes. They have the fitness and conditioning to do that. If England are leading by a big margin after 70 minutes I would accept you empty the entire bench to guard against injury. But not before then.","England have turned a corner but they haven't achieved anything yet .

"As an England ‘fan’, I’m still buzzing about that win over Wales, while the coach in me is trying not to get too carried away. There is no question, however, that the result was huge leap forward for Stuart Lancaster’s team - the night we started to see their World Cup team and gameplan take shape. What a start to 2015, which is Rugby Year. England were comfortably better than Wales and would have won by more save for a few errors. But most important of all, Friday was also the night we saw a sea change in England’s mindset and attitude and that’s what excited me the most. It was like seeing boys suddenly becoming men. It all started with Chris Robshaw and that stand-off in the tunnel before the game when he refused to lead England out until he got an assurance that Wales would follow within a minute. England captain Chris Robshaw (left) set the tone for the match with his pre-match stand-off in the tunnel .

Robshaw is congratulated by England forwards coach Graham Rowntree following Friday's big victory . James Haskell (left), Robshaw (centre) and Billy Vunipola worked brilliantly as a backrow triumvirate . 8.00pm: England, led by Chris Robshaw, leave their changing room and stand in the tunnel. 8.01pm: Meanwhile, in their half, the Welsh replacements line the corridor waiting for the arrival of their starting XV. Robshaw, not keen to cede the advantage to Wales by waiting on the pitch, stands his ground in scenes reminiscent of 2003 when Martin Johnson refused to move to accommodate Ireland on the red carpet in Dublin. 8.02pm: Referee Jerome Garces urges Robshaw and his side to take to the pitch. Mike Brown has a word with his captain but he is unmoved, ball under his arm. 8.03pm: The BBC cameras flick between disgruntled-looking Welsh substitutes and Robshaw, who stares straight ahead with unblinking focus. 8.04pm: Robshaw gives the nod to the panicking officials. Garces confirms if the Welsh don’t follow inside a minute, he has licence to head back to the dressing room. England leave the tunnel, on their own terms, and are greeted by boos from the crowd. 8.07pm: Two minutes after the scheduled kick-off time, Sam Warburton leads out Wales. 8.10pm: After two emotional anthems the game finally kicks off, five minutes late. England wouldn’t have been the first team to be left hanging out there for three or four minutes while Wales cranked things up and choreographed their big emotional entrance. They must spend days rehearsing all this nonsense. I loved that stubborn defiance even if some of my commentating colleagues thought it disgraceful! It was brilliant, great theatre but very significant. Let me assure you that all sorts of things kick off behind the scenes at Six Nations matches and you need to stand your ground. Otherwise you will get trampled over or even bullied. One of my concerns about this England team had been that they are just a bit too ‘nice’ and accommodating, which can win you friends but sometimes lose you matches. For example, they let others dictate the itinerary of their summer tour of New Zealand which left them without half of their best players for the vital first Test, which was always the key game. They are only now recovering from that. So, inwardly, I was cheering loudly when Robshaw played hardball and refused to make life easy for the Six Nations officials and TV people trying to hurry England on to the pitch for the scheduled 8.05 kick-off. There was more than a hint of Martin Johnson and memories came flooding back of Dublin 2003, when Johnno refused to move to the other side of the halfway line for the presentations with the Irish president. It’s what champions do. NO MORE MR NICE GUYS . Robshaw’s stance was absolutely justified as he sought assurance from the referee that Wales would be made to follow him out within a minute or he would take them back down the tunnel. And there was a bigger message there as well. ‘This is 2015, this is our year, we are England and we are not going to be pushed around. No more Mr Nice Guys’. England head coach Stuart Lancaster hailed his side's 21-16 win against Wales as the best of his career . Fantastic. That’s exactly the approach England must assume this year and I sensed a new bloody mindedness in their attitude on Friday night from one to 15. This was just brilliant and the essence of competitive sport. It was a huge night for Robshaw and he came through with flying colours. James Haskell and Ben Youngs were my main contenders for man of the match but the England skipper was just half a stride behind them along with Anthony Watson and Jonathan Joseph. He absorbed all the lessons and hurt from two years ago when England were humbled and made them into a positive. Robshaw led well and as a player he never falters, he goes the full 80 minutes and has an astonishing capacity for work. I have never doubted his place in the team, only his position, because I am sure he could go equally well at blindside or even No 8. But that debate is now over: openside flanker it is. England scrum half Ben Youngs controlled matters beautifully from the base against Warren Gatland's side . As for Haskell, his display at blindside is indicative of England’s new approach. Haskell is an aggressive, in-your-face player, the sort the opposition love to hate. He is pro-active and positive, whereas in the past England have been too defensive. With him and Robshaw in unison and Billy Vunipola going well for the full 80 -  the first time he has completed a Test, which again was a big statement - the England back row definitely outplayed their much vaunted opposite numbers. THE BATH CONNECTION . Behind the scrum it wasn’t error free but it looked much livelier and I applaud the fact that the young Bath trio of George Ford, Joseph and Watson were picked for what they can bring to England’s attack regardless of any perceived defensive frailities. When it comes to Test rugby, players invariably raise their defensive games anyway. The Bath boys were all rock solid in the tackle and Watson, as well as taking his try brilliantly, has the all-round defence you would expect from somebody who plays regularly at full-back. Bath wing Anthony Watson (left) scored his first international try for England in Friday's win . The 20-year-old is mobbed by his England team-mates after scoring against Wales at the Millennium Stadium . Watson and Mike Brown are developing a good rapport down the right and Joseph’s try is exactly what you would expect from a player with flair and a bit of X-factor. These young guns just need a platform. They are not miracle workers and they won’t produce magic every time, but give them enough possession going forward, over a period of time, and they will conjure up something very nice. Ford impresses me more with every game. He is not playing by numbers, England are letting him run the show and under intense pressure he produced a mature performance. That big match-clinching penalty at the end will have done his goal-kicking confidence a power of good. Players remember moments like that when they present themselves again. (From left to right) The Bath quartet of fly half George Ford, lock Dave Attwood, winger  Watson and centre Jonathan Joseph brought their excellent club form to the Millennium Stadium . MEDICAL MATTERS . Away from England for a moment, I was a concerned with the handling of two Wales injuries. Dan Biggar picked up a horrible bloody cut to his face and clearly need to come straight off and get the wound sorted with haemostats, stitched and bandaged up properly. Rhys Priestland was on the bench as a straight blood replacement and it was a nonsense delaying the game and trying to treat Biggar on the pitch. The referee should have insisted he leave the field of play . As for George North, to these eyes he clearly picked up a concussion in the second half after an accidental clash of heads with Richard Hibbard. The slow motion showed him go limp, which is usually the giveaway sign, and he looked very groggy. Yet he was allowed to continue. George North copped a boot to the face from Attwood in the first half and then appeared to be knocked out after a clash of heads with Hibbard (above) but, incredibly, the Welsh winger finished the match on the pitch . I welcome the news that the world governing body - World Rugby - are demanding a report from the WRU on the assessment of North during the game. He also suffered a kick in the head in the first half and went off for eight minutes. It’s not a matter of establishing any ‘guilt’ - if there is any - but we must make sure rugby has its protocols correct and we are implementing them properly. Unfortunately, rugby seems to believe it is leading in this area but still lags behind other sports in its approach to player welfare when it comes to injuries. There is nothing more important than an individual’s health and we have too many players getting injured now. Why?

"Poor Hugh Blake. It’s not really his fault; he’s just a young player trying to seize an opportunity, but his name and new status have stirred up a hornet’s nest. National eligibility is back on the agenda again, because it is in disrepute again. A mockery is being made of the spirit and concept of international sport. This column has repeatedly raged at a system which is too easily abused, but nothing has been done so the rage goes on. Hugh Blake in New Zealand colours but Vern Cotter has included him in Scotland's squad . Cotter's decision to include Blake in the Six Nations team has raised some eyebrows . Blake has been picked in Scotland’s Six Nations squad. The Kiwi flanker has Scottish grandparents, so he is a legitimate recruit to the tartan cause – now overseen by another New Zealander, Vern Cotter. But what feels so wrong in the case of this 22-year-old openside is that he has barely stepped off the plane from Auckland and has yet to even play a senior game for Edinburgh. His promotion comes at the expense of two established stalwarts of the pack, Kelly Brown and John Barclay. It invokes grim memories from yester-year of the ‘Kilted Kiwis’ and, in particular, Brendan Laney’s indecently hurried integration into the Scotland squad. He had barely cleared customs, whereas at least Blake has been around for a month or so before earning the country’s call. But the news of his inclusion provoked a social-media storm. Former Scotland captain Andy Nicol tweeted: ‘Can anyone tell me anything about Hugh Blake please? Not played for Edinburgh but picked for Scotland? I thought we had left these days long ago!’ Ex-Scotland Lions prop Peter Wright weighed in with: ‘A real slap in the face for Barclay, Brown and Grant. Who (is) Blake?!!’ Kelly Brown is one of the players to miss out on the Scotland squad while Blake has been included . John Barclay (left) was another who has missed out at the expense of Blake . In a sense, the fact that Blake is an unknown quantity is a red herring. What jars is that he has not served his time in the Scottish system before being earning Test recognition. The same can be said for Gareth Anscombe in Wales, but he has managed to play a handful of matches for the Blues before being picked to represent the land of his mother. Let’s be clear; coaches who work the system and players who chase the international dream far from home are not the ones at fault here. Those who run the game must make it harder to turn the swearing of allegiance to a shirt and a flag into a business decision. The powers-that-be have to defend the concept of nation versus nation, to stop it becoming a soulless contest between scouting networks and recruitment programmes. The way it’s going, why bother having Test rugby at all if it is destined to become a variation on the club game, where overseas players can be lured for the right price and the promise of elite-level exposure. If most teams are eventually multi-national, the whole point of the exercise has been lost. In its true form, international rugby is the pinnacle of the game but it is vital that it retains identity and integrity, even in an era when migration is so prevalent. World Rugby – formerly the IRB – can start with some simple but effective measures. Former Scotland captain Andy Nicol queried the decision by Scotland coach Cotter . The period for residency qualification should be extended from three to five years. In addition, family ties to another country should have residency requirements attached, so having a grandparent from that country reduces the qualification period to three years, and it could go down to one year if the link is provided by a parent. That way, a Blake-type scenario would be averted. A player should spend time – at least a modest amount – in the place that they wish to represent. That would give some credence to their inevitable claims to share the same passion for the country as the people they expect to support them. Wales coach Warren Gatland should be quite relaxed this weekend but his England counterpart, Stuart Lancaster, is likely to spend two tense days hiding behind the sofa, dreading more bad news. The exit from the European Champions Cup by Ospreys and Scarlets will please Warren Gatland . But for England boss Stuart Lancaster, most of his side will be involved in the next games . The demise of the two Welsh sides in the European Champions Cup, the Ospreys and Scarlets – allied to the fact that the Blues and Dragons are in the less-intense Challenge Cup – means that Gatland’s leading men have more chance of emerging unscathed from the pool-stage finale. Some can be rested and certain exiles in France simply won’t be selected, which helps subsequent Test preparations in Cardiff. Lancaster, meanwhile, knows that the vast majority of his squad will be involved in blood-and-thunder, high-stakes encounters. Clermont Auvergne v Saracens stands out, as does Northampton v Racing Metro. Leicester’s trip to Ulster is bound to be explosive, Bath have a win-or-bust revenge mission against Glasgow and Wasps square up to perennial challengers Leinster. Not much scope for taking it easy before the Test business ahead. The threat of further English casualties before their trip to the Welsh capital is worrying high. The vibrant transfer market continues to produce some fascinating moves. Player traffic between the major East Midlands clubs is a rare phenomenon, which makes Jamie Gibson’s decision to join Northampton from arch rivals Leicester so eye-catching. Jamie Gibson (centre) has chosen to leave Leicester and join rivals Northampton . The athletic flanker has been outstanding for the Tigers this season but he has opted to sign for the champions – the bitter enemy – which will be a sore point at Welford Road. It also increases the prospects of the injury-plagued Lion, Tom Croft, earning a new Leicester deal, now that his younger challenger has opted to depart. Gibson can certainly expect a lively reception on and off the field when he returns in Saints colours next season. Meanwhile, London Irish yesterday announced the capture of Lions wing Sean Maitland from Glasgow, while Gavin Henson is destined to join Bristol from neighbours Bath, as first reported by Sportsmail. Gavin Henson is set to depart from Bath and join neighbours Bristol . It won’t be long before Bristol will be able to field an entirely Welsh XV. In fact, they should apply for WRU funding, as an unofficial fifth region… . Yoann Huget has received a warning from EPRC, the governing body for European club rugby, for his shameful dive during Toulouse’s match against Bath last weekend. For those who missed it, a mild shove to the chest prompted the France wing to slump to the ground in theatrical fashion and lie there clutching his face. It was an appalling attempt to trick referee George Clancy into awarding his struggling team a penalty and was rightly ignored. Huget later apologised but, as previously highlighted by this column, the spectre of so-called ‘simulation’ continues to creep into rugby and must be stamped out with gusto. Yoann Huget (second left) goes down holding his face despite being pushed in the chest . Encouragingly, the RPA responded by acknowledging the growing trend for ‘play- acting’, with chairman Christian Day saying: ‘What we don’t want is a player to go down clutching his face, and a player to be sent off only for the replay to show he was play-acting. That’s when rugby’s reputation will go out the window.’ If the players’ own union is so alert to the danger, there is every hope it can be repelled. Last Word – The continuing saga of Manu Tuilagi’s blighted quest for fitness is becoming a concern and is having a major impact on the outlook for his club and his country. Leicester and England need their midfield wrecking ball. Without him, neither side are as effective. Such is the scale of Tuilagi’s attacking influence that he spooked the All Blacks as well as running through them at will when England crushed the world champions in December 2012. Manu Tuilagi's continued struggle for fitness is a problem for England and himself . That was the last time he played an autumn Test; he has missed the last two campaigns and now it has emerged that he may miss a second successive Six Nations due to a persisting groin problem. His last championship start was against Wales in Cardiff in March 2013 and months later another injury limited his contribution to the Lions’ cause. England had hoped to build their back line around the Anglo-Samoan force of nature, but that vision is proving sadly elusive. Tuilagi still has rough edges, but he breaks defences as few can.","Hugh Blake qualifies for Scotland through his grandparents .

"Discovery: Ian Kinnaird, 72, discovered he is effectively the 'grandfather of everyone in Britain' A DNA test on a Scottish pensioner has revealed he is a direct descendent of the first ever woman who lived on Earth 190,000 years ago. Ian Kinnaird, 72, discovered he is effectively the 'grandfather of everyone in Britain' after he paid £200 to take the test to trace his ancestry. Britain's DNA, the research team who carried out the test, said the result means that Mr Kinnaird is 'the grandson of Eve' - the very first woman. The test results showed that Mr Kinnaird, a retired lecturer who lives in Halkirk near John O'Groats, has a genetic marker, L1B1, that can be followed back all the way to an ancient African lineage that has never before been found in Western Europe. He has mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) which is passed through the female side is 30,000 years old and only two genetic mutations removed from the first 'black Eve'. Most men, the researchers say, have genes that have incurred around 200 mutations from the earliest humans. Mr Kinnaird also found that the YDNA marker on the male side of his genetic make-up is Scandinavian and he carries the same genes that is found in a quarter of all Norwegian men. He said: 'I have led an unremarkable life until now. 'This is a real gobsmacker. I seem to carry a gene from West Africa that arrived through the slave trade. 'I have been researching the links between the slave trade and Liverpool, the area where the female side of my family came from. 'Africa was part of my geography degree at Hull University in 1959, but i couldn't have imagined anything like this. Alistair Moffat, St Andrews University's rector and historian, and James Wilson, a geneticist from Edinburgh University, were responsible for setting up the national study and uncovering the startling results of Mr Kinnaird. Mr Moffat said: 'It is an astonishing result and means he could have been in the 'Garden of Eden'. 'It is further proof that even white Anglo-Saxon Protestants are descended from a black Eve. Ancestors: Mr Kinnaird's parents Tom and Winnie . 'This lineage appears in Africa, in Senegal, but has never been seen in north-west Europe. 'It is likely to have reached Britain through the arrival of slaves in Liverpool. 'A woman who might be called Eve and a man who might be called Adam really existed. 'Eve, the mother of us all, lived around 190,000 thousand years ago just as homo sapiens were evolving. Other women lived at the same time but only Eve's mtDNA survived. 'Adam also lived in central Africa, perhaps only around 140,000 years ago. Only his YDNA survived to father all of the male lineages on earth. The aim behind Britain's DNA is to try and make a 'family tree of Britain'. The nationwide study that has examined the DNA of 2,000 people from all over the UK has found that most participants' genetic markers date back around 3,500 years ago to the days of the earliest Britons, Vikings and even cave painters and hunter gatherers. The complete test results suggest 32 per cent of British men are descended from the original Britons, 12 per cent from ancient Germanic lines, 11 per cent are hunter gatherers and 7 per cent are ancient Irish.","Ian Kinnaird, 72, discovered he is .

"The influx continues apace. All the world wants a Kiwi — players and coaches. New Zealand’s export trade in rugby men is booming, with All Blacks the prized commodity. This week, two English clubs have taken the plunge in deciding to recruit from the most successful sporting team on Earth — with London Irish lining up prop Ben Franks and Gloucester finalising a deal for lock Jeremy Thrush. The Exiles have gone a step further and opted to put a Kiwi, Tom Coventry, in charge of their post-Brian Smith revival mission. New Zealand lock Jeremy Thrush is on the brink of joining Gloucester . Kiwi Tom Coventry (second right) has been tasked with leading London Irish . He will arrive from Waikato Chiefs with supreme credentials. As a former team-mate of Warren Gatland, he will be expected to emulate the Lions coach by prospering on this side of the equator, but a gold-plated Super Rugby c.v. is not conclusive proof of an ability to thrive in these parts. Tactics and conditions are markedly different. A Kiwi accent provides no guarantee of effective rugby wisdom this far from home, although that is often the awestruck assumption. Since the game turned professional, countless southern imports have failed to live up to their lavish billing. For instance, Gloucester are being superbly served by All Black prop John Afoa now, but scrum-half Jimmy Cowan, another who wore the silver fern with distinction, was unable to deliver the sort of red-hot performances worthy of his blue-chip reputation. Scrum-half Jimmy Cowan has failed to live up to expectation with Gloucester . Pick the right recruit from the far side and it can be a wondrous decision, as Harlequins have found with Nick Evans — likewise Exeter, with Dean Mumm. Perhaps Franks and Thrush will acquit themselves well and savour the hard knocks up front, as Brad Thorn is at Leicester. It might be that incoming forwards prosper more than box-office backs such as Rico Gear, who utterly failed to set the world alight for Worcester. Kiwi coaches are all the rage. Three of the Six Nations have them, as do two of the four Welsh regions, but they have to embrace cultural differences, as Gatland has done and as Wayne Smith did at Northampton years ago. Kiwi Warren Gatland has been a success as the head coach of Wales . Other New Zealanders have thought that their methods and philosophies could be applied here without modifications and they have been wrong. Mike Brewer’s bad- tempered reign at Sale encapsulated that flawed logic. So, best wishes to Coventry, Franks and Thrush, and to their compatriots who will surely join the northern migration. But they should be in no doubt — a Kiwi passport will ensure safe passage through customs, but not through the weekly maelstrom of the Aviva Premiership. An array of Premiership statistics for the season to date have highlighted why England will not wait a moment longer than necessary to select Nathan Hughes, when he qualifies on residency next year. In light of the grim news that Ben Morgan will be out for at least six months after breaking a leg, there has been a tide of support for Nick Easter to receive a recall, and he is certainly worthy of consideration based on prime form and enduring — perhaps unprecedented — influence. Wasps' Fiji-born star Nathan Hughes is in line for an England call-up once he qualifies on residency next year . But the data lays bare the impact of Wasps’ Fiji-born force of nature. Hughes has made 154 carries, second only to Thomas Waldrom of Exeter, and he is third in the ‘defenders beaten’ category with 42, behind two fellow Polynesian game-breakers, Sinoti Sinoti and Semesa Rokoduguni. When it comes to offloads, Hughes is behind Easter but not far — with 22 to the 36-year-old’s 23. Hughes is also joint top of the ‘turnovers won’ chart. He is making a profound impact and holding out for England recoognition is likely to prove a shrewd move. His time will come. Europe has Anglo-French accent . Clubs, regions and provinces resume European combat this weekend with the pool tables pointing to Top 14 and Premiership dominance of the quarter-final places. Saracens should have the firepower to take Pool 1 to the wire by beating Munster at home, while Bath can win in Toulouse, to throw Pool 4 wide open. Owen Farrell will be helping to steer Saracens to victory against Munster this weekend . Harlequins v Wasps is too close to call, but expect a reaction from Northampton against the Ospreys in Swansea after their grim defeat at Sale last weekend. Leicester are likely to snuff out the Welsh challenge tonight by beating the Scarlets. Leinster may be the lone Guinness Pro12 representatives in the last eight, which would leave the new tournament with a lack of variety. If the Dubliners miss out, it may well boil down to an Anglo-French Cup — which was meant to be the fall-back plan during their threatened breakaway, not the actual outcome. The last word . Of all the frustrations that Stuart Lancaster has to put up with as England head coach, surely the toughest to accept must be the vast gulf between Billy Twelvetrees in theory and Billy Twelvetrees in reality. The Gloucester captain is in danger of becoming the wasted enigma of the era. His performance in the Premiership encounter with Saracens last Friday night summed up what drives the national coaches to distraction, as he mixed flashes of effortless class with far too many chronic lapses. The England No 12 shirt is there for the taking if Gloucester's billy Twelvetrees can cut out the chronic lapses . Suspect decision-making has so often been his downfall and it was in evidence again at Kingsholm. England’s No 12 shirt is there for the taking, but Twelvetrees is not showing signs that he can take a firm grip on it. He has all the wide-ranging attributes that Lancaster sees in his ultimate vision for the position. At his best, he is the second receiver at inside centre who can help to ignite England’s back line, but without the addition of composure and consistency, his hopes of fulfilling that potential are destined to fade, which would be a desperate pity.","London Irish are lining up a move for New Zealand prop Ben Franks .

"This day was always likely to come; it was just a question of how soon. Sam Burgess is back in an England shirt again - this time in the code he is still hurriedly attempting to crack. When the Saxons take on the savagely-titled Ireland ‘Wolfhounds’ in Cork on Friday night, there will be all manner of Test players involved in what is, sadly, a rare ‘A’-team international match. In a World Cup year, so many fringe candidates for national service require these occasions to press their case, but most countries have dispensed with second-string sides - leaving a giant leap between the Under 20s and the senior ranks.

England head coach Stuart Lancaster will be in Cork to witness Burgess' Saxons debut on Friday night . Stuart Lancaster is going over especially to watch proceedings in person, and he will closely monitor the likes of Matt Mullan and Rob Webber in the front row, Matt Kvesic at openside, rising Exeter sensation Henry Slade at No 10 and two established Test wings in Chris Ashton and Marland Yarde. But so much of the interest and the intrigue building up to this fixture has focused on league convert Burgess, who has been on a crash-course in union at Bath. The RFU are alert to the fascination, given the way the Yorkshireman has been prominent in all their news bulletins about the game, while there is curiosity in Ireland about the visitors’ rookie inside centre with the superstar profile. It was the same in Toulouse earlier this month, where Burgess dominated discussions about Bath, before he was ruled out of the Champions Cup encounter. While there are countless cynics keen to pour scorn on his efforts to learn a whole new ball game in time to become a World Cup contender, the England management are not in that category. Burgess is firmly in their thoughts and while a strong performance on Friday night won’t thrust him into immediate Six Nations plans, he may be invited to join the senior squad to acclimatise to the surroundings.

The proud patriot is relishing his first Red Rose outing, saying: ‘It’s great to be representing the country again and I’m looking forward to it. You don’t get too many chances to sing the anthem so you have to make the most of it every time you have the chance.’ The Six Nations is not a target Burgess has in mind, as it has come too soon in his development phase. ‘I think it’s a bit premature,’ he added. Maybe it is, but on Friday night he can accelerate his second England career. Burgess (left) gives instructions and stretches during training for England Saxons this week .

When the official RBS Six Nations twitter account made its latest reference to ‘rugby’s greatest championship’ on Tuesday, the account for the southern-hemisphere Rugby Championship bit back. The riposte was a wide-eyed face with ‘*coughs*’ alongside. That was it; a subtle attempt to put Europe’s blue-riband event in its place. It was also fair comment. Every year, in these parts, we savour the thunderous tribal intensity of the annual neighbourly clashes, but purely in terms of playing standards, the SANZAR elite and Argentina deliver a superior product. In terms of the overall package; of atmosphere and colour, fervent cross-border tension and historical needle, not to mention the weekend festivals of revelry in the host cities, the Six Nations is top dog. But what it needs in this World Cup year is to deliver heightened, trend-setting on-field standards, tactical innovations and new peaks of athletic prowess. It needs Scotland and Italy to compete and it needs France to start equating to the sum of their parts again. If it has all of that and a fierce title fight, it can start using the ‘greatest’ claim with greater conviction.

With the two clubs destined for a two-leg showdown in the Championship Final in May, Robinson has ruled that Short’s decision to return to his home-town club means he is no longer welcome in the squad - for matches or even at training. ‘I need players who are 100 per cent committed in mind and body,’ he said. ‘I felt that a player who was going to a rival, who we are potentially playing in the play-off final, I thought was unacceptable. With the quality that we have in the side, he won’t be missed.’ Robinson has never sugar-coated his words, but even by his standards that is a blunt parting shot.

It’s a pub called The Stag. I didn’t actually know he was in there. There was a bar, a few stools and a fireplace there and I was 25 minutes early. I thought, “Well he is not here” so I went to the loo and ordered a drink, then he sort of appeared from around the corner.’ Asked what drink he had chosen, the Harlequins No 8 - without missing a beat - quipped: ‘I ordered a pint with a triple-whiskey chaser!’ Nick Easter has returned to the England fold - after meeting coach Stuart Lancaster at a pub in Ascot .

"The World Cup is fast approaching and the tournament promises to be an epic, glorious spectacle. Overall, the game is growing and is in good health, but here are five New Year wishes for rugby — based on fundamental domestic and global issues... On the home front, the Aviva Premiership has just enjoyed a glittering festive weekend which showcased its tribal appeal. There were full houses all around — including a crowd of 82,000 at Twickenham for Harlequins v Northampton, which was the biggest sporting attendance in the country. Television ratings are up, many matches are producing thrilling and explosive action founded on a large core of English talent, and the scourge of crushingly predictable results which afflicts many leagues has been largely avoided. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Stuart Lancaster lights up Rugby World Cup sign . The appeal of Rugby Union is strong, most evident with Premier League matches selling out at Twickenham . In the recent round of Christmas-cracker fixtures, five of the six games were settled by a combined margin of 23 points, but the exception to this photo-finish rule highlighted the major black mark against the Premiership’s good name. London Welsh lost 24-9 at London Irish, which was in fact a heroic triumph when taken in the context of their miserable season. The Oxford-based Exiles are doomed to a prompt return to the Championship, having already conceded 514 points in just 11 matches in the top division. That they are sadly out of their depth is abundantly clear and it paints the competition in a bad light, as the gulf needn’t be so stark. Harlequins and Northampton played out a thrilling contest infront of 82,000 fans at Twickenham last Saturday . Welsh receive just £1.5million in central funding, compared to the £4m which is handed out to their league rivals. This imbalance, which creates a horribly uneven playing field, is based on a convoluted shares system and has led to accusations from one MP that Premiership Rugby is operating a ‘cartel’, at the expense of promoted clubs. Either Bristol or Worcester will come up from the Championship at the end of this season and they are both handsomely funded, so the imbalance won’t have such a profound impact, but it should be addressed and changed nonetheless. The shares scheme is a throw-back to a newly-professional club game finding its feet, but PRL and its members have increasing TV revenue and gate receipts, so the funding should be universal, to remove this basic lack of sporting fairness. There has been a renewed debate about the merit of the salary cap in recent weeks, but instead of attempting to polarise the Premiership, the priority should be to support the weakest. Referee Greg Garner looks at replays on a screen . Officiating in rugby is in a mess — crippled by no-discretion edicts and uncertainty about how best to harness technology. This column does not possess the answers, but it can certainly highlight the pressing problems. There needs to be absolute, global clarity about the use of Television Match Officials and some common sense applied to the witch-hunt against ‘dangerous’ tackles, some of which are nothing of the sort. Referees must resume policing scrum feeds and forward passes (to hell with the nonsense about ‘momentum’, it’s either forward or it’s not), and further crack down on time-wasting at the base of rucks. And the creeping menace of players diving or demanding that opponents are shown cards must be emphatically, swiftly eradicated. Jonny Sexton has not played since suffering a head injury playing for Ireland against Australia in November . Fixture congestion is arguably the biggest threat to the sport, as it has such a wide-ranging impact. Player welfare is in danger as never before due to the excessive demands placed on those at the elite level, especially in Europe. Measures to improve concussion awareness and treatment are to be applauded, but the toll of serious injuries keeps rising. Bodies are breaking under the strain. Clubs and countries want their pound of flesh, but the regular absence of star players reduces the quality of the game. Too many Tests are being played to prop up unions’ finances and as well as causing injuries, it dilutes interest. Less can be more. This column continues to advocate a global season based on summer rugby in the northern hemisphere. One day, maybe... Twickenham will be among the 13 stadiums which will play host to the 2015 Rugby World Cup . The thorny issue of made-for-TV kick-off times may well come to a head during the World Cup, due to the alarming prospect of night matches at Twickenham and the Millennium Stadium. England’s opener against Fiji could bring transport chaos as it clashes with the weekly horror of the Friday evening rush-hour. In London, Cardiff and elsewhere, roads and trains will struggle with the task of ferrying fans home from venues. Next month, Wales host England on a Friday night, which means another motorway marathon for those crossing the Severn Bridge from the east. At club level, the new European Champions Cup features games on Sunday evenings. Broadcasters have their wall-to-wall coverage, but the wishes of spectators, especially those travelling from afar, are compromised. Sadly, the trend won’t be reversed until screens are filled with empty stands. England, celebrating the 2003 World Cup triumph, are the only Northern Hemisphere side to win the title . The scoreline stands at 6-1 to the South when it comes to World Cup titles. New Zealand, Australia and South Africa have each won the event twice, with only England in 2003 breaking this SANZAR grip on the Webb Ellis Cup. Here’s hoping for a Northern uprising in 2015. Ireland turned the tables on the raiders from the far side of the equator during the autumn, Stuart Lancaster’s England are capable of lowering the colours of any visitor at home and Wales may believe anything is possible now by beating the Springboks. France can conquer any team if the mood takes them, and even Scotland are equipped to dish out the odd bloody nose. The annual circus of hearing Kiwi players in particular reveal a total lack of awareness about the game in these parts is depressing and infuriating. Only beating them makes them take notice and show due respect. That would be a welcome development.","The home World Cup will launch at Twickenham in mid September .
New Zealand are favourites to win the tournament in England .
Finances, fixture congestion and officiating are still big issues ."
"Optimism has repeatedly proved unfounded in the past, so this year, this column is approaching the autumn Tests with a glass-half-empty outlook – when it comes to the hopes of the home nations. Over the next month, the full might of the southern-hemisphere elite will be showcased in London, Cardiff, Dublin and Edinburgh. On nine occasions, they will face British and Irish challenges to their global supremacy and all the indications are that they will once again fly back across the equator with more wins than losses. So many times in recent years, there has been a heartening sense of the perennial north v south gap narrowing, but it is hard to argue that case this time. The SANZAR countries continue to dominate their annual clashes with England, Wales, Ireland and Scotland. Australia, seen as the weakest of the big three, will be galvanized with Michael Cheika now in charge . The latest Rugby Championship once again delivered standards of intensity and skill which set the competing teams apart from their European rivals. South Africa’s epic victory over New Zealand was a vivid example of the apparently enduring gulf, while even stricken Australia so nearly raised themselves to sufficient heights to beat the world champions. As is so often the scenario, the Wallabies arrive on these shores as the perceived weakest link, but with Michael Cheika now in charge they are likely to be galvanised. The All Blacks and Springboks, meanwhile, have exerted a hold over the home nations and even end-of-season weariness may not be enough to break that cycle. Where will the northern wins occur? If the British and Irish finished with a win-count of five from their nine clashes with the big three touring teams, it would represent encouraging progress, but the omens are not good. England's injury problems, especially in the front five, will be a problem against a powerful South African side . England have the strongest pedigree when it comes to claiming southern scalps, but they start the autumn with a multitude of injuries, especially in the front five – which is bound to be especially telling against the powerful Boks. By then, given the absence of so many leading lights, they may have succumbed to a fourth straight loss to New Zealand in the space of six months. It is high time for an end to the damaging period of Welsh failure against the SANZAR countries, but that will appear as a distant fantasy if they suffer yet another near-miss against the Wallabies next Saturday. The Irish have key injuries and they no longer have Brian O’Driscoll, while a Scotland win over the All Blacks would represent one of the greatest upsets of this or any era. The head-over-heart prediction is for England, Ireland and Wales to muster a total of four wins between them. At home, that is not enough. Let’s hope the glass is fuller than it looks. England have the strongest pedigree when it comes to claiming southern scalps but have injury problems . Something had to give at Leicester and, sure enough, it has this week, with backs coach Paul Burke leaving the club following a grim 15-3 defeat at the Scarlets. The Tigers have endured a poor start to the season but Burke has been unfortunate to lose his job with the East Midlands side in the midst of a debilitating injury crisis. The Irishman has to operate with a continuously revolving and diminishing cast of fit backs – leading to endless reshuffles and a lack of cohesion. At least in the short term, Leicester will fill the void from within. Another Irishman, Geordan Murphy, will take on the role vacated by Burke, after assisting him since retiring as a player. If the man once dubbed the ‘George Best of rugby’ by Dean Richards can bring the same unorthodox flair to his coaching as he did to his own game as a free-spirit full-back, he will transform the Tigers’ attacking game. Yet, he faces a daunting equation – resources are diminished, but expectations are not. Paul Burke can consider himself unlucky to have lost his job as backs coach at Leicester . After Samu Manoa had made his 100th appearance for Northampton last weekend, he was congratulated by club-mate Tom Wood on Twitter, as he prepared to return home to America to take on the All Blacks. The flanker no doubt spoke for the entire England squad when he said: ‘Good luck next weekend, soften them up for us.’ The USA will go toe-to-toe with the world champions in front of a sell-out crowd of 62,000 at Soldier Field, Chicago, tomorrow, a week before New Zealand face Stuart Lancaster’s men at Twickenham. Realistically, the Eagles can’t hope to beat the Kiwis, but they can throw a spanner in the works by targeting Sonny Bill Williams on his return to union, or shackling Dan Carter when he emerges from the bench for his Test comeback. This fixture is a potentially momentous occasion in the history of USA rugby, so the hosts can benefit from it hugely in the long-term, but in the short-term they could also help Europe’s leading nations by further slowing the All Black juggernaut. Saints flanker Samu Manoa had made his 100th appearance for Northampton last weekend . Dan Lydiate is heading home to Wales after the November international window – a less-than-startling development which was confirmed by his Parisian club, Racing Metro. It is likely that he will re-surface in Swansea with the Ospreys, on a dual contract with the WRU. His return home makes sense, as the move across the Channel has been an ill-fated exercise. In his pomp, Lydiate is a Lion and a formidable Test player, but he has been under-valued by his French employers. Warren Gatland will welcome the blindside flanker back into the Welsh game with open arms, knowing that there is ample time to repair his confidence and restore his game to its peak before next year’s World Cup. Last Word – It was somehow inevitable. Having ignited the rebellion against the European status quo which led to the creation of the new Champions Cup, Aviva Premiership clubs have suffered in the early stages of the new tournament. After two rounds of matches, the tally of victories for each of the competing leagues is as follows; Premiership five, French Top 14 seven and Guinness Pro12 eight. The results will be particularly satisfying in Ireland – whose provinces have claimed four wins in six games – and Scotland, for whom Glasgow have blazed a trail with back-to-back successes. In fact, the latter have generated much of the intrigue so far. Their 37-10, opening-weekend demolition of Bath was arguably the most eye-catching result to date, while Munster’s last-kick win at Sale delivered the most remarkable drama of the new event’s initial encounters. Pool-stage ‘derbies’ may fit in with the heightened meritocracy this year but, as expected, they and the occasionally absurd kick-off times are not a positive development. Dan Lydiate is likely to head to the Ospreys after his time with Parisian club Racing Metro .","The home nations are likely to be dominated in the autumn Tests .

"Rhys Priestland appears to have decided that fighting for his Wales career isn't worth all the grief. Given the extent of it, who can really blame him? The Scarlets fly-half is off to Bath at the end of the season, having had to endure a torrent of abuse during recent times, in relation to his Test exploits. Sadly, the sort of vitriol aimed at the talented and decent 27-year-old reflects a creeping curse in the game. Rugby’s core values, as outlined by the world governing body, are under threat. More precisely, two of them; ‘respect’ and ‘solidarity’, are being endangered by a third; ‘passion’, in its most skewed forms. The bile hurled Priestland’s way is just one of many recent examples. Wales and Scarlets fly-half Rhys Priestland is off to Bath at the end of the season . At around the time the stand-off was under siege, England hooker Dylan Hartley suffered a deluge of abuse on Twitter, after he was harshly sin-binned against South Africa. He revealed several messages to shine a light on the issue and later insisted that bullying is still bullying, even if the target is a robust, front-row forward. Weeks earlier, officials at the RFU were forced to launch an investigation after Welsh referee Nigel Owens was subjected to homophic abuse at Twickenham. Two spectators were later banned from the venue. Meanwhile, the use of foul language aimed at officials or the visitors has become a feature of the big-match experience at Thomond Park in Limerick. Once again, the desire to convey passion has been given a toxic twist. Wales captain Sam Warburton was victim of abuse on social media last season . On Thursday, former England full back Delon Armitage appealed against a ban for abusing Leicester supporters, partly on the grounds that he was also the victim of unsavoury abuse at Welford Road. At Northampton, a steward is now stationed between visiting coaches and home fans, as a result of ugly exchanges. Elsewhere, screens have been erected to muffle expletive-laden rants. This is not a sudden, new phenomenon. Last season, Wales captain Sam Warburton was savaged on social media after signing a central contract, while Gloucester had to stage an inquest after crowd unrest at Kingsholm. But the trend is becoming more pronounced. Rugby must carefully guard its values and its soul, but all is not yet lost. A week ago at Northampton, as home No 10 Stephen Myler lined up a goal-kick, his half-back partner Lee Dickson shouted instructions to other team-mates and was subjected to tongue-in-cheek heckling from the stands for breaking the silence. That’s the spirit of the game in a nut-shell, and it must be preserved. Dean Richards was understandably cheerful after last Friday’s game at Franklin’s Gardens. Although his Newcastle Falcons side had lost to champions Northampton, they had fought the good fight, with bold intent. Their performance was a heartening throw-back to the days of the flying Falcons in the era of Jonny Wilkinson, Toby Flood, Dave Walder, Tom May, Jamie Noon and Mathew Tait; when the Tyneside team used local talent from the academy to compete with the best. Tom Catterick (centre) is one of the local lads flourishing at Newcastle Falcons . Now, the likes of Mark Wilson, Chris Harris, Tom Catterick and George McGuigan are performing with fearless conviction in exalted company week after week. Newcastle appear well coached and in that regard, Walder is said to be working wonders behind the scenes. Richards appears to repeating the sort of root-and-branch transformation that he oversaw at Harlequins, before being derailed by the ‘Bloodgate’ affair. It is good to see his latest salvage job taking shape and great to see the North East club - with such strategic importance in the bigger, national picture - on the rise. Vunipola must take fight to Morgan . England’s coaches will watch the Gloucester vs Saracens Aviva Premiership match at Kingsholm with keen interest, as their two leading No 8s, Ben Morgan and Billy Vunipola, engage in an intriguing personal duel. Morgan has claimed the upper hand in the Test team, but he will be wary of his opposite number’s capacity to wreak havoc, when the mood takes him. Billy Vunipola is set to engage in an intriguing personal duel with Ben Morgan at Kingsholm . The younger Vunipola brother has been a source of frustration for the national management, having arrived on the summer tour in despondent mood after back-to-back finals defeats with Saracens, then playing without great conviction. He subsequently started the autumn campaign as first-choice but lost his place amid a flurry of errors, and concerns about his inability to play for 80 minutes at international level. Vunipola should use Friday’s encounter to kick-start a revival ahead of the Six Nations. Fully fit and firing, he is a powerful asset. Unconvincing denial of the week. Bristol director of rugby, Andy Robinson, responding to Sportsmail’s revelation that Gavin Henson is destined to sign for the club, told the Bath Chronicle: ‘There’s always lots of speculation. Gavin is a talented player who has played well for Bath. We have a lot of respect for the way he goes out and plays the game but I’m not saying either “yes” or “no” as to whether we’re looking at him. One thing you could always say about Gavin Henson is he can play at 10, he can play at 12 and he can goal-kick. So for certain clubs, he is of interest, because he can do that. I will make comment regarding him joining Bristol if a contract is agreed.’ Expect that comment to be a matter of when, rather than if… . Wales utility back Gavin Henson set to leave Bath amid interest from Bristol . Last Word . The salary cap debate rages on with renewed ferocity. This week, Sale’s director of rugby, Steve Diamond, suggested that some Premiership clubs are operating £2-2.5million over the limit. There hasn’t been a stampede of people attempting to knock down his theory. His counterpart at Harlequins, Conor O’Shea, has mounted a stirring defence of the cap concept, in his column for ESPNscrum.com, saying: ‘We have a duty to ensure we have a game that is vibrant and sustainable, within the rules. If we do not stick to them… there would be arms race the richest would win. We would not be doing the game the service we owe it as custodians.’ This column fully endorses these sentiments. The cap must stay, but every effort must be made to raise the limit based on strong, long-term investment. France is the financial powerhouse nation at present, but money has flowed into the Gallic game since the 2007 World Cup there. With the tournament here this year, the elite clubs must be ready to harness a surge of interest. Then, in time, spending levels can rise to match those of their cross-Channel rivals.","Rhys Priestland has taken a gamble by agreeing Bath deal .

"Nearly a million tickets were sold last month for the World Cup and the phenomenal demand means England fans face disappointing news when ballot results are revealed on Friday. Despite high ticket prices, the hosts’ Pool A match against Australia at Twickenham drew 650,000 applications during the general sale period. Given that only around a quarter of the stadium’s 82,000 seats were available, approximately three per cent of applicants will be successful. Public appetite to watch England means the encounter with Wales is also massively over-subscribed, as is the tournament final next October 31, which attracted 500,000 applications. Other games which generated greatest demand are holders New Zealand against Argentina at Wembley on the opening weekend, Australia v Wales and both semi-finals. There has been phenomenal demand for the England v Australia World Cup pool clash at Twickenham . In total there were 650,000 ticket applications  for England's pivotal clash against the Wallabies . England's pool match against Wales has proved almost as popular with 500,000 applications . The majority  will be left disappointed but the volume of applications shows the passion for Rugby in the UK . In all, 950,000 tickets have been allocated through the general sale, on top of the 340,000 which were sold through rugby clubs earlier this year. Supporter tour packages are on course to break records and hospitality boxes have sold out at Twickenham, Exeter and Brighton. Debbie Jevans, chief executive of organisers England Rugby 2015, said: ‘We are thrilled with demand a year out from the tournament and the record level of demand we saw in September is a terrific indicator of the general interest and excitement for World Cup 2015. Demand has exceeded supply for a high number of matches and the only down-side is that there will inevitably be some disappointment. ‘Anyone who missed out on tickets this time will get first priority when the remaining tickets go back on sale next month.’ England Rugby 2015 chief executive Debbie Jevans is delighted with the incredible demand for tickets . Of course, the task now will be to drive sales for the less-coveted matches. There are understood to be plenty of tickets left for many games at the Millennium Stadium and for the fixtures in Leeds, Leicester, Birmingham and Newcastle. But the bandwagon is well and truly rolling and that will take the pressure off organisers in terms of their financial obligations. This World Cup will balance the books after the last tournament in New Zealand generated limited revenue. England won the hosting rights largely on the basis of their ability to generate substantial profit to meet the £80million guarantee payment to the IRB and end up with some change in the bank. That target is seemingly in hand. The strong sales represent a giant leap towards the overall goal of shifting 2.3million tickets through all channels worldwide. They demonstrate a heartening interest in the game in this country and provide another example of the British support for major sports events, as was the case at the 2012 Olympics and the Commonwealth Games this year. New Zealand lifted the trophy in 2011, and as the right-hand graphic shows there are millions who want to see the 2015 tournament . While those involved with marketing and sales drive must maintain the momentum, the next challenge is looming — one of a logistical variety. England face Samoa next month at Twickenham in a Test which kicks off at 7pm. It will be used as a practice run for the night games which will be taking place at HQ next year. Experience suggests there will be gridlock on the roads and long queues to catch the last trains back into the capital or out to the south and west. Yet there were fears that London would grind to a halt during the Olympics and they proved unfounded. Perhaps a few scare stories in the build-up and some strategic road closures on match-days might have the same liberating effect. Sam Burgess will belatedly arrive at Bath next week armed with yet another accolade. The 25-year-old was in Brisbane on Thursday to collect his award as the Rugby League International Federation’s world Player of the Year, the first Englishman to receive the prestigious prize. ‘It’s unexpected really,’ said the Yorkshireman, who is recovering from surgery after fracturing a cheekbone and eye socket during South Sydney Rabbitohs’ NRL Grand Final triumph. ‘I wasn’t supposed to be in the country. I was supposed to be out of here a couple of weeks ago.’ Instead, Burgess was on hand to present England shirts to four uncapped players ahead of their Four Nations clash with Samoa on Saturday. One of the newcomers, Hull’s Joe Westerman, said: ‘He’s always been an awesome player. It was a bit emotional for him. He wishes he was out there playing with us.’ Bath and — eventually — England will hope he soon proves as inspirational in union. Sam Burgess poses after being awarded rugby league's International Player of the Year award on Thursday . Australia have provided a soap opera this year and there is every chance the drama will go on now Michael Cheika has been put in charge. He has a strong record with Leinster and the New South Wales Waratahs, but he is also highly volatile. In March, he was given a suspended six-month ban by Super Rugby’s governing body for abusing a cameraman in South Africa. The judicial officer noted: ‘The propensity of Mr Cheika to behave in this manner is disturbing.’ He also broke a glass door at Canberra Stadium this year, was warned about his conduct by SANZAR last year and was fined after his Stade Francais side lost the 2011 Amlin Challenge Cup Final. On that occasion, he told Harlequins coach Tony Diprose: ‘Get out of the ****ing way, you ****ing moron.’ Cheika will have to behave at least until the end of next August, or his suspended ban would kick in just in time for the World Cup. New South Wales Waratahs boss Michael Cheika has replaced Ewen McKenzie as Australia's head coach . Quote of the week — ‘He’s a mercenary, there’s no question about that, but he’s a terribly gifted sportsman. While we might not all agree with the New Zealand Rugby Union letting him come and go as he pleases, I guess that’s the reality of professional sport.’ Former All Blacks coach Laurie Mains on Sonny Bill Williams’ Test recall, just weeks after returning from another stint in league. Former All Blacks coach Laurie Mains has had his say on Sonny Bill Williams’ (centre) Test recall . Last Word —  Wasps wing Christian Wade scored a sensational solo try against Leinster last week with a burst of pace and fancy footwork that even brought Irish fans to their feet in raucous tribute. It was the sort of ‘X-factor’ moment England want to see performed on their behalf, but his lack of bulk continues to count against him. After naming an elite squad without Wade in it, Stuart Lancaster said: ‘We talk about Sonny Bill coming back into New Zealand’s back line, alongside Savea and Fekitoa. It’s not to say you can’t have Wade. 'You can, but have to have the balance right.’ In other words, his chance will come only if England deploy sufficiently imposing figures throughout the rest of their back line. Size matters more than ever. Nimble artistry is being blasted out of the Test equation. It is a real shame. Christian Wade's omission from the England squad shows that artistry is being ignored in test rugby .","There has been phenomenal demand for tickets for next year's World Cup and the ballot results will be revealed on Friday .

"When the USA play their historic match against the All Blacks in Chicago on November 1, they are destined to be at full strength, with all their English-based players available. But there will be a price. It was reported in the States this week that USA Rugby have an agreement with Aviva Premiership clubs which will see their American players released en masse for the clash with the world champions at Soldier Field. Even though the fixture falls outside the official Test ‘window’, the likes of Northampton No 8 Samu Manoa, Leicester wing Blaine Scully and Saracens’ utility back Chris Wyles are all due to be available. It was claimed that a deal has been struck by the chief executive of USA Rugby, ex-England captain Nigel Melville, to secure the services of these players and several others for the high-profile visit of New Zealand, in return for them being sent back to their clubs for the rest of November. That would mean they are not able to take part in subsequent matches against Romania, Tonga and Fiji. Chris Wyles of Saracens and the USA runs in for a try against Gloucester on Saturday . Blaine Scully of Leicester and the USA scores under the floodlights for Tigers against Harlequins on Friday . Samu Manoa of Northampton and the USA scored a hat-trick against Sale on Saturday afternoon . Sportsmail has been told that a firm agreement is not yet in place, but that talks are on-going. It is understood that the IRB will not seek to take any action in defence of their Regulation Nine, governing player release, due to the unique circumstances surrounding the USA-All Blacks fixture. On the one hand, this is understandable, to a degree. The world governing body recognise the symbolic importance of a New Zealand visit to America, as it may have a galvanising effect on a potentially vast and largely untapped market. For Melville and USA Rugby, it is reasonable to throw all the autumn eggs into one basket this time, knowing they must put their best foot forward when they have the attention of the nation. They can also use the remaining games as opportunities for experimentation. And the Premiership clubs want some payback if they are to release players when they don’t have to. New Zealand will face the USA in a showcase fixture in Chicago in November . Nigel Melville, the former England scrum-half, is now the chief executive of USA Rugby . But long-term, this can’t carry on. Regulation Nine is the hottest potato in the game. Clubs and countries are vying for the same players in a congested calendar. The result is bartering and horse-trading, temporary solutions and a patching-up of disputes. There needs to be more permanent clarity. Fixtures must be reduced and ring-fenced. Test teams should expect access at the right times, but not keep expanding their schedules. Australia are playing five matches in Europe next month, at the end of a shattering season. It is money-driven madness. Play less, pay less, stop haggling, prioritise the welfare of players and their right to represent their country – and don’t undermine the sport with over-kill. As the Steffon Armitage saga rumbles on, it is understood that Dan Lydiate may soon be on his way back from Racing Metro to Wales, while there has also been speculation about Jamie Roberts’ future in Paris. Neither man has made a substantial impact across the Channel, partly due to injuries and irregular selection. Lydiate has been strongly linked with the Ospreys and that prospect should appeal to the Lions flanker. The Swansea-based region are enjoying a wonderful resurgence – as the only unbeaten team in Europe’s three main leagues – without the cast-list of Galacticos that they had in previous years. Dan Baker is making waves at No 8, as is Eli Walker on the wing, allied to the astute control of Wales half-backs Rhys Webb and Dan Biggar. The Ospreys have the look of a side who are well coached, which is a tribute to Steve Tandy and his staff. It is also fitting encouragement for Alun Wyn Jones, the captain who turned down a pile of Euros, stayed loyal and is now leading a hungry, upwardly-mobile squad. Lydiate could do worse than jump aboard the bandwagon. Welsh flanker Dan Lydiate has been linked with a move away from French club Racing Metro . England scrum half Danny Care is back from a fleeting paternity break to join the start of Harlequins’ assault on the new European Champions Cup, at home to Castres on Friday night. The visitors come to The Stoop without the array of international Test firepower at the disposal of some leading French sides, but they do have two exiled Scots, in the towering shape of Lions lock Richie Gray and the centre Max Evans. They also have a dangerous flanker, Ibrahim Diarra, who almost single-handedly ran Northampton ragged at Franklin’s Gardens four years ago, before celebrating his Man of the Match award with a post-match, pitch-side cigarette. It was an indication of the enduring cultural differences within European rugby, but if he tries to smoke at the ground tonight, the stewards won’t stand for it, even if he has just lit up the game… . Proud father Danny Care posted a picture alongside his newborn son on Instagram . They should have given him a mask and cape for the occasion. Australia are in meltdown, with backs to the wall, so they’ve sent for Quade Cooper to save their skins. The maverick playmaker is back from injury and on the bench for Saturday’s dead-rubber Bledisloe Cup game against New Zealand and embattled coach Ewen McKenzie must hope that the fly-half can deliver an inspirational cameo in his home city of Brisbane. ‘It’s an attitude thing,’ said Cooper – whose own attitude has been repeatedly questioned in the past. ‘The attitude is something we can really pick up.’ He’s right about that one. The Wallabies are in utter disarray, so even showing some unity and honour in near-certain defeat would be an improvement. Quade Cooper has returned to the Australia squad for this weekend's Test against New Zealand . Last Word – When Clermont Auvergne beat Saracens in the 2012 Heineken Cup quarter-final in Watford, they brought 2,000 supporters to Vicarage Road and the raucous ‘yellow army’ illuminated a drab venue. On Saturday, there are likely to be around 50 fans from the French club at Allianz Park for the same fixture. They have evidently opted to save their travel budget for another occasion, but in many cases, rugby is not doing very well when it comes to enticing visiting spectators. Kick-off times are becoming more absurd with every passing season – geared towards on-screen viewing figures, not in-ground attendances. This Sunday, Wasps face Leinster at 5.15pm, while the December fixtures announced last Friday have Leicester hosting champions Toulon at Welford Road at 5.30pm on a Sunday. These are not fan-friendly times. The same can be said for Friday-night internationals in particular, not least when they involve crossing the Severn Bridge in rush hour. One theory is that some clubs don’t tend to bring many supporters with them, so there is no need to cater for their needs – well, they never will if their needs continue to be shamefully ignored.

"Stick or twist? That was the dilemma for Wasps. Move or die? They have taken the right decision, but they are going in the wrong direction. Sentiment and tradition are all very well, but in the professional era they sometimes have to give way to cold, hard reality. Wasps’ tenancy in High Wycombe wasn’t working. Crowds of 5-6,000 simply won’t suffice. No wonder the club have been losing £3million a year. The announcement of their relocation to Coventry has been accompanied by an outcry on behalf of the supporters, but a lack of them is one of the primary problems. Of course, the loyal followers who turn up at game after game are entitled to vent their angst, but the bottom line is that the club had to gamble on developing a larger fan-base elsewhere. It is brutal. It is business. That’s modern sport – for better or worse. Wasps' James Haskell, Dai Young and Andy Goode during the announcement of a new stadium and sponsor . Dai Young (right) speaks to press during the announcement of Land Rover as the new club sponsors . Wasps’ training ground in Acton is sub-standard, as is the venue they have played in for so long. Shifting to the Ricoh Arena and – eventually – a new, purpose-built training ground in Coventry makes sense in terms of facilities and growth potential, but not in terms of geography. Why the West Midlands? This column’s misgivings are not sentimental ones. Wasps may have been a ‘London’ club for the bulk of their long history, but in the professional era they have drifted, from Sudbury to Shepherd’s Bush and on to Buckinghamshire – 30 miles from the capital. Alternative options in their familiar territory were considered and discarded. They have decided to take the caravan to a large city with a strong rugby heritage, which is wise, but it is in a congested area of elite clubs. Worcester are angry at what they regard as rivals parking a tank on their lawn, with some justification. Leicester are even nearer – just 24 miles away and Northampton are also in close proximity. A major sponsorship deal partly explains the choice of location, but they had a prime chance to expand the map of the sport in this country, which is too narrow. Large swathes of the south and east represent an untapped market. Three regular starters in the England team; Joe Marler, Joe Launchbury and Billy Twelvetrees, come from Sussex and the impressive Brighton Community Stadium is hosting World Cup matches next year. Why not harness that galvanising factor and head for the coast? There are potentially suitable stadia in Hampshire and Kent too, or Suffolk and Norfolk – where the Youngs brothers hail from. Coventry City Football Club have only recently returned to the Ricoh Arena after a year away . Wasps are moving away from Adams Park, located in High Wycombe, to further their ambitions as a club . Places exist where an ambitious club could establish strong roots, without straying on to patches which are already occupied. But now that Wasps have made their decision, more pertinent even than the grievance of fans will be the views of the players. If their leading men are prepared to embrace the relocation and strong links are forged with Coventry Rugby Club and Coventry City FC, the move may not be doomed to failure as many suggest. But if life away from London doesn’t appeal to the likes of Joe Launchbury, James Haskell and Christian Wade – leading to a break-up of the current squad – the venture is destined to fail. Good news for Leicester and England – Manu Tuilagi is back. The wrecking-ball centre has recovered from a persistent groin problem to start for the Tigers in Friday night's Aviva Premiership clash against Harlequins at Welford Road. How the East Midlands club need him. With Tuilagi in midfield, they won their first two games of the season. In his absence, they have lost three on the bounce. If Leicester are beaten on Friday night, it would be the first time in a decade they have lost four in a row, but Tuilagi’s timely return means Vereniki Goneva reverts to the wing and Mathew Tait is fit to resume at full back. Argentina prop Marcos Ayerza has completed the long-haul trek from Mendoza to a place on the Tigers’ bench, six days after being at the vanguard of his country’s historic victory over Australia. Tom Croft is missing again – which suggests that his knee injury is worse than first thought. Meanwhile, Quins have recalled Will Collier at tighthead prop in an otherwise unchanged side. Manu Tuilagi will be hoping to steady the Leicester ship as he makes his return from injury on Friday night . The backlash has begun. Just four days after Sam Burgess’s selfless heroics for South Sydney Rabbitohs in the NRL Grand Final, rugby league authorities in Australia have asked the club to explain why the Yorkshireman was allowed to play the whole game with a broken cheekbone and eye socket. At a time when concussion is a hot topic, acclaim for Burgess’s brave contribution to an epic triumph has been superseded by accusations that he shouldn’t have been allowed to keep taking so many punishing hits when he had already incurred significant damage. The 25-year-old has had four metal plates inserted into his face and his cross-code move to Bath has been delayed by a month, at least, as he recovers from surgery. His staggering commitment last Sunday served to whet union’s appetite – beyond the confines of the West Country – for their next convert. Burgess is a prodigious talent and a true warrior, but Bath and England must be prepared to occasionally save him from himself. Sam Burgess (left)  played on with a broken cheekbone and eye socket for South Sydney in the NRL Grand Final . Rugby’s gravy train continues to rumble on in France. The All Blacks’ playmaker, Dan Carter, is angling for a return to the Gallic game – after a previous, injury-wrecked stint at Perpignan – and the asking price is thought to be EU1million per year. That was the figure that Racing Metro reportedly offered in a vain attempt to lure Matt Giteau from Toulon, so the Parisian club’s owner, Jacky Lorenzetti, won’t want to miss out on another iconic southern hemisphere player to replace the departing Jonathan Sexton. Initial indications are that Toulon won’t enter this particular auction, so Racing may have a clear run, as even most rich French clubs will baulk at an unprecedented seven-figure salary. Carter’s fitness and playing powers may be in gradual decline, but he remains a stellar talent with commercial clout – the world’s ultimate bums-on-seats signing. Dan Carter is being linked with a big money move to Europe after next year's Rugby World Cup . Last Word – The state of turmoil in Australian rugby is reaching critical levels. Last weekend, the Wallabies became Argentina’s first victims in the Rugby Championship, as their scrum and discipline disintegrated. Amid fears about a post-World Cup player exodus, the outlook for Kurtley Beale looks increasingly bleak as he faces an investigation over allegations of sending ‘inappropriate and deeply offensive’ texts about a member of ARU staff. Meanwhile, Robbie Deans has released a book savaging the players who capitulated to the Lions last year, in his final match as national coach, and Giteau has shown Australia what they are missing by earning the award for Player of the Year in France’s Top 14 league. All this comes against a backdrop of panic that the ARU could be insolvent next year, as revenues have slumped. Trouble and strife Down Under won’t elicit much sympathy in these parts, but it is not good for the game at large. The Wallabies are stumbling towards next year’s World Cup, but Pool A opponents England and Wales should be wary of seeing them as easy prey.

"Owen Farrell is 23. It is worth emphasising that point, because he is often wrongly perceived as a seasoned veteran and that is not helping him. Four years ago, he was on loan at Bedford, in the Championship. Now, he has played 28 Tests for England, represented the Lions and – as befitting an accelerated career path – finds his international credentials being cast into doubt. Amid the rush to lambast the Saracens fly-half for his poor form on England duty last month, it is appropriate to consider the context. Firstly, he was a victim of circumstances beyond his control. Secondly, he will feature prominently at next year’s World Cup, providing he is not injured. Owen Farrell (left) poses with his team mates after England's 26-17 win over Australia in November . Farrell (right) has been criticised for his underwhelming form in England's Autumn international fixtures . Without doubt, Farrell was off-colour at Twickenham, during the defeats against New Zealand and South Africa. Without doubt, he deserved to be dropped to the bench – if not further – for the series-ending victory over Australia, following a hit-and-miss shift at inside centre against Samoa. But to write him off would be ludicrous. As a dogged competitor, he will relish vying with his good friend, George Ford, for the England No 10 shirt that he has lost, for now. Mark McCall, Saracens’ director of rugby, has defended his man, by claiming that Farrell was ‘rusty’ going into the November campaign. That is a colossal under-statement. After a month out injured, he had played one full and unconvincing match before earning an immediate England recall. Mark McCall, Saracens' director of rugby, has said Farrell was 'rusty' ahead of England's November fixtures . The bottom line is that he should not have been picked to face the All Blacks. He wasn’t ready. As McCall said: ‘He played one 80 minutes and was asked to face New Zealand, which is a pretty tough ask.’ Another under-statement. In fact, it was an impossible task. Stuart Lancaster and his assistants needed an alternative plan, but they didn’t feel they had a viable one to fall back on. Ford had missed the summer tour of New Zealand, so he hadn’t been exposed to the furnace-heat of a Test match in the balance. Freddie Burns and Danny Cipriani had deputised well, but neither had been included in the senior squad in late October. The extenuating circumstances went further back. First, Charlie Hodgson retired from Tests and then Toby Flood decided that a move to Toulouse was more appealing than playing second fiddle to the rookie. So the safety net had been removed. In lieu of genuine experience, Farrell assumed the mantle of the veteran in his position, despite his relative youth. Time and time again, Lancaster was forced to consider the doomsday threat of being forced to find a replacement, and that unwelcome scenario came to pass last month. Ford seized his opportunity with aplomb. He played flat to the line and showed his ability to unlock defences with astute distribution, tactical kicking, pace and footwork. Farrell does not have all those attributes in his repertoire, but neither did Jonny Wilkinson and it didn’t stop him becoming the country’s iconic, World Cup-winning hero. Stuart Lancaster decided to drop Farrell in place of Billy Twelvetrees for the international against Australia . Like Wilkinson, Farrell is a ‘Test match animal’. In a position often populated by more delicate artists, he is made of steel, with a warrior spirit and armed with cold composure as a supreme goal-kicker, despite the competitive fire that rages within. What he needs now is game after game after game at fly-half for Saracens, to rediscover his missing sharpness, while further honing his efforts to feel at home playing flat to the line. It may actually help him that Ford has earned Lancaster’s trust, as it reduces the risk that he will be assessed differently to others. To start a Test, he must be ready; fully fit and playing well. At the age of 23, he is no veteran. He cannot slot back into the old routine without preparation. Farrell will be an international match-winner again, of that there can be no doubt, but England have learned the hard way that he needs to be handled with care, like all their other assets. Irish rugby is on a roll. Amid the after-glow of a triumphant autumn campaign for Joe Schmidt’s national team, the country’s union – with government backing – will today outline plans to host the 2023 World Cup. On the field, Ireland will surely go into the Six Nations as favourites to defend their title after beating South Africa, convincingly, and Australia last month. Their prospects at next year’s World Cup appear increasingly bright. Yet, the audacious 2023 hosting plan may be doomed, despite being a united north-south bid, and even allowing for potential use of Gaelic sports venues, including the towering Croke Park in Dublin. The USA may enter the fray and global rugby authorities will be desperate to open up that huge market, while South Africa, Italy and Argentina are all thought to be interested. Jonathan Sexton (centre) in action for Ireland in their 26-23 win against Australia last month . The 2011 tournament in New Zealand generated modest revenue and England are having to make up the short-fall with the lucrative 2015 extravaganza. Twickenham is drowning in logos and general commercial over-load in the increasing effort to maximise profits. To avoid such a scenario again, the chance of smaller nations being awarded the hosting rights have surely faded to nothing. In the modern era of meticulous professionalism, there is still room for the primal, powerful concept of motivation by irritation. Sale have been irked by Saracens’ attitude ahead of tomorrow’s European Champions Cup clash in Salford. Steve Diamond, their fiery director of rugby, said: ‘We’ve been written off. Saracens have already openly stated on TV after their defeat at Munster that they will pick the bonus points up against Sale. Steve Diamond is upset with the attitude shown by Saracens ahead of their clash with Sale . It was one of the players who showed it to me and it is being used as a little tool.’ One Sale player suggested that Saracens are known for being ‘arrogant’ and that the hosts will be fired-up to make a mockery of their rivals’ perceived superiority complex. It is shaping up to be a feisty, niggly, abrasive encounter. Quote of the week . Leicester’s director of rugby, Richard Cockerill, was on vintage comedy form as he reflected on Tom Croft’s delayed return to action after injury, saying: ‘Crofty was in the 23 last weekend, but his wife decided to have a baby. Leicester's director of rugby Richard Cockerill was in hilarious form talking about Tom Croft becoming a dad . 'He’s a proud dad of Victoria. It took long enough – started Friday and finished Saturday afternoon! 'For some reason they wanted to have the baby at the General hospital rather than the Royal Infirmary (close to Welford Road), so he couldn’t even pop across the road to play, then pop back again. 'That’s the reason they built the hospital there!’ Last Word . England and Wales players will hurl themselves into European club combat this weekend, their bodies still shattered from four Tests in succession last month. It is too much of a strain. The clubs cannot be blamed for picking their leading men for key continental fixtures which could make or break their season – especially as they have been without those players since late October. Twelvetrees (second right) and his England team-mates should have an extra break after their exertions . By and large, the club directors of rugby and coaches demonstrate a commendable desire to manage the work-load of their internationals. The stark fact is that four Tests in November is excessive and is driven by financial considerations. It requires the IRB, or World Rugby – as they now wish to be known – to strictly regulate the congested calendar. Each European nation should play two Tests against leading southern-hemisphere countries and one against a Tier Two side every autumn, before an obligatory rest week for all players involved. Less games = less injuries = a better product. Rocket science, it most certainly isn’t… .","Owen Farrell would benefit from people realising how far he has come .

"Take a bow England. That was an outstanding win and a perfect way to start a huge year. To make light of their injuries, to come to Wales on a Friday night and stay so cool and composed when they went 10-0 down was exceptional. It was one of the very best performances of the Stuart Lancaster era. I really enjoyed the contribution of the young Bath trio behind the scrum with Anthony Watson, Jonathan Joseph and George Ford all stepping up. This was a big night for them and they all delivered.

It was a huge second-half performance generally by England as they took the game by the scruff of the neck and bossed it in exactly the way you would hope from a team with genuine World Cup hopes. The physicality was excellent but very controlled and disciplined and James Haskell overcame a nervous start – his missed tackle contributed to Wales’ first try – to produce probably his best England display. He was aggressive and relentless and took the battle to Wales in the way he does every week for Wasps. All the England pack went well – I expected nothing less despite injuries in the second row – and although I was worried for a few minutes when Lancaster started emptying the bench when England were picking up momentum, everybody came through. Billy Twlevetrees was tackling like a man possessed at the end there. Behind the scrum again just about everybody put their hand up with the Bath trio looking hungry and happy to take centre stage. There was an excitement and vitality to the England performance, not to mention a couple of very classy moments which really excited me going forward because this was a high-pressure match. I can’t remember a bigger start to the Six Nations tournament and it was a real taster for the World Cup where every match will feel this big and important. The atmosphere was fantastic, inspiring, but we always knew it would be – roof open or not. Wales got off to a bright start  when scrum-half Rhys Webb (left) ran in to score the game's first try . The in-form 26-year-old (centre) celebrates his try with Wales captain Sam Warburton (right) on Friday night . How the Six Nations table looks after Friday's result . Friday night was all about doing the right thing at the right time and doing it exceptionally well. And for the most part, it was a red-letter day for England . Test rugby is about world-class play under intense pressure, getting it right when it counts most. We saw that with the first-half tries – Rhys Webb for Wales and Watson for England. It was my old favourite TCUP – Thinking Clearly Under Pressure. For the Wales try, England had seemingly rescued the situation with a powerful scrum on the Welsh put-in that sent the Wales pack travelling back at a rate of knots but Toby Faletau had the presence of mind to reach in and rescue the ball. In fact you could even argue that was handling in the scrum, he almost plucked it in the front row as the scrum disintegrated. But Faletau showed great athleticism and skill. He attacked from a standing start, exploded out of the blocks, handed off the defence and released Webb perfectly. Haskell, making his one mistake of the night, hesitated just for a second, went too high and got shrugged off. That’s all it takes at this level. And then again with England’s first try. England’s scrum had won a penalty and set up the field positon when Chris Robshaw’s pass went awry which often unsettles a defence. Mike Brown reacted superbly and put the ball on to his natural left foot to thread the grubber through. It was just about the only good option available and he took it. Watson read the play very well and showed real try-scoring instincts in getting the touchdown under pressure. That was world class at a time when England had to score next. Wales fullback Leigh Halfpenny punished England's ill-discipline by kicking some first half penalties . England fly-half George Ford controlled proceedings well as the visitors' dominated the second half . Watson was right at home – taking high ball, coming off his wing, working well with Brown. He was unlucky in the first half when he timed his ‘take’ perfectly so as not to take the ball into his 22 yet when Brown cleared 60 yards downfield he was brought back. Wrong call. That decision-making ability under pressure is key in defence and it was making the wrong decisions that cost England those two early penalties which is something they can and must work on. Wide out in the tramlines near the halfway line there was no reason for Jonny May to prevent release while Dan Cole was caught handling in a ruck needlessly 45 metres out. You just don’t do that when the opposition have a Leigh Halfpenny in their team. There was no danger in either situation for penalty but the mistakes resulted in England coughing up six points. Come the second half, we saw ice in the veins when Joseph took his try so well. There was just a half-chance there and although the Wales defence wasn’t the best the Bath centre did very well with his step and swivel. And at the death Ford absolutely buried that long penalty – it could have been Jonny Wilkinson slotting the ball over. Taking about pressure, that was definitely what caused the stand-off in the tunnel before the game. These unscripted things happen in sport. They are not choreographed; they just come from the dynamic tensions of the moment. It happened with us in Ireland in 2005 when Martin Johnson stood his ground and declined to move across to the other side of the halfway line for the anthems. It’s all part of the game, it’s all good fun but Chris Robshaw wasn’t going to move until he got an assurance that Wales would be following soon behind and I quite like that. England centre Jonathan Joseph scored the decisive try of the game with a fantastic second half effort .

"While Steffon Armitage continues to explore the possibility of representing France his brother, Delon, has claimed their exile across the Channel partly stems from England adopting a top-heavy selection policy. ‘The reason I left London Irish was the coaches from England pretty much saying, “If you’re not in the top four teams, you’re not going to play for England again”,’ said the Toulon full back. ‘I could have stayed at Irish and finished sixth or seventh and not played for England.’ He has a point. The latest England line-up, against New Zealand in Hamilton in June, featured 14 players from clubs in the top five of the Aviva Premiership last season: Saracens, Northampton, Leicester, Harlequins and Bath. Wasps lock Joe Launchbury was the only intruder, with his club finishing seventh. Delon Armitage runs with the ball druing Toulon's French Top 14 match against Brive . In all, nine of the league’s 12 clubs were represented in that England match-day 23, so it was in fact a reasonable spread of players from throughout the division. Northampton’s five-man contingent was the largest, reflecting their title-winning season. The bottom line is that Stuart Lancaster, along with coaches of other leading nations, sets a lot of store on primary European matches and major league head-to-heads, which provide the nearest simulation of international rugby. On that basis, Delon Armitage is right that national selection will inevitably reflect the balance of power at any given time. Perhaps it would be good for the bigger-picture if the team was founded on a wider base, but that is unrealistic. The cream will rise, unless a root-and-branch overhaul produces an unthinkable draft system. Instead, the likes of London Irish must continue to strive to lower the colours of richer rivals, as they so nearly did to Saracens last weekend — and rail against any sense of serving merely as feeder clubs for others with larger budgets. Toulon's Steffon Armitage is English and wants to play for England, but is in a preliminary squad for France . Quote of the week . Even in the aftermath of his Leicester team’s 45-0 drubbing in Bath, Richard Cockerill was in fine form with the media. Responding to questions about the club’s training regime in light of their injury crisis, he said: ‘Maybe we’ll just go to Costa and go go-karting! If I took them go-karting, some b****** would get run over! We train twice on Tuesday and Thursday. It didn’t harm us (Leicester teams he played in) — we were quite good then!’ Richard Cockerill, the Leicester Tigers director of rugby, whose team were defeated 45-0, walks off the field . While the Rugby Championship rages on in Cape Town and La Plata on Saturday, the most important match in a World Cup context will take place in a frozen, remote Siberian city. Krasnoyarsk hosts the first leg of a qualification match between Russia and Uruguay, which will decide who snatches the last tournament place in England’s pool. It promises to be an intriguing duel, as the visitors lie 19th in the IRB rankings, one place above their hosts, while four of the past five meetings between the nations since 2008 have been won by seven points or fewer. Officially, the world game’s leading administrators will remain neutral, but no doubt they would be glad to see ‘The Bears’ reach next year’s event on these shores — in the hope that a potentially huge market will increasingly embrace the sport. Sir John Kirwan will take charge of the Barbarians for autumn matches against Australia and Leicester, with the task of ensuring the invitational side remain relevant. After a high-calibre squad were dismantled 59-8 by the Lions in Hong Kong in June last year, the concept and future of the side was again in doubt. However, a side coached by Dean Ryan went some way to redressing the balance by beating an England XV 39-29 in June and now it falls to Kirwan to oversee a competitive game against the Wallabies at Twickenham on November 1, to justify ticket sales which have already passed 50,000.

"After being fourth official at Stamford Bridge on Saturday afternoon, Kevin Friend completed his lively weekend with another game of declined penalty appeals at St Mary's. The first came in the opening minute as Filip Djuricic went down very easily under close attention from Liverpool's Emre Can. However many replays are viewed it is not conclusive so I support Friend on this occasion. Liverpool centre back Dejan Lovren is booked by referee Kevin Friend during his return to St Mary's . Filip Djuricic should have been awarded a penalty when he was brought down by Liverpool's Joe Allen . But I felt that the same Saints forward should have had a penalty when he was brought down by Joe Allen with the home side trailing 1-0. Liverpool should have had a penalty of their own just after the half-hour mark when Jose Fonte clearly slid through Raheem Sterling after clipping the ball. There were another two or three good penalty appeals, though none of them were clear. Liverpool should have had a penalty of their own when Jose Fonte (left) clearly slid through Raheem Sterling . As for the Simon Mignolet handball, all the pundits seemed to agree it was accidental and so do I. If you look back, Friend missed one penalty for each team and as they balance out, they do not really become an issue. Friend will not be censured or criticised by PGMOL (Professional Game Match Officials Limited). In the context of the season he actually wasn't too bad. Friend missed legitimate penalty calls for both sides but, in the contest of the season , he wasn't too bad . Tottenham Hotspur vs West Ham . This was a very interesting game technically at White Hart Lane for Jon Moss and his assistants. The second West Ham goal should, in my opinion, have been disallowed for offside but I could see why it wasn't. Mark Noble crossed the ball to the far post where Cheikhou Kouyate jumped for it in front of Danny Rose. Kouyate couldn't reach it and the ball fell to Diafra Sakho who scored from a tight angle. Whilst Kouyate did not touch the ball, he was in an offside position when the ball was crossed and he certainly affected his opponent Rose and so should have been penalised. Diafra Sakho celebrates his goal at White Hart Lane, but it should have been disallowed for an offside . The late equaliser for Tottenham came when Alex Song needlessly fouled Harry Kane and his reaction to Moss's decision told you it was accurate. Given the time that elapsed, Moss probably allowed a little more time for the penalty to be taken which law stipulates and he should be pleased with his performance which contributed to an entertaining game. The late equaliser for Tottenham came when Alex Song needlessly fouled Harry Kane in the penalty area .","Kevin Friend was right not to award Filip Djuricic a penalty in the opening minute following a challenge from Emre Can .

"Edward Griffiths is right – the system of ending the Aviva Premiership with play-offs to decide the title is all about money. The motive is surely beyond doubt. Saracens’ chief executive rattled cages at the start of the domestic season last weekend by arguing that a league should be settled in the traditional manner, with the club who finish on top of the table becoming champions. But it was his honesty in declaring that the status quo is ‘only there for money reasons’ that really resonated. There is no imminent prospect of the landscape being altered, but that doesn’t diminish the validity of Griffiths’ remarks. Financial necessity drives the annual ritual of a 22-game campaign hinging on what follows; two semi-finals and a winner-takes-all final at Twickenham. Northampton Saints team captain Dylan Hartley (right) lifts the trophy after beating Saracens last season . Steve Borthwick of Saracens applauds the fans after defeat during last season's Aviva Premiership Final . A league is decided in cup format, which means it’s not really a league. That is not to knock the spectacle, which is often breath-taking, but after all these years it still doesn’t seem quite right. No wonder, really, as 12 titles have been settled via the play-offs, but only four clubs in that time have claimed the trophy after claiming first place – Sale, Leicester (twice) and Harlequins. There is never any real fanfare of support for the play-off system among participants. By and large, when asked about it, coaches and players unite in the view that it is now established and the same rules apply to everyone, so there can’t be any complaints. It is accepted, but not cherished. Yet, it is the standard model in professional rugby; used to decide France’s Top 14, the Pro12, Super 15 and the Championship tussle for promotion to the Premiership – where it is such a distorting factor that much of the regular season becomes incidental. Billy Twelvetrees of England scores against the Barbarians at Twickenham last year . The global calendar is too crowded, so removing play-offs would be wise in the bigger picture too. Perhaps a successful World Cup in these parts next year will generate such a surge in interest that a simple league format will suffice in generating precious profit. If there is a common desire to end the English season in style each year, how about this? Instead of play-offs, followed by England facing the Barbarians, perhaps the Premiership champions can go to Twickenham the following week to take on the national team (minus that club’s contingent) in a non-cap game. Now that would be a club v country confrontation worth watching. When World Cup tickets go on public sale on Friday, there will be a stampede to watch the big games involving hosts England, Wales and other leading nations, especially New Zealand. But much of the tournament’s charm will be found in lower-key pool fixtures, when neutrals choose sides to support or attend in the hope of an upset. In Brighton, Northampton’s American No 8 of Tongan descent, Samu Manoa, will be unleashed in brutal combat with the Pacific-island anagram of his name (Manu) Samoa. The earth will shake. Shock-seekers may fancy an afternoon at Kingsholm when Scotland face Japan, who are rising under the guidance of Eddie Jones and beat Wales last year. Gloucester’s ground also hosts Argentina v Georgia – heaven for scrum purists and a chance to observe the East European’s giant Mamuka ‘Godzilla’ Gorgodze at close quarters. Sandy Park, Exeter will reverberate as Tongan warriors attempt to find a way past Namibia’s immovable object – Jacques Burger of Saracens. Games like these will not be overly corporate occasions so take advantage of fair prices, adopt a minnow, paint faces and embrace the colour and diversity of the event. Namibia captain Jacques Burger in action against South Africa at the 2011 Rugby World Cup . The home nations are running for the hills – literally – when the World Cup countdown begins in earnest next summer. England go to Denver, Colorado for a fortnight and Wales are off to find height and heat; in Switzerland and Qatar. Never mind the fitness benefits of training at altitude, these are wise moves by Messrs Lancaster and Gatland for less scientific reasons. Cabin fever is a major threat. While the tournament doesn’t start until mid-September, squads will be together for the best part of 10 weeks prior to that point and no matter how luxurious the location, monotony becomes a big factor. Test rugby is such a detailed, labour-intensive business now, but the pursuit of excellence can go too far. On the basis that a change is as good as a break, different scenery will help to maintain focus. Down-time and the odd sociable outing are vital too, while briefly escaping the glare of pre-tournament hype is a sensible step. Minds as well as bodies must be fit for purpose. The Infinity Park in Denver, Colorado, will host England's rugby squad next summer ahead of the World Cup . There is much consternation in New Zealand rugby circles about the imminent loss of a teenage prodigy known as ‘Tongan Thor’. Taniela Tupou is a 21-stone prop who grew up in Tonga but is said to have supported Australia – which is where he is now heading, with reports Down Under that the 18-year-old is poised to sign for Queensland Reds. Tupou came to wider prominence in May when his power running and try-scoring exploits for Sacred Heart School in Auckland became a worldwide internet sensation. He was asked to sign a loyalty agreement with the New Zealand Rugby Union, but refused to do so and is now set to move across the Tasman Sea. The All Blacks have often benefited from an influx of Polynesian talent, but this is a monstrous prospect from the islands who is on course to torment them in years to come, on behalf of the Wallabies. Taniela Tupou is a 21-stone prop whose school videos have become an internet sensation . Last Word – There was no doubt in the minds of Northampton supporters at Franklin’s Gardens last Friday; Gloucester hooker Richard Hibbard dived to win a penalty. That was certainly the impression in real time and when the incident was replayed. The Welsh Lion collided with rival Dylan Hartley, there was a fleeting pause then he crumpled to the turf. Referee Wayne Barnes was fooled but such theatrics are a creeping trend in the game which must be snuffed out. After last season’s Heineken Cup Final, Springbok wing Bryan Habana chose to apologise for an exaggerated fall which Saracens captain Steve Borthwick denounced at the time as ‘embarrassing’. Habana duly noted that ‘sportsmanship and integrity’ are central pillars of rugby’s appeal, but they will soon collapse if mass, football-style deceit becomes the norm. Hibbard is a tough bloke, as amply demonstrated in the Lions’ demolition of Australia in Sydney last year. It is beneath him, Habana and others to act as con artists. Richard Hibbard of Gloucester  is treated by physios after his supposed hit from Dylan Hartley .","Saracens chief executive Edward Griffiths' comments about the play-off system being generated by money are surely beyond doubt .

"England have cleared Owen Farrell and Billy Vunipola to fly out to New Zealand, despite the two Saracens players limping off during Saturday’s Aviva Premiership final. Head coach Stuart Lancaster and his assistants watched the match at their Auckland hotel and would have been alarmed by the sight of their leading  fly-half and No 8 struggling with injuries. However, following urgent assessments, the pair were deemed fit to join the squad ahead of the three-Test series against the All Blacks. Farrell was withdrawn from the fray in some discomfort after kicking the ball into the crowd to celebrate scoring a try which was subsequently ruled out. Vunipola was limping and holding his ankle before being replaced, but Lancaster played down the double scare. Down: Owen Farrell injured himself after kicking the ball away in celebration of a try that was disallowed . ‘We left a medical team in London,’ he said. ‘They assessed the players and everyone has come through unscathed, give or take bumps and bruises. It was cramp for Billy rather than anything more serious. Owen was cramp as well.’ The build-up to the tour has been blighted by injury setbacks and the fixture clash which means those players who took part in the Premiership final cannot be considered for the first Test. As the series approaches, the condition of several players remains a worry. ‘Joe Marler will be fine to train,’ said Lancaster, in reference to the Quins prop who was nursing a hip injury. ‘Tom Johnson picked up a bit of an ankle injury. Billy Twelvetrees still hasn’t trained fully. We’ll see how he progresses. I wouldn’t say he’s doubtful yet, but the clock is ticking.’ On the plane: Billy Vunipola has been cleared to join up with the England squad in New Zealand . The front row has been an area of particular concern to the coaches, who will be without their first-choice props, Alex Corbisiero and Dan Cole, against New Zealand. Many of the obvious understudies have been sidelined too and Lancaster added: ‘Mako Vunipola has had surgery, so is out of the tour. Rob Webber’s knee is good and he will train. ‘Dylan Hartley got on at around 60 minutes in the final and played the extra-time as well. He seemed to come through fine and he’ll be on the plane.’ The opening clash with the world champions at Eden Park is shaping up as a major examination of England’s resources below the first-choice XV, as so many of those men will be unavailable. Defeat: An understrength English side were beaten by the Barbarians at Twickenham on Sunday . But after naming a powerful 31-man squad featuring recalled back-rowers Jerome Kaino and Victor Vito, All Blacks coach Steve Hansen warned England pose a serious threat. ‘They have been the most improved side in world rugby in the last two years,’ he said. ‘Those who think England will be fielding a weak side in the first Test are completely underestimating the depth in the England squad. They have a very strong belief that they can win this series. ‘Having said that, so do the All Blacks.’","Both Farrell and Vunipola injured during Aviva Premiership final .
England begin three-Test series against New Zealand next weekend ."
"Rugby's authorities have been warned that they risk creating a culture of diving in the game, due to the way that acts of foul play are being refereed. Last month, this column highlighted the spectre of ‘simulation’ – as it has become known in football – taking hold as players seek to con officials into awarding penalties and dishing out cards. Now, that threat has been reinforced by Leicester’s director of rugby, Richard Cockerill, in light of a contentious incident last Saturday. London Irish's Blair Cowan (left) escaped a citing last weekend because of Jamie Gibson's lack of reaction . The Tigers were incensed when no action was taken against Blair Cowan of London Irish for punching their flanker, Jamie Gibson, in the face at Welford Road. Jamie Gibson was on the receiving end from Cowan when Leicester faced London Irish . Having sought clarification, Cockerill was stunned to be informed by the RFU that referee Greg Garner was entitled to down-play the offence on the basis that the victim did not appear to be hurt. In return, he expressed concerns that this out-look will lead to the spread of diving. ‘In law, I am told that a punch is down to the referee’s interpretation, so the referee will decide whether it is a hard or a soft punch,’ said Cockerill. ‘The referee and the TMO at the weekend decided that the punch to Gibson’s face didn’t hurt him and wasn’t hard. ‘I had an email from Gerard McEvilly (RFU disciplinary officer) and Wade Dooley (citing officer) who said it wasn’t even a level-one citing, which is when it should have been a yellow card. One of the comments that alarmed me the most is that Gibson didn’t need treatment and didn’t go to the floor. ‘Well, it didn’t really hurt Gibson so it is alright. How do you know it has not cracked his cheekbone or his jaw? The 50 year-old bloke sat in the TMO caravan outside is dictating whether someone gets hurt when they get punched. ‘The encouragement would be that if you get punched then go to the floor, get treatment and the player will get sent off. So now the law-makers are actually encouraging you to dive and I said that is the thin end of the wedge.’ The RFU have re-affirmed their conviction that this particular case was handled correctly – with the citing commissioner concluding that a penalty was sufficient for a weak punch which made minimal contact and did not provoke any response from Gibson. The union have also noted that Leicester did not make an official complaint about the matter and the governing body reject the notion that this sort of episode will provoke increasing levels of play-acting. Cockerill fears that the laws could leave to the type of diving seen in football, shown here by Ashley Young . However, asked if he feared that this officiating issue would lead to coaches instructing their players to engage in simulation, Cockerill added: ‘You wouldn’t, but it is getting to that point.’ This policy towards the appraisal of foul play must be amended urgently. Cockerill’s point is valid, as diving is a minor, occasional problem for now, but this situation could lead to it becoming a real blight on the game. The notion that a full-blooded punch to the face that causes no immediate, obvious damage is more acceptable than a glancing blow that happens to draw blood is absurd. The game is in an officiating hole due to guidelines issued to referees which remove the common-sense element of discretion, especially when it comes to the safety-first minefield of dangerous tackles. But in this case, the discretionary powers appear mis-placed. It would be disastrous for rugby if taking a tumble and feigning an injury was the only guaranteed route to justice. Last weekend, Sam Burgess was congratulated on reaching the Australian NRL Grand Final by his perennial Kiwi adversary, Sonny Bill Williams, who said: ‘See you on the dark side’ – in reference to their mutual code switch. Williams has played union before and will slot straight back into the All Blacks set-up, whereas Burgess is preparing for an accelerated education in the 15-man game as he targets a World Cup call-up by England. Sonny Bill Williams will go straight back into the All Blacks side as he moves back to Union for the World Cup . Sam Burgess, tackled by three men, is also making the switch to Union in time for the 2015 World Cup . He may wish to make the transition under the radar but there is no chance of that. Bath have released the first in a series of promotional trailers, entitled ‘The Countdown Begins’ as they prepare to welcome the league icon later this month. With the backdrop of a Roman arena and a heart-beat soundtrack, it shows Burgess in explosive action and heralds his credentials; both his physical stature and his sensational recent match stats. He is depicted as an unstoppable force of nature and his new club will hope that they soon have similar footage of Burgess scattering opponents in their colours. The transition will be televised. The pressure is on. While they await their high-profile new recruit, Bath have more pressing business on Friday night as they face Saracens in an intriguing Aviva Premiership encounter at The Rec. Both clubs are among the early front-runners in the league and destined to feature in the title tussle next May. Both have recently ‘nilled’ leading rivals in stunning fashion – Bath beating Leicester 45-0 and Saracens’ winning 39-0 away to Harlequins. There is unlikely to be a solitary zero on the scoreboard by the end of this match. Saracens have made a superb start to the season but will be in for a tough test against high-flying Bath . Bath have promoted Gavin Henson to start at full back and England wing Anthony Watson is poised to make an injury comeback from the bench. Saracens must operate their fabled ‘Wolf- pack’ defence without the influential presence of Brad Barritt, who has a minor calf injury, while Owen Farrell is also absent again. This column – without overwhelming conviction – predicts a narrow Bath win. While Williams and Burgess prepare for life in union, maverick Australian back Kurtley Beale may be on his way to league after the latest in a sequence of personal controversies. Having had his run-ins with the authorities several times before and struggled with alcohol-related issues, the gifted Waratahs play-maker has been dropped by the Wallabies for tomorrow’s Rugby Championship clash with Argentina. Kurtley Beale is alleged to have fallen out with a member of the Australian staff after playing South Africa . This follows allegations of a heated row with a team official on a flight from South Africa to South America – an incident that has been referred to Australia’s ‘integrity unit’ and has side-tracked head coach Ewen McKenzie from the primary task of preparing his side to face the Pumas. The up-shots are that Argentina have surely their best chance yet of securing a maiden tournament win and Beale’s future is in jeopardy. It would be a shame if the game were to lose such a precocious talent, but the benefit of the doubt can only be applied so many times… . Kurtley Beale is a fantastic talent but he has already been given the benefit of the doubt several times . England’s coaches were awarded new contracts through to 2020, just days after Jake White left the Durban-based Sharks – reportedly with a view to being available if a Test job comes up after the World Cup. The South African who guided his country to global glory in 2007 has been interested in coaching England before. The role has great cachet and if Lancaster’s team collapsed in a heap next year (highly unlikely), the RFU would need to assess whether there were viable alternatives before dispensing with the current coaches, at great expense. Stuart Lancaster and his assistants have been given new long-term contracts ahead of the World Cup . These days, every union is expected to conduct a ‘worldwide search’ for the right man, amid a perception that there are always various stellar options overseas. In truth, White is one of very few, but his gold-plated CV doesn’t boast a forensic knowledge of English rugby. His compatriot, Nick Mallett, has surely been away from the game’s front line for too long to be a contender again. Kiwi coaches are an export trade in their own right, but it is unlikely the RFU would try to poach Warren Gatland from Wales or Joe Schmidt from Ireland. The grass is not necessarily greener elsewhere. World Cup winner Jake White left the Sharks in the hope that he could take over a Test side after 2015 .","Referees and TMOs deciding on severity of a punch by player's reaction .

The question is will the FA charge Costa with violent conduct? To do so they have to check ref Michael Oliver didn't see it. Martin Skrtel appears to make contact with Costa's right leg as the ball gets away from the in-form forward . PENALTY KICK? Martin Skrtel appears to bring down Costa in the area in the 23rd minute but Oliver gives a goal-kick. Sky pundit Thierry Henry said at half-time: 'Skrtel doesn't need to commit, the referee had a clear view and didn't give a penalty.' POLL'S VERDICT: Jose Mourinho can have a Justifiable moan about the 'campaign' against Chelsea after Costa is clearly fouled by Skrtel. Oliver has a clear view but awards a goal-kick when it should have been a penalty. Jose Mourinho believes there has been a campaign against his side when it comes to penalties this season . HALF-TIME RAGE . Outraged by Oliver's decision not to award Costa a penalty, Mourinho confronted the referee in the tunnel at half-time and had to be shepherded away by fourth official Phil Dowd. POLL'S VERDICT: If they did their jobs, the officials would report Mourinho. Managers are not allowed to do this. Mourinho talks to referee Michael Oliver in the tunnel at half-time after being angered by his decisions . SECOND STAMP . Costa and Skrtel tangle again in the 54th minute. This time the Chelsea striker stamps on the defender's foot when the pair chase a loose ball and Skrtel retaliates by swinging his foot at Costa. POLL'S VERDICT: I'd give Costa the benefit of the doubt as he was airborne and had to land somewhere. But both players should have been cautioned as they went head to head. Costa lands on Skrtel's left foot as he runs after the ball during the second period at Stamford Bridge . Martin Skrtel of Liverpool argues with Diego Costa of Chelsea, as the pair continually clashed on Tuesday night . HEAD TO HEAD . Costa tussles with Steven Gerrard in the 12th minute of extra-time and puts his hand over the Liverpool captain's face. The pair go head to head and are both booked. POLL'S VERDICT: Having decided not to caution Costa and Skrtel, he gave yellow cards to Costa and Gerrard when they repeated the head-to-head act. Costa puts his hand around Steven Gerrard's face as the pair wrestle during the opening period of extra-time .

"When Leicester brought Steve Mafi over to England in 2010, he had been released by the Sydney-based Waratahs, amid concerns about his inability to add bulk to a naturally lean frame. His career was going nowhere in a hurry, but that has all changed. The Tigers helped him put on weight the right way and he was a revelation in their pack; as an athletic, versatile lock or flanker. Having grown up Down Under in a Tongan family, he was duly picked to represent the Pacific-island nation and has gone on to earn 10 Test caps. Yet, having last made an international appearance in June, he may next re-surface in the gold shirt of the Wallabies. Gone: Former Leicester forward Steve Mafi has left for Australia to try and pursue a career with the Wallabies . Dual: Mafi has already played for Tonga, however, raising the possibility of international-level transfer window . Mafi didn’t return to Leicester for pre-season and despite still being contracted to the East Midlands club, he signed for Western Force in Perth. There were family reasons, but also a wish to play for Australia. That is hardly outrageous given that he was born and raised there, but it shouldn’t be possible because he has already been capped by another country. But the goalposts have shifted, paving the way for an alarming transformation of the Test rugby landscape. In time, there could be an international-level transfer market, with players willingly auctioning themselves to the highest bidder. Over the summer, it emerged that Steffon Armitage could play for France if England continue to ignore him. The Toulon flanker may have the option to capitalise on a loophole in the IRB’s eligibility criteria designed to enhance the Sevens tournament at the 2016 Rio Olympics. Players who have represented one country are no longer exempt from representing another, providing they have the requisite passport and have not been capped for 18 months. This amendment was doubtless put in place with the best intentions of aiding smaller nations, but the result is sure to be an unseemly farce. Star man: Steffon Armitage, who has already been capped by England, could yet play for France in the future . Prepare for widespread abuse of a highly vulnerable ‘system’. Mafi can qualify for Australia in time for the OIympics, then go on to chase 15-a-side selection. Meanwhile, Tonga lose a top player to a richer rival. French rugby is awash with foreign talent and ‘Les Bleus’ are struggling so much that there will be a growing temptation to cynically recruit overseas players; capped or not. It is just a matter of patience and using lawyers to drive a tank through feeble regulations. One day, England may consider the ploy too. For the right fee and paperwork, Japan could hire their very own All Black. Tonga, Fiji and Samoa rely on players with dual citizenship, many of whom will carry New Zealand passports. When a rookie sensation emerges in the colours of one of those countries, what is to stop them being poached? A committee will be tasked with preventing malpractice, so the long-term welfare of the Test game may be reliant on anonymous ‘suits’ and the juggling of myriad agendas. Rugby’s eligibility criteria were already too lax, without this short-cut to chaos. A can of worms is wide open. Way out: A loophole exists in the IRB's eligibility rules whereby players can switch after a sevens tournament . Kicking off the season with a bang . The new season is destined to begin with an almighty bang. At Franklin’s Gardens on Friday night, revamped Gloucester will set about inflicting an early blow to Northampton’s hopes of retaining their Aviva Premiership title. Two head-to-head duels stand out. England hooker Dylan Hartley faces the man he would have challenged for the Lions No 2 shirt, if a ban hadn’t deprived him of a tour place; Richard Hibbard of Wales. In midfield, Luther Burrell and Billy Twelvetrees will aim to out-do each other in a preliminary audition for the inside-centre berth in the national team. Title: Defending Premiership champions Northampton kick off their defence by hosting Gloucester on Friday . On Saturday, the annual London Double Header will draw a vast curtain-raiser crowd to Twickenham. Yet, it is not just the top flight that will generate opening-weekend intrigue. The Championships starts with a heavyweight clash between Bristol and Worcester at Ashton Gate. Barring a play-off upset, those two ambitious clubs are destined to resolve a seismic scrap for promotion in the two-leg final next May. Debut: Wales and British and Irish Lions hooker James Hibbard will make his debut for Gloucester on Friday . Simpson-Daniel's premature retirement a loss for the game . James Simpson-Daniel has been forced by injure to retire prematurely, at the age of 32, and the domestic game will be substantially poorer for his absence. Since he left Jonah Lomu choking in his vapour trails at Twickenham as a precocious teen prospect in 2002, medical setbacks contrived to deprive ‘Sinbad’ of the higher recognition which his talent surely justified. A tally of 10 Test caps does nothing to reflect the majesty of his game as an electric attacking runner. In a sport with a modern template founded on size and power, here was an impish free spirit capable of making a mockery of the giants around him. He stayed true to Gloucester throughout his career and at Kingsholm, where strong forward play is so revered, they will sorely miss his audacious class. Premature: Gloucester back James Simpson-Daniel, 32, was forced to retire last week due to injury . Missed: Simpson-Daniel will a loss to the game as he was an exciting back who scored tries from everywhere . Cyclist drawn into French rugby storm . A French cyclist has been inadvertently dragged into an unseemly public row between the presidents of Toulon and Racing Metro. Prior to last weekend’s clash between their sides, Mourad Boudjellal – the outspoken millionaire who has bank-rolled Toulon – likened his Parisian counterpart, Jacky Lorenzetti, to Raymond Poulidor; known as ‘Eternal Second’ after failing to win the Tour de France despite eight podium finishes. Old school: French cyclist Raymond Poulidor (second left) was used as a comparison by Toulon's president . The riposte was a blatant accusation that European champions Toulon break salary-cap rules, as Lorenzetti, said: ‘The Top 14 cannot be a competition where 13 teams play by the rules of the salary cap and Toulon play by their own rules . 'Clear answers – clear like the water in the bottles of virtuous cyclists – need to be provided by Toulon and their president. No club, not even the champions, should play with a doped wage budget.’ Touche… . Row: Toulon president Mourad Boudjellal is embroiled in an argument with Racing Metro's Jacky Lorenzetti . Last Word . On the basis that there’s no such thing as bad publicity, World Cup organisers will be ecstatic. A video promoting imminent ticket sales for the tournament – featuring actor Charles Dance giving a team talk in a changing-room at Twickenham – has generated a distant storm of indignation, leading to wider coverage. Dance’s motivational address is directed at players past and present, fans, ground staff, musicians and even a chef tending a barbecue. Many nationalities are represented, but not New Zealand. This has been perceived as such a colossal snub by Kiwis that All Black players and coaches have been asked for comment. Apparently, not enough respect has been shown to the world champions. Head-to-head: Southa Africa and Canada rugby stars face off in each other in the promotional video . Passionate: Games of Throne star Charles Dance gives a rousing pep talk in the 2015 World Cup video . Ironically, the video is entitled ‘Too Big to Miss’, which New Zealanders evidently believe should refer to them, not the tournament. There is no sign of any Argentines, Fijians, Japanese or Georgians either, but those countries appear to have taken the oversight in stride. This column can reassure all Kiwis; your team are the world’s best and will be rightly feted here next year, but the sport is about far more than just those fabled black shirts and the Haka.","Steve Mafi has also represented Tonga but could be eligible for Australia too .

"Without doubt the worst foul of the evening was by Paris Saint-Germain’s Marco Verratti on Eden Hazard and replays confirmed my initial thought that the over-the-top tackle should have meant the French side were reduced to 10 men. Turkish referee Cuneyt Cakir merely showed him a yellow card when a red one would have been the proper response. Cakir was understanding and tolerant most of the time and as long as you like the game to be physical he was consistent. PSG's Marco Verratti was only booked following his studs up challenge on Chelsea's Eden Hazard . Marco Verratti goes in with studs showing during PSG's Champions League clash with Chelsea . How was Veratti not sent off for this? The Italian midfielder went in with two feet against Hazard . But if there was anything Chelsea could object to in the referee’s performance it was the continual fouling by former Chelsea player David Luiz, which went unpunished. While he could not be accused of making one really bad challenge, the number of offences he committed meant he should have been subject to disciplinary action. In fact, despite the physical nature of the match, which Cakir was happy to allow most of the time, only four players were booked — two from each side.

"Kevin Pietersen's autobiography  has seemed to be an endless stream of sad score-settling. But while the former England batsman’s claims of a bullying culture are certainly worthy of investigation, it’s KP’s mass of contradictions that leap off the page. Here’s the best (or worst) of them… . England's James Anderson (left) reacts with team-mates Kevin Pietersen (centre) and Graeme Swann after he takes a wicket against India during a Test at Lord's in 2011 . Skating on thing ice . After the removal of Peter Moores and Pietersen’s demotion from the captaincy, England travelled to the West Indies in early 2009. Pietersen relates that he ‘gave it my best’ upon being back in the ranks. ‘I had come to the Caribbean and gone out of my way to make things as smooth as possible for Straussy,’ he insists. Yet within a week of arriving, he was agitating to be allowed home between the third and fourth Tests. The reason: his wife Jessica had chosen to appear in the Dancing On Ice television programme rather than joining other families on tour. Strauss and Flower understandably declined his request. Pietersen in talks with England coach Peter Moores during his first stint in charge in 2008 . Pietersen with his wife Jessica Taylor on the red carpet at the Pride of Britain awards on Sunday night . Who bullies a bully? One of Pietersen’s central claims is that a culture of bullying existed in the England dressing room, particularly among the clique of Matt Prior, James Anderson, Stuart Broad and Graeme Swann. Yet in his book Pietersen is relentless in his contemptuous attitude towards Prior, assassinating his character and constantly ridiculing him with references to his moniker of ‘Cheese’ or ‘Big Cheese’, having a go at everything from his on-field attitude to his cycling obsession. The scale of abuse he directs at Prior appears to be of a persecuting nature itself. How about Pietersen sitting with his mouthpiece Piers Morgan at Lord’s this summer while the broadcaster tweeted about Alastair Cook: ‘We’re watching you captain weasel.’ Is that not bullying? What about Pietersen’s criticism of batsman James Taylor on his debut at Headingley? He did this both to Andy Flower and his team-mates. He also criticised Michael Carberry, a supposed friend, in Sydney as England plunged to a 5-0 defeat. He asked Jonny Bairstow, in front of the team: ‘Is there not anybody better than this bloke in county cricket?’ Pietersen and Matt Prior celebrate winning the Ashes down under in January 2011 . Pietersen (right) in the stands at Lord's earlier this year with his friend Piers Morgan (centre) Petals flowered . The other main target of vitriol is coach Andy Flower, for whom KP makes no secret of his contempt. He also outlines how he was in two minds about his one-day career and wanted to give it up to achieve a better work-life balance and make his career more manageable. Yet in 2011, at the height of all this discussion, he sent an over-friendly email to Flower opening with the line ‘Howsit Petals?’ — the nickname Flower used to have in Zimbabwe, one only really used by southern Africans. In the nauseating email he declared an ambition to be one-day captain but only if Flower stayed on as coach so that they could work together — in contrast to his claim in the book that the pair had not get on ‘ever since 2009’. Pietersen also calls Flower’s coaching into question. He writes: ‘I know you are a dreadful coach not by how you won but by how you lost. Your methods created an environment where people became terrified of failing.’ Yet the facts do not support the idea that Flower was a bad coach, however poor that last tour of Australia. He took England to No 1 in the world in three forms of the game, winning three Ashes series, one of them away, and achieved an away series win in India, admittedly with Pietersen playing his part. Pietersen with former England coach Andy Flower in the nets at Melbourne in December last year . You’d Swann off, too . This week, at one of his public appearances, Pietersen attacked Graeme Swann for quitting the disastrous Ashes tour last winter (but did not do so in his book). According to the batsman ‘a lot of the players felt aggrieved by him jumping ship in the middle of the series. He let the team down. If it was his elbow, fine, but he could have held on for another couple of weeks’. Yet the document about Pietersen’s behaviour compiled by the ECB, which was leaked this week, suggests that he told a member of the medical staff that if the third Test was lost he would use his knee condition as an excuse to go home. Pietersen denies this, although in 2011 he left the World Cup with a hernia problem that tour staff felt was manageable. Soon after returning to London he was spotted in a nightclub. Pietersen and Swann celebrate at the end of the fourth  test against Australia in Melbourne in December 2010 . Tempted by IPl riches . Pietersen has repeatedly said that he did not wish to prioritise the lucrative Indian Premier League at the expense of his England career, while espousing the IPL’s virtues in his cricket development. He has always said that England was his main concern. Yet he asked to fly to India to play in the IPL semi-finals right in the middle of back-to-back Tests against the West Indies at Lord’s and Trent Bridge in 2012. Dressing room tales . In a press conference at the start of the Ashes tour last summer, KP declared that the England camp was a place full of harmony, a united place. ‘We’re all having so much fun. I think we’ll stay friends after cricket,’ he said. ‘We’ve all grown up and the environment now is absolutely fantastic — I’m not lying, I’m being dead straight.’ Yet in the book he says quite the opposite: ‘The dressing room had been awful for years. There were wins and star players, but the dressing room was sick all along.’ First-class puzzle . Pietersen still maintains that it is his wish to play international cricket again and that he hopes certain changes of personnel at the top might help him. ‘If I was offered the opportunity to play Test cricket again for England I would jump at the chance. I dream of playing for England again,’ he says in the book. Yet this summer, when he was contracted to Surrey, he failed to play a single day’s first-class cricket for the county, apparently disappointing his old mentor Graeme Ford. It was a strange way to push the case that he fervently wanted to play Test cricket again. Kevin Pietersen always claimed that England were his main concern rather than the riches of the IPL . Pietersen celebrates with captain Alastair Cook during their Ashes win over Australia last summer . But their relationship turned sour after Pietersen was sacked from the England team last winter . Tweet and sour . KP made much of how the spoof Twitter account @KPGenius upset him and how it led to him breaking down in tears in front of Flower, of all people. Yet Pietersen received requests to stop Piers Morgan tweeting abuse about players, in particular Alastair Cook, to Morgan’s huge audience. When these approaches were made he told his colleagues that they needed a thicker skin. Memory failure . In his book Pietersen insists that he cannot remember the wording of the texts he sent about Andrew Strauss in the episode known as ‘Textgate’. He says he sent them to a friend in the South African team and they were just part of ongoing banter with an old mate. Yet he details conversations that were had with others stretching back several years, including quotes in conversations. Pietersen shares a joke with former England captain Andrew Strauss during the India series in 2011 . A negative image . At the end of his autobiography Pietersen asks: ‘Am I bitter?’ and answers: ‘No, and no again’, insisting (correctly) that he has much to be proud of. Yet his account of his latter years with England focuses heavily on spats with fellow players and is full of justification for his arguments, giving it an almost joyless tone despite it covering a period when England — and he himself — enjoyed plenty of success. Sadly, he dwells on the negative aspects of what happened towards the end of his international career and almost skims over many of his fine achievements.

"Manchester United striker Robin van Persie could have been in severe trouble after appearing to elbow West Ham defender James Tomkins.

"Reputation . and sentiment will be shoved aside in Cardiff this evening as Saracens’ ‘Wolf Pack’ set out to hunt down Jonny Wilkinson and Co and deny the . icon a fitting farewell and claim their own European glory. The . script surely dictates that England’s No 10 hero of the ages concludes . his last appearance on these shores as a champion again, in a Toulon . team who retain their Heineken Cup title. But Saracens do not intend to . yield to this fairytale scenario and in fact they are hell-bent on . honouring their own departing skipper in appropriate fashion. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Farrell praise WIlkinson ahead of Heineken Cup final . Pitch perfect: Jonny Wilkinson took part in Toulon training ahead of their Heineken Cup final vs Saracens . In the zone: Saracens fly-half Owen Farrell practices his place-kicking during their training session on Friday . On . Friday lunchtime, the Aviva Premiership finalists named Steve Borthwick in the second row, which apparently confirmed his recovery from . a pectoral injury. Whether or not the former England captain actually . leads his side on to the Millennium Stadium pitch just before 5pm cannot . be assured until that hour arrives, but his reassuring presence would . provide Saracens with a vital boost. Mark . McCall’s men will ensure Wilkinson will have to contend with a . monumental onslaught in this last instalment of the continent’s . blue-riband event, in its current guise. ‘We are a ferocious team with a . lot of intensity in our defence,’ said full back Alex Goode. ‘We . don’t believe in going in in ones or twos; we hunt as a team. We go . after the opposition and we are relentless in that pursuit of them. Whether that means Jonny or whoever, we keep coming and we keep coming. ‘We . were all pretty young when he won the World Cup with that kick. From . then on he’s been a hero to a lot of English people, but as far as we’re . concerned, we want to put as much pressure as possible on him.’ Top dog: Wilkinson scored all of Toulon's points in last season's 24-12 semi-final victory at Twickenham . That is the mindset which underpins the . Wolf Pack — a term coined by Saracens’ defence coach, Paul Gustard, to . signify the team’s commitment to hunting in numbers, without let-up. Owen Farrell added: ‘The Wolf Pack is what we call our defence. It’s . called the Wolf Pack because wolves hunt better in packs. It is . something we have talked about for a long time. The strength of the wolf . is in the pack. That’s how we operate.’ Under the closed roof, . Saracens will go big-game, big-name hunting, driven on by the ferocity . of their Namibian flanker, Jacques Burger, whose thunderous tackling and . breakdown work inspired the semi-final rout of Clermont Auvergne. He . and his team-mates will have to reach such stupendous heights again if . they are to deny a Toulon line-up laden with international glitterati. The Cote d’Azur club are favourites — 4-6 with Ladbrokes, while Saracens are the 6-5 outsiders. So . much attention will focus on the Wilkinson v Farrell contest at No 10; a . repeat of last year’s semi-final head to head which was comfortably won . by the veteran and his team. Winning smile: Wilkinson (centre) is looking for successive Heineken Cup successes with Toulon . Eyes on the prize: Farrell is looking to win his first Heineken Cup in Saturday's final against Toulon . Pass master: England international Farrell will face World Cup winner Jonny Wilkinson in a fly-half battle . That game yielded the memorable image . of Wilkinson consoling his young rival after landing  a quick-reaction . drop goal. Recalling the incident, Farrell said: ‘We put pressure on him . for his drop goal and he managed to get it over. I think my words were . “There’s no way you got that over” because I hadn’t seen it — I couldn’t . see the posts. He said, “Sorry”. That was it!’ Wilkinson also . relived the moment when he patted Farrell on the head, adding: ‘It was a . gesture of respect and I think he understood that perfectly. ‘I . knew chance would play a big part in that drop goal and the  gesture was . to show my respect, like in tennis when a shot hits the net and drops . over the other side. I just wanted to say sorry because that’s what I . felt.’ Toulon have come to Wales armed with a multitude of  weapons, . from Bryan Habana to Matt Giteau, Carl Hayman in the scrum, fearsome . locks in Bakkies Botha and Danie Rossouw, the magnificent Puma captain .

Sitting pretty: Saracens full-back Alex Goode looks on during practice at the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff . But Wilkinson is the ringmaster and talisman, as his . coach,  Bernard Laporte, made clear when he said: ‘After we (France) lost against England at Twickenham a few years, I said, “We have Zidane . and they have Wilkinson”. I was right. We are happy to have him.’ The . fabled fly-half may have played in two World Cup finals and on two . Lions tours, but in keeping with his emphasis on the here and now, he . said: ‘Just as with every other game, this game is the  biggest game of . my career. As far as I am concerned, next week (French Top 14 league . final) doesn’t exist at the moment and neither does what’s gone before. ‘The . thought of leaving this final without a happy ending is a painful one, . so we have to make sure that it doesn’t end like that.’ If Saracens . have their way, that is exactly how it will end — with the UK leg of . Wilkinson’s farewell party well and truly spoiled. That’s the vision, . but despite their  heroics against Clermont it is still difficult to . envisage. Toulon have sufficient power and class to give their idol his dream send-off.","Wilkinson to play in his last game in Britain before retiring .

"Five Tests between an England team who have forgotten how to win and an Indian one usually only victorious at home will decide the captaincy fate of Alastair Cook over the next six, highly-congested weeks. Crunch time for a captain under intense pressure arrives in the  form of one of the most condensed  five-Test series of all time that begins today at a Trent Bridge ground where England normally swing their way to victory. Certainly, in just 42 days at the Kia Oval it will be known whether Cook has come through the biggest test yet of his undoubted strength and remains the man to lead England in their attempt to win back the Ashes next summer. VIDEO Scroll down to see Cook discuss his form ahead of India test series . Under pressure: England captain Alastair Cook with coach Peter Moores . In need of runs: Cook knows he has been failing with the bat . Preparing: The captain knows that he needs runs and wins to save his role . Judgment on Cook may come sooner if England, without a win in eight Tests, suffer a repeat of their Nottingham defeat in the 2007 ‘jelly bean’ Test against India, or at a Lord’s ground next week where they could not get past Sri Lanka. Cook is nothing if not a fighter and there was a quiet determination about him yesterday, as he weighed up a series that has assumed exaggerated importance through England’s failure to beat the Sri Lankans in all formats. ‘Until the day the selectors decide I’m not the right man for the job, I will continue to do it,’ said Cook, when asked if his captaincy could survive a series defeat by an Indian team who have gone 14 Tests without an away win — stretching back to before they were hammered 4-0 by England three years ago. ‘It is a huge honour to do this and I can sleep knowing I throw everything I’ve got into it. ‘I’m not in charge of when I go and I will continue to concentrate on the job I was asked to do. I’m incredibly proud to be England captain.’ The pressure on Cook, in truth, has more to do with the fact that he has not reached 30 in his past six innings and is without a century in 25 knocks, rather than the tactical shortcomings that were so evident on the fourth day in Leeds. ‘I know how important it is at the top of the order to score runs and I’m desperately keen to lead from the front,’ he added. ‘No one’s more determined than me to put it right and I’ve worked very hard over the last 10 days.’ Spills: Cook has had an incredibly troubling run at the helm of the England team . Face off: They are set to play India (with captain MS Dohni pictured) in a five test series this summer . The ECB are just as desperate for Cook to come through the most torrid test of his mettle as he is himself, but they have not helped him with a crammed itinerary that will test the fitness and durability of his two key bowlers. Trent Bridge is the most productive ground for Jimmy Anderson, who took 10 wickets in last year’s thrilling win over Australia here, and Stuart Broad, who claimed a hat-trick on home turf here against India three years ago. Yet both looked out on their feet by the end of those two long, hard Tests against Sri Lanka and the key to this Investec series may lie with the pair’s fitness and ability to hit the ground running before India’s batsmen find their feet. ‘I can’t remember two games going as deep as that,’ said Cook of Tests against Sri Lanka that went to the last and penultimate balls. ‘Broady’s knee can get a bit sore and Jimmy is over 30 now, so he can pull up a bit worse than he did when he was younger. We will know more about them as the series develops.’ Leading the attack: England bowlers Stuart Broad and James Anderson during net practice . Team talk: The England squad in practice ahead of the first Test against India at Trent Bridge . To that end, England picked two extra seamers in their 13-man squad with a view to preparing all of them for battle over the coming weeks. It seems certain that Ben Stokes will come in for the unlucky Chris Jordan today, with the perennial substitute Chris Woakes remaining on the bench for now. England need to somehow get the gifted Stokes back in the team now he has regained full fitness and fluency. He was particularly impressive with the ball in the nets yesterday, causing  problems for Sam Robson and Joe Root. There was also an unscheduled appearance at practice for Jos Buttler, called up as cover after Matt Prior reported a tight thigh, but Cook said that he was ‘99 per cent certain’ that his senior keeper- batsman would be fully fit today. Prior certainly seemed fine in lengthy keeping  sessions yesterday but another injury scare is a concern for a man with a chronic Achilles problem who might find the workload over the next six weeks  as hard as Anderson and Broad will. It is the senior players who Cook badly needs to perform for him here because the paradox of England’s predicament is that the team is now brimming with achieving youngsters seemingly ready to prosper in the new era. Coming in: Ben Stokes is set to replace Chris Jordan in the England side . Cover: Jos Buttler (left) has been brought in as cover for wicketkeeper Matt Prior . VIDEO Cook focused on form change . England are not the only team in transition. India are rebuilding under MS Dhoni without Sachin Tendulkar, Rahul Dravid, VVS Laxman, Virender Sehwag et al but there is no doubting the quality in a batting line-up featuring the contrasting skills of Virat Kohli and Cheteshwar Pujara. There is more uncertainty over the Indian bowling that sees only the erratic Ishant Sharma with  previous Test experience in England. It is an attack against which Cook should be able to add to his  average of 55 when playing India. It was against India that Cook hit his career best 294 at Edgbaston three years ago. The memories of that golden summer, which saw Andrew Strauss’s England at their peak — and of those in India where Cook led his side to a 2-1 success after going one down — offer encouragement to the captain. How Cook needs runs and a victory in Nottingham. More than ever before. ENGLAND (probable): Cook (capt), Robson, Ballance, Bell, Root, Moeen, Prior (wkt), Stokes, Broad, Plunkett, Anderson.

"You can never say there is nobody else who could do the job, reasons Nasser Hussain, and cites how Michael Vaughan surprised him in becoming an excellent England captain, despite not showing leadership potential while in the ranks. Yet I still maintain there are no viable alternatives right now to succeed Alastair Cook, which not only raises doubts about the ECB’s succession plan but also begs the question: where have all the captains gone? There is no question England want Joe Root to be the next England captain. But they did not expect it to be now, not when he is only 23 with just 19 Tests to his name. And not when he has captained in only one first-class match, which ended with Middlesex chasing 472 to beat his Yorkshire team at Lord’s. Right person, wrong time: Root is too . young to be England captain . A huge problem in the otherwise progressive world of central contracts is England’s best young players do not receive the leadership experience at county level that traditionally stood them in such good stead with England. Instead they spend the bulk of their time coming through the age-group and Lions system, and now Root finds himself potentially two Test defeats away from becoming England captain while woefully short of the proper grounding. England are acutely aware of the problem. They wanted Root to captain the Lions in New Zealand the winter before last, but such was his progress he was fast-tracked into the full England set-up before then. He was in charge when the Lions played New Zealand at Leicester last season but even that avenue of experience is restricted, with the counties reluctant to release players for the second string during the domestic season. Not too long ago England appeared to have identified a captain of the future in Yorkshire’s Andrew Gale and for a while he led the Lions with distinction, as well as becoming an impressive captain of the White Rose county. Under pressure: England captain Alastair Cook after winless streak of 10 Test matches . VIDEO I will not walk away - Cook . Trouble is, Gale’s batting has not progressed as well as his captaincy and it has become clear that while Yorkshire are in contention for the championship it does not look as if their skipper will ever be good enough to play at Test level. Equally, it has been suggested Chris Read, a successful captain with Nottinghamshire, could be a short-term replacement for Cook, but England do not want to go back to an experienced keeper rather than the exciting Jos Buttler. It leaves England knowing that if the worst happens and Cook’s position really does become untenable over the next three Tests they will have little choice other than to throw Root in at the deep end. What other options are there? Matt Prior was Cook’s right-hand man but has now gone, while the unofficial vice-captain Ian Bell is surely unsuited to higher office, particularly while he cannot buy a run himself. Ask anyone involved in the England bonding trip a couple of years back — which saw Bell make a total hash of his leadership task — whether he really could take on the mantle of captain of his country. There is no point either in considering Stuart Broad or Jimmy Anderson because they are out on their feet due to their workload and could not possibly take on the responsibility of the captaincy, too. Short of options: Unofficial vice-captain Ian Bell has not shown the right qualities to be skipper . There is an intriguing possibility from outside in Eoin Morgan, who looks an instinctive captain, but he would be under enormous pressure from the start if he had to prove himself both as a skipper and Test batsman. Better to give Morgan the one-day captaincy if Cook has to go at the end of this Test series and see how he copes with that first. It will not help their predicament now but there is a way the ECB could try to create a new generation of potential captains and it comes from a suggestion made to me this week by one of the leading county chairmen. He wants it made mandatory for every county to have a captain who is qualified for England and I would go further and say they should also be under 25 so they have potential to grow into an England player and captain. It would need the co-operation and patience of the counties, but they must remember the health of the domestic game is almost totally dependent on the health of the national side. For the sake of England they should not appoint overseas players or even senior English ones as their captains in future. If each county had a young, English captain then surely England will have many more candidates to choose from when, say, Root the England captain is struggling for runs and is being criticised for his field placings in five years’ time. Last word . Amid all the England gloom it may have gone unnoticed that Jonathan Trott scored his first century  since returning to first-class cricket with Warwickshire. And he had to withstand a spell of short-pitched bowling on Wednesday from Sussex’s England paceman Chris Jordan, too. 99? No, it was a 100: Jonathan Trott cools down with an ice-cream after scoring 106 . It does not matter at this stage whether the  33-year-old might play for England again. It is simply that, after all he has been through, it is absolutely fantastic to see him back. VIDEO Cook still committed as captain .","Joe Root is the right man but it's the wrong time .

"Cricket’s moral code is mazy at the best of times but it has rarely appeared more complex than in the mixed reaction to the controversial and unusual ‘Mankading’ of Jos Buttler by Sri Lanka at Edgbaston. Opinions among pundits and the public seem evenly divided on whether Sachithra Senanayake was within his rights to run Buttler out backing up and, more pertinently, whether Angelo Mathews should have withdrawn the appeal. Your gut instinct as a cricket lover to any ‘spirit of the game’ issue is as good a means as any of deciding your viewpoint. My mind was made up as soon as Michael Gough raised his finger in the deciding one-day international. It was just wrong. It felt that way then and it still does now after much contemplation. 'Mankad': Jos Buttler (right) is run out backing up by Sachithra Senanayake, sparking a storm of controversy . Flashpoint: England captain Alastair Cook (left) lectures Sri Lanka skipper Angelo Mathews (second right) as Ian Bell (right) and James Tredwell also get involved at Edgbaston . This is not a case of simply backing . England and I am fully aware that Sri Lanka had warned Buttler and broke . no laws or regulations. But ‘Mankading’ feels different from any issue . of non-walking or other  run-out controversies. For . instance, I strongly criticised England for not calling Grant Elliott . back when he was run out at The Oval in 2008 after colliding with Ryan . Sidebottom. There was just no way they could justify that piece of poor . sportsmanship. I also felt . that India had no need to call Ian Bell back at Trent Bridge three years . ago because he had been dozy in the extreme in wandering off for tea . when it was unclear that the ball had crossed the boundary and was dead. Yet . I had no issue with Stuart Broad’s non-walk in last year’s Ashes and . feel that selective walking, as we have seen from some big figures in . the game’s history who have shamefully claimed the moral high ground, is . a bigger offence. Leading question: Cook and Mathews had words at the end following the Sri Lankan skipper's decision not to call Buttler back following the controversial 'Mankad' Confusing? Well, yes, but each incident has to be treated on its merits. So why is . this one so bad? In his  distinctive way, Graeme Swann hit the nail on . the head when he tweeted: ‘I did a Mankad on Marc Snell against . Middlesex Under 11s. It was given out but my dad told me he wished I was . adopted, he was so disgusted.’ The . reaction of Swann Snr is one that will resonate with  any coach or . schoolteacher in charge of a youth game.  Parents: what would you say if . your kid ‘Mankaded’ someone in their next game and then said, ‘It’s OK, . I saw it on TV in  England’s match?’ I hope you would put them up for . adoption as Swann almost was, because it is unedifying and shabby. The . biggest irony, of course, is that India withdrew a Mankad appeal in a . one-day international two years ago. Who were the opponents? Sri Lanka. Who was at the crease? Angelo Mathews. Yet that did nothing to influence . the Sri Lankan captain, even though he was surrounded by senior . players when Gough asked him if he wanted to withdraw the appeal. You've got to go: Umpire Michael Gough (left) gives Buttler out after his run out by Senanayake (right) What . is clear is that the incident has added spice to the Test series. Alastair Cook said Sri Lanka had crossed a line and that there would be a . hangover at next week’s first Test at Lord’s, but it was the press . conference which followed Cook’s on Tuesday night that was most . illuminating. The highly . respected and experienced Mahela Jayawardene bristled on behalf of his . captain, his team and, significantly, his bowler Senanayake. The key to . this issue is that Sri Lanka feel wronged over the reporting of . Senanayake for a suspect bowling action and that, I believe, led them to . running out Buttler in the way they did. The . inference is that they suspect an English conspiracy against . Senanayake and there was implied criticism of umpire Ian Gould from Sri . Lanka team manager Michael de Zoysa, who was alongside Jayawardene at . Edgbaston. Clearly, two simmering teams will head to Lord’s next week. Against the spirit of the game: Grant Elliott (left) should have been called by by England following his run out after this collision with Ryan Sidebottom in 2008 . England may have lost only 3-2 against the world’s most consistently successful limited-overs team but much of their batting was old-fashioned and formulaic, while a lot of the seam bowling lacked discipline and penetration. While England laboured at Edgbaston, Alex Hales was smashing 18 fours and six sixes in his 167 for Notts at Hove. He really does need to be included in a one-paced England 50-over top four before another World Cup comes and goes with a minimal English contribution.

"It was, in a nutshell, all you need to know about cricket’s attitude to its ongoing fight against corruption. Proof, if any were needed, that the priorities of the world governing body towards the  biggest threat to the game’s health and credibility are totally and woefully wrong. When David Richardson, who has remained invisible during his two-year reign as chief executive of the International Cricket Council, finally spoke about the latest crisis gripping the game late on Tuesday, his words were revealing. This was not, as you might expect, recognition of the gravity of the issues enveloping Chris Cairns and Lou Vincent and a clear statement of the action that the ICC will soon take on the guilty players involved in match and spot fixing in numerous countries, including England. Instead, Richardson’s ‘interview’ with . his own employers - hardly Paxman-style interrogation, then - seemed . intent solely on launching a ‘thorough investigation’ into how the . testimony of New Zealand captain Brendon McCullum, revealed in . Sportsmail by Ed Hawkins, came into the public domain. Finally: ICC chief executive David Richardson has broken his silence on recent cricket corruption scandals . Priorities: Richardson is more intent on investigating how the testimony of Brendan McCullum was leaked than fighting this blight on the sport . No mention, you will notice, as to why the much-derided ICC anti-corruption unit have failed to land a significant conviction in 14 years. No mention about any positive action against those responsible for Vincent’s crimes. Clearly, as far as Richardson is concerned, cricket supporters should not learn about the depth of corruption in the world game from information leaked to journalists. So let’s all shoot the messenger then, Mr Richardson, and give further ammunition to cynics who suspect the whole sordid business will be brushed under the carpet. By Richardson’s logic, journalists like Hawkins, the leading authority on corruption in cricket, and Lawrence Booth, who revealed in December that New Zealanders Cairns, Vincent and Daryl Tuffey were being investigated by the ICC, should be hamstrung and the game will continue to give the appearance that it is wallowing in a mess of its own creating. If it were not so serious it would be laughable. It is worth remembering that cricket has almost always had to rely on outside influences to sort out its mucky affairs rather than taking strong, clear, decisive action of its own. Controversy: Lou Vincent admits being involved in plans to fix games and more names are expected to emerge . If it were not for the Indian police then Richardson’s old South Africa team-mate Hansie Cronje would never have been exposed as the calculating cheat that he was. And if it were not for the defunct News of the World newspaper then it is almost certain that Salman Butt, Mohammad Asif and Mohammad Amir would never have been held to account for the offences that led to them going to prison in England. Even the conviction of Mervyn Westfield for spot fixing in county cricket came about only when his then Essex team-mate Tony Palladino bravely stepped forward to expose his friend rather than through detective work from the ICC. If the authorities could be trusted to bring the guilty to account then there would be no need for leaks and no need for sports journalists to become involved in the most difficult story-gathering process in our profession. Shoot the messenger: It took a newspaper investigation to lift the lid on offenses committed by former Pakistan cricket captain Salman Butt (right), who was convicted and jailed for match-fixing offences . But leaks happen for a reason and journalists need to be ever vigilant because administrators simply cannot be trusted to weed out the wrong-doers. Those who run the game should spend less time being outraged about the morality of leaking and reassuring its ‘stakeholders’ and more time fretting about the fact that others feel the need to leak in the first place. You are not the only one who is ‘deeply concerned’, Mr Richardson. The majority of us are deeply concerned about what you and your sorry organisation are doing about corruption in cricket. Only when proper convictions come can you start attacking those who seek to reveal the full extent of the sickening problem. The Kia Oval may have been full on Tuesday but there are likely to be plenty of empty seats on Thursday - and at most grounds hosting Sri Lanka this early season. The ECB will ignore attendances at their peril. Yes, England are coming off the back of the winter from hell and, yes, they are lacking, for now, the sort of star quality that Kevin Pietersen in his pomp could produce. But there is more to it. Star power: Alastair Cook's side and their opponents Sri Lanka lack box office drawcards . The cost of watching England is high and there is simply too much international cricket. A consequence is that England have had to rest some of their best players, hence the public’s reluctance to commit to 50-over games before they are sure who’s playing. It is not just on the field that English cricket may have become complacent before the Australian horror show.","ICC CEO Richardson is launching a ‘thorough investigation’ into how the testimony of New Zealand captain Brendon McCullum became public .

"The wicketkeeping double act of  England coaches Peter Moores and Paul Farbrace face a real test in deciding who to pick behind the stumps for the Test series against Sri Lanka. Keepers may be taking over the English game - the ECB’s managing director, Paul Downton, is also a former gloveman - but it is the pivotal Test wicketkeeper-batsman role that could be their biggest quandary. England want Matt Prior to regain the all-important position he was forced to give up after the Ashes were lost in Perth, but  concerns are growing that he will not be fit in time for the first Test at Lord’s on June 12. Brains trust: (From left) England coaches Peter Moores and Paul Farbrace, and captain Alastair Cook . Expert opinion: England assistant coach Paul Farbrace, like Moores, is a former wicketkeeper . First-choice: Matt Prior is England's best keeper-batsman option but may not be fit for the first Test on June 12 . Prior has not kept wicket yet this . season because of his chronic achilles condition and has not even been . able to play as a  specialist batsman since he scored a century in . Sussex’s opening Championship match. He . has two more four-day games in which to prove his fitness and is . adamant that he will be able to play in them - but if he does not come . through it will be intriguing to see where England go next. Yorkshire’s . Jonny Bairstow is the man in possession but appears to have gone . backwards as a keeper and batsman since his  brilliant display against . South Africa at Lord’s two years ago and is recovering from a broken . finger. Jos Buttler is one . of the most exciting talents in the game and is a key figure in . limited-overs  formats but every time his name is mentioned in terms of . Test cricket there seems to come a shaking of heads and mutterings of . ‘not ready’ from those in the know. Moores, . the former Sussex keeper, clearly believes Buttler has Test potential . because he recruited him for Lancashire before he became England coach . again but last week said that,  for now, he saw his charge as a one-day . performer only. Staking his claim: Jonny Bairstow took over from Prior in Australia but hasn't proved himself with the gloves . Talent: Jos Buttler is an exciting prospect but appears earmarked for limited overs honours only . Look beyond . Buttler and Bairstow and England could go anywhere. The modern trend for . a batsman who keeps could see England look at Craig Kieswetter, whose . presence at Somerset led to Buttler heading north, while the coming man, . but not yet, could well be Middlesex’s John Simpson. Unlucky: Essex's James Foster is too good a player to have just seven caps as a keeper-batsman . Steve . Davies seemed to have a golden opportunity to return to the England . set-up this summer but his decision to give up the gloves and play as a . batsman for Surrey would appear to scupper those hopes. All . of which brings us back to the man in the domestic game I consider most . unfortunate not to have had a long career in international cricket. A . man who has long been among the best keepers in the world and a  batsman . good enough to score 19 first-class hundreds. James . Foster, at 34, is as good as ever and supremely fit. Essex feel so . strongly about their captain that coach Paul Grayson contacted Moores . this week to advocate Foster’s Test claims and, to me, it is little . short of a scandal that he has earned just seven Test caps, the last way . back in 2002. So highly do . Essex rate Foster that, Sportsmail understands, they would be prepared . to sacrifice the promising batsman-keeper Ben Foakes when his contract . expires at the end of this season should they be forced to choose . between him and Foster. What’s . more, Foster could be the perfect short-term fix while  England are . waiting for Prior and if he should excel against Sri Lanka, so much the . better. England should have no qualms in throwing him the gloves now. Experience: Foster was England's T20 keeper in 2009 but hasn't played a Test since the 2002 Ashes . Perfect solution: Foster's cool head could be an ideal short-term solution while Prior got back to 100 per cent . The good . I had an opportunity during the one-day international in Aberdeen to talk to Peter Moores and was struck by his terrific enthusiasm. He is really looking forward to the England job. I’m sure, second time around, he will be older and wiser and he came across very impressively. I know one or two senior players didn’t like ‘the method’ when Moores was coach last time but all this bloke wants to do is improve players and teams. Encouraging: David Lloyd (right) was impressed by Moores' enthusiasm to improve England's players . The bad . I'm sure everyone in cricket will spare a thought for Ashley Giles, who suddenly turned up in the Sky commentary box in Durham because he hasn’t got a job any more. He is such a nice bloke and an excellent coach who has found himself on the outside looking in since losing his role as England’s one-day coach last month. He didn’t have a bad word to say about anyone involved in his sacking, on or off air, and he wants to get back to normal with a job inside the game. The bottom line for both these guys is one simple word - results. Outside looking in: Ashley Giles didn't have a bad word to say about anyone with regards to his sacking . Chris Adams, seen as one of the best young coaches until his fall at Surrey, was set to quit cricket before Sri Lanka resurrected his career. Now he’s plotting England’s downfall. Adams, who was captain of the Sussex side that won the Championship under Peter Moores, will spar with his old mentor after Sri Lanka asked him to replace coach Paul Farbrace, who will act as consultant to Moores. Adams, sacked by Surrey last year, said: ‘I was at the point where I was considering doing something away from cricket. I had given myself a set period of time. By the time the English season started, I was thinking, “At some stage you need to look at other things”. Head-to-head: Former Surrey coach Chris Adams is consulting for Sri Lanka against his former coach Peter Moores . Switch: Adams will give the World T20 side the insight they would have received from Farbrace, who's now with the England camp . ‘And I might still do that. The one thing the last year has taught me is that, as passionate and committed as you can be to sport, perhaps there is more to life than cricket. There’s a big world out there and lots of business opportunities.’ Adams, 44, will give Sri Lanka the inside knowledge that they would have received from Farbrace. Adams said: ‘I could never have imagined a few weeks ago I’d be assisting the World Twenty20 champions on the tour of England. ‘Pete played a huge role in my career. This gives me a few weeks to see how he’s operating. We grew a very strong bond and his appointment was no surprise to me. If anyone was going to get two chances with England it was going to be Peter Moores. ‘I am confident that England have appointed the best coach in the country. It will now be down to the impact he and the players have as to whether it’s successful but the combination of Moores and Farbrace is a good one.’ We have heard all the hype and seen the promotional videos. Now we will find out if the ECB’s revamped NatWest Twenty20 Blast can compete with the Indian Premier League and Australian Big Bash when it is relaunched on Friday night. Regular Friday and weekend fixtures will help but the suspicion remains that England have fallen way behind in the form of the sport they gave to the world because of the domestic game’s refusal to embrace the franchise system. This season will decide whether T20 is still sufficiently attractive with 18 counties rather than, say, eight city teams.

"In the final column of the season, the World of Cricket hands out its annual awards for the good, the bad and the ridiculous... Best newcomer . A difficult category with Moeen Ali, Jos Buttler and Chris Jordan all highly commended but it has to be Gary Ballance. It was Graham Gooch who first enthusiastically advocated him but early evidence in Australia left the jury out. Then Peter Moores decided, surprisingly, that he should bat at three for the first Test of the summer and the rest… an average of 60 after his first eight Tests, the first five of them without a victory, with three hundreds and another three half centuries is Bradmanesque and the biggest tribute you can pay to Ballance is that Jonathan Trott has not been missed. Excellent catcher, too. Just has to make sure he leaves his shirt on when visiting Nottingham bars. Fitting in seamlessly: Gary Ballance celebrates one of his three hundreds this summer, against Sri Lanka . Put your shirt on him: Ballance has been superb at No 3 - now he just has to watch himself in nightclubs . Best performer in a leading role . No problem for the judges this time. Has to be Jimmy Anderson. What a season for a man who became man of the series against Sri Lanka despite not being at his very best and ending it in tears after just failing to hang on for a draw at Headingley. Life was just as eventful for Jimmy against India, first when he batted for nearly four hours at Trent Bridge, clashed with Ravindra Jadeja, wasted perfect conditions at Lord’s and then gloriously set new standards in the last three Tests. He stands just three wickets away from Sir Ian Botham’s Test record and is a national treasure. Master of his art: James Anderson set new standards with his seam bowling against India . VIDEO Root and Anderson thrilled with win . Most ill-advised judgment call . MS Dhoni’s obsession with getting Anderson banned for whatever happened away from the public eye in the Trent Bridge pavilion. The Indian captain’s arrogant assumption that he can do what he wants was embarrassingly rejected by judge Gordon Lewis who threw out the serious Level Three charge in just 10 minutes, with around £200,000 wasted on lawyers. Think what good that could have done in grass-roots cricket. Meanwhile, India seemed to lose all focus while concentrating on Dhoni’s righteous indignation and were a rabble by The Oval. Most ill-judged on-field incident . Has to be the ‘Mankading’ of Buttler by Sachithra Senanayake at Edgbaston in an attempt to avenge what Sri Lanka saw as an English conspiracy to report his bowling action. Forget all this business about it being in the rules. It was a crass piece of cricket which spoilt the otherwise highly impressive impression that Angelo Mathews made as a young and ultimately triumphant captain. Mathews, who led his side to victory in all three formats, was definitely both the overseas player and captain of the season. Ill-judged: Sachithra Senanayake 'Mankads' Jos Buttler, which sparked a row between England and Sri Lanka . Hidden gem of the season . Of the many huge decisions that Paul Downton had to make in his first couple of months as managing director one of the best and least heralded was persuading Paul Farbrace to swap the head coach’s job with Sri Lanka to become Moores' assistant in a new coaching line-up. The former Kent director of cricket is the perfect foil for Moores and has quickly become a significant figure in the England set-up. Has a great perspective on the ups and downs of cricketing life, too, after being caught up in the terrorist attack on the Sri Lankan team in Lahore five years ago. Most significant newcomer . Unquestionably Moeen. Went to meet him in a Birmingham school in May and was immediately impressed by his character. In desperate times in the Middle East, Moeen can be such a positive role model for Islam in this country as well as an inspiration for all British Asians. He does not push his religion down anyone’s throats either, as some have suggested, but he is very much a proud, modern Englishman. He can bat and bowl, too. Modern Englishman: Moeen Ali is a positive role model for British Asians... and a good all-rounder, too . Most significant innings . Buttler’s incredible 121 off 74 balls in a losing cause against Sri Lanka at Lord’s was a game changer in so many ways. Before then James Foster was in line to keep wicket in this season’s Tests should Matt Prior not recover full fitness. England understandably gave Prior another chance as part of their senior spine but he was never fully fit and the introduction of Buttler to Test cricket at Southampton was a highly significant moment. He has proved since he can build an innings as well as explode out of the blocks while, with the exception of Old Trafford, his keeping has been outstanding. He really can become England’s answer to Adam Gilchrist. Game changer: Buttler's explosive ODI innings at Lord's paved the way for his Test debut . Prospective most exciting newcomer . Alex Hales has the potential to do for England what David Warner did for Australia, progress from a Twenty20 specialist all the way to dynamic Test opener. But first he will have to prove he can do it in 50-over cricket against India, Sri Lanka and then the World Cup. Five centuries for Notts in all competitions this season show Hales is ready for promotion and he seems to have matured as a character which was necessary when a lack of self-discipline threatened to stall his progress. Most unlucky cricketer not to be called up . Has to be Hales' Notts colleague James Taylor. When he smashed an unbeaten hundred against Middlesex off 55 balls last week in front of not one selector but two in Mick Newell and Angus Fraser his return to the one-day squad seemed assured. But no. There appears to be a theory that he only produces the goods in TV matches. Well, all international games are on the telly. Highly commended in this category is Ravi Bopara – still astonished that he has lost his one-day place. Contrasting fortunes: Alex Hales (left) was finally being selected for England's 50-over squad but his county colleague James Taylor (right, celebrating a ton for the Lions) was unlucky not to be called up . Most impressive county . Yorkshire. They are setting the standards for everyone else to match, not just in leading the way in the county championship but the way they are developing so many players for the England team, including one in Liam Plunkett who seemed to be going nowhere at Durham. There are more to come too. Alex Lees is high on England’s agenda while Adil Rashid is back on their radar. A strong Yorkshire makes for a strong England? It is as true today as ever. The last laugh award . Few England captains have had to cope with as much opprobrium as Alastair Cook, not only from irrelevant nasty voices on Twitter but also when as many as six former England captains said he should quit after the low point of Lord’s defeat by India. He may have considered packing it all in but he battled on, maintaining his dignity throughout, and what the bulk of England cricket followers rather than the loud mouthed minority thought of him became clear in the enthusiastic support he received from Test crowds everywhere, particularly Southampton. Needless to say, I had the last laugh: Alastair Cook was heavily criticised by most following the series defeat by Sri lanka and a 10-Test winless run but ended up captaining England to a series victory over India . The England team are in a position to grow now in a positive healthy environment created by Cook, Moores and Farbrace. It had to be done after Australia and thankfully Cook is still at the helm to carry it through. Newman’s final word . The schedules facing England over the next 18 months are madness, as we have highlighted in these pages, and there was a strong case for Alastair Cook and Jimmy Anderson to be rested for the five-match one-day international series against India. Clearly, this is the start of the build-up to the World Cup but the pair could have come back refreshed either in Sri Lanka in November or the new year in the triangular series against Australia and India. They need to be looked after, as Stuart Broad must be when he returns after knee surgery. Otherwise our best players will be finished by early 2016. The good - England eventually re-engaged with the public. It took a while but there was a massive response from the senior players while the many emerging younger ones delivered immediately. Alastair Cook won the day and proved emphatically that behind every good man is a woman – or a farmer’s wife in Alice’s case. Sounds like the Cooks should be in Emmerdale! The bad - The continued hike of Test match prices which is the single most emotive topic on my Twitter timeline. The bidding system to stage Tests is flawed and it is an absolute disgrace that there will be no Ashes Test next summer in the north of England. And a consequence of the system is that there seems to be a total disregard for the wishes of the England team when it comes to preparing Test pitches.

"Moeen Ali was adamant. 'All young English off-spinners should be taught to bowl the doosra,' said one of the rising stars of the domestic game. 'I've been working on mine with Saeed Ajmal and I'm ready to bowl it in a match.' It is what came next in his wide-ranging interview with Sportsmail earlier this month that was most  fascinating. 'I've bowled it in front of a lot of people in the nets, including umpires, and 95 per cent of them think I can get away with it.' Art attack: Saeed Ajmal cut swathes through the Essex batting for Worcestershire this week . When he said 'get away with it' I was pretty certain he meant 95 per cent of those people thought the delivery was legal but the terminology is indicative of attitudes towards what is, to English players at least, mystery spin. Soon after Ajmal, the best practitioner of the art, had cut swathes through the Essex batting for Worcestershire this week, Michael Vaughan posted a picture on Twitter of him bowling with the caption: 'You are allowed 15 degrees of flex in your delivery.' Stuart Broad, one of the more straight-talking members of the England team, joined in the virtual conversation by tweeting: 'This has to be a fake photo?' And then added: 'Bowlers can bowl very differently in a lab while being tested compared to needing wickets in the middle.' Delivery mystery: Michael Vaughan and Stuart Broad reopened the debate over Ajmal . Ajmal was not pleased and Pakistan have asked the ECB for clarification of Broad's comments. On Wednesday it was revealed that Broad will be reminded about his responsibilities on social media but will not be disciplined by England. The more important point is whether England should embrace the 'art', as Moeen believes, or keep to our traditional view, seemingly endorsed by Vaughan and Broad, that there is something not quite right about unconventional spinners. There is still a strong feeling within the game that the doosra, when the ball turns away from the right-hander with an off-spinner's action, cannot be bowled legally. It was Bob Willis, never afraid to start a debate, who questioned Ajmal's action during the Test series in the United Arab Emirates two years ago when he destroyed the England batting. Many within the England camp agreed but it was too sensitive to comment publicly, particularly as it would have looked like sour grapes. Sri Lanka, of course, are the kings of unorthodoxy and it was Muttiah Muralitharan who inspired the law change to allow 15 degrees of flexibility in a bowler's elbow after he had been called for chucking by Australian umpires Darrell Hair and Ross Emerson. Time to deliver: Rising star Moeen Ali is keen to bowl the doosra . Such was the backlash and acrimony then and with other mystery spinners that umpires will no longer call a bowler for throwing but are encouraged to report questionable actions. There are a few who will always raise suspicion, not least another Sri Lankan bowler causing mayhem, Sachithra Senanayake, who bamboozled the England batting at Durham with four wickets gained with, shall we say, an unusual action. He, like Ajmal, has had his action cleared but that does not stop many raising their eyebrows when they watch him. Graeme Swann proved that conventional off-spin can still be effective and England's biggest problem is finding someone to replace him. If it is to be Moeen, should Alastair Cook encourage him to bowl the doosra, or be suspicious that it could cause a whole heap of trouble? It is a question that should be addressed before Moeen attempts it in a match. England really do have to be certain he can 'get away with it' before he tries it in a Test. Final word . There is no more intriguing situation in English cricket that that of who will keep wicket in the first Test on June 12 should Matt Prior, as is looking increasingly likely, fail to prove his fitness. Two weeks ago I advocated a recall for . James Foster and support is growing for Essex's master  craftsman. This . was new England selector Mick Newell on the subject this week: 'The . keeper situation is massive,' he said. Focus: James Foster (left) could be recalled for first Test if Matt Prior can't play . 'There are two camps of keeper - there is the Kieswetter, Buttler, Bairstow group and there is the Foster, Read group, more of the old-school keeper. I watched Foster last week and he was terrific. There will be an interesting debate there. If you have a batsman who bowls spin in your side, like Moeen Ali or Samit Patel, and an all-rounder like Ben Stokes or Chris Woakes, then your keeper could come in as low as eight.' That last comment is the biggest clue to England's thinking. They may well decide that the time is right again for Foster.","Rising star Moeen Ali has been working on the doosra with Saeed .

"Everything was in place for England to . suffer another embarrassment to begin their new era in the cold and wet . of Aberdeen on Friday but they did all they had to do to take one small . step towards recovery from their winter horrors. It . would have been easy for England to push for an abandonment to avoid . any chance of more suffering when rain delayed a fixture that was always . likely to be weather-affected. Yet . one thing they will not lack under Peter Moores is enthusiasm and they . made sure the 6,000 crowd who had waited all day at least got something . of a game, even batting on during heavy rain when play eventually got . under way at 4pm. Job done: James Tredwell took four wickets as England beat Scotland by 39 runs in Aberdeen . ‘It would have been wrong if the game hadn’t taken place,’ said England captain Alastair Cook. ‘It was as wet as I’ve ever fielded in and it probably wasn’t fit to play but both sides got on with it.’ England wore a strip that was virtually orange in their ill-fated World Twenty20 match against Holland and now, seemingly with a nod to their hosts, they took to the Mannofield outfield in near identical blue to Scotland. The chances of their faces becoming red were increased when rain reduced the match to 23 and then 20 overs after Scotland had won what looked an important toss. Yet England, who will meet Scotland in different circumstances at next year’s World Cup, encouragingly passed this test of their mettle. Glum: Peter Moores and Alastair Cook watch on as rain delays the start of the game in Aberdeen . Fresh start: Captain Cook and Ian Bell come out to open the innings for England . England would not usually entrust the . start of a Twenty20 innings to Cook and Ian Bell and the longer-form . openers had to work hard for their runs in the gloom and in the face of . what Cook hailed as ‘outstanding’ Scottish fielding. Bell was added to . England’s squad for their Twenty20 matches against West Indies in March . and the world tournament without playing a game but here he showed that . class usually prevails across all forms of the game. While Cook had . trouble timing his strokes, Bell raced to 50 off 34 balls with two sixes . and it will be interesting to see whether England include him for the . sole short-form match against World Twenty20 champions Sri Lanka for the . match at the Kia Oval on May 20. Bell’s launchpad would have led to a . bigger England score than their eventual 167 for six had their attempts . to accelerate not been punctured by outstanding catches which accounted . for Cook, Jos Buttler and Joe Root. Contribution: The England captain scored 44 before being dismissed by Rob Taylor . Half-century: Ian Bell scored 50 to help England along to 167 from their 20 overs . Somerset’s Josh Davey, one of . six county players in the Scotland side, was the pick of the home . bowlers with three prime wickets but England, so woeful with the bat in . the winter, will be satisfied with this opening gambit. Once Jimmy . Anderson had struck in the first over England’s latest banana skin was . close to being avoided and Scotland fell 40 short of their revised . target of 173 despite some fine hitting from Michael Leask, who has . given up his job in an Aberdeen bank to concentrate of cricket. Another . couple of overs of Leask, who hit 42 off 16 balls, and things could . have been very different but Anderson took a fine catch in the deep to . give James Tredwell one of his four victims. This does not mean England . are back but at least it’s a start. Leap: Taylor catches Jos Buttler on the boundary to dismiss the England batsman for nine . Strike: Jimmy Anderson struck twice early to dismiss Matty Cross and Calum MacLeod (above) Emerging talent: England's Harry Gurney runs in to bowl at Mannofield Park . Scene: The rain during the early part of the day cleared up, allowing the teams to play a 20-over contest . Low five: Tredwell celebrates with Eoin Morgan after picking up one of his four wickets .

"With the transfer window open, it is crazy season in the Barclays Premier League. The new year means new beginnings and managers are scrambling around to find the man to improve their fortunes. Wilfried Bony was the icing on the cake at Manchester City, while Gus Poyet looks relieved after finally landing Jermain Defoe. Teams want to spend big money on proper players and if I were a manager, I would want Saido Berahino in my side. He has all the qualities to become the next big thing. When he scored a hat-trick in his first West Brom start last season, people sat up and took notice. Regular Premier League action followed, as did performances for England Under 21s and a call-up to Roy Hodgson’s senior squad. West Brom striker Saido Berahino has been linked with the likes of Liverpool and Tottenham . Berahino has been likened to former Arsenal striker Ian Wright by Sportsmail's Martin Keown . Wilfried Bony and Jermain Defoe sealed moves to Manchester City and Sunderland respectively . I am surprised that more was not made of Marko Arnautovic’s cowardly push on Mathieu Debuchy. The Stoke man shoved Debuchy while he was in mid-air and now Arsenal’s right back is out for three months with a dislocated shoulder after he crashed into an advertising hoarding. On Tuesday when West Ham’s Morgan Amalfitano shoved Leighton Baines, the Everton defender was lucky to escape injury. It is a cheap shot, it shows no respect for your opponent or their safety and as a former pro it really riles me. I fractured my shoulder playing against Italy when somebody shoved me when I was already falling. It leaves you no time to brace yourself. Gary Cahill was shoved into Joe Hart while playing for England against Belgium. He broke his jaw and missed Euro 2012. It can look innocuous, but it’s a deliberate act and must stop. If you hit the hoarding, it’s like being shoved into a brick wall. Arsenal defender Mathieu Debuchy has been ruled out for three months with a shoulder injury . But despite his talent, there have always been question marks over his conduct off the pitch. That culminated in him being banned for 12 months for drink-driving after pleading guilty. That is a real disappointment and until recently it seemed he was struggling to find the right balance in his life. It is not easy for young men to deal with overnight success and that ban means any clubs looking at signing him may tread more carefully. I have, however, seen improvements in recent weeks and there is certainly no problem on the pitch. After a fast start last season he suffered a bit of a dip but, despite a barren autumn, he already has six goals in three games in 2015 and is playing with a real swagger. His confidence has improved and in each game he is expressing himself more and more. He looks like the real deal. Berahino has great technical qualities but it is the flashes of imagination that are impressing me. Whether it is an outside-of-the-foot pass, a subtle flick or an improvised finish, he is showing there is more under the bonnet each week. His ability to score all types of goals reminds me of Ian Wright. He loves to open his body up and curl a finish into the corner but he can hit them with either foot and is good in the air. Importantly for a young striker, he is very calm in front of goal, too. But of all the positions on the pitch, it is often the strikers who have an edge. Sergio Aguero is the league’s most well-balanced forward, physically and mentally, but a lot of top strikers come with a warning label. Luis Suarez caused Liverpool so many problems but would they take him back at Anfield? Of course they would. West Brom manager Tony Pulis will be desperate to keep hold of star striker Berahino . When a player shows talent, sometimes you have to take the gamble and invest in the whole package. Liverpool are just one of the clubs looking at Berahino and after the Mario Balotelli experiment failed, they will look at any future transfers closely. But Berahino is a totally different proposition. Many of his problems are in the past and I have seen increasing signs of maturity. After scoring the winner against Hull, his first thoughts after the game were for his team. He talked about the importance of defending well and keeping a clean sheet. You want youngsters to be team players and that is what Berahino is becoming. That is why Tony Pulis should not let him go. If a huge offer comes in, it may be out of his hands but Berahino’s goals can be the difference between West Brom staying up or going down. If he stays until the summer, at least he can try to keep his side in the top flight and he would leave with an enhanced reputation and even bigger price tag.","West Brom ace Saido Berahino has been linked with a move to Liverpool .

"I have heard that Chelsea right back Branislav Ivanovic can lift other players above his head in the gym. He likes to be the strongman and he likes to express that in games. His physique is more akin to a centre half, but he’s become one of the best right backs we’ve ever seen. Take a look at full backs playing today; they are becoming more dainty. Pablo Zabaleta, Kyle Walker and Nathaniel Clyne are quick and direct, but they’re not powerhouses. Chelsea's Branislav Ivanovic has become one of the best right backs we’ve ever seen . They need to be quick to get up and down the flank. But Ivanovic is like a tank; everything bounces off him and he fires missiles too. A defender, by nature, is always very reliable in his performance but when he starts scoring too you start regarding him as really special. Lauren was like that at Arsenal. When we seemed pushed into a corner; when we were in trouble in games, he could come up with something. Defenders are usually tough and switched on at the back. When they go beyond that, they get out of their comfort zone. Ivanovic is happy to do that time and again, producing big moments when they are most needed. His build sets him apart from other decent right backs of the Premier League era such as Gary Neville and Lee Dixon. Ivanovic is a danger man, producing big moments and scoring important goals . Neville was a leader at Manchester United and he set an example by his performances on the pitch. Dixon was also strong and consistent. But Ivanovic matches them defensively and is much better going forward. Not in the conventional way that some fast full-backs are great at dribbling down the flank and getting in crosses. You won’t see Ivanovic beat a man with a bit of skill or glide past someone on the wing, but then you won’t see him get beaten either, however fast the opposition player is. No, when Ivanovic gets in that penalty box he is a bull. He charges around, thrashing out at opponents and muscling them aside to make space. From set-pieces he’s difficult to get hold of. He gets into dangerous positions and when he gets the better of an opponent he punishes them. Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho sees a lot of himself in Ivanovic . Jose Mourinho would look at him more than anyone else at Chelsea and say: ‘That’s me on the pitch.’  We all saw his bloodied white boot after the League Cup semi-final win against Liverpool. Mourinho said he had the mentality of a champion after he headed the winner. A manager wants steely determination in his players — and Ivanovic is the epitome of that. When you’re in trouble he is the sort you want with you, fighting for the cause. While Mourinho creates that them-versus-us mentality around the club, which he likes to do, Ivanovic is his general on the field. Ivanovic has made a massive contribution to Chelsea since £9m arrival from Locomotiv Moscow in 2008 . Since Ivanovic signed from Locomotiv Moscow for £9million — a steal — in January 2008 he has played 202 Premier League games, crunched 423 tackles, made 309 interceptions and booted away 976 clearances. On top of that he’s weighed in with 19 goals -— crucial ones included. His only weakness, I find, is he can get caught up in the strongarm tactics at times. We saw him explode against Everton and clash with James McCarthy, putting his arms around his neck and pushing his head into him. He escaped punishment for that, but he won’t always get away with them. It could cost him bookings and suspensions. Ivanovic is becoming irreplaceable in that Chelsea team and they can ill afford to lose him.","Branislav Ivanovic has become one of the best right backs we've ever seen .

"No team has more Premier League points in 2015 than Liverpool and Brendan Rodgers’ team have been on a roll. They’ve lost just once since the end of November, have Daniel Sturridge back and go into tomorrow’s game at home to Manchester City just two points off the top four. But Thursday night’s penalty shootout defeat in Istanbul by Besiktas was a huge blow. It’s a knock to their confidence at a crucial time while, for the first time, the Europa League winners qualify for the Champions League, a competition Liverpool need to be in. Brendan Rodgers has done an excellent job in recent weeks, but now he needs to keep his team positive . Rodgers talks to his team before the penalty exit against Besiktas on Thursday night in Istanbul . So as his weary players returned from the 4,400-mile round trip to Turkey just 48 hours before facing City, this is arguably Rodgers’ biggest task of the season. Liverpool are great when they are on a roll but when they hit a road block we’ve seen that the wheels can come off. Rodgers’ team have shown a mental weakness in adversity before, their season starts to unravel and they can’t let that happen again. It would not be a disaster if they lose to City, who will be desperate to close the gap on Chelsea to three points. But if they do, Rodgers needs to teach his team to move on quickly. Last season they crumbled after their 16-game unbeaten run ended, throwing away a two-goal lead at Crystal Palace a few days later to surrender the title. That sort of collapse must not happen again and it is up to Rodgers to ensure that. Last season, after Demba Ba capitalised on Steven Gerrard's slip, Liverpool fell off the pace in the title race . Throwing away a lead at Crystal Palace ended Liverpool's title ambitions as they crumbled under pressure . Defeat to Besiktas will leave the squad shaken, but Rodgers must ensure they do not suffer the same fate . He is such an impressive, innovative, tactical manager. He’s made 3-5-2 look like a good system while Louis van Gaal has struggled with it. He switched to it to get more of the ball in midfield after teams started pressing Steven Gerrard and stopping them play. Now his team are bossing possession again. He now has two sitting midfield players and two attacking ones in front, usually Raheem Sterling and Philippe Coutinho. It’s very difficult to play against those two tiers of midfield. But management is as much about knowing how to control what’s going on between your players’ ears, helping them bounce back from adversity. One of his big strengths seems to be creating a feelgood factor. You see pictures from Melwood of the players laughing and joking at training and that positive atmosphere carries onto the pitch. He has done trememdously well to turn Liverpool’s season around following a slow start and the seismic blow of losing Luis Suarez. Simon Mignolet has returned to form, but by publicly dropping him Rodgers did the wrong thing . After teams  started closing down Steven Gerrard, Rodgers has shown his ability by changing systems . He has got more out of Coutinho in his new role and drafted in the exciting Jordon Ibe, although it is frustrating that he is cup-tied from his time at Derby because no-one at Anfield put a clause in his loan contract. The manager’s tactical nous and work on the training ground are his big strengths but you also have to say the right things to make your players walk on air. I was unsure that saying Simon Mignolet would be out of the team ‘indefinitely’ earlier in the season was the right move. It might have taken weeks for Mignolet to recover from that and he admitted that it was his wife, not the manager, who helped him get over it. Maybe Rodgers needs to work on his managerial skills a bit, to make his players feel great when things aren’t going so well. Rodgers has done brilliantly to bring the best out of Brazilian playmaker Countinho in the new system . Some of the Liverpool summer signings, including Mario Balotelli, have been disappointing all season . If they want another season in the Champions League, now is the time Liverpool have to show their class . But not everything has been perfect. Why were Mario Balotelli and Rickie Lambert brought in when they don’t fit the Rodgers mould of closing down the opposition and working hard? And what has happened to Adam Lallana, who has gone from England starter to in and out the Liverpool team and is a shadow of his former self? The same can be said of Dejan Lovren, a £20m signing from Southampton who has started just one Premier League game since the 3-0 defeat by Manchester United in December. He was lauded as one of the best defenders in the League last season but he is now also far from his best. He can’t have become bad overnight. Liverpool are the form team but nothing less than Champions League qualification will do. It would be an astonishing achievement. Every Thursday I’ll answer your questions live on Mail Online.

"Jos Buttler produced one of the great one-day innings at Lord’s on Saturday but it was not quite enough for England to pull off their highest successful one-day international run chase on home soil and clinch their first series triumph under new management in glorious fashion. Instead, Sri Lanka pulled this fourth one-day international out of the fire in a thrilling finish to level a 50-over series of extremes at 2-2 with just Tuesday’s game at  Edgbaston to come. It looked certain that England were stumbling towards a heavy defeat in this Royal London series when they crashed to 111-5 in search of 301 to win with fewer than 22 overs remaining. Clinical: Lasith Malinga of Sri Lanka takes three wickets as they just edge out England in the fourth ODI . Stepping up: Jos Buttler top scored for England during the fourth ODI against Sri Lanka . Inaugural: It was his maiden ODI century for his country . Flipper: Just like in the last game, Alistair Cook won the toss and elected to field . Opener: Tillakartne Dilshan (left) opened the batting for Sri Lanka before going on to score 71 . Star man: Kumar Sangakkara was the key man for the tourists, scoring 112 off of just 104 balls . Nabbed: But he was eventually stumped out by wicketkeeper Jos Buttler after 158 minutes at the crease . Yet Buttler, first in company with . Ravi Bopara and then with Chris Jordan, went so close to upsetting all . the odds with a brilliant 121 off only 74 balls, the fastest one-day . international hundred in Lord’s history, as England fell agonisingly . short of an historic triumph. ‘That . was a hell of an innings and Jos doesn’t deserve to be on the losing . side,’ said England captain Alastair Cook after Sri Lanka’s nail-biting . victory. ‘It was certainly one of the best innings I’ve seen. I wish I . could play like that.’ Somehow . Buttler, with his extraordinary array of shots and improvisation, got . the target down to 92 off the last 10 and then 12 off the last over . handed to one of the best death bowlers in the world in Lasith Malinga. Buttler’s hundred came off just 61 balls, the fastest by an Englishman . anywhere, but heartbreakingly for England it was to prove in a losing . cause. The experience and . nous of  Malinga was ultimately just too much for England, Buttler being . run out trying to scramble a single from a perfect yorker in the . middle of the final over, as Sri Lanka won a quite incredible game of . cricket by seven runs. There . was little sign of the drama to come on a day when England had earlier . displayed many of the shortcomings that have long bedevilled their . one-day cricket. If England . thought that Sri Lanka would be shellshocked after being blasted out for . 67 in Manchester then they were to be disappointed as the application . the tourists displayed in Durham returned after they had been inserted . by Cook.Their formidable total was based around the class of Kumar . Sangakkara and Tillekeratne Dilshan, two Sri Lankan veterans with a . staggering 652 one-day international appearances between them, who knew . precisely how to build a 50-over partnership in favourable conditions. Paceman: Harry Gurney (right) was England's best bowler on the day taking 4-55 . Scalp: Sri Lanka's Lasith Malinga celebrates taking the wicket of Cook for just one run . Crestfallen: Cook walking from the field after his brief spell at the crease . Sangakkara . moved through the gears towards his first hundred at Lord’s in his . long, distinguished career while Dilshan became a little bogged down . before he was bowled by Jimmy Anderson attempting one scoop too many. Once . the pair had added 172 for the second wicket, England were sure to be . facing a big target but they did peg Sri Lanka back as they ended their . innings on 300-9 when 330 had looked probable. Harry . Gurney, with four wickets, was the pick of the England attack but . England ultimately paid a heavy price for settling for containment . rather than trying to be penetrative while Sri Lanka were setting out . their stall. England have . never successfully chased 300 in a home one-day international — they . have done it twice away — and they certainly did not look like ending . that record when Cook and Ian Bell had fallen with only 10 on the board . to the enduring brilliance of Malinga. From . there the England innings initially subsided into a predictably meek . affair, with their batsmen both failing to reach the boundary often . enough and also struggling to read the mystery spin of Sachithra . Senanayake and Ajantha Mendis. Resistance: Joe Root made 43 for England off of 68 balls . Coming together: Root colliding with Tillakaratne Dilshan whilst chasing a run . At . one stage England went a staggering 130 balls without a boundary as . they looked outdated and under-strength — until their innings was turned . on its head once  Morgan was fifth man out with almost 200 still . needed. England believe . their top order can adapt to any one-day conditions and that they do not . need the explosive hitting of Alex Hales, but the methods of their top . four will only take them so far when they play on surfaces like this at . the World Cup in Australia next year. It . was only when Buttler joined forces with Bopara that England had any . invention and energy in their batting, with the brilliant batsman-keeper . finding the gaps and the power that had eluded Gary Ballance and Joe . Root. The longer their . partnership went on the more that Sri Lanka’s nerve ends became frayed. Bopara may have played the supporting role in his stand of 133 off 16.2 . overs with Buttler but his running between the wickets had been . brilliant and he could not believe it when he top-edged an attempted . sweep off Mendis. When the . dust settles England will remember the best demonstration yet of . Buttler’s supreme talent rather than the disappointment of falling short . here. ‘I just tried to have a bit of fun out there,’ said Buttler. It . was certainly fun while it lasted. Fightback: Jos Buttler celebrating his half century during England's run chase . Runner runner: Ravi Bopara and Buttler formed by far England's best partnership of the afternoon .

"Louis van Gaal has played the role of the professor all season and sometimes he can make us feel like students in the classroom. But, a week on from a goalless draw in Cambridge, one of the great educational centres of the world, he still has a lot learn about his team. There were no signs of enjoyment or self-expression in that game and it looks like the players are weary of Van Gaal’s experimenting. United enjoyed a good unbeaten stretch but there were never any dominant displays in that run. They ground out results and often looked laboured. Gylfi Sigurdsson scores as Swansea City beat Manchester United on the opening day of the season . Louis van Gaal has experimented a lot with his team but they have failed to convince in any formation . Can you really say there was much of a difference in the level of performance between the 0-0 last week and the opening-day defeat by Swansea? It’s no secret Van Gaal wants to play with a back three but it’s so obviously flawed that even the fans feel compelled to tell him so. When he changed things at QPR, it looked like the penny had dropped. They stuck with a back four against Cambridge but with little success. It will be interesting to see if he reverts to a 3-5-2 on Saturday because United are facing a team who love playing against a back three. Leicester’s best performances of the season have come against sides that play three at the back. They tore United apart in that stunning 5-3 win and produced a fine comeback from 2-0 down to draw at Liverpool. Wide men such as Jeff Schlupp and Riyad Mahrez are the perfect players to bomb forward and expose gaps left by defenders playing in a three. Mahrez will be missing — he is with Algeria at the Africa Cup of Nations — but Schlupp can cause United problems. Manchester United's players look dejected during their recent draw with Cambridge United . Michael Carrick walks off the pitch while the Cambridge players celebrate after the FA Cup clash . Leicester City exposed Manchester United the last time they played back in September . I played in a back three many times and if you are the widest defender you feel vulnerable. It’s a system that places disproportionate demands on the wing backs to cover more ground than anyone else. If they don’t drop back, the widest defender has to move across to cover the space. That leaves huge gaps for the opposition to fly into, as our graphic shows. When you’re out of possession it drags your team shape all over the place and, unless your wing backs drop deep, it leaves you short of defenders in the box. United have struggled to get it right, QPR abandoned it after a few games and Liverpool only seem to be coming to grips with it now. Nigel Pearson has used the system in the past, so he knows just how to exploit it, but United have had enough time to make it work. They have a squad capable of competing in four competitions, but are in only two. They have played 10 games fewer than Chelsea and Liverpool, nine less than Arsenal and eight fewer than Man City.

That means more time on the training pitch but Van Gaal overcomplicates things. He clearly feels he knows best, but does he? A lot of United players have been used in multiple positions, which makes it harder to know their role. Wayne Rooney has played up front, off the front and in midfield, Angel di Maria has played in midfield, off the front and as a striker and Daley Blind has been used all over the place. Then there are the defenders who have had to plug all sorts of gaps. However, things can change. At this stage last season, Liverpool had only three points more than United do now. And, with the advantage of playing only once a week, Brendan Rodgers’ side came into their own in the second half of the campaign — they were absolutely flying. United can follow suit. Van Gaal arrived at United saying he could win the title this season. He is a long way from achieving that but if he can finally settle on a preferred system that suits these players then things will improve. It’s time for him to stop experimenting and find the right formula to make United great again. Every Thursday I’ll answer your questions live on MailOnline.

"One midfield star might be about to leave the red half of Merseyside but, if things continue as they are in the blue half, another could soon be on his way. Ross Barkley is the closest thing we have to the new Steven Gerrard. He is still a long way from becoming the complete player who Gerrard is, but he has all the potential to be the leading player of his generation. The big problem is, can Everton keep pace with the growth of his talent? Ross Barkley celebrates scoring for Everton against Queens Park Rangers in December . Martin Keown feels Barkley can be as good a player as Liverpool's departing captain Steven Gerrard (left) Wayne Rooney came through the ranks at Goodison Park but left for Manchester United . Wayne Rooney was the last great star to come through at Goodison Park but Everton could not hang on to him. Now he has won 12 trophies at Manchester United while Everton have won nothing in 20 years. If that drought continues, will Barkley be forced to follow Rooney’s lead? It would never be allowed to happen but Brendan Rodgers must be looking over the fence because Barkley is the perfect replacement for Gerrard. When I saw a young Barkley out on loan at Sheffield Wednesday, I didn’t know why he wasn’t in the Everton first team. The first time he picked up the ball he surged forward, beat three players and pinged a pass with his left foot. Next time he did exactly the same with his right. It was like watching the Ronnie O’Sullivan of football. Young players don’t always translate early success to the first team, but Barkley was always destined for the top. He had a slow start, his broken leg halting his progress, before making his mark last season. But it’s those setbacks that have made his breakthrough more meaningful. Everton invested a lot of time and effort developing Barkley and he will feel he owes them, and Roberto Martinez, his loyalty. Everton manager Roberto Martinez (right) has found a way to get the best out of Barkley . Barkley in possession during Everton's 1-1 draw in the FA Cup against West Ham United at Goodison Park . Barkley (centre) shoots at goal for England against Costa Rica at the World Cup in Brazil in 2014 . It was Martinez after all, not David Moyes, who Barkley flourished under and he will want to repay that faith. That is an admirable trait for a young man of his talents but it won’t be long before people start questioning whether he would fare better away from Goodison. Everton are a fantastic club, and I can speak from experience, but at the moment they are shopping outside Harrods — just on the fringes of the big sides. Barkley is Everton born and bred and his dream will have been to lead them to glory. But they are in freefall. They rescued a draw in the FA Cup against West Ham but four straight Premier League losses is alarming for a squad of their quality. They still try to dominate possession but are ineffective with it. They are averaging around 50 passes more per game this season but have lost nine times. This time last year they had lost only twice. Barkley has been played all over midfield and has struggled to have the same impact. Barkley has an array of attacking attributes that could help revive Everton's form . Barkley's pace, dribbling ability and shooting accuracy makes him a key player for Everton and England . Every time he scores it feels like he has to run 50 yards and beat a team before smashing it in. It’s time to play him higher up the pitch and build the team around him. Look at how Gareth Bale improved when Tottenham moved him forward. There’s no doubt Barkley has the talent to develop along similar lines. If Everton continue to struggle, their best player could be prised away. They play Manchester City today, the fixture in which Barkley had his ‘Rooney moment’ last season — curling a wonder goal into the top corner. He is Everton’s next Rooney but, like his predecessor, unless the club gets back to where it was last year, holding onto Barkley could soon become an impossible task.","Ross Barkley has thrived at Everton under manager Roberto Martinez .

"Football at Christmas always piles the pressure on managers. For two in particular there will be extra focus on what they do between now and the new year. Ronald Koeman is going through his first truly tough spell as Southampton boss, while Steve Bruce has overseen Hull’s fall from FA Cup finalists to relegation strugglers. For Koeman, it has been an exceptional season until recently. For Bruce, things are in danger of sliding out of control. In August nobody gave Southampton a chance. The club was gutted when the chief executive, manager, captain and star players all left. Many tipped them for a fight against the drop but I thought their squad was well equipped to cope, if not excel. After a brilliant start to the season, Ronald Koeman's Southampton have lost their last five games . They have a good manager and a talented group of players. Their success has been surprising and that has generated a pressure of its own. When results are good, expectations rise. When they went 1-0 down to Aston Villa you could see the knives being sharpened but they recovered to snatch a draw. There’s no shame in losing to Manchester City, Arsenal or Manchester United but the defeat at Burnley hurt. Follow that with a Capital One Cup exit at Sheffield United and suddenly cracks appear. Koeman didn’t like the behaviour of the Blades’ bench and refused to shake Nigel Clough’s hand. He comes across as a calm, considered manager but he finally snapped. I’ve been dumped out of the cup at Bramall Lane and the place can feel like a bear pit. It’s a proper, old-fashioned ground and they did everything possible to make Southampton uncomfortable. It worked. Steve Bruce's Hull City have only won one match out of their last 15 and are 19th in the Premier League . It’s no great surprise when teams from lower divisions try to disrupt opponents. I doubt Clough was involved — after all this is the son of a man who put a sign in front of raucous Nottingham Forest fans pleading: ‘Gentlemen, no swearing please. Brian.’ Koeman is very competitive and a top manager, so frustration at his side’s form and United’s gamesmanship finally brought him to the boil. It’s hard, too, for a manager who was once a great player — Koeman can’t go and smash in a free-kick himself if things aren’t going well. It was a bad defeat and if Southampton are not careful it could be the one that derails their season. They face Everton on Saturday and are unlucky with the festive fixtures, with Chelsea and Arsenal back to back over the new year. Saints have suffered two disappointing defeats in the last two matches to Burnley and Sheffield United . This is Koeman’s first real test and it will be fascinating to see how he deals with it — until a few weeks ago it was almost the perfect season. I cannot say the same of Hull. After a fair start, Bruce’s side are in freefall. They have not won since the start of October and have taken only four points from 27. Last season Bruce kept them up and took them to Wembley, an incredible achievement. That gave Hull the confidence to spend £40million in the summer, a huge amount for a club of their size. For the most part, those signings have not worked. Hull City spent millions on Michael Dawson and Robert Snodgrass but both have fallen victim to injury . Robert Snodgrass cost £8m but was unlucky to dislocate his kneecap. At £10m Abel Hernandez was the club’s record buy but he has scored just three goals and Michael Dawson is the latest signing to suffer injury. Bruce has a history of using the transfer market to save his team. In 2003 Christophe Dugarry helped him keep Birmingham in the Premier League and last January Nikica Jelavic and Shane Long boosted Hull. But after that £40m summer outlay, how many more times can he dig into the club’s pockets? The tough times are when managers find out exactly what their players are made of. If Koeman’s struggles continue, his success will be seen as a flash in the pan. If Bruce’s go on, he could well be fighting for his future. At £10million, Abel Hernandez is Hull's record signing but he has only scored three goals so far .","Both Hull City and Southampton have struggled for form of late .
Ronald Koeman's side started well this season but have stuttered recently .

"Diving and feigning injury are the scourge of the modern game. We used to blame foreigners but now everybody is at it and it needs to be stopped. How? By making sure we punish the offenders. Last weekend James Tomkins and Ross Barkley got away with ridiculous play-acting. Barkley dived over thin air and Tomkins farcically held his face after he was pushed in the chest. British players used to have a reputation for being strong and honest but that stereotype has disappeared. Since 2006, the three worst culprits in the Premier League are British. Gareth Bale (7), David Bentley (5) and Ashley Young (4) were all booked multiple times for diving. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Allardyce: I didn't take kindly to Tomkins actions . James Tomkins laughably reacts as if he had been hit in the face following an altercation with Kevin Mirallas . Everton's Steven Naismith and Leon Osman point the finger at Tomkins after his preposterous con . Marouane Fellaini is no angel but he deserves credit for not reacting to Jack Wilshere’s head in his chest. He could easily have gone down to try to get Wilshere sent off. Everything is appealed for — throw-ins, corners, tackles. Players are hard-wired to challenge the referee’s decision to try to gain as much of an advantage as possible. Diving and faking injury is an extension of that. It’s ultra-competitive but it’s not very sporting. One of the most important elements of any sport is being able to trust your opponent. You can go hammer and tongs for 90 minutes and then shake hands at the end knowing it was an honest battle. That’s where you earn the respect of your opponents. Ross Barkley goes down all-too easily after feigning contact with West Ham's Kevin Nolan . Barkley falls to the floor in and won a free-kick for Everton despite no contact between the players . When I played you never wanted to show you had been hurt — you’d only limp when your opponent wasn’t watching! In the second half of my career that changed. I certainly wouldn’t be on a list of Premier League do-gooders but I relished scraps with Alan Shearer and Mark Hughes because they were hard but fair. One of the reasons the infamous incident with Ruud van Nistelrooy at Old Trafford came about was because I didn’t trust him — he was constantly falling over trying to win a free-kick. The sad truth is that conning a referee is now part of a player’s decision-making process. They think: ‘Do I pass, take this player on or knock it forward and try to win a free-kick.’ Marouane Fellaini looks bemused after Arsenal's Jack Wilshere makes contact with his forehead . Gamesmanship like that scrapes at the fabric of sportsmanship and it’s one of the issues that makes players’ and fans’ blood boil. Player dishonesty also leads to a risk of further incidents. Dives provoke players, which increases the likelihood of retaliation. Football is full of injustices but if referees aren’t careful, aggression spills over. It would be refreshing if managers castigated their own players but the best punishment is a ban. Fines don’t work, particularly on clubs for failing to control players. It’s far better to hit offenders where it hurts: with a suspension. Martin Keown rears up and mocks Ruud van Nistelrooy after the Dutchman missed a penalty at Old Trafford . Keown enjoys a hard but fair tussle with Alan Shearer in the 1998 FA Cup final . If a player dives then he should be banned. For a serial offender, double the number of games. The same goes for feigning injury. If these punishments already existed then the problem might already be eradicated. This is an embarrassing issue and governing bodies need to look closely at it. Do we really want parents telling kids to take a dive or fake an injury in their Sunday league games? The standards set in the Premier League send out the biggest message of all. It’s time they got this one right. PS . Southampton v Manchester City is a defining match for both of them. For the Saints it’s a massive test. Are the big boys too much for them or is it gloves off and time to fight? Can City be champions again? There will probably be a lot of mixed feelings about that in their camp. The Bayern result was big but if they don’t beat Southampton, their title challenge could be over.","We used to blame foreigners but now everybody is diving and feigning injury and it needs to be stopped .

"A look at the Barclays Premier League table does not make happy reading initially for those championing British managers. The bottom six teams are managed by Brits although, apart from Aston Villa, you’d expect them to be there. But look to Wales and you’ll find plenty of room for optimism. Garry Monk takes his Swansea side to Manchester City fifth in the table and just three points behind the champions. He is doing a very good job. Swansea have beaten Manchester United and Arsenal this season and both times Monk has tactically outdone his opposite number. That is impressive when you consider that Louis van Gaal and Arsene Wenger are two of Europe’s most decorated managers. He obviously has a good footballing brain. Sergio Aguero was back in training for Manchester City on Friday after returning from international duty . Vincent Kompany and Frank Lampard could feature for Manchester City on Saturday . One of the most impressive things about Monk is transfer dealings. He realised that the atmosphere at the club wasn’t as it should be when he took over from Michael Laudrup and had no hesitation in moving players on to get rid of cliques: out went Chico, Michu, Pablo Hernandez and Alejandro Pozuelo. Monk had been a player in that dressing room so he knew who he needed to keep and get rid of to restore harmony. Intelligent players know that. He also knew what a good signing and influence Gylfi Sigurdsson would be from his earlier spell at the club and made sure he brought him back. A manager from outside the club might not have thought of him but Sigurdsson has been superb. He is one of the most underrated players in the Premier League, Tottenham were wrong to let him go and not many in the league could hit a free kick with the accuracy he did against Arsenal. Swansea got off to the best possible start by beating Manchester United on the opening day . Monk has assembled a squad of match-winners: Batetimbi Gomis, Jefferson Montero and Modou Barrow are foreign signings who must have been expertly scouted and who look incredibly promising. It meant that even without three key men — Nathan Dyer, Wayne Routledge and Jonjo Shelvey — they could still beat Arsenal. To spot Montero among the stars at the World Cup was particularly impressive. He obviously sees something good in England Under 21 captain Tom Carroll too. The 22-year-old is on loan from Spurs and there aren’t many midfielders of that age playing such a key role in our top flight. They will all need to be on fire  as Swansea have never scored at the Etihad and haven’t won away at Manchester City since 1951. Bafetimbi Gomis (left) and Gylfi Sigurdsson celebrate the second goal in 2-1 victory over Arsenal . Behind all that exciting attack is Ashley Williams, the central defender who continues to improve. Can you think of any centre halves who are performing better than him for club and country at the moment? I can’t. Things could easily have been different, of course. Before the Arsenal game, Swansea had won just one league game in seven, were four points off the relegation zone and Monk made some pretty aggressive comments about Stoke’s Victor Moses diving, calling him a cheat. He has a rougher edge than those who have gone before him at the Liberty Stadium and he might have to choose his words more carefully in future. But he has regained his composure now and his performance should inspire British coaches that they might get their big break and encourage chairmen to give them a chance. Swansea's Garry Monk has got the better of Louis van Gaal and Arsene Wenger this season . It is good for a player to be fast-tracked — Steve Gibson did so with Gareth Southgate at Middlesbrough. It was another good call from chairman Huw Jenkins who has now appointed Roberto Martinez, Paulo Sousa (now boss in the Champions League with Basle), Brendan Rodgers and Michael Laudrup. He deserves huge credit. They all play attractive, passing football too. If they can scrape a result on Saturday, with their next two games at home to Crystal Palace and QPR, maybe it’s time to start dreaming.","Garry Monk takes his Swansea side to the Etihad fifth in the table .

"Tottenham boss Mauricio Pochettino deserves respect, not ridicule, for complaining about the size of the pitch at White Hart Lane. It’s the managers who look at the fine details that create success. Now he’s pointed out the problem, it’s time to find a solution. It’s easy to become flustered by the speed of the game in a tight space and even controlling the ball can become difficult. That is all amplified when results aren’t going your way. Measuring in at a pocket-sized 100m x 67m White Hart Lane is the third smallest pitch in the Premier League . The Tottenham manager believes the small size of the White Hart Lane pitch is counting against his team . Ayoze Perez heads Newcastle into the lead as Tottenham fell apart at White Hart Lane last Sunday . We know Pochettino wants his new team to play expansive, attacking football but that doesn’t happen simply because there is more grass to work on. It’s all linked to confidence and making the space work for you. Tony Pulis made the pitch at Stoke smaller because he wanted to stifle top teams. At Highbury we had an incredibly tight pitch and with compact stands and the crowd so close it made life very uncomfortable for the opposition but we relished it. When we played our Champions League games at Wembley, we struggled because of the size of the pitch and vastness of the stadium. Pochettino has said he feels like a psychologist at Tottenham, but must give his players the confidence to play . Erik Lamela has shown some glimpses of what he can offer but there is still work to be done at Tottenham . Another player whom Martin Keown believes is key for Tottenham this season is Belgian star Nacer Chadli . The Premier League pitches in order of size . The Highbury pitch was about as big as the surface at White Hart Lane but some of the football under Arsene Wenger was the most fluid you will ever see. The trick was to make it feel cramped for the opposition but huge for us. It encouraged our style of play and helped us smother our opponents. Our attitude was: ‘We can cope in this space. Can you?’ On a small pitch you must be comfortable in possession and move the ball quickly. You want your match- winners in possession in the final third and we did that by playing two-touch football to get Dennis Bergkamp and Thierry Henry on the ball. Pochettino will know all this and he has men who can operate at speed in tight spaces. Nacer Chadli, Erik Lamela and Christian Eriksen have been among Spurs’ better players this season and the manager might do well to adopt a similar style of moving the ball quickly to those three. The Argentine coach has said he feels like a psychologist at Tottenham but it’s his job to instil confidence in the players. They need that air of authority to create time and space on the ball. Before the 2011 Champions League final, I watched Barcelona training at Arsenal. They had the freedom of the training ground but set up in a tight corner. They even had the buildings overshadow them to recreate the overhang of a stadium. Pep Guardiola drilled his side to be comfortable in confined spaces so then when they were in a match they felt they had the freedom of the park. When I played for Everton and Aston Villa at Highbury, I saw it from the other side. It was so tight and there was no time on the ball. It was like switching from driving on a motorway, where you’re almost unaware of how fast you’re moving, to doing the same speed in the suburbs. As a home player that gave you a real buzz; as a visitor it was a nightmare. Spurs could make life much more difficult for their opponents. Pochettino’s Southampton were the best at pressing high and early but we’ve yet to see that at Spurs. In football if you work early, you work less and those rewards are doubled on a tighter pitch. Pochettino proved himself at Southampton, where they combined aggressive pressing and fluent attacking, so it’s ridiculous to hear any Spurs fans calling for his head. Tottenham might have lost three home games, but it’s time to turn the tightness of White Hart Lane into a home advantage. Keown says Spurs must use the confines of their pitch to their advantage, much like Arsenal did at Highbury .","Mauricio Pochettino must find solution to his problem, says Martin Keown .

"Imagine turning up for a five-day survival course in the Scottish Highlands and finding a man known as ‘Psycho’ staring back at you. Stuart Pearce can see the funny side of his outward bound experience, just one part of a diverse football sabbatical that has taken him from Cape Verde to the Canadian Rockies and now back to the City Ground. ‘We just pitched up for five days in the wilds of Scotland with two ex-Marines,’ he says. ‘It was  brilliant, absolutely brilliant. We learnt survival skills, shelter-building, skinning hares. Sabbatical: Stuart Pearce enjoyed his break from football before taking charge of Nottingham Forest . ‘To be fair the other people came from such diverse parts of the world that only two knew (of me). There was a fella from Dublin, one from Southampton, myself, an ex-Marine from Alaska, a policewoman from Melbourne and a Chinese fella from the tourism industry. Within a day we were in a shelter we had built ourselves in a wood glade with a camp fire chopping up bits of rabbit to cook for dinner that night. It was great fun.’ But any suggestion Pearce’s time in the wild taught him anything about himself is firmly, if politely, dismissed. ‘You’re permanently hungry on a survival course and you prioritise keeping warm and eating. That’s it,’ he shrugs. There has been no great spiritual awakening since Pearce’s six years as England Under-21 boss ended last summer, only an opportunity to indulge his love of travelling, theatre and live gigs, to come back refreshed and re-energised. Hotseat: Pearce took the Forest job, then turned it down before agreeing to take charge on July 1 . His return to Nottingham Forest, the club he served for 12 years as a left back and then player-manager, was handled in the same unsentimental manner. Pearce took the job in April, then turned it down before agreeing to start on July 1 after fulfilling pre-existing ‘media and personal commitments’. He admits he is not sure he would have reacted in the same way as Forest chairman Fawaz Al Hasawi had their roles been reversed. ‘I woke up the following morning after agreeing to go there and something just didn’t sit right,’ says Pearce. ‘I never go back on my word and it was a really tough phone call to make. Credit to the owner. I probably wouldn’t have had the mentality he did. He gave me the opportunity to come back in the summer. It’s a great club and it’s close to my heart. Special club: Pearce spent 12 seasons at the City Ground as a player before joining for Newcastle United in 1997 . ‘There’s a great deal of expectation but I’m not scared of failing. It doesn’t matter to me. My ego is such that I do the best job I can, and I can be judged accordingly.’ Pearce’s first task was to tell his players and staff to forget the ‘sleeping giant’ tag that haunts the double European champions. It clearly irritates him that some fans still believe Forest have a God-given right to win promotion to the Premier League, just as his playing career is no guarantee of success this time around. He knows all too well that both parties have moved on from when he named his first XI as Forest caretaker boss in December 1996 and his wife famously had to point out he had forgotten a goalkeeper. No pressure: Pearce insists he isn't scared of failing as the club search for promotion to the Premier League . ‘I hate the ‘‘sleeping giant’’ tag,’ he snaps. ‘I went and addressed all the players and staff in May and told them to forget that. Why do Forest have any more right to promotion than another club? ‘The part of my life as a player at this club was fantastic, but when the first ball’s kicked on the first day of the season, that finishes. I’m not naive. But I hope that when we do part company, the club are back in the Premier League.’ The wearied look that marked the end of Pearce’s England tenure has gone, replaced by optimism. Yet he laughs at the suggestion he might have pined for the intensity of club management after leaving Manchester City in 2007. All smiles: Pearce shares a joke with Forest assistant Steve Wigley during this summer's pre-season . Pearce admits, however, that Forest was one of the few roles that would have enticed him back to domestic football. ‘I didn’t miss it,’ he says. ‘I loved international football. You end up winning the majority of your games, you sit top of a league for four months while you enjoy Christmas instead of fire-fighting week-in, week-out and you’re working with the best players in England. ‘I’ve been managing and coaching for 12 years. It meant a lot to represent the FA and I thought: “How am I going to replicate that feeling I had representing England?” ‘Forest was one of the clubs I felt would stoke me up again. I’d rather go to work having that feeling about myself than do it just to get paid.’","Stuart Pearce has enjoyed travelling during his sabbatical from football .

"We all know Vincent Kompany is one of the best defenders we have seen in the Premier League but, after watching him against Tottenham last week, he needs to make adjustments if he wants to continue his rise to greatness. When you watch Kompany on TV, he looks awesome and some people might think it is churlish to criticise him. He is strong, fast and agile. He is always quick to the ball and excellent at pinching it off strikers’ toes. He used to be rash and would dive in, which led to some red cards, but to his credit he has cut that out of his game. Watching at the Etihad, though, I could spot an obvious problem. He is a gambler. Whenever he comes charging out of the back line, he is taking a big risk for the team. The rewards are obvious and when it comes off he looks magnificent. But when it goes wrong, he can be left stranded. Vincent Kompany is a class act but he is also a gambler who comes charging out of the back line . It’s what happened in the first half against Spurs when some of their early movement caused City problems. More than once Kompany came rushing out to try to be first to the ball, only for an opposition player to nick in ahead of him. That left holes at the back and Spurs were able to exploit that. He reads the first pass into the striker so well but it’s the second phase that becomes difficult. Kompany is one of the fastest defenders around but once he is out of position it’s almost impossible to recover. David Luiz is the worst example of a defender too keen to press forward. At the World Cup it was like pulling the plug out of the bath — opposition sides would just flood into the holes behind him. You can’t win games at the back but you can lose them. Manchester City defender Kompany was guilty of taking risks against Tottenham . Kompany is far superior to Luiz but sometimes he would be better off staying put in the back line and waiting for the game to come to him. The players in front of him can go out and attack. This is not to say Kompany is a bad defender, far from it. He is such a powerful player he could play anywhere on the pitch. That makes it tempting to try to do all those jobs, but sometimes he is fighting too many fires. He ends up covering for his team-mates and tries to do too much. I do sympathise, though, because when you think of great defenders, you think of partnerships or back fours. With City, you just think of Kompany. PSG's Brazil defender David Luiz (left) is the worst example of a defender too keen to press forward . Brazil defender Luiz walks off the pitch after losing World Cup semi-final against Germany . In 10 years at Arsenal I had three major partners: Steve Bould, Tony Adams and Sol Campbell. In seven seasons at City, Kompany has played with Richard Dunne, Micah Richards, Nedum Onuoha, Kolo Toure, Jerome Boateng, Joleon Lescott, Matija Nastasic, Martin Demichelis and now Eliaquim Mangala. That makes it almost impossible to build consistency as a unit. Kompany is so articulate and already speaks like a future manager so it’s no surprise that he plays in such an emphatic way. He is a fantastic ambassador and part of an excellent core at the club. For all their lavish spending, City are balancing that with a feeling of respect and there is genuine warmth around the club. But, if they’re not careful, the league title may suddenly start to slip from their grasp. Kompany is so often the man who tries to make sure that doesn’t happen, but he needs to ensure those rewards are gained by taking slightly fewer risks.","Vincent Kompany is a gambler and he is taking a big risk for the team .

"The Commonwealth Games have been hit by yet another drugs scandal after former world champion Amantle Montsho tested positive for a banned stimulant following the women’s 400 metres final on Tuesday. The 31-year-old Botswanan, who lost her world title in Moscow last year to Britain’s Christine Ohuruogu by four thousandths of a second, is the second athlete to fail a doping test in Glasgow. Nigerian weightlifter Chika Amalaha, 16, has already been stripped of her gold medal in the 53kg category after her A and B samples showed traces of a banned diuretic and masking agent. Doubt: Amantle Montsho (right) has failed a drugs test, the Commonwealth Games Federation has announced . Montsho’s A sample was found to contain methylhexaneamine, a banned stimulant that gives the body an energy boost by increasing its metabolic rate. The 2010 400m Commonwealth champion, who has been provisionally suspended after finishing fourth on Tuesday night, has asked for her B sample to be tested in London on Monday. Jamaican sprinter Yohan Blake, Usain Bolt’s training partner, missed the 2009 World Championships in Berlin and served a three-month ban after testing positive for methylhexaneamine, which can be found in some dietary supplements and is commonly used as a nasal decongestant, in June that year. Nigerian sprinter Damola Osayemi was also stripped of the 2010 Commonwealth 100m title after traces of the stimulant were found in her system. A spokesman for the Botswana team said: ‘There is nothing clear for now. ‘We’re hoping that in a few days we will see where it came from and what’s going to happen. It’s not that she’s been banned, just that she’s suspended prior to the investigation.’ Making sure: The 31-year-old will have her B sample tested on Monday .","Commonwealth Games confirm Amantle Montsho fails drugs test .

"England won so many medals at the Commonwealth Games in Glasgow — 174 in all and 58 gold, comfortably the most of the 71 competing nations — that it was easy to become complacent. ‘Oh look, we’ve picked up another one in the lawn bowls’. The nation topped the medals table in boxing, diving, gymnastics, triathlon and judo, where they were level with Scotland. England also came second in squash, cycling, table tennis, hockey, power-lifting, shooting and swimming. The numbers are so mind-boggling it doesn’t seem to mean very much after a while (as long as England are ahead of Australia, of course). That is not to disparage the men and women who have stood proudly on the podium, for you can only beat the opponent in front of you, but such enormous success deserves some context. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Glasgow a 'stand-out Games' - Hooper . On your marks: Sprinter Adam Gemili had a pretty successful 2014 Commonwealth Games in Glasgow . Podium finish: Gemili and his 4x100m team-mates pose with their silver medals after finishing second in the relay . FOUND the incessant noise about Usain Bolt deigning to rock up and run two relay legs in Glasgow annoying and disrespectful to other great Olympic champions, but he proved me wrong on Saturday. There is no showman in sport like Bolt — and how athletics needs him. THOUGHT we are in a dangerous place when a positive test from a 16-year-old weightlifter — Nigeria’s Chika Amalaha — was heralded as a sign that sport is winning the war on drugs. It is not the teenager who should be hung out to dry for having a diuretic and a masking agent in her system, but those who helped her get them. WATCHED live squash for the first time — and thought it was brilliant. Fast, feisty, demanding extraordinary levels of fitness and with equal medals on offer for men and women — how is it not an Olympic sport and golf is? Will the might of the USA and China, who finished first and second in the medals table at London 2012, be losing sleep as they try and make sense of this slightly odd, antiquated 11-day festival of sport the British monarch rules over every four years? It is doubtful. Nearly half of England’s medals came in the ‘optional’ sports at these Games; disciplines that a host nation can choose to include depending on how good they are at them, essentially. This seems an entirely fitting approach for a competition made up of countries that once belonged to the British Empire, mind you. We’re going to put on a rather nice sports day, but we’re only going to play the games we like. Now would you like some tea? Judo, triathlon and gymnastics came into this category in 2014, but Glasgow could equally have picked ten-pin bowling or softball if they had really wanted to wind up their neighbours across the border. Thankfully, Scotland recognised that home nations success would sell, and the Games have been a better spectacle for it. But, as thoughts turn to the 2016 Olympics in Rio, rallying cries about Britain’s chances of success must be measured. Daniel Keatings’ score to win gold on the pommel horse, for example, was the one gymnastics display that would have been worthy of a medal — bronze — at London 2012. There were four pairs entered for the men’s 10m synchronised diving event, so only gold and silver medals were awarded. The season’s bests which Katarina Johnson-Thompson, who missed the Games with a foot injury, set in 2014 would have been good enough to win the women’s heptathlon, high jump and long jump in Glasgow. Success: Claudia Fragapane is pictured with her four Artistic Gymnastics gold medals at the SECC . VIDEO Glasgow a 'stand-out Games' - Hooper . Right direction: Ross Murdoch picked up a bronze medal at the Commonwealth Games . So many to choose from. I loved seeing Scots Hannah Miley, Eilidh Child and Lynsey Sharp defy the burden of home pressure to reach the podium. Equally thrilling was watching 40-year-old Jo Pavey take it to the Kenyans in the 5,000m, just 10 months after giving birth to her second child. What a gutsy display. It is not realistic to frame these Games as the pinnacle of sporting achievement — we should celebrate them as an entertaining stepping stone. They can then keep the joyous peculiarities of a 79-year-old playing lawn bowls or a chap from the Solomon Islands being lapped three times in the 5,000m final and yet still retain their relevance. It’s been thrilling to see home-grown youngsters grasp their opportunities with no Chinese, American or Russian competitors to get in the way, and then immediately talk of how these Games will be a springboard for future success. Think of 16-year-old gymnast Claudia Fragapane (left) and her four gold medals; Ross Murdoch, who beat fellow Scot Michael Jamieson to win 200m breaststroke gold; or sprinter Adam Gemili, who won two silvers. It is athletes like these we should pick out when trying to make sense of that dizzyingly successful medal table. The brilliantly bonkers stories about the endless list of husband-and-wife partnerships are what make the Games unique, but these tales could also be its downfall if you start analysing the standard of some of the sports too closely. The Commonwealths’ wonderful inclusivity — the thought that, actually, you could be capable of being on the Gold Coast in four years’ time if you could find a not-too-distant relative in Jersey — has played a key part in its success. But it is the platform it has provided for some of our stars of the future that will see it endure. Justin Gatlin and Tyson Gay, two sprinters back after serving doping bans, were accused of ‘ruining the whole season’ by a fan on Twitter. Gay hit back, saying ‘OK lol’, while Gatlin’s advice was ‘turn your TV off then’. Both will run at the well-paid Diamond League circuit in Brussels in September.","England topped the medals table in boxing, diving, gymnastics and judo .

"DOUBLES DELIGHT FOR ENGLAND . Alison Waters and Peter Barker won silver for England in the squash mixed doubles after losing 11-8, 11-10 to Australia’s Rachael Grinham and David Palmer in the final. Earlier, England’s James Willstrop and Daryl Selby secured bronze in the men’s doubles by defeating Scotland’s Harry Leitch and Alan Clyne.

"The coaches of 16-year-old weightlifter Chika Amalaha will be investigated after the Nigerian was stripped of her Commonwealth gold for failing a drugs test. The International Weightlifting Federation (IWF) has announced it will ‘seriously investigate’ Amalaha’s entourage to find out how she came to have amiloride and hydrochlorothiazide, a banned diuretic and masking agent, in her system. The case has also been referred to the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA), with Amalaha likely to receive a two-year ban for a first-time offence.

"Clipping the eight barrier in the 110 metres hurdles proved the difference for William Sharman on Tuesday night, as the 29-year-old had to settle for Commonwealth silver once again. Frustration was etched over Sharman’s face as he watched a replay and realised just how close he had come to winning the Commonwealth title: just four- hundredths of a second, squandered after he was knocked slightly off balance after hurdle eight. Jamaica’s Andrew Riley, a much quicker sprinter over the flat, drove to gold to Sharman’s right in the final metres as the Englishman finished second in 13.36secs. Close: William Sharman on his way to winning silver in the men's 110m hurdles . Sharman also won a silver behind England’s Andy Turner four years ago in Delhi and, following the withdrawal of world No1 Hansle Parchment of Jamaica, this was the classically trained pianist’s big chance to win a major title. Speaking on the BBC, 400m world record-holder Michael Johnson said: ‘It’s a shame for Will Sharman. I think he knows he’ll never be a world champion and that was probably his opportunity of a gold medal on the big stage.’ Lawrence Clarke, a bronze medallist in 2010, finished last in the final and earlier on Tuesday Turner experienced one of his most ‘devastating days on the track’ when he crashed out in qualifying. The defending champion, 33, hit the first and second hurdles and failed to complete the race in what could well be his last season on the track. But where a silver for Sharman will always prompt thoughts of what might have been, England’s Laura Samuel was deservedly delighted by her second place in the triple jump. The 23-year-old from Leicester delivered the performance of her career so far, leaping 14.09metres —34 centimetres beyond her 2012 personal best — in the second round to seal silver behind Kimberly  Williams from Jamaica, who jumped 14.21m. Almost: Sharman was unlucky not to be celebrating a gold medal win on Tuesday night . Runner-up: Ashley Bryant won silver for England in the men's decathlon . Struggle: Andy Turner (right) hits the hurdle as he competes in men's 110m hurdles . There was also a third silver medal for England at Hampden Park on Tuesday night, as Ashley Bryant came second in the decathlon. The 23-year-old was third going into the final event, the gruelling 1500m, but finished nine second ahead of Kurt Felix of Grenada to take silver behind Damian Warner of Canada. It was a fitting comeback for the decathlete, who scored 8,109 points, after he was forced to pull out of last year’s World Championships in Moscow with a hamstring tear. Greg Rutherford, the only remaining London 2012 gold medallist competing for England at Hampden Park, reached Wednesday night's long jump final with his first qualifying jump of 8.05m on Tuesday  morning, but admitted he was ‘held together by tape’. Ambition: Greg Rutherford will be looking for long jump gold on Wednesday evening . The 27-year-old pulled out of two warm-up events prior to the Commonwealths to prevent any further damage to a knee injury and did not sound convincing when asked his fitness. Rutherford, who joins Englishmen Chris Tomlinson and JJ Jegede in the final, said: ‘I’m in pretty good form — held together by tape, but feeling pretty good.‘(The knee) is fine. I’m here, I jumped and it’s okay. You manage these things and I’m feeling pretty good. ‘I should do well at these Games and if I don’t it’s a huge disappointment. I’m here to do well and that’s what I expect.’ In the way: England's Andrew Osagie (second left) tussles with Welsh runner Joe Thomas . Jersey sent a three-strong table tennis team to the Games for the first time. But Craig Gascoyne showed his inexperience at 3-1 down to Mohamed Shakirin Ibrahim of Malaysia in his first match. ‘I thought it was the best of five games,’ said Gascoyne, 30. ‘I didn’t realise it was seven. I was about to shake hands!’ Ibrahim didn’t have to wait long for a handshake, taking the next game and the match. Olympic champion and world record-holder David Rudisha was the fastest qualifier for Wednesday's 800m semi-finals, but there was disappointment for London 2012 finalist Andrew Osagie. The Englishman was disqualified for cutting across Wales’ Joe Thomas as the pair jostled for position in the final metres. Osagie said: ‘There was a scuffle and there were people looking for gaps that weren’t there.‘I would say it was not his space and you can always go round people. If you don’t you will cause a collision. ‘That happened to me at the trials and somebody clipped my hamstring, and that has affected me coming into these championships.’ Your fault: The English 800m runner wasn't happy with training partner .","William Sharman wins silver in 110m hurdles after stumbling .

"Former world 400m hurdles champion Dai Greene has said it is 'disappointing' all Commonwealth Games medallists will not automatically be drug-tested, and insisted his fellow Welshmen Gareth Warburton and Rhys Williams are not 'deliberate cheaters'. The Commonwealth Games Federation (CGF) has adopted a 'quality over quantity' approach to anti-doping measures in Glasgow, with specific sports being targeted instead of asking all medallists to provide urine or blood samples. 'I am surprised by that,' said Greene. 'You can't test enough, really. For everyone to be tested is the way forward, in my mind, and our sport will become cleaner because of more testing I think. So that's disappointing.' Not good enough: Dai Green couldn't make it through in his Commonwealth 400m hurdles heat . Trailing: Greene was disappointed but said he already knew he may not have been good enough . Banned: Gareth Warburton, Greene's former housemate, was not able to take his place in Glasgow . Dragon: Fellow Welshman Rhys Williams, who Greene admits not seeing eye-to-eye to, is also banned . Greene's former housemate Warburton, 32, and Williams, 30, were both suspended from the Wales team after testing positive for banned substances before the Games began. The exact nature of the drugs involved have not been disclosed, but the pair use the same range of supplements, Mountain Fuel, which are not listed on the Informed-Sport website, either in the list of registered or batch-tested products. Athletes are urged to cross-check this website for accredited supplements that should be safe and legal for them to use, although the resource still does not offer a 100 per cent guarantee. Greene said: 'When Gaz found out he texted me and I was really quite upset about it because I know Gaz and lived with him for a few years. He’s not that kind of guy. 'He lived off raisins and cous cous because he couldn't afford anything else, so I don't think he's organising a drugs ring. 'Hopefully they can get to the bottom of things and find things out because I do believe that they are not deliberate cheaters. They have probably just been careless or misled slightly. That will come out eventually I’m sure. 'Even though me and Rhys don’t really get on, I know he’s not the sort of person to deliberately cheat. I don’t think anybody in the Welsh or British team honestly believes they have gone out of their way to cheat. I’ve not known anyone who has been in their situation before so it was a big shock for me. 'It’s just unfortunate but as professional athletes we’ve got to learnt not to take anything that isn’t batch tested. Hopefully other people will learn from it.' Lagging: Greene fell away after a decent start to his Commonwealth title defence . Warburton and Williams, who both deny 'knowingly taking any banned substances' have been suspended from all competition pending the outcome of their appeals, which will not take place until September at the earliest. Greene said he expected any ban to extend into next season, but advised his Wales team-mates had already been punished enough by missing the Commonwealth Games and next month's European Championships. The 28-year-old added: 'There’s bound to be a punishment because you can’t get away with having steroids or whatever else in your system. But, hopefully they will look at the situation. Strange behaviour: One of the reason's Greene says Warburton can't be a drugs cheat was his diet - the 800m runner apparently lived off a diet of raisins and cous cous . 'They’ve already been punished quite severely in terms of missing the Commonwealths – they will be too old at the next one to be in any shape so that’s a massive knock. 'They had ambitions to be at the Europeans as well so that’s two championships they are going to miss. The ban they will probably get will go into next season as well so they will get punished for it. 'They haven’t deliberately taken anything but they will be punished for it. I can’t imagine being in that situation. Hopefully they can come back from this as stronger athletes and continue their careers because they are past 30 now. I do feel sorry for them in that regard.'

"Jamaican discus thrower Chad Wright dazzled spectators at Hampden Park with an impressive performance and some equally impressive socks. The 23-year-old was sporting some rather sharp footwear in the qualifiers and his throw of 61.08m  saw him through to the final. Sock it to them: Chad Wright turned heads in the discus with his choice of attire and his performance . Diving is supposed to be a sport of great grace and composure, but Malaysian diver Ahmad Amsyar Azman ended up falling flat on his face in the preliminary round of the men’s 1m springboard. His attempt to pull off a particularly tricky dive ended in disaster after he failed to complete his final forward rotation and he ended up hitting the water on the horizontal. He still managed to qualify, though. Flat out: Ahmad Azman's landing left much to be desired . Olympic champion Sally Pearson has been slammed by Australia’s head athletics coach hours before she begins the defence of her Commonwealth 100m hurdles title. Pearson, 27, was fined by Athletics Australia for missing a pre-Games training camp but Eric Hollingsworth labelled her ‘a bad example to the entire national team’. The pair have not spoken since falling out in March. At loggerheads: Sally Pearson and Eric Hollingsworth . Hollingsworth, though, faces suspension or even the sack for his comments, with Athletics Australia deeply upset by his actions. Meanwhile, a man detained by police over an altercation at the athletes’ village early yesterday morning is believed to be a member of the Australian team. England’s James Ellington made the 200m semi-finals after getting some added motivation from his Jamaican opponent, Jason Livermore. He said: ‘It was quite easy but I was nervous as I was up at 6.55am and I hate early mornings. That clown (Livermore) on the outside gave me the motivation because he was making noise in the call room. ‘You shouldn’t do that because that makes me run faster. As long as he does that in the semi-final then I’m going to get him.’ The semis are from 6.25pm. Feisty: James Ellington (right) and Jason Livermore in their 200m heat . Golden Gunde from Malawi, 21, didn’t quite live up to his sensational name in the men’s 200m heats. He had the slowest reaction time and finished last — or 007th — in 22.39secs. Maybe he should have entered the shooting instead... Rio Ferdinand might have found himself a new sport. The defender seemed to enjoy England’s 2-1 win over Scotland in the women’s hockey, which sealed England’s place in the semi-finals. ‘I’m into this hockey,’ he tweeted. ‘I wish our refs communicated like these hockey refs!’ He also approved of England’s prowess in front of goal: ‘Alex Danson — what a goal! Silky.’ Scotland's James Heatly had quite a lot to live up to at the diving centre. The 17-year-old’s grandfather  Sir Peter Heatly, who turned 90 last month, was a diver at the Commonwealth Games in 1950, 1954 and 1958, and he won gold medals in all three. With the pressure on, Heatly the younger could only manage a 9th-place finish in the 1m springboard yesterday, but he does have another chance to emulate his grandfather and add to the family haul in the 3m springboard.","Jamaican discus thrower Chad Wright dazzled spectators with an impressive performance and some equally impressive socks .

"A 16-year-old Nigerian girl who won weightlifting gold faces being stripped of her title after providing the first in-competition positive drugs test of the Commonwealth Games. Sir Craig Reedie, president of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA), expressed his shock that an athlete as young as Chika Amalaha should test positive for banned substances. The teenager became the youngest female winner of a Commonwealth weightlifting title when she scooped gold in the 53kg class last Friday, but will be disqualified today if her ‘B’ sample results match those of her ‘A’ sample, which showed traces of a banned diuretic and masking agent. Doubt: Nigerian weightlifting gold medalist Chika Amalaha has failed a doping test at Commonwealth Games . Reedie said: ‘I am very disappointed that somebody as young as that appears to have committed an offence at a multi-sport event like the Commonwealth Games.’ If Amalaha is stripped of her gold medal, it is understood WADA will investigate how such a young athlete was given access to illegal substances. Her positive test also prompted questions about weightlifting’s legitimacy as a Commonwealth sport. The event has a history of drug-related incidents, while Nigeria was barred from the 2002 Games in Manchester after four athletes tested positive in 2001. But Mike Hooper, chief executive of the Commonwealth Games Federation (CGF), said: ‘I think weightlifting is a fantastic sport and a strong Commonwealth and Olympic sport. ‘I think the issue here is about showing we have a robust anti-doping programme in place.’ Before: Amalaha (centre) celebrates winning women's weightlifting 53kg class gold .

I’m just happy I’ve done what I wanted to do in the sport. ‘I remember asking Michael Johnson why he retired when he was at the top and he told me that there was nothing else for him to accomplish so I think that when you’re in the sport and you’ve accomplished everything else then you should just retire. ‘There’s all these young kids coming up and I might start getting beaten and I hate losing.’ The Jamaican is prone to making off-the-cuff statements about his legacy and ‘legend’ but, as he looked to his right and saw England’s silver medal-winning relay quartet — with an average age of just 23 — his words seemed to carry particular resonance. At 27, Bolt is far from finished, . despite seeing much of this season wiped out by the foot injury he . suffered in April, but it is getting harder, even for him. His . appeal is stronger than ever — he signed hundreds of autographs and . smiled for umpteen ‘selfies’ during a protracted 45-minute lap of honour . wearing a tartan bonnet and scarf on Saturday — but, physically, time . is starting to take its toll in terms of the effort he has to put into . training. Funny man: Bolt is known for his larger than life personality as well as his outstanding running ability . Admiration: Athletics will be losing a sporting icon when Bolt does choose to retire from the sport . VIDEO Glasgow see out 'outstanding' Commonwealth Games . ‘Track-wise, you can feel the difference sometimes, especially after the workouts,’ he said. ‘I have to take more ice baths now, which is not so much fun. ‘You have to work a little bit harder, put a little bit more work in and I don’t go out as much as I used to.’ The nagging question of how Bolt can remain motivated after achieving everything in his sport is more pertinent than ever, but the Jamaican still feels he has one more world record left in him. Bolt thinks he has ‘done the 100m’ after running 9.58secs in Berlin five years ago, but believes he could become the first man to break the 19-second barrier for the 200m. His current world record is 19.19secs. He said: ‘I want to run under 19secs. That is one of my biggest goals, one of my biggest dreams. Definitely. ‘I don’t know whether breaking nine seconds for the 100m is possible. The world keeps going round, and you never know who will show up next and dominate. ‘For me, my main aim is the 200m, not the 100m. I think I have done the 100m. I want to do something special for me over the 200m.","Usain Bolt is thinking about hanging up his spikes in the near future .

"Defending 110m hurdles champion Andy Turner was 'devastated' after crashing out of the Commonwealth Games in qualifying on Tuesday. The 33-year-old hit the first and second hurdles and failed to complete the race in what could be his last season on the track. Turner, a former world bronze medallist, insisted he was determined 'not to go out like this' and hoped to redeem himself at next month's European Championships in Zurich. Blow: Andy Turner crashed out in the 110m heats at the Commonwealth Games . He added: 'It's one of the most devastating days on the track. I injured two of my Achilles tendons last year, my mum passed away and this is my first Championship back. 'I never thought I would be here in the first place but I don't just want to make up the numbers or do mistakes like that, I want to push to win a medal. 'But I made a crucial mistake at the first hurdle and that cost me even finishing the race. I haven't made that mistake all year and, to do it here, it's a schoolboy mistake.

"Adam Gemili truly announced himself on the global stage on Monday night as the 20-year-old won a Commonwealth silver medal in the men's 100 metres. Gemili finished second in 10.10secs behind 22-year-old Jamaican Kemar Bailey-Cole, whose long, loping strides allowed him to reel in the Englishman after his explosive start to win in 10secs flat. Nickel Ashmeade, the Jamaican champion, was third in 10.12secs. Gemili's time may not have been as quick as the 10.07secs he clocked in the semi-final and he has still to break that magical 10-second barrier but, quite frankly, who cares. That will come.

Shocked: Gemili covers his face after realising that he's pipped Nickel Ashmeade to second place . More pertinent was the fact this prodigiously talented, yet still raw, sprinter soaked up the warmth of the Hampden Park crowd, smiled broadly when he was introduced and then managed to split two world-class Jamaican sprinters to earn his place on the podium and his first senior medal. Bailey-Cole, after all, is part of Usain Bolt's training group working under coach Glen Mills in Kingston and, at 6ft 4in tall, bears more than a passing resemblance to the world's fastest man. Yet Gemili's was also an exceptional performance of confidence and class, delivered when it really mattered. It was also an emphatic response to Michael Johnson's criticism of Gemili's refreshingly enthusiastic and endearing approach to his craft.

'Hopefully I can keep progressing and to use this as a stepping stone to be more established in the senior ranks. 'I just love running at major championships. The main thing is that the crowd give me energy that I need. 'Michael Johnson is such a well-established man, but that is how I run. I can focus. 'I train with a smile on my face. I enjoy what I do.

"Willy Twiston-Davies believes the fifth-placed finish of First Class Mail on his second career start at Brighton should not be taken too negatively. The Daily Mail and Mail Online are experiencing the ownership experience this summer with the chestnut colt trained by Mick Channon. Hopes were high that our horse could step up on a promising debut sixth at Windsor but, ill at ease on Brighton’s undulations, First Class Mail could never reach a threatening position before running on when meeting the rising ground in the final furlong.

Twiston-Davies said: ‘He didn’t like the ground, which has become very fast, or the track and he was taken off his feet in the early stages. ‘There are more positives than negatives to that run and, maybe, we should look to trying seven furlongs.

He is not be the first inexperienced horse to find the course at Brighton tricky to handle but should hopefully learn from the experience.

"Do not follow me if you want to win a medal, was David Rudisha’s friendly advice to Kenyan team-mate Timothy Kitum before he stunned the world by setting a world record of 1min 40.91sec to win Olympic 800 metres gold at London 2012. He knew nobody would be able to live with the pace he planned to run. Rudisha’s was the stand-out performance of the Games; arguably not only on the track but of the entire Olympics. Lord Coe, who held the 800m world record for 16 years, called it the most extraordinary piece of running he had ever seen and the greatest 800m run. It will be impossible for Rudisha to recreate the magic of those 100 seconds at Hampden Park over the next three days, but we should still expect another majestic performance from one of the world’s greatest athletes in one of the track’s toughest disciplines. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Commonwealth Games - Day 5 review . Man to beat: Kenya's David Rudisha is favourite to win gold in the 800 metres final in Glasgow . Record breaker: Rudisha shows off his world record after winning gold at the London 2012 Olympic Games . Usain Bolt may only be turning up to run . a couple of relay legs in the 4x100m, but the Commonwealth 800m title . is one this tall, softly-spoken Maasai is desperate to win. ‘The 800m is the most unforgiving distance,’ said Coe. ‘You are running 80 per cent of the race without oxygen. I call it “the killing zone”. I think 800m is the toughest distance on the track. It demands so many different things: the endurance of a 5,000m runner and the speed of a world-class 800m runner.’ To make things even harder, Rudisha will face Nijel Amos from Botswana. The 20-year-old won silver in London and beat Rudisha into fifth place in Monaco this month by running 1:42.45, the fastest time in the world this year. Rudisha missed last season with a knee injury, but returned to British soil in the Diamond League meeting at Hampden to win comfortably in 1:43.34. Rudisha, after all, knows only one way to run — from the front — which is why experts believe he could go even quicker. Talking tactics: Rudisha's coach, Brother Colm O'Connell (left), says his man likes to lead from the front after previous disappointments . More to come: Some experts believe Rudisha is capable of running under 100 seconds in Glasgow . VIDEO Commonwealth Games - Day 5 review . Dr Jamie . Pringle, lead physiologist at the English Institute of Sport, said: . ‘Aerodynamically, sitting on someone else’s shoulder saves you a lot of . energy, which you can save for that final kick. ‘But . Rudisha likes to run from the front, usually as soon as he can break . after the first 200m, which is run in lanes. That’s what made his . performance in London so remarkable. ‘He has to work harder and the people trying to hang on behind him are benefiting from running in his draft. He could perhaps run even faster if there were people he could sit behind. You need a pacemaker who’s the world’s best over 400m and can hang on until 600m.’ Rudisha has been coy about breaking the 100-second barrier but said: ‘London was an Olympic final and I did it without a pacemaker,’ he said. ‘If I can catch the right pacing and the right conditions we might do better.’ Running from the front was a tactic the former 400m athlete, whose father Daniel won Olympic gold in the 4x400m relay in 1968, adopted after he failed to make the final at the 2009 World Championships in Berlin. Rudisha’s coach, Irish missionary Brother Colm O’Connell, said: ‘I think he just turned over a new leaf and said: “I’m never going to be caught like that again”.’ In 2010 Rudisha set two world 800m records in a week. A comparison of David Rudisha and Sebastian Coe's most memorable races . O’Connell first spotted Rudisha running 200m in 2004 and invited him to a training camp. The 16-year-old was given a pair of second-hand size 10 spikes and, in his first outing over two laps of the track, he ran 1min 50secs. Rudisha has clearly long been an exceptional athlete. The question is: how good could he be if someone does have the talent to follow him? Dr Paul Worsfold, head of biomechanics at the English Institute of Sport, discusses Rudisha's best attributes. STANDING TALL . At 6ft 3in, Rudisha is a tall athlete — much taller than Britain’s finest 800m runner, Sebastian Coe — and he maintains an upward stance while running. A lot of athletes tilt their hips but he doesn’t do that, or lean too far forwards. STRIDES AHEAD . Like Usain Bolt he has a long stride length and covers lots of distance with his long limbs, but he doesn’t over-stride or place his foot too far in front of him, which would act as a brake.Coe’s gait and stride pattern were shorter and quicker but Rudisha’s stride length allows him to maintain velocity throughout the whole race. SMOOTH OPERATOR . He’s very smooth in the way he runs. There is not much vertical displacement — everything’s horizontal — which means he doesn’t lose energy unnecessarily. Rudisha doesn’t bounce like a lot of marathon or long distance runners. MUSCLE MAN . Rudisha is a very muscular guy, he doesn’t seem to rotate the upper body too much and is very stable in his core, which gives him a lot of control and does not waste energy. TOTAL PACKAGE . There have got to be natural genetics at play, in terms of his muscle fibres and his height, and he really does have the ideal body type. But you can tell he has worked very hard on his biomechanics. He’s not perfect but he’s technically very, very good and, like Bolt, he knows what works for him.","Rudisha is favourite to win gold in the 800 metres at the Games .

"Speed. Pure, unadulterated acceleration with gears to spare. It’s what makes Usain Bolt a track icon and its pursuit fuels the multi-million pound F1 circuit. It was the also the underlying theme of a memorable opening day at the biggest Flat meeting of the season. Twice Richard Hughes experienced that wind in the hair feeling most of us can only expect on a roller-coaster. First odds-on favourite Toronado carried him up the straight mile faster than the dual champion claimed he could ever recall to land the Queen Anne Stakes by three-quarters of length from Verrazano, giving new trainer Richard Hannon a winner at this meeting with his first runner. Hail the new king: Kingman and James Doyle sweep past long-time leader Night Of Thunder to win in devastating style . Then Sole Power, in the words of Hughes, ‘made up ‘five lengths in 50 yards’ to capture the King’s Stand Stakes for the second successive year. But Hughes, riding 2,000 Guineas winner Night of Thunder, was left facing the back draft from the most spectacular burst of pace as Kingman and James Doyle engaged the after-burner and flew to victory in the St James’s Palace Stakes. When the pair had met in the 2,000 Guineas at Newmarket, it had been Night of Thunder who won but the tactical nature of the race had left questions hanging in the air as to who really was the best. When Kingman subsequently romped home in the Irish 2,000 Guineas, the debate became even louder. Doyle turns around to taunt his rivals as Kingman proves much the best in the St James's Palace Stakes . Hughes tried to tactically wrong-foot his younger weighing room rival by unexpectedly making the running on Night Of Thunder but it proved a fruitless gesture as Kingman’s demolition – the two-and-a-quarter-length margin does not do his superiority justice – emphatically settled the argument over who is the best. In his moment of triumph, Doyle spontaneously turned to his rivals, putting his finger to his lips. Afterwards, he admitted to be touch embarrassed by the gesture. He need not have been. He had just been part of one of those sporting moments that send a frisson of excitement down the spine. It was the sort of ride Doyle must have hoped for when last summer he was signed up by Kingman’s owner Prince Khaled Abdullah and one probably not seen at Royal Ascot since another colt carrying the Abdullah silks, a certain Frankel, blitzed his way to victory in the 2012 Queen Anne Stakes. Doyle said: ‘I probably let my emotions get the better of me crossing the line as I got so much satisfaction from that. All smiles: Doyle couldn't hide his joy at Kingman's stellar performance . ‘A lot horse has been said about the 2,000 Guineas and it just proves he is the best three-year-old over a mile. ‘I was very confident today. I didn’t think Night Of Thunder could beat us. ‘Everyone thought he wasn’t a champion after the Guineas but he  has put that well behind him now.’ Gosden, winning the St James’s Palace Stakes for the first time, added: ‘Despite losing in the Guineas I always took the opinion he was the better horse. You push an button and he is away.’ Gosden will now aim Kingman at next month’s Sussex Stakes at Glorious Goodwood lining up a heavyweight clash with Toronado, who justified all the bold words of Hannon in the build up to the meeting. Horse Power: Sole Power (left) showed a devastating turn of foot to hit the front in the final furlong . Sole Power could make a much quicker reappearance with trainer Eddie Lynam considering running the sprinter alongside stablemate Slade Power in Saturday’s Diamond Jubilee Stakes. Channel 4 have signed up Frankie Dettori to add some pizzazz to their under scrutiny coverage so it was appropriate the Italian should land the Coventry Stakes on John Quinn-trained The Wow Factor. Dettori, who drew a blank at this meeting last year, needs only two more wins to make it 50 at the royal meeting. On a day when pace was king, US flyer Hootenanny was provided the perfect finale to win the Windsor Castle Stakes, justifying trainer Wesley Ward’s belief that colt was the best chance of six runners  at the meeting.

"This is a massive game for Stuart Lancaster and this England team. So far he has done an excellent job and now has a very exciting team and a squad to match any in world rugby but if he could go to the World Cup as Grand Slam-winning coach it would be absolutely massive for him and the team. As we stand, for all his hard work and endeavour, Lancaster has won nothing whereas his opposite man, Joe Schmidt, has won plenty of silverware and is widely regarded as the best coach in the world. But make no mistake, if England do win today — and I believe they will — it will make them red-hot favourites for the Grand Slam and allow them to set sail for the World Cup in perfect fashion. England warm up during the captain's run at the Aviva Stadium the day before their clash with Ireland . Stuart Lancaster could take a huge step to winning the Six Nations by leading England to success over Ireland . Lancaster knows a Six Nations triumph would be perfect for his team ahead of the 2015 World Cup . Lancaster's opposite number, Joe Schmidt (left), is widely regarded as the best coach in the world . I just cannot see Scotland or France heading to Twickenham and winning, so today’s game will go a very long way to deciding if England can begin a home World Cup as the No 1 side in Europe. What a prospect. In 2003, we went to Dublin and won well against an Irish side who were also going for the Grand Slam. It was unquestionably a defining moment, allowing us to arrive at the World Cup as firm favourites and the team everyone had to beat. To my mind this game is every bit as important to English rugby as that. I’m sure that the RFU will be happy with the progress England have made since Lancaster took over three years ago. Despite some pretty conservative selections, some game-plans which were hard to fathom and the frustrations in the autumn, I believe the fans and media are also right behind him and his team. But heading into today’s game, I sense a change in the air. There is greater expectancy than ever under Lancaster for England to win a really big game like this, especially away from home. It wasn’t there in the autumn and it wasn’t there against Wales where everyone seemed happy to be billed as the underdogs. But such expectancy makes it a defining game for Lancaster. He and England should accept that in many people’s eyes, including mine, they are favourites today based on the quality of their players and they should thrive on that expectation. England romped to a 47-17 victory over Italy in their last Six Nations game, played at Twickenham . England head coach Lancaster (right) congratulates Jonathan Jospeh (left) after the win against Italy . England begun the Six Nations with a 21-16 win against Wales at the Millenium Stadium . This expectation is long overdue and it is a good thing. It is a sign of progress and something every great team need to become comfortable with. Lancaster and England need to embrace the expectation. Ireland are going to have to play out of their skins to win today — that should be the mentality of this team. In big games like this, I always look to see if a team do something differently and unexpected in the early stages. It was something I always looked to engineer. Schmidt is an outstanding coach who is utterly meticulous with his preparation — you only have to speak to players who have worked with him to understand just how highly rated he is. Ireland’s success over the last 12 months is squarely down to him — and the level of analysis which he and his players will have done will have been huge. So for England to do the unexpected early on will really give Ireland something to think about; they will realise they are up against a clever team. Players do not like surprises, so England need to take Ireland outside of their comfort zone in the early stages. Like any good business or sports leader, Lancaster has done the clever thing by surrounding himself with outstanding people. My confidants were Andy Robinson and Phil Larder, who were men I admired enormously as coaches. I would listen to them for hours before making any final decisions, especially on selection. Lancaster has brought in Andy Farrell and Mike Catt, while Graham Rowntree was already in place. It is really important he allows them to challenge his decision-making process. But ultimately, no matter how much input you get from your coaching team, it is the head coach who makes the final decision and he must live or die by it. People talk about the loneliness of command and being the England rugby head coach is a lonely position. The buck stops with you. But it can also be enormously rewarding and can bring extraordinary highs as well as inevitable lows. In rugby, it is the best job in the world. I’ve seen some clear signs of improvement and development from Lancaster who, let’s not forget, was appointed with no international coaching experience. He has had to learn on the hoof and I’m delighted by his selection of Jack Nowell. Sir Clive Woodward praised Lancaster's coaching team of Mike Catt, Graham Rowntree and Andy Farrell . Woodward also lauded Lancaster for selecting full back Jack Nowell to play against Ireland . Woodward believes England's squad can compete at the World Cup and beating Ireland would be a landmark . Changing a winning team is never easy and it gives a firm indication he is thinking correctly and clearly. He needs to continue to be bold as this team are developing into something special. I also think he is learning the art of substitution. It is not an exact science, nor can it be all about pre-determined decisions of when to bring a player off. But it is a critical part of a head coach’s role. If you get that spectacularly wrong it can have an enormously detrimental impact on your standing within the squad and the media will have a field day. There is a lot resting on his shoulders. But if I was Lancaster, I’d be incredibly excited about what lies in store. This is England’s best chance to win a World Cup since 2003 with a tournament being played on home soil with a high-quality squad good enough to win it. Beat Ireland and I firmly believe England will win the Grand Slam and go into the World Cup as clearly the best team in Europe, with somebody having to come to Twickenham to beat them. Lose, and all the momentum will be with Ireland. England need to play with tempo and an enormous amount of aggression to beat Ireland. They need to explode out of the blocks and concentrate on their game and not the huge prize on offer. Do that and England will be on course for a Grand Slam and a 2015 World Cup — and lauded like no other. For Lancaster to earn his stripes, England must win by five points.","England could seize the initiative in the Six Nations by beating Ireland .

"Danielle Reeves, 24, from Caterham, Surrey, pleaded guilty to manslaughter . When her one-year-old son was pulled limp and lifeless from an overfilled bath, drunken Danielle Reeves screamed with rage and blamed those around her. She lied to paramedics and even said her other son – aged only three – was responsible for the tragedy. But as she was jailed for almost four years yesterday, the young mother of two had to face up to the fact that just one person was truly to blame: herself. Reeves had left little Frankie Joe in the bath, with only his older brother Alfie for company, while she spent 45 minutes chatting with neighbours outside her home in Redhill, Surrey. She told one that she was ‘so drunk’ on vodka. By the time the mother – a foul-mouthed, binge-drinking, cannabis-smoking 24-year-old – thought to check on her sons, the water in the bath was full to the overflow. Frankie died in hospital four days later, the day after his first birthday. Yesterday Reeves, who admitted manslaughter when she appeared in court last month, broke into choking sobs as she was sentenced. ‘You totally abandoned your responsibilities as the mother of a baby at bathtime,’ said Judge Christopher Critchlow. ‘You completely overlooked the risk to him of being unattended and not just for a moment or two, but for a very long time.’ Compounding her neglect, Reeves repeatedly lied, first to paramedics whom she reduced to tears with her display of anger, then to other members of the emergency team, claiming she had left the children for just a few minutes. Today, as she begins her 45-month sentence, the Mail can reveal the extent of her feckless behaviour. Her appearance at Guildford Crown Court yesterday was by no means her first brush with the law. Six years ago, a sobbing Reeves, then only 18, stood in the dock at the Old Bailey charged with murder. She was accused, with two 17-year-old boys, of beating a trainee fitness instructor to death, while another man filmed the attack on his mobile phone. Reeves was jailed for 45 months at Guildford Crown Court, pictured above, for manslaughter of her son Frankie-Joe after she left him and his brother Alfie unsupervised in a bath for up to 50 minutes . Reeves was said to have encouraged Andrew Elvin and Caine Hallett, who kicked and punched Luke Salisbury, 30, to death, then stripped him naked and left his body in a rubbish-strewn hallway. Elvin was found guilty of murder and Hallett of manslaughter. Reeves, who claimed she tried to stop the attack, was cleared of murder and the jury failed to reach a verdict on an alternative count of manslaughter. The prosecution subsequently dropped the case. In the aftermath, the teenage Reeves was forced to leave the housing association semi in Epsom, Surrey, where she lived with single mother Dawn, 44, moving to nearby Banstead. Stability appeared to beckon for Reeves when she met her partner, whom the Mail cannot name for legal reasons. The couple already had Alfie when they moved to the flats in Redhill in late 2009. But Reeves swiftly upset neighbours and was often heard shouting. Alfie was once even seen wandering through a car park, alone and wearing only a vest. ‘She was always smoking drugs, cannabis,’ said a neighbour who did not want to be named. ‘She would come over swearing and shouting. I had to call the police on her so many times. ‘Most of the time she was living here I felt I couldn’t stay here, I went to my mum’s quite a lot. ‘It’s pretty much all drink-related. I’ve seen her outside smoking cannabis before and even with the windows closed you could smell it. She was smoking cannabis on the day she brought the baby home.’ The scene: Reeves left her sons alone in a bath in a block of flats in Redhill, Surrey, pictured above, to drink wine with her neighbours . The neighbour was at home on the day in September last year that the tragedy happened. It was mid-afternoon when the woman spotted Reeves’s partner leave, and heard her chatting with another neighbour. She recalled: ‘When she first came out she said, “I’m so drunk.” I said, “Have you been drinking wine?” and she said, “No, vodka, I’ve had so much vodka”. We kept hearing Alfie screaming and she kept shouting, “Sit down Alfie, sit down”.’ Puzzled, she asked if the little boy was trying to climb over the stairgate, but was told by Reeves the toddler was in the bath. ‘Frankie was never mentioned  and I just thought he would be sleeping,’ she said. ‘It didn’t cross my mind that he was in the bath too.’ Incredibly, the neighbour heard Reeves shout instructions  to Alfie to turn the shower on to amuse himself. ‘It wasn’t until about 40 minutes later that she said she was going to get Alfie out of the bath and dressed, and went in. ‘About 15 seconds later she slung the back door open and was screaming my name with the baby over her shoulder. She literally threw him to me. ‘We had the baby on the kitchen floor. She said he’d had a fit, she didn’t tell us he was in the bath. His lips were blue, his eyes were slightly open and we were pumping his chest and doing mouth-to-mouth. ‘It was only later we saw the bath and it was full to the overflow.’ As panic ensued, Alfie remained in the bath, and it was another neighbour who scooped the boy from the water. When emergency services arrived one ambulance crew member was left so distressed by the screaming Reeves that she said: ‘I couldn’t work out if she was distressed, shocked or just plain horrible.’ Tellingly, the response of Reeves’s brother when he arrived at the hospital was: ‘Was she p*****?’ Another resident of the flats claimed social services had been told of the mother’s cannabis smoking. So what of Reeves now? Her mother Dawn had a sharp retort when approached by a Mail reporter. ‘Do one,’ she said, giving some insight into where her daughter got her unpleasant tongue. Meanwhile back in Redhill, Aneesa Shukkore, who has lived in Reeves’s three-storey block for 22 years, told the Mail: ‘I will never forget that day. The ambulance came and she [Reeves] looked up at me and said, “It’s all your fault”. ‘I don’t know why she said it. But the policeman who came said to me, “Don’t worry, she just wanted to blame somebody”. ’","Mother Danielle Reeves from Caterham, Surrey, left sons Frankie-Joe, 12 months, and Alfie, now three, alone in a bath for up to 50 minutes .

"It's been a crazy few months since I last checked in on my Road to Rio. The Commonwealth Games were incredible. I wasn't selected for 3 metre individual despite making all the pre-requisites and retaining a spot in the top two for England. I really fancied my chances at a medal here, especially after a strong performance at the Olympics back in 2012, but for some reason they decided to put in for another event. I was selected for the 1 metre, which isn't what I usually do, but blessed with the opportunity to compete I gave it my best shot. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Chris Mears discussing the release of his new single . Chris Mears (right) poses with Jack Laugher (left) after winning gold at the Commonwealth Games in Glasgow . Laugher (left) and Mears (right) dive in the synchronised 3 metre springboard final at the Games in August . The event I was most looking forward to was the 3 metre synchronised with my new partner Jack Laugher. We now live and train together in Leeds and we had the determination and the belief that we'd be on that medal podium - and it paid off. My family, my girlfriend, management the team were there, and it felt great having England behind me. After narrowly missing out on a medal at the Delhi Commonwealths, it was insane to walk away with a gold medal this time round. The end of August is always downtime. A bit like our summer holidays. It's five weeks where we can do what we want, eat what we want and we usually keep as far away from water as possible. I took this time to really push my music. I had a couple of gigs across the UK, including one in London which some of the team came along to watch, and then I headed out to Ibiza with a few of my best mates. I'd always wanted to experience the music scene out there. I had the opportunity to watch Avicii and a few other huge influences and generally just chill out.

Find out where your money goes at www.lotterygoodcauses.org.uk . I teamed up with the guys at Corona Sunsets too. They hosted an incredible evening of live music, cocktails on the beach and it was so nice to meet some of my music heroes. After that, I headed out to Mexico. Diving is a massive sport out there and a large number of my followers on social media are out there, so with a few DJ sets booked across the country we headed out on a tour. First stop was Cancun. Insane white beaches and beautiful weather - it reminded me a bit of Miami. We then headed down the coast to Playa Del Carmen. Here we visited a theme park called Xcaret. The park is essentially a beginners guide to Mexico all in one park. Beautiful wildlife roams the park. Shows and spectacles, underwater natural rivers you can swim in, shark encounters, beaches and museums. It had the lot. If you're ever in the south of Mexico it's a must! The rest of the trip was an amalgamation of gigs, press and media, orchestrated by the record label I'm working with - Universal Music. We spent a lot of time in Mexico City, where I collaborated with the British Embassy on a project to promote the relationship between the UK and Mexico in culture, sports and music. I also had the first radio play of my debut single, hung out with some fans, ate an awful lot of Mexican food and drunk a little bit of Tequila too. My favourite place was a beautiful city called Zacatecas. We then flew on to Los Angeles. I'd heard loads about it, but knew within about five minutes of being out of the airport that I would live there some day. Mears poses at Xcaret theme park in Mexico in a picture posted to his official Twitter account . There's such an incredible buzz about it, beautiful weather, an amazing sports and music scene and I met some great new friends. Since then it's been a bit of a reality check. Back to hard work. As you can imagine the first few days back at training hurt so much but I've got a new weights plan, Jack and I are learning some new dives and I have some new focus for my individual work. We're really starting to look ahead to Rio now that the Commonwealths have been and gone. Preparation for next year's season is well underway too. There's plenty of travelling involved, which is made possible by National Lottery funding. It's tiring but an insane experience to share with the team. Away from the pool, awesome things are happening with my music and I can't wait for you to hear some of my stuff in the coming months.","Chris Mears won gold in the 3m synchronised diving at the Commonwealth Games in Glasgow .

"It was only when I arrived in Jamaica with my girlfriend at the end of last year that I realised how tired I was. What a year! After World Championship silver, two medals in the European Championships and my five medals in the Commonwealth Games, what more could I ask for? It was great to round the year off with a fantastic holiday. Then, of course, there was Christmas. Thankfully, it wasn’t during competition period so I could eat as much turkey and stuffing as I wanted… within reason. I've also been involved in some exciting events with my sponsors, who – like the National Lottery – have supported me a lot in my career. Now, though, with the English and British Championships coming up next month, the hard work starts here. I’m back in training, mostly working on new skills and stamina before I build up to routine work. It’s hard work and long hours, but I enjoy it. Plus, it’s essential if I’m going to beat my personal all-around best of 90.6 next month. Max Whitlock competes in the Men's Pommel Horse Final at the 2014 Commonwealth Games in Glasgow . Whitlock with his World Championships silver medal, finishing behind Kohei Uchimura of Japan . Getting to and from the gym is a lot more convenient since I moved to Basildon late last year – now it’s just a 10-minute drive, rather than an hour’s commute. I’m not quite an Essex boy just yet, though - still Hemel at heart! The English and British Championships will be a great chance for me to test out some new routines. I’m feeling good about them at the moment, but I’ve still got a lot of work to do in the next few weeks. Hopefully I can pull it off. I had a mixed time in my last competition – the World Championships in October. I had trouble at the beginning, and I think it was down to my mindset – I was taking it too seriously, rather than looking to enjoy the experience. I think, after having such a great year, I was putting to much emphasis on rounding it off as well as possible. It was probably the steepest learning curve I’ve had in my career so far. Luckily, I got a second chance and refocused for the final to pick up a silver medal. But more importantly, it taught me a valuable lesson for the future.

"I’ve just got back from a training camp in Rio and it was such an amazing trip. I’d never been and had seen a lot of films about Brazil and Rio. Despite all of the things you hear about the favelas and the dangerous side of things, it had such a good vibe. Everyone there seems to be health and fitness crazy. At every bus stop or by the beach, almost at every point you could see, there was an outside gym or a frame to work out on. So there were people all over the place getting jacked up or doing chin ups and it was really cool. I’ve never seen anything like it. It was a perfectly balanced trip for us, which was really good. We’re just going into that competition phase and normally we train at home but to go out there really helped mix it up. It keeps you fresh and it’s good to be with the team as we enjoy spending time with each other. Chris Mears marks his departure for Rio de Janeiro for a Team GB diving training camp with a selfie . Mears says going to Rio was was a perfectly balanced trip for the team usually spread around the UK . Without National Lottery funding, we wouldn’t be able to go out and do trips like this. Of course we get the chance to enjoy ourselves and get refreshed, but it’s also such a great opportunity to do some really good work before all the exciting things ahead. We got a lot of serious training done and when Alexei Evangulov, our performance director, decided to go to Rio, it was partly because they have one of the best gym facilities in the world. To have that was a really big part of going there. But we were also based just over the road from the beach so it only took us about 10 seconds to get there – Alexei definitely got that one right! It was great to do the tourist thing but in a way it gets that excitement out of the way for the next time we go. Hopefully then we will all be in serious competition mode. Health-wise it also helps us boost our vitamin D with all the sunshine. That gets low in the winter so there’s no better way to top that up than spend some time in Rio! Unfortunately we couldn’t eat street food because, with strict drug testing, we have to know what goes in our bodies, but the food at the hotel was incredible. There was so much rich, vibrant fruit, which was great, but going out to eat was tough. None of us speak Portuguese and there wasn’t much English spoken, so when Jack Laugher and I were free, we tried to book a table but the people at the restaurant had no idea what we were on about! It was great to enjoy moments like that and I think we are the closest knit team in Team GB. A lot of training programmes train together 24/7 but we’re scattered all over the country. There’s a bunch of us in Leeds, Plymouth and London so when we come together it’s such a good laugh. Going to see Christ the Redeemer was phenomenal. It’s hard to explain how good it was. It wasn’t just the statue, it was that stunning view for miles around. Luckily you can get a coach up to the top – we didn’t have to run up there for extra training! It was great to go to the beach too and the waves were huge, so that was a lot of fun. With team-mate Jack Laugher, Mears says their lack of Portuguese made it tricky to dine out in Rio .

Mears was blown away by Rio's famous Christ the Redeemer statue and 'the stunning view for miles around' The Team GB divers get along brilliantly, says Mears, so enjoyed each other's company in Rio . It’s also a very exciting time for me right now because my first single is finally coming out. I’ve got a music deal with Universal and I’ve been working so hard to reach this stage and now for it to be released is crazy. I’m moving in with Jack in March and will hopefully get to set up a bit of a studio to work in between training. As divers we have quite a big fan base in Mexico for some reason so I recently went there to do a bit of a tour and do some DJ sets. So the first single is actually called ‘Mexico’ and is dropping there first! So it’s been a busy few weeks but all exciting stuff. The trip to Rio was a small but significant step towards reaching our Olympic dreams and it really whet our appetite. To stand there on the boards and see the Olympic rings already up in the stadium, we were all thinking: ‘Yep, this is going to be good.’ As well as funding the Road to Rio athletes, every week National Lottery players raise over £33 million for arts, heritage, charity, community projects and grass roots sports clubs and facilities.

"You can never tell or prove someone is racist unless they actually say or show you. That’s what I’ve always believed. On Tuesday in Paris one group of bullying Chelsea supporters screamed and shouted and showed how racist they were. Seeing and hearing these cowards chanting ‘We’re racist! We’re racist!’ to one lonesome black guy made my blood boil. All I kept thinking was: I hope these guys get some payback. Michael Duberry played over 100 games for Chelsea in his six years at the club in the mid 1990s . 'I never played in front of racist Chelsea fans...That Chelsea was dead and buried decades ago' Gary Lineker, presenter and ex footballer: 'Just saw the video of the Chelsea mob's deplorable behaviour and racist chants. Sickening, embarrassing, moronic, disgraceful.' Paul Canoville, Chelsea's first ever black footballer: 'I watched it and I was in disgust, I was so angry and ashamed. We’ve done so much campaigning against the very issue of racism and this happens and it’s brought it all right back down. I don’t care if it’s the minority because regardless of that it is connected to the club and when you mention Chelsea this will be the response. I can’t believe this has come about.' Stan Collymore, pundit and ex footballer: 'Chelsea fans. Save your spite for those on the train, I'm sure you'll want to see them banned from holding season tickets at your club.' Jason Roberts, pundit and ex footballer: 'I hope that every black Chelsea Player watches that.' Sepp Blatter, FIFA president: 'I also condemn the actions of a small group of Chelsea fans in Paris. There is no place for racism in football.' Ian Wright, pundit and ex footballer: 'Chelsea what you gonna do? Your club has been linked to racism for so long! What have you done? Put a couple of signs up in your ground? Those guys on the train remind me of my childhood. Chase you with their mates! But when alone and confronted, I've seen them cry.' I was disgusted to see such behaviour. It was like I was going back in time and watching a documentary about the old Chelsea fans; the old Chelsea fans that were racist, the Chelsea fans that used to give their own players racist abuse. It was always difficult to picture the Chelsea fans I played for being the same racist Chelsea fans who gave their own players Paul Canoville and Keith Dublin such grief and abuse. I never played in front of racist Chelsea fans at Stamford Bridge or anywhere when I wore the Chelsea shirt. That old racist Chelsea was before my time. That Chelsea was dead and buried decades ago. The club has done all it can to kill that image and now it is very much a multicultural club. But maybe this is something that Roman Abramovich’s millions can’t buy. I kept thinking to myself: how do the minds of these racist guys work? A few hours later these same men were cheering on their Chelsea team, with two black guys in the starting line-up - Willian and Ramires. Did they cheer for them? Or did they get angry that these two were wearing the Chelsea shirt? Did these same racist idiots not cheer with the rest of the Chelsea fans when Didier Drogba scored that penalty in Munich? Was the club’s greatest triumph tarnished because a black man scored the winning goal? Did these fans used to hate me as a black man wearing the blue of Chelsea? Only they can answer those questions. I can’t even begin to try to translate the thought process of a racist. A black fan attempts to board a train but is refused entry by fans travelling to the Champions League tie . The amateur footage goes on to show passengers in the carriage following the disgraceful incident . Honestly, I find it all disgusting and hope they all get locked away. Extreme, I know, but surely let’s make an example of them — of racists. Chelsea, the FA, FIFA and any other footballing governing body need to come up with a plan to eliminate these thugs from our game and society. Not just a poster campaign, or wristbands or even a fancy advert, but a proper campaign with proper consequences and proper punishment for those guilty. Chelsea need to clean up their own house with these fans and do their own in-house justice to make sure they are identified and make the punishment radical. Disassociation alone is not enough — there has to be a huge message for all to see. Duberry (right) celebrates with Dennis Wise and Gus Poyet after a Chelsea goal at Stamford Bridge . Duberry holds off Dennis Bergkamp during his six-year career at Chelsea, and has been a fan ever since . I know those cowards do not represent all Chelsea fans but unfortunately they did in Paris and brought shame on the club. Chelsea are my team and have been ever since I signed as a schoolboy more than 25 years ago, so I feel the highs and lows like all Chelsea supporters. I will defend them in debates about everything but what happened on Tuesday in Paris was indefensible. I didn’t even try to. In many discussions I heard in the aftermath there was talk I should be ashamed to be a Chelsea fan. I’m not ashamed to be a Chelsea fan and I am not ashamed over what happened in Paris as those racist idiots do not represent ME but I am very saddened at what those mindless idiots have done to the image of my Chelsea.

"For a sport reliant on perfect timing, it could be the gymnastics schedule at the Commonwealth Games that proves the toughest test of all. England’s Max Whitlock, one of Sportsmail’s seven athletes on the Road to Rio, is targeting success across the board in Glasgow but, if all goes to plan, he will have to compete on five straight days this week. ‘We’ve never been in a competition like it,’ says the 21-year-old.

Thanks to my National Lottery funding, we also went to a training camp in Portugal.’ It’s not just a physical challenge — the programme will test the gymnasts’ mental strength in other ways. ‘The team final is usually competed over one day, but here it will be over two,’ says Whitlock.

"I’ve been at home in Halifax in West Yorkshire for Christmas, which is a rare two weeks in the UK for me. For six months of the year I live in Spain, playing for a wheelchair basketball team over there. It’s good to be back and see family and have some home comforts but after a week I’m raring to get back to training. I live in a town called Albacete, which is about 160 miles south of Madrid, and play for their local team. It’s obviously winter now so the weather isn’t the greatest but it’s still much warmer than home. It’s inland so we have to travel on a train or bus to get to the beach but I love living in a new place. I’m learning a new culture and different customs, which is just another bonus of playing sport at this level. Harry Brown has revealed he is ready to get back into training again after a rare week off . Wheelchair basketball player Brown, who resides in Spain, spent his Christmas in England . Where I am it is very Spanish, and removed from tourist resorts. With it being such a little town there’s not any big brands or supermarkets. It’s all little local businesses and I buy my food from a butchers and grocers which is quite nice. The atmosphere is a bit more relaxed, things happen when they happen, there’s no rush. As nice as it is to live abroad, the main reason I’m here is to develop my skills on the court. It was back in the summer of 2013 that one of the Spanish national team players approached me while I was at a tournament and asked if I’d consider playing in their domestic league. All the clubs in Spain get sponsored through the football clubs or the council so I can just focus on basketball rather than behind the scenes things like jobs and money. There’s good international competition out here, I’m playing against Spanish and Italian players, a real mixture of players with different performance levels. At home I’m always used to playing against the same person and it gets a bit stale, there’s little opportunity to improve. In Spain, I’m constantly being tested in training and in games. My team consists of five English players, three Mexicans and another five Spaniards. The coach speaks Spanish and English and most of the team speak good enough English. I’m doing two lessons of Spanish a week. I’m picking it up quite quickly in terms of understanding but the speaking is much more difficult. There was problems with my housing when I first got out to Spain so I was living with one of the other English guys but now I’m living on my own. They either gave us accommodation or offered us money to find an apartment so I’ve put money towards getting a slightly bigger place so when my family come to stay I can put them up rather than them having to stay in a hotel. One thing that’s been really good in this team is that there are no big egos, we all go out for coffee or shopping together. It’s great to get back in the Great Britain set up, too. I was part of the team that won the European Championship in Frankfurt in 2013. Brown is one of our Road to Rio 2016 stars along with Sally Brown, Chris Mears, Adam Gemili, Katarina Johnson-Thompson, Rebecca James and Max Whitlock (left to right) Brown is looking forward to representing Great Britain at the 2016 Paralympics Games in Brazil . That was huge for our confidence levels. Knowing that we’ve won senior Europeans twice (after winning in Israel in 2011). We have to keep our feet on the ground but there is that element of thinking, can anyone beat us? There’s always a chance of getting carried away but we all know there’s a bigger goal, we’ve got to carry that win over and make Rio in 2016 a bigger win. The World Championships in Incheon, South Korea in July this year was a bit of a reality check. We finished seventh overall and were definitely expecting more than that. We went through the group stages undefeated so we were very confident but got beaten in the first knockout round. That gives me the drive not to let it happen again. After South Korea we all had a two-week break and then did an orientation camp in Rio. We had one evening where we went up to the Christ the Redeemer, which was pretty epic. Our tour guide, who was a local bus driver, took us around the Olympic Park but we weren’t allowed access to any venues but it all looked like it was taking shape. Seeing everything made it feel a little bit more real. It dawned upon me that in less than two years we should be inside those buildings playing for a gold medal with the best in the world on show. I really believe we can win gold if everything keeps going on the same trajectory.

"Job done! It wasn’t a classic performance but six tries and a 30-point winning margin is what I was hoping for and England just about delivered against an Italy team that ‘turned up’ and made life difficult at times. Certainly compared with their scrappy 18-11 win over Italy two seasons ago this was an improvement . Time now to move on very quickly because England will need to find another level of precision altogether if they are to beat Ireland in Dublin, which looks like being the pivotal game in this year’s Six Nations. The good was there for all to see from England. Jonathan Joseph is on fire, has the confidence to try things from long range and was very good value for his two tries and rightly takes man-of-the-match honours. England head coach Stuart Lancaster congratulates Jonathan Joseph (left) on his man of the match display . Joseph scored two tries as England run riot in the second half against Italy to win 47-17 . Joseph (right) is congratulated after scoring his second try of the game  in a man of the match performance . Jonathan Joseph: The Bath man is in form, so much so that he took the reorganising of the England back line in his stride, whereas a year ago that might have fazed him. His first try for England was a big moment, settling the side’s nerves at a key time. OK, Italy’s tackling wasn’t fantastic but Joseph can be a hard man to lay a hand on when he is in this mood. His second try underlined his understanding with George Ford, who put him into space at speed. After that it was just a sprint for home. Anthony Watson built on his excellent performance in Cardiff and not only continues to look good in attack but made some very good tackles in the second half. These two are nailed on now in this developing England back line. George Ford ticked over nicely but it was also well worthwhile giving Danny Cipriani some game time. He didn’t disappoint. Big-match player that he is, Cipriani took less than a minute to ghost in for a try and looked almost apologetic after he touched down as if he didn’t want to gatecrash the party and upset anybody. He shouldn’t worry on that score. Look at the tape. He worked hard for that try. He saw something was on down the left, found Jonny May early with the pass and then showed good pace and anticipation to track May along the touchline and take up the perfect position for the return pass. It was a deceptively difficult and classy try and he will feel much more part of things after that. I suspect Nick Easter will also have enjoyed his rumble over for a try as well and he definitely made an impact when coming on. Anthony Watson (centre) has another fine game for England on the wing as they beat Italy . Danny Cipriani came off the bench in the second half and made an immediate impact by scoring a try . There were some passages of play I didn’t enjoy quite so much, though. England are developing a bad habit of getting out of the blocks slowly and their approach was altogether too sloppy in the first five minutes. They passed the ball along the line without any intent instead of hoofing down the pitch and they coughed up a turnover at their first line-out which put Italy on the attack and led eventually to the Italians’ early try. Their rearrangement after Mike Brown’s injury confused me a little, although it did seem to settle down in the second half. The obvious thing to do was bring on Cipriani at full back or move Watson to full back and ask Cipriani or Billy Twelvetrees to play on the wing. Instead, what seemed to happen is that Watson moved to full back, Twelvetrees went to 12, Burrell went to 13 and Joseph found himself on the wing. What England effectively ended up doing was making four changes when they could have rejigged after the injury with just one or two.

"Adam Gemili, Max Whitlock and Sally Brown look frightened. The trio have competed and won medals against the best athletes in the world, in front of hundreds of thousands and, at times, even millions. Put three easels, a handful of charcoal, a plethora of paints and a mildly eccentric artist in front of them and their combined years of training counts for very little. ‘I’m the least artistic person ever,’ sprinter Gemili makes clear at the start. ‘I feel nervous,’ adds gymnast Whitlock, who won three golds at the Commonwealth Games this year. Chris Mears, Adam Gemili, Sally Brown and Max Whitlock stand in front of their artwork . The four Road to Rio stars paint pictures of themselves in action after a lesson from artist Rachel Gadsen . Brown, a Paralympic 100m and 400m sprinter, is speechless. They do not have long to learn, as three of Sportsmail’s Road to Rio athletes meet for an afternoon art lesson. ‘The more you let go, the better it will be,’ artist Rachel Gadsden explains. She makes some broad charcoal marks on her page and briefly gives them some tips, before it is their turn. Gadsden gets down on to her hands and knees and tells the others to draw her in the starting blocks pose, capturing her movement as she slowly rises to her feet. They start drawing. Gadsden begins to move up slowly. ‘Energy, energy, energy,’ she barks at them. The athletes, funded by the National Lottery, have to keep drawing shapes on top of shapes. There are confused looks from the frantically scribbling trio. After 15 minutes, they stop to reflect. ‘Take a step back and take a look,’ Gadsden says. Whitlock steps back and flashes a huge grin to the small gathering of onlookers in the Whitechapel Gallery. The artist goes over to his work. ‘Where are your arms?’ she asks. ‘I forgot them!’ he replies, adding: ‘I mucked that leg up.’ ‘It doesn’t matter, you’re artists not athletes today,’ Gadsden says. Tissues in hand, as they’ve been instructed, the athletes work away — smudging and drawing — and finish their pieces. They are surprisingly good, but this is just the warm-up. There is a short break and diver Chris Mears turns up, explaining he is late due to losing his car keys and wallet and having to get a train instead. He is just in time for the main event, however, and does not hesitate to dive right in. Gadsen gives the Olympians a lesson in drawing at the Whitechapel gallery in London . Brown, Mears, Whitlock and Gemili pose for a picture with Gadsen . The foursome have half an hour to capture themselves in action, using charcoal on canvas then going for it with the paint on top. Plates of gold, black, red and blue splurges are brought out. ‘Remember the paint can go outside the figure,’ Gadsden explains. ‘It increases the energy.’ The athletes are deep in concentration, with the sort of focus they reserve for when they are competing for gold. ‘You’ve got five minutes to speed up, you’re all good at that,’ Gadsden barks again. Then time is up. Hands are dripping with paint and dirty with charcoal. Brown wipes sweat from her brow. They have crossed the finish line, completed the complex gymnastics routine and pulled off that difficult dive. The results are strong and vibrant pieces of artwork. All of them have finished with gold — and black and red and blue. They are covered in it. Gemili and Whitlock won medals at the 2014 Commonwealth Games in Glasgow during the summer .

"A protester so aghast with Silicon Valley's impact on the Bay Area has gone as far as to vomit on a Yahoo shuttle bus. The mystery demonstrator was among a group of protesters picketing the buses that ferry employees of the big tech corporations to work, deeming them indicative of everything wrong with the hyper-gentrified Silicon Valley. On Tuesday, the group blocked an intersection in San Francisco's Mission area, and protestors consisted of dancers in clown suit onesies. But Valleywag.com reported that in Oakland, almost 50 'rebels' blocked a pick up zone for tech buses and one apparently vomited on the windshield of a Yahoo bus from its roof. Scroll down for video .

A disturbing picture shows the sick, which supposedly was hurled on cue. The action reportedly delayed shuttle buses from Apple bus, Google bus and Yahoo bus for more than half an hour. Oakland police and Bay Area Rapid Transit officers 'pushed the demonstrators off the street.'

"The road to success for athletes is rarely a straightforward one. None more so than in the case of Paralympic sprinter Sally Brown, who is still aiming for glory in Rio 2016 despite an injury-ravaged past three years. The 19-year-old is taking an unconventional route to the top, picking up a part-time job in a supermarket to help make ends meet. While her contemporaries are focusing everything on training to get into peak condition, she is juggling athletics with working 12 hours per week in Sainsbury’s. VIDEO Scroll down to see Sally Brown answer your Christmas questions . Brown is targeting success at the 2016 Paralympic games in Rio but has a number of obstacles to overcome . Injuries have led to her losing her funding, meaning she has got a part-time job at a supermarket . Sportsmail is following the progress of seven athletes on the path to Rio 2016 . From struggling with foot injuries to having her appendix out last year, Brown has been left frustrated and unable to compete with any consistency. It has cost her the funding to train and race. Brown had not competed enough to warrant funding last season and was just returning from injury and ready to get back on it this year when it was reallocated in November, only for stress fractures in her feet to rule her out again. She had dipped into savings to fund her past year, training in Loughborough and completing AS Levels in photography and art. But that money soon dried up. ‘I needed to get a job after the summer, I realised when I pulled out of the European Championships there was no chance of getting back on the funding,’ said Brown (left). ‘I had to run a fast time, which I was planning on doing at the Europeans. If my feet hadn’t played up I was confident of doing that. ‘I knew it wasn’t going to happen. I sat down with my parents and figured out what I was going to do. They’re not rich, so they didn’t have money to help me. So I got a job in Sainsbury’s. They’ve been really good. I told them I was an athlete and they said I can work when I want.’ Running is all Brown has ever known and all she ever wanted to do, but, for this year at least, while rehabilitating from her latest injury then training hard to hone her technique in the 100m and 400m, she will also have to stack shelves and man tills. Brown is determined not to let her loss of funding hold her back from competing in Rio . Brown (centre) pictured competing in the T46 heats of the 200m Women's Paralympics in London 2012 . ‘I was really nervous before my first shift, I was terrified,’ she admitted. ‘I’ve never had a job before because I’ve always just run. Last year I had all my funding saved, but all that saving was gone. ‘If I get back on it — when I get back on it — I’ll be more grateful for it. The next opportunity will be November next year, so I’ve got a year to get through.’ Brown is not letting this latest in a long line of setbacks stand in the way of her ambition to race and win medals at the 2016 Rio Olympics. She remains confident of being able to compete at the highest level, provided she can finally get fit and then stay fit. But she is doing it the hard way. ‘It’s really difficult,’ she added. ‘At this point it’s when I’d need funding the most with all the rehab.’ Brown (left) has moved in with her boyfriend, T44 100m London gold medal winner Jonnie Peacock (right) Brown is being helped through it all by boyfriend Jonnie Peacock — the T44 100m London Paralympic gold medal winner — and by their new puppy. In September the pair moved in together in a terraced house just outside Loughborough, where they train, and added a third member to their family. ‘We got a little puppy called Luna,’ said Brown. ‘She’s a French bulldog. I’ve grown up and always had dogs. ‘We don’t talk about athletics at home! I love running and athletics but it’s the last thing we want to talk about when we get home from training.’ Money raised by National Lottery players has been changing lives for 20 years. £32 billion has gone to sport, the arts, charities and heritage projects across the UK.

"We’ve just had the draw for the European Championships this summer and it’s exciting to think that the tournament will be staged on home soil in Worcester. We’ve won the tournament the last two times – in 2011 and 2013 – so it would be a really special achievement to win a hat-trick on our own patch. Traditionally the hosts get to pick which group they go into, and we are now in Pool A with Poland, Spain, Czech Republic, France and Germany. The way it’s worked means we have a slightly harder group but it could potentially be easier in the next stage. In Pool B it’s Holland, Turkey, Israel, Switzerland, Sweden and Italy, so it must have been a tough decision for the coaches. Harry Brown set to represent Great Britain in this summer's European Wheelchair Basketball Championships . Team GB have won the last two tournaments in 2011 and 2013, and 2015 is being hosted in Worcester . Our group will be tough, though. Germany are a good side and probably the team to watch out for, but with them you can catch them in different form throughout the tournament. They often start strong but then tend to drop off a little bit towards the end. We might be able to play them before the tournament to gauge how they are. France are another enigma – they came second in the Worlds in 2010 and then bottom of the Europeans the next year and went down a division. But they’ve worked their way back up and could be tricky. Spain are like Germany and can be the best team in the world or implode, but we always seem to play well against them so I think we’ll be OK. As for Poland, they have got weaker over the past few years and the Czech Republic, I won’t lie, I’ve never seen them play! That’ s because they’ve not been in the top division for a while but we’ll have to be wary of them. I think we’ll definitely qualify for the knockouts as four from each group go through, but all it takes is for the other teams to show up and it could be tough. But wheelchair basketball is always difficult to predict. You never know what the others are going to do. Having missed out on London 2012, this is my first senior major on home soil, so I’m very excited by it. I’m playing in the league in Spain right now so it hasn’t really sunk in yet. But come April or May I’ll suddenly think: ‘Ooh, this is going to be good.’ In terms of support, my mum has hired a little studio apartment for the duration and a few others will come down so hopefully there’ll be plenty of noise from my end. But as far as I’m aware, she has this one-bed place but eight or 10 of them want to stay down there. It will be a tight squeeze. Brown currently play for a club in Albacete, Spain called Amiab . Brown (far left) is one of seven athletes Sportsmail are following on the Road to Rio 2016 . I’m still only 20 but it’s nice to be a more experience member of the GB squad now. I was at the European Juniors last year and a few of those players are now in the seniors and because they know me they feel they can come to me and ask questions. So that’s good for some new youngsters to be coming through and for us all to know each other and get on well. We have a GB training camp coming up in the next few weeks and that will be a good chance for us all to meet up. We’re off to Italy, somewhere near Milan, and we’re lucky that National Lottery funding helps us with those kind of camps. They’re always so vital for us to train and practise together. For me personally I’m enjoying my second season playing for Amiab in the Spanish league. We’re based in Albacete, which is quite a remote city. There’s hardly any tourism or anything like that, but it makes it easier to focus on wheelchair basketball. As for my Spanish, it’s getting there. I’m quite good at understanding it now but speaking isn't so good. We have a translator on our team who comes to games as well just in case… Sometimes when it comes down to it you tend to forget your tenses and things like that. There’s five other Brits in my team so it’s nice to hang out together. We have our own places but three of us are all within about 100 yards of each other so that’s perfect. As well as funding the Road to Rio athletes, every week National Lottery players raise over £33 million for arts, heritage, charity, community projects and grass roots sports clubs and facilities.

"I met Jamal Edwards, the founder of SB.TV, recently when we both visited my old college to talk to the students there. I was invited back to Barking and Dagenham College for their awards presentation and they had Jamal there because he's someone who has made a career, made a whole company, from just him and a camera. He gave a great speech about where he's come from and what he's doing. One line stood out for me. He related a career to athletics, saying; 'Just focus on your own lane, don't worry about what anyone else is doing, what any other athletes are doing or anything else that is going on. Just focus on your own training, your own race, and you'll get the results you deserve.' We hung out a little bit afterwards. He's a really easy guy to chat to – he's just normal – he's just a normal guy with a great business idea and he's gone and developed that and made something huge. Adam Gemili crosses the line ahead of Germany's Lucas Jukubczyk during the European Championships . When I played at Dagenham they put us in that college so I stayed there for two years. They've always been very supportive of me. I did a Q&A about how the summer went and how my career is going. I tried to get across that it's all about patience, people develop at different rates, no matter what you're doing keep concentrating on yourself and you'll get there if you work hard and you'll reach your goals. I thought the students might be shy but they were asking me loads of questions and for advice. Part of why I'm doing what I'm doing is to try to talk to younger guys and try to inspire them to do what they want to do. Not just in sport, in terms of music or politics or art. The sprinter helped Britain win the gold medal in the 4x100m relay race in Zurich, Switzerland . I want to be a good role model and lead by example. If I can do that, then I'm happy doing what I'm doing. I got back into training at the start of October time, trying to get my body back in shape, and it's coming together well. At some point I'll arrange a race with Jamal. Everyone who I meet always wants to race me. Everyone thinks they're quick and could beat me. It's only a bit of fun. My reaction: you're more than welcome to try. Gemili celebrates victory with Richard Kilty, Harry Aikines-Aryeetey and James Ellington .

"Mark Selby lifted his first major trophy since the World Championship in May as he beat Shaun Murphy in a gripping German Masters final. The Leicester potter, who takes the world No 1 ranking on the back of his 9-7 triumph over Murphy, emerged brilliantly from a recent slump to take the glory in Berlin. He fell early in both December's UK Championship and January's Masters at Alexandra Palace, but Selby was back to his best to fend off close friend Murphy. Mark Selby got his hands on his first trophy since May last year by winning the German Masters . Selby overcam Shaun Murphy in the final to record a 9-7 victory and take the world No 1 ranking . He trailed 5-2 early on but took the final frame of the afternoon session to close the gap, and reeled off four in a row at the start of the evening to transform the contest. Murphy had ploughed in breaks of 130 and 118 in an afternoon purple patch, but the sharp potting that saw him carry off the Masters in London last month was then absent at key moments. And Selby, who had breaks of 92 and 93 during his early-evening flurry of frames, took advantage to carry off the title and prize money of £60,000. Selby was competing in pool in China last week, finishing runner-up in the eight-ball World Championship. He said of his latest snooker success: 'I'm really proud of myself. To get out of the (afternoon) session at 5-3 I knew I was still in the match. At 6-2 I possibly couldn't have won. 'But I played well tonight, to start off the session. Selby has also returned to the top of the world rankings as a result of his victory in Germany . 'Winning the World Championship last year did put a lot of weight on my shoulders. Going into every tournament I have felt a lot more pressure. But coming here, it's fantastic to get a win under my belt this season. It's nice to get one out of the way. 'Being back to number one is a good feeling.' Murphy said on British Eurosport: 'Losing the first four frames tonight wasn't in my script but the guy is world champion and he's a credit to our sport. We're lucky to have him.'","Mark Selby had not won a trophy since the World Championship last May .

"It's pretty crazy for me to be named with the other sports stars for the Sports Personality of the Year award. I found out when my management company rang me. It felt amazing then but it didn't really sink in until the official announcement. You've got to look at Lewis Hamilton and Rory McIlroy as favourites – their backing is massive. I'm just happy to be in the top 10, it's a great thing for me and for British athletics. When I read through all the massive names on the list it feels unreal. I still consider myself young and that it's early on in my career, so to be recognised this year is amazing. It's a massive confidence boost. It will push me on into next year.

I've been off on holiday and spent 11 nights in Jamaica with my girlfriend. I was starting to feel pretty tired and needed a rest. I spend six or seven hours in the gym every day, about 35 hours per week. I love it and it's definitely worth it, but it's tiring. I pretty much stay in the gym the whole year round. I even have to maintain it while I'm on holiday. When I was younger and went away if I didn't do anything I'd get back in the gym and it would take two weeks to get back into it because my wrists were sore. So I do little bits every day, every morning, to maintain it. My brother made me some mini bars and I do bodyweight training on them for about 45 minutes a day.

"Read Vernon Kay's preview here . Ahead of Super Bowl XLIX on Sunday night between the New England Patriots and Seattle Seahawks, Vernon Kay reflects on some of his favourite memories from the showpiece event. 3. New York Giants 39-20 Denver Broncos - Super Bowl XXI, January 25, 1987 . This was the year I really got into American football and I knew the rules and what to look out for. The sun setting over the iconic Rose Bowl in California made the whole event look beautiful. I remember watching up to the end of the first quarter and had school the next morning. But my mum stayed up and recorded the game on VHS but paused the adverts, because if you didn’t pause the adverts you wouldn’t get the whole game on one tape. That Super Bowl started a period of about 10 years where my mum or dad would pause the adverts to get it all on a VHS video. In that game we saw John Elway and Lawrence Taylor and two iconic teams. That’s one Super Bowl I remember for it’s visual beauty. The iconic Rose Bowl in Pasadena, California on the day of Super Bowl XX in 1987 .

Pittsburgh Steelers 27-23 Arizona Cardinals - Super Bowl XLIII, February 1, 2009 . This was the first Super Bowl I watched live and I was fortunate enough to be sat just over the end zone when Ben Roethlisberger threw the final touchdown to win the game for the Steelers. Little did I know that the wide receivers coach for the London Warriors, Marvin Allen, was on that squad and he won a Super Bowl ring in that game. Santonio Holmes celebrates catching the game-winning touchdown for the Pittsburgh Steelers in 2009 . 1. Chicago Bears 46-10 New England Patriots - Super Bowl XX, January 26, 1986 . This was the first American game that I ever saw. It was one of the best defenses that had ever played the game. I wasn’t aware at the time, but as I slowly taught myself about the history of the game, I realised that Bears defense was one of the best to play the game. It was also the first time I saw Walter Payton run the football and they had William Perry aka 'The Fridge'. That was the season that made him a household name, even in Britain.

"Jenson Button claims he has 'unfinished business' with Honda and is of the firm belief they will emerge as Formula One frontrunners. McLaren have again reunited themselves with Honda from this season, with the Japanese manufacturing giant serving as power-unit supplier, 23 years after the pair last formed a powerful alliance. For Button, it was only seven years ago he last worked with Honda when they were a fully-fledged team, albeit one that succumbed to the global credit crisis at the end of 2008 as they were forced to withdraw from F1. British Formula One driver Jenson Button of McLaren Honda steers his MP4-30 . Button takes his McLaren Honda MP4-30 for a spin during testing in Jerez Spain . Jenson Button claims he has 'unfinished business' with Honda who have teamed up with McLaren . Ross Brawn went on to resurrect the marque from the ashes, forming Brawn GP which astonishingly helped Button become drivers' champion in 2009, as well claiming the constructors' crown. Button is fully aware of Honda's desire to prove themselves again in F1, as they did with McLaren from 1988-1991 when they were virtually unbeatable. 'We didn't get the results together in '07 and '08, so there's a lot for us to achieve, and to put right if you like, of working together,' assessed Button. Honda and McLaren last worked together 23 years ago and Button wants to get the results that count . 'We did obviously have some good times, like in 2006 with our win in Hungary, and at other times we had some very special moments. 'Now we need to build on that, but yes, there is also a lot of unfinished business.' It was no surprise Honda encountered numerous difficulties during last week's first pre-season test, completing just six laps on each of the first two days, and 79 over the four in total. Button, though, has every confidence Honda will not struggle for long given the diligent way they go about their business. 'I like their philosophy, the way they go racing,' said Button. Button tests the corners of his new McLaren Honda  at the winter testing in Jerez, Spain . McLaren Honda do a lap at the Spanish testing circuit at Jerez . 'As they always say, they build road cars to go motor racing, with the last few years very difficult for them to be out of the sport. 'But they are here now and they will be strong, and they will give everything to be strong, which is great.' Button is not offering excuses, but he feels it was wrong of people to criticise Honda's lack of running in Jerez as they were always going to encounter teething problems being so new to the scene. 'They have their targets, and they understand what other people are getting out of their engines, and the strengths and weaknesses of those cars,' added Button. Lewis Hamilton, David Coulthard and Button share a joke when Button was representing Honda Racing . Button and Fernando Alonso share a joke at winter testing in Jerez, Spain . 'It's not like the engine had been driven for three years before the test, and as you know in Formula One, the cars are only just ready for the first run in winter testing. 'Everything arrives at the last moment because you are trying to get everything out of the car and engine before you arrive at that test. 'I'm sure it baffles a lot of people when you see a car turn up at the first test and drive out of the garage at 11am and not 9am. Why couldn't you start two hours earlier? 'It's because you are always trying to maximise the winter and arrive at the first test with the best possible package, and that's why it sometimes starts a little late.' Button believes he still has a lot to achieve now he is working with Honda again .","McLaren have again reunited themselves with Honda from this season .

"Vernon Kay looks ahead to San Francisco's trip to Mile High on Sunday night and their meeting with the Denver Broncos. Broncos quarterback Peyton Manning is just two shy of breaking Brett Favre's all-time record for the most touchdown passes and will be looking to achieve that feat at Sports Authority Field this weekend. The 49ers against the Broncos is a huge game for several reasons. The main reason is the fact that Peyton Manning has the opportunity to surpass Brett Favre's record for most touchdown passes thrown by a quarterback. At the moment Manning has got 506 and needs a couple more to equal the record of 508. But if he was to score three touchdowns on Sunday night live on Channel 4, then he will become the NFL's all-time leading touchdown passer. Peyton Manning has an opportunity to break Brett Favre's record for most touchdown passes ever on Sunday . Denver Broncos fans celebrate Manning's 500th touchdown pass, which he threw against Arizona . Manning has got a trio of exceptional receivers in tight end Julius Thomas, Emmanuel Sanders and Demaryius Thomas. He is the leader of that offense and, if you speak to anyone who knows American football over in the States, they'll tell you that he is more like an offensive coordinator or head coach. He is a phenomenal American footballer, not only physically with his ability to throw the ball, but mentally that he knows the game so well. In my opinion, he is not the best quarterback ever. I think he is exceptional and one of the best we will ever see. But if asked me 'which quarterback would you have on their day?' I would pick Tom Brady. I know it is a team game and not all down to one man, but Brady has won three Super Bowls and Manning has won one. Manning would definitely be in my top three, though, and the other one is Brett Favre. When Favre was playing, he was so devoted to the Green Bay Packers, Minnesota Vikings and even the New York Jets. Manning needs just three more touchdown passes to break Favre's record for most touchdown passes .

San Francisco at Denver, 1.30am . The Super Bowl defeat by the Seattle Seahawks in February is a chip on Manning's shoulder that will be eating him away. He had such a wonderful season in 2013, but then to get absolutely destroyed the way he did against the Seahawks will not sit easily for a player like Manning. The Seahawks admitted that they studied Manning and everything he does, even where he looks prior to the snap. They analysed all his physical movements, body language and just shut him down. It's going to be a tough game for the Broncos on Sunday because one of the surprise packages in the NFL on defense this season is the 49ers secondary. They lost a couple of star players in the off-season but, so far, they are playing really well and are very difficult to pass against. This 49ers defense is quite special. If you look at Ahmad Brooks and Justin Smith, they have got three sacks each this season. I have said it before and I will say it again - I think Justin Smith is one of the best defensive linemen in the league. He is physical, he is strong, he is dominant and whoever you put in front of him is going to face a really tough test. Tom Brady, who has won three Super Bowls in New England, guided the Patriots to a 27-25 win over the Jets . Favre, pictured in action in 1999, won the Super Bowl with the Green Bay Packers in 1997 . Manning leaves the field after Denver's Super Bowl crushing by the Seattle Seahawks in February . On offense, San Francisco's quarterback Colin Kaepernick is one of the most agile and mobile in the league. I think he is the best of this new breed of quarterbacks. With the read option, he doesn't mind being hit or tackled, a bit like Panthers quarterback Cam Newton. Kaepernick is like a 12th man on the field because he has the capability to run down the field. That is something the Broncos defense will have to adjust to. If DeMarcus Ware and Von Miller can contain the outside then it should be easier for the Denver defense to keep Kaepernick in the pocket. But it is always difficult for teams to do that because he is such a good runner of the football. The 49ers have got so much talent. I tried to read up on what is going on in their locker room and it may just be the way coach Jim Harbaugh relays his tactics and speaks to his team. Denver duo Demarcus Ware and Von Miller chase down New York Jets quarterback Geno Smith . San Francisco 49ers head coach Jim Harbaugh (right) talks to his quarterback Colin Kaepernick . Frank Gore (left) is second on the list of most rushing yards among active players in the NFL . There is so much talent on that team and Kaepernick has thrown 10 touchdowns to six different receivers. You can't predict where he is going to throw the ball because stats show he is capable of throwing to anyone. They have also got Frank Gore at running back, who is second on the list of most rushing yards among active players behind only Steven Jackson. One thing about the Broncos is that they always seem to start slow and then pull away. Against the 49ers, they need to have a really good first half.

"Vernon Kay looks ahead to the Chicago Bears’ visit to the San Francisco 49ers, which will be shown live on Channel 4 on Sunday night. The 49ers began their season with a 28-17 victory at the Dallas Cowboys last Sunday, but the Bears suffered a 23-20 defeat by the Buffalo Bills at Soldier Field. It is always difficult for a team in the NFL to start positively when they’ve got a new head coach. The Chicago Bears, since losing Lovie Smith, have had a massive transition. Last year was a difficult year because of people’s thoughts towards Jay Cutler. I think he’s the key to this team and it’s about how consistent he can be and whether he has got the weapons to be successful. I like Cutler but, from an outside perspective, I think he needs that extra level of leadership - something like an Aaron Rodgers or Tom Brady gives a team. If you look at Peyton Manning, he is the leader of the Denver Broncos, and once you’ve got a quarterback who can establish leadership then it makes it easier for the offense. I don’t think Cutler has that presence or persona. He can throw the ball, but if he wants to be a dominant force then he needs to be a bigger leader. Vernon Davis catches a touchdown pass during the San Francisco 49ers' 28-27 win over Dallas Cowboys . Colin Kaepernick, pictured handing off to Frank Gore, provides a threat with both his arm and legs . If you look at the 49ers, in my eyes Colin Kaepernick is not the best quarterback in the league. But San Francisco have given him probably the best set of options. He has got good receivers in Anquan Boldin and Michael Crabtree – regardless of what Richard Sherman says. He’s also got a decent tight end in Vernon Davis and a good running game led by Frank Gore. Also, with Kaepernick’s ability to run the ball as well, the defense has to draw up another play in the book to stop that. Not all quarterbacks like to move outside the pocket and run the ball. The Chicago Bears suffered a 23-20 defeat by the Buffalo Bills in their opening game of the season . Jay Cutler came under fire last season but has retained his place as the starting quarterback for the Bears . Miami at Buffalo, 6pm . Detroit at Carolina, 6pm . Atlanta at Cincinnati, 6pm . New Orleans at Cleveland, 6pm . New England at Minnesota, 6pm . Arizona at New York Giants, 6pm . Dallas at Tennessee, 6pm . Jacksonville at Washington, 6pm . Seattle at San Diego, 9.05pm . St Louis at Tampa Bay, 9.05pm . Kansas City at Denver, 9.25pm . New York Jets at Green Bay, 9.25pm . Houston at Oakland, 9.25pm . Chicago at San Francisco, 1.30am . If the Bears are playing the New England Patriots and Brady, it will be a completely different game. All the defense has to do is make sure they are where they need to be to catch the ball. But with the 49ers, not only have they got to be wary of the running game and the passing game, they’ve also got to realise that they have to contain Kaepernick because he is a weapon. In the San Francisco defense, Justin Smith is awesome – I wish he played for the London Warriors. I can’t believe how powerful he is. I watched the game against the Cowboys on Sunday and he is just something else. With the Cowboys, three of their last four first-round draft picks have all been offensive linemen, so we are not talking about dodgy offensive linemen. But Smith literally ripped them apart and is quite a dominant force. It’s difficult in transition and the 49ers have a couple of rookies in their defense. Rumour has it that Jim Harbaugh has lost the locker room, but when you have the reputation that the 49ers have, it is hard to let go of. They have still got Patrick Willis in there who is an amazing linebacker and can lead the troops as well. I have no doubt that San Francisco will make the play-offs. San Francisco 49ers defensive lineman Justin Smith sacks Dallas Cowboys quarterback Tony Romo . I thought the Bears where unlucky to lose to Buffalo in week one. But the thing with week one is that a lot of teams hold things back in pre-season and don’t show their hand. If you look at the way the Detroit Lions came out on Monday against the New York Giants, they were just phenomenal. They have got a new offense in store and their offensive coordinator Joe Lombardi used to be the quarterback coach for the New Orleans Saints. They are literally running the Saints offense and it works for the artillery that the Lions have. Obviously, with Calvin ‘Megatron’ Johnson, you can just throw the ball anywhere and he will go and get it, but they’ve got Reggie Bush to run the ball and they’ve got numerous tight ends that they’ve brought in to mirror the Saints offense. It works for their quarterback Matthew Stafford and he had a great game. They just destroyed the Giants defense on Monday. Calvin Johnson celebrates a touchdown during the Detroit Lions' thumping win over the New York Giants . On the flip side, Eli Manning has won the Super Bowl twice with the Giants. But, if you talk about offensive weapons, slowly over the last couple of seasons they have taken away the team around him. He’s playing with a handful of rookie running backs and has got a new set of receivers. He has got a completely new offense and he struggled. I think the Bears will have it tough in their division. That NFC North is the toughest division in the league with the Lions, Packers and Vikings. It is ridiculous. Now that the Vikings have settled on a quarterback and are taking the ball away from Adrian Peterson, that they have got confidence in the troops they’ve got around Matt Cassel. They’ve given Cassel confidence and let him play his game instead of undermining him by giving the ball to Peterson all the time. Now they’re willing to throw the ball, it makes defenses think: ‘Adrian might not get the ball, so we’ll have to go cover two instead of cover four.’ San Francisco will play their first competitive game at their brand new Levi's Stadium in Santa Clara . Sunday night’s game will be the first at San Francisco’s brand new Levi’s Stadium. I’ve not been yet - I’ll probably be there for Super Bowl 50 - but by all accounts it is absolutely stunning. I have a friend who has been there who said it is amazing. I just hope it starts to build a reputation like Candlestick Park did because I remember watching American football late at night during the 1980s on Channel 4. They were those muddy games where the 49ers were playing the Giants or the Cowboys. Old school fans will miss those muddy shirts in the play-offs.

"Vernon Kay looks ahead to Sunday night’s NFC East showdown between the New York Giants and Philadelphia Eagles. The Eagles are top of the NFC East with four wins from their opening five games this season, but the Giants draw level with their rivals with victory at Lincoln Financial Field on Sunday. When I saw that Channel 4 was covering this game, it brought back real fond memories of what the NFL to me is all about. This is one of the hardest and toughest rivalries that the league has to offer. The Giants and Eagles are pretty much neighbours in terms of states. It is a bitter rivalry that is on par with Liverpool against Manchester United. Over the years the Giants always seemed to come out on top when the likes of Phil Simms and Lawrence Taylor were playing and Bill Parcells was their head coach. The Eagles had Randall Cunningham who, little did we know then, subliminally reinvented the quarterback position if you look at the quarterbacks we have now that can run and throw like Cam Newton and Robert Griffin III. Eli Manning's New York Giants take on the Philadelphia Eagles with a chance to go joint top of the NFC East . Nick Foles has been below-par  with five interceptions so far this season and a banged up offensive line . New England at Buffalo, 6pm . Carolina at Cincinnati, 6pm . Pittsburgh at Cleveland, 6pm . Green Bay at Miami, 6pm . Detroit at Minnesota, 6pm . Denver at New York Jets, 6pm . Baltimore at Tampa Bay, 6pm . Jacksonville at Tennessee, 6pm . San Diego at Oakland, 9.05pm . Washington at Arizona, 9.25pm . Chicago at Atlanta, 9.25pm . Dallas at Seattle, 9.25pm . New York Giants at Philadelphia, 1.30am . At the moment, it is all much of a muchness in the NFC East. The rivalries within the NFC East are epic and this is always an exciting division. It’s a shame the Redskins can’t get up and running, but this division could be won by any one of the Eagles, Cowboys and Giants. I think it’s going to be even-steven all the way and whoever comes third might even have a shot at a Wild Card spot. Eli Manning has been on fire in the last few games for the Giants. He started the season a bit shaky and everyone was talking about him being prone to interceptions. But in the last two games he has scored more than 30 points in each game. His favourite target is his tight end Larry Donnell, which is interesting because the Giants very rarely use their tight ends. But, having said that, Victor Cruz is on form now as well and Odell Beckham Jr is coming into the frame too. Eli has got his haters. He is a bit like Tony Romo in the sense that you either like him or you loathe him. But he’s a proven Super Bowl winner. He has won more Super Bowls than his brother even though Peyton is smashing records. There is only one statistic that really matters in the NFL - how many Super Bowl rings you are wearing. Randall Cunningham during his time as quarterback of the Philadelphia Eagles in 1990 . Andre Williams celebrates a touchdown for the Giants in their win over the Atlanta Falcons . Unfortunately for the Giants, their running back Rashad Jennings is injured for this game. But they have another running back in Andre Williams stepping up. He is a big, powerful running back who can take the hits. On the flip side, the Eagles defense is not the best. They’ve allowed more than 400 yards per game, which is pretty shocking. Their secondary is pretty flaky as well and if Cruz, Donnell and Beckham Jr can get going for the Giants then it is going to be a high-scoring game. With the Eagles offense, everyone talked about Chip Kelly coming into the league with his spread formation and quick tempo. That seems to have slowed down now. Michael Vick has left and Nick Foles is at the helm, but he needs a good game against the Giants. He has an opportunity to really open up this New York secondary, but the problem is that his offensive line is pretty banged up. For this offense to work, he needs time to release the ball. Last year he only had two interceptions but he has had five already this season. I think that comes down to the fact that his offensive line is pretty banged up. Victor Cruz (right) and Rueben Randle (centre) celebrate a touchdown for the Giants . Running back Darren Sproles moved to Philadelphia from the New Orleans Saints . At running back, Darren Sproles is so small and fast and he makes it tough for the big defensive guys up front. LeSean McCoy doesn’t need any introduction because he has proven that he is one of the best running backs in the NFL. It depends on whether the offensive line for the Eagles is up to holding back the Giants defensive line. That is what this game will come down to because they have both got a shaky secondary.

"The Seattle Seahawks look to make it back-to-back Super Bowl victories when they take on the New England Patriots, the last team to achieve the feat. The Bill Belichick/Tom Brady axis rides into its sixth NFL showpiece, with an evenly-matched, intriguing encounter expected at the University of Phoenix Stadium in Glendale, Arizona. Belichick will need all of his tactical nous to get one over Pete Carroll, who along with general manager John Schneider has transformed Seattle from also-rans to the team to beat in just five years. Ahead of Sunday’s game, here are ten players who will shape the destiny of the Vince Lombardi Trophy. Brandon Browner, cornerback, New England . Left Seattle in free agency after three years with the Seahawks. He will line up against his former team-mates with an inside knowledge on defensive schemes and how to hinder wide receivers Jermaine Kearse and Doug Baldwin. Brandon Browner left Seattle in free agency after three years in the north west and joined New England . Earl Thomas, free safety, Seattle . Dislocated his shoulder in the NFC Championship game but recovered sufficiently enough to say that the injury felt like a 10 on Wednesday. He was miffed to be tested for HGH by the NFL as a consequence, but the real examination will come against the likes of LeGarrette Blount and Rob Gronkowski. Seattle Seahawks free safety Earl Thomas talks to the media in Arizona in the lead up to the game . Rob Gronkowski, tight end, New England . Tom Brady’s go-to guy is a 6ft 6in beast who wows fans and players alike with his antics on the field. His off-field ones aren’t bad either, but I digress. He is big, fast, powerful, and crucially fully fit for his second Super Bowl. Rob Gronkowski has been fitter and healthier this season than in the last few years . Marshawn Lynch, running back, Seattle . The unstoppable Lynch will carry the offense with his trademark bow-legged runs. He’s set for carries galore and with 815 yards and eight touchdowns in nine postseason games, who would rule out a second ring for Beast Mode? Marshawn Lynch has been at the centre of attention this week for what he hasn't said to the media . LeGarrette Blount, running back, New England . Picked up off waivers in November, Blount returned to New England and helped them into the Super Bowl with 148 yards against Indianapolis. Whether he can repeat those numbers against Seattle’s third-ranked run defense remains to be seen. LeGarrette Blount joined New England in November and has helped their running game become even better . Tom Brady, quarterback, New England . Is set to appear in a record-breaking sixth Super Bowl. If New England triumph, he will join Terry Bradshaw and Joe Montana on four victories, but if the Seahawks can disrupt him in the pocket and deny him time as they did Peyton Manning a year ago, his task will be a difficult one. Tom Brady is looking to win his fourth Super Bowl this weekend at the University of Phoenix Stadium . Jamie Collins, linebacker, New England . Versatile, fast and capable of game-chinging plays, the second-year sensation is like a chess piece. He can do it all from rushing the passer, tackling running backs and covering downfield. New England Patriots linebacker Jamie Collins speaks out on Super Bowl media day . Russell Wilson, quarterback, Seattle . Has a record of 9-0 against Super Bowl-winning quarterbacks in his all-conquering three-year NFL career. If he leads the Seahawks to back-to-back titles he has a legitimate claim on elite level. Seattle Seahawks quarterback Russell Wilson is looking to win his second straight Super Bowl crown . Richard Sherman, cornerback, Seattle . A shutdown corner with a motivational mouth to boot, Sherman finished the Green Bay game one-handed. But his recovery from a sprained elbow will be tested by Brady, Gronkowski and Co. Richard Sherman leads Seattle's dominant defensive group known as the 'Legion of Boom' Kam Chancellor, strong safety, Seattle . Expect fireworks as All-Pro Chancellor, the hardest-hitting safety in the game, is likely to be charged with keeping Gronkowski quiet. This unenviable task is made more challenging as 11 of 17 passing touchdowns scored against Seattle were scored by tight ends this season. Kam Chancellor answers questions on media day leading up to the Super Bowl in Glendale .","New England Patriots face Seattle Seahawks in Super Bowl on Sunday .

"Vernon Kay looks ahead to this Sunday night’s contest between the Pittsburgh Steelers and Carolina Panthers, which will be shown live on Channel 4. The Panthers lead the way in the NFC South with two wins from their opening two games this season. The Steelers, meanwhile, will be looking to bounce back from their heavy loss against AFC North rivals Baltimore last Thursday. I’m very excited to have a first look at the Panthers on Channel 4 this season for one reason– Cam Newton (if he plays). He is too big a player to risk but on the flip side he is too big a player not to have in the game. Ever since we saw a first glimpse of Cam at Auburn, when he won the National Championship in college, he excited a lot of people in the NFL. He was the start of this new breed of quarterback that it seems RG3 has made famous – being able to run and pass. But I think Newton was the originator for this breed. If you watch the way he plays, with confidence and a smile on his face, that’s why it’s always exciting to see him on our screens. Carolina are 2-0 at the moment, and if head coach Ron Rivera can carry on the momentum from last season then they’ve got a real chance of getting into the play-offs. Atlanta are strong as well. They absolutely destroyed the Buccaneers on Thursday night, and I think the Buccaneers will struggle this year. Cam Newton reacts after throwing a touchdown during the impressive dismantling of the Detroit Lions . Newton celebrates with Panthers fans after victory over Detroit which took the Panthers to 2-0 . But the surprise in that division is the Saints. It’s not like them to start off 0-2 and go on a losing streak straight from the off. But I think it gives Carolina a real opportunity to make some headway in the division and then into the play-offs. If Newton can get fit and stay fit, then they have a great chance. My only concern is that they use Greg Olsen as their primary receiver since the loss of Steve Smith – who joined the Baltimore Ravens. Their go-to receiver is a tight end and it’s debatable whether that can be the case. We’ve seen it with Tom Brady and Rob Gronkowski in New England, and with Drew Brees and Jimmy Graham in New Orleans, but I think Carolina will miss having a go-to wide receiver. Cam likes to scramble out of the pocket and that is a great bonus for the receivers because it draws the defensive backs down to the line of scrimmage. With Cam’s scrambling ability, it gives the wide receivers the opportunity to stay wide open. For the Panthers to improve, they need to establish the run game. They have DeAngelo Williams at running back. He is averaging 5.1 yards per carry, which is good, but you need a solid run game. If you have a running game it asks questions of a defense and their ability to read the run and read the pass. Greg Olsen (right) is used as a go-to receiver, and he attempts to evade the Lions' Stephen Tulloch . If fit, tailback DeAngelo Williams, who trained for the first time in a week on Friday, is a boon to the offense . San Diego at Buffalo, 6pm . Tennessee at Cincinnati, 6pm . Baltimore at Cleveland, 6pm . Green Bay at Detroit, 6pm . Indianapolis at Jacksonville, 6pm . Oakland at New England, 6pm . Minnesota at New Orleans, 6pm . Houston at New York Giants, 6pm . Washington at Philadelphia, 6pm . Dallas at St Louis, 6pm . San Francisco at Arizona, 9.05pm . Kansas City at Miami, 9.25pm . Denver at Seattle, 9.25pm . Pittsburgh at Carolina, 1.30am . On the defense, they have Luke Kuechly – what a player! He has got to be in the top three linebackers in the league. Kuechly is the new breed of defensive athlete. If you look at his physical build, he’s 238lbs and that is quite light for a linebacker. But he’s got fantastic speed, knows the game and can read the game very well. I would definitely make the Panthers favourites to win the NFC South now. At the start of the season I would have gone for the Saints. But they lost their quarterback coach Joe Lombardi, who went to Detroit to become their offensive coordinator. Even with Drew Brees at quarterback they’ll struggle to catch up with the Panthers. If the Panthers can build momentum and get Newton fully fit, I would put money on them to win that division. As for Pittsburgh, the loss to Baltimore was a tough game for everyone because of the Ray Rice situation. The atmosphere and build-up to the game wasn’t around football, it was on an off-field matter that took the shine off that game. The hard-hitting Luke Kuechly (right) is the defensive rookie of the year and gets to grips with Calvin Johnson . The game on Sunday against the Panthers will be crucial for the Steelers to establish themselves. They need to get their running back Le’Veon Bell going. He’s averaging 5.3 yards per carry but I don’t think he looks confident. He’s also their second most successful receiver so they’re not going deep that much, they’re throwing it in the flat to the running backs. Antonio Brown has had one touchdown for 206 yards so far which is not bad. The receptions are pretty much spread out between Brown (12), Bell (11) and Markus Wheaton (11). So you can tell what they’re trying to do with the passing game. But they need to get their running game going as well with Bell and there is something about him that looks a bit nervous. The AFC North is the most ridiculous division ever because you have got bitter rivalries in this division. Being a Bolton Wanderers fan, it is like Bolton, Bury and Burnley. It’s that type of nitty-gritty division where they are all working-class towns and the football team is pivotal to the community. Antonio Brown (centre) has been the Steelers' most successful receiver so far this season . Ben Roethlisberger has shed the pounds in the post-season and looks more mobile than in recent seasons . With the rise of the Bengals as well, they’ve had a great start. I don’t think it’s a surprise after they gave their quarterback Andy Dalton a massive boost by giving him a massive contract. It took the pressure off him and the team, not having to worry about having an established quarterback. I always like the Ravens. With John Harbaugh as head coach, even though what they’ve gone through has been tricky for everyone involved with the franchise, I think they know how to win. Big Ben looks like he’s worked really hard during the off-season. He’s still a big lad but hasn’t got that paunch and he looks as agile and mobile as ever. He is the key for the Steelers and I don’t think that will change for a long time. Roethlisberger has a great relationship with head coach Mike Tomlin and they have got faith in him as a quarterback. If you look at his Super Bowl victories, I think he thrives under pressure. He can really pull it out of the bag when needed and that’s the type of player I like – one that’s got balls.

"Twenty One years have passed since Danny Blanchflower died. He was a wonderful footballer and, in his later years, a captivating journalist. Yet he will be chiefly remembered for one observation. ‘The great fallacy is that the game is first and last about winning. It’s nothing of the kind,’ said Danny. ‘The game is about glory. It’s about doing things in style, with a flourish, about going out and beating the other lot, not waiting for them to die of boredom.’ In truth, it was more than an observation. With Blanchflower, it was an expression of a deeply-held conviction. And that conviction was shared by people we revere, from Ferguson to Flintoff, Botham to Ballesteros. Of course it was romantic, and bloodless pragmatists would tell us it was hopelessly idealistic. But if romance and idealism could find no place in sport, then sport would not be worth our time or our trouble. Somebody once described sport as ‘a glorious irrelevance’, and that seems about right. When we step back, we see there is something inherently trivial in the spectacle of adults playing the games that children play. Danny Blanchflower holds aloft the Cup Winners Cup after Tottenham won it in 1963-63 . Former Spurs player famously said: 'The game is about glory. It’s about doing things in style, with a flourish' From time to time we squirm when a po-faced manager proclaims: ‘Football isn’t a matter of life and death. It’s much more important than that,’ thus quoting something Bill Shankly never actually said. Because neither football nor sport itself is really that important and to believe otherwise is to sanction all manner of grotesque excess. The growth of the drug culture is the inevitable consequence of that attitude. In my half-century of covering sport, the mood has changed from blissful naivete to instinctive cynicism. The magnificent sport of track and field has been allowed to degenerate into something resembling a competition between chemists. Cycling is equally bad and probably worse. Professional boxing, already on its last legs, offers opportunities for the desperate and deluded, while any physical comparison between today’s rugby players and those of, say, 20 years earlier, yields startling results. Given the widespread use of performance-enhancing substances in many sports, it is difficult to believe a sport as wealthy and physically demanding as football is impervious to temptation. Disgraced cyclist Lance Armstrong was stripped of his seven Tour de France titles for doping . Sprinter Justin Gatlin was banned for four years after testing positive for performance enhancing drugs . The issue of wealth — largely due to television money — has transformed our perceptions of sport. For the first 13 years of The Mail on Sunday's existence, rugby maintained the pretence it was an ‘amateur’ game. Reality was recognised when it went ‘open’ in 1995. After years of comparative penury, Test cricketers are now being paid what they are worth and earnings have generally improved, save for those young county pros whom the sensitive Kevin Pietersen last week referred to as: ‘All the muppets who are on £18 grand.’ But football has seen the real explosion of wealth. With its extraordinary television deal and its contemptible refusal to offer lesser leagues a reasonable share of its bounty, the Premier League has become opulent beyond imagination. Much of this has gone to the players who generate the riches and are therefore the most deserving. A good deal has gone to clubs who persist in extorting the highest ticket charges in Europe despite their windfall. But an offensive chunk has gone to that band of blood-suckers known as ‘football agents,’ who perform no useful function, contribute nothing and who, in 2013-2014, took out an obscene total of £115.2m. It is a scandal which football seems strangely incapable of eliminating. The introduction of the Premier League has brought huge sums of money into football . The Premier League bounty has not been fairly distributed to the lower leagues in England . Agents such as Jorge Mendes have become serious financial players in the world of football . So, with too many drugs, too much money and an extravagant sense of self-importance, has sport been digging its own grave these past 50 years? Not at all. Without pausing to reach for a reference book, I set the images whirling across the memory like characters on a carousel. There was Federer and McEnroe, the fading Ali and the bull named Tyson. There was Ovett, Coe and Daley, Mo and Jessica, Carl Lewis and Usain Bolt, Dan Carter, Shaun Edwards, Brian O’Driscoll and Serge Blanco. There was the graceful Gower and mesmeric Warne, Sachin and Vivian, Holding and Sir Garfield. And there was Best and Cantona, the majestic Moore and that incomparable Barcelona team which Pep Guardiola assembled, a side sprinkled with stars and little Messi shining brightest. In the face of such majesty, of brilliance akin to genius, sport’s drawbacks seem no more than minimal distractions. I can think of lofty pundits who believe it all a colossal waste of time and energy, and that those of us who cherish sport would be far better employed in grown-up activities, like demonising immigrants or sneering at ‘benefit scroungers’. Each to his own. I am thankful I chose sport. In this, I am at one with Earl Warren, formerly the Chief Justice of the US Supreme Court, who said: ‘I always turn to the sports section first. The sports section records people’s accomplishments; the front page nothing but man’s failures.’ It was a generalisation, but it contained more than a nugget of truth. For sport at its cleanest and brightest generates a sense of wonder, a feeling that peaks are being scaled and limits are being breached. Some experience such exalted emotions in a theatre or a gallery but, for many, the magic is to be found amid the sweat and the din of an arena. Danny was right, winning is the least of it. For sport is about style and nerve and grace and glory. Especially glory. Long may the glory endure.","Danny Blanchflower famously said 'the game is about glory' not winning .

"Roger Goodell says London’s response to the NFL is ‘better than we ever dreamed’ - but stopped short of saying a franchise will be moving across the Atlantic. At his annual ‘State of the NFL’ address, the 55-year-old commissioner twice dodged a definitive answer to the question. NFL commissioner Roger Goodell said London games had exceeded all expectations . ‘London has done not only everything that we expected but more than we expected, they are responding to the game better than we ever dreamed with more enthusiasm, more passion,’ he said. ‘You see it every year, the passion, the understanding of the game, every event that we have explodes with interest,’ he added. ‘We are continuing to advance our interests over there from the standpoint of playing more games.’ said Goodell. ‘The passion is obvious, we want to continue to respond to that fan interest and if we do - we don’t know where it will go but there is great potential in London for the NFL.’ During his 45 minute address, Goodell faced a wide range of questions and admitted he has not given a thought to resigning despite a ‘tough year’ for the NFL. Detroit Lions beat Atlanta Falcons with a dramatic last-gasp field goal at Wembley in October . The 55-year-old has attracted criticism in many quarters for his handled of the Ray Rice and Adrian Peterson cases. Goodell promised that the league will also undergo a ‘serious’ and ‘thorough’ review of the Deflategate saga. When asked if he will give an apology to New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft if the Patriots are cleared of wrongdoing, Goodell replied: ‘This my job. This is my responsibility, to protect the integrity of this game. I represent 32 teams.’ Seahawks running back Marshawn Lynch could face fine for wearing ‘Beast Mode’ cap . The NFL will decide on the response to Seattle Seahawks running back Marshawn Lynch wearing non-licences ‘Beast Mode’ cap during media appearances after Super Bowl. And Goodell responded to Lynch’s handling of media duties this week. ‘It’s part of your job,’ Goodell said. ‘There are things in your job that you might not necessarily want to do. I think Marshawn understands the importance of the Super Bowl and the importance of his appearance in the Super Bowl.’ Singer Lenny Kravitz, right, joined actor Jamie Foxx for Super Bowl radio show on Sirius XM .

"The most depressing words of this young sporting year were spoken last week by Jimmy Anderson. By common consent, the England fast bowler is a gentle, pleasant, rather shy individual, whose attitudes change dramatically when he walks on to a cricket pitch. He then becomes a stage villain; angry, confrontational and abrasively insulting. One of the more discordant sounds of an English summer is the distant drone of Anderson sledging his chosen victim. But he has no regrets; indeed, he is actually proud of his behaviour. One of the more discordant sounds of an English summer is the distant drone of James Anderson sledging . England's Anderson (right) believes sledging is entertaining when done in the right manner . ‘I don’t think at the moment there is any more sledging than there’s been in the history of cricket,’ he said. ‘I don’t think it should disappear from the game. I think it’s quite entertaining when it’s done in the right manner.’ Equally smug is the Australian wicket keeper Brad Haddin, who defended David Warner after the serial buffoon had been heard to bawl ‘Speak English!’ at India’s Rohit Sharma. ‘We know the brand of cricket we want to play and Davey’s no different to all of us,’ said Haddin. ‘Every Australian team I’ve played in respects the game of cricket and respects the opposition. We’re pretty comfortable with the way we’re playing.’ He was supported by Australia’s coach Darren Lehmann, aka ‘Boof’. ‘If the ICC decides it’s not in the spirit of the game or we cross the line, it’ll come down on us,’ he said. ‘We’re always going to teeter pretty close to it, that’s just the way we play, but we’ve got to make sure we don’t cross it.’ Interestingly, Boof has some form on the disciplinary front. There was that unfortunate business in 2003, when he shouted ‘black *****’ in the dressing room after being run out against Sri Lanka at Brisbane. He was banned for five matches, thus escaping far too lightly. Then there was his jibe at England’s paceman Stuart Broad, shortly before the 2013-14 Ashes series Down Under: ‘I just hope the Australian public give it to him right from the word go for the whole summer, and I hope he cries and goes home.’ That’s Boof, one of nature’s line-crossers. Australia's David Warner argues with India's Rohit Sharma during their one day international . Now it is probably true that few people outside Australia take Lehmann seriously, but Anderson’s position is far more disturbing. For he sincerely believes that sledging, the crude, ugly, choreographed abuse of an opponent, is not only legitimate but ‘quite entertaining’. Andrew Flintoff exposed the fallacy of that approach in two concise sentences. ‘It seems you can walk onto the field, say anything you want about somebody and then walk off and forget about it,’ said Freddie. ‘You wouldn’t walk into somebody’s office and let rip at them for 10 minutes and then go for a cup of tea.’ Jonathan Agnew, the former England fast bowler and BBC cricket correspondent, expressed his concern rather more vigorously. ‘It’s all you hear on a field — “Knock his head off, knock his head off”,’ he said. ‘Cricket has gone too far. It shouldn’t be posturing, abusing.’ He defended aggressive bowling, but insisted: ‘It’s the histrionics, the nonsense, the prancing, the in-your-face nastiness. It’s become accepted, and actually it’s not acceptable at all.’ Agnew was absurdly attacked for his stand, on the grounds that cricketers have been behaving badly throughout the history of the game; as if oafishness was sanctified by custom. But he was undeniably correct. There is a worrying belief that the game alone is incapable of holding the public’s attention. Hence the search for trivial solutions and cheap gimmicks. Less a game, more a game show, in which nothing succeeds like excess. Queens Park Rangers' Joey Barton is one of football's most prolific self-promoting 'characters' Football has travelled some way along that path, with a turgid cast of self-promoting ‘characters’, along with talkSPORT, Robbie Savage, Joey Barton, and lashings of banal banter from mirthless celebs. A wonderful game, intelligently administered, yet selling itself short by embracing embarrassing distractions. As for professional boxing, it long ago abandoned any ambition to be treated as serious sport. The fighters themselves remain wonderful athletes and admirable people, but the sad old game is now a branch of showbusiness, with its ring-walks and its trash-talk, its scripted threats and its phony feuds. The sport which once gave us Ali and Frazier now offers Bermane Stiverne and Deontay Wilder, not to mention Tyson Fury and Dereck Chisora. The well is dry, the end is a matter of time. If all this should sound unremittingly bleak, then the impression is false. Despite the dreary drip of resentful criticism, the 2012 Olympics left our sport in a healthier, more confident condition. Tyson Fury (right) and Dereck Chisora face off before their heavyweight fight last November . Despite an unprecedented number of counter-attractions, sport at large — and most prominently the crown jewel sport of cycling — is fighting the good fight for attention and participation. Those of us who stood on the packed pavements to watch the Tour de France speed through the glories of the Yorkshire countryside will testify that the British respond to genuine sporting events like no other nation. We remain hopelessly in thrall to sport, yet that sport must be valid, authentic, untainted by contrivance. And that is why Anderson’s remark was so concerning. For there is no right to abuse, no licence to insult. The belief such behaviour is ‘quite entertaining’ is the cod philosophy of the professional wrestling ring. It is a great pity, for English cricket is currently facing all manner of demanding problems. Jimmy Anderson has made their solution no easier. Neville’s reputation dented by his drivel . By the knee-jerk standards of television punditry, Gary Neville is a serious man. But even serious men can be swept away by the pressure to transform the mundane into something guaranteed to start an argument in the pub. Hence his reaction when an Everton footballer named Kevin Mirallas became involved in a foolish spat with his colleague and designated penalty taker, Leighton Baines, over who should take a penalty in the match with West Bromwich. Having insisted on taking the kick, Mirallas missed it, thereby costing his team two crucial points. Now we can probably agree that Mirallas is an irksome clown, that Baines is more docile than an England defender ought to be and that the Everton captain Phil Jagielka has the leadership qualities of a garden gnome. Kevin Mirallas (right) talks to Leighton Baines and holds the ball in his hands, determined to take the penalty . Gary Neville described Mirallas' decision to take the penalty as a 'despicable breach of team orders' Jamie Carragher said Everton's senior players should have intervened and told Mirallas to let Baines take it . But that did not go nearly far enough for our Gary. It was, he said, ‘a scandal’. ‘One of the most despicable breaches of team spirit you can possibly have. You do not do that at any cost!’ And there was more. ‘It doesn’t get much worse,’ said Neville. ‘You can punch someone, you can go over the top and break someone’s leg, which is unnecessary, in a tackle, but to go against team orders in the dressing room is terrible. It’s one of the worst things you can do.’ The entire diatribe was delivered with an heroically straight face. Yet Neville was talking the kind of nonsense he would have mocked without mercy in his days as a player. Does he seriously believe that snapping an opponent’s leg is merely ‘unnecessary’, but taking a penalty against orders is scandalous, selfish and despicable? Of course not. But Sky Sports is never knowingly undersold, so he delivered his drivel in apocalyptic tones, while the suits in the studio stared on in mute approval. Next time controversy comes along, we must hope that Neville resists the lure of amateur dramatics. For he is a serious man, with points to make and things to say. And now, a reputation to retrieve. P.S. He has a formidable record at major football clubs. He also enjoys an imperious air, a disdainful stare and a way with an empty platitude. And yet, his tactics appear to bewilder his own players and his team is frequently sterile and unappealing. If he possessed an ordinary name — something like ‘David Moyes’, perhaps — the manager of Manchester United might be under a great deal of pressure. Instead, his name is Louis van Gaal and he is currently immune from criticism. He really ought to make the most of the truce. For it may not last. Louis van Gaal has hardly fared any better than David Moyes but has so far been immune from criticism .","James Anderson said sledging is fine when done in the right way .

"Abbey Stadium is the kind of football ground usually described as ‘homely’. The stands are modest, the away section lies close by a field where cows may safely graze, and the entire place can accommodate 9,617 people, although the capacity is rarely approached. The refreshments, however, are said to be excellent, especially the bacon rolls, which cost £3 and have been deemed ‘legendary’ by visiting fans. On Friday evening, those desirable rolls will sell as never before. The reason is what the BBC insists upon calling ‘the magic of the Cup’. A numbered wooden ball, plucked from a clacking bunch, dispatched Manchester United to East Anglia, to the delight of the corporation. It was for just such an occasion that the BBC invested in live football. Sky had long since annexed the Premier League in a wad-waving swirl of Super Sundays and Magic Mondays. A board outside The Abbey Stadium shows Cambridge's next games with the Cup tie with Manchester United sandwiched between league games with Newport and Wycombe . But the FA Cup was different; competitive yet civilised, curiously quaint yet undeniably contemporary, and laden with almost 144 years of history. In short, it was an institution which simply reeked of class, and the BBC - in alliance with BT Sport - were mightily pleased with their acquisition. And here’s the strangest thing: their satisfaction was absolutely justified, and Friday’s fourth-round tie will prove their point. Unless both Chelsea and Manchester City take an almighty tumble at Becher’s Brook, then United will not win the title. All the more reason, then, for Louis van Gaal’s team to pursue the FA Cup; not only does ultimate victory guarantee a place in a relatively lucrative European competition, but it appeases the fans by delivering what the jargon calls ‘silverware’. It is a prize worth winning. A scarf pre-sale in preparation for the FA Cup match between Cambridge and Manchester United next week . In recent years many have doubted its credentials, credulously believing that the Premier League invented football in 1992. While this heresy suited those who gorged themselves on Rupert Murdoch’s largesse, it crassly excluded clubs of modest means; decent clubs like Cambridge United. For years they have existed on small change; this week, they will enjoy national attention while reaping a reasonable reward. Such is the effect of the FA Cup. It is the stark contrast which makes the contest so alluring. Cambridge have raised their prices, with the lowest set at a reasonable £20. They are guaranteed to earn £234,000 from the tie, through television fees and FA Cup prize-money. In order to maximise their good fortune, they have decided to make all their staff buy their own tickets for the game. This policy has grievously upset at least one turnstile operative, who has grown used to a free place for League Two games and has therefore resigned in protest. Manchester United were drawn away at Cambridge in the FA Cup fourth round . But the reality is that Cambridge have pressing overheads to meet, that their very existence has been at risk these past few years, and that they are therefore obliged to make the most of this fortuitous gift of a Cup tie. After all, they have to meet an annual staff salary bill of almost £1.25million. United have their own financial obligations. Their staff wage bill for last season came in at £214.8m. They spent £150m in the last transfer window, and it is possible that they will hand over the same amount in the current month. Their highest paid player, Wayne Rooney, receives close to £300,000 every week, while they are currently debating the future of their striker Radamel Falcao. Wayne Rooney is one of Manchester United's highest earners and will come up against Cambridge whose players earn far less than he does . A marvellous performer, searching for his form, he is on a £6m loan from Monaco, which will cost United £43.5m to make permanent. He is said to be earning anything up to £265,000 weekly, which means he would have to toil for almost five weeks to cover the cost of the Cambridge salaries. Rooney could do it in four. In short, it is an uneven duel between a global corporation and a corner shop. And yet, and yet . . . nothing is decided, nothing is certain. Which is why the city of Cambridge is in a state of tremulous excitement, why the Cambridge News is offering fans ‘a special goody bag for just £1 that includes a copy of the paper, a souvenir clap banner, a free poster and other items too’. Liam Hughes celebrates scoring for Cambridge United in Saturday's 4-0 win over Newport County . And why the BBC can show the tie at prime time on Friday evening, knowing that viewing figures for the third round were 20 per cent up on last year and aware that the remote prospect of Manchester United coming a terrible cropper will have millions upon millions switching on to see the fun. For this is a competition which was born in the reign of Queen Victoria and the Premiership of Mr Gladstone and has proved an enduring ritual of our national life through the tenure of six monarchs and 25 Prime Ministers. ‘The magic of the Cup’ may be a desperate cliche but, in truth, there are times when only a cliche will do. KP turns his delusion into an art form . Kevin Pietersen just won’t be put down. Having been out of the headlines for several days, he gave a toe-curling interview in which he said: ‘I know the current captain would love to have me in the England team.’ To which Eoin Morgan, the one-day skipper, swiftly responded: ‘I’m very happy with the squad of players I have.’ An ordinary man might have been crushed, but KP seemed to take it as a challenge. So he promptly did something far more disturbing. He engaged the services of one Mick Squires, who is apparently ‘well regarded in the tattoo community’ and was once dubbed ‘The Wizard of Oz’ by Tattoo Master magazine. Kevin Pietersen plays in the Australian Big Bash League for the Melbourne Stars . And Mick, operating at a private clinic in Melbourne, drew a map of the world which started on KP’s chest and stretched around his ribs to his back. Picked out in stars, like angry red weals, were the places in which he scored his hundreds for England. The effect was grotesque. Now you may have your own views on tattooing. Personally, I’ve never understood the practice of allowing a chap who can’t draw to scrawl across your body in ink which can never be erased; but each to his own. Pietersen posted a picture of his new tattoo showing all the places in the world he has scored a Test century . Yet Pietersen’s case feels different. It is as if he is actively refusing to recognise reality. Like one who listens only to the twittering sycophants who tell him he has been grievously wronged, that one day English cricket will come to its senses. So Pietersen, wilfully deluded, takes himself off to Mick the Wizard. He then ambles topless along Bondi Beach, gauchely posing for the passing snappers. As the visiting psychiatrist remarked of the great Basil Fawlty: ‘There’s enough material there for an entire conference.’ P.S. From the moment David Ginola opened his mouth, we knew that his candidacy for the presidency of FIFA was a joke. ‘Corruption is not acceptable… Everyone should have a smile on their face… We want to use the past for a better future’. It was a splendid parody, even if he had been put up to it by a bunch of bookmaking chancers. He well deserves the £250,000 fee he is reportedly receiving. Former Newcastle and Spurs winger David Ginola says he plans to run for president of FIFA . Despite the competition from Ginola, Sepp Blatter is expected to win the FIFA election . And yet, when it is all over, the odious Sepp Blatter will once again be elected to the most powerful office in world football. Now that is a far better joke… but nobody is laughing.","Manchester United vs Cambridge is like a global corporation taking on a corner shop .

"New England Patriots vs Seattle Seahawks . Sunday, 11.30pm GMT (6.30pm ET) University of Phoenix Stadium, Glendale . The eccentric Seattle Seahawks defend their Super Bowl title against New England in Glendale, Arizona looking to become the fist team to win back-to-back title since the Patriots in 2004. In his record sixth appearance in the NFL’s seasonal showpiece, will Tom Brady join the likes of Terry Bradshaw and Joe Montana in winning four rings, or will Seattle make it back-to-back victories? Here is our ultimate A to Z list ahead of this Sunday's blockbuster in Arizona. Arizona . Hosts its third Super Bowl on Sunday. The Patriots have unfinished business in the Grand Canyon State after being denied a perfect season by Eli Manning’s unfancied New York Giants (and David Tyree’s infamous helmet catch) seven years ago. In other news, the Dallas Cowboys won their third title in four years with a 27-17 victory over the Pittsburgh Steelers in Tempe in 1996. The state of Arizona will be hosting the Super Bowl for the third time in it's history this weekend . The helmets of the New England Patriots and Seattle Seahawks laid out in the Arizona desert . Beast Mode . Marshawn Lynch may not talk to the media, but his rumblings on the field are as loud as anything in the NFL. The heart of this Seattle team, the bruising, angry 157 yards he accrued against Green Bay in the NFC Championship game propelled the Seahawks into consecutive Super Bowls. He’s nigh-on impossible to stop, but if the Patriots can contain him, that will go a long way to deciding the destination of the Vince Lombardi Trophy. Marshawn Lynch has stole the show this week in press conferences, despite saying very little . Commercials . Cost an eye-watering $4.5million for a 30-second slot; a $500,000 increase on last year.

Finally healthy for a Super Bowl, New England fans have to hope he’ll leave the kittens at home and give the Seahawks a 'Gronking to Remember’. He’s redefined the tight end position and is arguably the best of all-time, such is the impact made during his five-year career. He could be set for a monster afternoon as 11 of the 17 touchdowns Seattle conceded through the air this season were scored by tight ends. His alma mater is the University of Arizona, so expect antics galore if the Patriots win. Rob Gronkowski has been fitter and healthier this season than he has for a long time for the Patriots . Hoody, The . Ahead of an unprecedented sixth Super Bowl trip, regardless of the result, Bill Belichick’s reputation as one of the NFL’s best ever coaches is unquestioned.

New England Patriots head coach Bill Belichick addresses the media this week in Chandler, Arizona . Island, Revis . Nobody has defended more passes since 2007, so it is little wonder that the Patriots plucked shutdown corner Darrelle Revis from free agency. Is he better than Richard Sherman?

Performing the half-time show at the Super Bowl with the eyes of the world watching is one of the biggest moments of any musician's career. Over the years the likes of Madonna, Beyonce and the Black Eyed Peas have graced the stage, but this weekend the honour will fall to Katy Perry. The 30-year-old Californian superstar will headline the half-time show at this year's Super Bowl. Since bursting onto the scene with hit single I Kissed A Girl in 2008, Perry has had nine No 1 singles in the US as well as two No 1 albums.

Despite losing Brandon Browner, one of its founder members, to the Patriots in free agency, Seattle’s secondary is as fearsome as they come.

Vince Wilfork is one of only two members of the Patriots remaining from their 2004 Super Bowl-winning team . Wilson, Russell . Like Brady, Wilson was underrated in the draft and eventually went to Seattle in the third round. The parallels don’t stop there: both reached two Super Bowls in their first three NFL seasons, with Brady’s Patriots going 40-12, while Wilson's are 42-13. Wilson’s 82 touchdowns and 31 interceptions beat Brady’s 75 and 41, with the Seattle man throwing for 11,591 yards, putting Brady’s 11,523 in the shade. Quarterback Russell Wilson and his Seattle Seahawks team-mates practice in Tempe, Arizona . XLIX . The 49th instalment of the Super Bowl promises to be a classic. But we said that last year.

"The cry rang out on January 1; a warmly familiar sound, like the chimes of Big Ben or the singing of Auld Lang Syne. Jose Mourinho, pouting and paranoid, was cursing the wicked injustices and sinister incompetence of referees. A new year but an old, old whine. The occasion of the latest protest was Chelsea’s emphatic 5-3 defeat at Tottenham. The target could have been anybody with a whistle, but this time the honour fell to Phil Dowd. Early in the match, Dowd had declined to award a penalty when the Spurs defender Jan Vertonghen appeared to handle. The decision was patently honest yet probably mistaken. No matter; Mourinho had identified his excuse and, as the Tottenham goals began to overwhelm his inept defenders, the Chelsea manager went through his objectionable routine. VIDEO Scroll down to see Mourinho pointing to refereeing decisions during bad run . Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho looks frustrated on the sidelines as his team were beaten at Tottenham . The Blues lost 5-3 to their fierce London rivals on New Year's Day at White Hart Lane . Mourinho checking his notes alongside his assistants Steve Holland (left) and Rui Faria (right) Dramatic poses were struck, mundane decisions were dramatically contested, the fourth official was sneeringly harangued. The provocation was relentless, all of it endorsed by the compliant lackeys on his bench. The entire performance was an exercise in self-indulgence and the interview which followed was a piece of ham-fisted malice. He was asked: ‘Was the “campaign”, the “conspiracy” against Chelsea, at work again?’ He replied, archly: ‘It’s a question I don’t want to answer.’ Later, still in full, drama-queen mode, he declared: ‘Every moment is unpredictable, but there are things which are becoming predictable.’ ‘Which are?’ inquired the interviewer. ‘Forget it!’ sniffed Mourinho, subtle as a toddler’s tantrum. Clearly, he had prepared a diatribe over Dowd’s refusal to send off Federico Fazio for a challenge on Eden Hazard. From his position, perhaps 60 yards away, he had been screaming for that red card. Television evidence then demonstrated that Dowd had spotted Fazio’s contact with the ball, a fact which Hazard himself confirmed. It wasn’t good enough for Mourinho, who resorted instead to the spurned penalty. ‘Mr Dowd was too slow to go with the ball,’ he said. ‘He was 40 yards away. He made the right decision. The decision which was 10 metres away he couldn’t make.’ Referee Phil Dowd came under significant criticism from Mourinho after the game on New Year's Day . Cesc Fabregas of Chelsea complains to referee Phil Dowd about being kicked by Jan Vertonghen (right) He was asked about Gary Cahill, twice kicking at the back of Harry Kane within three or four yards of his dugout. ‘I didn’t see that,’ replied Mourinho. It is worth regurgitating the details of his latest escapade, if only to illustrate his abiding philosophy. Throughout his first spell at Stamford Bridge, as well as his time in Madrid and Milan, he repeatedly fell foul of authority through his aggressive attitude towards officials. Some believe it is a calculated strategy to persuade his players that the world is in conspiracy against them. Others insist it is simply a self-aggrandising desire to win every argument and pull every stunt in order to finish at the top of the heap. Of course, he is not the only Premier League manager to scapegoat referees. For some — and tedious grumps like Sam Allardyce and Mark Hughes spring swiftly to mind — blaming the officials has become the default reaction. Garry Monk at Swansea may be painfully naive but he has swiftly acquired the same dubious habit. And for all his admirable qualities, even Arsene Wenger seems to harbour a semi-permanent grudge. Others, despite occasional lapses, appear rather more civilised, notably the two Manchester managers, Louis van Gaal and Manuel Pellegrini, Ronald Koeman at Southampton and Sean Dyche at Burnley. Their pressures are no less than the rest, yet their self-discipline seems more assured. Chelsea defender Gary Cahill appeared to kick Tottenham forward Harry Kane during the second half . Mourinho embraces Tottenham counterpart Mauricio Pochettino following his defeat at White Hart Lane . Which brings us back to Mourinho. Unlike one or two of his contemporaries, he is not an obtuse man; on the contrary, he plainly possesses an agile, original mind. As his record would attest, he is also remarkably good at his job. While many of us will always prefer the beautiful teams created by Pep Guardiola or Sir Alex Ferguson, Mourinho’s sides bear the hallmark of diligent coaching and intense efficiency. Yet we sense he wants something else. He wants to be popular as well as successful; not merely among those starry-eyed admirers who can see no further than the glitter of silver, but in a wider circle, one in which style and personal grace are valued as highly as the narrow-eyed accumulation of points. And it is here that Mourinho falls miserably short. As the new year episode demonstrated, he cannot rid himself of the desire to bully and demean those who stand in his way, nor can he reject the temptation to preen and to posture, to constantly demonstrate his undoubted cleverness. Every quarrel must be won, every grievance must be aired. And when things go badly wrong, every excuse, no matter how bogus, must be shamelessly paraded. He has received an array of blessings, yet crucially he has been denied a sense of self-awareness. In more than two decades of coaching and management, he has enjoyed major achievements, but he has also revealed significant weaknesses. At 51, he still has time to take stock of his situation. We should hope that he uses it wisely. The hero who always delivered will leave a chasm . The great football clubs revere their finest players, but at Liverpool they cherish their legends more dearly than most. Names like St John and Liddell, Hansen, Keegan and Dalglish, right through to the capricious Suarez, form the currency of conversations on Anfield Road. Yet there is just one man who perfectly represents the soul and the spirit of the team in red. Steven Gerrard, who has announced that he will be leaving at the end of the season, is the captain from Central Casting; not simply a sensational footballer, but a man whose energy and pride has so often captivated a club, a city and a sporting nation. Ever since the news was announced, we have been treated to tales of that wondrous evening in Istanbul, when he won the Champions League final virtually single-handed. There was also a magical day in Cardiff, when he practically seized the FA Cup. Gerrard knocks home a penalty at Anfield against Leicester City in the Premier League on New Year's Day . Rafael Benitez joins his captain to show off the FA Cup after Liverpool's triumph in 2006 . But while his career was alive with dramatic occasions and rousing triumphs, the lingering memory will be of the individual who delivered them. Gerrard was the finest English midfield player of his generation by some considerable distance, but he was a good deal more than that. He possessed the kind of gifts which the English crave in their football heroes. He carried himself with the style and purpose of the chosen ones, a square-shouldered, sturdy-chested athlete with running power capable of carrying him through a string of testing seasons. Then there was the touch; delicate when required, subtle when needed, but always applied with devilishly shrewd intent. Gerrard hoists the trophy after inspiring the Miracle of Istanbul and crowning Liverpool European champions . Gerrard scored two penalties against Leicester on New Year's Day in final game before announcing departure . We marvelled, too, at the alliance of impeccable technique and latent strength; the cross-field pass arrowed through 50 undeviating yards, or those surging sprints, which disdained challenges and concluded in violent drives. But above and beyond all this, there was the belief that this outwardly reticent character with the nervous frown and the decent distaste for the spotlight could achieve astonishing things through the ferocity of his ambition. Time and again, he repaid that faith. An uncommon man, is Steven Gerrard. He will leave not a gap, but a chasm. PS . Steve Parish is the chairman of Crystal Palace. He is a pleasant, personable man with a dry sense of humour. His football judgment, however, is another matter. This season, he decided to take on the Premier League with Neil Warnock as his manager. Warnock was hopelessly out of his depth and, to nobody’s surprise, he sank without trace. Crystal Palace chairman Steve Parish alongside new boss Alan Pardew (left) at Villa Park on New Year's Day . Mr Parish has now turned to Alan Pardew. Years of relentless underachievement at Newcastle have not shaken Pardew’s confidence; indeed, when it comes to self-promotion, Pardew can make Jose Mourinho seem shyly insecure. There are interesting times ahead. I fancy Mr Parish will need his sense of humour.","Jose Mourinho targeted referee Phil Dowd after 5-3 defeat to Tottenham .

"By now, the incident is passably familiar. The ruck had concluded, there was a small skirmish, and without warning, Dylan Hartley of Northampton and England smashed his elbow into the side of Matt Smith’s jaw. The Leicester player collapsed, and Hartley was sent off. At which point, certain characters in rugby union began to behave extremely foolishly. Alan Dickens, who is Northampton’s defence coach, declared that Hartley was ‘integral to our culture,’ which says something for their ‘culture’. Tom Wood, Hartley’s colleague for club and country, rallied his depleted forces with a fraudulent cry of ‘Let’s do this for Dylan!’ But worse by far was the reaction of Jim Mallinder, the club’s director of rugby. He thought the whole affair was ‘disappointing’. He ‘didn’t think there was any malice in it,’ and he criticised Smith for going down ‘pretty easily’. In summary, he declared: ‘It’s a tough game, and Dylan plays to the edge. You won’t change Dylan. He is competitive.’ He added: ‘I’m not saying that what he did was right.’ Northampton hooker Dylan Hartley wassuspended for three weeks by the RFU for a wild elbow . Hartley's incident came during a flare-up between Northampton and Leicester players during the first half . Hartley's elbow was caught by the Television Match Official who reported the violence to the referee . Such a short statement to contain so much specious tosh! There was the elbow thrown without ‘malice’, the casual defaming of the stricken Smith, the macho garbage about rugby being ‘a tough game’, the acceptance that the player is beyond reform, and that wonderful euphemism ‘competitive’. Belatedly, he realised the ridiculous figure he was cutting and added the risible rider: ‘I’m not saying that what he did was right.’ Now the ‘competitive’ man he was defending has a certain amount of ‘previous’: a 26-week ban for eye-gouging in 2007, eight weeks for biting in 2012, two weeks for punching in the same year, and 11 weeks for verbally abusing a referee in 2013. Hartley now has another three-week ban to add to his wretched tally, the lenient sentence apparently partly due to his plea of guilty. In fairness a not-guilty plea might have provoked laughter in court. No matter. Hartley is now available to play in the Six Nations, if the England coach Stuart Lancaster decides to select him. To his great credit, Lancaster has never lost touch with the grass roots of the game in schools and clubs. He is uncomfortably aware that many parents are deeply concerned about exposing their children to the physical dangers of a sport with an increasingly thuggish reputation. He is also aware that he has a responsibility to the game which far outweighs all other considerations. Lancaster has the chance to fulfil that responsibility by informing Hartley that he has played his last game for England. I dearly hope he takes it.

"Alan Irvine is a diligent and talented football manager who is attempting to succeed on limited resources at West Bromwich. Last week, a bookmaker announced that his chances of being the first Premier League manager to be sacked this season were no better than 6-5. ‘Even as his odds have tumbled, the money has continued to come in for Irvine to go,’ drivelled the hack hired by William Hill to deliver these crass tidings. Nigel Pearson of Leicester is equally industrious, equally capable. His chances of suffering the same fate were assessed at 3-1. Brendan Rodgers of Liverpool, a manager of the first rank, was similarly out of favour after losing to Manchester United last Sunday. Nigel Pearson is short odds to be sacked as manager of Leicester before the end of the season . Alan Irvine (left) watched his West Brom side throw away a two-goal lead to lose 3-2 at Queens Park Rangers . As the bookie’s runner sensitively explained: ‘You’re getting sacked in the morning’ was the song directed at Rodgers by United’s fans, and while it may not be that quick, William Hill offer 6-5 that the Liverpool boss has left Anfield by the end of the season. Following a League Cup win at Bournemouth, Rodgers’ survival prospects moved to a relatively soothing 11–2. Now, the chancers who devise these witless humiliations tend to pass them off as no more than a whimsical flutter, what their charmless trade calls ‘a fun bet’. The fact that they are undermining the dignity of decent professionals is clearly of no concern, since pliant fools will take the gamble and hustlers will accommodate their folly. Clearly there is money to be made from potential unemployment. In any case, it really doesn’t matter, because they’re ‘only’ football managers. But suppose we applied a comparable test to the directors of a company such as William Hill? Who’ll be the first to leave? What about the chairman, Gareth Davis? Before joining Hill’s, Mr Davis spent 38 years serving the public interest at Imperial Tobacco. He has been an enthusiastic 40-a-day puffer, and is now 64 years old. Wheezingly good value at 6-5? Then there’s the chief executive officer, James Henderson, who has worked for Hill’s for almost three decades but was appointed CEO a few months ago. An amply-built Glaswegian, he says: ‘I have a forthright fashion. I am opinionated.’ Survival chance: 3-1 sounds reasonable. Finally, the group finance director, Neil Cooper. This 47-year-old accountant has been with Hill’s for almost five years and, if he has uttered one contentious public statement, then he has kept it well hidden. Sound survival value at 11-2. Brendan Rodgers has come under increasing pressure at Liverpool after a string of poor results . Rodgers' chances of staying at Anfield improved with their win over Bournemouth last week however . Demeaning, is it not? Yet if it’s good enough for widely respected managers, then it’s certainly good enough for a bunch of bookies. Now if all this suggests that football is being heartlessly exploited by betting interests, then the suggestion is quite wrong. For the game positively embraces gambling, to the extent that four Premier League clubs — Aston Villa, Burnley, Hull and Stoke — have their shirts sponsored by gaming companies, while the Championship, League One and League Two carry the title name of Sky Bet. Some will see a certain irony in the fact that last year Hull’s shirt was sponsored by a pay-day lender, before they transferred their allegiance to the firm which offers ‘Asia’s best online sports betting and gambling’. The dangers have been obvious for a long time. Although players are banned from betting on football, a climate has been created in which betting is the natural, inevitable, wholly acceptable partner of the sport. As if the example of international cricket were not sufficient warning, in recent years security experts have told us that match- fixing is ‘endemic’ in football. Yet still the game closes its eyes and ears while selling its shirt and its soul for a bookmaker’s cheque. It is difficult to imagine circumstances which will compel the national sport to face the perils. And so it staggers along its slippery path, its stadiums swimming with seductive odds, its matches punctuated by the uproar of pushers and peddlers. And it is miserably certain, that a truly titanic scandal waits in the wings; no longer a slim possibility, but merely a matter of time. Keegan, the blood lab monster, rips up the darts script . Keegan Brown celebrates his famous victory . Long, long ago, when darts tournaments were conducted in provincial town halls and champions were strangers to national celebrity, I was given the task of interviewing the players. Then, as now, they tended to be stoutly lumbering fellows, with shirt-stretching paunches and insatiable thirsts. They had no illusions that what they were playing had anything to do with ‘sport’. No, it was a pub game: no more, no less. Unfailingly amiable and occasionally incoherent, they would offer standard reflections: ‘Nice game. Good arrows. Can’t hang about, my mate’s got me a pint.’ That last one was always the killer. I had prepared my questions about hopes, fears and ambitions, but nobody ever uttered a single memorable word. The most interesting character was one I encountered in a Suffolk Corn Exchange. A large, ponderous man, he was starting to outline his career plans when he stepped backwards and toppled off the stage. As he lay, stunned, upon the stone floor, his anxious friends surrounded him. One offered him a healing lager, which he seized and sank in a gulp. I looked at my empty notebook and realised I was chasing a lost cause. I could, therefore, imagine the relief today’s darting scribblers must have felt when they encountered Keegan Brown. He is not only a darts player, but also a medical lab assistant in blood services. More, he is named after Kevin Keegan, a family hero. Still more, he defeated John Part, thrice a world champion, in the opening match of the World Darts Championship. But far and above all this was what he said in the moment of victory. ‘If someone had told me I was going to play against a former world champion in the first match on the opening night of the World Championships,’ mused Keegan, ‘I would have ripped their two arms and two legs off. This is what dreams are made of.’ The imagery may be disturbing, but the impact is sensational. After generations of irredeemably dull darts players, we now have a monster from the blood laboratory who dreams of ripping off arms and legs. Keegan Brown is interesting! But where was he when I needed him? PS . Kevin Pietersen played a fine innings of 66 for the Melbourne Stars in the so-called Big Bash in Adelaide. Then, because he is terminally gauche, he announced: ‘Someone told me the England selectors were meeting this morning — I hope they’ve got a screen on.’ The broadcaster Ten Network asked its audience if Pietersen should play for England in next year’s World Cup. Some 72 per cent replied ‘Yes’. Two pertinent facts: (A) This was Pietersen’s first half-century since May — 16 innings ago. (B) Ten Network is an Australian broadcaster and the viewers urging his selection are Australian. Before the usual courtiers swoon clean away, they might pause to wonder if A and B may possibly be connected. PPS . Pietersen celebrated his return to form by scoring just one run in his next innings. Yet still he could tweet to Eoin Morgan: ‘Great news that @Eoin16 is new England 1-day captain. Top player, leader and bloke. Hope I get to play for him’. On reflection, ‘gauche’ is far too kind a term for such unrelenting buffoonery. Kevin Pietersen hit 66 on Thursday but could only manage a solitary run two days later for Melbourne Stars .","Betting companies run books on how likely a manager is to be sacked .

"‘There’s a famous seaside place called Blackpool, that’s noted for fresh air and fun.’ The lines are more than 80 years old, yet still they fix the image of Blackpool in the public mind. No matter that the town has fallen on desperately hard times, Blackpool is fresh air and fun, candyfloss and Kiss Me Quick. And football. A fine club, albeit sadly reduced, like the town whose name it bears, yet still the club of Matthews, Mortensen, gentle Jimmy Armfield. And now, Karl Oyston. Blackpool supporters are calling for chairman Karl Oyston to resign after abusive text messages to fans . Oyston has issued an apology for 'any offence or distress caused by my text responses' Oyston is the chairman of Blackpool, and among certain affluent circles up there on the Fylde Coast, he cuts a mighty figure. He has money, a robust sense of his own importance, and trenchant opinions, the most recent of which have been directed at a Blackpool supporter named Steve Smith. Now I suspect that Mr Smith is not an especially engaging individual, and the text messages he sent to the chairman may well have been provocative. But consider Oyston’s responses. ‘Are you sure we’ve met?’ asks Oyston. ‘I would have remembered such a massive retard.’ He calls him ‘an intellectual cripple’ and tells him to ‘enjoy the rest of your special needs day out’. He adds: ‘Stop texting f******, you shouldn’t have ever started as you are one tiresome f***** that should spot trains not watch football. Get a life and consider yourself banned from the stadium.’ There is more in similar vein, but you get the drift. Blackpool president Valeri Belokon is unhappy with the running of the club and called for Oyston to resign . Oyston's insults revealed a lot about his character . Now we need not speculate about the kind of mind which could conjure up phrases like ‘retard’ and ‘cripple’, or use ‘special needs’ as a spiteful slur. Such are Oyston’s poisonous views, and he is welcome to them. But those opinions carry a much wider significance than the trumpeting of a minor clown. For in his own town, he is seen as the face of his club. Far more disturbingly, he is a member of the board of the Football League, a body with considerable power and influence. In other words, at a time when football at large is making commendable efforts to improve its image and enhance its credibility, a man like Karl Oyston retains a voice in the governance of the national game. Oyston’s reaction to the publication of the texts was entirely predictable. He made a self-serving apology — ‘I regret stooping to the level of those threatening and abusing my family’ — and he announced he would be making a donation to Blackpool’s Community Trust, which works with organisations supporting disabled people. Money solves everything, you see; fill a few pockets and people forget. The calculation is as obvious as it is abhorrent. In fact, the Oyston family have a great deal of money, much of it deriving from their association with Blackpool FC. Blackpool fans gather outside the stadium to voice their displeasure at the situation at the club . The most outrageous example was revealed in these pages by my colleague Nick Harris. Following the club’s sole season in the Premier League in 2010-11, Owen Oyston, the chairman’s father and Blackpool’s majority shareholder, was paid £11million. As Harris pointed out, this was considerably more than the wage bill for the first-team squad and manager combined. Such grotesque largesse would have been unacceptable had Blackpool enjoyed some success. In fact, they were relegated. The club emerged with some £40m from that season, but miserably little was spent on improving the team. Instead, players were allowed to leave in droves, while replacements were sought in the bargain basement. A week before the start of the current season, the club employed just eight fully-fledged professional footballers. In that same week, I attended a friendly with Burnley. The pre-match announcer declared: ‘The Seasiders team will be: Number One, Trialist … Number Three, Trialist …’ And so on. Later, when the substitutes started to arrive, they were identified as, respectively: ‘Number 15, Number 14, Numbers 13 and 16, and finally, Number 17.’ It was like some dark pantomime, an extended practical joke. Before a ball was kicked, the bookmakers declared them odds-on favourites to be relegated. Chris Maguire scores the only goal of the game as Sheffield Wednesday beat Blackpool on Boxing Day . Blackpool, under Oyston's guidance, are seven points adrift at the bottom of the Championship . The current Championship table tells its own story. And all this has happened under the regime of the Oystons; the convicted rapist of a father and his odiously offensive son. Yet I fancy they know that the game is up, that they have known it since Tuesday evening, when their shirt sponsors Wonga said of Karl’s texts: ‘The comments were unacceptable, something we’ll be making clear to the club.’ A lecture on morality from a legalised loan shark, there can be no more humiliating chastisement. The next moves are already taking shape. As custodian of the game’s values, the Football Association are investigating with a view to taking the strongest measures available to them. Given the nature of the offence, the Football League will come under pressure to remove Oyston Junior from their board at the earliest opportunity. And after such shows of disapproval, the hope must be that a decent football club finds a way of ridding itself of its current owners. Their departure will come not a moment too soon. For that seaside place of fresh air and fun deserves very much better than its obnoxious Oystons. PS . Christmas brings out the eloquence in football managers, and 2014 proved a vintage year. Thus the perceptive Alan Pardew reflected on Newcastle conceding three goals at Old Trafford: ‘We need to defend better than we did today.’ And the equally astute Mark Warburton, after Brentford were battered by Ipswich: ‘You can’t go three down to teams of that quality.’ But the public speaking prize goes to our old favourite Stuart Pearce, following Forest’s beating at Middlesbrough. Effortlessly combining two evergreen clichés, he mused: ‘At this moment in time as a club, we’re shooting ourselves in the foot.’ Happy New Year.","Blackpool chairman Karl Oyston sent abusive text messages to a fan .

"The great ones leave the deepest memories; we recall John McEnroe unfolding a cross-court backhand or Brian Lara persuading a languid late cut between slip and gully, each stroke a small miracle of timing and imagination. At their best, they seemed to be playing a different game from the rest. Then, quite suddenly, the magic dissolved and they became human once again. As he approaches his 39th birthday, Tiger Woods may be undergoing that same, sombre transformation. Tiger Woods has struggled desperately for form over the past couple of years as he combats injuries . Woods was sick and is in last place heading into the final round of his comeback tournament . His summer form was woeful, having returned too soon from back surgery. He missed the cut five times in eight tournaments, and retreated to rehabilitation in August. But the start of his comeback in Isleworth, Florida, on Thursday was an extended nightmare. It started with a tee shot hooked into a neighbouring swimming pool, featured a smattering of stubbed chips, and ended 77 shots later. He was furious, of course, and seethingly frustrated to have finished the opening day in last place, four shots behind the field. The 38-year-old has struggled throughout the tournament as he looked to re-capture his once dominant form . But that is his form, and his only answer is to work harder, concentrate more fiercely and pray that the game which once came so naturally will cease to resemble an impenetrable mystery. As for the rest of us, it does no harm to remember just how stunning his golf used to be, and the cavalier fashion in which his victories were achieved. For a time - indeed, for a long time - he appeared almost invincible. The statistics tell their own tale: four Masters, four US PGAs, three US Opens and three Open Championships for a total of 14 majors. At his dazzling peak, he was quite untouchable. But the game, just like every game, has a way of taking its revenge, and now he struggles like a mortal where once he strutted like a god. Yet here’s the strangest thing: in his travails, Tiger Woods seems more sympathetic, more human, somehow more admirable than ever he did when the living was easy, and glory followed him down every fairway. Woods has won 14 majors during his career, including the US Open at Pebble Beach in 2000 (pictured)","Tiger Woods has won 14 majors in an illustrious golfing career to date .

"Black Friday, the day after Thanksgiving, is recognised as the launching pad for the Christmas shopping season. It signifies an eruption of frantic excess, breathless extravagance and uncontrolled spending. This year, by happy coincidence, it was also the day on which the Premier League published details of the money which each club handed to football agents in the previous 12 months. In 2012, the leeches pocketed £77,003,130 in fees, and the amount provoked a degree of outrage. Last year, their pickings had risen to £96,673,089, and ‘monstrous’ was one of the favoured descriptions. We suspected that the year ending September 30, 2014, would break the nine-figure barrier, and our suspicions were well founded. Manchester United spent big in the summer on the likes of Angel di Maria  but not on agents' fees . These sharp-suited, self-seeking, utterly superfluous hustlers extracted a total of £115,261,136 from the national sport. And gave it precious little in return. The headline figures are mind-numbing. Chelsea were top of the pile with a staggering £16,771,328 slice of their resident oligarch’s fortune. Liverpool distributed £14,308,444 of John W Henry’s New England bounty. Manchester City’s sheik, the chap with the bottomless purse, weighed in with £12,811,946. And the relentlessly unsuccessful Tottenham discovered £10,983,011 in their reclusive patron’s back pocket. By comparison, Manchester United (£7,975,556) were a model of moderation, while even West Ham’s £6,380,339 looks a shade less offensive than it did at first sight. Chelsea spent £32 million on Spain striker Diego Costa in the summer . No matter, the point is that 20 football clubs have passed over £115.2m which the game will never see again. It will purchase second homes, private education, exotic holidays and impossibly opulent motor cars for the aforementioned agents, but the game which generated those funds will receive not a penny. Now you might think it impossible to make this unacceptable situation even worse, but the Premier League seem to have worked the trick. In a helpful explanation attached to these financial details, they explain: ‘The amounts shown include payments made by clubs on behalf of players.’ So the clubs have paid the fees which the players owe to their agents. Effectively, they have rewarded agents for negotiating against them! It is quite beyond reason or belief. When actors, authors or international sports people want to sell their services, they hire an agent to secure the best possible deal. In return, they pay that agent an agreed fee. They do not expect their prospective employers to meet the bill, since they live in the real world. Yet football exists not only on a different planet, but in a different galaxy. Agent Jorge Mendes (left) was involved in Radamel Falcao, Di Maria and Diego Costa deals . The clear winner in this year’s agents’ handicap was the indefatigable Jorge Mendes, whose portfolio includes Radamel Falcao and Angel di Maria to Manchester United, Diego Costa to Chelsea and Eliaquim Mangala to Manchester City. Estimates of Mendes’ cut begin at £20m and keep climbing. No doubt he possesses a certain talent, but it is not one which causes the football public to drool. We are not discussing the equivalent of Cristiano Ronaldo (who happens to be another Mendes client). No, Mendes is merely an agent, and he and his chums do a job which could be done equally well — and for a fraction of the fee — by an accountant and a lawyer. Any other business might find that incredibly strange, even alarming. But football simply shrugs and chuckles and waits for the next burst of bank notes, which it will use to stuff the pockets of players, managers and agents. Some would suggest it might more equitably be employed in reducing the cost of season tickets, programmes, even half-time tea and pies. Not a chance. It simply never crosses the minds of those who take such decisions. For football speaks the language of priorities, and its priority is to lavish its largesse upon those who are the least worthy of reward. Thus the ranks of pestilential chancers take home £115,261,136, and nobody charged with running the game seems to think it scandalous. On reflection, I was quite unfair to Black Friday. When set alongside the brazen profiteering of football agents, it was a model of frugal restraint. Taxi for Mellor...he still fails to cut the mustard . Listeners to BBC radio sport in the 90s will recall the moment at six minutes past six on Saturday evenings, when a tune would blare and a plumply over-elocuted voice would begin to bluster. David Mellor was putting football to rights. His opinions were forceful, provocative and totally untainted by knowledge; this team wasn’t ‘doing the business’, that player wasn’t ‘cutting the mustard’, these managers were ‘tactically naive’. David Mellor said he is 'really, really sorry' for his verbal abuse of a London cab driver last week . We were reprieved for a few weeks in 1997 when he went to defend his Parliamentary seat. The electors of Putney emphatically rejected him. And so, at 6.06 on Saturday evening, we were greeted with: ‘Hello again! Just when you thought it was safe to go back to the airwaves, I’m back!’ Many people seemed to dismiss him as a harmless impostor who was using football to seek street credibility. But others perceived an edge of real nastiness in his sweeping, scornful judgments and glasses were raised when he left the programme. Yet we wondered if memory was playing tricks. Was he really as awful as we believed? The answer arrived last week, in that tape of our hero’s altercation with a London taxi driver. ‘You’ve been driving a cab for 10 years, I’ve been in the Cabinet, I’m an award-winning broadcaster, I’m a Queen’s Counsel. ‘You think your experiences are anything compared to mine? I don’t want a lot of backchat, I don’t want to know how much you know about London because you don’t know as much about London as I do. Because you think you’re a big s***, having driven a cab for 10 years, you don’t need to worry about someone who has been in the Cabinet, who’s an award-winning broadcaster, who’s a Queen’s Counsel. If you think you’re going to be sarky with me, get a better education. Do you get any of this, my little friend?’ That was our Dave, still ‘doing the business’, still ‘cutting the mustard’. One of a kind, they say. Let us hope they’re right. Question time just pointless with Sky . With the heedless courage of men unafraid of appearing ridiculous, the Wales Rugby Union have complained to the BBC. Their target is the Corporation’s immensely capable and experienced reporter Sonja McLaughlan. Before the match with New Zealand last weekend, she asked Wales coach Warren Gatland if the ritual of the Haka gave the All Blacks an unfair advantage. Wales Rugby Union have complained to the BBC about questioning of Wales coach Warren Gatland . Later, she wondered if Gatland felt under any pressure, after 22 consecutive defeats against the Southern Hemisphere nations. And that is all it takes to upset the WRU: two perfectly reasonable questions which invite intelligent responses. You see, our major sports don’t expect that sort of thing from TV people. Of course, newspaper reporters are different; truculent oiks with dark agendas who take pleasure in embarrassing the great and the good. But TV usually knows how to behave. After paying huge sums to acquire ‘the product’, they are normally at pains to protect their investment. So players, coaches, even seat-warming directors, must be approached on bended knee. Sky Sports wrote the textbook on this one. Having stumped up the earth for the Premier League, they have apparently decided post-match interviews must be conducted this way. Thus, after Tottenham’s recent victory at Hull, Christian Eriksen was squirmingly asked: ‘How much did you enjoy that winner, Christian?’ Christian said he had enjoyed it a lot. It was faintly demeaning, wholly unrevealing and utterly pointless. And it demonstrated precisely why Sonja McLaughlan doesn’t work for Sky. P.S. The tributes arrived in a deep swell of sympathy for the farmer’s son, taken in the full bloom of youth. The death of a fine cricketer evoked the grief of friends and the distress of strangers. Yet even as we curse the cruel mischance which cut him down, we celebrate a rare and memorable talent. Phillip Hughes departed far too early, but he had left his mark upon his country and upon his sport. We mourn his passing.","Chelsea paid a staggering £16,771,328 in fees to agents in 12 months .

"There was a hum of mutinous muttering as they trooped out of the Emirates on Saturday night. No strident protest, no outright rebellion, nothing so crude; but the frustration, the discontent were all too evident. It was best expressed at Arsene Wenger’s press conference, when an earnest scribbler began: ‘Arsene: dominating teams and not finishing them off. Is it a case of deja vu?’ A pause: ‘Of course, you’ll know what that means.’ For half a second, the manager’s post-match face hovered on the brink of a smile. But the summary had been perfectly accurate. Having fashioned sufficient chances in the first 25 minutes to have won half a dozen matches, Arsenal frittered them one by one. The Emirates sensed a penalty would be paid, and they were right. Arsenal's Kieran Gibbs (left) and Santi Cazorla look dejected after their 2-1 defeat against Manchester United . The result heaps pressure on boss Arsene Wenger as his side could have won the match inside the first half . United were second best at pretty well everything, save the one virtue which counts for more than all the others. Wayne Rooney demonstrated it to clinical perfection. Rooney spent 85 minutes watching some of the most expensive attackers in English football miss chance upon chance. Then, with United breaking at pace and the Arsenal defence suicidally stretched, he accelerated on to a pass, changed from foot to foot, and raised a delicate chip beyond the goalkeeper. As lessons go, it was utterly emphatic. Yet Rooney knew, Arsenal knew, everybody in this part of North London knew that Arsenal should have been home and hosed before United had even raised their voice. But the chest-thumping chants of United’s travelling circus told their own story. United were installed in the top four, while what might have been a night of solid Arsenal advancement became a slow decline into upper mid-table. Wayne Rooney (right) scored Manchester United's second goal in their 2-1 win at Arsenal . United captain Rooney celebrates scoring his side's second in their victory on Saturday night . Louis van Gaal was another manager who almost cracked a smile; with good reason. But United’s manager is a serious man, who delivers his messages with the controlled frenzy of a revivalist preacher. Random words are barked in mid-sentence, startling the sleepy with their passion: ‘When we KEEP! The ball, when we SHOW! Confidence, then we create big chances,’ he boomed. One imagines he might be a revelation at half-time. But he was honest enough to admit: ‘If Arsenal had scored in the first 20 minutes, then it is another game.’ We went into the match aware that both clubs have known better days. Time was when they debated the glittering prizes, now they tend to know their place; a couple of dowagers, squabbling over the dinner service while the men with new money make off with the deeds to the castle. Attacking talent fairly flooded the field; Danny Welbeck, Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and Jack Wilshere on one side, Wayne Rooney, Robin van Persie and Angel di Maria on the other. But, by comparison, the defences were accidents waiting to happen. Arsenal have long toiled to accommodate their suspect central defenders, but United’s injury list has pushed players like Paddy McNair and Tyler Blackett into situations which ideally would have been long delayed. United boss Louis van Gaal watched the first half pensively as Arsenal dominated the opening exchanges . Arsenal striker Danny Welbeck (left) spurned a great chance when his shot was blocked by Paddy McNair . As they struggled through those early anxieties, Van Gaal sat in his dugout, looking inscrutable. The assumption used to be that he was thinking profound thoughts. Now, nobody is quite so sure. But, as he would later point out, the result is the starting point of all the inquests. Arsenal were dazzling in that early passage. Their pace was bewildering, their passing inspired, and all the doubts which United’s defenders were clearly nourishing came crowding remorselessly in. Oxlade-Chamberlain was virtually unplayable. But the finishing; ah, the finishing! Welbeck was profligate, Oxlade-Chamberlain careless, while Wilshere treated his chances with the extravagance of a lottery winner in a casino. And as they wasted chance upon chance, United sensed that there were points of their own to be made. After half an hour, the match produced a revealing cameo. With a scrappy challenge, Wilshere provoked a sadly unequal spat with Marouane Fellaini. As the United player reacted, Wilshere thrust his head towards his opponent’s face, twice. Had the big man been in theatrical mood, then Arsenal would unquestionably, and needlessly, have been reduced to 10. Jack Wilshere (right) was lucky not to be sent off after appearing to headbutt Marouane Fellaini . Wilshere brings many qualities to this team, but there is a truculent self-indulgence which threatens to prevent his becoming the kind of player he ought to be. By now, Rooney was more influential, Fellaini was an imposing target, while Di Maria cannot be subdued for half a match. You could almost touch the apprehension and Wilshere’s departure increased that tension. He made a truly forlorn spectacle as he limped away, and you wondered how his team would cope without his creativity. Within a minute, the first United goal provided the answer. We sensed it would not be Arsenal’s night, and they started to play as if they knew it. The chance still cropped up, but there was an absence of conviction, optimism, all those qualities which teams at the top tend to take for granted. As United flourished, Arsenal feared there was even worse ahead. And they were absolutely right. Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain (centre) was guilty of careless finishing as Arsenal missed several opportunities .","Manchester United won 2-1 away at Arsenal on Saturday night .

"The cynics insist we should never feel sorry for a coach with a long-term contract. It is a fine theory, but it did not survive the sight of Stuart Lancaster’s face on Saturday night. Pale, drawn, faintly desperate, he looked like a man who sees a wretched row of sleepless nights stretching before him. He was correct and courteous, since that is his nature. He was impeccably loyal to his team, since that is his obligation. But after England’s fifth defeat in succession, he knew precisely what Twickenham Man was saying as the first pints went down. And he knew he would not emerge well from the beery inquest. He clutched at the ‘positives’, aware that the word itself rang emptily after this latest reversal. He said he was ‘frustrated to have got so close’. He said that England had ‘enjoyed a lot of ball’, they had ‘generated good momentum’ in the second half, they had ‘played a lot of constructive rugby’. And that was about it. South Africa celebrate the only try of the first half which came from an intercept by Jan Serfontein . England coach Stuart Lancaster defended his team after they suffered their fifth straight defeat . Of more consequence were his more reflective observations. He said he had ‘learned about who can and who can’t deliver’ and repeatedly he stressed the need for England to be ‘smarter’, especially if they ever hope to beat the likes of New Zealand and South Africa, ‘the top two sides in the world’. No coach enjoys facing the world after a string of defeats, and Lancaster is no exception. He knows that the pressure on him will certainly increase in the 11 months or so before the Rugby World Cup. And, deep down and unspoken, he must suspect that his squad has not improved; indeed, it may even have deteriorated. Expectations will be great, because they always are, but the notion that England might finish at the top of the heap seems thoroughly fanciful at the moment. England assembled the kind of performance which pushes the sanest coaches towards neurosis. Careless to the point of sloppiness, with shoddy handling and sterile strategy, they frequently resembled those England sides of old, who rejected wit and creation in favour of the muscularity of the night-club bouncer. Springboks centre Jan Serfontein runs away for the first try after intercepting the pass of Danny Care . A week ago against New Zealand, albeit in defeat, they did sufficient to provide the encouragement of which Lancaster spoke. On Saturday, the mood had evaporated. The Twickenham crowd traditionally waits for the home side to deserve its support. On Saturday, it withheld it until the cause was effectively lost. Until then, Twickenham Man had been diverted by extraneous issues. Why do they think it necessary to flood the field with soldiers, sailors and airmen? I counted 61 service personnel in the pre-match ceremonies on Saturday, but there could have been more. This was, after all, an autumn international, not the Royal Tournament. And why do they make poor Laura Wright sing the national anthem wearing a flimsy, red evening gown in the chill November drizzle? The distractions were understandable. The All Blacks game was conducted against a background of seething excitement. On Saturday, the mood was listless, slumberous, vapid. South Africa were no better than they had to be; similarly muscular in approach, but constructing counter-attacks with real speed and invention, and finishing them without mercy. And whenever the Boks felt themselves under threat, they could usually rely upon an English handing error - all too often from Billy Vunipola - to provide their relief. England captain Chris Robshaw looked devastated after the final whistle as England were beaten again . The try they organised at the start of the second half was, by some distance, the best thing in the entire game. There was Pat Lambie’s elegant chip beyond English cover, there was Willie le Roux, striding on to clutch the ball from the air and making swiftly adequate ground, there was his subtle off-load to Cobus Reinach, and there was the controlled sprint to the line, culminating in a sprawl without a white shirt in sight. It was quite glorious, and the fact that it carried them to a 20-6 advantage seemed to have concluded the argument. It was here that England found what slender satisfaction they could take from the match. The rumbling, rolling drives made immoderate, unstoppable yardage, and with first David Wilson, then Ben Morgan taking their tries, an unlikely equality was achieved. But the flame was quickly extinguished, helped in no small measure by the crudely destructive impulse of England’s hooker Dylan Hartley. South Africa came out on top 31-28 at Twickenham on Saturday to inflict another defeat on England . He appeared to consider carefully the position of his feet when Duane Vermeulen lay on the floor. Hartley stamped down on the No 8’s knee, and then had the nerve to shake his head when he was packed off with a yellow card. Lancaster would mention lapses of discipline. Hartley should be in no doubt about the coach’s target. England finished with earnest endeavour. They showed their expected character, but the Springboks showed class, lifting their game just as New Zealand had done. It was enough to come through, by a tiny margin yet with something to spare. And Lancaster was left to speak of the ‘learning process’, to stress once more that England had just played the two best teams they could find, and to promise changes for Samoa next week. He would not have thanked us for our sympathy, but he had it just the same.","England lost 31-28 to South Africa at Twickenham on Saturday .

"For all its wealth and influence, football suffers from a host of self-made problems. Yet the national game offers many more reasons to celebrate than to curse. Which is something to remember when we contemplate the misadventures of the bewildered clown named Dave Whelan. By now, we can almost recite his odious stereotyping: ‘Do you think Jewish people chase money a little bit more than we do?... It’s telling the truth. Jewish people love money... If any Englishman said he has never called a Chinaman a chink he is lying... There’s a big difference if you criticise a black person because that is something I would never ever do or agree to. I would never even dream of that... I go to Barbados a lot.’ It is the kind of grotesque drivel which renders satire redundant. And it faithfully echoes the attitudes of the man whom Whelan appointed to manage Wigan Athletic. For by now we have become wretchedly acquainted with the musings of Malky Mackay. Dave Whelan (right) and new Wigan boss Malky Mackay are of one mind . On a South Korean footballer: ‘*** chinkys. ** it. There’s enough dogs in Cardiff for us all to go around.’ On the football agent Phil Smith: ‘Go on, fat Phil. Nothing like a Jew that sees money slipping through his fingers.’ On a football official: ‘He’s a snake, a gay snake. Not to be trusted.’ On a female agent: ‘I hope she’s looking after your needs. I bet you’d love a bounce on her falsies.’ All this, plus the distribution of a picture entitled ‘Black Monopoly’, with every square marked ‘Go To Jail’. The episode has erupted at a turbulent time, when the game is distracted by issues ranging from FIFA corruption, to Ched Evans, to the re-emergence of a hard-right strand among England supporters. And it embodies the attitude which insists that football is entitled to live by its own standards, regardless of the views of the outside world. Thus, Mackay can send messages to a chum at another club, in the knowledge that they hold common assumptions about Jews, foreigners, women and gays. The fact that non-football people might find such views grossly offensive has clearly never crossed his mind. You see, we’re all lads together here. Nudge-nudge, wink-wink, quality banter. Yet this is the character Whelan chose to manage his club, on the extraordinary grounds that ‘what he’s done is so tiny, really... It’s not all that serious when you read it.’ And he awarded him the job in the full knowledge that the FA were inquiring into Mackay’s behaviour. Mackay patrols the touchline on his return to football, despite being under investigation from the FA . Imagine somebody applying for a post as the manager of one of Whelan’s sports shops and admitting that the authorities were still inquiring into his previous conduct. Would Whelan say: ‘Not a problem, son. Come right in. The job’s yours.’? Of course not. But he can do precisely that at Wigan, because it doesn’t really count. It’s only football. Crystal Palace behaved quite differently. They were in the process of offering Mackay a position at Selhurst Park, but negotiations were swiftly broken off when the sexist, racist, homophobic revelations appeared. Are the people who run Palace more principled than those who run Wigan? It would seem so. Football’s freemasonry being what it is, both Whelan and Mackay found support within the game. One Premier League manager declared Whelan ‘a good man’, and said of Mackay: ‘It’s easy to kick someone when they’re down... If he does it again, he’s gonna be in trouble, but I’m sure he’s learned from that. He’s made a big mistake, the lad.’ If Harry Redknapp is the best advocate Whelan and Mackay can find, then their cause may well be hopeless. Mackay still seems incapable of appreciating the offence he has given. ‘I’m a big man,’ he said, as he took up his new job. ‘I would ask people to judge me as they see me. I made mistakes but I’m absolutely not racist. I hope going forward the people of Wigan see me as I am.’ Sportsmail revealed the 'racist, homophobic and sexist' texts and emails by Mackay and Iain Moody (left) The people of Wigan may do just that, and he may not care for their conclusions. As for Whelan, he simply blunders on; a contemptible figure whose image degenerates each time he opens his mouth. Some have tried to excuse him on the grounds that he is an old man who comes from a different, more bigoted era. But he has been talking offensive nonsense for a number of years now, and he shows no signs of changing. He clearly doesn’t believe that Mackay has done anything particularly untoward, and in Whelan’s world, he probably hasn’t. For this is football, where such attitudes are condoned and tolerated, sometimes even celebrated. Yet, by the week’s end, even Whelan seemed to tire of his own prattling. He is aware of the FA investigations into the affair, but he affects an airy indifference. ‘I don’t think there is anything really to investigate’, he says. ‘I just want to get on with the great game.’ The FA may have other ideas; if so, they would be widely supported. For the football people of Wigan deserve rather better than Dave Whelan and Malky Mackay. And so does the national sport. Ched posturing absurd . Many are split over Ched Evans' future . Some believe that the rapist Ched Evans should once again be allowed to train with his club. Others, this column included, contend his offence was so grave that he should find no immediate place in professional sport. Both arguments have much to commend them but people must adopt one or the other, or risk appearing ridiculous. Which brings us to Jim Phipps, the co-chairman of Sheffield United. Speaking after his club had withdrawn training facilities from Evans, he said: ‘I’m angry that we are not able to get a chance to do for this footballer what should be done. The influence of mob-like behaviour has made it difficult to take the simple step of allowing Ched to train. Ched was convicted and has served his sentence. ‘He now has a right and an obligation to go about making a livelihood.’ All of which is admirably high-sounding and thoroughly misleading. Evans has served only the custodial portion of his five-year sentence. He is now paroled under licence conditions. But if Sheffield United wanted him to resume training and ultimately playing, then they would be entitled to make that judgement. And if they recognise his ‘right and obligation’ to resume his livelihood, they have only to say the word. The fact is, they are afraid to take those steps because they know they will prove unpopular. And so their co-chairman pretends they had no choice. It is absurd. Few people can claim credit from the Evans affair. After the posturing of Phipps, Sheffield United can claim less than most. Sheffield United co-chairman Jim Phipps speaks to the assembled media this week about Evans . Silence is sweet music . In a good few years of watching sport, I have yet to meet a fan who bought a ticket to look at the audience. When people pay for a sports event, they do so in order to observe the players. This simple truth is something which escapes certain groups: cricket’s so-called Barmy Army, for instance, or that dreadful band whose dreary thumping forms the background to far too many England football matches. Certain English cricket grounds have evolved ways of dealing with the attention-seeking ‘Barmies’, by refusing entry on the grounds that they make life hell for anybody within hearing distance. The Barmy Army in action during England's successful Ashes tour three years ago . Yet at least their songs are largely inoffensive. The characters who have latched on to English football’s band are a different matter. Personally, I have always believed that anybody who turns up carrying a musical instrument should be turned away. This would deny us endless, artless repetitions of the national anthem, or Jerusalem or, God help us, The Great Escape. But we could live with that. For it would also deny some unsavoury individuals the chance to infect sport with crass slogans, by bawling anti-IRA chants and singing provocative songs. In Glasgow the other evening, an FA official was obliged to ask the band to stop playing, since their ‘music’ was unwittingly fuelling certain sectarian anthems. They instantly complied and the silence was golden. With luck, it will never be broken. PS . The New Zealand haka — the pre-match war dance performed by the All Blacks — was one of those strangely endearing cultural traditions which was always watched with respect by opponents and spectators. Then we were told that somehow it gave New Zealand an unfair advantage. At the recent Twickenham international, the home crowd drowned the haka with wave after boorish wave of Sweet Chariot. So it was good to hear the Wales wing George North speak up for tradition before Saturday’s international. Richie McCaw leads the New Zealand players as they perform the haka at the Millennium Stadium . ‘I can’t wait to face the haka again,’ he said. ‘It’s supposed to be intimidating, but if you can’t handle it, then you’re probably not going to be able to manage a game of international rugby either’. Absolutely. Long may it continue.","Mackay can send messages to a chum at another club, in the knowledge that they hold common assumptions about Jews, foreigners, women and gays .

"Moral stature: Jessica Ennis-Hill said Ched Evans should not be re-signed by Sheffield United because football players should 'set a good example' Jessica Ennis-Hill is a remarkable woman. She is the reigning Olympic heptathlon champion and the finest all-round female athlete this country has produced. And in a glittering international career spanning a decade, she has never uttered a contentious word nor expressed a controversial opinion. Until last week that is, when she announced that she wanted her name removed from a stand named after her by Sheffield United, if the club offers a contract to the convicted rapist Ched Evans. ‘Those in positions of influence should respect the role they play in young people’s lives and set a good example,’ she said. ‘If Evans was to be re-signed by the club it would completely contradict these beliefs.’ The view was simply stated, yet the effect was devastating. In the space of two sentences, she seemed to have ended all speculation that the rapist would be allowed to carry on collecting £20,000 a week for playing professional football in Sheffield. Evans was released from prison in October, having served two-and-a-half years of a five-year sentence for raping an intoxicated 19-year-old woman. His victim, whose identity was revealed on social media, has suffered vicious abuse, has been forced to leave her home town, and change her identity. More than 157,000 people signed a petition urging the club not to take back the player. Now, if Evans had been a mundane performer, then he would have been sacked with a great show of lofty disapproval. But he is not mundane – he is their star, a man who is worth a lot of money. So the club did nothing, and waited for the initial storm to abate. They then, discreetly, allowed him to resume training. There were strong arguments on both sides. Many believed Evans had served his time and should be allowed to resume his profession; others thought his offence too heinous for easy forgiveness, and cited the fact that he had shown neither a scrap of remorse for his offence, nor sympathy for his victim. But Jessica’s intervention may well prove decisive, for she enjoys the moral stature of one who represents something decent in sport and in society. Football can make no such claim. Pretentiously, it calls itself ‘the beautiful game’. Rarely can beauty have seemed so morally repugnant. Ched Evans served half of his five-year jail term for raping an intoxicated 19-year-old woman . The popular cliche suggests the game is played by a posse of sexual predators, managed by a gaggle of garrulous chancers and controlled by owners whose financial backgrounds might not withstand intensive scrutiny. It is an exaggeration, but it contains an element of truth. Awash with money at its higher levels, football has developed a disturbing sense of entitlement. ‘I want, I can afford, therefore I must have’ is the mantra. The statistics are startling. The average Premier League player’s salary is £2.3million per year. These physically gifted, sparsely educated men earn almost 60 per cent more than their contemporaries in Germany, home of the current world champions. Star players at clubs such as Manchester United, Manchester City and Chelsea are paid between £4million and £5million a year. But then the Premier League clubs pick up an average of £155million per season from a £1billion a year television contract, as well as the massive overseas rights. Most of this finds its way back to the players, which is as it should be. Far less palatable is the largesse skimmed off by agents – odious leeches who contribute little to the game yet plundered almost £97million last year. Ennis-Hill said she wanted her name removed from the stand at Bramall Lane if Evans was re-signed . Time was when clubs were owned by landed gentry or local businessmen who’d made their pile and wanted to make their mark. Today it’s oil-rich sheiks or oligarchs with fortunes of mysterious provenance. All has changed, and the general sense of opulence now extends even to the boardroom of the Football Association. In the summer, at the World Cup in Brazil, the FA chairman Greg Dyke was presented with a gift bag by the Brazilian FA. He brought it home and left it in a corner of his study. He was later informed it contained a £16,400 Parmigiani watch. Dyke was shocked, and confessed he had received half a dozen watches in his year at the FA. Mercifully, the era of racial or homophobic insults is fading, but the raucous filth of the chanting is something which continues to shock. I recall Harry Redknapp, when manager of Spurs, enduring a disgraceful afternoon at Villa Park. Redknapp, who is not an unworldly man, later spoke with disgust at the insults which players and managers are required to endure from foul-mouthed dullards. Despite bid leaders knowing England did not stand a chance of being given hosting rights for the 2018 World Cup, Prince William, David Beckham and David Cameron were sent to FIFA headquarters in Zurich . ‘And some of them have their children with them,’ he said. ‘Young kids, watching their fathers make those evil gestures and scream those words. If they did it in the street, they’d be arrested. Why should football grounds be different?’ Last week’s revelations from FIFA on the report into corruption were unquestionably damaging to the game’s tainted image, yet the prevailing reaction was of scorn. World football’s governing body is institutionally unscrupulous, so much so that it scarcely troubles to deny the fact. It is also miserably incompetent. Thus it could commission an investigation into the scandal of the World Cup bidding process for the 2018 and 2022 tournaments, and then, when the probe failed to deliver the required whitewash, order a ‘precis’ of the report which flatly contradicted the original document. But the English FA had no cause for disdain, following the spectacular shambles of its own 2010 World Cup bid, when trumpets were sounded and the starry trio of Prince William, David Beckham and David Cameron were dispatched to Zurich to help plead the English cause. Privately, as some of us had discovered, the bid leaders knew beyond doubt that England hadn’t the remotest chance of success. But that didn’t stop the FA’s shameless wooing of disgraced FIFA executive Jack Warner, with a job offer for one of his pals and a £35,000 dinner that sticks in the craw. And they allowed the prince, the PM and the nation’s favourite son to humiliate themselves by seeking votes from the rascals. It was a repellent spectacle. And yet, at its best, football has much to offer. It can captivate and beguile. It can enthuse the young, enthral the old and ignite the imagination of those who have followed it so faithfully. But the sad old game has not been at its best for some time. It was never so wealthy, never so widely watched, yet never so little loved. Desperately, it seeks a clear, resonant voice, one which articulates the values it used to embrace. And last week it gained such a voice in Jessica Ennis-Hill. We must hope it finds the wit to listen.","Jessica Ennis-Hill asked for her name to be removed from a stand at Bramall Lane if Sheffield United re-sign convicted rapist Ched Evans .

"Almost 35 years have passed since I tried to exchange sterling for roubles at the reception desk of a Moscow hotel. It was a modest sum, about £30, but the receptionist became agitated. ‘Don’t change here!’ she whispered. ‘We pay only the official rate.’ ‘Where, then?’ I asked. She pointed across the lobby at a figure in a sombre green jacket, with stiff-brimmed cap and face blank as an empty soup plate. ‘Him!’ she said. ‘He pays six times the rate.’ She reached for my notes, and hurried across to the militia man. They held a brief conversation, the transaction was made, and she returned, smiling. ‘He asked me where you are from, and I told him Britain,’ she said. ‘He said he likes British, so he gave me seven times.’ FIFA president Sepp Blatter announces Qatar as the hosts for the 2022 World Cup in December 2010 . Sepp Blatter (right) hands the World Cup to Qatar’s Sheik Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani . She picked out her own, modest, commission, and handed me a bundle of roubles. The deed was done. It was all perfectly open; nobody reacted, nobody seemed to care. That was the way life was lived in Soviet Russia. I repeated the performance three or four times over the period of the Moscow Olympics. The man would nod to me as I walked through the foyer; occasionally he would pat the wallet in his inside pocket. I told myself that, while illegal, it was harmless, a victimless crime which everybody committed. It was several weeks later, when the Olympics were over and I was back home, that the doubts started to crowd in. Of course Russian society was hopelessly corrupt from top to bottom. But through my complicity in that tacky deception, hadn’t I helped to make it a little more squalid? Which brings us, quite naturally, to England’s hapless bid to stage the 2018 World Cup. In this column on December 5, 2010 - three days after the humiliating vote - I related details of a private dinner party I had attended in a Mayfair hotel. The dinner had taken place 11 months earlier, and guests included senior civil servants, three or four journalists, and leading members of the England World Cup 2018 bid team. David Beckham shakes hands with Blatter and hands over England's ill-fated World Cup 2018 bid book . After the meal, the bid’s chief executive, Andy Anson, was asked about rumours of corruption among the FIFA executive committee who would choose the host nation. To general amazement, he told us that the matter had been given a great deal of thought, and he and his team had concluded that, of the 24 voting members, ‘at least 13 are buyable’. It was a major faux pas, and one which Anson’s underlings were swift to smother. Retractions were made, explanations were offered, assurances of FIFA’s probity were uttered. But he had said it, he clearly meant it, and the conclusion was obvious: if 13 were ‘buyable’, then presumably they would be bought. But bought by whom? For how much? And what measures had the bid team taken to obtain such damaging facts? I remember worrying about the issue for several weeks. On the one hand, the dinner was a private function, with everything off the record. On the other, the bidding team were spinning the story that England had great expectations of success. David Beckham, Lord Coe and Andy Anson look dejected as England miss out on hosting the 2018 World Cup . Media criticism was contemptuously rejected, international rascals were shamelessly embraced, squalid promises were lightly offered and about £21million was wastefully spent. And all this on a bid which 13 ‘buyable’ chancers had already rendered irrelevant; a bid which they knew was doomed to fail. Had Anson’s remark been reported, then FIFA would have erupted and England’s bid would have been instantly withdrawn. And we, the dreaded media, would have suffered both the blame and the consequences. And so, having promised silence, I said nothing, wincing as the charade unfolded and biting my tongue as breezy, baseless forecasts were doled out to a wholly unsuspecting public. And it came to pass that a magnificent bid which was superior to the rest by every criterion — and immeasurably superior to the Russian entry — received just two votes and went out on the first ballot. Once again, Anson tried to blame the media, a reaction which would have been hilarious were it not so depressing, and with the medieval emirate of Qatar profiting through an even more outrageous fix, the movers and shakers at FIFA celebrated a clean sweep for the bad guys. Football's world governing body has come under enormous scrutiny after its handling of the World Cup vote . The fact is, they feel themselves to be invulnerable. And after last week’s farcical developments, who shall blame them? The details have been well ventilated; the former US prosecutor, Michael Garcia, composed a deeply damaging report on the bidding processes for 2018 and 2022. He had faced certain drawbacks: his inquiry could not demand the presence of witnesses, he was banned from visiting Russia, and many of the Russians by and large declined to turn up, then told him their computers had been destroyed and their emails were lost, the high-tech equivalent of ‘the dog ate my homework’. The Qataris, similarly, lavished £1.15m on the African Confederation’s conference and doled out seductive grants to developing countries through their ‘Aspire Academy’. FIFA decided against publishing his 430-page report, but instead commissioned a precis by Hans-Joachim Eckert, the chair of the adjudicating chamber of FIFA’s ‘Ethics Committee’. His conclusion, that everything was sweetness and light with both bids, seemed to be repeatedly contradicted by much of the evidence he had published. Even when Garcia complained with great bitterness that his report had been wilfully misrepresented, their complacency was unshaken. People read the headlines, you see; the small print does not carry the same impact. So, it’s trebles all round and a whitewash well done. For the truth is, they believe they can get away with it. And history tells us they are probably right. Michael Garcia (left) and Hans-Joachim Eckert pictured together in 2012 at FIFA headquarters in Zurich . The FA chairman, Greg Dyke, called it ‘a bit of a joke’, which was an understatement, but he also said something of real importance: ‘The whole of the way football operates at that sort of level is suspect, and has been for many years. I don’t think FIFA are a straight organisation and haven’t been for many years.’ Think about that: the man who leads the oldest football association in the world believes that the world governing body are not straight; in other words, they are crooked, and they have been for years. Is that not a desperately serious allegation? FIFA are corrupt, indefensible, unfit for purpose; yet they expect to sail serenely on, led by their dubious, 78-year-old president Sepp Blatter, who has an outrageous ambition to serve his fifth five-year term. They appear to be banking on the notion that nobody really cares, that things will always be this way, that wholesale, deep-rooted corruption is a way of life. Soviet Russia, a rather more substantial monolith, harboured a similar delusion. Yet scarcely a decade later it was gone, buried beneath the debris of its own moral anarchy. There may be a lesson there, if Blatter and his cronies care to learn it. FA chairman Greg Dyke appeared on Newsnight on Thursday to discuss the FIFA report into corruption . P.S . The legalised loan sharks known as Wonga have graciously announced that they are to remove their logo from Newcastle United’s replica shirts and training kit for children, up to the age of 13. The move is the brainwave of Wonga’s new chairman, one Andy Haste, who apparently wants to ensure that the young ones are not persuaded to rush out and snap up loans at an extortionate rate of interest. There is a word to describe this latest gimmick, but our lawyer refuses to let me use it. So we must settle for ‘disingenuous’.

"So there will be no title decided in January. Innate caution won the day over decisive risk taking. In short, the spectacle did not fit the billing. Not even the return of Frank Lampard to Stamford Bridge for the final 15 minutes of the game — the reaction was generally, though not exclusively, warm — could inject the necessary drama or create the fantastic finale. Chelsea and Manchester City both live to fight another day. The winter slog continues and the warm spring of title celebrations still seems some way off. In the end, Manuel Pellegrini had more to lose, though it was his side which created the better chances and it was they who sought the winner in those final anxious minutes. Jose Mourinho was, of course, content. ‘What we have, we hold,’ might well be his mantra and a five-point lead going into February will suit just fine. The statistics will show they recorded just three shots, their lowest at home since 2003-04 and none in the second half. All will be forgiven if the title returns.

Mourinho is still not talking to the press, but we didn’t need his words to confirm what his intentions are in the coming months. There will be no rash dash for the line. When he can, he will entertain; when he is challenged, he will revert to type. For Pellegrini the only victory he could claim was moral. ‘I think both teams have a clear style of play,’ he said. ‘Everyone wants to play in the way they think is better. ‘You analyse the style of Chelsea and I analyse the style of my team. I’m very proud of the way we played away against the leaders, where normally Chelsea wins. ‘We tried to win the game from the first minute, I’m very proud about that. And I think we created the chances, especially in the second half, to deserve more than the three points. I’m not happy about a point but I’m happy about the performance.’ He would not be drawn into a philosophical discussion of Mourinho’s football. ‘I’m not saying we’re more attacking,’ he added. ‘I’m saying both teams have a clear style.’ But that is not strictly true. Chelsea have scored 52 goals this season. When they wish to attack, they can; Saturday was not such an occasion. Nevertheless it left Pellegrini convinced he can still win the League. ‘I said before the game that it was very important but not the final so we still have time to recover those five points. And if we continue the way we did today it will be easier.’ Remy is congratulated by his Chelsea team-mates after scoring his fifth goal of the season . The Frenchman wheels away in celebration after finding a way past England goalkeeper Hart . It wasn’t that the football was bad, though the individual errors which characterised the first half will have embarrassed some stellar reputations, Vincent Kompany and Thibaut Courtois among them. For much of the game the problem was both sides were good, just not in the way that excites you and grabs your senses. There was much for coaches to admire in midfield: solidity, tracking back, good team shape. There was a wild moment towards the end, when James Milner swept a shot across goal, when you could believe that a dramatic conclusion was imminent. Yet chances were few, the Milner moment notable for its rarity rather than its clear-cut nature. The opening exchanges set the tone: tetchy and tight. When the chances and goals came, it was individual errors, calamitous ones from seasoned pros, which were to blame. It started on 24 minutes, when Branislav Ivanovic lost possession to Milner, a mistake which required Courtois to parry a shot from Sergio Aguero. Then it was Kompany losing out to Loic Remy, who crossed for Oscar, whose shot forced a Joe Hart save. On 32 minutes, Chelsea, busy appealing for a penalty, were caught out by a long ball which saw John Terry slip and Aguero break clear. The Argentinian should have scored but pulled the ball wide. And on 42 minutes Chelsea would prise City open with a quite delightful lofted ball from Ivanovic which found Eden Hazard in space on the far left. The Belgian delivered an exquisite first-time volleyed cross but for some reason Kompany, perhaps fearful of turning it into his net, appeared half-hearted as he slid in to block. As such, he let the ball through to Remy, who had the simplest task in turning it in. Kompany punched the ground in frustration, acknowledging his error. Chelsea centre back Kurt Zouma celebrates with Remy following the former QPR striker's first-half goal . Aguero's strike at goal was eventually turned in by Manchester City team-mate Silva . From such positions Mourinho’s team rarely surrender. Yet three minutes later they had. This time it was Courtois who had the aberration, flapping at a Jesus Navas cross. Perhaps he was distracted by Milner, but the ball fell to Aguero, who shot and saw David Silva turn his strike into the net. Thereafter, the game reverted to type. The highlight of the day was referee Mark Clattenburg giving Mourinho the kind of look primary school teachers reserve for their naughtiest pupils as the Chelsea manager protested another decision. City sat in Chelsea’s half in the second half without threatening much. There was a Fernandinho header into the ground which bounced upwards, requiring Courtois to tip the ball over on 56 minutes and a shot on 68 minutes from the Brazilian but Courtois collected that easily enough. The principal excitement came when Lampard returned, trotting on to a mixed reception with 15 minutes to go. Even he could not produce a denouement on such an auspicious occasion and perhaps because of that he was greeted warmly from all around the ground when the final whistle went.

"CLICK HERE to read Rob Draper's full match report from Stamford Bridge . Having scored 19 goals before injuring his knee against Everton on December 6, Sergio Aguero hasn't looked quite the same player since his comeback, to the obvious detriment of Manchester City's Premier League title hopes. His work in around the penalty area was sharp enough against Chelsea but the most important bit - putting the ball in the back of the net - eldued him once again. The Argentine, an unstoppable force before he limped off in tears clutching his knee at The Etihad nearly two months ago, hasn't scored in any of the four games he's played since his return, and he had good chances  to give City a victory their overall performance deserved. Sergio Aguero (right) takes a long-range shot as the Manchester City striker searches for a first goal in 2015 . The Argentina superstar was guilty of several misses during the 1-1 draw with Chelsea at Stamford Bridge . The Manchester City talisman is still trying to find his form since been sidelined by injury . Two passable opportunities, and one extremely good one, fell his way in the first half. First, he fired at Thibault Courtois when set up by David Silva, then a moment's hesitation allowed Kurt Zouma to produce a saving tackle in the penalty area. Most damagingly of all, after John Terry slipped, Aguero was allowed to run free to the edge of the area where a slightly hurried finish arced away from Courtois and beyond the far post. It was a chance he would have buried in the autumn. Chelsea were without suspended striker Diego Costa (right) and injured playmaker Cesc Fabregas (left) Loic Remy wheels away in celebration after handing Chelsea the lead at Stamford Bridge .

Those misses seemed particularly costly when Loic Remy converted a flowing Chelsea move from close range to fire the home side ahead after 41 minutes. But at least Aguero made partial amends by setting up City's equaliser on the stroke of half-time for David Silva, the forward firing a left-foot shot across the six-yard box for Silva to convert after Chelsea goalkeeper Thibauld Courtois had fumbled a punch. Remy's strike had appeared to justify Jose Mourinho's decision to select him ahead of Didier Drogba to replace the suspended 'stamper' Diego Costa.

But it was City who dominated the rest of the game with Aguero's clever dribbles possessing a threat to John Terry and company in the Chelsea back four. In the end though, it was Aguero's end product, one of the reasons he was an early contender for Footballer of the Year, that let him down. If he'd been 100 per cent, Pellegrini would have left him on until final knockings instead of removing him for Edin Dzeko for the final six minutes.

Luckily for City, spring is known as the season of new beginnings.","Chelsea drew 1-1 with Manchester City in their Premier League clash .

"Manchester City came from a goal down to secure a 1-1 draw with Chelsea at Stamford Bridge. Loic Remy opened the scoring for the Blues, before David Silva levelled for City just after half-time. Here, Sportsmail's Matt Barlow rates each player from the top-of-the-table clash in the Premier League. Chelsea . Thibaut Courtois: Confident saves from Jesus Navas and Sergio Aguero but missed his clearance punch on cross which led to Silva’s equaliser. 5.5 . Thibaut Courtois makes a fingertip save in the Chelsea goal from a Fernandino effort . Branislav Ivanovic: Sometimes too eager to burst forward and attack. Made a couple of slips in possession early in game. 6 . Kurt Zouma: Preferred again to Gary Cahill and excelled. Quick, powerful in the air and aware with one very good tackle on Aguero. 7.5 . John Terry: Got away with a rare slip which let in Aguero on goal in the first-half. Otherswise solid.7 . Cesar Azpilicueta: Good block denied Fernando early on but struggled to contain pace of Navas at times. 5.5 . Cesar Azpilicueta (right) heads the ball away under pressure from Manchester City's Jesus Navas . Ramires: In for Cesc Fabregas. Unable to match his creativity but mobile and industrious, winning and circulating the ball. 6.5 . Nemanja Matic: Strength important in early phase. Covered ground, broke up play and made vital recovery tackles. 7.5 . Eden Hazard: Bright first-half delivered a wonderful cross for Loic Remy’s goal, eased across goal on the volley. Faded. 7 . Chelsea midfielder Eden Hazard (left) attempts to take the ball away from Manchester City's Jesus Navas . Willian: Quiet. Not his usual high-energy contribution, before limped off with 10 minutes from time. 5 . Oscar: Also quiet. Unable to exert his creative influence on the game in the right areas of the pitch. 5.5 . Loic Remy: Starting only second Premier League game for Chelsea and opened the scoring with a simple finish after good movement. 6.5 . Loic Remy celebrates opening the scoring for Chelsea against Manchester City at Stamford Bridge . Substitutes: Didier Drogba on for Willian 80, Gary Cahill for Remy 87, Ruben Loftus-Cheek for Oscar 90+2. MANAGER: Jose Mourinho: Decision to start with Remy was rewarded. Sent on Cahill to protect the point. Yet more ranting on the touchline. 6 . Jose Mourinho gestures to his players from the touchline during Chelsea's game with Manchester City . Manchester City . Joe Hart: Not especially busy. Thirty minutes before his first real save, from Oscar, little chance with the goal and virtually redundant second half. 6 . Bacary Sagna: Preferred to Pablo Zabaleta, he found it difficult against Hazard in the first-half, but linked well with Navas in attack.6.5 . Vincent Kompany: Started strong - slip lets in Remy who set up Oscar – loses Remy for the goal – tries to read the cross and cut it out but can’t reach. 6 . Manchester City defender and captain Vincent Kompany rises to get his head on a corner . Martin Demichelis: The more solid of City’s central defenders. Read it well. Escaped a handball appeal first-half. 7 . Gael Clichy: Good job of containing Willian and the overlapping threat of Ivanovic. Chose well moments to get forward. 7 . Fernando: Won his share of tackles and competed in a physical midfield area. Booked. Subbed. 6 . Fernandinho: Also strong in midfield and supplied the ball well to the three attacking midfielders. 7 . Jesus Navas: Subdued early on but exploded into life after providing cross Silva’s equaliser. Excellent second half. 8 . Jesus Navas was the star man for Manchester City in their draw with Chelsea on Saturday . David Silva: Fabulous vision and appreciation and increasingly influential in game. First goal in six games. Booked. 7.5 . James Milner: Selfless performance to neutralise the attacking threat of Ivanovic and assist Clichy, before tucking inside. 6.5 . Sergio Aguero: Missed a terrific chance when game goalless. Sweet strike left-foot makes goal for Silva. Subbed. 6.5 . David Silva (left) celebrates his equaliser with Manchester City team-mate Sergio Aguero . Substitutes: Frank Lampard on for Fernando 76; Edin Dzeko for Aguero 83, Stevan Jovetic for Silva 89.

"When Steve Hansen first saw Richie McCaw playing for Otago Boys High School, he knew the 17-year-old was something special. Immediately he instructed his former employers at the Canterbury Crusaders to sign the youngster who will, under the watch of Hansen, captain the All Blacks for the 100th time on Saturday. In doing so, McCaw will further cement his name into New Zealand folklore. It is fitting that his milestone will be reached in Cardiff, where the iconic No 7 played his first game as captain back in 2004. Richie McCaw trains ahead of becoming the first player to captain his country in 100 Tests . McCaw has been rated as 'probably our greatest rugby player ever' by All Blacks coach Steve Hanson .

The 33-year-old may be reaching the closing stages of his career, but his appetite to win is no less than in his first Test in 2001. That, according to Hansen, is what makes his former academy graduate ‘probably our greatest rugby player ever’. ‘Even now, after 136 Tests, he still wants to be better,’ said Hansen. ‘He’s still knocking on the door asking, “How can I be better?” Richie’s game has continually evolved over time.’ The evolution started over dinner with his uncle at a McDonald’s in Otago, New Zealand. McCaw was preparing for his first age-group trial and his uncle mapped out the journey to become an All Black on the back of a napkin. He told McCaw to sign the napkin with the words ‘Great All Black’, but McCaw felt uncomfortable and instead went under the pseudonym ‘G.A.B.’.

The first major step of his career was to move north and join up with Hansen at the Crusaders academy. His work-rate meant he left school with top grades, but his reaction to scoring 99.4 per cent in his maths exam was: ‘I missed one bloody mark.’ That competitive nature carried through and Hansen recalls the hunger he showed at one of his first senior training sessions. ‘Toddy (Blackadder), Reuben (Thorne), Razor (Scott Robertson) and Angus Gardiner came up to me at one point and said, “Listen, if he comes into another ruck and pinches another ball, then we’re going to snot (slap) him”.

I had to tell him, “Just let them win a couple, will you, you’re starting to p*** them off!”. ‘He wasn’t a natural athlete; he had four feet and couldn’t catch a cold.

Wales lit the touch-paper with comments that New Zealand are ‘there to be taken’, but Hansen does not think they believe their own words. ‘They probably feel like they have to say it,’ he said. ‘Sometimes we find our inner belief by talking. History gives you self-belief but success gives you more.’ That self-belief runs through the veins of New Zealand, especially those of their Great All Black.","New Zealand take on Wales in their autumn international Test on Saturday .

"West Bromwich Albion and Aston Villa have made enquiries about signing Tottenham midfielder Etienne Capoue on loan. The 26-year-old France international has also been the subject of interest from Sevilla and Real Sociedad this week and is thought to be considering his options in a quest to secure more regular first-team football. Capoue's omission from Spurs' last match-day squad against West Brom at The Hawthorns on Saturday will have no doubt compounded the player's frustrations.

"His father is a Nigerian scientist. His mother is a Romanian former economist who looks after the elderly. His older brother is a doctor who moonlights as a rapper. Clearly the upbringing of Ikechi Anya, Scotland’s exciting winger, was anything but typical as the four of them were crammed together in a small flat on Glasgow’s rough Castlemilk estate. But that was the perfect environment to prepare the Watford player for the unusual pathway his career has presented. From fearing for his future in the game while struggling with a long-term knee injury and without a club aged 19, to moving to Spain under the tutelage of Glenn Hoddle, eventually to earn a Scotland call-up and score against World Cup winners Germany this September. VIDEO Scroll down for Ikechi Anya dazzles with keepy-up tricks on Scottish training pitch . Ikechi Anya was born to a NIgerian father and Romanian mother, but grew up in Glasgow's Castlemilk estate . Anya celebrates scoring during Scotland's Euro 2016 qualifier against Germany in September . Anya had not even played for a Sunday League team until the family left Scotland in 1995, when he was aged seven, to move to Oxford. His southern English accent, with a London edge, belies that Scottish estate he grew up on. It was after the move to England that a kid on the playground spotted this tiny — Anya is only 5ft 5in now — but rapid player who effortlessly skipped past his opponents and invited him to join his team Garden City FC. Anya remains in touch with the boy’s father, Mark Webb, his first manager at Garden City, and his assistant Les Deabill. Webb bought Anya his first football boots. ‘I remember the first meeting vividly,’ Anya recalls. ‘I was small and he was this fully grown man asking me if I wanted to play for the team. He really helped me with my football. I’m hoping to get him one of my shirts from the England game.’ Watford winger Anya has become a Scotland regular under manager Gordon Strachan . Wycombe Wanderers (2004-07) Oxford City (2007-08) Halesowen Town (2008) Northampton Town (2009) Sevilla Atletico (2009-10) Celta B (2010-11) Celta (2011) Granada (2011-13) Cadiz - loan (2011-12) Watford - loan (2012-13) Watford (2013-present) An eight-year-old Anya nervously asked his parents for permission. Playing football was not befitting of his father’s household. It rankled with the education-centred ethos of Chinasa, who is a doctor of metallurgy and who had taken the family to Oxford to work for the university, but his mother backed him and has done so ever since. ‘Dad was very strict on me and my brother Chima,’ Anya explains. ‘With his African roots he was all about education. After school we had to study extra hours. We clashed a bit. ‘When I decided I wanted to pursue football at 14 my dad didn’t really approve. That was when instead of doing an hour after school studying I would only do that hour if my dad was in the house. My love for football developed as my attention and application to school work went the other way.’ Mariana drove her son to every training session and was there on the touchline for every match. She is still at almost all his games now. Chinasa still only watches the occasional match on television. Anya’s mother supported him when Wycombe Wanderers released him after his first two-year professional contract ended in 2007. He was without a club and struggling with a persistent knee problem. A young Anya gets ready to make an appearance for Wycombe Wanderers in 2005 . Anya played for sides such as Halesowen Town and Northampton before joining Watford . Spells at non-League Oxford City and Halesowen Town kept him playing, before the opportunity to join the Glenn Hoddle Academy arose. The academy is now closed but it proved a turning point in Anya’s career. He was recommended for a trial by his former Wycombe manager John Gorman, who had been assistant manager to Hoddle with England. He was accepted and left the family behind to fly to Jerez in Spain to join the academy. ‘The academy was really only for players released from Premier League clubs who had not made it initially. But because of John’s relationship he helped me. ‘The whole idea of the academy was that Hoddle felt players were judged too early. It was like a training camp and we had friendlies against teams in the area like Sevilla and Real Betis.’ Anya had a brief five-month spell at Northampton and they offered him a longer-term deal but after impressing Sevilla in two friendlies he signed a two-year contract with their B team, then spent three years living in Spain, moving to Celta Vigo, Granada and Cadiz. Anya plied his trade at Football League outfit Northampton Town before his spell out in Spain . There are 23 players based in England in the Scotland squad. The exceptions are Craig Gordon, Scott Brown, Charlie Mulgrew (all Celtic) and Lewis Macleod (Rangers). ‘It was hard to begin with,’ he remembers. ‘I didn’t know the language so I was training then going straight home. That’s when my dad’s influence helped. I knew I had to learn Spanish. After training I would teach myself. Life got better as I got better at it.’ The chance to return to England came when Watford took him on a season-long loan from Granada, which turned into a three-year permanent deal signed last year. His performances in the Championship, where he began showcasing his blistering pace and dribbling, meant a call-up to the Scottish national team soon followed. Anya is 26, in footballing terms a late developer to the international scene, but the pinnacle, so far, was scoring against World Cup winners Germany in Dortmund in September. Scotland lost 2-1, but his goal will live long in the memory. Anya had started sprinting from the halfway line down the left when released by Steven Fletcher. Three Germans were in tow but his sheer speed meant none of them got close. Anya took only two touches to take the ball into the area and then side-foot it around goalkeeper Manuel Neuer and in. He has not stopped watching replays since. The Scottish winger beats Germany goalkeeper Manuel Neuer with his brilliant striker in September . Anya remains close to his family. Although he spoke little to his brother, now 30, growing up, they have become friends and, along with Chima’s girlfriend Chantelle, Anya describes the trio as ‘The Three Musketeers’. He is a devout Christian and attends church regularly, when football permits. He went on Sunday with his godparents. His mother drove the 12-hour, 720-mile round trip from Oxford to Glasgow’s Celtic Park to see him play in Scotland’s Euro 2016 qualifying win against the Republic of Ireland on Friday night. And she will make the journey again when they host England on Tuesday. 'She was pushing me to play football, believed in me from day one and has been there through good and bad,’ Anya says. ‘She always looked at me as if I was the best player in the world. With that kind of confidence you can’t go wrong. ‘My brother’s great passion is music. But the difference between me and my brother is when dad had him pursing education, he wasn’t strong enough to say he wanted to do his own thing. I think he’ll admit that. He did what my dad wanted and became a doctor.’ Shaun Maloney (left) celebrates with Steven Naismith and Anya after a goal for Scotland against Poland . The Three Musketeers will perhaps become four — true to Alexandre Dumas’s 19th-century novel — when Anya stops playing. He is single at the moment and puts that down to his commitment to the game. ‘I’m all about football, football, football,’ he says. ‘I’m trying my hardest to get to the highest level. When I hang my boots up I want to have done everything I can: eat right, recovered right, live right, sacrificed everything to let me become as good as I can. ‘But I know football doesn’t last for ever. What do I want to do on this earth? Now, I want to play football, but when I get older, what would give me satisfaction? Time is still on my side. Hopefully it will come to me.’ Would he consider finally following his father into education and academia? He laughs and adds: ‘I’ve passed that stage. The brain is like any other muscle: you use it or lose it. I was intelligent once, I’m not so intelligent any more.’","Ikechi Anya hoping to help Scotland to victory against England .

"There's a little bit of a feeling that Fiji have become the forgotten team of our World Cup group, but we know the danger they pose if not taken seriously. They have some really talented players based all over Europe. Their sevens background naturally breeds players who like to play an expansive and attractive style. Sevens is a quick game and it helps develop a lot of good centres, wingers and full backs. You only have to look at Semesa Rokoduguni and Tevita Kuridrani, who play for England and Australia, for two examples of the kind of talent produced in Fiji. Wales' George North (right) gets away from Australia's Bernard Foley during their match last Saturday . The Welsh were beaten 33-28 by the Wallabies at the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff . Saturday is a chance to lay down a World Cup marker. The All Blacks are obviously the No 1 team in the world and we play them the following week, but that won’t be in the back of anyone’s mind. Fiji are our focus; they are really strong and, if we’re not switched on, they can do some damage. On a personal note, it will be nice for me to get back on the wing after my run at centre against Australia. I enjoyed the switch in position, even if it was cut short by the injury to Leigh Halfpenny. Our performance was very positive, but there has been a negative spin put on it because of the final score. While we didn’t get the victory, we did outscore Australia by four tries to three. Any other day that would be a win. Semesa Rokoduguni runs with the ball during England training ahead of their clash with South Africa . Australia's Tevita Kuidrani breaks through the Welsh defence to score a try against them last Saturday . It was our first game on the new semi-artificial pitch. The surface was very quick compared to what we had previously, but the more we play on it, the easier it will become. I think it can give us a real advantage going forward — starting tomorrow. We’ve got James Hook back in the squad and it’s great to have him involved. He was left out initially but he’s already up to speed; that alone goes to show what a talented player he is. Rhys Priestland was booed by a small part of the crowd on Saturday and that’s pretty appalling. No player deserves that. He’s an outstanding talent and I don’t think people understand how rough he’s had it in terms of injuries and criticism on social media. It almost caused him to hang up his boots. I don’t think anyone should be driven to that position. It’s just not on. The team all support him. Everyone has ups and downs, but I think Rhys has shown in his last four or five games for the Scarlets that his form is coming back. Rhys Priestland of Wales is tackled by Nick Phipps of Australia (right) during the match between the two sides . He just needs some time to find his feet. Warren Gatland told him to go out and show two fingers to his doubters and I agree with him. When he finds his form everyone will suddenly say, ‘Oh, he’s amazing, whey didn’t we pick him for the first Test?’ It’s just the Welsh public! We're doing a lot of intensive training and that definitely helps you build up an appetite throughout the day. Big John Williams, our nutritionist, puts on some lovely grub for us. It’s all very healthy stuff but I like to have the occasional sweet on the side. A lot of the big front-five guys can put their food away, but none more so than Rhodri Jones — he can eat like there’s no tomorrow! When he’s not hungry he will still eat and he’s face down most of the time without a knife and fork! Wales player Rhodri Jones (centre) is tackled by two Australian defenders as he tries to break the line . I’m trying to get in the spirit of Movember. I’ve joined my Northampton team-mates in the Front Mo Union, so hopefully we can raise some money. I like to think I have a bit of a Ron Burgundy look, but really it’s more of a top-lip slug! Warren Gatland told the media on Saturday that Gareth Anscombe, the Kiwi who has just joined Cardiff, needs to familiarise himself with the Welsh banter before he joins up with the squad. My tip would be to come in with an open mind and not to spend too much time with Scott Williams and Bradley Davies, because they have shocking banter. He should sit down for a coffee with Mike Phillips; he is good craic and would definitely help him get to know the Welsh way!

"An emotional Frank Lampard lingered after the final whistle to say a final farewell to Stamford Bridge  after his Manchester City picked up a 1-1 draw against former club Chelsea in a battle between the Premier League's top two. Lampard, given a mixed and muted reception by Chelsea fans when he was sent on by City manager Manuel Pellegrini as a 77th-minute substitute, stayed on the pitch after every other player had disappeared down the tunnel to applaud all four corners of the stadium, and his name was chanted by some of the remaining supporters. The 36-year-old was making his first appearance at Stamford Bridge since leaving Chelsea for City last summer after 13 years as the club's record goalscorer.

Whereas some Chelsea fans were less pleased with Lampard because of his move to Manchester City . With a move to New York City promised at the end of the season, he won't return again unless City are drawn against Chelsea in the latter stages of the Champions League. ‘It was a bit of a strange day for me,' admitted Lampard afterwards. 'I was excited but a bit nervous because of coming back here. As a player here you don’t even think about it but I knew this would be different. but I enjoyed it in the end. ‘I was delighted with the reception from both sets of fans. Chelsea quite rightly get behind their side but they showed their class and I am very thankful for that.’ Lampard got some applause when he came on for Fernando but there were also a few jeers. The vast majority of Chelsea fans it appears simply tried to ignore him, chanting the name of their team as he made his entrance.

The Chelsea boss didn't speak afterwards – he still claims there is a campaign against Chelsea and is angry at a three-match ban imposed on Costa for stamping – but midfielder Nemanja Matic claimed the midweek Capital One Cup semi-final against Liverpool which went to extra-time had an effect. Matic said: ‘It was a very hard game against Liverpool. We felt a bit tired, especially in the last 20 minutes. 'It was difficult to run with City players because they were more fresh than us. But I am happy because everyone gave 100 per cent if not more. ‘We expected three points today but I think a draw is a fair result. We had some chances and they had some chances.'","Frank Lampard receives mixed reception from Chelsea fans on return .

"I have had an amazingly happy time since the last race in Russia. It was there that Mercedes won the constructors’ championship for the first time – a historic moment for everyone concerned. What that experience reinforced for me is just how much of a team sport Formula One is. It is the championship that means most to all the people involved; it is the one we all win together. I visited our two factories, Brackley and Brixworth, and it was obvious how everyone felt the same sense of elation. The atmosphere was brilliant. The champagne was out and we sang, ‘We are the Champions,’ which turned out to be a bit embarrassing for me when it went out on Sky. You couldn’t hear the rest of the team singing; just my voice! As some people said I should stick to the driving! Nico Rosberg (left) and Lewis Hamilton (right) pose for a selfie with hoardes of the Mercedes team .

'There are great races with all eyes on the battle between Lewis and me and we want to make it a great finale' The next big party that is scheduled for the team is our ‘Stars and Cars’ event at the Mercedes museum in Stuttgart at the end of the season. I went there when I was a Mercedes go-kart driver in 2000, at the start of my career and now I will be back as part of a championship-winning team. That is awesome, but I also hope I will be there with a drivers’ title under my belt, too. That brings us to this weekend’s US Grand Prix in Austin – three races from the end of the season. I am 17 points behind Lewis in the drivers’ championship but there are 100 points available. I would prefer to be ahead, of course, but that is the way it is and there is everything to play for. I’m feeling very good about the situation. I didn’t know how I would feel when it came down to the final few races – whether I would be nervous or whatever, but I am feeling fine, maybe even relaxed. It is an amazing opportunity. There are great races with all eyes on the battle between Lewis and me and we want to make it a great finale. I am fully prepared. After going to the factory, I went to Ibiza for a few days. I did some training there – it was an opportunity to give the fitness levels a final boost. It is nearly impossible to ramp up the fitness during the season so that is what I was trying hard to do. Then we did a private Oktoberfest with my family in the south of France – I was wearing the Bavarian outfit. After a day in the simulator in Brackley I went to a driving event and did some passenger rides at the Nurburgring for our partner BlackBerry and then I came early to Austin. I have been here since Monday to make sure I get over the jet-lag 100 per cent. It is fantastic that F1 is racing in Austin. The city is so cool, so different – their slogan is ‘Keep Austin Weird’, after all. Vivian, my wife, is with me and we have enjoyed our time here. On Thursday I had the best burger in my entire life. I put it together myself because there are so many things I can’t have – onions, because they are among the hardest things to digest, and gluten. So I had gluten-free bread with Japanese meat – they had Japanese meat for some reason – with a fried egg on top with tomato and lettuce. It was spectacular. That was not the end of the culinary experience, though. On Wednesday, I went with the whole team to a steakhouse to celebrate the constructors’ title – well deserved by the boys. Every time we are here there is a debate about how much the impact the sport has on America. My experience has been of many Americans coming up to me and saying they are following the Formula One. They say they are following me and urging me to keep it up. I get the feeling there is a lot of interest in F1 here. My best position at the Circuit of Americas is ninth but I don’t look at statistics like that. They are not relevant. With the car I have everything is possible anywhere. My approach is to look forward to the next three races and to get the most out of them. Rosberg is 17 points behind Hamilton and will be hoping to make up ground in the race on Sunday .

Anything can happen in the next few races, we can make it a great finale .
There are 100 points to play for and it would be great to start well in Austin .

"As a qualified plumber, Rhys Webb is ready to throw the kitchen sink at the All Blacks this weekend. The scrum-half is also keen to patch up any leaks in the Welsh defence as he prepares to take on a New Zealand side he claims are ‘there to be taken’. It is a bold statement from the 25-year-old half-back, particularly given the fact his country have failed to beat the Southern Hemisphere giants since 1953. But Wales are hoping to catch the Kiwis cold in their final game of the season, just as England did in 2012. Webb is high on confidence after displacing long-term favourite Mike Phillips from the Welsh line-up and, having seen the All Blacks run close by Scotland and Australia, believes Wales have the key to unlock their interminable dominance. Wales scrum half Rhys Webb is looking forward to the clash with the All Blacks in Cardiff on Saturday . ‘They’re a world-class team who are top of the rankings at the moment,’ said Webb. ‘But I think they are there to be taken. ‘Australia nearly pipped them and Scotland put in a real tough performance against them. You’ve got to be physical. They’ve been getting a bit flustered when people have been going at them. I think if we can play our game plan, not take a backward step and really get into them then we can put on a good show.’ Having spent the early stages of his Ospreys career playing second fiddle to 81-cap All Black scrum-half Justin Marshall, Webb is familiar with the Kiwi ways. On Saturday he is expected to face 37-capper Aaron Smith and hopes that Marshall’s teachings will work in his favour at the Millennium Stadium. Webb is high on confidence after displacing long-term favourite Mike Phillips from the Welsh line-up . ‘At the Ospreys, learning off Justin was very special,’ said Webb. ‘Just the way he controls the game and his running side of the game as well. It’s not all about passing, passing, passing but the way he likes to take on defenders as well. 'Obviously he was really good at closing out games. He could slow it down at vital times and keep an eye on the scoreboard and clock; managing the boys around him.’ As well as working in the shadows of Marshall, Webb has also been following in the footsteps of an impressive Brynteg Comprehensive alumnus. JPR Williams, Gavin Henson and Rob Howley are all former students from the Bridgend school, with the latter now in charge of the Welsh back-line. Webb will face New Zealand's star number nine Aaron Smith at the Millennium Stadium showdown . Howley made 59 appearances in the red jersey and now works closely with Webb in his role as assistant to Warren Gatland. Both Howley and Gatland see the half-back combination of Webb and Dan Biggar as the best option to take Wales through to the World Cup, particularly given their impressive form for the Ospreys. The Guinness PRO12 pair have developed an understanding at club level and are the latest half-back ‘unit’ to play together for their country. The pair have followed the likes of Nick Phipps and Bernard Foley (Waratahs and Australia), Will Genia and Quade Cooper (Reds and Australia) and Francois Hougaard and Handre Pollard (Bulls and South Africa). ‘We know each other inside out - the different options we have and knowing where he is,’ said Webb. ‘ . 'As a nine you need to know where the 10 is at all times and he’s obviously really vocal as well, which helps nine. He doesn’t shut up but that’s good for a nine, for directing forwards around us. He’s a really confident player as well - he’s full of confidence at the moment, which is good for Wales. Hopefully he can run a good show for Wales.’ Webb cites 81-cap All Black scrum-half Justin Marshall as a huge influence during his time at the Ospreys . Webb endured a mixed afternoon in the opening defeat to Australia. He scored the opening try with a characteristic snipe from the breakdown, but was then caught out by Israel Folau, who intercepted his pass for an 80-metre run in. Such moments of naivety will be punished against the All Blacks but Webb is no longer the one in the shadows. The shirt is his to lose and a solid performance on Saturday will surely see his stronghold through to the final Test against South Africa next week. ‘I know when you play in that jersey, it’s not permanent,’ said Webb. ‘I’ve been enjoying my rugby this year so I think that’s helped in selection. You need to put on a real performance to keep hold of the jersey but it means a lot to wear it this weekend against one of the best sides in the world. I remember watching Jonah Lomu scoring tries and running over people. It’s a dream come true.’","Rhys Webb will start at scrum half against New Zealand on Saturday .

"The Singapore Grand Prix was, in terms of racing, the toughest day of the year for me. For our car to break down and then to watch the remainder of the action on the pit wall was a really strange feeling. As soon as I stepped into the car before heading to the grid for the race everything stopped working. Up until that point it had all been fine, but the moment I sat in the cockpit we encountered problems which really was quite amazing. My team managed to get the car up and running so I could head to the grid before the pit-lane closed. I remained positive and hoped that the problem would resolve itself because it was quite intermittent, but it didn't work out. Nico Rosberg watches the Singapore Grand Prix from the pit wall after being force to retire after 14 laps . Rosberg's car is pushed off the Marina Bay Circuit on a day the driver says was his toughest of the year . 'It was like having only half a car,' says Rosberg (centre), such were the problems leading to his withdrawal . The cable connection in the steering column was short-circuited, so the steering wheel simply did not work. The gearshift paddles worked, but not to their full capacity as it was upshifting double gears. What I mean by that is when I wanted to go from third to fourth it went from third to fifth and so on. It really was all over the place. I couldn't use KERS and I did not have any electrical power. I didn't have DRS either so it was like having only half a car. I was at the back of the field and couldn't pass the Caterham of Marcus Ericsson, so on lap 14 we decided to call it a day as it was pointless continuing like that. It wasn't my decision to retire, but the team felt it was in our best interest. It was a big pity as we lost a lot of points, particularly to my team-mate Lewis who won the race. But after I retired I decided to hang around to see if I could learn anything. On the pit wall there is always an opportunity to listen in to what is going on so that's what I did and I certainly picked up a few pointers. I could see what the team were doing strategically during the race. I have never had the opportunity to sit there and do that, so it was a good experience for me to see it from that point of view as I am normally in my race car. When Rosberg's Mercedes' couldn't pass Caterham's Marcus Ericsson (left) it was time to call it a day . While disappointed, Rosberg says he took the opportunity to see how the team operate on the pit wall . The team apologised to me after the race which was a nice gesture from them. We now know what the problem was and I have absolutely moved on from it. I am very, very positive and looking forward to the final five races of the season. I should also mention that it was fantastic that we still had the best car in Singapore as it has been throughout the season. During qualifying, it was incredible that Lewis and I were separated by just seven-thousandths of a second on a circuit which is over three miles in length. That difference between us both crossing the start-finish line on our respective laps was not even the width of my foot, but it decided first and second place on the grid which was pretty tough to take. That said I was still pleased to be starting second and looking forward to what could have been a brilliant battle, but then we had our reliability issue. Certainly reliability is the weakness of our team at the moment and we are working flat out to try and improve on that area. But I don't worry about the car breaking down. I trust my car. I trust my team, and if it happens, it happens, but it is not something I am concerned about at all. The Mercedes AMG team work on Rosberg's car after he was taken off the track at the Marina Bay Circuit . I am now three points behind Lewis in the championship but I will not approach this weekend's Japanese Grand Prix any differently. The plan is to win and that has always been the case so I will try to do the same thing here. It is an amazing situation to be in with the team and despite what happened in Singapore there is still everything to play for so I am in full-on attack heading into this weekend. Indeed it is the first time that I have arrived in Suzuka knowing that I have the best car on this incredible circuit so we have the opportunity to be on pole and win which is an awesome feeling and I want to make the most of it. Rosberg (right) is now three points behind team-mate Lewis Hamilton after the Brit won in Singapore . Suzuka is without question one of the best circuits on the calendar and the fans are so enthusiastic and very, very unique. They go nuts for F1 which is, as a driver and someone who loves the sport, too, always brilliant to see. It has been very wet this week but if it rains at any point over the weekend I am not concerned because our car is amazing in the damp conditions. After the race in Singapore I went on holiday to Thailand to try and adapt to the timezone for this weekend's race so I have no jet lag. I spent most of my time relaxing and training; having a rest in between races is always a good opportunity to ramp up the fitness, too. After some rest and training in Thailand, Rosberg's back to business at a Mercedes Benz function in Tokyo . Rosberg fulfils his duties to his sponsors ahead of a race on a track he says is one of F1's best in Suzuka . The FRIC has been taken off the car so the diet which we were all concerned about before the start of the season is not as much of an issue now. I can easily put on a few kilos which is refreshing. But to be honest I have stuck closely to the same diet because I have plenty of energy and felt really good, having adapted my nutrition. On Wednesday I was in Tokyo for a sponsors event and it really is an awesome city. There is so much that you can do there. I also went for dinner in a really amazing japanese restaurant. I always enjoy Japan very much!

"A midfield showdown with Sonny Bill Williams and Conrad Smith is international rugby’s equivalent of tackling the Da Vinci Code, but Wales centre Jonathan Davies believes he is ready to take on the All Blacks duo after a month on the side-lines. Having not played since October because of a lat-muscle injury, Davies was drafted straight back into the starting XV at Tuesday’s team announcement in the Vale of Glamorgan. The 26-year-old missed out on the previous Tests against Australia and Fiji but will start at the Millennium Stadium on Saturday, when Wales will attempt to end their 25-match losing streak against the southern hemisphere giants. Jonathan Davies returns to Wales' starting line-up against New Zealand after a month on the sidelines . New Zealand coach Steve Hansen has promised to field a fully loaded side in Cardiff but, despite admitting that more recovery time would have been a plus, Davies feels his work with the conditioners has done enough to get him up to speed to face the world’s No 1 team. ‘You don’t want to get injured when you are in the Wales camp because you probably get flogged more than the fit boys,’ said Davies. ‘I have done a lot of fitness work, the conditioners have worked hard with me and the injury feels fine. 'You want to put yourself up against the best and that’s what is going to happen on Saturday. Ideally I would have had a bit more game time but that’s how the world goes.’ Davies starts in the centres against the world champions on Saturday in Cardiff . Hansen will name his starting XV on Wednesday morning but the Kiwi is expected to put his faith in the centre partnership of Smith and Williams, with the latter recently completing a code switch back from rugby league. Davies, meanwhile, will be joined in the Welsh midfield by Jamie Roberts and their partnership must be watertight if they are going to deny the tourists yet another victory over European opposition. ‘I played against [Sonny Bill Williams] away with the Scarlets at Toulon [in 2010], but I try and forget that one,’ said Davies. ‘He’s shown he can jump back and forth from rugby league to union and, as well as his off-loading ability, I think he’s a very intelligent player. He can put passes under the line. It’s important, as a midfield, we understand what each of us are doing in defence and we don’t allow them any gaps or voids. ‘Smith is the glue that holds them together. He’s outstanding in his consistency and he’s very intelligent in attack and defence. He probably doesn’ t get the plaudits he deserves because he is one of the best centres in the world. It’s going to be tough but I’m looking forward to putting myself up against him on Saturday, if he plays.’ Davies is the only player named in the Wales line-up who did not start the opening Test against Australia. Head coach Warren Gatland has kept faith in the same group of players as the Hamilton-born Kiwi bids to land a rare victory over his countrymen. The formidable duo of Conrad Smith (left) and Sonny Bill Williams await Davies on his injury return . Gatland has an impressive list of achievements on his coaching resume. But the 51-year-old is yet to beat the All Blacks and it is a challenge that sits near the top of his managerial bucket list. ‘I’m a very proud New Zealander and I follow closely what happens over there, particularly with the other sports,’ said Gatland. ‘If the All Blacks are playing someone else then I’m cheering for them, but there’s no one more desperate to win on Saturday than me. My mother-in-law was asked who she’s going to support at the weekend and she said “Wales of course, because family come first”. I’m totally focussed on my role here and my dedication is 100 per cent to Wales.’ Equally dedicated to Wales is skipper Sam Warburton, who is back in the starting line-up after being rested against Fiji. The Cardiff Blues forward has been named alongside Taulupe Faletau and Dan Lydiate, making the British and Irish Lions trio the most-played Wales back-row combination of all time. Proud New Zealander Warren Gatland (right) is aiming to tick beating his home nation off his bucket list . Sam Warburton (front) rejoins the side after the captain was rested for their win over Fiji . Warburton’s expected opponent, Richie McCaw, will set a personal milestone of his own on Saturday. The No 7 will captain the All Blacks for the 100th time in Cardiff and Warburton believes that, despite being in the latter stages of his career, the Kiwi flanker is still right up there with the world’s best. ‘I think McCaw, Hooper, Pocock, Louw and Tipuric are the best open-sides in the world at the moment,’ said Warburton. ‘You relish any opportunity to come up against those guys. Beating the All Blacks, being part of a winning Lions tour and winning the World Cup are up there with the top two or three things you can do at international level; it’s one down and two to go! This Saturday is a great opportunity to try and tick off another box.’ The skipper will need to be at his inspirational best if Wales are finally going to crack the code.

"It’s been almost four weeks since the last race in Hungary and during the summer break I have been able to reflect on the season so far and look ahead to the remainder of this year and even the 2015 campaign. I had a review with the team immediately after the last race. We went through the grand prix, where I finished fourth after starting from pole position, and looked to see how we can improve in the future. Given what had happened in Hungary, there was talk about team instructions, and it was something that we needed to discuss and go through. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Who is 16 year old F1 driver Max Verstappen? On track: Nico Rosberg finished fourth at last month's Hungarian Grand Prix after starting from pole position . We need to review what happens as the season goes on and revise our plans, too. So, we have gone through it, and we now know what we are going to do for the remainder of the year. It was important to do that. I then went to the factory to discuss next year’s car as more and more of the team’s focus is shifting towards what we’ll be doing in 2015. This is normal because you need to get a head-start on that. All the engineers were together, so they wanted to ask me questions, and get my opinion and insight for next season’s design. Away from Formula One, I had a really good time off. I was on a boat in Capri near Napoli in Italy for a week with my best friends. We did something called ‘pizza hopping’ which you can see on my Facebook account. Instead of bar hopping we tried out a number of different pizzas instead, because in Napoli they have some of the best in the world. Italian job: I spent part of my summer break 'pizza hopping' in a bid to track down the world's tastiest pizzas . Friends reunited: It was great to spend time with my pals; I'm ready and refreshed for the remainder of the year . Our mission was to find the world’s best pizza, so we tried out a host of different restaurants. It was a lot of fun, and we managed to find the best one at a restaurant called Pizzeria Da Michele. If you are ever in the area you must check it out. It was a crazy, crazy place; there were so many people at this tiny, random restaurant which is 140 years old. It is a phenomenon, and most importantly, the taste was amazing. I then spent a week in the south of France with my wife Vivian, cruising around, driving a Harley Davidson together which was really good. I managed to get in some training, too. I also had my cousin’s baptism to attend which was awesome. I am now a Godfather and it’s a very nice feeling as it is the first time, so that was great. Other than that I spent some time at home in Monaco getting ready for the next couple of races in Hungary and then after that the Italian Grand Prix. It’s difficult to take your mind off racing during the summer break, but I managed to completely relax. I definitely used my time off to refresh, but now I am ready to be in full-on attack mode for the remainder of the season. Let me take a selfie: The Pizzeria Da Michele was a crazy place with over 140 years of history to boast . Taking it to the Max . Earlier this week, Max Verstappen was announced as a Toro Rosso driver for next season. I don’t really know much about him or what he done up to now in his career. Of course he is very young but we’ll have to wait and see how it goes. He will be only 17 for the first race in Australia, but I am not concerned, and I don’t think any of the other drivers will be, although I am sure it is a topic that we will discuss. Rookie: Max Verstappen will make his Formula One debut next year at the tender age of just 17-years-old . Dan's the man . Daniel Ricciardo won his second race of the season in Hungary last time out and he is definitely among a few drivers who have  stood out this season. He is doing a good job and it is great to see how he is taking on his four-time world champion team-mate Sebastian Vettel. Of course it is surprising just how well he is doing because it was difficult to foresee a driver with limited experience taking on and sometimes beating his more established team-mate and performing in such an impressive way. I still expect he and Vettel at Red Bull and Williams to be our strongest rivals for the rest of the year. All smiles: Daniel Ricciardo has been very impressive since he moved to Red Bull from Toro Rosso . Reliability is a weakness . I am 11 points clear of Lewis Hamilton in the drivers’ championship, but with nine races left I will still be attacking and I am out to win races as it is too early to think about just finishing. We arrive at the Belgian Grand Prix and Spa-Francorchamps for round 12 of the championship. Every track has suited our car this season and I don’t expect this weekend to be any different. We have got a great Mercedes-Benz engine and our car also is also awesome in medium-to-high-speed corners so it should definitely suit us. Spa is a great track and one of the best on the calendar and with the car I have I am sure it is going to be a great weekend. Reliability however, is a weakness for us at the moment and it is one of the things that we are focussed on because it needs to be at 100 per cent. We are working on it, and we will get there, but there is still a little bit of a way to go before we’ll be totally happy. The team however, can’t work any harder because they are already giving it their all; to do any more than that would be totally impossible.

"After what happened at the Belgian Grand Prix, I took a lot of time to reflect on the events of the weekend – and we met as a team to discuss it last Friday, too. I analysed the whole situation in a lot of detail and reached the conclusion that I had to take responsibility for what happened because it was my error of judgement. It didn’t matter what part of right and wrong was involved, the fact is that it happened and I did not do a good enough job to avoid a collision between our two cars. Error of judgement: Nico Rosberg (right) collides with Lewis Hamilton during the Belgian Grand Prix . Debris flying: Bits of Rosberg's front wing came off after the collision at Spa . I have since apologised to everybody that I can; starting with the fans because they wanted to see a battle with Lewis and that did not happen. I have apologised to my team, and to everybody involved with the team. I have also apologised to Lewis. You cannot however, change what has happened. The subject attracted a lot of media attention and sensation but I really hope my apology will be accepted by the Formula One fans who have been critical of me. I was booed on the podium - which wasn't a nice feeling - but I understand that people had travelled a long way to see a great race between Lewis and myself, and they did not get that. I totally respect their opinion and I hope that in time they will accept my apology. I love my sport so much, I want F1 to be the best in the world and I want the fans to enjoy great racing. I started on pole in Spa but I got a really poor start off the line. I lost two positions to Lewis and then to Sebastian Vettel which dropped me down to third. I passed Sebastian after he made a mistake through Les Combes and then on the second lap I was quicker than Lewis coming out of Eau Rouge. Heading into Les Combes I tried to go around the outside of him to re-take the lead, but I misjudged the situation. In hindsight, the collision was my responsibility because I was the car trying to overtake, so I have to accept that I made a mistake and to apologise. I sustained damage to my front wing in the incident and it had to be replaced which saw me finish second behind race winner Daniel Ricciardo. The result enabled me to extend my lead in the championship, but when I left the circuit I hadn't really thought about that. I was concerned and distraught about the situation; one thing is for sure: I wasn't happy. I was instead thinking about the criticism - the way Niki Lauda, for example, had been critical about my driving. Apology: Rosberg has said sorry to Hamilton following the crash in Belgium . Repentant: Rosberg also apologised to his Mercedes team and Formula One fans . I was also thinking about the team discussions we'd had at the track; the result of our collision meant that one of us didn't finish the race and the other one didn't win, so it had also cost the team a lot of points. Niki has since apologised for what he said and, in the heat of the moment you often say things that you regret - that has happened to all of us. Last Friday, Lewis, Paddy Lowe, Toto Wolff and I met for talks at our headquarters in Brackley and it was very intense, but the outcome was a positive one: we have drawn a line under what happened in Belgium - we move forward and we can go racing again. Poor start: Hamilton (left) overtook Rosberg (immediately behind him) on the first corner . It has always been clear from the team that Lewis and I must not collide with one another during a race. If it did happen, and one driver is more responsible than the other, then there will be consequences. I've accepted that. The team have made it clear that we can go racing for the remainder of the season, and all I can say is that I am feeling good and I'm in full-on attack mode heading into this weekend's Italian Grand Prix at Monza. The team is doing such an awesome job in developing our car and making it faster and faster. So every race I have the chance to be on pole and win, which is a very special feeling. Since Spa, I have been in the simulator preparing for Monza, and I have taken part in some PR work, for example a Driving Experience day with Mika Hakkinen and some UBS clients. Not a nice feeling: Rosberg was booed when he stepped on to the podium in Belgium . On Sunday we had what we call a team family day at Kelmarsh Hall in Northamptonshire. It's great because every employee of the Mercedes F1 team brings their family so you can imagine how busy it was! There were thousands of us there, and it is nice to give something back for all the hard work they put in. This year they have changed the run-off area at the world-famous Parabolica corner in Monza, replacing the gravel trap with Tarmac. I haven't seen it yet, but I notice that it has attracted some criticism from the sport's fans. I completely understand that and it is a pity because it makes it easier for the drivers when there is room for error. But safety has to be the priority, and that is why they've brought in the change. Ricciardo's win in Belgium saw him close the gap to Lewis and I in the drivers' standings. He is doing a great job this season and he is a serious rival for title so we must keep a close eye on him and Red Bull in the remaining six races. Mind the gap: Daniel Ricciardo celebrates his Belgian Grand Prix win  and he is doing a great job for Red Bull .

"Taulupe Faletau admits 'there are no obvious weaknesses' presented by his opposite number ahead of Saturday's Millennium Stadium clash between Wales and New Zealand. Wales star Faletau, who is rated among the northern hemisphere's finest number eights, is set to line up against current world leader in that position Kieran Read. Read, the 2013 International Rugby Board world player of the year, is firmly established as a pivotal member of coach Steve Hansen's all-conquering All Blacks side. Taulupe Faletau has said opposite number Kieran Read is among the best in the world ahead of their meeting . Read has featured in five winning New Zealand teams against Wales, and Faletau is fully aware of the threat he poses. 'He has been up there among the best number eights in the world for a long time,' Faletau said. 'He is someone you look up to and someone you can learn from. 'He has so much to his game - there are no obvious weaknesses. He does everything really well, and he can create something out of nothing.' Wales No 8 Faletau said Read had no obvious weaknesses and was good at everything . If Wales are to have any chance of ending their 25-Test losing run against the All Blacks, then they will need to produce a vintage performance. Having been beaten at home by Australia earlier this month, despite outscoring the Wallabies on tries, and then endured a chronic struggle before edging out 14-man Fiji, the form guide suggests win number 26 for New Zealand. 'They are the number one side in the world, and they will be a good challenge to anyone,' Faletau added. 'But that is what you play for - to measure yourself up against the best. Read has been in five winning New Zealand teams against Wales and Faletau is aware of the threat he poses . 'It was pretty much a disappointing performance (against Fiji). We got the result, but the performance wasn't good enough and everybody knows that. 'We have to keep hold of the ball, go through the phases and hopefully that will open up spaces out wide. If we make that many mistakes again, New Zealand will take advantage of those opportunities more than Fiji did.' Wales head coach Warren Gatland, meanwhile, believes his players must adopt a positive approach to facing international rugby's biggest challenge. 'You have to play, be direct, run hard and be physical at the breakdown,' Gatland said. Faletau scores a try as for Wales against Fiji, only for it to be disallowed by the referee for a knock-on . 'It is a relatively simple message. You have to keep possession and look to put them under pressure, and you have to be able to defend their threats because their accuracy, vision and creating space and seeing opportunities are what make them different from other teams. 'You saw that against England (earlier this month), who looked comfortable for two or three phases and then for a split-second they over-chased to the open side and left the short side vulnerable. 'The All Blacks spotted that and (Richie) McCaw scored from a situation where England were not under any real pressure. Those are the things you have to be aware of to be able to stop them and put yourself in the game.'","Wales face New Zealand on Saturday at the Millennium Stadium .

"I got married to my beautiful girlfriend Vivian in Monaco last week and it was a wonderful experience. I wasn't sure if I would feel anxious about the occasion, but it was such a pleasure. There was only a small group of friends and family, it was quite intimate – and we all went to a beach restaurant after the ceremony and we continued the celebrations there. It was an awesome day, very emotional and it just felt right. Only 48 hours later, Germany then faced Argentina in the World Cup final. I watched the game with my family at my parents' house in Monaco. VIDEO Scroll down to see Rosberg signs Mercedes extension . Sealed with a kiss: Nico Rosberg married his partner Vivian Sibold at a ceremony in Monaco last week . It was such an intense match, and it . really could have gone either way. In the end, the Germans did it when . Mario Gotze scored with just seven minutes of extra-time remaining. It . was so, so awesome. I went crazy in the apartment when we scored and it . was a great experience, one that I will always remember. It was well deserved because Germany were the best team at the . tournament. I came home to Germany on Tuesday so I followed their . celebrations with the bus going through Berlin; there were some great . pictures and great energy. The whole team were fantastic throughout the tournament. Some players . were better in some matches and some in other games, so everyone . contributed. We've done it: Nico celebrates Germany's World Cup triumph over Argentina. Germany won 1-0 in extra-time . On Wednesday, it was announced that I've agreed a new contract with Mercedes, and I am very proud to have . signed a new deal with, for me, the most special team in Formula One. I . am a German driver at a German team, and I am so proud to continue the . history of the Silver Arrows. It is great  that we are dominating the . sport, we are the best team, and I am grateful for the trust that Toto . Wolff, Paddy Lowe and everyone else have shown in me. The discussions . about my new deal started a long time ago because most of us had great . interest in continuing what has been a successful relationship. The . process was an on-going one, but it was always relaxed and the time had . come to solidify and announce the deal. This is the place where I want . to be. I feel very much at home here, and they have shown a lot of faith . and respect in me and it is a great collaboration, so I am looking . forward to many more successful years with the team. I am also enjoying . the moment, because is special knowing that if I do a good job at each . race I can be on pole and if I do a good job on Sunday I will win the . grand prix. It doesn't get better than that. On track: It was announced on Wednesday that he 29-year-old had agreed a 'multi-year' deal with Mercedes . VIDEO Rosberg signs Mercedes extension . This week is my second . home race – the German Grand Prix – and it would round off an incredible . week if I could win on Sunday. So, that is the mission and I am looking . forward to completing it.  I am also looking forward to receiving the . support from the home fans which will be great. This race is special . because I know so many people are supporting us, and I am in the . fortunate position where I have two home races – in Monaco and . Hockenheim. In response to Lewis' comments about my nationality, I . don't really read the press, but I got a jist of what he said. I am very . much laid back about it, and I understand it was a joke from Lewis . rather than something serious. I am easy going and I don't have any . problems with such opinions and that is all I really have to say on the . matter. The atmosphere last time out at the British Grand Prix was . amazing. The fans were obviously there to support Lewis, but everybody . gave me the respect as well and even I could enjoy what was a brilliant . occasion, despite my own personal result. Unfortunately my gearbox . broke during the race and Lewis went on to win. Naturally, there was . then a lot of interest in whether I would have won the race had I not . suffered my first DNF of the season. It is impossible to say but let us . give the benefit to the guy who was leading. I was doing well at the . time, so I was pretty confident I could have made it happen and stayed . out in front. The early part of the race was red flagged for one hour . following Kimi Raikkonen's huge shunt. I just tried to chill out; I also . went to see Vivian and my friends and discuss the re-start with my . team. On Kimi's crash, it was certainly a big one, but it is difficult . to comment on it. There was a bump off the track which he hit and it is . difficult to foresee those sort of things so I can't really judge . whether he could have avoided it or not. I saw that his wheel narrowly . missed Max Chilton's helmet and I am sure we will have to discuss the . idea of closed-cockpit racing with the GPDA at some point in the near future.

"It was great to win last time out in Austria at the home of Red Bull. Somebody hung a Mercedes logo on the bull in the centre of the track - the Red Bull Ring - which was cool and a bit of fun after the weekend. They have been, and still are, our No 1 rivals. Williams were our nearest challengers in Austria, but I expect it to change to-and-from throughout the season, and I think Red Bull will be faster here at the British Grand Prix. But we will still be the quickest, although the gap is getting closer. Hands up for the winner: Nico Rosberg celebrates his victory in the Austria Grand Prix and (above) a Mercedes badge is hung around a statue of a bull in the middle of the race track . Prize guy: Rosberg raises the trophy at the Red Bull Ring in Austria . During qualifying for the race in Austria, we were definitely surprised, and caught off-guard as to how quick Williams, who secured a front-row lockout through Felipe Massa and Valtteri Bottas, were. They were really fast and that made the race a little bit more difficult; starting third on the grid as opposed to the front row which felt a bit weird. In Austria we were not as quick as we have been. Bottas and Massa were both very competitive and their pace was similar to ours which was surprising. But the race went well. We had a really good strategy, and that is what won us the grand prix because we pitted earlier than both of the Williams drivers and got the undercut. We had to manage our brakes throughout the race, which although it was planned and we knew it was coming, wasn't easy. Champagne spray party: Rosberg pops open the bubbly after his success . I had Lewis behind me, and it is always such a close battle between the both of us at every race. But I managed to stay in front and I could control the gap. There was never any risk or any chance that he would overtake me. There have certainly been other races where it has been more difficult to keep him behind. Our target in Austria was to extend the gap in the title race ahead of this weekend's race, I am 29 points clear, so I am happy with that. The momentum is definitely on my side at the moment and I need to make the most of it because it comes and goes so I have to try and keep it for as long as I can. Brilliant Britain . The British Grand Prix is always one of the best weekends on the calendar. I won it last year so I have good memories of that victory. As a race, it is very important because both our car and engine factories are nearby, so this is effectively a home race for us. I just want to do a great job for everyone who works at, and is connected to Mercedes, because that is such a nice gift to give back. All their friends, families and kids are talking about it, which is a great thing so I am going to go out there to try and make that happen. The atmosphere and the support from the fans is also fantastic to see. On Thursday, there were already plenty of people out en force even though the action on track doesn't start until 24 hours later. The circuit itself is so quick and one that I love competing on. Here comes the Wolff . Susie Wolff will be the first female racer to compete at a race weekend in 22 years when she takes part in practice on Friday, which I think is great. She has done a good job, and I will be really, really interested to see how she gets on. I will definitely be looking at her lap times. Flying the flag: Susie Wolff will become the first female to compete in 22 years . There is no reason why a woman can't make it back on to the racing grid one day. It is more difficult because there are less trying to make it - there are a lot more guys - but there is no reason a woman couldn't make it, so maybe we will see it one day. She has to do an all-round good job and be quick of course! She also has to show a good understanding of the car which she has and will do. It is very exciting and the best advice I have for her is to enjoy it. Girl power: Wolff will take part in practice on Friday . We're going to Ibiza . It was my 29th birthday earlier this week so I celebrated it with my best friends in Ibiza. It is very seldom that we all get together so it was a really good experience. We all went out partying, but it was quite relaxed and I didn't have a big party. My friends took it to the next level, but I stayed pretty chilled out. We still have 11 races to go - a long season ahead of us - so I need to keep all of my energy. Ibiza rocks: Rosberg celebrated his 29th birthday on the Spanish island . Germany must improve . Over in Brazil, Germany had a tough match against Algeria in their round of 16 clash. They progressed after extra-time, but they are not playing at their best level so they need to find something extra if they want to win this tournament. They need to rotate some players and bring a different game altogether to their quarter-final tie against France later on Friday. I will be watching it in the Mercedes motorhome after practice because I am watching every game and loving it. On course: Germany survived a scare before seeing off Algeria to reach the last eight .","Rosberg extended his lead to 29 points with win at Austrian Grand Prix .

"Throughout the United States Grand Prix weekend I was in very high spirits. Before the start of the season I didn’t know how I would feel towards the latter part of the campaign if I was fighting for the championship. For the most part however, I have been able to enjoy the moment and I am really happy about that. I have not been looking at the past. People have been asking me about my team-mate Lewis Hamilton’s rhythm, his good series of results and whether it puts me on the back foot. But I’m not thinking about that and I don’t have his history in my mind. Nico Rosberg says he is in positive spirits ahead of this weekend's Brazil Grand Prix . Rosberg (right) qualified on pole for the United States Grand Prix but eventually was second to Lewis Hamilton . Rosberg is trailing Hamilton by 24 points in the drivers standings . Rosberg has been a busy man speaking to the media ahead of Sunday's Grand Prix . In Texas I was in full-on attack mode and you could see that during qualifying. I was really comfortable and confident and I secured pole position. F1 however, is always about adapting and unfortunately in the race the track and the car was different and I could not find the rhythm as I had done 24 hours previously. It took me too long to adapt to the different circumstances and to nail my own performance. Also, when Lewis overtook me for the lead of the race on lap 24 I suffered with an electrical problem, which was unfortunate and largely down to bad luck. There are two ways for me to obtain more electrical power on my steering wheel; there is a button and a switch. Hamilton's (front) win was his 10th of the season as he battles for the Drivers Championship with Rosberg . Rosberg (left) cited an electric problem as the reason why Hamilton overtook him at the Austin, Texas track . As I went to defend my position I opted to go for the switch. Unfortunately I did not know that the button is immediate and the switch, which I pushed, isn’t. The switch increases the boost later during the lap, so when Lewis overtook me I did not have any electrical boost and that really caught me out. As we approached the corner, I was happy with the gap I had on Lewis. I thought to myself “OK, close the door a little bit and concentrate on braking”, but then I was surprised as he was much closer by the time we got to braking zone. In the last couple of metres, Lewis had closed the gap before breaking because he had full boost – which by the end of the straight was equivalent to 160 extra horsepower – and I did not, which was unfortunate. Four of five laps later I finally found my rhythm and then I was able to go for it and I really tried to push him as hard as possible but it was not enough. He made a couple of mistakes but not for me to get close to him or to create a chance to get by. It was tough result for me especially in the way that it happened. There is no worse outcome that starting the race from pole position but then being passed by a team-mate who is in the same car. In terms of disappointment, that is certainly the worst scenario. Rosberg took a break from preparing for Sunday's Grand Prix by riding his cycle around the track . Rosberg looked to be struggling as he checked his car in Interlagos . Of course the result makes it more difficult to win the championship. The title race was in my hands for most of the season, but now I need a little bit of help. That said there are still 75 points available from the final two races and there is so much that can happen in F1 that I still have all the belief and that is what is important for me. Trip down memory lane . It is pouring down in Brazil and it looks as though it will stay that way for the entirety of the weekend. For me that is a good thing because a wet Grand Prix increases the chances of something unusual happening and that can only be good. Our car is simply awesome at every track we go to which is fantastic and very special. To have a car which is leading the field is so cool. For the past few years Red Bull and Sebastian Vettel and Mark Webber have been lucky enough to have that and now I can experience that which is the best feeling. When I arrived in Brazil this week it evoked the memories of Germany winning the World Cup earlier this year. Rosberg will use Germany's World Cup success in Brazil to try and inspire him to glory this weekend . Mario Gotze (right) scored the only goal of the game as Germany beat Argentina 1-0 after extra time in the final . The emotions of that special win against Argentina in the final and the subsequent celebrations have left me in a very positive frame of mind which I will draw from ahead of this weekend’s Brazilian Grand Prix. I will be at the track early on Thursday to review the data from the race in Texas. The engineers have learned a lot of things in the days since so we need to digest all of it and make the most of it for this weekend, the penultimate race of the campaign. On Wednesday I already started the Brazilian race weekend with a dinner with some engineers in a typical Churaskeria and had loads of meat. So i guess there will be some others to follow this weekend as usual.","Lewis Hamilton won the United States Grand Prix on Sunday .

"The Canadian Grand Prix was completely all over the place with so many things happening. We had a hybrid failure which was huge. The team thought that a problem of this kind would not allow us to finish the race because it affected both my brakes and the fuel. While the fuel turned out to be OK – but only just because we managed to save some under the safety car – looking after the brakes was a mission. During the race, we have to take care of the brakes anyway; even if the hybrid hadn't failed, it was still very critical. So, with the hybrid failing it became a huge issue, an almost impossible task from the point of view of the team, but we had to manage it. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Nico Rosberg exercising ahead of the Austria GP . Leading the way: Nico Rosberg managed to fend off the pack for the majority of the Canadian Grand Prix . Second best:  Rosberg on the Montreal podium with winner Daniel Ricciardo and third-placed Sebastian Vettel . It took a lot of time to get back into a rhythm with all these handicaps, but I eventually found that tempo and it was awesome to see that I could keep the whole pack behind, with not one, but two massive handicaps. I had to reduce the amount I was using the rear brakes, so that meant braking much more with the front brakes, and I also lost in excess of 100 horsepower with the loss of hybrid power from the engine. So to finish second was a really good result when you take all of that into consideration. To be honest, I was surprised I managed to keep everybody behind me for as long as I did.   I was banging in qualifying laps, really going for it, and the gap remained identical to the guys behind. I knew that if one of them passed me the whole train would get me. So I had to stay ahead of them. Looking back, it's funny because I did not know what position I was in. I was so slow, and I had a Force India, in Sergio Perez, behind me. I had also asked my engineer Tony Ross to reduce communication because I wanted to focus. I knew the job I had to do whatever position I was in. I had to keep the guy who was behind me, behind me. I only realised I finished second after the race, and I was pretty happy with that because I thought it was a lot worse! Our aspirations are of course to win and dominate, but in hindsight I am pleased with the result.   It was good damage limitation and what happened in Montreal shows we are not bulletproof when it comes to reliability. The team has put a lot of energy into resolving that however, and I am very confident that the team can sort out anything, and I am sure they will find a solution to what happened. I'll drink to that: Rosberg was pleased to have finished 2nd in Canada after a race plagued with reliability issues . I am now 22 points clear of Lewis in the championship. I feel the momentum has swung back a bit in my favour, and that is what I had to do, so I just need to keep it going now. The lead of the title race is certainly a good place to be in, but it is still early days and there is a long way to go. The psychological impact of beating Lewis to pole in Canada wasn't something I considered that much. Montreal is a track like any other, and on any other circuit if I do a good job then I believe I will be quickest. I did not approach it in a different way, or consider it to be a ""special"" track, or ""Lewis's"" track, because he has won there three times before. Battle: Lewis Hamilton (left) and Rosberg went toe-to-toe in Canada for the race win before the former retired . We will be bringing some updates on our braking system to the Austrian Grand Prix and that is great because it is a region where I still need to work on because I am not 100 per cent confident in that area. We have something new to try - we took an update to Montreal and it didn't work - so I am looking forward to testing it out in Austria because I always look forward to something that has the potential to improve our car. Other than that, I think the track will suit us, but at this moment in time any circuit suits us. We are just quick everywhere. But we must keep pushing because the opposition is also pushing. In Montreal the gap was not quite as big as we expected, particularly in qualifying. Selfie: The Spotsmail columnist entertains the Austrian crowd at the Red Bull Ring on Thursday . Cheer we go: Nico watches Germany in their opening World Cup game against Portugal . I am a massive Germany fan, so I've been loving the World Cup. The first game against Portugal - where we won 4-0 - was just so cool. It was awesome. It is so emotional to follow them and watch them play and they are the favourites now after that performance. I visited them in their training camp before they left for Brazil and you could see they were working well together and were enjoying a great atmosphere. Externally, there had been some negative press towards them, but internally they were very, very strong and it was a privilege to visit them ahead of the World Cup. We fear the Dutch, but Chile are one of the surprises of the World Cup. They have looked strong. Away from Brazil, I went to Ibiza for a training camp. I also took the engineers out to a track day in Bedford earlier this week. It was great for them to get a racing insight, and they all got to drive a proper single-seater car on their own so they could feel for the first time what it's like to be a Formula One driver. Maybe now they will show a little bit more empathy towards me! They had an instructor next to them for all the different experiences except for when they drove the single-seater car, so they really appreciated how difficult it is to listen whilst driving. That is a good thing, because now they will understand to keep the communication over the radio to me to a minimum during the races! We also took part in a big Mercedes-Benz commercial at Silverstone on Wednesday. They are using the F1 team to promote their road car technologies. We were filming with the race car out on track and did some funny things with the road car, too. VIDEO Hamilton and Rosberg test their football skills! Team bonding: Nico enjoyed a track day with his Mercedes engineers at Bedford Aerodrome earlier this week . The news about Michael earlier this week was great and was so nice to hear.

"At the last race in China it was great to see we were still as strong as we have been all season. For me personally, qualifying in the rain did not work out for various reasons; partly I didn't do a perfect job and partly some technical faults which meant I qualified fourth. In the race, I completely lost all the telemetry communication between the car and the engineers so the engineers could never see what was going on, which meant they couldn’t help me on track – I was completely on my own! Moving on up: Nico Rosberg speaks to the media on Thursday ahead of this week's Spanish Grand Prix . Battle: The German driver passing Sebastian Vettel en route to finishing second at the Chinese Grand Prix . The team, and all the engineers, are always following what is going on inside my car via telemetry. So during a race they help me with things like fuel consumption, tyre pressures, settings, the balance of my car - so at a pit-stop they can correct an imbalance – and brake balance. In China, I had none of that help.  So, I had to drive according to what I felt and had to handle things, like fuel consumption, on my own. Normally, they have sensors inside the tyres, too, which show my team what the pressures are at any moment in time. Tyre pressures are really, really important for the car performance, so I was hugely compromised. They also couldn't set the clutch setting, which you need to start a race, so I had a terrible start and ended up way down in seventh after the first corner. From then on I fought my way back through the field, and it was great to still finish the race second – it was the perfect damage limitation after a very sub-optimal weekend because so many things went wrong. It shows how good our car is and how good our team is. Champagne moment: Rosberg celebrates on the podium with Lewis Hamilton and Fernando Alonso . We've had a three-week break so there has been a lot of time for the teams to develop their cars – which this year, more than ever, will be a very fast development race – so we are expecting everybody to bring much faster cars to this week's race. The Spanish Grand Prix is always a milestone in the season; if you are quickest here then it is likely that you are going to be the quickest for many more races to come. I have spent time in the factory this week working with the guys and I had a big talk with the whole factory on Wednesday just to say 'thanks' and to give them some insight into what is going on. I was also in the simulator, preparing for Barcelona and the race weekend.  Barcelona is, of course, a track that I know better than any of the circuits. I have driven here so much because we usually do all of our winter testing here. I like the track and it should suit our car which leaves me optimistic for the weekend. I went well here last year – I secured pole position – so everything is pointing towards a good weekend ahead. My team-mate Lewis Hamilton has come off three wins in Malaysia, Bahrain and China now, so it is important to try and break his momentum, turn it around, and get the win myself this weekend, so I am aiming to do just that. Team game: Mercedes are bidding for their fourth straight one-two finish at this weekend's Spanish Grand Prix . I went to the opening round of the DTM championship in Germany last weekend. While I was there, it was a great pleasure to drive five-time world champion Juan Manuel Fangio's 1954 Mercedes. Georg, my PR manager, had the idea of doing a 'selfie' while I was driving, and the video and photos turned out really well. Nobody has done that before, so that was a new one! I am proud because when driving Fangio's car you clearly see the history of the Silver Arrows in Formula One which is just massive. On track: Rosberg takes a 'selfie' whilst driving Juan Manuel Fangio's Mercedes W196 at Hockenheim . Compatriots: Rosberg poses with Lukas Podolski . In between races I spent time with my friends, family and fiancee, trained and re-energised for the European season. I also met Lukas Podolski, one of Germany's best players. I played some soccer with him on the river in Cologne. I'm huge fan of football, so it is always great to meet the players. Lukas is an easy-going and a nice guy. He was telling me that Arsenal still have the FA Cup final against Hull to come which is a big thing for them. And in terms of the World Cup he is very excited and he is looking forward to that. I will be meeting the Germany team in their training camp after the Monaco Grand Prix so that will be lots of fun, too. Last week marked the 20th anniversary of Ayrton Senna's death, but we mustn't forget that two drivers lost their lives at the 1994 San Marino Grand Prix. Roland Ratzenberger was killed in qualifying on a tragic weekend for the sport. I find it unfortunate that it is always just Senna who is mentioned because he had a bit more success.  That said, Senna is a legend of the sport and one of the best of all time. It was a great loss. I remember the weekend very well. I was sitting in Monaco in our kitchen waiting for many, many hours with my mum and cousin, listening to the radio for an update. Because of that awful weekend, the safety in the sport has moved on massively. There was a big push after that, and we are still benefiting from it today. We need to keep pushing because the sport needs to be safer and safer, but it is going in the right direction which is fantastic to see.

"At the last race in Barcelona, I was out there to win, but unfortunately it didn't quite work out for me. I narrowly missed out on pole position to Lewis in qualifying, so my next chance was at the start of the race, but I didn't get away well and that is a weakness of our team at the moment. From then on, I was quicker than my team-mate during the race which was positive, once again, but in Barcelona it is very, very tough to follow the car ahead and not only that, but to pass the car ahead, too. You also have to factor in that we both have the same cars and identical machinery. Chasing: Nico Rosberg was faster than Lewis Hamilton in Barcelona but it's a very tough track to overtake on . In the lead: Hamilton has now won four races in a row - but Rosberg hopes to break his dominance . So, we tried everything with the strategy, and the team gave me the best-possible chance to have a good chance of winning at the end of the race. The only way for the guy behind - which was me in this case - to have a chance of overtaking is to get a big speed differential at the end of the grand prix. So, you do that by taking on the hard Pirelli compound in a longer middle stint, and then finish the race on the soft, option tyre with a shorter stint. Whereas the other guy - which was Lewis - would have the hard compound tyre in the final stint. ‎ . This strategy is slower on total race time, but if you are quicker but stuck behind - as I was - it gives you the best possibility to overtake. I said after the race that I needed one more lap to give it a shot at overtaking Lewis and that was definitely the case because it was so close. The race was just one lap too short for me. ‎ . Too short: One more lap and the German driver would have had a shot at overtaking Hamilton . It was amazing to see that not only did we retain our dominance in Spain, but maybe we even extended it, and that was spectacular from a team point of view and really showed that we have come of age and that we are really are becoming a serious force in F1 which is great and hugely impressive. I don't believe that our dominance however, is having a negative impact on the sport. Of course, I like having a quick car, but even at the races where Mercedes have been faster than the rest we have seen exciting races, like in Bahrain and Barcelona where Lewis and I are battling each other. It is a fresh start for the sport and a change from the dominance of Red Bull and Sebastian Vettel, and I think that is a good thing for Formula One. Dominance: Mercedes have now won the opening five races - but that is not a negative thing for the sport . Of course it is important to stop Lewis because, at this moment in time, he has the result momentum and I need to try and break that this weekend. The Monaco Grand Prix is very different to any other race. It is just that little bit more intense, and more spectacular with the track, the atmosphere - it is right in the city - and the fact that it is just amazing to drive. There is always loads happening, especially for the team and the sponsors and I also have my friends coming down for the weekend. I have a friend's birthday party on the Thursday, so I will be spending time with my mates, and with the race team doing numerous sponsor events. Monaco is my home town, too, and I have great memories of winning there last year, so I am looking forward to racing there again. It is just the ultimate driving challenge. To get it right on a Monaco lap is so difficult, so in my opinion, there is no tougher track on the calendar. Winner: Rosberg celebrates his brilliant win at Monaco last year - the race is his favourite on the calendar . Victory: The Monaco race was one of two wins for the 28-year-old last season . As a team we are really thinking about the sport and we want to make it better. At last week's test in Barcelona, we trialled this 'trumpet' exhaust but unfortunately it did not have the effect on the sound when we took to the track as it did when we tested it back at the factory. So, everybody needs to keep working on it. The noise is an important part of the sport, and I understand that the fans want more sound so the sport has to find a solution. Trumpet: The 'trumpet' exhaust did not produce the desired noise, and everyone will keep working on it . I spent last weekend at the Le Mans MotoGP which was really cool. It was the first time that I have been to a MotoGP event and it is very exciting to watch. The racing is spectacular and the machines are unbelievable; they are so fast! But it is not something I would ever like to have a go at. The risk, for me, is just one step beyond what I would be willing to take to have fun, so I think I'll stick to my race car. It was amazing to meet Valentino Rossi and some other drivers and to watch their starting procedure. Spectacular: Rosberg spent last weekend at the Le Mans MotoGP with the likes of Valentino Rossi . On the grid: Rosberg poses with Oxford-born rider Bradley Smith, who eventually finished 9th . I also managed to watch Bayern Munich's cup triumph over Borussia Dortmund. We won 2-0, and I saw the game with my whole family on the television. We had a bit of a lucky break to be honest, because Dortmund scored - the ball was well over the line - but it didn't count because the referee didn't think it had gone in. It was still great to get the victory, because winning is all that matters, but that said, they are not at their best, and they need to turn things round again. Bayern's manager Pep Guardiola has done a great job, but somehow the team has lost its touch. Double: Nico was also at the Olympic Stadium in Berlin to watch Bayern Munich win the DFB-Pokal Cup . Over in England, you also had the FA Cup last weekend, and three Germans, Lukas Podolski, Per Mertesacker and Mesut Ozil, were part of the winning team for Arsenal which is fantastic for the World Cup because it will give them a huge confidence boost ahead of this summer's tournament. I will meet our boys in the training camp next Tuesday to do some photo shoots and marketing activities with Mercedes-Benz. I always look forward to joining them before a big tournament. It’s nice to exchange thoughts and get some impressions of how their training is going.

Despite being quicker than Lewis during the race it is very tough to follow and pass the car ahead on that track .
Because of our tyre strategy, one more lap in the race and I could well have overtaken Lewis .
Mercedes' dominance is not having a negative impact on the sport .
The Monaco Grand Prix is an amazing race to drive - there is no tougher track on the calendar ."
"I had a good feeling about my home grand prix at Monaco because obviously we have had a fast car this season. The big question was whether any of our rivals would get closer to us, and while that was the case, we were still absolutely dominant and that was fantastic for the team. The result of qualifying was hugely important because it is vital to start from pole around the tight streets of Monte Carlo. Of course, there was an issue where I left the track in my final run which brought out the yellow flags. I made a mistake, went off the road, and then I found out they wanted to investigate the incident to see if I had done it on purpose. So, that was quite awkward, and I didn't see it coming. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Hamilton and Rosberg all pally in funny video . Winner: Nico Rosberg celebrates his victory at the principality with his fiancee Vivian Sibold . Error: Nico Rosberg took to the escape road after making a mistake at Mirabeau during his final run . However, I understood why the . stewards would wanted to look into it because of the circumstances, and I . was confident that the incident would be quickly dismissed. It was clear . by looking at the data that every thing I'd done on the lap in question . had been very similar to my previous laps. It was obvious that I had done . nothing on purpose. The . running order during qualifying is taken in turns between myself and . Lewis at each weekend – one weekend I choose whether I run first or . second on the road, the next weekend it's Lewis. In Monaco, it was . actually my engineer who made the call because I didn't answer when he . asked me. So he took the decision, determined what was best for us and . so I went out first. Starting . from pole was obviously the best place to be in Monaco, and we got a . great getaway for once. We have worked a lot on our starts because it . was a weakness, but we have made great progress on that which is hugely . important for the remainder of the season. From . then on in it was vital to control the tyres and the pace of the race. My team-mate was always directly behind me applying as much pressure as . he could to try and force me into a mistake. So, it was not an easy . grand prix with him right behind me the whole time. Toe-to-toe: Lewis Hamilton finished second behind his Mercedes team-mate in Monaco . I . made sure I did not wear out the tyres because that was the one thing . that could have caught me out, and by the end of the race I had really . good pace and managed to pull away from Lewis to get a clear gap and win . the grand prix which was a fantastic experience. To . win in Monaco for the second time in as many seasons was unreal. So, we . had a great party, at several locations, in the evening. We . started on the beach and then I went for dinner with Prince Albert . which was a very special experience. Obviously, that sort of thing . doesn't happen every day, and being a local resident in Monaco made it . even more special. I . made a speech in front of everybody and there were huge fireworks . display which they announced in my honour; all of which was pretty . crazy. We then carried on the party with all of my friends so that was . awesome and we all had a great time. Champagne moment: Nico Rosberg celebrates his second victory in as many years at the Monaco Grand Prix . I . am quite neutral about my relationship with Lewis Hamilton. It is . always going to be the case that you have some difficult times which . will be followed by good times. Our strength is that we always talk . about what has happened and go through things as we did when we were . both 14. It is always going to be like that, and indeed it continues to . be like that. Lewis . issued a tweet last week commenting on our friendship, and that we'd . spoken. I don't want to go into that detail of what was said, but be . sure that when there are difficult moments we discuss them and move on, . so there is nothing out of the ordinary in any way. Old friends: Rosberg and Hamilton have played down the intensity of their rivalry for this year's championship . On the Tuesday after my win in Monaco . we went to Germany's World Cup training base, and there was a very . serious incident where two people got injured. For everybody involved it was an extremely shocking experience. Since . then, we have been trying to take care of the people who were injured . together with Mercedes and the German national team as much as possible. I don't want to go into too much detail about what happened because I . want to maintain my full focus on the race weekend in Canada. Shock: Two people were injured in a serious collision involving Rosberg after he'd been to the Germany camp . This . week is the Canadian Grand Prix, and Montreal is the highest fuel . consumption track of the year and the most difficult to get to the end . of the race within the 100kilogram limit. That is something that we must . pay attention to. I have worked on it during the simulator and it is . all under control. That will be one of the main challenges of the . weekend. I arrived . into Montreal on Wednesday and we had a couple of nice commitments . straight away in the evening. The first was a charity appearance for the . Sainte-Justine Hospital and Girafonds here in Montreal. The Foundation . is collecting money to help finance Pediatric Thyroid Illness Research . and make it sustainable. Today, one child in 2,700 suffers from . congenital hypothyroidism. This is one too many. Then later on, we had a massive team dinner on Wednesday night which . was always good. The whole team booked out a steak restaurant for . everybody which was awesome. It is always great to get some private time . and share some time with them, so we could relax a little bit and talk . with all the guys who work so hard at the race weekends. We are in the middle of the most incredible roll right now and making history for Mercedes each weekend. But . everybody in the team knows that being successful depends on getting . every detail right. One of those details is the team spirit and we are . enjoying our success but also working hard to keep our feet on the . ground. We are six races into the season and there is still a very long . way to go… . Nico . Rosberg's fee for his column will be donated to the Grand Prix .
