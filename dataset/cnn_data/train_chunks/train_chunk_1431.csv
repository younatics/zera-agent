"A teenager who went out clubbing in Manchester with his mates woke up in Paris the following morning after booking a flight in the early hours. Luke Harding was getting a cab home from the Tokyo Project nightclub, nicknamed Tokes, in Oldham when he found his passport in his pocket and drunkenly decided to visit the Eiffel Tower. Mr Harding, a sheet metal worker, asked the shocked taxi driver to head immediately for Manchester Airport then booked a last minute 6am flight for £100 through Flybe to the French capital using his mobile phone. Good night out? Luke Harding took a picture of himself in front of the Arc de Triomphe after he ended up in Paris following a night out in Oldham, Manchester . The 19-year-old eventually woke up in a toilet cubicle at Charles De Gaulle Airport - 500 miles from where he started his night to remember. Pals nursing a giant hangover from a night out at the club were stunned to see a sheepish Luke had tweeted a picture of himself standing next to the Eiffel Tower and then another with the caption: 'Sat outside the Arc De Triumph (sic) eating a croissant.' News of his unexpected excursion spread like wildfire around the social media site with many messages poking fun at the travelling teenager. In a series of tweets from Paris, Luke said: 'Only woke up in the toilets of Charles de Gaulle airport an hour ago and half of Oldham know haha.' He added: 'I got in a taxi to Manchester airport and booked a flight on my phone! Don’t remember the flight. It’s f***ing expensive here though. Mum thinks I’m a pillock. Walked past the Eiffel Tower 3 times! Not a clue where I am!' He was eventually picked up 12 hours later at Manchester by friends when he had to pay out a further £170 to get a flight back to the UK. The entire escapade cost him a total of £300. Just going for one drink... Luke says he went for a quick pint at the Tokyo Project, Oldham, with a mate after work but ended up travelling hundreds of miles when he drunkenly booked a flight to France . Random: Luke Harding (left) decided he didn't want to go home after dropping his mate off in a taxi and went to visit the Eiffel Tower . In further tweets Mr Harding, who had been using his passport as ID to drink at the nightclub, added: 'My flight home wasn’t till 7.30 at night I had to stay in Paris! Plus spent all that money to get there be a waste not to stay. My mates didn’t believe me! Bizarre thing to do going Paris but it happened. 'Always out in Manchester won’t be taking my f..king passport that’s for sure.' Speaking today, he said: 'It all started off just going for a pint after work with one of my mates, one thing lead to another and we decide we are going to go out to Tokyo’s in Oldham. 'It turned out to be just a bog standard night and we started to get a bit bored and decide to call it quits and head off home. The only thing was by this time we are well and truly plastered. Trip: Luke Harding decided to go to Paris after a night out in Oldham, Manchester . 'I went to drop my friend off at his house in a taxi but for some reason I randomly decided that I don’t want to go home but stay out instead. 'I found my passport which I’d been using for ID and was looking at this flight app on my phone and it was saying something like ""cheap flights to Paris"". 'I decided the best thing to do was book a flight to see the Eiffel tower. It was just a spur of the moment thing and seemed like a good idea at the time. 'The taxi driver asked me about where I was going and what I was going to do in Paris but I couldn’t bring myself to tell him I was a drunken idiot who spontaneously booked a trip to Paris, so I sold him some story that I was a junior doctor going to a convention.' Travelling light: Luke snapped this picture (left) before he boarded the flight. He said he tried to act as sober as possible when he checked in. After he woke up at the airport, he caught a bus into Paris and wandered around taking pictures (right) Mr Harding said the idea to go abroad had only struck him in the cab, so he didn't even have a bag or a change of clothes. 'I arrived at Terminal 3 and walked through to the check In where I tried and acted sober as I could and speaking as little as possible.' He continued, 'I had no luggage and I remembered the lady at the check in asking if I had any - then she joked that I was travelling light. 'I don’t recall much of the flight because I fell asleep and then the next thing I know I find myself lay next to a toilet in a cubicle in the middle of Charles De Gaulle airport and thinking what the hell have I just done? 'When I woke up I initially didn’t know where I was but then I remembered a bit about being in Manchester airport and booking the flight to Paris - and thinking ‘oh sh*t.’ Sightseeing: Luke had a coffee and a croissant outside the Arc de Triomphe but could not go up the Eiffel Tower because there was a big queue . 'I rang my mum and said ""don’t panic mum but can you pick me up at Manchester Airport at 8pm?"" Then I told her what I had done and she went mental at me. 'I had eight hours to kill so I booked a bus into Paris and had a wander around. I did get to see the Eiffel Tower but there was a massive queue so I didn’t get to go up it but at least I had my picture taken outside the Arc de Triomphe and I went to a cafe for coffee and a croissant and sat outside. 'It was great but it was bloody freezing, it’s warmer back here. It cost an arm and a leg but I don’t regret it. It’s a funny story to tell my mates for years to come.' Luke was inundated with messages from Twitter uses amused by his escapade. Mark Ingham said: 'I’ve ended up in a few scary places after a night out in Tokes but never Paris. Take a bow.' Dale Harris said: 'Don’t even know Luke Harding but I want to shake his hand.' Manchester Airport declined to comment about the incident. Flybe said they were unable to provide a comment.

"Back to jail: Steven Powell, seen in an old mug shot, is serving 40 days in jail for failing to get treatment . Steven Powell, the father-in-law of missing mother Susan Powell, has been sent back to jail for refusing to get sexual deviancy treatment as he awaits child porn charges, it has emerged. A Washington state judge ruled that the 64-year-old, who is from Tacoma, must go back to jail for at least 40 days, RadarOnline reported. Saturday will mark five years since his daughter-in-law Susan vanished in Utah, which means she will be declared legally dead. Her husband, Josh Powell, was long considered a person of interest in her disappearance but was never charged in the case. Tragedy struck for a second time in 2012 when Josh Powell attacked the couple's two young sons with a hatchet and then burned down his Graham, Washington home, with him and the boys inside. In 2012, authorities searched a home he had previously shared with his father, Steven Powell, and allegedly found that the elder Powell had child pornography in his possession. In May 2012 he was convicted of 14 counts of voyeurism for taking photos of two young neighbor girls in the bathroom and was sentenced to serve two-and-a-half years in June 2012. He got out of Washington State prison in March after finishing up his sentence. But last month, prosecutors refiled a charge of possession of child pornography against him after an appeals court determined that the charge was wrongly dismissed during his original trial. Family: Josh Powell, the son of Steven Powell, is pictured with wife Susan and their sons, Charles and Braden. Susan Powell will be declared legally dead on Saturday, the fifth anniversary of her disappearance . In court: Steven Powell, pictured in court in 2011, spent two years inside for taking explicit photos of two young girls who lived next door to him. He was released earlier this year but has headed back to jail again . On his release from prison, Powell was ordered to complete a sexual deviancy treatment program and undergo a psycho-sexual evaluation. He was also ordered to stay away from places where juveniles are typically found such as pools, parks, playgrounds and schools. In July, police found Powell in a Jack in the Box fast-food restaurant and he was sentenced to nine days in jail for visiting an establishment frequented by minors, according to police reports. In August, Powell's counselor 'terminated treatment' because Powell refused to cooperate with the psychosexual evaluation, according to the report. His parole officer determined he was being 'manipulative,' and he was sentenced to three days in jail. Powell again refused to answer questions about his sexual behavior during treatment in October, according to the report. His parole officer recently asked the judge to sentence him to another 60 days behind bars, saying that he poses a 'continued risk to the community' for failing to undergo the treatment. Tragic: Josh Powell, who was long suspected of killing his wife, attacked his two sons with a hatchet and then set his home in Graham, Washington (pictured) on fire, killing him and the boys, in February 2012 . On Saturday, it will be the five-year anniversary of Susan Powell's disappearance - which means she will be declared legally dead under Utah law. Josh, 36, is suspected to have killed his wife, although family members have voiced their belief that Steven was complicit in her presumed death. Thousands of images of Susan Powell were seized from the home that Steve Powell was sharing with his son in 2011 by police serving a search warrant. The images - some sexually suggestive - showed the missing Utah mother walking in public, doing the laundry or sitting in her car, apparently unaware that someone was taking her picture. Steve Powell has never been charged with any crimes related to images of Susan Powell. The Weekend of December 6 and 7, 2009 - Susan Powell, then 28, is last seen at the West Valley City, Utah, home she shares with her husband Josh and their two sons. Josh Powell tells police that he decided to take his boys on an impromptu camping trip that night in the middle of a blizzard but returns home to find his wife gone. December 24, 2009 - After two weeks of investigations during which Braden and Charlie confirm the camping trip, Josh Powell is named a person of interest in his wife's disappearance. Josh's father, Steve, tells the media he thinks Susan skipped town with a man from St. George, Utah, who also vanished from a party the same night she was last seen. January 2010 - Josh Powell decides to move with his two sons to Puyallup, Washington, which is where he and Susan grew up. He has now begun to tell the media his wife was 'extremely unstable' and was mentally ill. August 18, 2011 - Investigators working on a lead travel to abandoned mine shafts in Ely, Nevada, 200 miles away from West Valley. However, nothing is found. August 20, 2011 - At a remembrance service for Susan, Steve Powell and her father Chuck Cox engage in a public shouting match in which Powell calls Cox a 'liar'. August 25, 2011 - Forenisc investigators remove three computers from Josh Powell's home and Steve Powell claims that Susan made sexual advances on him that were 'a little beyond the pale'. September 14, 2011 - Authorities in Utah find a shallow grave in a mountainous region which they believe could contain the remains of Susan Powell - the site, near to Topaz Mountain is 30 miles from where Josh said he took the boys camping. September 22, 2011 - Steve Powell is charged with child pornography charges after the computers removed from his sons house reveal incriminating evidence. September 23, 2011 - Steve Powell and Josh Powell are issued with an injunction preventing them from publishing any material from Susan Powell's journals. September 28, 2011 - Josh Powell's sons are removed from his custody and placed with Chuck and Judy Cox because they are living in a home with sexually explicit material. He is, however, granted visitation rights with his boys. February 1, 2011 - Josh Powell is ordered to take a psychosexual evaluation and polygraph test to regain custody of his boys. Police note that there is information and images on his computer that 'specifically related to their children's welfare.' February 5, 2012 - Josh Powell sets off an explosion at his Washington home that killed himself and his two sons. He is also believed to have attacked the boys, then five and seven, with a hatchet. May 2012 - Steve Powell begins a prison sentence for 14 counts of voyeurism after images showed he took explicit photos of two young neighbors in their bathroom. February 11, 2013 - Michael Powell files motion attempting to have his brother's $1.5 million life insurance policy which he was a beneficiary of paid out. May 2013 - Police announce their investigation into Susan's disappearance is closed and release the documents. March 2014 - Steve Powell released from the Washington state prison after serving 30 months. October 2014 -  Steve Powell arrested on reinstated charges of possessing child pornography. December 2014 - As the five-year anniversary of his daughter-in-law's disappearance is marked on Saturday, he will be serving 40 days in jail for failing to get sexual deviancy treatment.","The father-in-law of missing Utah mother Susan Powell has headed back to jail for 40 days after failing to get treatment .

"Hershey is looking at replacing the high-fructose corn syrup in some of its products with sugar. Will Papa, chief research and development officer at The Hershey Co., said the company uses a mix of sugar and high-fructose corn syrup in its products but that it is 'moving more toward sugar.' 'We take into account what consumers want. And consumers are telling us between the two, they prefer sugar,' Papa said. Under review: Take 5, PayDays, Almond Joys and a York Peppermint Pattys are examples of Hershey's products that use corn syrup . A switch to sugar would make Hershey a high-profile example of the move away from high-fructose corn syrup in the food industry. Many people say they avoid it because it has gained a bad reputation for fueling weight gain and diabetes, though health experts says there's not enough evidence to conclude it's any worse than regular sugar. In an emailed statement, Hershey said its work on 'exploring' the replacement of high-fructose corn syrup 'is just under way' and that it did not have a timeframe on when it might be complete. A representative for Hershey, Jeff Beckman, cited Almond Joy, Fifth Avenue, Take 5 and York as examples of products that use corn syrup. He said classic Hershey bars are made with sugar. 'Our aim is to be transparent with our consumers about the ingredients we use in our products. Once we have more information to share, we will be back in touch,' Hershey said in its statement. Other products that have changed from high-fructose corn syrup to sugar include Gatorade drinks and Yoplait yogurt. As for health, the American Medical Association has said there's not enough evidence to specifically restrict the use of corn syrup. The Center for Science in the Public Interest, which advocates for food safety, has also said that there's no evidence that the sweetener is any worse nutritionally than sugar. The Corn Refiners Association, an industry group, has been pushing back at the negative perceptions about high-fructose corn syrup, which is generally cheaper than sugar. In 2010, the association submitted an application to the Food and Drug Administration to have its sweetener renamed 'corn sugar' on nutrition labels. The request was denied. The association said it has also commissioned market-research firms Mintel and Nielsen to study perceptions of sweeteners and shared the results online. Unchanged: Classic Hershey bars have always been made with sugar . For instance, the group notes in media materials that '67per cent of consumers agree that moderation is more important than specific sweetener types.' John Bode, president of the Corn Refiners Association, said in an interview that the number of companies changing from corn syrup to sugar has slowed. Still, he said consumption of high-fructose corn syrup has declined more than other sugars. Part of the reason is that people are cutting back on soda, which he said accounts for a majority of the market for high-fructose corn syrup. In some cases, he noted that companies have switched back from sugar to high-fructose corn syrup after failing to see a notable sales spike. Hunt's Tomato Ketchup switched to sugar in 2010, but then switched back to high-fructose corn syrup in 2012. Lanie Friedman, a spokeswoman for ConAgra Foods, said demand for the version without high-fructose corn syrup wasn't 'as strong as expected.' She noted the company still offers a 100per cent Natural line that uses sugar. Among the members of the Corn Refiners Association are agribusiness companies Archer Daniels Midland, Cargill and Tate & Lyle.","Take 5, PayDays, Almond Joys and a York Peppermint Pattys are examples of Hershey's products that use corn syrup .

"A Perth man who masked the fatal shooting of his de facto wife as a suicide has been found guilty of her murder. Robert Jeffrey Anderson shot Phaea Leanne Lightfoot, 51, in the bedroom of their Wanneroo home, north of Perth, during an argument about sex on August 29, 2012. The West Australian Supreme Court heard that the couple, who met at a swingers club before striking up their relationship nine years ago, often argued about Anderson's inability to perform sexually for Ms Lightfoot, the ABC reports. Robert Jeffrey Anderson has been found guilty of murdering his partner Phaea Leanne Lightfoot at the West Australian Supreme Court (pictured) After Ms Lightfoot had died, Anderson placed the gun beside her body and told the triple-zero operator and police that she had killed herself, recordings played to the court revealed. However when his trial began, Anderson admitted to shooting Ms Lightfoot, but claimed he had only intended to fire a warning shot through the bedroom door after she threw a ceramic cat at him. He also denied intentionally placing the gun beside the body to make it appear like a suicide and rehearsing his story before calling for an ambulance. Justice Michael Corboy said there had been a clear intent to at least cause injury, if not to kill. 'There was a deliberate shot fired at Ms Lightfoot and Mr Anderson was aiming to hit her as he fired,' he said. Prosecutor Nick Cogin described the victim as a 'highly sexualised female' with an anger problem. 'She had a drug habit and was known to consume cannabis regularly. In addition she consumed methylamphetamine,' Mr Cogin said, according to the ABC. He told the jury that her relationship with Anderson was a 'servant, slave relationship' in which she did as she was bid. Anderson will appear in court again for sentencing submissions on January 23.","Robert Anderson shot Phaea Lightfoot after an argument about sex .

"A bargain hunter more than he expected from an auction when he discovered  $127,000 in bonds hidden inside a desk he bought for $40. Phil LeClerc, of Weymouth, Massachusetts, found an envelope of the savings when he was looking through the dresser for a missing knob. He had bought the Governor Winthrop secretary desk at a Holbrook auction house on November 19. Lucky find: A bargain hunter got a lot more than he expected from an auction when he discovered more than $127,000 in bonds hidden inside a desk he had bought for $40 . A son was selling his father's home and furniture to pay for the assisted-living facility he was moving into. LeClerc was searching for a missing knob that had fallen into a space between desktop and the drawers when discovered the white paper envelope. 'I banged the desk forward and when the knob came out the envelope dropped,' LeClerc told The Enterprise. Inside was a stack of bonds that matured in 1992. 'The first piece I saw was $500 and that was enough to shake me up,' LeClerc told the newspaper. By the time LeClerc finished counting the bonds, they totaled $127,000, he said. Discovery: Phil LeClerc, of Weymouth, Massachusetts, found an envelope of the savings when he was looking through the dresser for a missing knob . Six were worth $10,000 each. 'First I said, 'Oh, this can't be real. This doesn't happen,' he said reports the Boston Globe. 'It was really a fluke that it was found. If I wasn't looking for the knob … I never would have found it.' Upon realizing the value of his discovery, LeClerc contacted the auction house to try to return them to the original family. 'The family had been looking for them for years,' Marg-E Kelley, who works at the auction house said. The family which owns the bonds requested that their name not be used. Governor Winthrop desks have developed a reputation over the years for hiding long-forgotten items in the secret drawers and compartments that fill the desks.","Phil LeClerc, of Massachusetts, found an envelope of the savings when he was looking through the dresser for a missing knob .

"A six-week-old baby suffocated and died in his sleep after his parents took him into their bed when they returned from a night out. Paul Pearson, 24, and 22-year-old Emily Lambert put their son Noah in a Moses basket next to their bed when they arrived back at their home in Bradford, West Yorkshire, at 3.30am on May 31. When Noah woke up crying at 5am, Mr Pearson took him from the basket, fed him and carried him into their bed, where he cradled the young boy between him and Noah's mother until he fell asleep. Noah Pearson (pictured left and right) died aged six weeks after suffocating in his parents' bed in Bradford when they returned from a night out with friends . But four hours later, Mr Pearson woke up to find his son lying unconscious, with blood coming from his nose. Mr Pearson immediately called an ambulance, but Noah was pronounced dead at Bradford Royal Hospital. At an inquest into the baby's death, a doctor called Noah's death a 'tragedy' and warned other parents of the dangers of sleeping with their babies in their bed. Bradford Coroners' Court heard Noah died from Sudden Infant Death syndrome (SIDs) after being deprived of oxygen. But the coroner said a contributory factor in Noah's death was 'co-sleeping and parental alcohol consumption', as well as over-heating. After the inquest, Miss Lambert's father Mervyn Lambert called for a national campaign to raise awareness for babies in bed and alcohol consumption. Noah was taken to Bradford Royal Infirmary (pictured) after his father found him unconscious, but he was pronounced dead on arrival . He said: 'I have brought up three children and they have been perfectly healthy and all have shared our bed. 'It is terrible what has happened obviously and my daughter and her partner are heart-broken as are we all. 'I would like to see a national NHS campaign to raise awareness for babies in bed and alcohol consumption.' But Miss Lambert said she had just one glass of wine before the incident unfolded. She said: 'We're not big drinkers and we don't drink a lot. Sudden Infant Death syndrome describes the unexpected death of a baby or toddler that is initially unexplained. Cot death was a term commonly used in the past. It has largely been abandoned, due to misleading suggestions that sudden infant death can only occur when a baby is asleep in a cot. Causes of SIDS may include accidents, infections, congenital abnormality or metabolic disorder. It is common in babies aged between six and eight weeks. For those deaths that remain unexplained, experts believe there are likely to be undiscovered causes. SIDS statistics: . Source: The Lullaby Trust and Office for National Statistics . 'The last time we went out was on holiday - a year before I had the baby. We just wanted to go out for a bit - I only had a glass of wine.' The inquest heard how an initial joint paediatric and forensic post-mortem was carried out at Sheffield Children's Hospital. Neither could find a cause of death. Consultant paediatrician Dr Eduardo Moya told the court the incident had been a 'tragedy' at the no-one had been 'at fault'. He said tests had shown there were no abnormalities in the baby's organs, which pointed towards Sudden Unexpected Death syndrome. But the doctor also said that the parents' decision to co-sleep with their baby and having consumed alcohol might have contributed to their baby's death. He said: 'This was a tragedy and there is nobody as fault but I believe it is important to know the etymology of SIDS. 'These are contributory factors because we don't know the ultimate cause of SIDS. I pass my condolences on to the family. 'It was clear to me when I went to see them that nobody did anything wrong or deliberate. It was an unfortunate tragedy.' Dr Moya had told the hearing that there had been a number of contributing factors to Noah's death. He said: 'The not deliberate and unfortunate set of circumstances is well-documented - bed sharing with parents combined with alcohol consumption. 'Furthermore one or both parents did smoke and that could be a contributory factor as that baby had a rhino viral infection. 'There are a series of risk factors that increase the likelihood of having SIDS. One reason bed sharing is considered dangerous is that one parents could roll on to the infant in the middle of the night. 'I think the most dominant would be bed sharing with two adults. 'Next would be alcohol consumption. Alcohol enhances fatigue through the night and it could reduce the level of mental awareness in the parents.' He also said that over-heating is another factor that increases the chance of a baby dying of SIDS, before adding: 'In my personal view it should be recorded as SIDS with co-sleeping and alcohol consumption. 'The reason I say this is that this is important. If we know how many cases there are with enhanced risk factors and what they are this can help with promoting a campaign for safe infant care.' Earlier Coroner's officer Malcolm Dyson read a statement summarising the events that led up to Noah's death. He said: 'Noah's parents went out to socialise while his grandmother baby sat. 'The couple returned home at 3.30am the following morning and went straight to bed. At 5am to 5.30am Noah woke up crying. His father has made him a bottle and then placed Noah between himself and Noah's mum. 'He has then fallen asleep and then woken by the sound of a mobile phone ringing at 8.48am. When he woke Noah was still between them.' He added: 'Noah's father noticed dry blood around his nose and on the bed. He noticed something was wrong. The emergency services were called and Noah was transferred to hospital. However he sadly passed away.' Assistant Coroner Dominic Bell recorded a narrative verdict, describing it as a 'tragic day' for the family. He said: 'SIDS is considered applicable and it is likely that there are a number of contributory factors of the circumstances that have been described. 'In order of contribution - bed sharing, parental alcohol consumption, rhino virus, smoking and over-heating. This is a tragic day for the family.'","Emily Lambert and Paul Pearson put Noah in a Moses basket next to bed .

"The fiancee of a man who claimed to be Henry Ford's illegitimate grandson has told a court she  only discovered his secret life of prostitutes and drugs when she found him murdered in their home. The blood-soaked body of John Dahlinger was found by his long-term fiancee Melanie Yanchuk in their marital bed at their condominium in Grand Rapids, Michigan. Pimp Danyell Thomas, 37, is accused of conspiring with a prostitute to drug and rob the 56-year-old before shooting him dead. Dahlinger's late father has always claimed he was the illegitimate son of Henry Ford following an alleged affair the car manufacturer had with his young secretary. Murder: John Dahlinger, 56, was found dead in his bed by his longtime fiancee Melanie Yanchuk at their condominium in Grand Rapids, Michigan (both pictured) Accused: Danyell Thomas (left) is accused of murdering Dahlinger in October 2013. He was allegedly shot after he could not pay prostitute Dijana Kilic (right) after she performed a strip tease at his home . In court Yanchuk wept as said she far as she knew her partner, a father-of-two, did not use drugs and did not use prostitutes. 'I would have no reason not to trust him. He was a good man,' Yanchuk said reported MLive. 'We were together 99 percent of the time.' Yanchuk told of the moment in October 2013 when she found her partner of 24 years dead, saying: 'He must've tried to apply pressure to the wound (with a towel). 'It was just saturated in blood.' She said she pulled the towel away from his face but 'it really wasn't a pretty sight, so I immediately put it back.' 'His face was all bashed in and it was covered in blood.' Hidden: In court Yanchuk wept as said she far as she knew Dahlinger, a father-of-two, did not use drugs and did not use prostitutes . During opening statements, Kent County Assistant Prosecutor Chris Becker told jurors that Dahlinger hired prostitute Dijana Kilic, to perform a lingerie show while he took drugs. Kilic met the 26-year-old through a stripper friend in early October, reports WZZM. She claimed Dahlinger said he owned a pornography website and a strip club in Detroit and he wanted her to work for him. But his fiancee said he had lost his job in sales and he was working from home to start a new venture. Thomas served as Kilic's pimp as well as the father of her child and her boyfriend. Kilic, who pleaded guilty to armed robbery and was sentenced to one year in prison, agreed to testify against Thomas. Court: During opening statements, Kent County Assistant Prosecutor Chris Becker told jurors that Dahlinger hired prostitute Dijana Kilic, (pictured) to perform a lingerie show while he took drugs . Charges: Thomas (pictured in court)  faces life in prison without the possibility of parole, if convicted of felony murder, conspiracy to commit armed robbery and felony use of a firearm . She told a court earlier that she did not have sex with Dahlinger, but he paid her $300 an hour to watch as he took cocaine. Becker told jurors that on the death of his death Kilic was 'doing a lingerie show, changing clothes, putting different clothes on.' 'Part of the plan was to get him so high on drugs, to get him to pass out so they could steal his money at that point in time. But that didn't work,' he told the jurors. Kilic sent a text message to Thomas after Dahlinger was unable to produce another $300 when their time together entered a second hour, according to earlier testimony. Thomas arrived and pointed a gun at Dahlinger and asked 'where's the money?' she previously testified. Kilic said she left the bedroom and went into the kitchen, when she heard a single shot. Dahlinger died of a gunshot wound, blunt force trauma and a heart attack, a medical examiner determined. Two days after Dahlinger's murder, a friend of the family, who chose to remain anonymous, offered a 'substantial' reward for information leading to the capture of the person or persons responsible. The victim's mother, Barbara Dahlinger (who was married to John Sr.) has confirmed the claim that her son was the illegitimate grandson of Henry Ford. 'Yes, my husband was the illegitimate son of Henry Ford,' she told Detroit News. 'So what if it's true? Everybody knew it back then. It's just old crap. I lived it. My son lived it. And there's nothing to be gained by rehashing all this again. The Ford Motor Co. owes us nothing.' Ford Motor Co said in a statement after his death: 'We extend our deepest sympathies to the Dahlinger family for their loss, and we trust that those involved will be brought to justice. 'As this claim dates back many decades and has never been proven to be true, it would serve no purpose for us to speculate further.' Kent County Circuit Judge Paul Sullivan sentenced Kilic to five years' probation and ordered her to serve a year in the Kent County Jail for conspiracy to commit armed robbery. She has now been released. As part of the plea agreement, Kilic's testimony cannot be used against her. According to the Kent County Prosecutor's Office, part of the plea also deal included allowing Kilic, a Bosnian immigrant, to stay in the country. She had been warned previously that her conviction could mean deportation. Thomas faces life in prison without the possibility of parole, if convicted of felony murder, conspiracy to commit armed robbery and felony use of a firearm.","John Dahlinger, 56, found dead in his bed by fiancee Melanie Yanchuk .

"This is the shocking moment a drunk Russian driver ploughs into pedestrians on a zebra crossing scattering them like skittles in a bowling alley. But another driver, whose car was fitted with a dashboard camera, helped capture the hit-and-run driver, who, after slowing down for a second, suddenly put his foot down and sped away. The shocking footage which was taken in the city of Volgograd in southern Russia shows the three victims, a 23-year-old young woman and 23-year-old man as well as a 51-year-old woman walking across the zebra crossing. Gegham Mkhitaryan appears to slow down after crashing into the pedestrians . Other traffic was stopped but the car driven by the 40-year-old local man Gegham Mkhitaryan decides to overtake the stopped vehicles, and as it crosses back onto the road in front of the queue ploughs into the three people on the zebra crossing. For a second they are seen frozen in the headlights before the car hits them like skittles and sends them flying through the air.

The young woman who was battered to one side manages to scramble to her feet and staggers to the side of the road, but the other two are left lying lifeless at the intersection of Raboche-Krestyanskoyand Street and Profsoyuznoy Street. The hit-and-run driver meanwhile initially seems to slow down but after seeing one of the bodies lying in front of the car, hits the accelerator and speeds off. One of the people rises to their feet, but two are still down, lifeless . With shocked people watching on, the callous driver hits the gas and speeds off . The whole incident was captured by a fellow driver who had a dashboard camera . But the number plates of the SUV Ssangyong had been captured on the dashboard camera of the car at the zebra crossing and it was quickly handed to police that allowed them to identify, track down and arrest Mkhitaryan, who was found to be intoxicated. He told police he had no idea how many people he had it and had fled because he was scared of being punished for drink-driving. Police said that the 51-year-old woman was in intensive care although the young man had been treated at hospital and also released along with the young woman.","Three victims left lying in road on Russian zebra crossing .

"There was a time during last year’s Manchester derby at the Etihad Stadium when it seemed as though the world might be about to fall in on David Moyes and his United team. Three goals in eight minutes spanning either side of half-time left United four adrift with 40 minutes still to play. Ultimately, the game ended 4-1, an early low in a season that was to have many. Certainly it appeared last season that the balance of power in Manchester had tilted City’s way and pretty much stayed there. The gap was big and looked set to get bigger. Sergio Aguero celebrates scoring for Manchester City as they thumped United at the Etihad last season . Manchester City supporters unfurled a banner about the under-fire David Moyes during last year's derby . United boss Louis van Gaal was all smiles during the session as he embarks on his first Manchester derby . Juan Mata, Michael Carrick, Wayne Rooney, Ander Herrera and Robin van Persie (left to right) train . Radamel Falcao misses out again having been sidelined for the draw with Chelsea at the Etihad on Sunday . 2013-14 - United 0-3 City, City 4-1 United . 2012-13 - United 1-2 City, City 2-3 United . 2011-12 - City 1-0 United, City 2-3 United (FA Cup), United 1-6 City . 2010-11 - City 1-0 United (FA Cup), United 2-1 City, City 0-0 United, . 2009-10 - City 0-1 United, United 3-1 City (League Cup), City 2-1 United (League Cup), United 4-3 City . Fast forward 13 months from that day in M11 and City have much to be pleased about. They have two trophies — one of them the Barclays Premier League — and a new training ground standing in the shadow of a stadium that is undergoing expansion. Oddly, though, United and their new coach Louis van Gaal will travel from their base at the Lowry Hotel on Sunday morning sensing an opportunity of sorts. There is no swagger about City at the moment, no joy. Their coach Manuel Pellegrini looks like a man with a permanent migraine, and his players look leggy and fretful yet it is only November. City start as favourites. They are the champions, they are at home and they have match-winners in their team. United, though, can see chinks of light through the City barricades and perhaps sense it’s time to remind their upstart neighbours that this remains a two-club town. ‘In a tactical way I know what we have to expect,’ said Van Gaal. ‘It is not the greatest moment of Manchester City, and I have said that we are growing and developing ourselves. We have a good feeling about this match.’ If City’s problem is that they have appeared a little flat during a three-game winless run, Van Gaal fears his team may suffer from an excess of energy. Robin van Persie’s late equaliser at home to Chelsea last Sunday felt like a significant one in the context of United’s season and Van Gaal expressed concern that it may have set adrenaline levels running a little too high. Manchester City manager Manuel Pellegrini has watched his side really struggle in recent weeks . Manchester United captain Wayne Rooney has been suspended since his red card against West Ham . Wayne Rooney (United) - 11 . Joe Hayes (City) - 10 . Francis Lee (City) - 10 . Bobby Charlton (United) - 9 . Colin Bell (City) - 8 . Eric Cantona (United) - 8 . Brian Kidd (United and City) - 8 . Joe Spence (United) - 8 . ‘For the fans it is unbelievably big as a rivalry and I have felt that also with a lot of the players in the squad this week,’ he said. ‘Especially with Ryan Giggs because when he presented the analysis of Manchester City, I felt more tension with him. It was good to see that. ‘He knows it, he has the experience as a player and now maybe as an assistant manager. But we don’t have to accelerate this feeling because it is football and you have to play the game, not only a game with emotion but also in a tactical way. That is what we are doing, that is how we are preparing. ‘Ryan has transferred the idea of emotion and I have transferred the idea of how we have to play.’ Certainly it’s hard to imagine anyone ever accusing Pellegrini of being emotional. On Friday, the City manager was as reluctant to add to the hyperbole that usually precedes a Manchester derby. Van Gaal admitted to having been impressed by Ryan Giggs' intense presentation on Manchester City . Spanish playmaker David Silva will miss the derby after coming off injured against Newcastle United . Yaya Toure faces a fitness test on Saturday to determine whether he'll face Van Gaal's United the day after . All 20 Premier League clubs will have this poppy on their shirts either this weekend or next to commemorate the centenary of the First World War. Clubs wear poppies on their shirts each year but for 2014, the Royal British Legion has approved a one-off Poppy with the citation ‘1914-2104 Football Remembers’ written underneath. That, of course, is the Chilean’s prerogative. It is not his responsibility to add to the sideshow, only to find a way to improve upon recent performances. With David Silva absent and Yaya Toure facing a fitness test on Saturday, Pellegrini certainly has his work cut out. City were wretched against Newcastle in the Capital One Cup on Wednesday and, in truth, it was a performance that had been coming. ‘I don’t know what pressure is,’ insisted Pellegrini. ‘I think it’s very difficult to analyse the season at this moment when you are only in October and you have only played nine games in the Premier League. I think always you have better moments and bad moments in the season. ‘If you review last year (and compare it with) what we are doing at this moment, I think we were not playing better than today and the criticisms were exactly the same as they are today... it’s not good to do it but normally all the teams have the moment in the season when you are not in your best moment.

Angel di Maria appeared in a relaxed mood during Manchester United's training session on Friday . Marcos Rojo (left) and Antonio Valencia could be two of many South Americans involved at the Etihad . The return of Rooney (left) to the line-up is likely to mean Mata (right) will be dropped to the bench against City . Marouane Fellaini has had a resurgence in recent weeks, and could start against City on Sunday . ‘It is important for it to be at the beginning of the season and not at the end of the season. I’m sure our team will be a strong team again.’ Van Gaal was not present when City lost on Wednesday. He sent assistant Marcel Bout to the Etihad instead. Their preparations for this game began in earnest early last week, though, when Van Gaal called Wayne Rooney, his captain, back to the training ground unexpectedly one afternoon. ‘I have heard that he has scored a lot of goals against Manchester City, the most of any player,’ said Van Gaal. ‘I said that to him to stimulate him but he doesn’t need that. I am very happy that he can play again and he shall play.’ Rooney was the only United player who performed at the Etihad last season. He will need some help on Sunday. If he gets it, then United — the underdogs — have a chance. United attempt to regroup at the Etihad during last year's 4-1 defeat by their cross-city rivals .

"Israel has furiously warned that the French parliament's vote in favour of recognising Palestine as a state will 'harm the peace process'. France's lower house of Parliament voted today 339 votes to 151 to urge the government to recognise a Palestinian state. The vote is non-binding. Instead it is seen as a symbol of hope for the Palestinians, as support grows in Europe for two states.

Since then, Britain, Spain and Ireland have approved non-binding motions urging recognition. Last week members of the European Parliament began debating whether they can agree on a common approach for the European Union's 28 member states.

"A mother hippo appears to show off her new hairstyle after emerging from a swim wearing a glamorous wig made out of weeds.

"Jeb Bush revealed that a decision on his presidential ambitions is coming 'in short order' Jeb Bush revealed that a decision on his presidential ambitions is coming 'in short order', as he spoke out to condemn President Barack Obama's recent immigration order. The former Florida governor said he will make up his mind based on whether he can 'lift people's spirits and not get sucked into the vortex', and whether 'the sacrifice for my family is tolerable'. He said: 'I'm thinking about running for president. And I'll make up my mind in short order - not that far out in the future.' 'I don't know if I'd be a good candidate or a bad one,' Bush continued. 'I kind of know how a Republican can win, whether it's me or somebody else, and it has to be much more uplifting, much more positive, much more willing to be practical...' Bush, who is the son of one former president and brother of another, also blasted Obama's immigration order for going 'way beyond' what other presidents have done. He reiterated his support for a pathway to legal status for those immigrants who are in the U.S. illegally. But he said Obama may have exceeded his constitutional authority by unilaterally lifting the threat of deportation from millions of such immigrants last month. 'The idea that, well, Reagan did it, my dad did it - they did it on a much smaller scale and they did it with consent of Congress. There are a lot of differences,' Bush said on Monday night at the Wall Street Journal's CEO Council, an invitation-only event in Washington featuring some of the nation's most powerful CEOs. Speaking publicly about the order for the first time, Bush said Obama's move 'makes it harder' for Congress to adopt lasting immigration reform. 'It's a shame,' he added. The former Florida governor is seen as the early favorite of business-minded Republicans eager to reclaim the White House in 2016. While he would be a force in the Republican presidential primary, Bush would face criticism from the party's conservative wing unhappy with his positions on immigration and education reform. Those who attended Monday's event, however, include many political donors and Republican business leaders who support a more forgiving immigration policy. Jeb Bush, who is the son of one former president and brother of another, also blasted Obama's immigration order for going 'way beyond' what other presidents have done . Bush was seen chatting with News Corp. head Rupert Murdoch, who has urged lawmakers to adopt a pathway to legal status for immigrants who are in the country illegally. Two of the last three Republican presidents - Ronald Reagan and Bush's father, George H.W. Bush - also extended amnesty to family members of immigrants who were not covered by the last major overhaul of immigration law in 1986. Obama's executive order has drawn a withering response from Republicans, but also has laid bare divisions within the GOP over how to deal with immigration. The issue is seen as critical for the GOP ahead of the 2016 presidential contest as party officials work to attract more Hispanic voters. The comments come as Bush works this week to keep his public profile high. Jeb Bush (right) hugs his brother former president George Bush at a Republican Party campaign event . Earlier in the day, he attended a Capitol Hill fundraiser for Republican Senate hopeful Bill Cassidy, less than a week before Cassidy faces incumbent Democratic Senator Mary Landrieu of Louisana in a runoff election that could increase the GOP's new majority. On Tuesday, immigration may come up again as Bush addresses the annual luncheon on U.S. Cuba Democracy PAC in Miami. The organization is a political action committee that advocates a tough stance on Cuba. Bush, whose wife is Mexican, told the CEO Council that he supports a nation in which people ultimately find no need to identify their cultural origin. 'That is the America we should aspire to - not the one where we're dividing ourselves up to find where we are different,' he said. 'But the fact that you're from a different place or you've got a different origin is totally irrelevant.'

"‘I was having agonising stomach pain and cramps,' said Denise Florance . Denise Florance worried something was seriously wrong for nearly ten years before she was finally diagnosed with womb cancer in 2012 and had to have a hysterectomy. She says her GP had failed to take her seriously because of her weight. ‘I was having agonising stomach pain and cramps,’ says the 43-year-old mother of three from Swansea, who at her heaviest was a size 26, weighing 18 stone (she is 5ft 6in). ‘My GP told me not to worry about it: “You’re overweight, that’s all,” he said.’ In fact, he was right: her weight was the problem — but for far more serious reasons than they realised. Excessive body fat is the direct cause of four out of ten cases of womb cancer, with the overweight (a body mass index, BMI, of 25 or more) at three times the risk of the disease compared with women of a healthy weight. These alarming figures were published last week by the World Cancer Research Fund in the journal Lancet Oncology. A high BMI significantly raises the risk of breast cancer in post-menopausal women as well as colon cancer. It also raises the risk of pancreatic, oesophageal (gullet) and kidney cancer in men and women. The scientists reported that 20,000 cases of cancer in Britain each year are directly linked to obesity. Maintaining a healthy weight would have made these cases ‘realistically avoidable’. Britain is second highest in the world after the U.S. for the proportion of cancers attributed to obesity. Yet quite how obesity raises the incidence of cancer is ‘the subject of fierce debate in the clinical and scientific community’, says Professor Nicholas Lemoine, director of the Barts Cancer Institute at Queen Mary University of London. One clue may lie in the fact that overweight women are more at risk than overweight men. A total of 13,000 women a year develop an obesity-related cancer, twice the number of men affected. It seems this is mainly because two female cancers lead the obesity-related league table: womb cancer and post- menopausal breast cancer. And the female hormone oestrogen — specifically after the menopause — may be to blame. Before the menopause, oestrogen is made by the ovaries to thicken the lining of the womb in preparation for ovulation, says Adeola Olaitan, a gynaecological oncologist at University College Hospital. Britain is second highest in the world after the U.S. for the proportion of cancers attributed to obesity. Yet quite how obesity raises the incidence of cancer is ‘the subject of fierce debate' ‘Each month, progesterone is also produced to enable the lining of the womb to be shed during the woman’s period.’ However, oestrogen is also made in body fat in women: the more fat cells she has, then the more oestrogen she produces. ‘After menopause, women with excess body fat continue to produce high levels of oestrogen and these act on the womb lining, but without the regulating effect of progesterone.’ It’s this that’s linked to womb cancer. High levels of post-menopausal oestrogen can also ‘stimulate abnormal breast cell growth’, which leads to more rapid development of oestrogen responsive breast cancers, says Dr Matthew Lam, senior research officer at Breakthrough Breast Cancer. This explanation is supported by major research programmes in the U.S. and Sweden since 2009, where scientists tracked obesity-related cancers in two groups of patients: one had bariatric (gastric band) surgery while the other did not. In the Swedish study, the women with a gastric band who had lost an average of 44lb were far less likely to develop obesity-related cancer. They lowered their risk by 42 per cent, compared with women who did not have gastric bands (and who gained an average of 3lb). This finding was replicated in the U.S. Yet the studies reported a different pattern in men — for whom oestrogen levels are not a factor in developing cancer. They found rates of cancer were not affected by weight loss brought about by gastric bands. Yet scientists admit they don’t understand the link between weight and cancer. The oestrogen hypothesis doesn’t explain why 60 per cent of women with womb cancer are not obese or why a significant number — like Denise — are diagnosed before menopause. Nor does it explain findings that before the menopause, overweight women have less risk of developing breast cancer than women with a healthy weight. ‘It seems the impact of having excess weight varies at different stages in life, but we don’t understand why,’ says Dr Lam. What’s more, the impact of fat varies according to where it is. The extra cancer risk to women has been shown to be caused by fat distributed across the body. Yet in men it appears to be caused by visceral belly fat — wrapped around organs in the abdomen — according to Tom Stansfeld, health information officer at Cancer Research UK. ‘Overweight men are at risk of oesophageal, rectal, colon and pancreatic cancer, affecting internal organs close to the stomach where men are most likely to carry extra pounds. ‘Fat cells secrete chemicals into the bloodstream constantly and it seems likely cancer in these organs is caused due to their proximity to visceral belly fat.’ Despite the evidence, doctors still aren’t taking seriously the risk of cancer from being fat. Take what happened to Denise. The symptoms of abdominal pain and cramping between periods are known symptoms of womb cancer. Yet though she spoke to her GP twice, there was never a suggestion she should have tests. In January 2012, she began to experience stronger cramping — ‘just like labour contractions’ — and severe pain. Two days later, she woke up in the early hours bleeding vaginally. ‘I was terrified,’ she says. That day, she was admitted to a gynaecological unit for tests. But once again, she says ‘it felt as though no one was taking it seriously because I’m big’. A fortnight later, she was told she had womb cancer. Two months on, Denise had a radical hyster-ectomy, involving removal of the womb and ovaries. She didn’t need chemotherapy or radiotherapy. The hysterectomy brought on the menopause, causing her to have hot flushes and feel low. The group Womb Cancer Support UK has been a great comfort, she says. She has also lost two stone. So, what’s to be done to help Denise and the thousands of people who develop cancer as a result of being overweight? The proportion of people aware that staying a healthy weight reduces the risk of cancer . Cancer charities stress the importance of a healthy diet and lifestyle, but it may be that more radical action is needed. Last week, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) updated its weight-loss surgery criteria, with a call for bariatric surgery to be offered to anyone with a BMI of more than 35. Dr Andrew Renehan, of the Department of Surgery in the School of Cancer and Imaging Sciences at Manchester University, welcomes the surgery recommendation as a proven method of reducing the risk of obesity-related cancers for women. ‘The obesity epidemic is not abating. 'We now have proof that for women we can reverse the effect of obesity on cancer risk,’ he says. Womb Cancer Support UK wombcancersupportuk. weebly.com .

"Interview: Chris Rock was speaking to New York Magazine ahead of the release of his new film . Comedian Chris Rock has hit out at the gap between the rich and poor - while giving an interview to promote his $12.5million new film. Rock was plugging Top Five, an upcoming release in which he is director, screenwriter and lead actor, when he said if the poor saw true luxury 'there would be riots'. Speaking to New York Magazine for an extended interview, Rock said the only reason revolution hasn't come is that 'people don't even know' how the other half live. He told interviewer Frank Rich: 'If poor people knew how rich rich people are, there would be riots in the streets.' 'If the average person could see the Virgin Airlines first-class lounge, they’d go, “What? This is food, and it’s free, and they... what? Massage? Are you kidding me?”' Airport lounge customers who fly Virgin are treated to unlimited cocktails, food on demand, and other amenities including free haircuts and spa treatments. The comments came as Rock, who lives in an exclusive New Jersey community and is worth $70mllion according to CelebrityNetWorth, built momentum for his latest commercial venture. He spoke about a frenzied bidding process when the film first screened at a festival in Toronto, prompting bids from competing networks, resulting in an 'unheard of' windfall. Riots? Rock said if poor people saw the first-class lounge service on offer flying with Virgin they would riot. Pictured above is Virgin Atlantic's lounge at London Heathrow airport . He said: 'All the buyers are there. All the critics are there. I believe the bids were coming in before the movie was over. '...Everybody’s on the phone all night, essentially. It’s like election returns. It’s at 6. It’s at 10. You know what I mean? A lot of money for a film at a festival is like $3 million, so for a movie to sell for $12.5 million is unheard of.' Rock has spoken out in the past about income inequality, saying he would voluntarily up his tax contribution if it would save him giving a loan to his children's teachers. In a 2012 interview, Rock said: 'I can pay higher taxes and people can have jobs or I can pay lower taxes and I have my kids' teacher asking me for a loan because she's going to lose her house - which is true'. 'Stuff like that happens, so I'm going to lose the money no matter what.'

"Some vulnerable elderly people are sent a different carer every week to look after their most personal needs, a think-tank claimed yesterday. In some cases, it said, frail pensioners must allow 50 people a year into their homes to help them with vital everyday care such as dressing and washing. The problem has resulted from a high turnover of care workers, according to an inquiry commission headed by former Care Minister Paul Burstow. ‘Some care recipients have reported having 50 different care workers in their home over a year,’ it said. Some pensioners being looked after in their own homes are seeing up to 50 different workers a year (file picture) The claim follows deepening concern at the 15-minute visit system that many care workers funded by local councils have to work under. These strict time-tables leave them no more than a quarter of an hour with each elderly person they are helping. Vulnerable residents can be given different carers each week in areas where the firms that supply care services are unable to recruit enough staff, said the commission. It examined a diary kept by an anonymous care worker in the North East, saying: ‘Although she is familiar with most of the people she sees and can provide continuity of care, some of her time is spent covering areas where the company she works for is short-staffed. ‘This means that she is unlikely to have seen these people before and may never see them again. ‘She becomes part of the parade of unfamiliar workers who may come into someone’s bedroom and bathroom and take care of their intimate personal care needs.’ Staff turnover at care provider firms is running at 20 per cent a year, twice the average for firms in all sectors of the economy, said the inquiry led by the former Liberal Democrat minister. One reason for discontent, it said, is that 220,000 out of 685,000 carers are paid only for the time they spend inside people’s homes. Travel from one home to another is not included. ‘This means that where there is significant travel time between appointments, particularly in relation to the amount of paid- for contact time, care workers’ effective wage can be less than the minimum wage,’ said the commission. Former care and support minister Paul Burstow's damning report says that the service – designed to free up beds by keeping people out of hospital – is ‘not working’ ‘This is illegal. To make matters worse, it is also common practice for compassionate care workers to give a little extra time to their clients when care slots seem inadequate. ‘While this is the kind of person we would want to look after an aged parent, this puts their effective hourly wage further at risk.’ Pay is depressed further as zero-hours contracts are used for six in ten care workers, the report said. It called for councils to pay more so staff receive the ‘living wage’ of £9.15 an hour in London and £7.85 outside. This means local authorities would have to pay £21.33 an hour to firms employing carers in the capital and £18.59 elsewhere, said the report. Thousands of dementia patients living in their own homes are not getting enough help from carers or their GP, another report has warned. Almost half do not feel they are supported by their family doctor – or offered regular check-ups. A fifth are not given enough help with basic tasks at home such as cooking and washing and the same proportion feel they have no control over their lives. Dementia Action Alliance – an umbrella group of charities behind the report – is calling for an overhaul of dementia care. Issued by the Local Government Information Unit think-tank, it added that care workers should be better trained and their jobs held in higher regard. It also called for them to be given ‘key worker’ status to help them find housing. The Local Government Association, which represents councils, said: ‘We rely on care workers to keep our social care system running and support people who can often have complex needs. ‘It is important they are paid a fair wage and have the best possible training and local authorities understand and take account of the cost of providing this. ‘The backdrop of 40 per cent cuts to local government funding during the current Parliament and increasing pressure from Government to drive down the costs of care have forced councils to ask providers to run services on tighter margins.’ The call for care workers to be paid the living wage comes at a time when even employers sympathetic to higher pay are finding difficulties putting this into practice. Last year, the Church of England admitted that it employed 70 workers on less than the living wage in its sheltered housing scheme for retired clergy.","Lib Dem MP Paul Burstow warned the home care system is facing crisis .

"Qatar lifted a travel ban on Tuesday against an American couple cleared in the starvation death of their eight-year-old adopted daughter. U.S. officials put pressure on Qatar's government to  allow Los . Angeles couple, Matthew and Grace Huang, to return home. An appeals court threw out . convictions linked to the death of their African-born adopted . daughter, Gloria, after finding that a lower court had made . errors in the case. However, on Sunday, the couple's passports were seized at Doha airport . as they sought to leave the Gulf Arab state after a new arrest warrant was issued. Scroll down for video . Matthew and Grace Huang were acquitted of parental neglect over the death of their adopted daughter by a Qatari appeals court in Doha on Sunday. They will return to the U.S. on Wednesday . The Huangs told the court that eight-year-old Gloria (pictured front right) died of medical problems complicated by unusual eating habits. The couple have two other African-born adopted sons (left) However U.S. Ambassador to Qatar, Dana Shell Smith, said on Tuesday that the travel ban had been lifted and the couple would be leaving for the U.S. on Wednesday. Secretary of State John Kerry had swiftly issued a statement . saying he was deeply concerned over the complications after Qatari officials refused to allow the couple to leave on Sunday. On Monday, State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said that the U.S. ambassador to Qatar had visited with the . couple on Sunday and had been in touch with Qatari officials to . get the travel ban lifted. On Monday, a lawyer for the couple filed an application . requesting the travel ban be lifted. The application . was presented to the attorney general's office in Doha, a family spokesman said. The Huangs were arrested in January 2013 after an autopsy . found their daughter died of 'cachexia and dehydration'. Cachexia is an irreversible loss of body mass. They were charged with 'murder with intent by forced . starvation' and convicted in April. The couple said Gloria had suffered from . malnutrition-related diseases since they adopted her from Ghana . at aged four. A website created to publicize the case said the Huangs had . moved to Qatar so Matthew, a Stanford-trained engineer, could . work on a project related to the 2022 World Cup. Western-style adoptions and cross-cultural families are relatively rare in  Qatar where the family had been living while Matthew Huang, a Stanford-trained engineer, worked on a project related to the 2022 World Cup . The Huangs have two other African-born adopted children and have been pressing Qatari officials unsuccessfully for permission to leave the country to be with them. 'It has been a long and emotional trial for me and my family, and Grace and I want to go home and be reunited with our sons,' Matthew Huang said shortly after the ruling. 'We have been unable to grieve our daughter.' Western-style adoptions and cross-cultural families are relatively rare in Qatar, which has aggressively pursued a higher international profile through sporting events and overseas investments. A report by Qatari police earlier raised questions about why the Huangs, who are of Asian descent, would adopt children who did not share their 'hereditary traits'. It also suggested that the children could have been part of a human trafficking operation or were bought for organ harvesting, according to the family's website. Gloria was severely malnourished when she was younger and would at times refuse to eat for several days before binge eating or getting food from unusual places, such as garbage cans or from strangers, according to a report prepared in the U.S. by Janice Ophoven, a pediatric forensic psychologist who reviewed the case for the family. The report noted that such unhealthy anorexic eating patterns are not uncommon in children adopted from impoverished backgrounds, and was a behavior the girl's parents were trying to manage and correct. The report also noted that Gloria had previously been treated for an intestinal parasite, and said recent blood tests could have indicated she suffered from an underlying bone marrow condition, as well as a vitamin D deficiency. On Sunday the appeals court ruled the couple were not guilty and said they were free to leave Qatar, based on witnesses' accounts that Gloria was 'not neglected in leading a normal life.' In the appeals court hearing, the witnesses had testified that they saw Gloria eating one day before her death, the presiding judge said as he issued the verdict. 'This negates the charge that she was prevented from eating, a charge that the court of first instance used as a base for its initial ruling,' the judge said. The court also cited a statement by Gloria's brother, Immanuel, who testified that the parents had provided food to their children. A forensic pathologist told court last month that Gloria's corpse showed signs that she had not eaten for days. 'I found no signs of food in her stomach and the whole intestine, and I found no other reasons for death,' said the expert Anees Mahmud. But the Huangs have insisted that Gloria died of an eating disorder rooted in a troubled early childhood.

"Janice Dickinson has described in graphic detail how Bill Cosby allegedly drugged then raped her in a Lake Tahoe hotel room more than 30 years ago. The former supermodel, 59, broke down in tears in a live television interview accusing Cosby of using the offer of career advancement to lure her to a hotel room where he drugged her and raped her while she was unconscious. Dickinson, speaking on CNN on Monday night, said she recalled waking up in extreme pain with Cosby's semen staining her clothes, after which she fled. Tears: Dickinson, 59, broke down during the CNN interview, where she said Cosby had given her a pill which made her black out, and that she woke up after he raped her . Emotional: Dickinson said she trusted Cosby because he was married and because he had invited her to the hotel room in Lake Tahoe for ostensible professional reasons . 'Covered in semen': Dickinson recounted graphic details of the alleged encounter, after which she says she fled Lake Tahoe . She said she had not suspected Cosby, whom she now considers a 'monster', of any ill intent because he was married. Dickinson, who first claimed last month that Cosby had raped her, said that she was given wine and pills before blacking out at a meeting to which she had been lured with the promise of a part on the Cosby show. According to Dickinson, Cosby tempted her with red wine despite knowing she had just left rehab for alcoholism. 'I was alone with him', she said. 'I had menstrual cramp - he said ""I have something for that"" and he gave me a pill.' Accused: Cosby is pictured above in character for The Cosby Show in the 1980s . 'When I started to black out I had a Polaroid camera on me - I took several photographs. I just remember having him on me in my room the next morning. 'I remember waking up and that he - there was a lot of pain downstairs. There was semen all over me and my pajama bottoms were off. I just packed up and I got the hell out of there. 'I remember being extremely angry that I had been violated - I remember feeling disgusted at him, but I was disgusted at myself. 'I should have reported it to the Nevada police. I had crystal clear memory of this entire incident, of this rape.' She later returned to the incident, detailing aspects of the night she says she remembers. She said: 'He was wearing a bathrobe and a gold watch... and I remember the feeling in my vagina and my anus... I've not been the same since.' When confronted with Cosby's refusal, and lawyer allegations that her claims are made up, Dickinson angrily stood by her account. She said: 'I am Janice Dickinson and I am the world's first supermodel and this happened in 1982.' When her interviewer read a statement from Cosby characterizing the allegations against him as 'innuendo', she then accused him directly. Dickinson said: 'Screw you, Bill. You know damn well he's not going to take any responsibility. 'Innuendo? I say you raped me Bill Cosby, you raped me in 1982 in Lake Tahoe.' She also spoke at length about her reasons for trusting Cosby in the first place. She said: 'I do remember I was young i was innocent and I was very excited to get a call that I was going to be offered this job on the Cosby show and I trusted him. He was a married man.' '[I trusted him] because of his demeanor and the promise of a career. I had a successful career and wanted to take it to the next level.' Rebuttal: Cosby, pictured in Florida last month, has characterized the allegations against him as 'innuendo' Younger years: Dickinson (pictured) says Cosby told her he would get her a role on his show in the 1980s . When Dickinson told her story for the first time, it was met with a direct rebuttal from Cosby's legal camp, who called the account 'a fabricated lie'. The statement, published by Variety magazine, said: 'Janice Dickinson’s story accusing Bill Cosby of rape is a lie. 'There is a glaring contradiction between what she is claiming now for the first time and what she wrote in her own book and what she told the media back in 2002.' '...The only story she gave 12 years ago to the media and in her autobiography was that she refused to sleep with Mr. Cosby and he blew her off. Out and about: Janice Dickinson is pictured out with a mystery friend in Los Angeles before the interview on Monday . She was also photographed smoking and chatting on her phone while behind the wheel in Beverly Hills . 'Documentary proof and Ms. Dickinson’s own words show that her new story about something she now claims happened back in 1982 is a fabricated lie.' Dickinson is just one of the women who has come out in recent weeks to accuse the comedian of drugging and raping her. He has denied the allegations. In 2006, one woman, Andrea Constand, claimed Cosby had drugged and assaulted her in his Philadelphia mansion in 2004. Her lawyers gathered 13 other alleged victims who were prepared to testify against the comic, but the civil case was settled, meaning that they did not have to speak. An earlier version of this article suggested that Stu Gardner offered Janice Dickinson red wine before she was allegedly assaulted by Bill Cosby. We are happy to make clear that Mr Gardner did not tempt Ms Dickinson  or offer her red wine.","Former supermodel said she was given wine and drugged during meeting .

"A 20-year-old college student from upstate New York has been unfairly labeled a racist on social media after her vindictive ex-boyfriend posted vile messages in her name. Brianna Rivera, from Middletown, New York, woke up one morning last week to discover that she has become the subject of a viral Tumblr campaign intended to get her fired for being a bigot. But it has since been revealed that the real culprit was Rivera's ex-boyfriend, who posted a pair of racially charged status updates on his Facebook page in the woman's name. Framed: Brianna Rivera, 20 (left), became the subject of an online campaign to get her fired after her ex-boyfriend (right) wrote vile racist messages in her name on Facebook . Doppelganger: The ex changed his Facebook user name to 'Brianna Rivera' and uploaded her picture as part of the cruel prank . Fanning the flames: The jilted boyfriend wrote a pair of abhorrent, racially charged messages in Rivera's name commenting on the situation in Ferguson, Missouri . In an order to convince other web users that the abominable posts were coming from Brianna, her ex, who goes by the user name Mallo Fox, changed the name of his account to 'Brianna Rivera' and even included her photo, Gawker first reported. One of the status updates written in all caps on Rivera's behalf read: 'seriously everything in Ferguson is f***ed up. We bring the black people here give them a good life and this is how they repay us. Look at Africa it's still f***ing dirty and hut and ebola ridden but they still wanna complain and not be grateful that us white people brought them here and gave them jobs.' Around the same time, the spiteful ex wrote a second, even more shocking post referring to the killing of unarmed black teenager Michael Brown at the hands of white Ferguson Police Officer Darren Wilson. 'F*** all there ape n*****s in ferguson LOL. who cares about some thug dying. that officer did what he had a right to do and thats protecting us from more loser a** mother f*****s and apes.' The hateful messages eventually ended up on a popular Tumblr page called Racists Getting Fired. The social media forum has been created to out Internet users who post racially charged comments to their employers in hopes of getting them sacked. The pair of posts were accompanied by Brianna Rivera's personal details, including the town where she lives, the college she attends and her place of employment - AMC Theater at the Galleria Mall in Middletown. Playing with fire: The user shared the posts on the Tumblr account Racists Getting Fired in an apparent hope of getting Rivera terminated from her job as a movie theater supervisor . 'Coward': The Miami native, left and right, has since removed both his Facebook and Instagram accounts . The web vigilantes behind the Tumblr page encouraged users to call her work and get her fired over her hate-filled remarks about Ferguson. Before it was determined that Miss Rivera was the victim of a cruel prank, the campaign against her spread like wildfire, prompting strangers to contact Rivera's workplace and complain about her perceived bigotry. AMC Theaters took the incident seriously and issued a statement Friday in defense of Miss Rivera. ‘AMC was made aware of some highly offensive posts that were allegedly sent from an associate,’ the statement red. ‘An immediate and thorough investigation confirmed the social media account and highly offensive posts were fabricated by someone posing as an AMC associate. ‘This hateful behavior is dangerous and illegal. A police report has been filed, and we will pursue prosecution to the fullest extent of the law against the person or persons who committed these illegal acts.’ The Racist Getting Fired Tumblr has issued a profanity-laced retraction attacking Brianna Rivera's ex-boyfriend for defaming her and asking users to stop calling her employer. Speaking out: Miss Rivera posted a message on her real Facebook page to clear the air about the ordeal . The ex, a Miami native living in New York City, has since deleted his Facebook and Instagram pages. Seeking to clear her name once and for all, the 20-year-old criminal justice student also issued a statement on her real Facebook page about the unfortunate ordeal. 'I said none of those horrible words of hatred & racism. Anyone who knows me, knows I would never in my entire life say anything like that,' she wrote on Thanksgiving. 'I appreciate everyone who came to me and asked me first... And thank u everyone who is spreading the truth about it not being me.... ‘And as for the person who stole my identity, defamed my character and endangered not only my life but the lives of my friends and family, thanks.'","Brianna Rivera, criminal justice student from upstate New York, was framed by her ex-boyfriend on social media .

"Elena Butterfield, 26, has been cleared of being in charge of a dog which was dangerously out of control after her pet bit a police horse on the tail . When Elena Butterfield let her dog Louis off his leash in the park, she could not have imagined the chaos that would follow. An exciteable Louis, on seeing a police horse for the first time, bit it, signalling the start of a ten-month ordeal for Miss Butterfield, who said the experience made her feel suicidal. The young barrister was prosecuted under the Dangerous Dogs Act and told Louis could be put down. But after ten months of anxiety, it took magistrates just hours to clear her of any wrongdoing after they ruled she did everything possible to prevent the clash. Miss Butterfield, 26, sobbed as she described how a walk in Greenwich Park, South-East London, in January spiralled out of control. The University College London graduate said she had begun letting four-year-old Staffordshire terrier Louis off the lead only three months earlier. But when he saw horses ‘for the first time’, he ran towards them, wagging his tail. Speaking at Bexley Magistrates’ Court, Miss Butterfield said Louis turned aggressive when he was kicked by a horse and the police riders shouted: ‘Woman, control your dog!’ She said: ‘I called him immediately, but obviously he was distracted by this incredible creature he had never seen before. ‘I immediately ran over and called his name calmly, but assertively. He was just excited, I wouldn’t say he was fearful. Immediately the officers stopped the horses and shouted, “remove your dog!” I shouted, “Louis, come here!” ‘He was excited and distracted, but not showing signs of aggression. He was just curious and excited. Very quickly, the horses started kicking.’ Miss Butterfield said she feared for her safety as she tried to rescue Louis. ‘They were circling their horses, so I had to keep moving. I was worried I would find myself underneath the horses,’ she said. ‘They were absolutely furious. I said to them: “Please help me – I don’t know what to do. I’m trying to get my dog”. I actually begged them for help. ‘Throughout the incident, they were bawling at me: “Woman: control your dog!”’ A passer-by eventually intervened and tackled the dog before picking him up. Miss Butterfield said Louis calmed down as soon as he could not see the horses. The clash left a police horse called Quixote with an injury to his shoulder. Choking back tears, Miss Butterfield added: ‘It has really affected my confidence. I really just thought, “I want to throw myself off a train”. I felt like I had no way out because how could I defend myself in front of police officers?’ Asked if Louis liked people, she added: ‘That’s who he likes best of all. He just wants to cuddle you. He jumps into strangers’ laps. ‘He brings people together. He’s got charisma.’ Police horse Quixote was left with bite marks and bruising after the attack in Greenwich Royal Park . Police horse Quixote (left) suffered a wound to its shoulder, in the upper leg area. David Wilson (right) jumped on the dog and subdued it, successfully stopping the attack and allowing Ms Butterfield to put the lead on . Earlier Met Police horse trainer Alistair Blamire, who was riding Quixote, said the dog was ‘aggressive’ and ‘jumping up’. Speaking about Miss Butterfield, he said: ‘She didn’t seem to say much at all. I think she was very nervous and there wasn’t too much communication from her. ‘By this time the horse was becoming more and more agitated and . . . I was becoming more and more concerned – not only for the horse but also for me.’ Alistair Blamire (left) and PC Andrew Hill (right) left Bexley Magistrates' Court  after giving evidence yesterday. The two were out training their horses when the dog began barking at their animals and police horse Quixote . Magistrate Maureen Anderson cleared Miss Butterfield of allowing her dog to be dangerously out of control in a public place and owning a dangerous dog. She said: ‘We have read an expert’s report that your dog is not dangerous. We believe you did as much as you could under the circumstances that you could have.’","Police officers were training in a park when the dog attacked their horses .

Konika Dhar spoke out after her brother Siddhartha Dhar, who now calls himself Abu Rumaysah, reportedly posted a picture of himself on Twitter last week, holding his baby son in one hand and an AK-47 assault rifle in the other. Mr Dhar, 31, reportedly fled the UK while on bail in September, the day after being arrested in London with radical cleric Anjem Choudary. Scroll down for video . Konika Dhar says her brother Siddhartha Dhar, who reportedly fled the UK in September for Syria to fight with ISIS while on bail, had changed after converting to Islam and being radicalised by Anjem Choudary . Siddhartha Dhar uploaded this image of him posing with a gun and his newborn baby boy in Islamic State-held area of Syria. It ws posted with the hashtag Generation Khilafah – a reference to the so-called caliphate . Ms Dhar told ITV News that her 'kind and generous' brother had changed beyond all recognition since converting to Islam and being radicalised, and laid much blame at Choudary's door. In a message to her brother, Ms Dhar told the broadcaster: 'I'm sorry if you think Anjem Choudary is your role model because he's not.' She added: 'I still believe that being in prison would be better than where he (Dhar) is now and I want him to realise that as well because his perception of the repercussion is slightly distorted and not accurate and he needs to know that, it's not that bad and things will be okay if he just speaks to us and lets us in a little.' Mr Choudary was arrested in September with eight others, reportedly including Dhar, as part of an investigation into alleged support of the banned extremist group al-Muhajiroun. Ms Dhar says Siddhartha had wrongly seen the radical cleric Anjem Choudary, pictured, as his role model . At the time Mr Choudary said the arrests were 'politically motivated'. Speaking to ITV News today, he rejected criticism that he 'warped the mind' of Dhar, saying: 'If warping someone's mind and not being on a rightful path is believing in the sharia and wanting to bring your children up according to the sharia, then I am very happy to warp everyone's mind.' Ms Dhar said her brother was misguided if he was taking his moral guidance from the radical cleric. “I'm sorry if you think Anjem Choudary is your role model because he's not…You can do a lot better than Anjem Choudary… you’ve got it all wrong.” In the picture posted last week, Dhar was seen standing in front of a mustard-coloured pickup truck, wearing a thick military style coat and boots. He cradled the baby against his chest with his left arm, with his son’s face peeking out of a tightly-knitted babygrow. Dhar held an AK47-style assault rifle in his other hand, with the barrel pointing toward the sky and away from his child. The black IS flag is the Twitter account’s profile image. Siddhartha Dhar was one of nine men who were detained in September on suspicion of encouraging terrorism . Ms Dhar said the image with the hashtag Generation Khilafah – a reference to the so-called caliphate - had left her in disbelief after she viewed the photo. 'I was absolutely devastated and my heart goes out to my brother because I know it's not in him to be like that and I'm very sorry that is the image that is being portrayed but it's not right. 'Words can't describe how I feel and I'm absolutely devastated.' She added that Siddhartha had 'a big heart, he's kind, he's generous' but that his actions in Syria had left his family baffled. 'He's giving and he would do anything for anyone and he's funny as well, he's got a good sense of humour. 'And I don't know what's happened it's just escalated into this tragedy but it's still not too late I believe so I just want him to get in touch, we're all trying to reach out to him. 'It's been very hard. But we just need to know he's OK and he can still come home.'","Konika Dhar spoke out after brother Siddhartha Dhar posted Twitter photo .

"Alex Spirikaitis, 42, personally embezzled $4.2million, and enabled a $15million fraud . The former chief executive officer of a credit union in northeast Ohio has been found guilty of enabling $15 million fraud. Alex Spirikaitis, 42, was sentenced to 11 years in prison by a federal court in Cleveland on Monday. He had pleaded guilty earlier this year to one count of conspiracy to commit bank fraud. Spirikaitis was accused of personally embezzling more than $4.2million from the Cleveland-based Taupa Lithuanian Credit Union between 2001 and 2013 and misrepresenting credit union assets to regulators. He also enabled others to steal more than $10million of the credit union's $24million assets. Spirikaitis used his share of the stolen millions to build himself a $1.6million home in a Cleveland suburb, a luxury suite at FirstEnergy Stadium for Cleveland Browns' football games, and nine cars. Police confiscated a large collection of semi-automatic weapons, including a Thompson replica machine gun, five rifles and 45 caliber pistol. They also found more than 10,000 rounds of ammunition, stored at the credit union's Cleveland office. Spirikaitis requested a lighter sentence through his lawyer, as he has two special needs children, one of whom is severely disabled, wkyc.com reports. His lawyer, Darin Thompson, said a long-term prison sentence would put a huge burden on his ex-wife, who would become sole carer to their two children. Credit union CEO Spirikaitis, spent his stolen millions on a $1.6m home in an upmarket Cleveland suburb, nine cars, an arsenal of semi-automatic weapons and box seats to Cleveland Browns' football games . 'It's a fairly sad day when an individual uses the impairments of their children and their wife to benefit themselves,' U.S. District Judge James Gwin said according to wkyc.com. 'He knew going into this (fraud scheme) that he had kids with special needs. You had a credit union with $24 million in assets and he stole $15 million. He knew it was going to be discovered.' The National Credit Union Administration and the state of Ohio took over the credit union in July and placed it in receivership. It had about 1,150 members. Spirikaitus was sentenced to 130 months in prison and ordered to pay $15 million in restitution. Two others also were charged.","Alex Spirikaitis, 42, defrauded credit union in Cleveland, Ohio .

"It's been described as the Holy Grail for tea connoisseurs - and a cup will set you back £5. The pricey brew comes from India's Darjeeling Makaibari Tea Estate and there are only 420 jars of the rare tea on sale in the country. Moonlight Silver Tip's tea-leaves are harvested between midnight and 3am once every 108 years on a full-moon night in June. And each £50 12g jar makes just ten cups of tea. Moonlight Silver Tips' tea-leaves are harvested between midnight and 3am once every 108 years on a full-moon night in June. The rare tea comes from Makaibari Tea Estate in Darjeeling, India . A 12g jar of the Moonlight Silver Tips tea costs £50 . The high value is due to the small window of opportunity available to pick the leaves, which has to be done at the right celestial moment. And the weather conditions have to be perfect as well; the night the tea is picked has to be bright and clear. Mark Nicholls, tea taster at Hampstead Tea in London, where the jars can be purchased, said: 'The rarity of Moonlight Silver Tips is due to the optimum picking conditions occurring once every 108 years. 'This tea was picked during the summer solstice and a full moon, giving this rare planetary configuration. 'In addition, the tea was picked by moonlight, with the conditions of the night of 13th June, between midnight and 3am, optimal.' The white tea comes from the world's first biodynamic estate on the oldest tea plantation in Darjeeling. Biodynamic agriculture is a form of organic farming. Described as a holistic understanding of agricultural processes, it treats soil fertility, plant growth and livestock care as as ecologically interrelated tasks, emphasising spiritual and mystical perspectives. Moonlight Silver Tips tea has a light pale white sherry depth, with a delicate peachy flavour. The tea leaves benefit best from being brewed with filtered water.

At about £62 for 50 grams (25 cups), the leaves of this Chinese tea are painted with non-toxic 24-carat gold. They are harvested on one day a year with special golden scissors, and only from the top part of the tree. Panda dung tea . Reportedly costing £127 a cup, this tea from China is not actually made with panda poo but grown in ground that is fertilised by the bear's excrement. Pandas only eat wild bambo, of which 30 per cent is absorbed into their body. The rest of the nutrients are in their waste, which, according to connoisseurs, makes the tea taste of bamboo. Da Honh Pao . The half green-half black Da Honh Pao tea is similar to a heavy Darjeeling. The taste is described as rich and floral and lingers in the mouth several minutes after drinking. The £180 a pot tea is served at Royal China Club's restaurants in London. Gyokuro . A Japanese green tea made from ungrounded leaves also known as Sencha, the leaves are shaded from the sun before they are harvest. 100g of the super-exclusive tea costs £26. Tieguanyin . This Chinese tea costs £1,900 per kg. The Oolong tea leaf is robust and can be brewed up to seven times before it loses its flavour. The price  is steep because the leaves are kneaded before being put into cloth bags so  they make a pitch-perfect sound when they are poured into the cup.","Pricey brew comes from Makaibari Tea Estate, Darjeeling, India .

"It's been a British way of life for as long as most of us can remember, but its time could finally be coming to an end. After more than 800 years, the sit-down roast dinner with all the family is on its way out, a poll of 2,000 people revealed. Weekday and Saturday family meals in front of the TV are fast becoming the norm as lifestyle changes and prime-time programming take over from tradition. A poll of 2,000 people revealed that that the tradition of eating Sunday roast together as a family will soon become a thing of the past as more of us choose to eat together during the week or on Saturday . A new way of dining: 'Digital' eating - when family members fiddle with mobile phones, tablets and surf the web - is the modern way of bringing people together . But fears that traditional get-togethers around the dinner table are in decline are unfounded as more of us are eating together on weekdays and Saturdays . The Sunday roast is believed to have its origins in medieval times, around the 12th century - when village serfs were rewarded with roasted ox by their masters after church. According to energy firm SSE's Home of the Future Report, 80 per cent of poll respondents said they regularly ate with their families during Monday to Friday. On Saturdays, a total of 67 per cent said they sat with 'all the family' to eat dinner compared to just 58 per cent on Sundays. The report states: 'During the industrial revolution, lunch was the mainstay meal. 'The 1970s saw the rise of the microwave dinner. However most of us upheld the traditional roast on a Sunday until now. 'Today families prefer to eat together on weekdays and Saturdays.' The study showed that 80 per cent dine with their families on Monday through to Friday whilst 67 per cent eat together on a Saturday. Only 58 per cent of respondents take part in the traditional Sunday roast . SSE's Home of the Future Report found that 67% of Britons eat dinner in front of the TV . British futurologist, Dr James Bellini said it was not a 'death knell' for the family, stating that 'digital dinners' - when families sit around the TV, fiddle with mobile phones, tablets and surf the web - were a way of bringing families together. He said: 'Worries that the digital revolution will destroy family life will prove unfounded. 'Online technologies are creating the 'networked family', where smartphone devices and the rise of event TV and shared internet experiences are enabling new forms of family connectedness.' The report also found that 67 per cent of Brits eat in front of the TV. Father-of-three Jeremy Simpson, 44, of High Wycombe, Buckinghamshire, said: 'Sundays used to be a time for everyone to get together and have a big roast dinner, but it has just become another day in the week rather than being anything special. 'We used to sit together as a family every Sunday, but as our children grew up it became harder and harder to get them to all sit around for one big family meal. 'It just so happens that during the week and on Saturdays we often all naturally end up at the dinner table at the same time - sadly, on Saturdays it's usually when Strictly or X Factor is on.'","Poll of 2,000 finds traditional sit-down roast dinner no longer as popular .

"A man who wears a sieve on his head for religious reasons has been allowed to wear his bizarre headgear on his official identity card. Prankster Lukas Novy, from Brno in the Czech Republic, claims that his Pastafarian faith means he has to wear the sieve at all times. Officials ruled that turning down Novy's request would be a breach of the country's religious equality laws. Unusual headgear: Lukas Novy exercising his right to wear a sieve on head for religious grounds in official ID for the Czech Republic . Brno City Hall spokesman Pavel Zara . explained: 'The application complies with the laws of the Czech Republic . where headgear for religious or medical reasons is permitted if it does . not hide the face.' Novy claims to be a member of the Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster, when emerged in the USA as spoof on organised religion. According to its tongue-in-cheek website their 'only dogma ... is the rejection of dogma'. Members claim to believe that an invisible alien made of spaghetti and meatballs created the universe after 'drinking heavily.' In 2005, physics graduate Bobby Henderson, 24, . from Oregon State wrote a letter about a 'Flying Spaghetti Monster' as a . protest against the Kansas State Board of Education's decision to allow . the teaching of intelligent fesign as an alternative to evolution in . public schools. The 'religion' arose as a response to . pressure for American schools to teach the theory known as intelligent . design, which some Christians favour as an alternative to natural . selection and evolution. The theory argues life must have been helped to . develop by an unseen power. The Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster wrote to the Kansas School . Board asking for the Pastafarian version of intelligent design to be . taught to schoolchildren as a way of criticising the intelligent design . campaigners. By . professing belief in a supernatural entity composed of pasta and . meatballs, Henderson called on 'Pastafarianism' to be given equal time . in science classrooms alongside Christian theory. Word . rapidly spread and the Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster (CFSM) now has thousands of followers, mainly on college campuses and in . Europe. The central tenet of CFSM is that an invisible Flying Spaghetti Monster created the universe 'after drinking heavily'. Pastafarians celebrate every Friday as a holy day - and consider pirates 'absolute divine beings'. Victory: Austrian businessman Niko Alm with his driver's licence, in which he wore a sieve . Fellow pastafarian Niko Alm won a . case in Austria when officials objected to the sieve on his head for his . driving licence photograph. It took Alm three years to get the license, after arguing that the sieve was a requirement of pastafarianism. Mr Alm, an entrepreneur, said he had the idea when he read that headgear was allowed in official pictures only for 'confessional' reasons. The atheist belongs to the Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster, a light-hearted 'faith' whose members call themselves Pastafarians because their 'only dogma... is the rejection of dogma'. Accordingly, Mr Alm sent his application for a new driver's licence in 2008 along with a picture of himself with a colander on his head. The stunt got him an invitation to the doctor's to check he was mentally fit to drive. However after three years, Alm's efforts finally paid off in 2011. Having received his driving licence, Niko Alm now wants to get pastafarianism officially recognised as an official faith in Austria.","'Pastafarian' man allowed to wear sieve in his identity photo .

"A hairdresser has had one of her fingers amputated after a bite from a false widow spider led to her catching a flesh-eating bug. Andrea Wallace was told she was just hours away from death after she was bitten on her left hand while playing outside with her children in Seaham, County Durham. The 44-year-old had assumed it was just an insect bite, but within hours it had doubled in size. Scroll down for video . Andrea Wallace had to have a finger amputated after catching a flesh-eating bug from a spider bite . Ms Wallace was told she was just hours away from death after she was bitten on her left hand while playing with her children in Seaham, County Durham.  Within hours the bite had doubled in size. She was left in agonising pain and soon the bite began to leak black pus, the Mirror reports. The mother-of-four rushed to Sunderland Hospital where she was kept for six weeks as doctors battled to remove the poison from her system. She said: 'You could see the poison tracking up the vein in my arm, the veins were changing colour, it was like something out of a horror film. 'The doctors told me it was a spider bite because they could see two fang marks. They said if I’d gone to hospital a couple of hours later the poison would have reached my heart and I’d be a goner.' She was later ­diagnosed with the flesh-eating disease necrotising fasciitis, which medics said had been caused by the insect bite. Ms Wallace underwent 14 operations on her finger but eventually it had to be amputated. Ms Wallace underwent 14 operations on her finger but eventually it had to be amputated. Ms Wallace shows off her post-amputation hand . Just a scar is left where Ms Wallace's finger used to be after doctors decided to amputate the putrid digit . Ms Wallace at home with her sons Kale, four, and Shay, ten . They've inspired terror into millions, sparking complaints that their danger has been over-hyped. So what are false widow spiders? Much of their reputation is thought to be thanks to the black widow, which although similarly named is far more dangerous and has been known to kill children, ill or elderly people. Although its bites can be intensely uncomfortable - swelling hugely when infected - the false widow (above) is not known to have caused any deaths in Britain. By comparison, around four Britons each year are though to die from bee or wasp stings when they have an allergic reaction. False widow spiders are distinctive with their shiny, black flesh, bulbous bodies, thick legs and skull-like patterns. Millions of false widows, Britain's most venomous spider, are found across the UK and the population is growing. Also known by its Latin name Steatoda Nobilis, its first British sighting was in Torquay, Devon, in 1879 and is thought to have remained largely in southern England. But the Natural History Museum says warmer summers mean the spider is spreading north, a theory backed by wildlife sightings.

As Britain's most venomous spider species, false widows made headlines last year when victims told how they had suffered huge wounds and almost lost limbs. An entire secondary school was shut in October last year in the Forest of Dean, Gloucestershire, after an outbreak of the arachnids in its ICT block had to be fumigated. In the worst cases, suspected bite victims have been treated in hospital or complained of ongoing health problems several months later. But many experts insist the spiders are not particularly dangerous and will only bite if approached or handled. There have been no reported deaths from the spiders in Britain, where they are believed to have arrived on crates of fruit from the Canary Islands in the 1870s. It is thought many of the worst reactions happen when bites become infected, rather than being linked to the spider's venom itself .","Andrea Wallace was just hours away from death after she was bitten .

"A patriotic parrot has learned to whistle a famous football anthem to cheer on the England team during the World Cup in Brazil. The African grey parrot named Slipmatt has spent a month learning a rendition of The Great Escape in preparation for the World Cup. The tune, the soundtrack to the famous war film, is a favourite of the England supporters band, who follow the team around the world. Scroll down for video . England fan Fran Sheridan taught his parrot Slipmatt to whistle The Great Escape, the song often played at England games, so his pet can support the national team during the World Cup in Brazil . Owner Fran Sheridan, from Worcester, also taught his pet to shout 'England' and cheer on his favourite player with shouts of 'Come on Rooney'. Mr Sheridan, 42, decided to teach the bird the tune after his football-mad six-year-old son, Reilly, suggested the bird learn a football song to chant along to the matches. Mr Sheridan said: 'Reilly is obsessed with the World Cup and asked if we could teach Slipmatt a football anthem. 'It's taken us about a month to get him to do it - and now he sings it all the time. 'He sat on his perch to watch the Three Lions' game against Italy on Saturday night and sang the anthem to the football - he sounds just like a rowdy football fan.' The nine-year-old exotic bird also makes noises like the football whistles used on the pitch. Slipmatt, an African Grey parrot, has also learned to shout 'England' and 'Come on Rooney' during games . After a week of his parrot's England chanting, Mr Sheridan says the trick is beginning to wear a little thin . Mr Sheridan says he plans to watch all of England's World Cup games with his talented pet. He added: 'He is a very clever parrot - when I bought him as a baby the breeder said he wouldn't start talking until her was eight or nine months old. 'Three months later he was already chattering away - it was just amazing.' But Mr Sheridan has admitted that since England's opening 2-1 loss to Italy, Slipmatt's repertoire has become a little tiring. He said: 'Now he sings it from the moment I take the cover off his cage in the morning until late at night. 'I can't get him to stop singing it - I have to admit it gets a bit annoying. It didn't really help when he was squawking The Great Escape all day after we lost.' Over 200 people have seen a clip of the parrot singing which Mr Sheridan has posted on You Tube. Slipmatt can also whistle Mr Bojangles and the themes to Superman, The A Team and Star Wars. Mr Sheridan chose the Great Escape tune due to it being a favourite of the England supporters band (above) and taught Slipmatt the Rooney chant due to the forward (below) being his favourite player .","Slipmatt the African grey parrot has learned England chants and songs .

"An Iowa man is lucky to be alive after jumping into the frigid waters of the Des Moines River on Monday and reportedly fighting off the help of rescuers attempting to save him. The incident occurred on the east side of the river near 6th Avenue across from North High School around 1.30 pm. Witnesses they say they saw the man - who has not been identified - jump into the iced-over river.

Freezing: Authorities say they got the call about the man around 1:30 p.m. and witnesses told officials they saw him jump into the water . When water rescue crews arrived they called out to the man, telling him to swim ashore. However they say he swam away from them and clung to a piece of ice. The crews were then forced to enter the water and get the man out. They used a special lightweight boat to move across the thin ice. The air temperature was 14 degrees and at one point a crew member fell through the ice trying to reach the man. 'Fortunately he didn't get under the ice. But as you saw the challenge of the thickness ... it wouldn't support our body's weight so that's why we brought that new rescue boat that we have that allows us to slide it across ice,' Brian O'Keefe from the Des Moines Fire Department told KCCI 8. Team work: A group of rescue workers help each other pull in the boat using a rope . Almost there: The Des Moines Fire Department lead the rescue on Monday . Within 15 minutes the man was safe at shore. He was transported to hospital. It is not known why he jumped in the water or displayed such bizarre behavior.

"Twenty years ago world leaders met for the first ever climate change summit but new figures show that since then the globe has become hotter and weather has become more weird. Numbers show that carbon dioxide emissions are up, the global temperature has increased, sea levels are rising along with the earth's population. The statistics come as more than 190 nations opened talks on Monday at a United Nations global warming conference in Lima, Peru. It is hoped the summit will pave the way for an international treaty on climate change, which would follow on from the first ever Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro in 1992, where leaders pledged to try and tackle climate change. Now data since 1983 has been analysed to show how the global climate is changing.

The first figures show that since 1992, there have been more than 6,600 major climate, weather and water disasters worldwide, causing more than $1.6 trillion in damage and killing more than 600,000 people, according to the Centre for Research on the Epidemiology of Disasters in Belgium, which tracks the world's catastrophes. While climate-related, not all can be blamed on man-made warming or climate change. But, extreme weather has noticeably increased over the years, says Debby Sapir, who runs the centre and its database. From 1983 to 1992 the world averaged 147 climate, water and weather disasters each year. Over the past 10 years, that number has jumped to an average 306 a year. In the United States, an index of climate extremes — hot and cold, wet and dry — kept by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has jumped 30 percent from 1992 to 2013, not counting hurricanes, based on 10-year averages. Worldwide, the 10-year average for weather-related losses adjusted for inflation was $30 billion a year from 1983-92, according to insurance giant Swiss Re. From 2004 to 2013, the cost was more than three times that on average, or $131 billion a year. Ms Sapir and others say it would be wrong to pin all, or even most, of these increases on climate change alone. But they note a trend of growing extremes and more disasters, and that fits with what scientists have long said about global warming. TEMPERATURE . Average global temperatures in 2000, which are considerably lower compared to 2013 . The average annual temperature for 2014 is on track to be 14.6 degrees Celsius, compared with 14.1 degrees Celsius in 1992 . In terms of temperature, 2014 is set to be the warmest in record, with the globe breaking six monthly heat records in 2014 and 47 since 1992. The last monthly cold record set was in 1916. The average annual temperature for 2014 is on track to be 14.6 degrees Celsius, compared with 14.1 degrees Celsius in 1992. OCEANS . Meanwhile, the world's oceans have risen by about three inches since 1992 and become more acidic, by about half a per cent,  thanks to chemical reactions caused by the absorption of carbon dioxide, scientists at NOAA and the University of Colorado say. The National Snow and Ice Data Centre also report that every year, sea ice cover shrinks to a yearly minimum size in the Arctic in September — a measurement that is considered a key climate change indicator. Data from NASA shows that sea levels have also continued to rise as a result of climate change . From 1983 to 1992, the lowest it got on average was 2.62 million square miles. Now the 10-year average is down to 1.83 million square miles . That loss, an average 790,000 square miles since 1992, overshadows the slight gain in sea ice in Antarctica, which has seen an average gain of 110,000 square miles of sea ice over the past 22 years. ON LAND . Within the same time frame, the world's population has also risden from 5.46 billion in 1992 to 7.18 billion today, meaning it is a third higher. This means more carbon pollution and more people who could be vulnerable to global warming. A map showing the extent of the Arctic ice cap in 1980 using data from the National Snow and Ice Data Centre . By 2012, large parts of the ice cap has melted while carbon dioxide pollution has steadily increased . And some of the biggest climate change effects on land are near the polar ice caps. From 1992 to 2011, Greenland's ice sheet lost 3.35 trillion tons of ice, according to calculations made by scientists using measurements from NASA's GRACE satellite while Antarctica lost 1.56 trillion tons of ice over the same period. THE AIR . A graph showing how carbon emissions have increased since the 1970s, with only Europe's emissions decreasing . At the same time, carbon dioxide pollution has increased steadily by 60 per cent from 1992 to 2013. In 1992, the world spewed 24.9 billion tons of carbon dioxide, now it is 39.8 billion, according to the Global Carbon Project, an international consortium. China has tripled its emissions from 3 billion tons to 11 billion tons a year but emissions from the U.S. have gone up more slowly, by about 6 percent, from 5.4 billion tons to 5.8 billion tons. India also has tripled its emissions, from 860 million tons to 2.6 billion tons with only European countries seeing their emissions go down, from 4.5 billion tons to 3.8 billion tons. Now scientists are warning that world leaders have caused global warming to spiral out of control despite knowing the climate was changing.

Andrew Dessler, a climate scientist at Texas A&M University said: 'Overall, what really strikes me is the missed opportunity. 'We knew by the early 1990s that global warming was coming, yet we have done essentially nothing to head off the risk. I think that future generations may be justifiably angry about this. While Michael Mann, a climate scientist at Penn State added: 'Greenhouse gases are rising steadily and the cause is fossil fuel burning and other human activities. The globe is warming, ice is melting and our climate is changing as a result.'","First climate change summit took place in 1992 in when leaders pledged to tackle climate change .

"They may like a little va va voom but French cars will no longer be powered by diesel if the country's prime minister gets his way. As part of a wider environmental effort to be launched next year, Manuel Valls said France was overly reliant on the fuel and pledged to wean the country off it. 'In France, we have long favored the diesel engine,' he said. 'This was a mistake, and we will progressively undo that, intelligently and pragmatically.' Around 80 percent of cars run on diesel in France, where the fuel is currently around 15 percent cheaper than petrol. Most European countries have similar policies because diesel cars are typically more efficient . French prime minister Manuel Valls said France's favoring of the diesel engine was 'a mistake' More than 30 million cars currently run on diesel in France today, according to the latest figures from the World Bank - approximately 80 percent of the total on the road. While French car ownership fell by almost 25 percent between 2007 and 2013, 86 percent of all French households still own a car. Unlike Britain where diesel prices are higher, the fuel is less expensive than petrol in France where the current tax system makes the fuel about 15 percent cheaper. Most European countries have similar policies because diesel cars are typically more efficient than their petrol counterparts. With the focus shifting from economy to air pollution, as of next year all French cars will be subject to a pollution rating which will facilitate the banning of the dirtiest cars from towns and cities. At present diesel costs around 1.25 euro, or 99p a liter, but as of next year the tax on diesel will also rise by around a penny, generating around £1.2 billion in revenue for the government. This will add around 50p to the price of a full tank for medium car owners and 70p for large car owners. However, drivers who trade their gas guzzlers for electric cars could get up to £8,600 in incentives for making the switch.","Around 80 percent of French cars currently run on diesel .

"It was meant to be a magical visit, creating special memories for some children who are unlikely to live to see next Christmas. But as dozens of children with cancer stood waiting in the cold, some risking their health to do so, it began to become clear a special Christmas visit was not going to happen. Children and their parents waited more than an hour for a visit by the Coca Cola bus at Ronald McDonald House at The Royal Manchester Children's Hospital, only to be told the bus was not coming and given no reason why. Many had been waiting at the roadside in wheelchairs and attached to drips, eager to catch a glimpse of the iconic truck. Others, suffering with cancer and other diseases, had risked their already fragile health by standing in the cold and families travelled from across the north west of England for the visit. Children with cancer were left waiting for more than an hour in the cold for a visit from the Coca Cola bus, which failed to turn up to Ronald McDonald House at The Royal Manchester Children's Hospital . Cheryl Capper and her partner Mike Cosgrove waited with their 16-year-old daughter Emma Capper who was diagnosed with incurable bone cancer in 2010. The family, from Cheadle, Stockport, found out that the cancer had spread to Emma's ribs and lungs last week, and said  they risked her health to wait in the cold to make happy memories fearing that this may be their last Christmas together. Miss Capper, mother to Emma, said: 'It's potentially Emma's last Christmas and every little treat is huge. We were looking forward to getting our photo together with the truck. There were children there in wheelchairs with drips wrapped in blankets, it was heartbreaking. 'My daughter has got lung tumours, the cold air is a deterioration to her health - but we were making another memory.' Miss Capper said as they waited more than an hour with other families, excited to see the truck, they began to wonder if it would actually turn up. 'I kept thinking it's late, it won't let these children down, it can't let these children down,' she added. 'I was just as excited as them.' Samantha Irvine, waited with her 11-year-old daughter Amber Irvine. Amber recently beat leukaemia after being 24 hours to live. Robert Irvine (left) and Samantha Irvine (right) waited with their daughter Amber for the Coca Cola truck . Staff at Ronald McDonald House were forced to tell children and their families the truck was not turning up . The mother-of-four, from Ashton-under-Lyne, said: 'All the children were shivering. There were children there on drips and we kept having to get them extra blankets. 'My children cried all the way home. 'Some of the children there may never get the chance to see it again, that's the part that broke my heart.' Ronald McDonald House provides free accommodation for the families of children who are being treated at Manchester Children's Hospital and St Mary's Neonatal unit. Staff at Ronald McDonald House were forced to announce that the visit from the truck had been cancelled when it failed to show up on Sunday. Coca Cola said a 'miscommunication' meant the driver had not been told the correct time to turn up at the hospital and apologised for the mistake. A spokeswoman said: 'This was an oversight on our behalf and we're saddened to hear that many families were left disappointed. We want to try to make it up to everyone and bring happiness and Christmas cheer to the Ronald McDonald House, so we are in touch with the charity to arrange another special stop within the next week. 'We will confirm the date and time as soon as possible. We apologise again for any inconvenience caused, but hope as many people as possible will be able to join us for a festive experience.'","Children diagnosed with cancer waited for Christmas Coca Cola truck .

"Roman Abramovich and his partner Darya Zhukova will supposedly stay in the hotel next week . Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich has booked all 111-rooms in the Beresheet Hotel in the Israeli desert resort of Mitzpe Ramon for next week's Jewish Passover holiday, a source close to the hotel told the Daily Mail. Mr. Abramovich, who is Jewish, will reportedly fly to Ben Gurion airport near Tel Aviv in his private jet on Sunday with his partner Darya Zhukova and their children Aaron and Leah, and travel by limousine to the hotel. It is believed he will host family and friends at the hotel between Sunday and Thursday - at an estimated cost of $450,000 - and that the highlight of the vacation will be a Passover banquet in a tent specially constructed in the desert. During the Passover banquet Jews traditionally recount the story of the Exodus from Egypt and the source claimed Mr. Abramovich wants to be close to where the biblical action actually took place. Beresheet Hotel has a stunning view of the 500 metre-deep Ramon Crater, the world's largest crater created by erosion. Mr. Abramovich is going one better than the last time he spent Passover in Israel, in 2009, when he only he only rented an entire floor of 36 rooms in the Royal Beach Hotel in the Red Sea resort of Eilat. The Beresheet Hotel is one of Israel's top resorts and has supposedly been fully booked by the oligarch . Mr. Abramovich is a frequent visitor to Israel. In the past year alone he has been to the country five times, including visits to technology incubators in Tel Aviv with a view to investing in high-tech startups and attending a fundraising event for an organization that carries out archeological excavations, which he supports financially. Ms. Zhukova is a billionaire in her own right. A fashion designer and businesswoman, she was born in Russia but raised in California by her Jewish mother after her parents divorced.","Roman Abramovich will reportedly host family and friends at the hotel between Sunday and Thursday next week for the Jewish holiday .

"The Republican-led House may have settled on a strategy to attack President Barack Obama's immigration 'amnesty' plan without shutting down the government, while giving tea party conservatives a way to vent their anger. It's the 'CRomnibus' – not to be confused with the 'cronut.' The plan calls for a symbolic vote to de-fund Obama's executive actions on immigration, along with a hybrid budget plan that puts the White House's immigration authorities on a short leash. House Speaker John Boehner told lawmakers Tuesday to expect a straight de-funding vote this week. The Senate, still under Democratic control, would ignore the measure and the president would veto it in any event. That would tee up a budget battle that's more about Republican infighting than the usual GOP-versus-Democrats squabbles. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEOS . House Speaker John Boehner told reporters on Tuesday about his attempt to strike a balance between conservatives determined to stop President Obama's immigration order and other lawmakers just as determined to avoid another politically damaging government shutdown . Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson testified Tuesday on Capitol Hill, insisting that lawmakers shouldn't hold his budget hostage to a D.C. war over immigration policy . The most recent 'Continuing Resolution' (CR) funding the federal government expires on Dec. 11, just as the outgoing Congress packs its things. House conservatives want to let it expire, or extend it for only a short time. Moderates, including Boehner and other party leaders, want an 'omnibus' budget passed instead, funding the government through the end of next September when Uncle Sam's fiscal year ends. They fear a showdown with Obama would bring another partial government 'shutdown' that the White House would successfully pin on them. Right-wingers, meanwhile, see that position as a white flag of surrender to Obama's immigration plan. So, faced with a tea party caucus large enough to block an omnibus budget, Boehner is considering a plan that would give the party's right wing something to crow about while keeping the White House from going on the attack over a shutdown threat. Enter the CRomnibus. The latest solution to GOP infighting is a hybrid bill that would fund most of the government through September 2015 – all except for immigration authorities, which would get a three-month 'CR.' That strategy would let Republicans gin up another battle in early 2015 when they control both houses of Congress. 'The cavalry is coming,' Ohio Republican Rep. Jim Jordan promised on Tuesday during a monthly 'Conversations with Conservatives' meeting in Washington. He argued that anything passed in the house should tie Obama's hands until January. 'And then if Harry Reid and the Senate don’t pass that ... then let’s do something very short term,' Jordan said. 'Let's wait for the majority in the Senate to change.' Arizona Republican Rep. Matt Salmon told Roll Call that he believed, 'as many of the members do,' that Obama's immigration plan is unconstitutional. 'So you just want me to fund the unconstitutional act for 60 days?' Salmon asked. 'Isn't that kind of like being a little bit pregnant? No, that doesn’t work for me.' Democratic Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, who will lose his leadership perch in January, signaled his support for the idea, calling it 'a big accomplishment if we could get a bill over here that would fund all the appropriations subcommittees except for one.' 'I think it's kind of unfortunate that they're talking about not doing Homeland Security but that’s the way it is,' he told reporters on Capitol Hill. The White House also expressed disappointment with the option currently being considered by Congress on Wednesday but restrained itself from issuing a veto threat. Repeating previous assertions that the White House would like Congress to pass a budget that funds all areas of the government through the end of the fiscal year, the president's spokesman said today that Republicans should refrain from adding 'unnecessary ideological riders' to the current budget legislation. 'There will be ample opportunity for Republicans, next year, when they have control of both the House and the Senate to pursue any number of ideological ideas that they may want to codify into legislation,' White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said. 'There's no reason they should attach them to a budget proposal,' he added. Republican Majority Leader-elect Mitch McConnell will meet with Obama at the White House on Wednesday to discuss the budget plan, among other issues, but the White House was unwilling to provide reporters insight on that meeting during Wednesday's briefing. CATBIRD SEAT: Obama is wagering that Republicans won't risk losing their Election Day luster by threatening to shut down the government in order to stop his executive 'amnesty' order . While Democrats seemed willing to accept the current plan, Senate conservatives are itching for a fight. 'The Chairman of the Republican Party made a promise to America on executive amnesty: ‘We can’t allow it to happen and we won’t let it happen… everything we can do to stop it we will,’ Alabama Republican Sen. Jeff Sessions recalled Tuesday. 'Unfortunately, the plan now being circulated in the House fails to meet that test.' Sessions objects to the 'CR' part of the 'CRomnibus' proposal, arguing that U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Enforcement should be left twisting in the wind entirely. 'Congress must respond to the president’s unlawful [immigration] action by funding the government but not funding illegal amnesty,' he said. 'This is a perfectly sound and routine application of congressional authority.' In the House, Boehner faces a tough challenge: how to give outraged tea party conservatives a toothless outlet to vent over Obama's unilateral move to mainstream millions of illegal immigrants without permission from federal lawmakers. A symbolic vote to de-fund USCIS's planned ramp-up of green cards and work permits would be one solution. 'We're looking at a number of options in terms of how to address this. This is a serious breach of our Constitution,' Boehner told reporters on Tuesday. 'It's a serious threat to our system of government, and frankly we have limited options and limited ability to deal with it directly.' Johnson could find himself on a short leash for a few months if the 'CRomnibus' plan goes into effect . Publicly, the speaker said no decision had been made. But aides and lawmakers said he indicated during a closed-door meeting with the rank and file that a vote on legislation to block Obama was the leading option. It would be on a bill by Florida Republican Rep. Ted Yoho, aimed at blocking Obama from unilaterally allowing categories of unlawful immigrants to live and work here. Party leaders then hope to move on next week to voting on must-pass spending legislation to keep the government running. In the wake of their midterm election victories last month to win full control of Congress, Republican leaders are eager to show they can govern responsibly. But Obama's administrative moves on immigration and the resulting GOP fury has created complications. Some outside conservatives were quick to register opposition, arguing that the approach would do nothing to stop Obama's plans stripping away the money to carry out the policy. 'If conservative members agree to this plan, they are just as complicit in Obama's amnesty as everyone else.  Don't be fooled, once this budget bill passes the amnesty will be irrevocable,' wrote Daniel Horowitz, a columnist for the Conservative Review. Meanwhile Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson defended Obama's new immigration plans before a House committee where Republicans took turns denouncing them as an unconstitutional power grab that would incite a new rush of illegal immigration at the border. 'The president's unilateral actions to bypass Congress undermine the Constitution and threaten our democracy,' said Texas Republican Rep. Michael McCaul, the chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee. 'We will see a wave of illegal immigration because of the president's actions.' Johnson disputed that point and others, arguing the president acted within his executive authority to temporarily defer deportations for certain immigrants who are not priorities for removal anyway. The actions apply mostly to people who've been in the country five years or more and have kids who are citizens or green card holders. 'I'm fully comfortable that we have the legal authority to push forward these reforms,' Johnson said. 'Deferred action is an inherent executive branch authority that can and should be used from time to time, and we've done so here.' The spending measure the House will vote on next week will top $1 trillion and fund the day-to-day operations of cabinet agencies through the Sept. 30 end of the 2015 fiscal year. Johnson spoke out strongly against putting his Homeland Security Department on a short-term budget, saying it could prevent him from funding needed priorities including hiring protection for presidential candidates heading into the 2016 elections.","Conservative Republicans want to de-fund parts of the government that would implement Obama's orders legalizing millions of illegal immigrants .

"On the new political drama State of Affairs, Katherine Heigl plays a CIA analyst dealt the heavy responsibility of keeping the president informed on the biggest national security issues of the day, which she compiles in a folder called the President's Daily Brief. But the CIA says paper briefs are SO last administration. The spy agency has been live-tweeting State of Affairs every Monday night, using the show's plot to dispel rumors and educate viewers on the history of the 'PDB' and how it comes together today. In several scenes on the show, Heigl's character Charleston Tucker is seen talking the president, played by Alfre Woodard, through the daily brief printed out on sheets of paper in a leather folder. The CIA says the PDB hasn't been printed out for years. Instead, President Barack Obama and other key policy makers view their daily brief in tablet form. Scroll down for video .

Instead, he and other key national security policy makers view the document on a tablet, the CIA revealed . In another episode, Heigl is seen meeting in person with other CIA agents, which the agency says is actually dangerous since enemies can target both parties in one place. One way agents get around meeting face to face is by staging 'dead drops' in which they hide information to be picked up by the other party. The CIA then tweeted a picture from their museum, showing an old dead drop spike, a hollow device that was pushed into the ground for concealment. A CIA spokesman told TMZ that State of Affairs is helping 'counter popular myths and misconceptions about the agency', and that social media is the perfect way to give Americans more information as the show plays in real time.

However, most of what is seen on the show is likely in line with how the CIA really works, since two ex-agents are producers and Heigl revealed  that the show is also working with the agency. 'We are delving into stuff in a way no one else can do because we are actually working with CIA guys who are telling us stuff,' Heigl said in a preview for the show. Former CIA counterterrorism head Henry Crumpton and Rodney Faraon, who was a member of the daily briefing team in the Clinton and second Bush Administrations, are both producers, bringing their years of working in the CIA to the show. 'Everything I've seen so far has been authentic,' Faraon said in a preview. Living history: The President's Daily Brief has been prepared for the commander-in-chief for the last 60 years.

"A social housing resident has been booted out of his home over his litter-strewn and overgrown back garden. Kevin Kime's backyard had bags full of 'rotting smelly rubbish' and was covered in pieces of plastic sheeting and broken fencing. His lawn was also overrun with brambles while a broken basketball hoop had been propped up against the against a fence and an old table and chairs were almost hidden underneath the pile of black bags. The 47-year-old had been warned two years ago to clean up his overgrown plot but social housing bosses lost patience after making a surprise inspection. Kevin Kime has been kicked out of his home for having this overgrown and untidy garden . Nottingham City Homes (NCH), which runs council housing in the city, booted Kime out of his semi-detached house in Romilay Close, Beeston, two weeks ago. The eviction was the first in the city for over seven years and the social housing group had to get in professional cleaners to clear the garden and wash the interior. NCH had successfully applied to Nottingham County Court for an Outright Possession Order against Kime, claiming he had persistently breached his tenancy agreement which states residents must 'make sure their gardens are maintained, tidy and free of rubbish'. Gill Moy, director of housing at NCH, said: 'Our tenancy agreement is very clear that the customers are responsible for maintaining their gardens. 'Mr Kime's failure to act left the judge with no option but to conclude that it was unlikely there would be any improvement in the condition of the garden, so he granted us an outright possession order to evict Mr Kime from his home.' Residents on the well-maintained Lenton Abbey estate yesterday expressed their relief Kime had been given his marching orders. The 47 year-old was warned two years ago to clean up his act but when inspectors from Nottingham City Homes conducted a surprise visit, they found the garden in a state . Neighbour Jeremy Phillips, 43, said: 'It was horrible to live next to. 'At first glance it was just brambles but if you looked closer you could see that there was furniture buried under bags of rotting, smelly rubbish. 'I can't imagine how they lived in there. If the outside looked like that and they were dumping rubbish out I wonder how jammed full the inside must have been.' Emma Turner, 23, who lives three doors down from the property, added: 'You didn't really see him much, I can't imagine they would have shown their face often to us knowing the state of that garden. 'It was an eyesore, I just hope someone will be brought in who looks after it better. 'Maybe they need some help now, if they had a warning two years ago and still couldn't help themselves you wonder if there's a bigger issue.' Michael Edwards, 22, who rents a bedroom in a nearby house, said: 'That can't have been nice to live next to. 'I know for most people looking after a garden isn't a top priority, but that's just ridiculous.' And shop worker David Winchester, 27, added: 'That does look out of order, but I don't know if kicking someone out of their home for that is a bit extreme.' Neighbours have expressed their relief at Kime's eviction who had let his garden become overgrown and litter strewn . The garden has now been restored after a team of cleaners cleared the rubbish and cut back the overgrown brambles and hedges. Local councillor Sam Webster said: 'Gardens that are left completely neglected have an impact on other residents and bring down the area. From time to time we get feedback from residents in Lenton Abbey and they ask for more robust action in serious cases.' One neighbour on Romilay Court said: 'I noticed it didn't look great when I cut part of the hedge down but it didn't smell or anything like that.' And another resident added: 'You didn't notice the problem because of the high hedges but these pictures do look pretty bad.' NCH had served Mr Kime an injunction in December 2012 compelling him to clean up the garden but when he failed to do so the county court issued an Outright Possession Order. A spokesman said: 'Despite assurances to NCH officers that he would make improvements by required deadlines, he did not stick to these timescales or made little or no improvement to his garden. 'The agreement all tenants sign up to states that they agree to be responsible for making sure their gardens, yards and hedges are maintained, tidy and free of rubbish at all times. 'This includes grass, plants, bushes, hedges and trees.'","Kevin Kime, 47, was warned two years ago to clean up his untidy plot .

"One of the 14 bullets fired by a Milwaukee police officer at a mentally ill man killed in a downtown park in April hit him in the back, according to official autopsy results released Monday by an attorney for the man's family. Jon Safran, the attorney for Dontre Hamilton's family, said he wants the public to have 'more accurate information' as a prosecutor weighs whether to file charges against Officer Christopher Manney. Hamilton was on the ground when Manney responded to a call for a welfare check and began a pat-down. Manney, who is white, said he fatally shot Hamilton, who was black, after a fight and that he feared Hamilton would kill him. What motivated the killing? Jon Safran, the attorney for Dontre Hamilton's (Hamilton at left) family, has called into question the mentally ill 31-year-old killer's description of events as a prosecutor weighs whether to file charges against Officer Christopher Manney (right) The autopsy, conducted by the Milwaukee County medical examiner's office, found that half of the 14 shots that hit Hamilton traveled downward, with one hitting his back. Safran said that seems to indicate the officer was standing above Hamilton. No gunpowder residue was found near Hamilton's wounds, which Safran said showed the men were not close when Manney fired. Milwaukee police referred comment to the medical examiner's office, which declined comment. The district attorney also declined comment. The district attorney had been waiting for reports from outside experts to make a decision on charges. Fred Anapol, professor of anthropology at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, looked at the autopsy documents Monday and said the possibilities for the downward trajectory include the officer being taller or the gun otherwise being pointed down. But he said it's hard to make conclusions without all the police reports. Looking for justice: In this October 13 photo, Maria Hamilton holds posters used in rallies calling the release of information and policy changes after her son, Dontre Hamilton, was shot and killed by a police officer in Milwaukee. Hamilton's family says he had schizophrenia and described Hamilton as fearful, but not dangerous or violent . 'You can't really tell anything just based on the autopsy,' he said. 'You can't tell intent, you can't tell the circumstances.' The autopsy also found abrasions on Hamilton's chin, scalp, neck and arm. Safran said he's seen photos of Manney right after the altercation, in which Manney said they struggled, that don't seem to show any wounds on the officer, Safran said. 'We just want to try to correct some of the misinformation out there, at least raise some concerns to be fair that the public and news media should be asking for more information from the department for them to justify how it can be described as this violent act by Dontre Hamilton against Christopher Manney,' Safran said. The autopsy also revealed Hamilton had no drugs system. Chief Edward Flynn fired Manney in October, saying he improperly treated Hamilton as a criminal. Flynn has said Hamilton resisted the pat-down and that the two exchanged punches and strikes before Hamilton hit Manney on the neck with Manney's baton. Manney then shot Hamilton. Hamilton's family says he had schizophrenia and described Hamilton as fearful, but not dangerous or violent. In this October 11 photo, family, friends and community members of Dontre Hamilton rally in Red Arrow Park in downtown Milwaukee where Officer Christopher Manney shot and killed Hamilton on April 30. Family and friends say they will continue to hold rallies and protests in an effort to convince Milwaukee County District Attorney John Chisholm to bring criminal charges against Manney in Hamilton's death .","Milwaukee police Officer Christopher Manney fired at Dontre Hamilton in April, killing him .

"Born three and a half months premature, baby Ward Miles did not have the easiest start in life but thanks to the love of his parents and endless dedication of doctors and nurses, the . little fighter pulled through. His father, Benjamin Miller who is a photographer that works under the name Benjamin . Scot, captured his son's first year in a moving short film, beginning with those difficult, early days in the NICU and following Ward as he goes from strength to strength at home. The video begins with new mom Lyndsey gingerly picking up her son, who weighs under 1.5lbs, four days after he was born 15 weeks early at Nationwide Children's Hospital in Columbus, Ohio. Mother Lyndsey holds her son for the first time, four days after he was born three and a half months premature . The proud mother holds her little son who weighs just under 1.5lb at this stage . The new mother is overwhelmed by the moment as she holds her tiny son in the NICU . Little Ward Miles spent the first 107 days of his life in the NICU with a host of machines to help him survive . With the help of the nurses moving wires and medical equipment, Lyndsey eases into a chair and holds her tiny son to her chest. She smiles for the camera and then the new mother becomes overwhelmed by the moment and bursts into tears. The moving scene is just one of many in the couple's emotional roller coaster following the birth of  their premature son on July 16, 2012. It has been captured beautifully in the seven-minute Vimeo film which Mr Miller dedicated to his wife and to the doctors and nurses who were constantly by their side. Mr and Mrs Miller, both from central Ohio, have been married for four years and live in Columbus. Mrs Miller watches her son inside the incubator at Nationwide Children's Hospital in Columbus, Ohio .

Their first child Ward was born 15 weeks early at Riverside Methodist Hospital, weighing . just 1lb 13oz. He was transferred four days after he was born to . Nationwide Children's Hospital to undergo a procedure and remained in the hospital's NICU fighting for his life for the next 107 days. 'There were two very scary moments that stand out among the rest,' Mr Miller said. 'The . first was when they did his first brain scan looking for bleeding. There are 4 grades, 1-4 with 4 being the worst. The results came back and he had a grade 2 . on one side, and a grade 4 on the other. 'Lyndsey . called me at work ( I had just gone back) and the second I picked up, I . knew something was wrong. She told me what they found out and I . immediately left to be with them.

The new mom cuddles her tiny son during his early days in the NICU hooked up to life-saving equipment . Benjamin Miller and wife Lindsey with baby Ward Miles in the ICU at Nationwide Children's Hospital in Columbus, Ohio . He continued: 'I cried and prayed the whole way down. The bleeds could lead to severe problems down the road. He may not be . able to walk. He may have cerebral palsy. He may be mentally . handicapped. The list goes on and on. 'When I got there we just embraced . and cried together. He looked exactly the same. He had no idea that some . test was done. He was still Ward. 'I felt so bad for him. It wasn't his . fault. He couldn't do anything to fix it. We couldn't do anything to fix . it. The doctors couldn't do anything to fix it. It was a horrible . feeling. All we could do was pray.' Mr Miller shared with MailOnline the thoughts that he put down in his journal, when during one of the new parents' darkest hours, their son offered them a glimmer of hope. He wrote: 'At . the 6 oclock care time, we were holding his hand, looking at him, . talking to him. His CPAP mask was off, and his feeding tube was out as . well. Baby Ward smiles as his mother holds him close as he goes from strength to strength . The baby boy is wrapped tightly in a swaddle after having most of his medical equipment removed . Ward lets out a healthy cry as he sits up in his baby seat after being taken home . Ward giggles on his play mat clearly showing that vast improvements in his weight and health . 'While we . were watching him, he turned his little head towards us, and then opened . his eyes. We know he can't see at this stage, but the fact that he . opened them, and opened them so wide we had not seen before. He stared . right at us. He held our gaze. Just looked right at us. Didn't blink. I . had enough time to get a photo of it. After a little while he shut his . little eyes and turned his head back to the ceiling. I will never forget . that moment. I feel as if he was telling us 'I'm okay!!! Don't give up . on me!' The new father noted a few lines later: 'We won't.' In the next few days, the parents were given the reassuring news that the bleeding had stopped. Mr Miller's video soon changes from images of the NICU to capture his young son's developing personality (including some hilarious facial expressions) Lyndsey brings baby Ward in for kiss as he grows stronger with every month . Ward goes from feeding via a tube to taking his own bottle in his crib at home in Columbus, Ohio . Thankfully, the video soon takes a turn and there are fewer tubes and beeping monitors.

The dogs had no idea what to think. 107 days is . almost 1/3rd of a year. 'Being able to come home from work and not have . to drive down to the hospital to see our son was such a huge blessing. We certainly will never take that for granted.' Although the little boy still has some feeding issues, Mr Miller said that doctors are in disbelief when they find out his healthy son was born 15 weeks premature.

"Victim Sandra Nowocinska,22, died in hospital four days after being rescued from the suspected arson attack . A 22-year-old mother has died in hospital four days after she was rescued from a suspected arson attack on a block of flats. Sandra Nowocinska, whose death is being treated as manslaughter, was injured along with her five-year-old son in a suspicious fire in Kidderminster, Worcestershire. A spokesman for West Mercia Police said Ms Nowocinska died yesterday afternoon with her family at her side. Her son, who has not been named by police, remains in a serious but stable condition at Birmingham Children's Hospital. Firefighters rescued the mother and son from an apartment above a shop in Horsefair, Kidderminster, after being alerted at 9.55pm last Thursday. Two other people were treated for the effects of smoke inhalation. Eyewitnesses described a bang followed by a 'big cloud of smoke' as several people jumped from flats above the Dress 4 Less shop. Dramatic video phone footage captured the moment a Domino's pizza lorry pulled up to the property to allow a man to escape by jumping on top of the HGV. Terry Thomas, 63, said: 'Someone had the presence of mind to stop a pizza truck by walking out into the road. 'It pulled up towards the window as close as it could get and two lads jumped out on to the top of that from the window.' Paying tribute to Ms Nowocinska, childhood friend Ewelina Wojtera, 23, from Perry Barr, Birmingham, said: 'We grew up together in Poland. I've probably known her about nine or ten years. 'She was a very happy person, always smiling. There was no one who met her who didn't like her. She was an absolutely brilliant mum too. 'Sandra was always there for everyone, including me. 'When I heard she was in hospital in a critical condition we were all hoping she was going to make it. I can't believe she has gone. Everyone is just in shock. 'Her family want to take her body back to Poland but they're worried about the cost.' Scroll down for video . This is the dramatic moment that a man trapped inside the burning block jumped to safety from a window . The man landed on a pizza delivery lorry that had been positioned under the window to enable him to escape safely . Ms Nowocinska was originally from the town of Grudziadz in northern Poland, where both her parents still live. She moved to England a year ago but had only lived in the Kidderminster flat that caught fire for a few months. Detective Inspector Leighton Harding said: 'A dedicated team of detectives and staff continue to investigate the circumstances around the fire, which is being treated as suspicious. 'We are treating Sandra's death as manslaughter and we would appeal for anyone with any information that may help the investigation to contact us.' A 41-year-old local man arrested last week on suspicion of arson with intent to endanger life has been released on bail.

"Girls and young women have to put up with sexual harassment as a normal part of their lives, Girl Guide leaders said yesterday. They said that girls as young as seven experience routine sexual taunting from boys and nearly six out of 10 teenagers have faced some form of harassment. The claims were based on the Guides’ annual Girls’ Attitudes Survey, a poll of opinions of girls aged between seven and 21 carried out to reflect the organisation’s growing interest in feminism and equality. Seven out of 10 girls aged between 13 and 16 said that those who reported incidents of sexual harassment risked being bullied or teased. Stock picture used . Half of the girls aged between 11 and 16 who took part said that teachers and staff at their schools dismiss harassment as banter or tell them to ignore incidents. Seven out of 10 of girls aged between 13 and 16 said that those who report incidents risk being bullied or teased. The findings were made public by Girlguiding Scotland which called for a response from politicians. Chief Denise King said: ‘This shocking research shows we must act to stop sexual harassment being normalised by our society. ‘We want to ensure all girls live in a safe, fair and equal society that lets them reach their full potential. We’re calling on all politicians to take a stand.’ Labour leader Ed Miliband (pictured) has pledged his support for the movement's Girls Matter equality campaign . The call follows the launch by Girlguiding in England of a feminist election manifesto which demands compulsory school lessons in ‘body confidence’ and equal numbers of men and women in Parliament. The historic youth movement for girls said it was making its intervention into politics because ‘young women still believe they are too often treated like second-class citizens.’ Claiming that three quarters of teenage girls believe sexism affects most areas of their lives, the Guides said that there is ‘overwhelming evidence of inequality for girls in the UK.’ Labour leader Ed Miliband has pledged his support for the movement’s Girls Matter equality campaign. The survey results made public yesterday showed that one in five girls from seven to 12 say they have been subjected to girls of a sexual nature from boys. Overall, it said, one in five girls aged 13 to 21 had experienced unwanted sexual attention or unwanted touching. Guide Amy Callaghan, 16, part of the panel that developed and analysed the research, said: ‘Every day, many girls’ lives are made a misery by sexist comments, sexual harassment and abuse at school. ‘What’s worse is that it’s not being treated as a serious issue. We need politicians to take action and sign up to our Girls Matter pledges. We need them to send a message that this kind of behaviour towards girls and young women will not be tolerated.’","Girl Guide leaders claim girls are forced to put up with sexual harassment .

"A young Ferguson activist who met with President Barack Obama at the White House this week is blasting the prospect of a presidential visit to the St. Louis, Missouri, suburb as 'too little, too late' and 'bulls*** symbolism.' On a conference call with reporters last night Millennial Activists United co-founder Ashley Yates said she and the other young, civil rights activists who met with Obama on Monday did not request that he visit Ferguson because they were focused on getting him to take more substantive actions. Her comments set of a firestorm on Twitter, in which she participated, sending out a string of tweets ridiculing the media and anyone else she perceived as suggesting a photo op with the president would solve Ferguson's race relations problems. Scroll down for video . President Barack Obama met with young Ferguson activists on Monday to discuss issues important to them., including Millennial Activists United co-founder Ashley Yates, pictured here. Yates said yesterday that she and other young civil rights leaders who met with the president did not ask him to visit the Missouri town, calling it 'too little, too late' Yates, a 29-year-old St. Louis resident, helped found Millennial Activists United after the death of 18-year-old Ferguson resident Michael Brown. Brown, who is black, was shot and killed by local police officer Darren Wilson, who is white. After being acquitted last week of criminal charges by a grand jury, Wilson resigned his position. He still faces the possibility of being charged by federal prosecutors for alleged civil rights violations. The grand jury's decision to let Wilson walk sparked protests anew in Ferguson and led to renewed focus in the White House on the division between law enforcement officers in communities of color and the public. On Monday the White House announced that a task force would review a Pentagon program that provides excess equipment to police departments amid concerns over the militarization of law enforcement. It also disclosed a $263 million adjustment to its 2015 budget request to fund up to 50,000 body cameras for police officers. Obama also held Ferguson-related meetings throughout the day at the White House with members of his cabinet, civil rights leaders of all ages, elected officials, academics, faith leaders and law enforcement officers. However, the president's spokesman said that afternoon that Obama had no plans of traveling to the Missouri town to try to soothe racial tensions while vaguely acknowledging that the president could change his mind and make the trip after all. The White House flack wouldn't say why Obama won't visit Ferguson now or what it would take for him to make the journey. The side-step didn't seem to bother the president's guests, as the young civil rights leaders revealed on Tuesday that they didn't press the president on the issue. Calling an Obama visit 'too little, too late,' Yates told reporters, 'What we need him to do now is him use the power of his position, the power of the highest office of the land to enact some real change. 'We have been on the ground making the changes that we can in our community, but these are high-level changes that we need to see,' she said, according to the Associated Press. 'These are systemic issues and we need systemic solutions for them. We need policies. We need the backing of our black president to say that this is a racial issue and that he stands behind us. 'We don't need him to come and put boots to the ground. He should have done that 100 days ago.' In this picture posted to Yates' twitter, she stands outside the White House on Monday with other young activists, waiting to be let in for their meeting with Obama. Yates said Tuesday that she didn't press him to come to Ferguson because 'we don't need him to come and put boots to the ground. He should have done that 100 days ago' Yates' comments set off a firestorm on Twitter. She fueled the fire by sending out a series of tweets explaining her reasoning . After her remarks elicited negative reactions from some of her peers, Yates defended herself on twitter and slammed her detractors for buying into the narrative that an Obama visit is all-important. 'The media continues to push this bulls*** vision of Obama coming to Ferguson and rebuilding it with his bare hands & you fell for it,' she told her followers. 'So folks want to get mad at me for rejecting that bulls*** ""fairytale"". Let me say it again: there's nothing cute about this police state,' she added. 'So while you all are focused on THAT, you are missing out on the real. They WANT our ask to be some bulls*** symbolism,' she said in another tweet. Continuing, a flabbergasted Yates pointed out that Obama is perhaps the most powerful man in the world 'and the demand you want met is for him to come shake hands?! For WHAT?' 'We don't need him to come to the terror zone as so many of you have. & he doesn't need to come. He is WELL aware of what we've experienced,' she said. 'An Obama visit to Ferguson is small potatoes. I'm trying to feed my folks STEAK. Never settle. Stop jumping after every bone.' Yates said on Twitter that given that Obama is arguably the most powerful man in the world, she's shocked that 'the demand you want met is for him to come shake hands?! For WHAT?' In an appearance on progressive news program Democracy Now! on Tuesday Yates revealed that in her meeting with the president she made a personal appeal for federal action in the name of her young cousin. 'I looked the president right in his eye, and said that I do this work because I want to make sure that unlike Tamir Rice, and unlike Trayvon Martin and unlike Mike Brown, my little cousin can make it home safely,' she said. Describing the meeting with Obama as a 'frank conversation,' she said the president was 'very receptive and was open and willing to hear our experiences and really get that viewpoint from the other side.' According to advocacy website Ferguson Action, Yates and other young leaders in the meeting, which included three other Missouri natives as well as three advocates from other states, demanded federal prosecution of police officers who 'kill or abuse people.' They also requested independent prosecution of police officers who commit violent acts, taking the burden off of local district attorneys with whom they may be acquainted, and the creation of community review boards that have the power to make recommendations for action against police misconduct. Also on their list was the defunding of police departments that 'use excessive force or racially profile, the demilitarization of police and new investments in alternatives to incarceration. 'There is no reason that our local law enforcement should have military weapons, and especially in the way in which they've been using them,' Yates told Democracy Now! on Tuesday while advocating for the federal program to be abolished. 'They were given those weapons in order to fight terrorism, but they are the ones enacting terrorism upon our communities,' she said, and using military weapons to 'oppress American citizens.' The White House said on Monday that while it believed the program needed better oversight, a recent review, conducted in the wake of the Ferguson protests, found that it had many benefits, as well. Furthermore, a 'majority' of the purchases made through the program by local police were not for military-grade weapons, they were for office supplies, White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said. While at the White House Yates instead advocated that the federal government abolish a Pentagon program that gives excess military equipment to police . Yates, right, also posted this selfie of the vice president and the young activists in the meeting to her Twitter account . Yates also threw cold water on Tuesday on the White House's funding request for body cameras for cops. 'Cameras didn't save Tamir Rice. Cameras didn't save John Crawford. They didn't make sure that John Crawford saw justice,' she argued. The root cause of the division in Ferguson and elsewhere, she said, 'is racism in America, the anti-black sentiment.' Brown's shooter, Wilson, should not have been allowed to resign, she said, he should have been fired. Instead, he's now a 'much richer man' than he was before because of campaigns started by supporters to pay his legal bills. 'It is profitable to kill a black boy.

'Meeting the POTUS is only an affirmation to me that WE are on the right path. This movement is shifting the nation, we elicited a response,' she wrote. Still the fact that a few activists 'got to walk into a room called the Oval Office today after 115 days of active resistance. That's not enough,' she opined. 'Think about how ALL of us can walk into freedom by keeping it up. This movement is JUST beginning. This America doesn't work. SHUT IT DOWN,' she added, repeating a catch phrase of Ferguson protesters related to their Black Friday boycotts. 'Without SHUTTING IT DOWN, we would have never been able to walk in that building today. A building my ancestors built,' Yates stated.","'We don't need him to come and put boots to the ground.

"British women are suspected of running sex slave brothels for Islamic State fighters in Syria. They are among scores of European women who have flocked to the warzone in the hope of becoming ‘jihadi brides’. Academic experts monitoring the lawless region have identified at least 11 women linked to frontline fighters. Scroll down for video . British jihadi brides have been messaging each other on Twitter about life in Raqqa, Syria (pictured), including posts about sex slaves taken from the minority Yazidi religious group . They were shocked to discover references to sex slaves including a British fundamentalist complaining that one Yazidi girl dared to look her in the eye. Hundreds of girls and women belonging to the Kurdish religious minority have been kidnapped, tortured and raped by the terrorist group. Yet despite the horror stories of their treatment there is growing evidence of British women being drawn to the region support militant fighters. Melanie Smith, of the King’s College International Centre for the Study of Radicalisation, said there are ‘hundreds’ of girls who want to travel across Europe to Syria. ‘Hundreds. I come across girls every day who say, ‘I’m so desperate to go over there but it’s just so hard for me,’ she said. ‘The proportion of girls who eventually make the transition from wanting to go to physically going is tiny. But there are so many people that want to go. And it’s fairly overwhelming.’ Miss Smith said that once the women arrive in Syria getting married to one of the many foreign fighters is easy. She said there is even a ‘Jihad Matchmaker’ service on Twitter in which women can post photographs of themselves for the men to choose from. Among those who have travelled from Britain are Manchester twins Salma and Zahra Halane, 16, who fled their family home in the middle of the night in June. Glaswegian public schoolgirl Aqsa Mahmood, 20, was reported missing by her parents a year ago before surfacing in Syria in February as an outspoken supporter of the terrorist group. Khadijah Dare, 22, arranged to marry an Islamic State fighter via Facebook and moved to Syria in 2012. She now posts photographs online of her son holding an AK-47. Aqsa Mahmood, 20 (left) and Salma Halane, 16, are among the British women known to be in Syria. Another, Umm Farriss wrote recently to complain that one sex slave had looked her in the eye . Many women are apparently lured to Syria by the prolific online activities of fighters who work hard to present a ‘romantic’ image of the bloodshed. They exchange messages on sites including Facebook, Twitter and Ask.fm, often including marriage proposals, before travelling to Syria via Turkey. Once in the country, most likely in the stronghold of Raqqa, the must adhere to hardline sharia law, including wearing the niqab, and find themselves cooking and cleaning. Some even post blogs about their lives, including tips on cooking high calorie meals for their thin partners who are losing weight on the battlefield. They offer advice to other women considering travelling to Syria, including the fact that chocolate is difficult to come by but hair straighteners can be bought. One British woman, Umm Farriss, wrote recently on social media complaining that a sex slave had dared to look her in the eye. A teenager posted a picture of Adolf Hitler with the words, ‘I could have extinguished every Jew in Europe but I left them so you would be able to do it for me.’ Another commented ‘I wish I did it’ after being asked about the murder of Israeli-American journalist Steven Sotloff. Miss Smith said seven of the British women live and work together and are married to husbands who all fight alongside one another. She said many are answering a call for women with no specialist or professional skills to help them build a new Islamic state. ‘It’s very much a domestic housewife role at best,’ she said. ‘It’s not much of a life.’ Asked why women would want to join Islamic State she added: ‘There may be pressure from parents: you should study for your A levels so you can go to university so you can be a doctor or a lawyer or an engineer … . ‘There’s a lot of that kind of mentality. It’s laziness, really. And they’re bored with their life here. They say they have more freedom in IS. ‘They see eight women living in a house in Raqqa who all get on famously and they tweet each other all the time. ‘That’s something they haven’t had, the sense of community and independence.’","At least 11 British women have been identified as linked to ISIS fighters .

"Pennsylvania officials have been left red-faced over misprinted new bridge signs honoring a slain Civil War hero. The West Crawford Avenue Bridge in Connellsville has been renamed the Officer McCray Robb Bridge in remembrance of the 33-year-old veteran who was shot dead three weeks after joining the police force in May 1882. However, when the new signage was unveiled Monday, workers were quick to spot that the first and last names had been printed back to front. Misprint: The West Crawford Avenue Bridge in Connellsville has been renamed the Officer McCray Robb Bridge in remembrance of the 33-year-old veteran who was shot dead in May 1882 . The plaques, produced by Pennsylvania Department of Transportation (PennDOT), list the bridge's new name as Officer Robb McCray Bridge. Connellsville police Officer McCray Robb was killed while helping another officer arrest two drunk brothers at a traveling circus. The brother who shot him in the chest was accused of murder and was originally sentenced to death. But he received a second trial in which he was convicted of second degree murder. Remembered: More 3,000 Connellsville residents reportedly attended Robb’s funeral with community donations covering all of the costs . More 3,000 Connellsville residents reportedly attended Robb’s funeral with community donations covering all of the costs. A ceremony renaming the borough's West Crawford Avenue Bridge in Robb's honor was held Saturday with the signs installed in the designated locations two days later. PennDOT spokeswoman Valerie Petersen told the Pittsburgh Tribune-Review the signs were printed based on the bill sponsored by retiring Democratic state Sen. Richard Kasunic. An aide for incoming Republican state Sen. Pat Stefano says the lawmaker will work to correct the mistake, perhaps by sponsoring an amended bill.","The West Crawford Avenue Bridge in Connellsville has been renamed the Officer McCray Robb Bridge .

"An Alabama minister who confessed to having sex with church members without telling them he had AIDS is fighting through the courts to keep his job. Circuit Judge Charles Price yesterday said he will rule within a week on whether Reverend Juan McFarland can return to Shiloh Missionary Baptist Church in Montgomery or whether a temporary ban from the church will become permanent. McFarland's attorney argued that the church approved bylaws in January 2013 giving the pastor his job for life. He said a vote that decided to ban McFarland from the church in October was improper. Reverend Juan McFarland, who confessed to having sex with church members without telling them he had AIDS, is fighting through the courts to keep his job . McFarland, right, has argued the Shiloh Missionary Baptist Church approved bylaws in January 2013 giving him his job for life and that a vote leading to him being banned from the church in October was improper  vote that decided to ban McFarland from the church in October was improper . An attorney for the church's deacons and trustees argued that McFarland pushed through the 2013 bylaws improperly and that the October vote was valid. McFarland had served the church for 23 years before he confessed to his congregation that he suffered from AIDS. In October Judge Price issued a preliminary injunction -  which had been sought by the deacons and trustees of the church - requiring McFarland to return his church keys and church-provided Mercedes and to stay away from the place of worship. Church members hugged and prayed after the ruling. 'Now we've got the church back, and the healing can begin,' said Lois Caffey, a member for 21 years, said at the time. After that ruling, McFarland returned to the church and met with leaders in a private session. He then turned in his keys and left, less than an hour ahead of the judge's deadline. Earlier the preacher had confessed to his affairs, his AIDS diagnosis and that he had been abusing drugs in a series of sermons that stunned church-goers. McFarland confessed to his affairs, his AIDS diagnosis and that he had been abusing drugs in a series of sermons in August and September that stunned his parishioners . Shiloh Missionary Baptist Church in Montgomery where McFarland is temporarily banned from . Parishioners reacted with astonishment, and some urgently sought tests to see if they had been infected.  Some called for the reverend to be jailed. Following McFarland's confessions, the church's board of trustees chairman Lee Sanford said the challenge now was to reunite the 170 active members of the congregation. He said:  'I'm confident with God's help we will be able to do that.' The plaintiffs in the lawsuit said the congregation voted to fire McFarland after his confessions but that he refused to leave and changed the church's locks and how the church bank accounts could be accessed. The boards of deacons and trustees sued McFarland after he preached on October 12 despite the vote to fire him a week earlier. Circuit Judge Charles Price yesterday said he will rule within a week on whether McFarland can return to the church or whether a temporary ban will become permanent . One of the plaintiffs, Deacon Nathan Williams Jr, said church leaders had no suspicions about McFarland until he delivered sermons in August and September, revealing his dark secrets. McFarland has said that God had directed him to make the confessions. Williams said that the congregation first tried to help the pastor but that when it didn't work, members took a vote on whether to fire him. He said some were upset that McFarland tried to fire several longtime church officials and others were concerned about taking communion from the ill minister or having him around their children. Price said the courts have no role in religious matters, but they sometimes have to step in when congregations can't settle their differences over control of buildings and money. Judge Price said at the first court hearing: 'If it could be resolved in the church, it would have been already.'

"Controversial former Toronto mayor Rob Ford was welcomed back to the city's council last night despite battling a rare form of cancer. Mr Ford was replaced as mayor of Canada's largest city after his term in office was plagued with scandals involving public drinking and crack cocaine use. He was diagnosed with cancer earlier this year and announced in September that he wouldn't be seeking re-election as mayor. Scroll down for video . Former mayor Rob Ford, left, was welcomed back to Toronto City Council last night after stepping down as mayor following his cancer diagnosis . But despite his illness, he opted to seek a suburban seat on the City Council, where he first launched his political career and gained a faithful following that became known as Ford Nation. He won his old seat with a landslide victory and took his place in the council chamber last night where he greeted new Toronto mayor John Tory. Mr Tory then declared a motion to thank Mr Ford for his public service, which passed unanimously and the pair then shared a fist bump. The 45-year-old began his fourth round of treatment on Monday and avoids shaking hands to keep himself from exposure to germs during chemotherapy. Mr Ford won a suburban seat on the council in the recent election and the 45-year-old began his fourth round of chemotherapy treatment earlier this week . The 45-year-old former mayor was diagnosed with a rare form of cancer in September and doctors have told him he only has a 50 per cent chance of survival . He was diagnosed with a rare form of cancer of the abdomen, called malignant liposarcoma, and has said that doctors have told him that he only has a 50 per cent chance of survival. After months of denials, Mr Ford acknowledged in 2013 that he had smoked crack cocaine in one of his 'drunken stupors,' but he refused to resign. The City Council stripped him of most of his powers but lacked the authority to force him out of office because he wasn't convicted of a crime. Ford's antics made him the target of late-night television comedians in the U.S. and last March, he appeared on 'Jimmy Kimmel Live!' after months of wooing by the talk-show host. Mr Ford became a controversial figure during his term in office and  in 2013 admitted that he smoked crack cocaine during a 'drunken stupor' Mr Ford holding one of his 'Robbie Bobbie' bobblehead dolls. Last week he revealed he would be selling off the remainder of the dolls to raise money for the hospitals that have been treating him . Mr Ford's appearance at the City Council chamber comes just weeks after he revealed he would be selling off his remaining 'Robbie Bobbie' bobblehead dolls to raise money for the hospitals that have been treating his cancer. Supporters can buy the collectors' items at the mayor's office for $26 each with the proceeds going to support two hospitals, Humber River Hospital and Mount Sinai Hospital. Last week hundreds of Ford's supporters began lining up outside his office, hours before the pale former mayo showed up to sign the bobbleheads. The 45-year-old politician was visibly unwell, struggling to speak and keep his eyes open. Toronto's new Mayor John Tory stands in the council chamber during his inauguration ceremony in Toronto yesterday. He has been described as a straight-laced, button down moderate conservative . 'I am not myself,' he was quoted by CTV as telling reporters. 'I'm still doing phone calls, still going out, taking care of my constituents. I haven't gotten my fire in my belly yet. I have to get that back. I really want to get that back.' Meanwhile Mr Ford's successor Mr Tory, has been described as a straight-laced, button down moderate conservative. He has previously said that said he will restore trust and faith in the office and vowed during the campaign to end the circus at City Hall and to get people moving with a new public transit plan.","Rob Ford appeared at Toronto City Hall for a council meeting last night .

"Ireland will ask the European Court of Human Rights to reopen a landmark case against Britain over the use of alleged torture in Northern Ireland. On the back of new evidence, Amnesty International and other human rights organisations pressed Dublin to relaunch proceedings in the so-called 'Hooded Men' case. They were 14 Catholic men interned - detained indefinitely without trial - in 1971 who claimed they were subjected to a number of torture methods. Nine of the 14 'Hooded Men'. (From left-right) Back row: Patrick McNally, Brian Turley, Francie McGuigan, Joe Clarke; Middle Row: Michael Donnelly, Gerry McKerr, Jiam Auld; Front Row: Kevin Hannaway, Liam Shannon, and standing side-on Colm O'Gorman, the executive director of Amnesty Ireland . These included five techniques, hooding, stress positions, white noise, sleep deprivation and deprivation of food and water, along with beatings and death threats. The men were hooded and flown by helicopter to a secret location, later revealed as a British Army camp at Ballykelly, outside Londonderry. None were ever convicted. A documentary on Irish State broadcaster RTE in June disclosed fresh evidence that the British Government authorised the 'deep interrogation' tactics at the highest levels. Confirming Ireland's approach to Europe, Foreign Affairs Minister Charlie Flanagan said the fresh evidence was taken very seriously by Dublin and legal advice was also sought. 'On the basis of the new material uncovered, it will be contended that the ill-treatment suffered by the Hooded Men should be recognised as torture,' he said. The men say they were forced to stand in 'stress positions', as demonstrated by these Amnesty International campaigners in this file picture, for long periods of time by their British captors . 'The Government's decision was not taken lightly. 'As EU partners, UK and Ireland have worked together to promote human rights in many forms and during the original case, the UK did not contest before the European Court of Human Rights that a breach of Article 3 of the European Convention of Human rights took place. 'The British and Irish governments have both worked hard to build stronger more trusting relations in recent years and I believe that this relationship will now stand to us as we work through the serious matters raised by these cases which have come to light in recent months.' The Irish government first took a human rights case against Britain over the alleged torture in 1971. The European Commission ruled that the mistreatment of the men was torture, but in 1978 the European Court of Human Rights held that the men suffered inhumane and degrading treatment that was not torture. The UK did not dispute the finding. The men were taken to a British Army camp at Ballykelly, outside Londonderry . The new evidence, uncovered from national archives in London by the human rights outfit The Pat Finucane Centre, throws doubt over the ruling by the European Court of Human Rights. It includes a letter dated 1977 from then-home secretary Merlyn Rees to then-prime minister James Callaghan in which he states his view that the decision to use 'methods of torture in Northern Ireland in 1971/72 was taken by ministers - in particular Lord Carrington, then secretary of state for defence'. Mr Rees added that 'a political decision was taken'. The Irish government had until December 4 - six months after the new evidence came to light - to inform Europe if it wanted the case reopened. A High Court case was launched in Dublin seeking to compel the Cabinet into acting. Amnesty International said the reopening of the case would help the surviving 'Hooded Men' and the families of those who have died to their right to truth and justice . 'The UK withheld from the European Court what it knew about the terrible suffering deliberately inflicted on them and its being sanctioned at the highest levels of the UK Government,' said spokesman Colm O'Gorman. 'Ireland's decision today bravely flies the flag for human rights and the universal and unconditional prohibition of torture.' Liam Shannon, one of the 14 men, said they were absolutely delighted. 'We've waited 43 years and we want to thank everyone involved, our legal team and all the researchers who turned up the relevant information in order that we could make a case and we'd particularly like to thank Amnesty International for their assistance,' he added. Paul O'Connor, of The Pat Finucane Centre, said three successive British governments had deliberately deceived the European court over the case, which has since been used to justify techniques in Afghanistan, Iraq and Guantanamo. 'The recently discovered documents show the British government withheld vital medical, legal and policy documents from both the European Court and the Irish government in respect of the case taken by the Irish state on torture,' he added.","'Hooded Men' were 14 Catholics who claimed they were  tortured .

"A Cleveland policeman who fatally shot a 12-year-old thought the boy's pellet gun was a real firearm and later said he had no choice, the officer's father said. The November 22 shooting of Tamir Rice by 26-year-old police rookie Tim Loehmann outside a recreation center sparked protests in the area. Surveillance video shows Loehmann firing within two seconds of a patrol car stopping near Tamir, who reached in his waistband for what turned out to be a pellet gun. Loehmann's father, Fred Loehmann, told Cleveland.com that the officer didn't know how young the boy was. Loehmann revealed that his son initially was in shock after the shooting, but is now doing 'pretty well.' He also said his son is seeing his friends and going to church. Scroll down for video . Family: Tamir Rice (seen here with his mother Sam) was fatally shot by Cleveland police officer Tim Loehmann . Officer: Timothy Loehmann, seen far left, fatally shot Tamir Rice. His father Fred Loehmann has said that his thought the boy's pellet gun was a real firearm and said he had no choice . Video: Rice is seen holding a pellet gun - allegedly in the direction of Cudell Recreation Center . Fred Loehmann did reveal, however, that the family has received threats since police identified his son. 'As soon as his name flashed on the screen [during the televised press conference], the phone started ringing,'  Loehmann told Cleveland.com. 'We had to turn our phones off.' Tim Loehmann went to both Benedictine High School and Tiffin University, before leaving to attend Cuyahoga Community College, Cleveland.com reported. In high school, Loehmann was a marching band trumpet player, basketball scorekeeper, and German Club member - and in college was a basketball player and marching band trumpet player, according to the website. He also reportedly received a failure to control citation stemming from a traffic accident, and at age 17 had been charged with underage drinking. He was an officer with the Independence Police Department, then went to the Cleveland police academy before he started work in the Fourth District, Fred Loehmann told Cleveland.com. He also said his son became bored with being a police officer in suburban Independence. Victim: Surveillance video shows Loehmann firing within two seconds of a patrol car stopping near Tamir, who reached in his waistband for what turned out to be a pellet gun . Police: Cleveland police officers are seen arriving at Cudell Park following a report of a man with a gun . Announcement: Deputy Chief Ed Tomba, pictured at podium, has said that Cleveland was releasing the surveillance video at the behest of Tamir Rice's family . Protest: Demonstrators lay down in Public Square on November 25 in Cleveland during a protest over the shooting of Tamir Rice . Police officers monitor the demonstrators in Public Square . Fred Loehmann is a veteran of both the NYPD and the U.S. Marshals Service, Cleveland.com reported. He told the news outlet that he understands something about the situation his son faced because of an experience he had during his own career in New York in 1972. He saw an armed robbery suspect with something silver in his hand but opted not to shoot, and it was revealed the item was actually a gun-shaped cigarette lighter, he said. 'If it would have been a real gun, I'd be dead,' he said. New York police couldn't verify that information, but a spokesman confirmed to Cleveland.com that an F. Loehmann worked there for two decades. The relatives of Tamir Rice declined to offer a comment to the media outlet regarding Loehmann's information, via a spokesperson for their lawyer David Malik. His spokesperson Stan Donaldson reportedly said 'The family is grieving, as any family who lost a 12-year-old would be. They thought they would be spending this holiday with their son.' Loehmann fired within 1½ to 2 seconds of pulling up in his cruiser, police said Wednesday. During those few moments, he ordered the Rice three times to put up his hands, they said. The city released a surveillance video that shows the shooting of Rice, who was carrying an airsoft gun that shoots non-lethal plastic pellets. Much of the footage shows what appears to be a bored kid alone in a park on an unseasonably warm November afternoon. Tamir is seen pacing, occasionally extending his right arm with what appears to be a gun in his hand, talking on a cellphone and sitting at a picnic table with his head resting on his arms. The gun wasn't real. It can be bought at sporting goods stores for less than $20. Tamir's was lacking the bright orange tip that is usually put on such weapons to indicate they're not real guns. Tamir's family said it has seen the video of his shooting. 'It is our belief that this situation could have been avoided and that Tamir should still be here with us,' the family said last week in a statement released by its attorneys. 'The video shows one thing distinctly: the police officers reacted quickly.' Loehmann was identified last week on Wednesday as the patrol officer who shot Tamir. He is a 26-year-old rookie who began his career in Cleveland on March 3. He previously spent five months in 2012 with a department in suburban Independence, but four of those months were in that city's police academy. Loehmann's partner that day was identified as Frank Garmback, 46. He has been with the department since 2008. Loehmann and Garmback have come back to work following administrative leave and are not on patrol, Cleveland.com reported. The video police showed Wednesday had no sound and was choppy, showing about two frames per second. What is striking about it is the speed at which the shooting occurred. At one moment, Tamir is sitting at a picnic table in a gazebo. He stands, and a police car zooms into the frame from the right and stops on the grass, just a few feet from him. The passenger door opens and Loehmann shoots Tamir before Garmback can get out the driver's side door. It's unclear how far Tamir was from Loehmann when the officer shot him, but Deputy Chief Ed Tomba said it was less than 10 feet. The low-resolution video shows Tamir reaching to his waistband and then bending over after being shot. His body is mostly obscured by the patrol car when he falls to the ground. Garmback can be seen walking around the car and kicking what is said to be the airsoft gun away from Tamir. Memorial: Stuffed animals, candles and notes are seen in a memorial for 12-year-old Tamir Rice . Remembered: A protester holds up  a picture of Tamir Rice, rookie police officer, during a protest in response to a grand jury's decision to not indict police officer Darren Wilson at the Department of Justice in D.C. Tomba told reporters at the news conference  on Wednesday that an FBI agent who was working a bank robbery detail nearby arrived within a few minutes and administered first aid to Tamir. Paramedics arrived three minutes later. The boy died on Sunday at a Cleveland hospital. Tomba said the city was releasing the video at the behest of Tamir's family. 'This is not an effort to exonerate. It's not an effort to show the public that anybody did anything wrong,' Tomba said. 'This is an obvious tragic event where a young member of our community lost their life. We've got two officers that were out there protecting the public that just had to, you know, do something that nobody wants to do.' On Saturday, a person had called 911 about a male pointing a gun at others at the park. The caller told the 911 dispatcher that the gun was 'probably fake,' then added, 'I don't know if it's real or not.' Tomba would not discuss statements the two officers gave after the shooting, saying they were part of the investigation. Nor would he discuss details of the radio conversation between the officers and a dispatcher except to say they were apprised that they were on a 'gun run.' The family thanked the city for releasing the video publicly and said it awaits the results of the police investigation.","The November 22 shooting of Tamir Rice by police rookie Tim Loehmann sparked protests in the Cleveland area .

"Sunshine. Remember that? In gloomy winter months it’s not just the warmth of the sun’s rays you miss — you may also suffer lower levels of vitamin D, the sunshine vitamin. Vitamin D is important for bone health — low levels are linked to fractures in adults and rickets in children. Last week, a report by the NHS advisory body the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE), said more people should be given vitamin D tablets to counter a hidden epidemic of deficiency . Last week, a report by the NHS advisory body the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE), said more people should be given vitamin D tablets to counter a hidden epidemic of deficiency, with ten million people across England possibly affected. Many thousands rely on supplements on prescription to ensure their levels are adequate. Two years ago, the country’s chief medical officers highlighted the need for vitamin D to be given to pregnant and breastfeeding women, children under five and the elderly. Prescriptions soared as a result. However, NHS figures suggest the majority are being made up not with supplements licensed for medical use, but with food supplements that are not subjected to the same rigorous controls. Indeed, 59 per cent of the 190,000 prescriptions issued in England every month for vitamin D are being made up with unlicensed products, according to NHS Prescription Cost Analysis data for 2013. Experts warn this could lead to patients getting the wrong dose — they may continue to be deficient or end up with too much vitamin D (which leads to more calcium being absorbed from the gut, raising the risk of bone pain and kidney stones). ‘It’s outrageous that unlicensed vitamin D products are prescribed when licensed ones are available,’ says Dr Peter Feldschreiber, a medical barrister and author of The Law And Regulation Of Medicines. ‘Patients are being put at risk because there’s no quality control. 'With a licensed medicine, all its ingredients are known, have been tested and their safety at the stated dose confirmed. 'But the content of unlicensed vitamin D products can vary hugely.’ Some provide just 8 per cent of the stated dose, while others deliver 201 per cent, according to research published in Nutrition Health and Aging in 2013. Two years ago, the country’s chief medical officers highlighted the need for vitamin D to be given to pregnant and breastfeeding women, children under five and the elderly. Prescriptions soared as a result . Dr Feldschreiber, a former senior medical assessor with the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), says a sample analysed for a different study found ‘one product had only 14 per cent of the stated dose while another had 171 per cent’. The number of vitamin D prescriptions has risen by 8,000 per cent since 2008. The problem is that prescribers have only six licensed medicines at their disposal and they do not come in every dosing permutation, says Dr Brian Curwain, a clinical scientist and independent pharmaceutical consultant. Licensed products come in doses of 800, 3,200, 10,000 and 25,000 international units. So when a GP writes a prescription for 1,000 units, that can be filled only by an unlicensed product. ‘If the pharmacist wants to dispense the licensed 800 unit medicine instead, he’d have to ask the doctor if the prescription can be amended,’ says Dr Curwain. ‘Community pharmacists are often too busy, so the unlicensed product is dispensed.’ He is also concerned that food supplement manufacturers can change the formulation of their product without notice. ‘It looks the same, but the ingredients may include something you’re allergic to,’ he says. The Royal Pharmaceutical Society says the situation is ‘worrying’. So why does it continue? Surprisingly, licensed medications are 50 per cent cheaper than unlicensed products, says Dr Feldschreiber. The problem is that while licensed medicines fall within the MHRA’s remit, food supplements do not. Yet the Food Standards Agency claims they are not its responsibility, either. A spokesman for the MHRA said: ‘NHS prescribing policy and practice is the responsibility of the Department of Health.’ Meanwhile, a spokesman for the Department of Health said: ‘Where there is no licensed product to meet a patient’s needs, it is appropriate that prescribers can prescribe another product.’ In its first draft of its new guidance in May, NICE made no mention of the importance of filling vitamin D prescriptions with licensed medicines, a decision that was criticised by the Royal Pharmaceutical Society. In its latest guidance, it urges the Department of Health to work with manufacturers to ensure licensed vitamin D products containing the recommended nutrient intake are available on prescription and supplements should undergo quality checks to ensure they contain the correct dose. However, there is no mention of who is responsible for carrying out such checks on the unlicensed ones on sale in the High Street. The good news is that from next year two additional licensed products — one of 400 units and another of 25,000 units — will be available.","Vitamin D is important for bone health .

"Bowler Sean Abbott has returned to the cricket pitch a week after the tragic accident which claimed the life of batsman Phillip Hughes. A bouncer delivered by Abbott struck Hughes, 25, in the back of the neck during the Sheffield Shield clash at the Sydney Cricket Ground last Tuesday. He died surrounded in hospital by family and friends on Thursday. Abbott's team, the New South Wales Blues, today rallied around each other at a training session at the SCG. 'It's the whole squad that really needs everyone's support,' a spokeswoman for Cricket NSW told Daily Mail Australia. Scroll down for video . New South Wales quick Sean Abbott has returned to the pitch . 'We want to keep supporting them as a group there were a lot of Phillip's friends in the team,' she said. The team will fly together to Macksville, the felled cricketer's hometown on the NSW north coast, on Wednesday morning and return Thursday. The Sydney Cricket Ground will also be open to the public tomorrow for the wider community to join celebrations of Hughes' life. As Macksville readies for an influx of 5000 mourners tomorrow, a family member told Daily Mail Australia they were planning to console Abbott. 'We can't wait to see Sean Abbott tomorrow and give him a big kiss and hug,' the family member told Daily Mail Australia. 'We just want to tell him it was freak accident and he cannot think he had anything to do with it. 'No one is blaming him. We want to hug him and tell him that everything is okay.' Abbott delivered the ball that felled Hughes last Tuesday afternoon . Tragic accident: Sean Abbott left hospital on Thursday surrounded by friends, including former Test opener Simon Katich (left) and another mate (right) Late last week, friends and mentors at the Baulkham Hills Cricket Club, the north-western Sydney institution where Abbott grew up belting balls, joined countless Australians in rallying around the up-and-coming-cricketer. When one of 'Sabs's' team-mates dropped a crucial catch as a youngster, he was always the good sportsman who would pat them on the back and reassure them it would be OK, they said. Ian Chatman, who managed Abbott's junior team for about eight years and witnessed his first century, told Daily Mail Australia he was a grounded young man who was 'loved by everyone, and still is.' 'He was really loved by his team-mates, and he cared about them as well,' said Mr Chatman, who said Abbott would be 'devastated' by Tuesday's events. 'He was always making sure that you know, if someone dropped a catch, he'd be over there patting them on the back saying, ""Don't worry about it, it's okay"".' Hughes' sister Megan and Australian skipper Michael Clarke both consoled the devastated cricketer in the immediate aftermath of his friend's death. And they were far from alone. Prime Minister Tony Abbott and Opposition Leader Bill Shorten both spoke in support of the struggling cricketer. Former Australian national Test captain Adam Gilchrist tweeted: 'May those footprints in the sand now support another young man in need. #SeanAbbott'. Australian skipper Michael Clarke posted this tribute to his 'little brother' Phillip Hughes on Instagram this week . Elaborate tribute: A woman looks on at floral tributes to Phillip Hughes at a shopfront in his hometown of Macksville . RIP Boofa: One of hundreds of tributes laid about town in Macksville on Friday . Abbott, who Club sources said was a focused and mature player even in his youth, is an inspiration for many of the young people who take to the pitch at 'Baulko'. 'We're very proud of him for being our first Australian representative,' said Baulkham Hills Cricket Club Vice President Peter McLoughlin. His love of sport was encouraged at Hills Sports High School, near Seven Hills in Sydney's west, and he was playing representative cricket for Parramatta by his mid-teens. Abbott, who has rugby league in his blood, has had a stellar 2014 on the pitch despite the recent accident. He came to the attention of national selectors in May when he took out the Steve Waugh Medal, the Sheffield Shield's best player of the season - a high honour. 'He's a genuine type of guy who's worked hard to get there and he knows where he came from, if you know what I mean,' Mr McLoughlin told Daily Mail Australia. 'All kids want to be Allan Border or Steve Waugh or bloody something and when you see a bloke who played for your club, they all know hard work will get them there, hopefully.' Mr Chatman said: 'He'll just be so devastated it's a ball he bowled. For him, I know he'll really struggle.' But, Mr Chatman said, he's got plenty of support.","Sean Abbott and the New South Wales Blues returned to the pitch a week after Phillip Hughes' death .

"A businessman has been ordered to pay his wealthy ex-wife around £17million after a family court judge branded him a 'unprincipled rogue'. Judge Sir Peter Singer said property investor Didier Thiry, 53, had shown a 'sadistic side to his personality' since his relationship with Alisa Thiry, 50, broke down. Ms Thiry - who was previously married to Stephen Marks, founder of high street chain French Connection - pocketed a £37million divorce settlement a decade ago, said Sir Peter. In her latest divorce, the former model claimed Mr Thiry  refused to honour the terms of a pre-nuptial agreement and demanded he return a loan her company made to his during their marriage. Didier Thiry (left) has been ordered to pay his ex-wife Alisa (right) a £17million divorce settlement . The judge said the eight-figure sum he awarded Ms Thiry could be described as 'restorative justice'. He also ordered Mr Thiry  to pay Ms Thiry's £456,000 legal bills. Details of the award emerged in a ruling by the judge following private hearings in the Family Division of the High Court in London. Sir Peter said the couple had separated in 2013 after marrying in 2006, having entered into a pre-nuptial agreement. The judge said that, at the time of the agreement, Ms Thiry had disclosed assets of nearly £32.3million and Mr Thiry assets of about £8.3million. Ms Thiry's lawyer, Shona Alexander, said after the ruling that her client had never sought any of Mr Thiry's money for herself. 'She solely tried to ensure that a clear pre-nuptial agreement was abided by,' said Ms Alexander. 'That agreement said that each of them should, if they divorced, simply be left in the same position they were in when they married. She added: 'Accordingly, Ms Thiry has been trying to get back from Mr Thiry what was once hers alone, and which they agreed would always be hers alone in the future. 'Mr Thiry sadly refused to honour the terms of the pre-nuptial agreement.' It is the second big-money divorce settlement for Ms Thiry, who was awarded £37million after a previous split . Mrs Thiry is the daughter of Raymond Chapman and his wife, Valerie, both hairdressers. She was born Alisa Chapman in Cheltenham in 1964 but changed her name to Green after her mother's marriage to Ronald Green in 1973. She and Mr Thiry, a French national who is a well-known figure in Belgium thanks to his flourishing hospitality empire, were married overseas. The judge said Mr Thirly (left) was 'an unprincipled rogue who has acted in a financially predatory fashion to prey on his wife' Their acrimonious divorce battle emerged earlier this year, when it was revealed they were squabbling over their £40million fortune. When the pre-nup was made, Ms Thiry owned an £11million house in London and a property in St Barts in the French Antilles valued at £7million. Mr Thiry claimed that, as a result of his organisation of her business interests, his ex-wife profited by more than £20million. But the judge branded the Frenchman's claim 'demonstrably nonsense' today. A key bone of contention was a £13.8million loan a company owned by Alisa made to a company owned by Didier. Ms Thiry said her background was 'fashion and design-orientated' and had told Sir Peter 'my forte is not financial matters'. She said Mr Thiry had told her that he was an 'experienced investor and financial expert' and she had 'trusted' his advice and he had told her that she 'did not need to worry'. The judge today ordered that the inter-company debt be repaid to Ms Thiry. The ruling comes after another judge sentenced Mr Thiry to four months in jail in May for contempt of court for failing to disclose information relating to the loan to court. The court heard today that he remains in Belgium and has not served the sentence. He previously said that, in Britain, 'the coffee is terrible, especially in prison I guess'. Sir Peter said Mr Thiry had not appeared at hearings, but he said he had 'read a good deal that emanates from him'. 'In regard to his wife and since their relationship broke down he has manifested a manipulative and, it might even be said, a sadistic side to his personality,' said Sir Peter, adding: 'He can be haughty, menacing and downright rude in tone.' Sir Peter said Mr Thiry had called his wife and her lawyers 'insignificant pieces of s***'. He said Mr Thiry had 'bombarded' Ms Thiry with communications during the course of proceedings which were 'sneering, superior and supercilious' in tone. And he asked: 'So why does Didier Thiry so steadfastly refrain from honouring his word rather than run the risk that one might conclude (as I have done) that he is an unprincipled rogue who has acted in a financially predatory fashion to prey on his wife for his own profit and to her substantial detriment?' In a statement released in May, Ms Thirly sent out a warning to the media against 'repeating the offensive suggestion that despite being a successful journalist and businesswoman I have somehow made a career out of marrying for money.' Alisa Thiry, pictured with previous first husband Stephen Marks, said the money originally belonged to her .","Property tycoon ordered to pay his ex-wife £17million divorce settlement .

"A top Tory has been secretly recorded dismissing 'dog-end voters' in the north who want higher taxes on the rich. Former banker Mark Garnier said appealing to poor families in 'the outlying regions of the country' risked damaging the economy. Mr Garnier - a member of the powerful Commons Treasury Committee – made the shock remarks during a meeting in Westminster. Tory MP Mark Garnier referred to some voters as 'dog end' A tape the sneering remarks was recorded and passed to The Sun newspaper. It comes after Plebgate Tory Andrew Mitchell was found guilty of launching a foul-mouthed tirade at Downing Street police officers. Ex cabinet minister David Mellor was also recorded ranting at a taxi driver just days after Labour's shadow attorney general Emily Thornberry was sacked for sending a 'sneering' tweet about a white van owner with England flags. Mr Garnier was speaking at the Institute of Economic Affairs debating taxes on the rich. The 51-year-old MP for Wyre Forest said businessmen were being put off by government's hiking their taxes to appeal to poorer voters. Mr Garnier said entrepreneurs were 'worried about what is going to happen to their own personal rates of tax'. He added: 'We need to be giving a much clearer message to them that they don't have to worry about politicians mucking around with tax rates in order to try and attract a few, sort, of dog-end voters in the outlying regions of the country.' He then added: 'Not that they are not important – but what is important, what is important, is that businesses can feel surety in what is happening within tax rates.' Labour said remarks revealed the 'true face' of the Conservative party. Andrew Mitchell, with his wife Dr Sharon Bennett, was found to have called Downing Street police 'f****** plebs' Former Conservative cabinet minister David Mellor called a taxi driver a 'sweaty, stupid little s***' Jon Ashworth said: 'Today's latest embarrassment from a Tory MP exposes the reality that the 'nasty party' never really changed. 'The truth is that David Cameron's claims to lead a compassionate Conservative Party are now as robust as his deficit reduction timetable. 'He has failed to modernise his party, just as he has failed to deliver his pledge to balance the nation's finances.' 'I hope Mr Garnier can now explain to thousands upon thousands of our hardworking constituents why he considers them 'dog-end voters'? 'I fear the truth is the Tories' economic failure and this high-handed dismissal of working people are intrinsically linked. Recent outbursts from Lord Freud, David Mellor, Andrew Mitchell and now Mark Garnier show just how out of touch David Cameron's party has become.' Islington South & Finsbury MP Emily Thornberry was sacked after sending a 'sneering' tweet about a white-van owners home . The Labour frontbencher  defended posting the image, claiming she had never seen anything like it . Mr Ashworth added: 'If the Tories understood hardworking Britain, if they understood that the people holding down multiple jobs to make ends meet are not the 'dog end' but the engines of our economy, this wouldn't be their record in government. 'When George Osborne stands up tomorrow we know that he will seek to mask a record of economic failure that is now all too apparent for everyone to see. 'But what he will not be able to escape is that the mask is slipping on a Tory Party who stands up for a privileged few because they simply don't understand hardworking Britain.' Mr Garnier issued a full grovelling apology last night. He said: ""If I used slack language in order to make a point, I am sorry if I caused any offence to anybody. ""Certainly no offence is intended. I believe every voter is important everywhere.""","Mark Garnier said appealing to voters with high taxes would hit economy .

"Its head-turning billboards sky-rocketed Wonderbra into the forefront of the women's lingerie market where it's remained for 20 years. And now the cleavage creator is celebrating two decades in affluent business with a birthday cake and catwalk show in Madrid. The presentation was held at Ramses Club in the Spanish city on Wednesday, and saw an array of models clad in various styles from its current collection celebrate in style as they blew out candles. Wonderbra celebrates 20 years with a cake and show at Ramses Club in Madrid with an array of stunning Spanish models . Topless models in suit pants show off a black and nude pining bra and a raspberry floral design one . Wonderbra's 'Hello Boys' advert was the 1994 billboard that - quite literally - stopped traffic . The Wonderbra name was first trademarked in the U.S. in 1955, and the brand was developed in Canada over the next 40 years. But it only really gained worldwide prominence in the 1990s. The bra's redesign and reintroduction in 1994 saw a £16m advertising campaign in the US and UK including billboards showing models wearing only the Wonderbra. Underneath read slogans such as 'who cares if it's a bad hair day?' and 'look me in the eyes and tell me that you love me'. Wonderbra's iconic Hello Boys advert was the 1994 billboard that - quite literally - stopped traffic. Makers of the ad were honoured in 2011, when the billboard was declared the most eye-catching ad of the previous 20 years.

A model gives the camera a cheeky wink as she wears a fish scale effect sparkly grey and silver bra . Appraisal from ad professionals aside, the Hello Boys poster aroused the ire of feminists, many of whom described it as degrading. But Eva Herzigova, the model who starred in the ad, opened up about the criticism she received at the time and said far from being degrading, it was actually empowering. 'My Wonderbra campaign empowered women,' said Czech-born Eva, 43. 'It didn’t degrade them like some said or say.

Each Mediterranean beauty wore a different colour and style of the world famous bra to celebrate 20 years since its relaunch . Wonderbra celebrates 20 years with a cake and show at Ramses Club in Madrid with a host of Spanish models . Speaking to the Evening Standard, she continued: 'It was controversial at the time, sure - but it made waves and you can see its influence still today. 'It was one of the most successful advertising campaigns in history and I am so proud to be a part of it.' The advert, which was shot by Ellen von Unwerth and saw Eva posing in a black Wonderbra and pants, certainly split opinion. Some claimed the racy ad was derogatory towards women, even as they flocked to buy the bra in their millions. Much of the controversy centred on traffic accidents, with some commuters blaming the huge roadside poster for their lack of concentration.

"Barack Obama pleaded with Congress to green-light a $6.18 billion funding request to fight Ebola on Tuesday, appearing at the National Institutes of Health to urge lawmakers to fall in line. The president told scientists, NIH staffers, patients and a global audience that America's strategy to slow the deadly disease's advance was finally bearing fruit – but insisted the 'fight is nowhere close to being over.' 'Every hotspot is an ember that if not contained can become a new fire, so we can't let down our guard even for a minute,' he said. 'And we can't just fight this epidemic. We have to extinguish it.' FIRST CHEMIST: Obama joked with Dr. Nancy Sullivan that he had brushed up on his organic chemistry in preparation for her presentation on vaccine research . FIRST COMIC: The president successfully named a handful of scientific apparatuses used in vaccine labs, and joked that the White House used similar setups to make beer . Ebola remains largely confined to a handful western African nations, and the White House says the U.S. should stop the disease there . His funding request has fallen through the cracks as a congressional lame-duck session winds down and Republicans prepare to take over leadership of the U.S. Senate in January. But the president said 'we can't beat Ebola without more funding. It's a good Christmas present to the American people and to the world.' The White House has been engaged in a strategy to protect the U.S. from the spread of the Ebola virus after it took hold this year in western Africa. The nations of Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea have seen significant concentrations of diagnosed cases, while just a few infected people have made it to the United States. Obama used his photo-op to reassure Americans that even though their attention may have moved to other issues, the public-health fight against Ebola remains an urgent priority in his administration. The president toured portions of the NIH headquarters in Bethesda, Maryland before delivering 25 minutes of remarks. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Dr. Anthony Fauci and cell biologist Dr. Nancy Sullivan escorted him through a second-floor Ebola lab at the NIH Vaccine Research Center. A few minutes later, according to a White House press pool report, the president appeared before assembled cameras and asked, 'So, what have we got here?' A joking Obama told Dr. Sullivan that he had 'brushed up on my organic chem[istry] and I'm ready to go.' 'Sullivan walked through a series of slides on a computer screen and the president asked questions occasionally, though often with his back to the [press] pool and inaudible,' the pool reporter added. SHOW ME THE MONEY: Obama wants more than $6 billion from the lame-duck Congress to fight Ebola around the globe . National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Director Tony Fauci (left) and Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Burwell (2nd left) joined the president for his tour and scientific brush-up . LIBERIA: Health workers in Africa are still engaged in the critical but gruesome work of disinfecting dead bodies as the Ebola epidemic claims dozens of lives every day . The NIH announced last week the initial success of America's first Ebola vaccine trial, a milestone that Obama called 'exciting' – while allowing that science provides 'no guarantees' that a working vaccine will result. The vaccine study involved human 20 volunteers, and resulted in no side effects. But it's unclear if the shots work, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has yet to try them in west Africa. Sullivan has been working on the vaccine concept at NIH for years, and had already demonstrated that it blocks Ebola's effects in research monkeys. After the African outbreak swelled in the spring, the NIH moved quickly to compress its typical five- to ten-year research plan into a period of months. Obama closed by calling NIH 'America's lab.' He rattled off the names of complex technical tools, according to a pool report, 'and joked the White House has a similar apparatus that is used to brew beer.'","President rattled off the names of complex technical tools during a speech at NIH and joked the White House has a similar apparatus to brew beer .

"The advertising campaign for Coca-Cola's new high-end milk has been heavily criticized for apparent 'sexism'. Featuring pictures of naked women dripping in barely-there dresses made of milk, Fairlife is being launched to much fanfare this month in the United States. The photographs, which appear to be working under the logic that 'sex sells', are loosely based on iconic poses from the past, such as Marilyn Monroe's famous skirt rising in The Seven Year Itch. Scroll down for video . Questionable? Twitter has erupted with fury at the allegedly 'sexist' ad campaign for Fairlife milk which is to be launched by Coca-Cola . Designed to appeal to the health lobby, Fairlife will contains 50 percent more protein and half the sugar of milk and accordingly will be priced at twice the normal price. With falling sales in their traditional soda division, Coca-Cola are pinning a lot on Fairlife, especially on the pin-ups they are using to sell it. The cheeky and controversial photographs have slogans such as 'Drink what she's wearing', 'More good, looks good' and 'Better milk looks good on you.' One particular picture has one of the models standing on a set of scales wearing a horrified expression, presumably because she needs to be drinking Fairlife. Attractive: Coca-Cola is hoping that its new high-end milk will help combat its falling sales among sugary soda drinks . Revealing? The advertising campaign for Fairlife - which emulates the famous Marilyn Monroe skirt billow from The Seven Year Itch - has set tongues wagging and tempers rising on social media . Anger: Twitter users took to the social media network to get their anger off their chests and complain about Coca-Cola . 'We’ll charge twice as much for it as the milk we’re used to buying', said Sandy Douglas, Coke’s global chief customer officer, to a launch conference last week. However, the way the women are being represented and used to to sell milk has left many on social media annoyed. One Twitter user, Dan Barker posted, 'In case you missed: ads for Coke's new milk brand show nude women, covered in milk, being weighed. #everydaysexism. Another poster, Rebel Girl UK called the campaign a 'Sexist rubbish (trash) throwback advertising from Coca-Cola for milk...keep the 70s in the 70s!' Aneesh Kamat wrote on the social media site, '@CocaCola's newest brand @fairlife has arguably the worst ad campaign I've seen. Women dressed in milk? #Fail #RespectWomen #advertising. Regardless, there is a lot riding on Fairlife for Coca-Cola. As Americans cut down on unhealthy soft drinks, Coca-Cola has turned to creating a premium type of milk to boost their dwindling profits. 'It's basically the premiumization of milk,' Sandy Douglas, a senior vice president at Coca-Cola's North American operation at the Morgan Stanley Global Consumer Conference last week. Launch: Featuring pictures of naked women dripping in barely-there dresses made of milk, Fairlife is being launched to much fanfare this month in the United States . Moove over Coca-Cola: The advertisements for Fairlife not only depict women in milk dresses that cling closely to their bodies, they advertise the health benefits of the product such as more calcium . The company has had success in advertising healthier beverages with their Simply juice line which has done well despite the fruit juice industry starting to slump. Fruit juices are also packed with sugars and are a major contributor along with soft drinks to childhood obesity. CBS reports that Coca-Cola advertises Simply juices as being healthier, unsweetened, and never frozen. Our ambition there is to create the Simply of milk,' Douglas said of the new product. American shoppers have flocked towards higher protein products like Yogurt and less are buying items with high sugar contents. 'Protein is the fastest-growing segment of the beverage category,' Mike Saint John, president of Coca-Cola North America's Minute Maid business unit, told the Dairy Today. Despite the growing popularity of high protein products, Dairy Today reports that one of every two adults doesn't drink milk at all. Milk sales have also declined by 8 per cent over the last ten years. Coming soon: Fairlife milk will be on shelves starting in late December and will cost twice the price of regular milk because it is supposedly healthier than traditional milk . What Coca-Cola aims to do is advertise how Fairlife is healthier than traditional milk because it's cold-filtered to concentrate protein and remove fat and sugar. Coca-Cola already sells a protein shake called Core Power which goes through the same filtration process. In order to build hype around the new milk, Coca-Cola has developed provocative ads which they launched earlier this year in Minnesota of women wearing dresses made from milk, reports Business Insider. 'Swing into something better,' says one advertisement picturing a woman in a dress made of milk hanging from a swing. 'Milk with flair,' reads another ad picturing a woman in a dress made from milk that resembles an iconic image of Marilyn Monroe in a white dress. Despite the Milk industry being on the decline, Coca-Cola believes that their premium product equipped with a premium price tag will reel in the cash flow. 'Now to be clear, we're going to be investing in the milk business for a while to build the brand so it won't rain money in the early couple of years,' Douglas said at last week's conference. 'But like Simply, when you do it well, it rains money later.'","Social media unimpressed with soda-giants new campaign for premium milk .

Troy Norris was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder, following 13 years of intercepting asylum seeker boats. 'There'd been times where we had to do body recoveries, which was quite difficult and traumatising,' Mr Norris said. 'The people had been in the water for quite a period of time ... they became quite bloated and there's only one way to pull them in and that's to grab them and try and chuck them in the boat. 'Sometimes you'd go to pull these people in the boat and all you'd end up with is a handful of flesh. It'd just strip to the bone.' Norris also told ABC he was callously discharged from the Navy when he showed signs of experiencing trauma. Another Navy officer, referred to as Michael, recollected a time when Operation Resolute followed government suggestions to not to intercept a boat approaching Australian borders which had begun to sink.

"A head chef for P&O Ferries died of a heart attack after he was 'mummified' in clingfilm and plastic sheeting during a sex game with 'two men he met online', a court heard. Alun Williams, 47, was unable to regulate his body temperature after being wrapped in clingfilm and plastic and suffered dehydration which eventually led to a heart attack, a jury at Canterbury Crown Court was told today. The chef, who lived with his girlfriend in Shepherdswell, Kent, had an interest in bondage and mummification and would meet men online for sex, the trial heard. Richard Bowler, 35, (left) and David Connor, 23, both from Canterbury, Kent, (pictured outside court today) are charged with unlawfully killing Alun Williams, who was wrapped in plastic and clingfilm at a flat in Dover . Richard Bowler, 35, and David Connor, 23, both from Canterbury, are charged with unlawfully killing Mr Williams, after he was found dead at the pair's flat in Dover, Kent, on August 20 last year. The charge specifies that wrapping Mr Williams in clingfilm and plastic 'subjected him to bodily harm in the form of dehydration, overheating and stress to his cardiovascular system'. It states that this was the 'substantial cause of his death'. The pair also face an alternative charge of manslaughter by gross negligence. They both deny the charges. Bowler, who has cerebral palsy which affects his co-ordination and movement, wept loudly as prosecutor Ian Hope opened the case and had to be asked by Judge Adele Williams to be quiet. He said Bowler and Connor lived together, with Connor acting as Bowler's 'informal carer'. Shortly after 6am on the day of Mr Williams's death, Connor walked into the taxi rank where his mother worked and said 'Mum, Richard's killed someone', the court was told. He mentioned bondage and a muscle relaxant and told his mother that Mr Williams was dead. Bowler, after making a phone call to his brother and texting his sister-in-law for help, phoned the police at 5.53am and told them he had been involved in a 'kinky sex session' with a friend who was wrapped up and had stopped breathing, the court heard. Mr Williams, 47, was found dead and wrapped in clingfilm at a flat in Dover, Kent, on August 20 last year . Richard Bowler (pictured) and David Connor, both from Canterbury, deny the charges and the trial continues . He was put through to the ambulance service and told them that Mr Williams had taken the drug ketamine. Tests on Mr Williams, who had worked for P&O Ferries for 30 years, later revealed he had taken a cocktail of drugs including the horse tranquiliser ketamine. The court heard that he had lay dead for several hours before the pair realised what had happened. Mr Hope told the court there were many risks to leaving Mr Williams in a room on his own while wrapped up in plastic sheeting and clingfilm after he had taken drugs. He said: 'At the very least they were bound to constantly monitor him which they failed to do and which resulted in his death, unnoticed by both of them for quite some time.' The jury was also played the 999 call made to the police by Bowler shortly before 6am. He is heard telling the call handler: 'It's a bit embarrassing. 'It's my friend, he's called Alun. I have known him for five years. 'I'm gay, he's gay. We had a bit of a kinky sex game and he's stopped breathing.' Connor can be heard in the background as Bowler makes the call. Bowler tells the operator: 'He's on my bed, he's wrapped up in a PVC sheet with tape and that. 'He's got clingfilm wrapped around his body and I have got a text message on my phone stating that's what he likes.' The trial then heard Bowler's call after he was transferred to an ambulance service operator who told him how to carry out CPR. Police officers stand guard at the entrance to the flat where Mr Williams was found dead in August last year . Forensic experts and police officers were called to the flat in Dover last August after Mr Williams had died . Mr Hope said when paramedics arrived they discovered the bed covered in black plastic and Bowler performing CPR on Mr Williams. The prosecutor told the court: 'The clingfilm extended from his ankles to his shoulders and it was obvious he had been dead for some time.' Paramedic Mark MacDougall, who was one of the first people on the scene, said Bowler told him he had last seen Mr Williams alive three hours previously, the jury heard. The court heard that Mr Williams was found wrapped tightly from head to toe in the plastic sheeting and clingfilm, with a space left around his nose and mouth so he could breathe. A hood had been placed over his head, allegedly at Mr Williams' request, and sexual acts involving the three men took place, the court was told. PC Kevin Sturgess arrived at the flat at 6.10am and spoke to Connor who told him that Bowler had regularly indulged in kinky sex and that Mr Williams had been to the flat before, the court was told. He said Mr Williams had arrived, said hello and shook his hand before going to see Bowler, the jury heard. Mr Hope said that Connor told Mr Sturgess he had gone out at midnight and returned to the property at 1am, where he found Bowler crying and shaking. Bowler had told Connor that Mr Williams wanted to be wrapped up in cling film and was not breathing, the jury heard. Mr Sturgess then arrested Connor who told him: 'I haven't done anything. I told you what happened.' Mr Hope said police found drugs including ketamine, cocaine, methamphetamine and amyl nitrate, otherwise known as poppers, in Mr Williams' rucksack. Bowler and Connor deny the charges against them and the trial at Canterbury Crown Court (above) continues . They also found a gas mask and ties in his bag, the court heard. Sex toys, masking tape, duct tape, black plastic sheeting and cling film were also found in the flat, the jury heard. A laptop found in Mr Williams' car showed he had an interest in bondage and mummification, the court heard. A post-mortem examination on Mr Williams' body confirmed that he had died suddenly following body wrapping while under the influence of ketamine and methamphetamine. The jury heard how despite having a female partner, Mr Williams enjoyed meetings 'for the purpose of gay sex'. Bowler said they had known each other for five years and had met for sex after using various gay websites, the jury heard. Text messages between Bowler and Mr Williams sent between the months of June and August last year arranging meetings for sex were also shown to the jury. Mr Williams texted Bowler on the afternoon of August 19 to discuss meeting for sex later on that night where 'wrapping' was mentioned, the court heard. His final text message to Bowler's phone was sent at 11.23pm telling him he was outside of his flat, the trial was told. Bowler and Connor both deny the charges against them. The trial continues.

"It gives the phrase 'sleeping with the fishes' a whole new meaning. An unusual new room has officially opened as part of Africa's first underwater hotel has opened for business. The three floor little piece of luxury is situated 820ft from the little-known island of Pemba, off the mainland of Tanzania and Zanzibar and the room can only be reached by going down a step ladder. Scroll down for video . The bedroom windows look directly into the ocean giving the sense of an underwater theatre . Guests can have their own window on the Indian Ocean at the Manta Resort, and wave hello to divers . Located 13ft below the sea, the unique hideaway is not for the claustrophobic. The top floor is the balcony, perfect for star gazing at night and soaking some rays during the day. The middle floor is where the dining room is, but offers guests the chance to relax and enjoy the sunset. The newly opened ‘Manta Underwater Room’ - 13 feet (four metres) under the India Ocean - allows travellers to observe shoals of fish drifting past during the day, watch squid and octopus at night, and perhaps even spot rarer underwater creatures lurking in the coral which is developing around the base of the room and its anchoring lines. The idyllic room costs £960 ($1,500) a night. You may find it hard to get some shut eye, as the fabulous sea creatures might leave you amazed andintrigued . It’s not the world's first underwater room, although it may be one of the most remote: The Manta Resort is situated on an idyllic island beach on the northern most point of one of East Africa’s finest island sanctuaries. With a population of 300,000 in total, the island has a very low level of tourism despite white coral sand and clear waters. Guests of the Manta Underwater Room sleep in a glass-walled underwater chamber surrounded only by the sea while, above sea level, two additional levels are provided for leisure and recreation. The roof doubles as a sunbathing terrace during the day and a stargazing spot at night, and without any light pollution means would-be astronomers can enjoy exceptional night-time views. The Underwater Manta Room can only be reached by boat and is situated 820ft from the little-known island of Pemba, off the mainland of Tanzania and Zanzibar . The landing deck includes a lounge and bathroom, accessed by ladder. A small group of Swedish and Tanzanian  investors made the underwater room on Pemba possible, and it is now owned by Genberg Art UW Limited. The company says the idea of the underwater room was based on probably the first of its kind, also designed by Mikael Genberg, a Swedish artist and public speaker, which opened in 2000 in Lake Mälaren in Västerås, near Stockholm. Called the Utter Inn, the single room of the hotel lies three metres below the surface of the lake and proved an instant hit. (Genberg is no stranger to creating unusual public spaces for people to stay, having also created the Woodpecker Hotel, where guests can look across the city of Västerås from 13 metres up an old oak tree.) Staying at the underwater hotel would make for a somewhat interesting game of 'I spy'... The special underwater hotel is located off the island of Pemba, which can be reached easily by boat for further exploring . Sub-aquatic tourism is of growing interest in the specialist hotel sector: The Jules Undersea Lodge off Key Largo, Florida, features three underwater rooms, while the Maldives also has a number of underwater ventures. Last year Dubai’s space-age underwater project, the Water Discus hotel, designed by company Deep Ocean Technology was announced and there are more in the pipeline. For now, it’s worth keeping an eye on the Genberg Underwater Hotels Company as it is planning to launch similar rooms around the world.

"Lebanese Army soldiers have arrested a suspected Australian terrorist among a group of ten alleged Syrian jihadis in raids in northern Lebanon on Monday. The Australian, man, about whom little is yet known, was rounded up with six Syrians in northern Lebanese region of Koura, which lies along the Mediterranean sea around 60km from the Syrian border. The Lebanese military rounded up four Syrians in Beirut’s densely-populated neighborhood of Tariq al-Jadideh on suspicion of having links to jihadi, an Army statement said. Crackdown: Lebanese security forces arrest a man in Beirut during a hotel raid following the June suicide bombing on the Beirut to Syria road. The military have now arrested 11 men, including one Australian among a group of suspected Syrian jihadists . Terror suspects: Members of Lebanon's military (pictured in a June raid) have arrested 11 men in northern Lebanon including one Australian in an ongoing clampdown on the clandestine entry of terrorists . Australian suspect: An Australioan man suspected by Lebanese security forces of being a jihadist has been arrested in Lebanon's northern district of Koura, just 60km south of the Syrian border . 'An Army force raided early morning  a certain location in Al-Tariq al-Jadideh in Beirut during which it arrested four Syrian nationals, on suspicion of having links to terrorist groups and for residing in Lebanon without legal papers,' the statement said. It added that six Lebanese and an Australian national were also detained Monday in the district of Koura, in north Lebanon, on suspicion of terror links. Around 150 Australians and dual nationals are estimated to be fighting overseas, many of them in Syria, making Australia the highest foreign per-capita contributor to the conflicts. In raids over the  months following the June crackdown (pictured), several suspects have been detained following search and seizure warrants filed by Interpol or by Syrian authorities . The 11 arrests in northern Lebanon  were part of a security dragnet targeting wanted militants. Security sources told The Daily Star that dozens of Syrians were being rounded up regularly as part of security measures aimed at clamping down on terror suspects and their clandestine entry into Lebanon. Tightened security measures have been in order since June, when a suicide bomber killed at least one person at an army checkpoint on the road from Beirut to the Syrian capital, Damascus. Lebanese security forces were deployed  in raids on two Beirut hotels, and arrested 15 people. In raids over the last few months, several suspects have been detained following search and seizure warrants filed by Interpol or by Syrian authorities, in line with a treaty for the exchange of criminals signed between Lebanon and Syria, the sources said. Some of the detainees were illegal immigrants, but others were wanted in Syria and had escaped into Lebanon. Lebanese authorities will try to establish  whether or not sending the detainees back to Syria would put their lives in danger. It is unclear whether the Australian arrested in Lebanon with four Syrians had  entered the country from Syria. A Sydney court hearing last week of alleged Australian jihadi recruiter, Hamdi Alqudsi, revealed at least six men had taken gone to fight with extremist forces in Syria, taking a route from the north via the Turkish capital, Istanbul.","Lebanese soldiers have arrested one Australia suspected terrorist .

"Shocking exams results from a New Jersey school district have revealed that only 19 out of 600 students could get into college. Just over 3 per cent of pupils from Paterson were deemed 'college ready' based on their SAT scores, meaning they achieved at least 1,500 out of 2,400 points. The average score obtained by a student in the area was just 1,200. It is a decrease on the 26 (4.2 per cent) who reached the benchmark last year. Shocking: Exam results from the Paterson School District in New Jersey (headquarters pictured) revealed that only 19 out of 600 students scored enough to get into college . Despite the worrying results, some education officials have insisted they are not concerned and have criticized exam boards for fielding questions that hurt minorities and female students. However others agreed that there was a problem and that the administration may have been 'hiding something'. Corey Teague, a school board member, told the Paterson Press suggest optimistic estimates of improved student scores may be inaccurate. 'That's a sign that they're hiding something,' he said. 'They like to brag that the scores are up when they're not.' Terry Corall, a spokeswoman for the district, said the numbers are 'flat not down', in reference to last year's scores. She said the difference in the total number of students who reached college-ready score was 'not much different from past years.' 'More importantly, this chart was referring to SAT's being used as a college-readiness benchmark,' Corallo added. 'But as we have discussed, there are many factors that play a part in college readiness.' Just over 3 per cent of pupils from Paterson were deemed 'college ready' based on their SAT scores, meaning they achieved at least 1,500 out of 2,400 points . Rosie Grant, director of the Paterson Education Fund, a nonprofit advocacy group, told the paper: 'We certainly want our students to be college-ready... but I’m not too alarmed because these numbers are based on the SATs.

"The 49-year-old man who was shot dead by police after firing about 200 rounds in downtown Austin and attempted to burn the Mexican Consulate was a 'homegrown, American extremist'. Larry McQuilliams was a 'terrorist' who harbored extremist right-wing views, and appeared to be planning a broader attack against churches and government facilities, Austin police have said. Convicted bank robber McQuilliams went on a rampage in Austin in the early hours of Friday, carrying  multiple weapons and hundreds of rounds of ammunition. Scroll down for video . 'Terrorist': Larry McQuilliams, 49, was shot dead by police after firing about 200 rounds and attempting arson on the Mexican Consulate in downtown Austin around 2.30am Friday . McQuilliams, started his attack on the Mexican Consulate building and a federal courthouse shortly after 2.20am. After firing about 200 rounds, he was killed by a single shot to the chest from a police officer as he shot at police headquarters. Written in marker on his chest were the words, 'Let me die,' Austin Police Chief Art Acevedo said. When police searched his rented van they found books associated with a right-wing Christian sect known as the Phineas Priesthood, which holds extremist, anti-Semitic and racist views. Police found a copy of 'Vigilantes of Christendom,' a book describes the Phineas Priesthood as Christian guerrillas who avenge Judeo-Christian traitors. When police searched McQuilliams van they found evidence that he was associated with the Phineas Priesthood, a right-wing Christian sect which holds extremist, anti-Semitic and racist views . Inside the book was a handwritten note that referred to McQuilliams as a 'priest in the fight against anti-God people,' Acevedo said. Officers who searched his home found a map of 34 downtown buildings that likely were potential targets of further attacks, including two churches. Investigators said McQuilliams left no note describing a specific motive or why he picked his targets. Christopher Combs, FBI special agent in charge of the San Antonio division, which includes Austin, also noted that some people who knew McQuilliams told investigators he'd been upset that he couldn't find a job and believed immigrants were given more services than he was. City and federal investigators say they are confident McQuilliams acted alone. Further attacks: When Austin police searched his home, they found a map of 34 buildings in downtown Austin that likely were potential targets of further attacks, including two churches . 'No one helped him. There's not a larger conspiracy at all,' said Combs. 'The one mistake he made was he came to the Austin police station and we were able to take him out pretty quickly,' Acevedo said, describing McQuilliams as a 'homegrown, American extremist' and 'terrorist.' McQuilliams had rented a van that was parked outside the police station and was loaded with ammunition and propone fuel canisters typically used for camping. McQuilliams tried to use fireworks with the canisters to make crude but ineffective bombs and used some at the Mexican Consulate, causing a fire that was quickly extinguished. McQuilliams had served about seven years in federal prison for bank robbery and was released in 2000. As a convicted felon, he could not legally possess the firearms he used in his attack. Acevedo said investigators are still trying to determine how he got them.","Larry McQuilliams tried to burn down Mexican Consulate in Austin, Texas .

"The myth of the 'mean girl' has finally been debunked, with new research proving that it is boys who are more likely to spread malicious rumors, be manipulative and reject or exclude others at school. According to researchers from the University of Georgia, who asked 620 randomly-selected students to complete an annual survey every year between the ages of 11 and 18, it is young boys who are more likely to engage in these behaviors – categorized as ‘relational aggression’ – and who are more likely to be the victims of such abuse. Of the children surveyed, a large majority, both boys and girls, claimed that it was male students, in every grade, from six through 12, who often engaged in socially aggressive behavior, rather than the females. Nasty: New research shows that it is boys who are more likely to spread malicious rumors, be manipulative and reject or exclude others at school . However, the analysis also showed that the number of boys who felt victimized by their fellow classmates significantly decreased over the seven-year period, whereas the number of girls who were victims of moderate to high degrees of bullying remained more of less the same during that time. Professor Pamela Orpinas, who led the study, said: 'Overall, we found relational aggression to be a very common behavior.' She added that 96per cent of the students surveyed had passed a rumor or made a nasty comment about someone over the course of the study. Experiences of some form of victimization were found to be universal as well, with over 90per cent of the students reporting that they had been victims of social aggression at least once, according to the report, which was published in the journal Aggressive Behavior. Queen bees: The idea that girls are more likely to be socially aggressive is perpetuated by stereotypes found in pop culture, for example the 2004 movie Mean Girls (pictured) Dr Orpinas added: 'We have books, websites and conferences aimed at stopping girls from being aggressive, as well as a lot of qualitative research on why girls are relationally aggressive. 'But oddly enough, we don’t have enough research on why boys would be relationally aggressive because people have assumed it’s a girl behavior.' She explained that much more research is necessary to understand why girls are more likely than boys to be targets of aggression or to perceive certain acts as aggressive. 'While the study may call for more scholarship on ""mean boys"" and why they behave the way they do, the findings ultimately emphasize a need to include boys and girls equally in programs aimed at reducing relational aggression,' she said. 'In the end, I think we need to ask how we can focus on increasing the positive interactions among kids rather than the negative ones, because the kids that students admire are often the ones who are fun and positive about others.'",A new study at the University of Georgia found that boys aged 11-18 were more likely than girls to spread rumors and exclude other children .
"A single market town in the foothills of the Pennines has taken more asylum seekers than the whole of South East England, it has been revealed. Extraordinary figures show Rochdale, which rose to prominence with its textile mills during the Industrial Revolution, houses 680 refugees – one in 41 of all those in Britain. Yet the entire south-east region, which covers eight counties plus the Isle of Wight and is amongst the most affluent in the country, has received just 441 asylum seekers. Scroll down for video . The market town of Rochdale has taken more asylum seekers than the whole of the South East region . Rochdale is a market town in Greater Manchester with a population of just over 200,000. It has a much larger proportion of people from a Pakistani background than the rest of the country. Around 10 per cent of the town is Pakistani British, according to the latest census. The town is also poorer, with more unemployment and lower house prices than the UK average. Around 10 per cent of population is out of work – compared to just 6 per cent nationally. More than 5,000 families in Rochdale have children where neither parent is in work. The average house price in the town is just over £120,000 – less than half the £270,000 across the UK. In West Oxfordshire, the local authority which covers Prime Minister David Cameron’s Witney constituency, has failed to take a single person, while Maidenhead, where Home Secretary Theresa May is the MP, has just one. Now MPs have vowed to raise the issue with the Home Office amid concerns that some towns and cities across Britain have been handed an ‘unfair’ burden. They say the distribution of asylum seekers is a ‘scandal’ that has put disproportionate strain on schools, health services, housing and other infrastructure in their constituencies. Rochdale’s Labour MP Simon Danczuk – who has repeatedly urged party leader Ed Miliband to face up to the pressures of immigration faced by communities across the UK – has said in the past his seat, population 211,000, has become a ‘magnet for the dispossessed’. Mr Danczuk said: ‘I think we can be proud as a country that we offer asylum to people who need it, but we need to make sure the burden is spread fairly across the country. We need to make sure that the system is fair. ‘The system at the moment is a shambles and ministers need to explain why David Cameron’s constituency takes no asylum seekers and a wildly disproportionate number are placed in Rochdale. ‘This is bad policy and runs the risk of not only putting extra strain on community relations but also putting significant pressure on services that are already struggling due to Government cuts.’ Rochdale is home to Gillian Duffy, who famously confronted Gordon Brown during the 2010 election campaign over the numbers of immigrants in the town . Rochdale is home to Gillian Duffy, who famously confronted Gordon Brown during the 2010 election campaign over the numbers of immigrants in the town. The Labour leader later described her as a 'bigoted woman'. Labour MP Paul Flynn, who represents Newport, in south Wales, said the former coal and steel city had 426 asylum seekers. He said: ‘Many asylum seekers have settled very well and become part of Newport, and the city has been very hospitable. But the differences in the number being sent to different parts of the country is so amazing as to be scandalous. ‘There are serious problems such as the strain on health and education services and problems with people integrating. These tensions are not the fault of the asylum seekers, but the Home Office for housing them disproportionately. Rochdale MP Simon Danczuk said the town should be proud of the number of people it offers asylum to but stressed the must be 'spread fairly across the country' ‘We have been carrying more than our fair share.’ Mr Flynn is also angry that the Home Office ‘dumped’ a notorious London gang leader in Newport on immigration bail when he had no links to the city. Home Office figures show there were 27,815 asylum seekers living in Britain at the end of September. Many are fleeing war, humanitarian disasters or political and religious persecution in other parts of the world. But large numbers turn out to be economic migrants, who arrive in the UK to look for well-paid work compared to their home countries, then tried to claim asylum to win the right to stay here. London – which is not included in figures for the South East – had 2,692 asylum seekers, ranging from 377 in deprived Newham, east London, to to just eight in leafy Richmond-upon-Thames in south-west London. Islington, which covers the constituency of ex-Labour frontbencher Emily Thornberry, sacked for apparently sneering at a house draped with St George’s Cross flags and with a white van parked in front, took 30 refugees. In the North West, there were 6,298 asylum seekers, including 1,418 in Liverpool and 794 in Manchester. The West Midlands had 4,105 asylum seekers, including 1,370 in Birmingham. Glasgow alone had 2,625, Cardiff 922 and Middleborough 776, with Stockton-on-Tees, just down the road in Teesside, taking in 666. But in the South East, well-heeled Wokingham, Winchester, Chichester and Mole Valley are among those local authorities without a single asylum seeker. Sources in Whitehall suggested the high prices of rented property in the South East and lack of available homes in rural areas meant it was more cost-effective to place asylum seekers outside the region. A Home Office spokesman said: ‘The United Kingdom has a long and proud history of offering sanctuary to those who genuinely need it. ‘Asylum seekers are housed according to their individual needs and where there is available and appropriate accommodation. Agreements between national government and local authorities are voluntary and have been in place since 2000. ‘We review this regularly, working closely with local authorities to ensure the system is fair for asylum seekers and for tax payers across the country.’","Market town in the foothills of the Pennines houses 680 refugees .

"A 28-year-old mother could spend the rest of her life in prison for causing a car crash that killed her 4-year-old daughter last year. The trial for Starr Kiogima -McGill started Monday in Charlotte, Michigan and she faces charges of second-degree murder and drunk driving causing death. In opening statements, prosecutors argued that the Grand Ledge, Michigan woman recklessly caused her daughter Natalie Ann-Marie McGill's death by driving drunk and high on painkillers. Kiogima-McGill's defense did not make opening statements yesterday, but have previously said that the crash was an accident caused when the mother got distracted trying to hand a bag of candy to her daughter sitting in the back seat. Tragic crash: Starr Kiogima-McGill (left) is on trial for the 2013 car crash that killed her 4-year-old daughter Natalie (right) If convicted of second-degree murder, Kiogima-McGill could spend the rest of her life in prison. The drunk driving causing death charge carries a maximum 15-year sentence. 'This is a case about Natalie McGill, a 4-year-old girl who lost her life,' Eaton County Assistant Prosecutor Chris Anderson told the jury on Monday. 'This is a case about alcohol, and about Natalie's mother — the defendant — and her consumption of alcohol ... It's about controlled substances, and the defendant's choice to consume controlled substances.' Anderson revealed that Kiogima-McGill's blood-alcohol content was three times the legal limit when she lost control of her 1997 red Ford Expedition around 1:37pm on September 11, 2013, causing it to strike another vehicle and roll several times before coming to a rest in the middle of a median on I-96. 'Drunk and high': In opening statements on Monday, prosecutors said Kiogima-McGill had three times the legal amount of alcohol in her system at the time of the September 11, 2013 crash . Just an accident: Kiogima-McGill's defense did not give opening statements on Monday, but have previously argued that the crash was an accident caused when the mother got distracted . Traces of the painkiller Oxycontin and anti-anxiety pill Lorazepam were also found in the suspect's system. Evidence at the scene  suggested that Kiogima-McGill didn't secure her daughter's car seat properly, if at all. On Monday, a couple who was hit by Kiogima-McGill in the accident and the first police officer to arrive on the scene testified about what they saw the day of the crash. Eaton County Sheriff's Deputy Robert Block said he didn't smell alcohol on Kiogima-McGill when he first encountered her on the scene, but said he wasn't looking for signs of intoxication at the time. Kiogima-McGill was also critically injured in the crash and taken to a local hospital for treatment. Kiogima-McGill's sister Misty shared a story on the woman's trial on Facebook yesterday, writing: 'That's my sister.. I know her [first] hand. Yes, she made a terrible mistake and it resulted in the life of her daughter Natalie Ann Marie McGill. She is a caring, loving, wonderful mother, wife, daughter, sister, etc. She lost apart of her September 11, 2013. 'Natalie was her everything along with her other daughters. And she lost a part of her that day. Never will be the same and that's punishment enough. 'She has [three] other daughters [who] need their mother. Just don't judge a book by it's cover. Free my baby sister. She suffered enough, never will be the same.. But will remain the caring kindhearted wonderful person she is.'","Starr Kiogima-McGill is on trial for causing the crash that led to her 4-year-old daughter Natalie's death on September 11, 2013 .

"A schoolboy hanged himself in woods near his school after becoming a big fan of heavy metal music, an inquest heard today. James Lock, 15, was found dead with his iPod earphones still in his ears playing the loud music. His parents had noticed his new found love of 'hardcore' rock music in the year before his death - and had discovered 'dark' sketches he had done in his room. James Lock (pictured) left home to go to school as usual but never turned up for lessons, he was  found hanged just an hour later in woodlands next to the school . But James, a good student who dreamed of becoming a pilot, had also drawn 'disturbing pictures' of people with a noose around their neck which were only found after his death. The inquest heard that his mother Sarah, 42, had watched the teenager leave for school on April 10 with his earphones plugged in 'just like any ordinary day'. But an hour later he was found by a university student who was walking through Hendrefoilan Woods in Skettya near Olchfa Comprehensive School in Swansea, South Wales, where James was a pupil. Paramedics arrived at 9.35am to find the music still playing in his ears but he was pronounced dead at the scene. James was found by a university student with the music of a heavy metal band  still playing in his ears . Flowers, messages and school uniform ties were left as tributes on the trees outside Olchfa Comprehensive school on Gower Road in the Sketty area of Swansea, where the body of the 15-year old was discovered . The inquest heard James had recently become a fan of the masked rockers known for their disturbing lyrics and dark imagery . James had recently become a fan of the masked rockers known for their disturbing lyrics and dark imagery - with songs linked to violent crime. His heartbroken parents said they had known about their son's  interest in thrash metal and that he had sketched 'dark drawings' but they did not think it reflected his feelings. His mother Sarah told police: 'James enjoyed listening to music. He had liked laid back music but recently he had got into darker and harder metal like Slipknot and had dark drawings in his bedroom. 'He loved his iPod and would often have earphones in.' She said her son had a 'volatile personality and was quick tempered' and would often act without thinking of the consequences of his actions. His father Andrew Lock said James would often have drawings on his arms depicting images such as 'falling angels'. He said: 'In recent years he had been heavily into hardcore rock. We put the dark drawings down to the music scene he was into and didn't put them down to the way he was feeling.' Divorcee Mr Lock continued: 'James had so much to look forward to in life and so many people who loved him and we feel devastated. We cannot think why he would take his own life.' James' mother Sarah, 42, said her son had a 'volatile personality and was quick tempered' and would often act without thinking of the consequences of his actions . The inquest heard James had been an active pupil who dreamed of becoming a pilot before becoming 'heavily interested' in the thrash metal heroes Slipknot. Detective Constable Laura O'Sullivan told the inquest: 'James starred in the school productions of Joseph and Greece. 'He had ambitions to join the forces and become an RAF pilot. He joined the Sea Cadets and took great pride in his uniform. 'He had won awards for best dress, drill team and won a gold at the national kayak championships.' He was found in the woods near his school, Olchfa Comprehensive (pictured) in Gower Road, Swansea . Tributes to the schoolboy were left attached to trees in Hendrefoilan Woods, in Sketty, last April after his death . Coroner Colin Phillips recorded a narrative verdict and said he could not be sure James intended to end his own life . The inquest heard there was no evidence of bullying of James, no drugs or alcohol involved. Coroner Colin Phillips recorded a narrative verdict and said he could not be sure James intended to end his own life. Mr Phillips said: 'Drawings and images were found and these were of a dark nature but I think these reflected his music interests and do not show any way he was feeling. 'James was only 15 years old and I am not convinced he understood the finality of his actions. 'He was found with his earphones in playing music and we have heard his mother say he would often act without thinking about the consequences of his actions. 'This is a terrible tragic death of a young man who had so much to offer.' An earlier version of this story stated that James Lock was listening to Slipknot at the time of his death. We are happy to clarify that this was not the case.","James Lock, 15, was found dead in woodland near his school in Swansea .

"Israel's prime minister has fired two senior ministers following their outspoken criticism of his leadership, setting the stage for the dissolution of parliament and new elections two years ahead of schedule. Benjamin Netanyahu's office said today he had ordered the dismissal of Finance Minister Yair Lapid and Justice Minister Tzipi Livni. The coalition government has been divided over key issues in recent weeks, and Lapid and Livni have emerged as fierce critics of the prime minister. He said: 'In past weeks, including the past day, ministers Lapid and Livni have harshly attacked the government that I head. I will no longer tolerate an opposition inside the goverment.' Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu (pictured) says he will no longer tolerate 'opposition' within his government after several ministers voiced concern about his policy to enshrine Israel's status as a Jewish state . Ministers Yair Lapid (left) and Tzipi Livni (right) have been sacked from Israel's Cabinet by Netanyahu following the pair's outspoken opposition to his far-right policies . With his coalition in tatters, Netanyahu is expected to order new elections, more than two years ahead of schedule. Two members of the centrist Yesh Atid party - currently a member of Netanyahu's coalition - warned the vote would come at a particularly difficult time. Israeli media said the most likely date for any early election would be sometime in March. The late Monday meeting between Netanyahu and Yesh Atid's leader Lapid followed weeks of sparring between the sides over budget provisions, including an increase for the Ministry of Defense, and Yesh Atid's opposition to the current version of a contentious bill that would enshrine Israel's status as a Jewish state. Netanyahu has 'decided to take Israel to unnecessary elections last night,' Lapid told an economic conference today, adding that despite Israel's 50-day war with Hamas militants over the summer, its problems with a highly militarized Gaza Strip still remain. Lapid has also said he believes that Netanyahu has veered too far to the right by pushing Jewish settlement in east Jerusalem and the West Bank, and failing to advance the peace process with the Palestinians. 'Netanyahu has chosen to go to elections when the situation is particularly difficult,' said Yesh Atid's Yaacov Peri, the science minister. 'There is a crisis with the United States and the condition of the middle class is deteriorating.' Tensions between Israel and Palestine have volatile following the 50-day war over the summer. Here a Palestinian boy shields himself from the flames of a burning tyre . Two men climb a building during clashes with Israeli soldiers in the West Bank city of Hebron . Flashes of violence have broken out in Jerusalem (pictured) following the killing of four people at a synagogue by axe-wielding fanatics . However, Netanyahu can still fill out the remainder of his two-year term even without the support of Yesh Atid, by bringing ultra-orthodox parties into his government. But those parties have so far shown no willingness to join him, apparently preferring the alternative of an early poll. Chairman Danny Danon of Netanyahu's Likud party blamed 'the amateurish antics of Yair Lapid' for 'dragging Israel to an unnecessary, and expensive, early election.' 'After the Likud is victorious at the ballot box, we must be sure not to repeat mistakes of the past and form the next coalition government with loyal and like-minded parties that are interested in serving as true partners in leading our great country,' he said. That suggests a far-right coalition, with a major emphasis on Jewish settlement and Jewish-oriented legislation.

"Royal couple: Prince Roy and Princess Joan Bates at Sealand in 2001 . A retired army major who built his own nation on a former anti-aircraft tower in the North Sea has died at the age of 91. Roy Bates moved his family to the Roughs Tower island fort after he was prosecuted under Marine Broadcasting Offences Act for his part in the pirate radio movement - which inspired the Richard Curtis movie The Boat That Rocked. Major Bates declared the fort independent from the UK and renamed it Sealand on his wife Joan's birthday, September 2, 1967, and bestowed her the title of 'princess'. Sealand has its own stamps, passports and currency. The Sealand Dollar has a fixed exchange rate of one U.S. dollar - and an image of Princess Joan on the coin. The English-speaking country has . its own red, white and black flag, and a national motto of E Mare . Libertas, or 'From the Sea, Freedom'. The fort, with an area of just 550 sq . metres, was initially built by Britain during the Second World War to . guard approaches to the Thames Estuary. Major Bates passed away on Tuesday at a care home in Leigh-on-Sea, Essex, after a long battle with Alzheimer's. His wife Joan is now expected to take over the rule of Sealand. Damaged: Sealand pictured in 2006 after it was ravaged by fire . The nation has a colourful history and has been invaded once - by rival pirate DJs - and even survived a coup attempt by German businessmen. Before Mr Bates claimed the fort, he set up Radio Essex on the nearby Knock John fortified tower in the North Sea. It was Britain's first 24-hour pirate station but was swiftly closed down by the government. Following legal advice, Bates bought HM Fort Roughs, another derelict . artillery installation, and declared independence from Britain. But while he had outsmarted the British government, there was still trouble ahead for Mr Bates, not least of which was an attempted invasion by rival pirate DJs from Radio Caroline. Independent: The fortified tower in the North Sea, which Mr Bates renamed Sealand . It's a small world: Roy Bates made this platform his own country . When they attempted to take the platform, Mr Bates and his crew fought them off using Molotov cocktails and warning shots. A year later, when Royal Maritime . auxiliary vessel Golden Eye passed close by, he fired three warning . shots across her bow, prompting the ship to turn back. Bates was . summonsed to appear before a judge in Essex but was ruled to have acted . outside of British jurisdiction. In 1978, a German businessman who had been dealing with Mr Bates flew to Sealand and staged a coup while the retired Army major and his family were ashore following an argument over money. Within days Mr Bates retook Sealand in a dawn raid, having rappelled from a helicopter with his son Michael, armed with a rifle and wearing combat fatigues. An obituary to Mr Bates on the Sealand website reads: 'Roy was born to be an adventurer' and tributes said he was a 'pioneer'. Kevin Klerks wrote: 'Prince Roy of Sealand, the government and the People of Sealand. 'He was a pioneer in the . micronational community, his dedication and commitment to an idea . inspired hundreds in the boundless pursuit for a better world. 'His passing will be remembered and his legacy honoured.' Dynasty: The son of Major Bates, Michael (foreground), on Sealand with his wife Lorraine (in red), daughter Charlotte and Sealand subjects .

And Geoff Mills wrote: 'So sorry for your loss, my thoughts and prayers are with you all at this time. RIP Roy Bates.' Major Bates was born to Harry and . Lilyan Bates in 1921 and joined the international brigade at the age of . 15, fighting in the Spanish civil war. He then served in Africa, Italy, Iraq . and Syria, in WWII and was once taken prisoner, and suffered horrific . wounds after a grenade exploded near his face, . After the war his wounds healed and . he ran various businesses before getting involved with pirate radio and . then founding Sealand.

Symbol: Sealand has its own red, white and black flag and a national motto of E Mare Libertas, or 'From the Sea, Freedom' Glamorous: The late Roy Bates made his wife Princess Joan of Sealand . In a 1980s television interview, Mr Bates declared: 'I might die young or I might die old, but I will never die of boredom.' The island, which is seven-and-a-half . miles off Felixstowe in the North Sea, is not currently officially . recognised by any sovereign state. However, the WikiLeaks organisation last week suggested it was considering setting itself up on the island nation.

"Last weekend one of the nation's largest and most popular music festivals was held, with more than 81,000 people in attendance over the two days. Of those thousands attending Stereosonic at the Sydney Showgrounds, 830 were stopped by police, taken into a booth, stripped down and searched for drugs by officers. Danny, 27, was one of those people. Except he had no drugs on him, is not a drug taker, and had not come into contact with any illegal substances. This comes as new research revealed that thousands of innocent Australians are subjected to humiliating strip searches in similar situations every year, while 64 percent of sniffer dog detections are incorrect. Danny (not pictured) told Daily Mail Australia how he was detected by a sniffer dog and strip searched at Stereosonic festival on Saturday . 'A sniffer dog sat down next to me and they took me off into a little booth,' Danny said, referring to the way dog are trained to sit when they detect the scent of drugs on a person. 'I had to take off my pants, shirt, shoes, everything,' Danny - who did not wish for his surname to be published - told Daily Mail Australia. 'It was violating... It was very confronting. 'I felt ostracised and like there was something wrong with me, and told I had something on me when I didn't,' Danny said. Initially the Sydney man was asked to handed over his identification and wallet - which officers spent a number of minutes 'scrambling' through. Then he was taken into a booth which he estimated to measure about 5 metres square and forced to remove all his clothes. 'They go through everything you have on you, your clothes, move to your shoes and bang them on the desk to make sure nothing falls out.' The 27-year-old (not pictured) was not carrying any drugs, and a scent had been incorrectly detected on him by a sniffer dog . 'I was just standing there with no clothes on while there's two big police officers going through everything.' 'They were continuously asking me the same questions over and over again, and quite forcibly. '(They asked) ""Do you take drugs?"" ""Do your friends take drugs?"" ""Were you taking drugs yesterday?"",' Danny said. The 27-year-old was also forced to, while naked, hold his genitals and bend over so police could be sure wasn't concealing anything. Although at no time during the search did police touch the 27-year-old,  he said the 10 minute long ordeal was very uncomfortable, especially as he is not a drug user and maintained he had never come into contact with anything of the sort. 'I was quite calm because I didn't have anything on me, (but) it was violating, quite an uncomfortable experience,' said Danny. While he acknowledged the police were doing their job, his issue was with the 'confronting and intimidating' way officers carried out the search and 'assumed I was guilty', which he was not. Over 830 of the 81,000 people who attended the festival were searched for illicit substances . The Sydney man also condemned the use of sniffer dogs saying he thinks they're both unnecessary and inaccurate, and do more harm than good. 'I'm not a fan of it... I had a pretty low opinion of it in the first place... 75 percent of the time or more they pick up people who don't have anything on them,' Danny claimed. 'It's never going to stop people from taking drugs, it might just force them to take them before the festivals. It's dangerous.' This comes as Fairfax Media revealed invasive strip and cavity searches by police have increased by nearly a third over the past five years. Data obtained by the media group also showed than at least 10,000 people per year are wrongly subjected to these humiliating searches, where they're forced to strip down a bend over to prove they have nothing to hide. Further to this, sniffer dogs incorrectly identify people to be carrying drugs when they're 64 percent of the time. 'It's kind of funny they've got one dog to pick up a scent from an area full of thousands of people,' Danny said. Over all 220 people were charged with drug offences over the two day Stereosonic festival, and police said they were 'disappointed' with the high number of arrests. A 21-year-old was found collapsed and was rushed to hospital not breathing, while another 12 also attended emergency rooms for mostly drug-related illnesses.","More than 800 people were searched for drugs at Stereosonic music festival at the weekend .

"A West Virginia gunman who murdered four before people before killing himself on Monday seems to have targeted individuals he felt had betrayed him. Jody Lee Hunt, 39, of Westover, killed Doug Brady, Sharon Berkshire, Michael Frum and Jody Taylor on Monday morning before being found dead himself that evening in a 2011 Ford F-150 parked in the middle of a clearing. Now it is being revealed that Brady was a rival business owner, Berkshire was his ex-girlfriend, and that Frum and Taylor had both had relationships with Berkshire. What's more, Taylor is Hunt's cousin. Scroll down for video . Tragedy: Jody Lee Hunt (left) killed four people on Monday, including Doug Brady (right), the owner of a rival towing company . Victim: Hunt's second victim was his ex-girlfriend Sharon Berkshire (above) who he had been in contact with as recently as last week . Lovers: The last two victims were Jody Taylor (left) and Michael Frum (right) who had both had relationships with Berkshire . It all began on Monday morning when Hunt drove to Doug's Towing in Westover between 9 and 10am and shot 45-year-old Brady twice in the head while he was working on a vehicle. Hunt had been complaining at county meetings over the past few months that Brady had been getting tow jobs illegally according to Monongalia County commissioner Tom Bloom. From there he drove to a home in Cheat Lake where he shot dead both 39-year-old ex-girlfriend Berkshire and her current lover, 28-year-old Frum. Frum had reportedly been taunting Hunt with text messages about his relationship with Berkshire. Berkshire had previously filed two orders of protection against Hunt, once in 2013 and once last month, and also filed a domestic violence case against him last month. Both orders of protection had been dropped shortly after they were filed. Hunt had been in contact with Berkshire as recently as last week, writing on her Facebook page on Thanksgiving, 'Love doesn’t judge excepts [sic] you as you are. Missing u!' Tragic end: Berkshire had previously taken out two orders of protection against Hunt and filed a domestic violence case against him last month . Murder-suicide: After killing the four victims, Hunt shoot himself in the head . His last victim was also a former lover of Berkshire, and his cousin, 43-year-old Taylor, who also used to be a co-owner of Hunt's towing business, J&J Towing. Hunt shot him point blank in Taylor's front yard as Taylor's mother, his aunt, looked on from the doorway of their home. 'I heard a shot. Three of them went off until I could get to the door. I said ""Jody, you okay Jody?”' Cassandra Taylor told WTAE. 'And I said ""Sir, what are you doing?"" And he finished shooting and he took off in his truck. Didn’t look up at me or nothing.' She also said that though there was bad blood between the two men, she was shocked by what happened. 'He had a grudge against my son, and my son had a grudge against him. Jody Hunt had to use a gun, he couldn’t come and talk like he should’ve.' Discovered: Hunt was found in a black Ford truck (above) dead of a self-inflicted gunshot wound . Hunt took to his Facebook on Monday in what seemed to be an attempt to explain his actions. In his first post he wrote; 'My actions were not right nor were the actions of those who tried to tear me down and take from me. This was not the plan but a struggle to see that those who strives to hurt me received their fair pay of hurt like I received...You will not hurt me any more. You will not destroy my soul and heart as you tried so hard to do.' He later wrote another post that said; 'I hope that everyone takes the words I love you seriously. Be honest with the one you are with. No need for a game. You either want them or u don't. Just tell them no need to lead there heart on. I'm so sorry for my actions today and the lives I've effected. I'm so tired of the wrong doers getting by with all of it. No need for games. Life is short. Love the one you are with.' According to court records, Hunt had previously been charged with abduction and illegal use of a firearm in 1999.","Jody Lee Hunt murdered four people on Monday before killing himself .

"A golf fan in Rory McIlroy's home town raised the European flag to celebrate victory in the Ryder Cup - only for a confused neighbour to think it was 'Arabic' and call police. The homeowner in Hollywood, near Belfast, was stunned on Sunday when he had a knock on the door from officers. They quickly discovered the 12 gold stars on a blue background were simply those of the EU flag, a well-known emblem which has been a familiar sight across the continent for more than 50 years. False flag: The EU colours were raised outside this house in Hollywood, County Down, to celebrate Europe's victory in the Ryder Cup - but an offended neighbour called police thinking it was an Arabic emblem . Victory! Europe including Rory McIlroy (right), who is from Hollywood, retained the Ryder Cup on Sunday . The flag's flabbergasted owner asked not to be identified, but said he would take the symbol down to 'keep the peace'. He posted on Facebook: 'Right in shock here. Had a Ryder Cup party yesterday and just had the police round… as apparently it’s caused offence. 'Apparently person who complained thought it was an Arabic flag.' Alliance Party councillor Andrew Muir told the BBC: 'In some ways you couldn't make it up. 'It's rather depressing that we would be focused upon flags. 'People are entitled to fly whatever legal flag they want from their house and in Northern Ireland we need to be able to celebrate our success and the European flag is an open, inclusive symbol of Europe coming together.' Wrong message: The homeowner was a fan of golf and had been holding a party to watch the tournament . Symbol: The European flag was designed more than 50 years ago and is a common sight across the continent . Team Europe triumphed over America in Gleneagles on Sunday for the eighth time in ten tours, retaining the Ryder Cup. McIlroy played a leading role in the victory and his hometown in County Down did not forget his contribution - stringing up banners and posters and even putting his name on the town sign. A spokesman for the Police Service of Northern Ireland confirmed officers had been to the house. The spokesman added: 'Police in Holywood attended an address in the Woodlands area yesterday following the report from a member of the public that a flag they believed to be offensive had been erected. 'Police attended and no offence was detected.' There was tension last month on a council estate in Poplar, east London, when a black flag with Arabic writing resembling that of Islamic extremists was flown only to be torn down by an angry nun. Flags also have a history of controversy in Northern Ireland. There were street protests in 2012 after Belfast City Council voted to restrict the flying of the Union flag from the city hall to 18 days a year.","Police were called to house in golf star's town of Hollywood near Belfast .

"An abusive husband murdered his wife just weeks after being released on bail for violently attacking her, despite her repeated calls to police to warn she was in danger. Madina Landsberg, 31, had reported her 34-year-old husband Dexter to Hertfordshire police several times in the months before she died. In April, Landsberg was arrested for beating up his wife and smashing her mobile phone in a violent rage. He had also been cautioned in 2012 for assaulting his wife. Madina Landsberg, 31, was murdered by her abusive husband Dexter Landsberg, 34, in June this year, while he was on bail for attacking her . But, after being charged with common assault and criminal damage, Landsberg was released on bail. Just weeks later, Mrs Landsberg was found beaten to death at the couple's home in Hatfield. The case was referred to the Independent Police Complaints Commission, the police watchdog, which advised the force to carry out an investigation into its contact with the victim. Today, Landsberg pleaded guilty at St Albans Crown Court to his wife's murder. He had initially denied murder but changed his plea this morning. The defendant, who appeared wearing a grey suit, blue tie and white shirt, stood only to say 'guilty' after his lawyers asked the judge for the charge to be put to him again. Mrs Landsberg had phoned police several times to warn that she felt she was in danger . Two further charges of common assault and criminal damage - relating to the offences for which he was on bail at the time - were dropped by the prosecution. Abbas Lakha QC, defending Landsberg, said his client wanted to apologise to his wife's family, several of whom watched from the public gallery. He said: 'My client is anxious, I say this publicly. He would like to publicly apologise to Madina's family and friends for what happened.' He added: 'There was no intention to cause death but it is accepted that death clearly resulted from an assault by him, which had an intention of causing very serious harm.' Prosecution barrister James Norman, speaking outside court, said: 'He was arrested in April and charged with common assault and criminal damage to her mobile phone. 'He was also cautioned in 2012 for assaulting her and she had made other calls to the police that didn't result in any further action.' After its contact with Mrs Landsberg, Hertfordshire police referred itself to the police watchdog which advised the force to carry out its own investigation. The Independent Police Complaints Commission said: 'We received a referral from Hertfordshire Constabulary on 11 June 2014. 'After a careful assessment of the available evidence, we decided that Hertfordshire Constabulary should carry out a local investigation into their contact with Madina Landsberg prior to her death. 'We advised the force that if any evidence arises during their investigation that might merit this decision being reconsidered, this should be referred to us again.' A Hertfordshire Constabulary spokesman said: 'The background will all be laid down at the sentencing hearing on December 17 but there wasn't much contact between the police and the victim before she died. Landsberg pleaded guilty today at St Albans Crown Court to murder and will be sentenced later this month . 'It is obviously a terrible tragedy but not one involving the police. I understand the amount of contact wasn't significant. 'He was on our radar to some degree but it was peripheral.' On the case being referred to the IPCC, she added: 'That is a mandatory referral because there was some contact, but not very much. 'The case is also the subject of a domestic homicide review, which looks at all partners in health, the local authority and others.' The force was unable to comment on how many times the woman had contacted police before her death. Judge Stephen Gullick told the killer he would be remanded in custody for sentencing on December 17.","Madina Landsberg, 31, reported husband Dexter, 34, to police several times .

"A Jewish teenager at one of Britain’s top public schools was left distraught after a teacher said she would be sent to ‘one of your gas chambers’ because she had jumped the lunch queue. The astonishing outburst happened at girls-only North London Collegiate School, whose former pupils include actress Rachel Weisz, ChildLine founder Esther Rantzen and Vogue editor Anna Wintour. The teacher has apologised privately to the girl for the horrifying remark, but the school refuses to identify the woman or explain what, if any, disciplinary action has been taken against her. The incident took place at the girls-only North London Collegiate School which was rated 'excellent' in all categories in a recent inspection . Last night, the parents of the girl, who was 17 at the time, urged the headmistress to make a public statement to underline the seriousness of the incident. The Mail on Sunday knows the girl’s identity but has agreed to a request by her family not to publish her name. According to her father, the offensive comment was made after the girl committed a minor misdemeanour by unhooking a rope barrier within the lunch queue as she entered the dining hall in January.  It was overheard by a large number of other pupils waiting in line. The girl’s father said: ‘A teacher was passing by and she rushed up to my daughter and said, “Don’t do that or I’ll have to send you to the back of the queue or to one of your gas chambers.” ’ The teacher, who has worked at the school for several years, was not one of the student’s subject tutors and there had been virtually no previous contact between the two. The pupil’s father – who is a successful businessman – said: ‘It was very unpleasant, very uncalled-for and very unfortunate. My daughter was shocked and upset. She didn’t say anything to the teacher at the time but all her friends expressed amazement. They kept saying, “Did she really say that?” ’ Movie star Rachel Weisz, left, and Vogue editor Anna Wintour, right, are both former students of the school . The matter was reported by another family to the Community Security Trust, which combats anti-Semitism in Britain. It also campaigns for better public education about the Holocaust, in which six million Jews died – many of them gassed in Nazi concentration camps. Community Security Trust communications director Mark Gardner said: ‘This would be highly offensive in any circumstance, but to be directed at a pupil by a teacher is unheard of and makes it far worse. ‘We are working with all parties to resolve the matter.’ Esther Rantzen, another alumni, said: 'When I was there... it was a model of tolerance and I am absolutely astonished by this incident' North London Collegiate School has an outstanding academic record and fees for senior pupils are almost £6,000 a term. Founded in 1850, it stands in 30 acres of parkland in Stanmore and has Royal connections. Headmistress Bernice McCabe has directed the Prince of Wales Education Summer Schools for teachers and is now co-director of the Prince’s Teaching Institute. Between 20 and 25 per cent of North London Collegiate School pupils are Jewish, according to  deputy head Alex Wilson. The teacher who made the remark has apologised privately to the student, who is now 18 and studying for her A-levels. But the girl’s family say there has been a lack of transparency in the disciplinary process because it is not clear what sanctions, if any, the teacher has faced in the three months since the incident. The father said: ‘The school doesn’t deserve to be in the middle of a race issue. It is normally a model of correctness in these things. ‘But there should be an element of visibility so people see the teacher has been disciplined. My wife and  I would also like the school to make a public statement that there has been an incident and [the remark] was totally unacceptable.’ Esther Rantzen said: ‘When I was there, it was a most inclusive school in which everyone was very aware of the rights of others. It was a model of tolerance and I am absolutely astonished by this incident.’ The school was judged ‘excellent’ – the highest rating – in every category by the Independent Schools Inspectorate last year. The inspectors said in their report: ‘Pupils understand and respect other faiths and cultures. Staff provide excellent role models for polite and considerate behaviour.’ The school said in a statement: ‘North London Collegiate School is proud of its rich, multi-cultural history and celebrates equality and diversity within the school community. The school was recently made aware of an allegation of an offensive statement made by a member of staff. The school promptly commenced an investigation. ‘Having reached a determination and sought specialist legal advice, appropriate action was taken.’","Astonishing outburst happened at North London Collegiate School, where fees can reach £6,000 a term .

"A One Direction fan got more than she bargained for when she tried to get a selfie with Harry Styles... after falling over and landing in a giant pile of horse manure. The girl joined a crowd of hundreds of 'Directioners' outside the London Coliseum on Monday, where Harry was presenting a British Fashion Award.

But the rush was too much for one girl and she fell into a pile of dung which had been deposited outside the exclusive theatre by a passing police horse. Undetered, the die-hard fan picked herself back up and got close to the One Direction star, asking him for a selfie. Unfortunately for the fan, her devotion was not rewarded by Harry, who quickly jumped into an awaiting car. An onlooker said: 'She wasn't drunk, I think it was the heels she was wearing. When everyone started running she just crashed down on the floor. 'I thought she had fallen quite badly but she got straight up and carried on running. I've never seen such determination.' Harry had been rubbing shoulders with stars including Cara Delevingne and Kendall Jenner at the party, before awarding actress Emma Watson with the prestigious British Style Award.

"An Arizona wife accused of trying to kill her husband by injecting fecal matter into his intravenous line was sentenced Tuesday to a year in jail after being convicted of abuse. Rose Mary Vogel, 66, of Sun Lakes, pleaded guilty nearly two months ago to a charge of vulnerable adult abuse in the January 30 incident at Chandler Regional Hospital. The retired nurse - who has a masters and a bachelors degree in nursing -  had faced up to 10 years in prison. Her plea agreement called for an attempted murder charge to be dropped. Caught red-handed: Rose Mary Vogel, 66, was sentenced to four years of probation and one year of weekends in jail after she was found tampering with her husband's IV line at an Arizona hospital in January . Maricopa County Superior Court Judge Robert Gottsfield said Vogel could serve the jail time on weekends, the Arizona Republic reported. He also sentenced her to four years of probation. Authorities say two nurses saw Vogel tampering with her husband's IV line while he was in the hospital for a heart stent procedure earlier this year. The nurses were responding to a pump alarm that went off, and arrived to find Vogel touching the pump line. One nurse noticed a brown liquid in the saline solution that smelled. The nurse capped the line and went to find help, only to return to see Vogel trying to dump the solution in a trash can, according to AZ Central. A lab test later determined  substance found in the line was fecal matter. Police also say they found three syringes in Vogel's purse, and one had a brown substance on a protective cap. Her husband survived the contamination after becoming ill. Vogel said during the sentencing hearing that she was sleep-deprived and depressed when she contaminated the line and had no recollection of it. 'I've always loved my husband through sickness and in health,' she said. Her husband, Phillip Vogel, said he has forgiven his wife. On trial: Prosecutors claimed Vogel was not trying to kill her husband but further debilitate him . The two suggested their relationship is on the mend. 'It's so devastating on our family,' he said. 'Rose Mary is no danger to me.' Defense lawyer Lawrence Kazan has said in court records that his client had what appeared to be a fairly happy 35-year marriage. But he said there were unspecified problems that caused her to snap and try to harm her husband. Vogel is a retired registered nurse who has surrendered her nursing license to medical regulators. Kazan noted she had no prior criminal history.","Rose Mary Vogel, 66, of Sun Lakes, Arizona, was found tampering with her husband's intravenous line in January .

"Parents handed over legal guardianship of their children to a yoga master who beat and sexually exploited the young girls, an inquiry has been told. The child sexual abuse royal commission sitting in Sydney heard some parents living at the Satyananda Yoga Ashram at Mangrove Mountain in NSW in the 1980s signed over legal guardianship of their children to Swami Akhandananda and his partner Shishy. Some witnesses will give evidence they were beaten violently by both the swami and Shishy, who will give evidence at the hearing. The Satyananda Yoga Ashram (pictured above) at Mangrove Mountain in NSW at the centre of the child abuse inquiry was founded in November 1974 . The Mangrove ashram was founded in November 1974 with Akhandananda as director and spiritual leader. He was 22 and Shishy was 16. In 1976 residents began to move into the ashram - some with children. Peggy Dwyer, SC for the royal commission, said in her opening statement that children were sexually and physically abused at the ashram. She said some parents endorsed pension cheques payable to them in favour of the swami who was considered to be a spiritual, god-like man who had attained enlightenment. The ashram was a non-profit organisation which within a decade became a wealthy organisation with centres all over Australia. Former ashram residents are expected to give evidence that Swami Akhandananda (pictured) said they should have sex with him to grow spiritually . Akhandananda managed the finances with some help from others. Parents were separated from their children when they were sent to set up other ashrams around the country. Ms Dwyer said evidence from 11 former residents will show a pattern of ""sexual grooming by Akhandananda, which began when the children reached or were approaching puberty"". The grooming was followed by sexual abuse, including oral sex and sexual intercourse, by the time they reached the age of 14 or 15. ""It is anticipated that the former child residents will give evidence that they were told by Akhandananda that he needed to break down their physical barriers and that engaging in sexual activity with him was for their own spiritual growth,"" she said on Tuesday. The commission would hear that the abuse often occurred in the hut that Akhandananda shared with Shishy. Akhandananda was charged, convicted and jailed in the late 1980s for indecently assaulting four girls between the ages of 14 and 16. Shishy gave evidence at his court case. He spent 14 months in prison but the convictions were overturned on appeal by the High Court in 1991. He was released from jail and died six years later in 1997. The Royal Commission into Institutional Response to Child Sexual Abuse hearing continues in Sydney.

"Millie Mackintosh reveals her top hosting tips . The glamorous Made In Chelsea star is always showing off her perfectly put-together meals and culinary conquests on social media. And now Millie Mackintosh reveals her top tips for hosting the perfect dinner party this festive season exclusively to Femail. Millie's advice comes in light of new research showing two thirds of people (64 per cent) are shunning pubs, restaurants and parties, to instead open their homes to friends and family. However, this increase in generosity has led to a plethora of problems, with hopeless hosts admitting to a myriad of dinner party disasters. Problems range from not being prepared enough with food, drink and room dressing (53 per cent) to leaving guests to their own devices while preparing food (28 per cent) and struggling to decide on recipes (15 per cent). And with almost two thirds (62 per cent) of Britons more likely to host a get together in their homes in the run up to the festive season than during the rest of the year, dilemmas faced by the majority of people, such as what to cook (46 per cent) and planning drinks (26 per cent), is set to increase. Seven in ten (69 per cent) said  they have had gatecrashers at their gathering (ie neighbours, friends or acquaintances turning up unexpectedly). One in ten admit to passing off food (such as takeaways) as their own when hosting parties. And British dinner party hosts revealed they frequently lose essential props such as toilet paper (7 per cent), milk (5 per cent) and seats (28 per cent). The poll from  Tassimo has spurred the brand to come up with an 'ultimate solution to the nation's hosting woes' with their Perfect Host panel.

"Margaret Hodge said new laws are needed to provide a meaningful deterrent for those setting up tax avoidance schemes . The law should be changed to put the ‘shameless’ £2billion tax avoidance industry out of business, the head of Parliament’s spending watchdog said. Margaret Hodge, chairman of the Commons public accounts committee, said it was ‘unacceptable’ that accountancy firms and lawyers were making vast sums advising the wealthy on how to ‘rip off’ taxpayers. ‘It is crazy that only those who put their money into tax avoidance schemes are properly punished, and not those who design, promote and sell them,’ said Mrs Hodge, a former Labour minister. ‘Inevitably when we talk about tax avoidance the spotlight falls on the high-profile cases. 'But tax avoidance is not confined to a small number of wealthy companies and individuals – it is a whole, grubby industry from which shameless tax advisers and promoters are making big bucks. ‘That is simply unacceptable. We cannot have an industry in this country based solely on ripping off the public purse.’ The tax gap – the difference between the amount Government considers it is owed and the amount it actually collects – stands at £34billion. Chancellor George Osborne is expected to signal a further attempt to crack down on tax dodging in today’s Autumn Statement. There is speculation that he will make offshore tax evasion a criminal offence and target foreigners who hoard expensive property in London – by forcing them to prove they spend at least 90 days a year in their UK homes if they want to avoid capital gains tax. Mrs Hodge insisted the Government should go further – punishing those offering advice on tax avoidance with huge fines. Currently, those who put their money into tax avoidance schemes have to pay it back if the scheme is deemed unlawful, but there is no meaningful deterrent for those who set them up, she said. Ms Hodge's comments come after Starbucks said it will not pay 'normal' levels of UK tax for up to three years. Consumers hit out at the firm after it was revealed the company had paid just £8.6million since 1998 . ‘It is time we cracked down on these individuals – advisers, promoters and lawyers,’ she added. ‘There needs to be a powerful deterrent that says if you are involved in designing or selling these products you will face criminal prosecution.’ Her comments follow hints from the boss of Starbucks this week that the company will not pay ‘normal’ levels of tax in the UK for up to three years. The firm faced a consumer backlash after it emerged it had paid just £8.6million in corporation tax since coming to the UK in 1998. A Tory MP has apologised after he publicly urged the Government to ignore ‘dog-end’ voters living in ‘outlying regions’. Mark Garnier said he believed top earners needed certainty from the Chancellor that he was not going to increase tax rates for the rich to appease poorer voters. The 51-year-old former banker, who is a member of the Commons Treasury committee, said: ‘You’ve got these entrepreneurs who are worried about what is going to happen to their own personal rates of tax. 'We need to be giving a much clearer message to them that they don’t have to worry about politicians mucking around with tax rates in order to try and attract a few, sort of dog-end voters in sort of the outlying regions of the country.’ Speaking at an event organised by the Economic Affairs think-tank, Mr Garnier immediately added: ‘Not that they’re not important – but what is important is that businesses can feel surety in what is happening within tax rates.’ Mr Garnier last night apologised and said he ‘believed every voter is important everywhere’. But Labour MP Jon Ashworth said: ‘We are again seeing the true, nasty face of David Cameron’s Conservatives.’","Margaret Hodge demands laws to shut down 'grubby' tax avoidance firms .

"It's a Christmas tree like no other. Towering at 7ft tall, the creation was put together by takeaway bosses John and Corrine Clarkson. The Chippy Tree is made from 50kgs of potatoes, 20 loaves of bread and 22 baps, and is on display at Mister Eaters Eating Emporium in Preston, Lancashire. The 7ft high Christmas tree is made from 50kgs of potatoes, 20 loaves of bread and a further 22 baps. It is the brainchild of takeaway boss John Clarkson (pictured) who runs Mister Eaters in Preston, Lancashire . The couple, who were also behind battered Spam doughnuts and the world's tallest burger, made the creation to spread festive cheer. After taking a photo, the takeaway bosses decided to hand out their sandwiches to punters free of charge. However, interested customers could buy the work of art for £160. The tree stands so tall that 54-year-old Mr Clarkson had to forgo the star on the top. Mrs Clarkson, 50, said: 'We always like to do something a little bit unusual, and we had a good vibe about this. Christmas treats with a twist: Corinne Clarkson with Mister Eaters Eating Emporium's battered mince pies . 'We were trying to think of a catchy names for it but is is basically a Christmas-tree shaped chip butty. 'It's common place to do battered Christmas mince pies and puddings now and so we thought we would put that on its head but still do something in keeping with festivities. 'When making it we had to act quick - we were really busy shovelling the chips into the butties, it took an hour to build. We would have gone higher but it would have gone through the ceiling. 'The customers are not shocked by what we do anymore. They like it and enjoy seeing what we'll come up with next.' The couple are famous for their wacky culinary creations including battered Spam doughnuts (pictured) Record-breaking attempt: The Pie-scraper was created earlier this year and stood up at 5ft 4inches tall. It was filled with bacon butties, pies, pizzas and spaghetti Bolognese . 'It's definitely not your standard chip butty like what we usually sell for £1.85. I think people felt a bit bad eating it because it looked so amazing stood next to the window for everyone to see. It's been a real success in the run up to Christmas.' But Mrs Clarkson is reluctant to reveal how the potato tree keeps vertical. 'It's not got a rod down the middle like most people think but there is a support system in place. 'A lot of preparation goes into it before it is built and John is the creative one. We did decide to steer clear of sauces though just in case it got a bit too messy.'","John Clarkson's tree stands tall in Mister Eaters, Preston, Lancashire .

"Four of the remaining nine USS Arizona survivors of the Pearl Harbor attack are vowing this year's anniversary won't be their last reunion. The men in their 90s gathered for a news conference Tuesday in a building overlooking the memorial that sits on top of the Arizona, a battleship that sank in the December 7, 1941 attack. Even though it's the last official survivor gathering of the USS Arizona Reunion Association, the men said they still plan to get together, even if not in Hawaii. Scroll down for video . Reunion: USS Arizona survivors from left, John Anderson, Don Stratton, Louis Conter and Lauren Bruner arrive Tuesday, December 2, 2014, in Pearl Harbor, Hawaii .

'We'll be back out here no matter whether the rest of the crowd can make it or not."" Donald Stratton, 92, of Colorado Springs, Colorado, was one of the few survivors of a gun director in the forward part of the ship. More than 65 per cent of his body was burned.

Sunday marks the 73rd anniversary of the Japanese attack that killed about 2,400 sailors, Marines and soldiers. During a private event Sunday, the four men will toast their shipmates, drinking from replicas of champagne glasses from the Arizona. They will share a bottle of sparkling wine that was a gift to the survivors association from President Gerald Ford's visit to Spain in 1975. The men arrived at the Pearl Harbor visitor center on Tuesday to military salutes, music from the U.S. Navy Pacific Fleet Band and photos from tourists. At the news conference, they reminisced about memories of the attack. 'I learned something about faith,' said John Anderson, 97, of Roswell, New Mexico, recalling that he had just gone to church services and was heading to breakfast when someone said they saw the planes coming. He became teary-eyed as he discussed his twin brother dying in the attack.

The survivors on Tuesday also watched a live-feed of a dive along the Arizona's sunken hull, which still holds the bodies of more than 900 of about 1,177 men who died on the battleship. Ashes of 38 survivors are interred there. National Park Service Historian Daniel Martinez, moderating Tuesday's discussion, seemed overcome with emotion when he announced that Arizona survivor Lauren Bruner, 94, of La Mirada, California, last year signed paperwork for his intentions to be interred there. Conter plans to do the same, he said. 'It seems like after a while nobody pays attention to them anymore, after about five years,' Bruner said of his decision not to be buried in a cemetery.

"Arrested: A picture of Garry Handlen taken around the time he allegedly killed two young girls in British Columbia. He is now facing two charges of murder . A 67-year-old man is facing two counts of first-degree murder over the killings of two young girls that shocked Canada more than three decades ago. Garry Handlen, from Ontario, is accused of killing 11-year-old Kathryn-Mary Herbert in 1975 and 12-year-old Monica Jack in 1978. Officers from the Royal Canadian Mounted Police arrested him on Friday in Surrey, British Columbia, after a long campaign by the victims' families and a cold-case review. Kathryn-Mary Herbert disappeared on September 24, 1975, as she made her way home in Abbotsford, a city in the south of BC. Her remains were uncovered two months later. She had suffered a broken jaw and a fractured skull. Monica Jack vanished on May 6, 1978, while riding her bike north on Highway 5A near Merritt, a small city in BC's Nicola Valley. Her bike was found the next day but her remains were only found 17 years later. The RCMP said Handlen had been a suspect in the killings shortly after they happened but it's only now that they have enough evidence to charge him, Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) News reported. Investigators wouldn't be drawn on what the new evidence is that is alleged to link Handlen to the killings, but they reportedly said advances in forensic science had been a factor. A man with the same name as Handlen was convicted of the rape of an 18-year-old housewife in 1971 and sentenced to five-and-a-half years in jail. Eight years later, a Garry Taylor Handlen was handed an 18-year prison term for the rape of 21-year-old hitchhiker. Speaking at a news conference at British Columbia's Mountie HQ, Madeline Lanaro, Monica's mother, stood with tears streaming down her face as she said the 'hurt never goes away'. 'Everybody was at a loss about where she could be,' the Vancouver Sun quoted her as saying. 'We never gave up.' Victims: Kathryn-Mary Herbert, left, disappeared on September 24, 1975. Her body was found two months later. Monica Jack, right, vanished on May 6, 1978. Her remains went undiscovered for 17 years . Kathyn-Mary's mother, Shari Greer, also spoke through tears. 'There is no such thing as a cold case to the families, nor is there ever closure, only resolution surrounding the events,' she said. Superintendent Ward Lymburner, the officer in charge of the special projects unit whose investigations led to the charges against Handler, said three decades of investigation had pinpointed the same suspect. 'He was brought into the investigation as a suspect or person of interest in the investigation early on,' he was quoted as saying by Canada's Global News. 'It has taken us this long for us to gather the evidence needed to satisfy the courts to bring him forward on charges today.'","Garry Handlen accused of murdering an 11-year-old and a 12-year-old .

"The University of Texas at Austin is missing about 100 brains - about half of the specimens the university had in a collection preserved in jars of formaldehyde. One of the missing brains is believed to have belonged to clock tower sniper Charles Whitman. It is thought students may have swiped the brains to display in their rooms. The University of Texas at Austin is missing about 100 brains - about half of the specimens the university had in a collection preserved in jars of formaldehyde; a man is pictured above looking at a brain inside a jar at the Museum of Science and Industry in Manchester . The Austin State Hospital had transferred the brains to the university about 28 years ago under a 'temporary possession' agreement. The psychology lab only had room for 100 brains, so the rest were moved to the basement of the university's Animal Resources Center. The brains being stored there are now missing. Psychology Professor Tim Schallert, co-curator of the collection, told the Austin American-State: 'We think somebody may have taken the brains, but we don't know at all for sure.' His co-curator, psychology Professor Lawrence Cormack, said, 'It's entirely possible word got around among undergraduates and people started swiping them for living rooms or Halloween pranks.' The university said it will investigate 'the circumstances surrounding this collection since it came here nearly 30 years ago' and that it's 'committed to treating the brain specimens with respect.'

The university's agreement with the hospital required the school to remove any data that might identify the person from whom the brain came. However, Mr Schallert said Whitman's brain likely was part of the collection. He said: 'It would make sense it would be in this group. We can't find that brain.' Whitman's 1966 rampage at the University of Texas killed 16 people, including his mother and wife. The 100 remaining brains at the school have been moved to the Norman Hackerman Building, where they are being scanned with high-resolution resonance imaging equipment.

"This chilling footage from a conservation park in the US shows a tiger stalking its keeper while his back his turned. In the video captured by senior keeper Steve Klein,  a Bengal-Siberian mix named Mohan shows off his hunting skills at the Cedar Cove tiger habitat in Kansas.

Mohan is a Bengal-Siberian mix currently living in Kansas' Cedar Cove's tiger habitat . Steve set up a backwards-facing camera so that he could turn away from the animal. In doing so, Steve believed that Mohan would begin to attempt to approach his 'prey.' Although he moves cautiously at first, Mohan is careful to use ambient noise and to adjust his path out of his prey's field of view in order to remain undetected.

"Court appearance: Jaleel Tariq Abdul-Jabbaar, 46, of the Seattle suburb of Kirkland, made an initial appearance in federal court on Tuesday to face three counts of making interstate threats, according to the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Western District of Washington. The FBI has arrested a Washington man for making repeated threats against the life of Officer Darren Wilson, writing Facebook posts demanding, 'We need to kill this white motha f***a and anything that has a badge on'. Jaleel Tariq Abdul-Jabbaar, 46, started writing the messages immediately after Wilson shot Brown dead in August and according to the criminal complaint read in court on Tuesday in Seattle,'knowingly and willfully transmitted in interstate and foreign commerce' threats against Wilson's life.' In addition to the specific social media threats, the Nintendo employee, who boasts an ISIS flag on his Facebook page, is also accused of trying to acquire a firearm to act out his desire as spokesman of 'the oppressed' who 'need to kill this white cop.' If convicted, Abdul-Jabbaar faces a maximum of five years in prison and has been detained in custody ahead of a December 5 detention hearing in US District Court in Seattle. It is unclear how he will plead or if he will be represented by an attorney, but the father of three has already deleted some of the more incriminating posts from his open Facebook profile. However, in court on Tuesday, his threats against Wilson and Ferguson officers were read out, including those he has since removed. In one that dates from November 24, the day the grand jury declined to charge officer Wilson, Abdul-Jabbaar uploaded a photograph of a Wilson to his Facebook page with the message, 'Ready to go and kill some cops.' He followed that up later in the day with, 'We need to kill this white motha F***a and anything that has a badge on.' Murderous support: Abdul-Jabbaar displays the flag of ISIS on his Facebook page - onto which he posted chilling threats towards Officer Darren Wilson . Threats: Abdul-Jabbaar is accused of posting a string of threats to his personal Facebook page targeting police officers, specifically Wilson. The criminal complaint quoted one of the postings as saying: 'We the oppressed people need to kill this white cop.' The next day there was a cartoon depicting a black man killing a white officer, with the message: 'We black folks should've been doing this to the police last night.' Previously, on November 11, a Facebook message seen and recorded by FBI Agent Brett Grover, Abdul-Jabbaar wrote, 'Are there any REAL BLACK MEN that would love to go down to Ferguson Missouri to give back those bullets that [Wilson] fired into the body of Mike Brown.' The message ends, 'If we're unable to locate [Wilson] then We'll return them to his wife and if not her then his children.' In other, shocking posts to his Facebook page, Abdul-Jabbaar says that he 'would love to smoke a white motha f***'n cop.' Born William Cox, Abdul-Jabbaar changed his name in 1990 after converting to Islam and according to the Smoking Gun has been divorced several times. Revenge: Federal officials said Abdul-Jabbaar began making threats shortly after the Aug. 9 shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson, an incident that touched off weeks of angry protests in the St. Louis suburb and calls for Wilson's arrest . Discoverd: Federal prosecutors said Abdul-Jabbaar's online postings went beyond free and protected speech . Action: Defendant Jaleel Tarik Abdul-Jabbaar, 46, of Kirkland began posting threats on Facebook soon after the shooting of Michael Brown, according to the criminal complaint. Shocking: Federal prosecutors said Abdul-Jabbaar posted inflammatory messages for months that called on others to join him on a trip to Ferguson to ""give back the bullets"" that were fired at Brown. His Facebook page has the image of the ISIS flag as the cover photograph and Acting United States Attorney Annette L. Hayes said in a statement, 'Although we each have the right to express our views about the decision reached by the state grand jury in Ferguson, Missouri, we cannot tolerate violence or threats of violence that are intended to intimidate, and ultimately silence debate. Such threats are crimes, and the individuals who make them must be held to account' Officer Darren Wilson resigned from th Ferguson police force on Sunday after receiving death threats aimed at him and other colleagues. His decision to leave the force came after his fatal shooting of Michael Brown on August 9 and the grand jury's failure to indict him. The announcement that Wilson will face no charges led to huge rioting in Ferguson, followed by looting and the burning of a number of businesses. No charges: A grand jury last week declined to indict Wilson on criminal charges, sparking demonstrations across the country over allegations of racial bias and police mistreatment of minorities . Fire: Wilson resigned from the Ferguson Police Department last week, saying part of his decision stemmed from possible backlash against fellow officers . Abdul-Jabbaar has several prior convictions, including selling crack cocaine, domestic violence, weapons possession and assault. He was also once found guilty of drugging and having 'indecent contact' with an underage girl who was suffering mental illness. His last appearance in a court came in 2008 when he was sentenced to a year in prison following a gunfight with another man. A sealed court document contends that Abdul-Jabbaar's sentenced may have been lessened by his cooperation with federal authorities in giving evidence against two al-Qaeda operatives who opened a training camp in Oregon in 1997. While Abdul-Jabbaar had no involvement with the camp, his attorney at the time said that his client wanted to help authorities in their case against the two men who are now in custody.","FBI arrest Jaleel Tariq Abdul-Jabbaar on Tuesday for threatening to kill Officer Darren Wilson .

There are signs that people are now more willing to spend money on large items which they might have delayed buying in the wake of the financial crash. ‘The economy has witnessed signs of economic recovery, despite consumers remaining price conscious,’ the ONS said. ‘There is evidence that consumer confidence is increasing slowly; increases in household expenditure are largely focused on items such as housing. ‘However, the results have also seen an increase in expenditure on big ticket items, such as new cars in 2013, indicating that pent up demand is being realised.’ Around 14 per cent of spending - £74.70 – went on housing, fuel and electricity costs, excluding mortgages. The next biggest outlay was transport, coming to £70.40 a week. This includes petrol, diesel and bus and rail fares, but also covers the cost of buying new cars. On average families spent £8.30 each week on the cost of buying new cars and vans and £12 a week on second hand vehicles. More than a third of the spending is on loans or higher purchase deals, suggesting families are choosing to buy a new car now and pay it off over several years. The ONS said: ‘Higher average household expenditure on transport between 2012 and 2013 can partly be attributed to increased purchase of new cars. Vehicle purchases were recorded as being at a six-year high with 1,074,622 new private cars registered. ‘Purchasing new cars is an area where households could moderate or defer expenditure, which may lead to demand building up over time. ‘This is sometimes referred to as “pent up demand”. This may have fuelled the increase in sales of new cars seen in 2013, with consumers replacing vehicles they kept hold of through the recent downturn.’ Despite families feeling the pinch, spending on recreation and culture has held up and actually increased between 2001-02 and 2013, from £53.80 (adjusted for inflation) to £63.90 on average per week. It covers everything from the cost of cinema and sports tickets, to computers, TVs, games, gardening, and package holidays. It suggests that even at a time of concern about the economy, British families have continued to spend on life’s luxuries. ‘A common feature of these products and services is that they would generally be considered to constitute discretionary spending, so it is interesting that these types of expenditures have held up over time,’ the ONS said. Spending on package holidays abroad accounted for an average of £21.00 per week in 2013, in part as a result of the growing cruise market with number of people taking an ocean cruise continuing to grow by 1.5 per cent in 2013. ‘Expenditure on items such as TV, video, computers and recreational activities has also held up over time, showing the high priority placed on these goods and services by many households, regardless of economic circumstances,’ the ONS said.","Average weekly household spending rose by 3% from £501 in 2012 to £517.30 in 2013, new figures reveal .

"When new mother Lou Burns arrived at Claridge’s for afternoon tea, she knew the waiters would be on hand to make sure she had everything she could wish for. What she didn’t want, however, was this giant napkin to cover her up as she breastfed her 12-week-old daughter Isadora. Staff at the five-star hotel in Mayfair told Mrs Burns, 35, to use the napkin to avoid ‘causing offence’ to other guests. And although she is smiling in this picture she posted on Twitter, the mother of three said she felt humiliated and burst into tears afterwards. Upset: Lou Burns, 35, was breastfeeding her 12-week-old baby (left) at the luxury Claridge's hotel in Mayfair when waiters told her to cover up with a large napkin (right) to avoid 'causing offence' to fellow guests . Outrage: Prestigious hotel Claridge's has been criticised after staff ordered Ms Burns, 35, to cover herself up . ‘I was really shocked as I had never experienced this before,’ she told the Mail. ‘Through my tears I tried to explain that I was really quite cross. ‘I’m not on some crusade. I just think people shouldn’t be treated like that. It would be nice to have an apology and for them to change their policy to not make any other breast-feeding women feel like second-class citizens. 'Breastfeeding is natural and we’re told it’s best for the baby. It’s a bit silly to say that people would be offended by it.’ Mrs Burns, who is married to comedy actor Nick Burns, took her mother, sister and daughter Isadora to Claridge’s art deco Foyer for afternoon tea on Monday. She said: ‘It was an annual treat that we have at Christmas time. We’ve been there before and we’ve loved it. My mother had travelled all the way down from Birmingham. ‘We sat down and I started to feed her very discreetly, but within moments of us sitting down, the waiter came over. Embarrassed: Mrs Burns, who was dining with her mother, sister and 12-week old daughter Isadora, said she was left so embarrassed by the incident that she would never return to the five star hotel . ‘He had this big napkin in his hand and he said he was sorry but it was company policy for feeding mothers to cover themselves, and could I cover myself with this.’ Seeing that she was visibly upset by their actions, they called their manager – who again confirmed the policy. Mrs Burns said the baby was not comfortable with the napkin over its head and was not able to feed properly. Finally the management said she could continue without it as long as there were no complaints from anyone else. She said the hotel knocked some money off the bill and apologised for upsetting her. But she added: ‘I just told them I was so offended, and so humiliated. I’ve been here quite a few times and I thought it was somewhere you could sit down and breast feed and not be bothered. ‘You couldn’t see anything while I was feeding, because I had a vest underneath my jumper. No-one complained. Family: Mother-of-three Mrs Burns, is married to actor Nicholas Burns, who is known for his Nathan Barley character (right) and has also appeared on Benidorm and The Mighty Boosh . ‘Women are under so much pressure to breastfeed and it’s not easy. I’ve had two other children that I’ve struggled to breast feed and I think women should be more supported, especially when they are trying not to draw attention to themselves. ‘I told them I couldn’t see myself coming back.’ Posting pictures of the incident online, she wrote: ‘Asked to cover up with this ridiculous shroud while #breastfeeding so not to cause offence @ClaridgesHotel today. 'So much more obvious with it than without! Such a shame I can never go back.... @ClaridgesHotel #breastfeeding. ‘Staff were incredibly polite as you would hope. Think they felt bad....’ The comments were retweeted by her husband, 37, who appeared in Nathan Barley, The Mighty Boosh and the IT Crowd. Mrs Burns, who lives in Streatham, south London, and works in finance, has since been inundated with messages of support. One Twitter user wrote: ‘How can the sight of mother feeding her child do anything else than make people feel good! @ClaridgesHotel apologies needed,’ while Lucy Bunting added: ‘Under the 2010 discrimination act, asking a bf’ing mother to cover up is illegal and disgusting behaviour!!! ‘This is clearly their policy not just a rogue member of staff! Even more unacceptable!” On its website, the NHS says: ‘You shouldn’t ever be made to feel uncomfortable about breastfeeding in public. In fact, the Equality Act 2010 has made it illegal for anyone to ask a breastfeeding woman to leave a public place such as a cafe, shop or public transport. A Claridge's spokesman told MailOnline: 'We are saddened to see what is being discussed and we feel we need to clarify that breastfeeding is of course embraced at Claridge’s. 'All we ask is that mothers are discrete towards other guests.' The row comes after a cafe owner in Surrey was forced to apologise last month for  putting a sign in its window telling mothers they should breastfeed in the toilets. Tillings Cafe came under fire after a customer posted a picture of the notice - which informs customers they can use the disabled toilet if they want to breastfeed their babies - on Twitter. But the family-owned coffee shop in Gomshall, Surrey was forced to remove the sign after the National Childbirth Trust, the UK's largest parenting charity, asked for it to be taken down. Owner June Radford said the sign had been a 'huge miscommunication'. She said: 'We have had many happy breastfeeding mums in our cafe in the three years we have been open and we continue to support breastfeeding. In October, Facebook was forced to reinstated a picture of a mother breastfeeding her severely premature baby for the first time after it was removed from the site because it ‘breached nudity rules’ Emma Bond, 24, posted the picture of herself with Carene, who was born 12 weeks early, but soon found it had been removed after it had been deemed 'offensive'. Meanwhile in September, breastfeeding mother Olivia Pozniak claimed she was forced to cover up with a dirty dishcloth while joining friends for breakfast at a Wetherspoon pub in Bexleyheath. In June 27-year-old Carrie Davies says she was left feeling 'embarrassed and ashamed' after staff at Global Buffet in Cardiff suggested she move while feeding her four-month-old son. And in May, Channel 4 journalist and film-maker Jenny Kleeman was ordered to stop breastfeeding her child by a security guard in a London café because customers were ‘not allowed’ to breastfeed at the table. Mothers who staged a mass breastfeeding protest at a Sports Direct store in Nottingham in support for Wioletta Komar, who claims she was asked to leave the premises for breastfeeding her son . According to the Equality Act of 2010, it is discriminatory to treat a woman unfavourably because she is breastfeeding. However, in September a breastfeeding mother claimed today that she was ordered to cover up with a dirty dishcloth while joining friends for a breakfast. Olivia Pozniak, a single 25-year-old, was feeding her 11-week-old son Louie at the Furze Wren pub owned by J D Wetherspoon in Bexleyheath, Kent, when she was told to cover up. Meanwhile in August Natasha Barnett, 29, from Newport Pagnell, Buckinghamshire, was told by a lifeguard at Middleton Pool that she could not breastfeed her five-month-old daughter Olive because it was 'classed as eating and drinking'. In June, a mother was asked to sit in a corner by a waitress while breastfeeding her son - to keep her away from schoolchildren eating in the same restaurant. Carrie Davies, 27, was left feeling 'embarrassed and ashamed' after staff at Global Buffet in Cardiff suggested she move while feeding her four-month-old son Trystan. Ms Davies, who was lunching with a friend, was offered a spot by the restaurant's toilets, which bosses at the restaurant say was more 'convenient' for her in light of a large school party who had started eating there. It comes after around 70 women descended on Sports Direct in Nottingham city centre in April to show support for 25-year-old Wioletta Komar, who claimed she was kicked out of the premises earlier this year for breastfeeding her three-month-old son. She claims a member of staff suddenly marched over and told her that breastfeeding mothers were not welcome because of 'company policy'. The sales assistant then told her that the store had no facilities for her and suggested she should go to McDonald's which had a baby and mother room.","Lou Burns, 35, asked to cover up while feeding daughter Isadora .

"A young Sydney woman who could face the death penalty after being charged by Chinese authorities for allegedly attempting to smuggle the drug ‘ice’ from China was reported missing by a worried family member last month. It emerged overnight that Kalynda Davis, a talented  basketballer in her early 20s from the Penrith region in Sydney’s west, and Peter Gardner, 25, from Richmond, will face a Chinese court this week accused of trying to smuggle 75kg of methamphetamine to Australia. Friends have taken to Facebook to lament the pair's desperate situation. ‘Kalyndra was an amazing girl she just got herself into the wrong crowd,’ said a former colleague of the blonde. ‘I honestly hope they don’t give her the death penalty though.’ Kalynda Davis, left, and Peter Gardner, right have been charged over allegedly attempting to import drugs from China to Australia . Kalynda Davis, pictured here at a younger age, is one of two people who are facing drug charges in China . Mates of Gardner described him as a good man and wondered how it got to this point. Brad King told Daily Mail Australia: 'He was actually a really genuine bloke who would do anything for his mates.' Another friend said: 'He was doing so so well for himself as well, and now this!' Daily Mail Australia understands the pair had only known each other for only a matter of weeks before they flew from Sydney International Airport to Guangzhou on November 5. That same day, both Davis and Gardner were reported missing to police. The muscular, blonde-haired Gardner, who recently worked for a construction company in Kurmond in Sydney's greater west, was last spotted in Australia that day near his home in Richmond. The pair  booked their seats on the plane at the Flight Centre at a nearby shopping centre, Nine News reported. Three days after the pair arrived in Guangzhou, Davis and Gardner were apprehended by Chinese authorities at the airport, the broadcaster said. 'Kalynda was an amazing girl she just got herself into the wrong crowd,' said one friend . A New South Wales police spokeswoman said the matter was referred to the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade as soon as Davis was located overseas. Australia is currently in the grip of an ice crisis, with use of the drug more than doubling from 21 per cent in 2010 to 50 per cent of drug users in 2013, according to the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare. A number of Australians have been detained overseas on drug charges in recent times, most famously including Schapelle Corby, who served nine years in an Indonesian prison. Some have been put to death, including Vietnamese Australian Van Tuong Nguyen, who was hung for drug trafficking on December 2, 2005. The blonde-haired, blue-eyed Davis has many friends in Sydney's west. She is understood to occasionally visit music festivals. Sources said she regularly played basketball in Penrith. In an old posting on a social media profile when she younger, Davis said 'bball [basketball] is my life.' Mr Gardner's former employer Michael Kulakovski told the Nine Network he was deeply concerned for the young man's future. 'To be caught with substance in China is probably one of the worst countries to be caught in,' Mr Kulakovski said. 'He was doing really good, he had a lot of work and he was earning good money. (I) don't know why he's done this.' Mr Kulakovski did not return Daily Mail Australia's calls.  The Department of Foreign Affairs refused to comment when approached on Wednesday morning. Davis and Gardner's case are expected to be heard by a Chinese court later this week. Do you know more?

"Shouting and banging on doors, city officials in Silicon Valley stapled and taped notices on hand built structures, tents and tree trunks warning more than 200 residents of what is likely the nation's largest homeless encampment that the bulldozers are coming. People living in the camp, known as The Jungle, must be out by Thursday or face arrest for trespassing. On Monday morning, more than 20 police officers and construction workers walked through the mile square encampment, more muddy and trash strewn than ever after an unusual fall rainstorm. Get out or else: Police officers and city officials hand out warning notices at a Silicon Valley homeless encampment known as The Jungle on Monday . Bulldozers are coming: A sign in support of The Jungle is posted at the Silicon Valley homeless encampment. City officials began posting notices on hand built structures, tents and tree trunks warning the 200 residents of what is likely the nation's largest homeless encampment that the bulldozers are coming . 'You guys have until Thursday to pull everything out,' shouted Carlos Tovar, a contractor hired by the city for debris removal and clean up. Shouting and banging on doors, the team walked the windy paths between compounds surrounded by woven reeds to tarp strewn structures tied to trees. Bewildered residents, many awakened by the shouts, were handed yellow warning posters: '!!!ATTENTION!!!' read the notices. 'The City of San Jose will be conducting a cleanup of illegal encampments in this area....' Police officers, using batons to smack open plywood doors and knives to cut tent walls, joined about a dozen construction crew members who took photos to document the situation. Residents were ordered to get leashes on the dozens of dogs running loose. Naomi Garcia crumbled into tears when they thrust the notice into her hand. 'This is hard,' she said. 'Sorry. Sorry.' Garcia said she's been homeless for seven years and hasn't had the wherewithal to get a social worker, public assistance and housing aid. 'I was waiting for my housing and I never got it,' she said. 'You have to go to certain places and do certain things and I just couldn't do that.' Makeshift homes: San Jose police officer Eduardo Sandoval looks inside a makeshift tent as notices to move are handed out at the Silicon Valley homeless encampment . A resident peeks out from inside a trailer after receiving an order to move. People living in the Silicon Valley camp must be out by Thursday or face arrest for trespassing . San Jose Homelessness Response Team Project Manager Ray Bramson said that increased violence, wet weather and unsanitary conditions make it imperative the camp is cleared. In the last month one resident tried to strangle someone with a cord of wire down there, he said. Another was nearly beaten to death with a hammer. And the State Water Resources Control Board has been demanding that polluted Coyote Creek, which cuts through the middle, get cleaned out. Most residents reluctantly read their notices and said they would have to find another place to park their shopping carts and pitch their tents. But some ran from the authorities. 'We've got a runner,' police shouted on occasion, as someone dashed down a muddy path, unpursued, into the tangle of trees and trash. At least one person was arrested for having an outstanding warrant. In the past 18 months, the city of San Jose has spent more than $4 million on solving the problems at the encampment, housing 137 people so far. Former Jungle resident Maria Esther Salazar, who was housed in June after 30 years on the street or in jail, was surprised Thursday to hear her former neighbors were getting moved out. 'That's just tough,' she said. 'Where are they supposed to go?' She said she's moved on with her life, seeing a doctor, caring for her dogs, even cooking the Thanksgiving turkey at her brother's house surrounded by family for the first time since she was a child. Attention! Robert Aguirre, a resident at the Silicon Valley homeless encampment, shows a notice asking him to move . Carlos Tovar, a contractor in charge of cleanup, left, hands out a warning notice to a resident. Officials intend to clean up the trash filled area in hopes of restoring its woodlands and waterways . Another 60 people in The Jungle have been given housing vouchers to help pay rent but social workers have been unable to find homes for them. The last camp clean out was in May 2012 when about 150 people were moved out of The Jungle. Many returned and others, swept from other encampments in San Jose, joined them. The encampment is in stark contrast to its surrounding area in the heart of the Silicon Valley, a region leading the country for job growth, income, innovation and venture capital. Tech giants Google, Apple, Yahoo, eBay, Facebook, Intel and many more call the 1,850 square mile stretch of business parks, small cities and suburbs south of San Francisco home. But as tech roars back from the recession, housing costs have soared and more than 5000 people now sleep outside in streets, parks and under freeways there. When The Jungle is cleared later this week, city officials plan to send in trash trucks and bulldozers to haul out tons of hazardous and human waste. They'll use heavy machinery to fill excavated sections where people have been living underground. And they'll try to restore the creek beds. Jennifer Loving, executive director of Destination: Home who has been working to house homeless people in the area, toured the camp last week warning residents they had to get out. But in a parking lot about 20 feet up a hill above The Jungle she sighed and shook her head. 'There's nowhere for them to go,' she said. 'We don't have the housing. We can't magically create it.' Police and city officials look into a makeshift home built underground at the encampment. Officials intend to fill in pits like these .

"A three-year-old girl was able to walk half a mile from her nursery school to her family home on her own after staff failed to spot she had left the school grounds, it has emerged. The youngster wandered out of the nursery which is attached Springdale Infant School, in Wolverhampton, West Midlands, without staff realising on November 7. A member of staff is now being investigated over the incident and has been moved roles within the nursery while the apparent blunder is investigated. An investigation has been launched after the three-year-old girl wandered out of the nursery which is attached Springdale Infant School, in Wolverhampton, West Midlands (pictured), without staff realising . The young girl was not injured as a result of the incident, despite walking half a mile on her own and unsupervised. Parents have expressed their shock at the incident, which occurred at the end of the nursery day. One parent, who wished to remain anonymous, said: 'They need to do something to stop this happening again. 'The children come out of the building to be met by their parents but this little girl just went out by herself. 'She didn't come to any harm but that's not the point. This could have been so much worse. It's every parent's worst nightmare. 'Apparently her home is a good half-a-mile away and she would have need to cross a couple of roads too. 'It's scary what could have happened.' The school's headteacher confirmed an investigation is underway and said a member of staff had been 'assigned to alternative duties' pending the outcome. The nursery has also 'strengthened' its procedures . Cathy Foley, the school's headteacher, said procedures had been 'strengthened' at the nursery in the wake of the incident. She said: 'The welfare of our pupils is our top priority and an investigation is currently underway into the incident which occurred on November 7. 'A member of staff has been assigned to alternative duties pending the outcome of this investigation, and it would be inappropriate to comment further at this stage.

"A Wisconsin man had an asthma attack and died Sunday morning, after police stopped the car rushing him to the hospital. Passenger Casey Kressin, 29, was unresponsive after EMS showed up and took him to St. Joseph's Hospital, where he was pronounced dead, WEAU reported. The car he was in was spotted by police  speeding and going past a red light around 2:05am, the Chippewa Falls Police Department said in a release. 'By the time that the officer was able to get close to the vehicle to make a traffic stop, it was probably about a mile later,' Wendy Stelter, the town's Chief of Police, said in an interview with the station. Scroll down for video . Passenger: Casey Kressin was suffering an asthma attack when the vehicle he was in was stopped by police for speeding and running a red light . Incident: The car Kressin was in raced through this traffic light on its way to the hospital . 'When the officer made this traffic stop, there was an adult female that exited the driver's side and there was an adult male that exited the passenger's side,' Stelter also said. The release stated that 'The operator [of the car] yelled to the officer that the man was having an asthma attack and that he needed to get to the emergency room. 'The man knelt down on the pavement near the rear of the stopped vehicle and indicated that he needed his inhaler.' The police officer contacted an emergency dispatcher, and both the cop and the female driver tended to Kressin before EMS showed up around 2:12am, Chippewa Falls police said. Stelter told WEAU 'Just about six minutes later that EMS arrived on scene and um, they then took the patient and transported him to the hospital and he was later pronounced deceased at the - at St. Joseph's Hospital.' Chippewa Falls police said that there was an autopsy at Ramsey County Medical Center in Minnesota. 'What was probably going on in that officer's mind is that ""This man is sitting here and I'going to keep him calm until the ambulance arrives,""' Stelter also said. 'It's just very sad because the officer feels that he did what he should have done and I truly support him in that, and yet the family has lost a family member, obviously, and that's just very sad.' Danger: Casey Kressin was unresponsive after EMS showed up several minutes after the car was stopped. His girlfriend Leah Hryniewicki, pictured right, has claimed police did not allow her to keep driving . Emergency: Kressin was transported to St. Joseph's Hospital, where he was pronounced dead . Stelter upheld the officer's choice, and said 'I think the officer made the best decision. It's just so very unfortunate that it's how things fell out.' WQOW reported Kressin's girlfriend, Leah Hryniewicki, was behind the wheel of the car at the time of the incident. She wrote on Facebook that her daughter Paige was also present. 'we got pulled over the cop's won't let me take him to the hospital by the time the ambulance got there casey was not breathing they did cpr the whole way to the hospital and at the hospital he went into cardiac arrest,' she wrote on Facebook. She continued 'I miss him so much and I don't understand why God took 'him from us. The pain he went through waiting for that ambulance and the amount of care he didn't get from the cop's and emt I feel there was more that could of been done.' Hryniewicki had been very upset and her daughter was also one of her passengers, so the officer did not allow her to drive, Stelter told WQOW.","Casey Kressin, 29, was inside a car spotted by police around 2:05am speeding and skipping the red light .

"Controversial independent senator Jacqui Lambie has interrupted Senate tributes for fallen cricketer Phillip Hughes, in a bid to force a rushed debate on her private bill to raise Defence pay. In an attempt to hijack the government's agenda in the final days of the parliamentary year, Senator Lambie cut short a move to honour the young cricketer who died last week. Under fire for her contentious move Senator Jacqui Lambie has offered an apology to the family and friends of Phillip Hughes. Scroll down for video . Senator Jacqui Lambie's sense of timing has been called into question after bringing Senate tributes to fallen cricketer Phillip Hughes to a halt to introduce a debate on defence pay . Phillip Hughes will be farewelled at a funeral to be held at his old high school in Macksville . She stated: 'Like the President of the Senate, I thought that Phillip Hughes’ condolence motion was finalised, so I proceeded with my attempt to suspend standing orders, so that I could debate my Legislation, which would have guaranteed that members of our ADF receive a pay rise.' The controversy coincided with Philip Hughes' funeral in his home town of Macksville on the NSW mid-north coast. After a few moments of confusion, the Senate agreed to finalise its tributes to Hughes with a minute's silence. Senator Lambie then moved to suspend all other business so that senators could debate her bill. The move was supported by Labor but was defeated 34-33. Senator Lambie's bill links ADF pay to that of politicians or CPI, whichever is greater. Controversy has followed Senator Jacqui Lambie in Canberra on Wednesday after she curtailed tributes to fallen cricketer Phillip Hughes to ignite a debate on defence pay . It follows her pledge to vote against all government legislation until the government reconsiders the 1.5 per cent defence pay increased. The government greeted Senator Lambie's move with hostility, initially denying her the right to speak. 'I'm asking you to give me a fair go and show me some courtesy,' she bellowed at government Senate leader Eric Abetz. 'This isn't about me, this is about the men and women who wear the uniform.' In her statement Ms Lambie added: 'It was the first time that I moved a suspension of standing orders - and it appears that some want to use the slight confusion created over the transition from one Senate procedure to another, against me. 'I apologise to Phillip Hughes’ family and friends if my misunderstanding over Senate procedure has offended them. This must be a very difficult and sad day for them. The speeches given in the Senate for Phillip were magnificent and inspirational.' Jacqui Lambie described Labor Senator John Faulkner's speech as particularly moving, speaking with 'eloquence, passion and compassion'.","Outrage at Jacqui Lambie's tactics to stop tributes to Phillip Hughes in the Senate to turn attention to a debate on defence pay .

"Parts of Britain face their coldest night of the year so far this week - with snow forecast and temperatures expected to plunge as low as -5C (23F). The Met Office said some rural areas across the country could see the mercury fall well past zero tonight, tomorrow night and on Friday evening. The predictions come as walkers in the Cairngorms enjoyed the deep winter snow yesterday and hopes of a white Christmas in the UK begin to rise. Scroll down for video . Snow could fall in parts of England by the end of the week as walkers enjoyed the first snow of winter in the Cairngorms in Scotland yesterday . Forecasters said showers could turn to sleet and wintry showers or light snow flurries by Friday, as temperatures are predicted to fall . Temperatures are expected to plunge to below freezing tomorrow, turning showers into sleet and possibly light snow flurries by Friday afternoon. Forecasters said there was a 'slim chance' snow could fall in parts of the Pennines and North Wales by the end of this week. There is also a possibility of wintry showers in exposed areas of the south as the mercury is expected to dip to as low as -2C (28F) in Bristol. And a minimum temperature of -5C (23F) is forecast for the Oxfordshire village of Benson overnight on Friday, according to the Met Office. Forecast Nicola Maxey said: 'On higher ground in the South there's a chance that we might see some sleet, and a slim chance of snow on Friday.’ Winter officially began on Monday, making the snow in the Cairngorms the first of the season. The Cairngorms, in the Scottish Highlands, are the snowiest place in the UK and have seen temperatures dip below freezing with the snow . An image of the funicular railway at Cairngorm shows snow has settled, but it is unlikely to lie in England . Walkers were pictured out enjoying the deep snow in the East Highlands, dubbed the snowiest place in Britain in a recent survey by the Met Office. The snow in Scotland led to warnings being issued by police about the dangers of driving on the A939 in the Cairngorms because of the recent snow and ice. And with forecasts of snow for the rest of England, comes a warning of plunging temperatures. The mercury is expected to remain at 6C (43F) to 7C (45F) - the average for December – throughout today, before falling by just a couple of degrees overnight to remain above freezing for most of England. A weak weather front brought rain to the South East last night, which was expected to move across East Anglia and up to the north and Scotland today. Tomorrow is expected to be much more cloudy and grey, with a chance of showers in the South East and Midlands. Forecasts of wintry weather and snow for England come as we near the end of a year that has recorded exceptionally mild months . Light dustings of snow could fall in Newcastle, North Wales and parts of the Pennines by Friday but the deep snow in Scotland is not expected . Hats, scarves and boots will be needed by the end of the week as temperatures are forecast to plummet as hopes for a white Christmas rise . By the evening temperatures are forecast to reach zero or just below freezing, particularly in Bristol and Newcastle. Forecasters said by Friday there will be more showers. Ms Maxey added: 'These could turn a bit wintry in exposed areas such as in Newcastle and the Pennines, but accumulations are unlikely. There is also a risk of fog patches.' Friday is expected to be a wetter and windier day, with stronger winds forecast for the North West. In the South East milder conditions are expected, with temperatures back to the average for December. A recent study by the Met Office found that snow has fallen 38 times in the last 52 years - meaning we can expect around half of our Christmases to be 'white.' Snow could be a welcome break for Londoners who were drenched by downpours throughout the city as temperatures remained at average . Commuters did their best to shield themselves from rain and cold blustery winds in the capital, while Scotland enjoyed the first snow of winter . The onset of the colder weather has led Public Health England to think about their health during the cold snap - 25,000 extra people usually die in England during winter, with the elderly particularly vulnerable. However the traditional festive image of trees dusted in white, is more likely to be confined to Christmas cards. Snow settling on the ground is much rarer, and has happened just four times in the last 51 years. Predictions of snow and falling temperatures this month follows after a mild autumn and exceptionally warm year, with each month this year apart from August seeing above-average temperatures. Commuters will also be hopeful that the Christmas season will not be a repeat of last year, when parts of England were drenched by heavy rain - leaving large parts of the Somerset Levels submerged for months.","Walkers enjoyed first snow of winter on the Cairngorms yesterday as hopes increased of a white Christmas .

"The wife of an alleged child molester held his hand and kissed him, reached out to him as he stood behind bars and led protests against his prosecution as he went on trial in Indonesia today. Tracy Bantleman's show of support for her husband Neil was transmitted across the world on the day he and an Indonesian colleague faced charges of abusing boys at Jakarta International School. Bantleman, a Canadian who worked as an administrator at the school, and his teaching assistant colleague Ferdinand Tjiong deny the charges in a wide-ranging case that has also seen cleaning staff accused of raping a young boy. Scroll down for video . Show of support: Canadian teacher Neil Bantleman, left, reaches out to his wife Tracy from inside a holding cell prior to the start of his trial hearing at South Jakarta District Court in Jakarta, Indonesia . Love and loyalty: Bantleman kisses his wife, while she caresses his hand, as he makes his way to the dock to officially face accusations of sexually abusing a six-year-old at a prestigious international school . Confidence: Mrs Bantleman smiles up at her husband. He and his co-accused have received strong support from the school and parents, and their lawyer suggested the case could be motivated by money . #freeNeilandFerdi: Mrs Bantleman talks with Siska Tjiong, wife of co-accused Indonesian teaching assistant Ferdinand Tjiong, during a rally to support their husbands outside the South Jakarta court . The allegations come after the revelation that a suspected serial paedophile sought by the FBI and believed to have abused scores of boys used to teach at the school. But Bantleman and Tjiong, who face up to 15 years in jail if found guilty, have received strong support from the school and parents, and their lawyer suggested the case could be motivated by money. Their wives led a crowd of about 60 supporters, mostly parents, who turned up outside the court waving banners that read 'Free Neil and Ferdi' and 'Reject the invented JIS case'. 'They are the victims of slander, we are 1,000 per cent sure. If they were really paedophiles, we would be the first to know,' said Maya Lestari, who has two children at the school and was helping to coordinate the rally. 'We're innocent,' Bantleman, 46, said from a holding cell at the court in the Indonesian capital before his trial. As he entered court, Tjiong said: 'I have come here to prove the truth, to end this slander.' Bantleman faces court: The men are being tried separately in closed-door sessions. A judge read the charges out against them in today's session. They were not required to enter a plea . Tjiong kisses his wife after his hearing: Hotman Paris Hutapea, a lawyer for both men, said the charges against them were vague and did not even specify an exact date when the crimes allegedly took place . The men are being tried separately in closed-door sessions. A judge read the charges out against them in today's session. They were not required to enter a plea. After the court hearings, Hotman Paris Hutapea, a lawyer for both men, said the charges against them were vague and did not even specify an exact date when the crimes allegedly took place. 'We assume this is motivated by money,' he said. 'If we uphold justice properly, how can you try a case when the prosecutors have no idea when the crime happened?' The family of one nursery school boy allegedly abused are suing the school and seeking $125 million in damages. The first allegation that cleaners had raped a nursery school boy emerged in April, after which more parents made abuse claims. The first trials began in August, with four male cleaners facing charges of child sex abuse, and a sixth suspect, a woman, accused of being an accomplice. Four of the men confessed then recanted, claiming police had beaten them into incriminating themselves. Their trials are still ongoing. The fifth male suspect committed suicide while in custody by drinking bathroom cleaner. Campaign: Tjiong holds up a paper bag emblazoned with a Twitter hashtag for supporters to use . In custody: Bantleman and Tjiong (C) are escorted by a policeman as they arrive at the South Jakarta court . Police and private security personnel stand guard at the main entrance of Jakarta International School, which was rocked by the revelation that a suspected serial paedophile worked there for a decade . At the South Jakarta District Court on Tuesday, Bantleman appeared in court first to hear the charges against him at the start of his trial. Tjiong appeared in court for a separate hearing after Bantleman. They are accused of abusing three young children at the school. Both hearings were held behind closed doors. Supports of Bantleman and Tjiong say the victim, who was six at the time the alleged abuse occurred, was subject to suggestive questioning by inexperienced police. The abuse was alleged to have happened at a room in the school during teaching hours. Mr Bantleman, who is from Burlington, Ontario, has been held in custody in Indonesia since his arrest on July 14. His family insist he is innocent and have called on Canadian authorities to lobby on his behalf. Jakarta International School is attended by the children of foreign diplomats, businesspeople and Indonesia's elite. It has 2,400 students aged three to 18 from about 60 countries. The school was shaken earlier this year when it emerged William Vahey, an American who taught at the school for ten years until 2002, killed himself as the FBI investigated allegations he sexually abused scores of teenage boys.","Neil Bantleman charged with abusing boys at Jakarta International School .

"Pictures have emerged of the youngest of four Western Sydney brothers who fled to Syria to fight for the Islamic State. Taha El Baf, 17, and his older siblings – two of whom weigh over 140kg and have been described as too unfit to be terrorist fighters – flew via Turkey to join the extremist group last month. The distraught father of the four brothers said he has not heard from them since receiving a text saying 'see you in paradise'. El Baf, who was in his final year of high school at Birrong Boys High School before he fled his family home in Yagoona, was a promising student and played for a local rugby league team, while his brothers had stable jobs. Scroll down for video . Taha El Baf, 17, from Yagoona, and his three older brothers flew to Syria to join the Islamic State last month . The 17-year-old also appeared in a school anti-bullying video which was posted to YouTube last year . Before they were due to come home last month, the parents received a text stating: 'We made it to Bilad al-Sham, we will see you in paradise'. Bilad al-Sham is a region in Syria. Despite the text, the parents went to the airport to pick up their sons but they never arrived. They now fear their boys have been lured into the clutches of the IS terrorist organisation. Their father Issam El Baf said he hadn't heard anything since receiving the haunting text. 'It's bad, very bad,' he said. 'It's very frustrating. We haven't heard anything for three weeks.' Authorities tracked the sons down in Turkey after the family alerted them but it is believed they have since crossed the border into Syria. More Australians have slipped through the cracks and fled overseas to join the fight with Islamic State . Unlike some before them, the siblings were 'clean-skins' and had not been on any watch-lists that would have alerted immigration controls. In a statement last month, their mother pleaded with them to come home. 'My sons, you are dear to us. You are good at heart. You have done nothing wrong. 'Come back. We love you.' Last month, leading Islamic community leader Dr Jamal Rifi said revealed two of the four Sydney brothers are 'obese' and may be snubbed by fellow terrorists if they eat all their rations. Dr Rifi said the men would not make good foot soldiers for the terror group, and believes they will be used for propaganda videos instead. When the brothers sent their shocked mother a one line text message saying they had arrived safely in Syria last month, she thought it was a cruel joke. Dr Jamal Rifi said  two of the brothers are over 140kg and would not make good foot soldiers for IS . The message read: 'We made it to Bilad al-Sham, we will see you in Paradise.' One of the brothers had initially told the mother that he won four tickets to Thailand and he was going to take his brothers with him. Dr Rifi told radio station 2UE: 'The family is distraught, their main concern is to initiate contact, the concern are not concerned how they were radicalised but that they want them to come back. 'We are hoping the fact that because two of them are quite obese they will not good foot soldiers, they are over 140 kg. 'People are going to realise what are we going to do with them? Are they going to eat al the food and you can't even run on the field.' Dr Rifi said the family was trying to get messages to the brothers but they had not responded and had probably had their mobile phones confiscated by IS. He explained the family had given all the information to the authorities who were trying to 'put the pieces of the puzzle together'. Their mother is of Lebanese descent and their father is a taxi driver, they also have another brother and sister living at home. Authorities argue they need more tools to monitor suspects and prevent them from being radicalised . Many foreign fighters have already left the country including Mohamed Elomar (pictured) Dr Rifi added they were 'simple boys' who could not organise trip properly, and he revealed they had missed the first flight they had booked and had to re-book one for the next day. He said: 'They have no life experience. They (the parents) had no idea what their kids were planning such a move, these are ordinary kids who live at home, they showed no sign of radicalisation.' The fifth son went to meet a flight that was coming in from Thailand last month, hoping it was a joke. Dr Rifi said the family had alerted the authorities to the brothers' departure and it was now up to them to 'put the pieces of the puzzle together'. It emerged on Saturday authorities had tracked the brothers - who lived in south-west Sydney - as far as Turkey and alerted the family last week. Australian Federal Police commissioner Neil Gaughan told a parliamentary committee that the group of four that managed to leave the country this week were 'not on anyone's radar',The Guardian reported. 'We got wind of it after the fact, but the fact is there are still people travelling,' said Gaughan, the national manager of counter-terrorism for the Australian Federal Police,' he said. Khaled Sharrouf is also fighting with IS militants in the Middle East, and made headlines when he posted a photo of his young son brandishing a severed head .","Four brothers from Sydney's south-west left Australia to fight in Syria .

"Two teenagers have been jailed for setting fire to a man's genitals with a home-made flame thrower, leaving him with third degree burns. Jordan Powell, 18, and Jack Rouse, 19, attacked a 19-year-old man, who has not been identified, in a flat in Hereford earlier this year.

Jordan Powell, 18 (left), and Jack Rouse, 19 (right) have been jailed for three-and-a-half years after they set fire to a man's genitals and legs with a home-made flamethrower during an overnight attack in Hereford . They had made the home-made flamethrower using an aerosol can and cigarette lighter and had been at a party with the man, before going back to Rouse's flat - where the attack took place. At a hearing at Worcester Crown Court Powell and Rouse were both jailed for three-and-a-half years after pleading guilty to assault causing grievous bodily harm. Their victim was said to be terrified during the attack, and suffered third degree burns to his legs and genital area after the horrific attack which took place at a flat in Hereford overnight on April 11 and 12. Detective Sergeant Tim Powell, of West Mercia Police, said: 'This is a particularly nasty attack and the sentencing has brought these two violent offenders to justice. Both teenagers were jailed for three-and-a-half years at a hearing at Worcester Crown Court . 'They conducted this horrific assault with intent to injure and terrorise the victim. I hope this result indicates West Mercia Police's priority of protecting people from harm.' Both men also received a further 18-month prison sentence after admitting a robbery of a 17-year-old man in Hereford on April 12. Police said their victim suffered 'significant facial injuries' as a result of the attack.

"What started as some complaints from neighbors has lead to a former NASCAR driver being locked up on several drug-related charges this week after allegedly being caught cooking meth. Robert Powell, 49, had been under investigation for some time after residents near his home in Goose Creek, South Carolina, reported suspicious activity. Powell competed in NASCAR’s Weekly Series from 1984 to 2002 winning 111 races in 328 starts at Summerville, Florence Motor and Myrtle Beach Speedways. However when police went through a garbage can that had been put on the curb for pick-up, what they found was enough to arrest the retired race car driver and his housemate, according to MS News Now.

"The parents of an 11-year-old Mexican boy who recently had portions of a watermelon-sized tumor removed will be allowed to stay in the U.S. while he receives treatment, authorities have confirmed. Federal immigration officials have granted Cindy and Jose Ramirez Sr. - the mother and father of Jose  Serrano - extended humanitarian visas after New Mexico Governor, Susana Martinez, sent a request. In a letter last week to Homeland Security, Martinez asked the federal authorities to expedite the couple's visas because they were important to their son's recovery. Scroll down for video . Family matters: Jose Serrano, right, 11, of Ciudad Juarez, Mexico, with his mother, Cindy  Ramirez (middle) Stable condition: Jose  (pictured) is recovering a week after an 11-hour surgery to remove a large portion of a massive tumor on his shoulder and neck . She wrote that they 'are a constant presence in Jose's small world inside the hospital and represent what is likely the only 'normal' things he experiences in the otherwise unfamiliar setting of a hospital in a country not his own.' Last month, a team of more than 25 medics from the University of New Mexico Hospital in Albuquerque expunged a third of the massive tumor from Jose during an 11-hour surgery. Doctors say he will need months of physical therapy, followed by more surgeries. Jose of Ciudad Juarez, Mexico, was diagnosed with venous lymphangioma on his shoulder in 2012. The cystic growth, which was rough to touch, extended across his shoulder and caused restricted movement. He could not swim because the water caused him pain and playing sports was difficult. The cystic growth, which was rough to touch, extended across his shoulder and caused restricted movement . Still smiling: He could not swim because the water caused him pain and playing sports was difficult . ‘It's been difficult,’ his mother explained before the mass was removed. ‘People stare at him. Some of them have these terrible, morbid looks on their faces.' When Jose was born with the growth doctors were concerned he wouldn't live, but he went on to make a stable recovery. However, as the mass continued to grow there was concern it could one day spread to his eyes and affect his vision. Doctors at the University of New Mexico Hospital told Jose that he had to undergo a series of surgeries and treatments to remove the huge fluid build up. In July 2012, U.S. Homeland Security Investigations assisted in picking up the boy and his parents from a neighborhood in Ciudad Juarez - one of the deadliest cities in the world due to drug cartels. Federal agents helped the family seek care for Jose after First Baptist Church of Rio Rancho members saw him during a missionary visit. After stories and images of the boy went viral, First Baptist Church officials reported a jump in donations to help him raise money for the surgeries, which cost more than $200,000. Martinez then got involved and sought an extended visa for the boy to receive treatment in New Mexico. His family had been traveling back and forth to visit while the boy stays with a staff member of the church.","Cindy and Jose Ramirez Sr. of Ciudad Juarez, Mexico, have been granted extended humanitarian visas for the U.S.

The crash saw the large lorry filled with liquid concrete collide with the car and then pin it against a wall in the city of Chaohu in eastern China's Anhui province. But not only were the two occupants of the car pulled from the wreckage alive, the also managed to survive without sustaining any serious injuries. Scroll down for video . The crash in eastern China's Anhui province saw a large lorry filled with liquid concrete crash head on with a car and pin it against a wall . Emergency workers were convinced the occupants of the car would not have survived the crash but they were pulled from the wreckage with barely a scratch . And after their lucky escape, rescue workers were left speechless that the pair were able to walk away. Emergency services worker Kong Mao said: 'When we got there and saw what was left of the car, we instantly assume that if there was anyone inside they must be dead. 'But then we heard someone call for help, and so we brought a crane in to move the cement mixer and ease the process of cutting the two people inside free. 'We were convinced they would probably have horrific injuries.

"Amateur radio - also called ham radio - operators were dealt a treat this weekend, when Russians aboard the ISS communicated with Earthlings. And one first-time enthusiast received a welcome surprise when, using a USB dongle and other equipment, he was able to receive the transmissions from the cosmonauts orbiting Earth. By analysing the bits of data they sent, he was able to piece together images and sounds from the space station that commemorated moments in Russia and the Soviet Union’s space history. Scroll down for a video of the sounds and to see how the image decoding is done . A ham radio operator from Poland has received images from the ISS. On Reddit he revealed his low-cost method to talk to cosmonauts. He used a USB dongle known as an RTL-SDR to receive sounds. When decoded these were revealed to be images of Russian space history (postcard of Yuri Gagarin shown) The amazing images were posted to Reddit by 22-year-old student Radoslaw Karwacki, from Poland. 'These images are not transmitted regularly. I was really lucky to receive them, because it was my first experience with this kind of equipment,' he told MailOnline. 'I blindly tuned in on that frequency during ISS flyby and happened to receive the signal.' Astronauts and cosmonauts on the station regularly communicate with people back on Earth using ham radio. Indeed, anyone with a radio licence and the right equipment can transmit to the crew and talk to them. A licence is not required to listen in, however. Construction of the ISS began on 20 November 1998. It supports a crew of up to six, with crews split into groups of three. The station orbits at a height of about 255 miles (410km). It has a total mass of about 990,000 pounds (450,000kg) and has living space roughly equivalent to a five-bedroom house. It completes an orbit of Earth every 92.91 minutes and moves at 17,100 miles (27,600km) per hour. It has now been in space for more than 5,900 days, during which time it has completed more than 92,000 orbits of Earth, and has been continuously occupied for more than 13 years. Over the weekend, the Russians decided to use a picture transmission method known as slow-scan television (SSTV) to relay images to Earth. In this instance the images included several of Yuri Gagarin, who became the first human in space on 12 April 1961 - and was born more than 80 years ago on 9 March 1934. Gagarin is seen in his spacesuit preparing for launch, while the rocket that took him to space - an evolution of which is still in operation today - was also transmitted with the images. 'I think it's a great way to commemorate the first person that went to space,' Mr Karwacki added. 'Having an international crew on the station all the time is something to really think about and appreciate. 'It shows that our civilisation can cooperate to achieve great things, and I'm sure that is something that will grow. 'And it's great that they still remember about their roots.' By listening to the transmitted sound broadcast on voice frequencies, receivers were able to decode the incoming messages and see the pictures the cosmonauts on the ISS decided to send. ‘Images are transmitted using the Slow Scan Television (SSTV) protocol,’ Mr Karwacki explained on imgur, where he posted the images. ‘Before the picture transmission started, I could hear an astronaut voice - ""This is Romeo Sierra Zero India Sierra Sierra"" - which is RS0ISS in the Nato phonetic alplabet. RS0ISS is the Russian callsign from the station, while the Americans used the callsign NA1SS when they communicate with ham operators. To receive the images and sounds, Mr Karwacki said he used an RTL-SDR USB dongle (shown), an antenna, the SDRSharp programme to receive the data and MMSTV software to decode it . Here is one of the images received by Mr Karwacki. The caption reads: '80 years since the birth of the first cosmonaut of the planet Earth - Y. A. Gagarin' To receive the images and sounds, Mr Karwacki said he used an RTL-SDR dongle, an antenna, the SDRSharp programme to receive the data and MMSTV software to decode it. The software is available free online, while such a dongle costs around £10 ($15). According to the website ISS Fan Club, the transmissions took place on Saturday 31 January and Sunday 1 February. In total 12 images were sent by the Russian ISS crew. To make contact, line-of-sight with the station is required, so ham radio operators  tune in when the ISS is flying over their location. ISS crew members often make unscheduled calls back to Earth with ham radios when they have a spare moment. And by picking up a few bits of equipment you, too, could listen and talk with the astronauts and cosmonauts on the station. Astronauts and cosmonauts on the International Space Station (pictured) regularly communicate with amateur radio - also known as ham radio - operators back on Earth .

"The Pennsylvania woman who stabbed her former-basketball-star husband to death in his sleep is on trial and her attorney claims she is insane. On Feb. 10, 2013, Maria Garcia-Pellon, 54, stabbed her husband of 25 years, Matthew White, with a kitchen knife as he slept. Garcia-Pellon has been charged with first- and third-degree murder as well as possession of an instrument of crime, according to the Philadelphia Inquirer. Insanity: Maria Garcia-Pellon, 54, admitted to stabbing her husband, former basketball star, Matthew White in the neck while he slept and now her defense attorney is claiming she is insane . Claims: Between 2001 and 2013, Garcia-Pellon has claimed that terrorists and the mafia were targeting her, the government was spying on her, and the Chinese hacked her phone and internet and were controlling everything . She admitted to killing White and reportedly told police she had done so because she caught him watching pornography -- particularly child pornography. Investigators found no evidence of any kind of pornography on White's computer . There is no doubt that she killed the former basketball star, who was the starting center for the University of Pennsylvania basketball team that reached the NCAA Final Four in 1979, according to ESPN. The matter in question is her sanity. The Huffington Post reports that after killing her husband, Garcia-Pellon changed her clothes and left their Nether Providence home. On Monday at her nonjury trial, Garcia-Pellon's family and friends recounted her unusual behavior leading up to the tragic incident. Her defense attorney, Thomas Bergstrom, took the Delaware County court judge on 'a trip through the depths of mental illness,' as he attempted to prove that Garcia-Pellon is guilty by reason of insanity or guilty but mentally ill. Friends and family spoke at the trial and traced Garcia-Pellon's, who has been diagnosed with bipolar disorder, paranoia, and schizoaffective disorder, mental illness back to 2001. Between 2001 and 2013, Garcia-Pellon has claimed that terrorists and the mafia were targeting her, the government was spying on her, and the Chinese hacked her phone and internet and were controlling everything, the Inquirer reports. Basketball Star: White was the starting center for the University of Pennsylvania that reached the NCAA Final Four in 1979. He was drafted by the Portland Trail Blazers  but ended up playing basketball in Europe . Bergstrom said, during the trial, that Garcia-Pellon first sought treatment in 2001 but began taking medication after she attempted suicide in 2007 and had to be hospitalized. He said the tragedy occurred after she stopped taking her medication. Forensic psychiatrists for both the defense and the prosecution determined that Garcia-Pellon did suffer a mental disorder, but disagreed about whether the elementary school teacher was aware at the time that what she did was wrong. A police affidavit states that when she was being taken into custody, Garcia-Pellon said, 'I caught him looking at pornography, young girls. I love kids. I had to do it,' according to the Post. White was drafted by the Portland Trail Blazers of the NBA but ended up playing basketball in Europe for 12 years where he met Garcia-Pellon.","Maria Garcia-Pellon, 54, admitted to stabbing her husband, former basketball star, Matthew White .

"The world spewed far more carbon pollution into the air last year than ever before, with emissions spurred largely by China, the United States and India. This is according to a recent report that estimated the world pumped 39.8 billion tons (36.1 billion metric tons) of carbon dioxide into the air last year by burning coal, oil and gas. That is 778 million tons (706 metric tons) or 2.3 per cent more than the previous year, despite increasingly urgent warnings over the need to curb greenhouse gases. Scroll down for video . The world pumped 39.8 billion tons (36.1 billion metric tons) of carbon dioxide into the air last year by burning coal, oil and gas. That is 778 million tons (706 metric tons) or 2.3 per cent more than the previous year, despite increasingly urgent warnings over the need to curb greenhouse gases . The report also said that China's per capita emissions had surpassed those of Europe for the first time, between 2013 and 2014. Experts said at current rates the 'quota' for the total amount of carbon dioxide that can be released into the atmosphere without pushing the world beyond 2°C of warming could be used up within 30 years. The report claims that the world is becoming committed to 'dangerous climate change' if it continues this trend. In order to keep temperatures from rising by more than 2°C above pre-industrial levels, beyond which the worst impacts of climate change will be felt, more than half the world's fossil fuel reserves may need to be left in the ground, they said. Emissions, which are primarily caused by burning fossil fuels, will have to decline by more than 5 per cent a year to give the world a 50/50 chance of keeping temperature rises below the 2°C threshold. China's emissions surpassed those of Europe for the first time, between 2013 and 2014, the report found . This map details some of the predicted affects of climate change in different continents.

Emissions will have to . decline by more than five per cent a year to give the world a 50/50 chance . of keeping temperature rises below the 2°C threshold. This . year's increase to 40 billion tonnes puts current global annual . emissions two-thirds above 1990 levels. China, the US, the European Union and . India are the world's largest emitters. Between them, they account for 58 . per cent of global carbon emissions and four-fifths of the growth in . carbon output in 2013. The UK's emissions were down 2.6 per cent, but over the longer term it 'exports' a third of its emissions. This is by consuming goods and services which are produced elsewhere and once these are taken into account its carbon output has merely stabilised. More than half of proven fossil fuel reserves may have to stay in the ground if governments are serious about a promise made in 2010 to limit a rise in average temperatures to 2°C (3.6°F) above pre-industrial times, the Global Carbon Project report by leading research institutes said. The stark warning that time is running out to tackle spiralling greenhouse gas emissions comes ahead of a UN summit in New York this week to drive action in the run-up to talks in Paris next year, where it is hoped a global climate deal can be secured. 'A break in current emission trends is urgently needed,' according to the report by experts in Britain, Norway, Switzerland, Austria, Australia, Germany and the Netherlands. Emissions by China alone, which overtook the United States as the number one carbon emitter in 2006 amid fast industrial growth, have soared to eclipse those of the United States and the European Union combined, it said. Professor Corinne Le Quere, director of the Tyndall Centre at the University of East Anglia (UEA), said: 'The human influence on climate change is clear. 'We need substantial and sustained reductions in CO2 emissions from burning fossil fuels if we are to limit global climate change. 'We are nowhere near the commitments necessary to stay below 2C of climate change, a level that will already be challenging to manage for most countries around the world, even for rich nations. 'Politicians meeting in New York need to think very carefully about their diminishing choices exposed by climate science.' Professor Le Quere is one of an international team of scientists from the Global Carbon Project, which has published the 'global carbon budget' analysis with a prediction for emissions in 2014 as well as an assessment for carbon dioxide output in 2013. This year's increase to 40 billion tonnes puts current global annual emissions two-thirds above 1990 levels, the year against which attempts to cut greenhouse gases are commonly measured. Historic and future carbon dioxide emissions must remain below a total of 3,200 billion tonnes to make it likely temperature rises do not exceed 2°C, the experts said, but 2,000 billion tonnes of the quota had already been used up. The report comes just a day after huge number protest for greater action against climate change during the People's Climate March on September 21, 2014 in New York City . At current rates the quota for the total amount of carbon dioxide that can be released into the atmosphere without pushing the world beyond 2°C of warming could be used up within 30 years . On current rates the rest of the budget could be used up in 30 years, they said. China, the US, the European Union and India are the world's largest emitters and between them account for 58 per cent of global carbon emissions and four-fifths of the growth in carbon output in 2013, the annual analysis said. Last year China's emissions grew by 4.2 per cent, the US's carbon output was up 2.9 per cent, India's emissions grew 5.1 per cent, but the EU's emissions fell 1.8 per cent. The UK's emissions were down 2.6 per cent, but over the longer term it 'exports' a third of its emissions by consuming goods and services which are produced elsewhere and once these are taken into account its carbon output has merely stabilised. Emissions per person in China outstripped the EU for the first time, with emissions of two tonnes per person, compared to Europe's 1.9 tonnes, although the EU, like the UK, exports around a third of its emissions to places such as China. Projected temperature change from 2081-2100. For the first time, the report connects hotter global temperatures to hotter global tempers. Top scientists are saying that climate change will complicate and worsen existing global security problems, such as civil wars, strife between nations and refugees . Globally emissions are expected to increase at a higher rate in 2014 than they did in 2013, when carbon dioxide output rose 2.3 per cent. Professor Pierre Friedlingstein from the University of Exeter said: 'We have already used two-thirds of the total amount of carbon we can burn, in order to keep warming below the crucial 2°C level. 'If we carry on at the current rate, we will reach our limit in as little as 30 years' time - and that is without any continued growth in emission levels. 'The implication of no immediate action is worrying clear - either we take a collective responsibility to make a difference, and soon, or it will be too late.' UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon will host a summit on September 23 of more than 120 world leaders, hoping for 'bold pledges' as part of work on a U.N. deal due to be agreed in Paris at the end of 2015 to limit global warming.","The report estimated the world pumped 39.8 billion tons of CO2 last year .

"Fears the end of the Mayan calendar predicts the end of the world this coming December have run rife on the internet in recent years. Less well known is the rumour that one particular mountain in south-west France will burst open on that day revealing an alien spaceship which will carry nearby humans to safety. Well, if you were counting on that possibility to save you from the apocalypse, prepare to be disappointed. French officials have banned access to the Pic de Bugarach to avoid a rush of New Age fanatics, sightseers and, above all, journalists. The Pic de Bugarach, south-west France: Online rumours claim that on December 21 the mountain will burst open to reveal an alien spaceship that will rescue those nearby from the apocalypse . A hundred police and firefighters will also control approaches to the tiny village of the same name at the foot of the mountain, and if too many people turn up, they will block access there too. Believers say the world will end on December 21, 2012, the end date of the ancient Mayan calendar, and they see Bugarach as one of a few sacred mountains sheltered from the cataclysm. Eric Freysselinard, France's top official in the area, told AFP: 'We are expecting a few visionaries, a few people who believe in this end of the world, but in extremely limited numbers. 'We are expecting greater numbers of people who are just curious, but in numbers we cannot determine. Above all, we are expecting lots of journalists.' Expectations: With the Aztec Mayan calendar, pictured, ending on or around December 21 some fear it means the people believed it to be the end of the world . No-go zone: French officials have banned access to the Pic de Bugarach, in south-west France, to avoid a rush of New Age fanatics . Films, documentaries and websites have . promoted the idea that the ancient Mayan calendar, which is made up of . 394-year periods called baktuns, predicts that doomsday is on December . 21. Experts estimate the system starts . counting at 3114 B.C., and will have run through 13 baktuns, or 5,125 . years, around December 21. They say 13 was a significant number . for the Maya, and the end of that cycle would be a milestone — but they . have been keen to stress that it does not mark an end. Conspiracy theorists nonetheless . believe the Maya may have been privy to impending astronomical disasters . that would coincide with 2012, ranging from explosive storms on the . surface of the sun that could knock out power grids to a galactic . alignment that could trigger a reversal in Earth's magnetic field. The culture ministry in Guatemala - . where half the population are of Mayan descent - is hosting a massive . event in the capital just in case the world actually does end, while . tour groups are promoting doomsday-themed getaways. Culture's remains: The Mayan temple at Xunantunich, Belize is seen where the people's culture of writing, astronomy and temple complexes flourished from years 300 to 900 . But the country's Maya alliance . Oxlaljuj Ajpop accuses the government and tour groups of perpetuating . the myth that their calendar foresees the imminent end of the world for . monetary gain. It issued a statement last month . saying that the new Maya time cycle simply 'means there will be big . changes on the personal, family and community level, so that there is . harmony and balance between mankind and nature.' In September Mexican government . archaeologist Alfredo Barrera said that the Maya tried to make . predictions, but perhaps about more humdrum events like droughts or . disease outbreaks. Big plans: Arguing Mayan prophecies beyond 2012, king of Palenque, K'inich Hanaab Pakal, pictured, said he would return to Earth a couple thousands years from now in the future . 'The Mayas did make prophecies, but . not in a fatalistic sense, but rather about events that, in their . cyclical conception of history, could be repeated in the future,' said . Barrera, of the National Institute of Anthropology and History. Experts have stressed that the ancient . Maya, whose 'classic' culture of writing, astronomy and temple . complexes flourished from the year 300 to 900, were extremely interested . in future events, far beyond Dec. 21. 'There are many ancient Maya monuments . that discuss events far into the future from now,' wrote Geoffrey . Braswell, an anthropologist at the University of California at San . Diego. 'The ancient Maya clearly believed things would happen far into . the future from now.' 'The king of Palenque, K'inich Hanaab . Pakal, believed he would return to the Earth a couple of thousand years . from now in the future,' Dr Braswell wrote in an email to The Associated . Press. 'Moreover, other monuments discuss events even before the . creation in 3114 B.C.' Only a couple of references to the . 2012 date equivalency have been found carved in stone at Maya sites, and . neither refers to an apocalypse, experts say. Such apocalyptic visions have been . common for more than 1,000 years in Western, Christian thinking, and are . not native to Maya thought. 'This is thinking that, in truth, has . nothing to do with Mayan culture,' said Alexander Voss, an . anthropologist at the University Of Quintana Roo, a state on Mexico's . Caribbean coast. 'This thing about looking for end-times is not . something that comes from Mayan culture.' Dr Braswell compared the Maya . calendar, with its system of cycles within cycles, to the series of . synchronized wheels contained in old, analogue car odometers. 'The Maya long count system is like a . car odometer,' Braswell wrote. 'My first car (odometer) only had six . wheels so it went up to 99,999.9 miles.

"Janusz Skalski, a doctor at the children's hospital in Krakow, said the boy's temperature was 12C and his heart was beating only once every few dozen seconds when he was brought in on Sunday . A two-year-old boy is fighting for his life after spending a bleak night nearly naked outdoors in southern Poland. Janusz Skalski, a doctor at the children's hospital in Krakow, said the boy's temperature was 12C and his heart was beating only once every few dozen seconds when he was brought in on Sunday. Medics have managed to raise child's temperature to 36C - nearly normal - and a regular hearbeat has been restored, said Dr Skalski. However, the boy, named only as Adam, is still in a medically induced coma and the condition of his brain remains to be seen. He is still attached to a respirator, but his kidneys, liver, intestines and lungs are said to be working properly. Police officer Michal Godyn found Adam on Sunday face down in a pile of leaves beneath a tree next to a creek in the village of Raclawice, north-east of Krakow, after he was reported missing. The temperature had fallen to minus-7C overnight. He was wearing just socks and a pyjama top. 'I cleared the leaves off his face and carried him in my arms to the nearest house,' where an ambulance was called, Officer Godyn told the Fakt daily. Adam and two other children had been spending Saturday night under his grandmother's care. The woman said she did not see him leave, but the house was not locked, according to Officer Godyn. Adam was found a few hundred yards from her house, in the direction of his home, Officer Godyn said. Medics at the children's hospital in Krakow, Poland, have managed to raise child's temperature to 36C - nearly normal - and a regular hearbeat has been restored. The boy nearly froze to death overnight . Doctors began discontinuing anaesthesia to slowly bring Adam out of medically induced coma today. They are waiting for the slightest movement of a finger or hand to give them a signal that his nervous system is still functioning. Polish media report that if Adam survives his ordeal it will be a world first. So far the lowest body temperature of anybody saved from hypothermia is 13.7C, Dr Skalski was quoted as saying. However, Dr Skalski insisted the boy's recovery remains in doubt. 'It would be an absolute miracle if the child could be saved with no negative side effects,' he said.","Boy named as Adam was found wearing only socks and a pyjama top .

"Three-time African player of the year Yaya Toure joined actor Idris Elba and a host of international footballers to launch a public awareness campaign to help halt West Africa's Ebola epidemic and recognise the health workers fighting the deadly disease. The worst Ebola outbreak on record has killed more than 6,000 people in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia, the three countries worst affected by the epidemic. The Africa United campaign, unveiled ahead of the African Cup of Nations draw in Equatorial Guinea's capital Malabo on Wednesday, broadcasts information on the disease and how to stop it spreading in French, English, Krio and other local languages. Yaya Toure is backing the new campaign against Ebola in the run-up to the African Cup of Nations . Actor Idris Elba, whose parents are from Sierra Leone and Ghana, said the appeal was personally important . Messages will be sent out to the three countries and their neighbours via television, radio, billboards and phone text messages, said organisers. Manchester City midfielder Toure hails from Ivory Coast, which shares borders with three countries hit by the disease but has so far been spared. The Africa United campaign was launched this week to help fight Ebola before the African Cup of Nations . 'I could not sit back without doing something to help fight Ebola,' said Toure. '(The campaign) pays tribute to the many, many African heroes who are in the villages, towns and cities using their skills, resourcefulness and intelligence to battle Ebola.' Elba, who came to fame in TV series The Wire and played Nelson Mandela in the biopic Mandela: Long Walk to Freedom, said the campaign had a special resonance to him. 'For me the battle against Ebola is a personal one,' said Elba, whose parents are from Sierra Leone and Ghana. 'To see those amazing countries in West Africa where my father grew up and my parents married being ravaged by this disease is painful and horrific.' In one of the campaign's spots, Elba plays a football coach giving a halftime talk during West Africa's 'life or death' match against Ebola and passing on tips on how to spot the disease and prevent new infections. In another,  Toure is joined by fellow footballers Carlton Cole, Kei Kamara, Patrick Vieira, Fabrice Muamba and Andros Townsend pay homage to the work of frontline healthcare workers by wearing their names on the backs of their jerseys. The campaign was backed by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Foundation.

"Parenting website BabyCenter has released its list of Top 100 Baby Names of 2014, and just like last year, it's Sophia for a girl and Jackson for a boy. But a number of more obscure baby names such as Garrett and Galina are fast-climbing the ranks - character names from House of Cards and Orange Is the New Black respectively - and BabyCenter has put this trend down to the 'Netflix effect.' 'This is the year of the binge-watching baby name,' said the site's global editor in chief, Linda Murray. 'When you spend 16 hours in one weekend binge-watching your favorite series, you can’t help but fall in love with the characters’ names.' Binge-watching baby names: While the top three names for boys and girls have remained the same as last year, the biggest trend for rising monikers in 2014 appears to be related to popular TV shows . Based on the names of more than 400,000 babies born in 2014 to moms registered to the site, the top three names haven't moved since last year. Sophia, Emma, then Olivia top the girls list for the third year in a row, while Jackson, Aiden and Liam hold their own at the top of the boys list for the second year running. The correlation between baby names which are shooting up in popularity, however, and current trending 'binge-watch shows' is undeniable, according to Ms Murray. Nearly 20 percent of moms surveyed on their naming tactics found inspiration from TV show characters, and 16 percent looked to actors and actresses for great baby name ideas. 1. Sophia . 2. Emma . 3.

On the 2014 boys list, Frank is up 19per cent from 2013, Garrett is up 16per cent and Remy is up 11per cent; while for girls, Claire is up 14per cent and Zoe is up 13per cent. And parents aren't just being influenced by character names, they're looking to the actors too. Robin Wright, who plays Claire in House of Cards, may also be responsible for a 12per cent popularity spike for the name 'Robin' and a whopping 65per cent spike for the name 'Wright.' Orange Is the New Black character names, primarily girls of course, also saw a rise in popularity this year. Galina is up 67per cent, Nicky is up 35per cent, Piper is up 28per cent and Dayanara is up 19per cent from 2013. TV: The name Frank, shared by Kevin Spacey's character in House of Cards (center left) enjoyed a 19per cent rise in popularity  this year, while Claire, shared by Robin Wright's character (center right) was up 14per cent .

ABC's Nashville may have contributed to a surge in names including Luke, up 44per cent, Avery, up 25per cent, Deacon, up 22per cent, Daphne, up 15per cent and Gunnar, up 14per cent. Jackson, this year's top boys baby name, is a moniker shared by Grey's Anatomy character Dr Jacson Avery, who made his entrance in the show's sixth season. But other character names from the show including Arizona, Callie, Miranda and Owen have seen an increase in popularity on this year's list. Disney's Frozen seems to have pushed the name Elsa up by 29per cent since 2013, while the voice behind the animated character, Idina Menzel, may be the reason for 'Idina' making its way onto the 2014 list for the first time, having not appeared on the 2013 list. Real-life: The name Elsa, shared by Disney's much-adored Frozen character (left) is up 29per cent since 2013, while the name 'Idina' made its debut on the list this year and is shared by Elsa's voice, Idina Menzel (right) Looking to TV for baby naming inspiration, or formally to the Silver Screen, is nothing new. The name 'Marilyn', for example, saw a rise in popularity at the height of actress Marilyn Monroe's fame in the 50s and 60s, and hasn't picked up steam again since after her death, according to BabyNamesHub. But for parents who aren't binge-watching TV this year, perhaps they're traveling instead. 'Destination names' accounted for the other major 2014 trend, according to BabyCenter. One in four parents who were 'undecided' on a baby name said they would consider the name of a place they associate with 'special memories.' Everest was up 70per cent for boys and 21 per cent for girls, Verona was up 58 percent, and Bronx rose 34 percent.","Sophia, Emma and Olivia are the most popular girls baby names  for the third year running on BabyCenter's list .

"An executive headteacher of a primary academy took home a salary in excess of £200,000 last year after being handed a massive pay rise meaning he now earns more than the Prime Minister, official accounts show. Sir Greg Martin, executive head of Durand Academy in Stockwell, south London, saw his salary rise by around 56 per cent in 2013 to a total of £200,822 – thanks to a loophole which allows the salary increase due to the fact he runs several schools. In addition to his salary, Mr Martin, who was knighted in last year's birthday honours for services to education, also received £28,316 in pension contributions last year. Sir Greg Martin, executive head of Durand Academy in Stockwell, south London, saw his salary increase by around 56 per cent in 2013 to a total of £200,822 . Combined with his salary, this took his overall remuneration package for 2013 to £229,138. In comparison, David Cameron earns around £142,500. Durand Academy – a state run publicly-funded school – said Mr Martin’s role as executive head was ‘hugely demanding’ and said governors were ‘privileged to retain his services’. However, the National Union of Teachers said it was ‘remarkably hard’ to see how the 56.5 per cent pay rise could be justified. Durand Academy is a state academy - a school that is not under local council control and has freedom over areas such as curriculum and staff pay - and is run by the Durand Academy Trust. It was judged to be good by Ofsted following an inspection in December. Durand Academy - which is state run and publicly-funded - said Mr Martin's role was 'hugely demanding' and said governors were 'privileged to retain his services'. Pictured: Durand Academy Junior School . Education Secretary Michael Gove, pictured, has previously visited Durand Academy School in Stockwell, south London, which was judged to be good by Ofsted following an inspection in December . It caters for five-to-11-year-olds, has a middle school for 12-to-13-year-olds and an early-years centre for under-fives. The school is currently attempting to set up a state secondary boarding school for 13-to-18-year-olds in West Sussex. Figures included in the Trust's annual accounts for 2013 show that Mr Martin’s salary rose 56.5 per cent from £128,322 in 2012. The document also shows that Nathalie Parker, the academy's acting headteacher, was given a salary of between £115,000 and £120,000 last year. Data published by the Department for Education last month shows that the average salary for a leadership teacher in a primary academy stands at £53,000. A Durand Academy spokesman said: ‘Durand's Executive Head does not just run a primary school, but now oversees an Early Years school, a Junior School, a Middle School which opened in September 2012 and also leads the development of Durand's pioneering plans for a state boarding school for its intake in West Sussex. Figures included in Durand Academy Trust's annual accounts for 2013 show that Mr Martin’s salary rose 56.5 per cent to £200,822 in 2013. In comparison, Prime Minister David Cameron, right, earns around £142,500 . ‘With more than 1,000 children being educated across three school sites, it is a hugely demanding role and Governors are proud and privileged to retain the services of such an experienced and dedicated education leader. ‘Children's outstanding attainment in this year's SATs is testament to his enduring positive impact.’ However, Christine Blower, general secretary of the National Union of Teachers (NUT) said: ‘It is remarkably hard to see how this can possibly be justified in a publicly funded school when those employed in the public sector are still restricted to a 1 per cent pay rise.’","Durand Academy executive head received 56 per cent pay rise last year .

"Social events which inevitably involve a glass of wine or a gin and tonic can be a nightmare for those avoiding alcohol. But new research shows tee-totallers have come up with various ways of getting out of drinking without arousing suspicion from their colleagues.. From volunteering to be the designated driver to pretending they are trying to lose weight, a study found workers use such excuses as they don't want to be seen as a 'holier-than-thou' non-drinker. Scroll down for video . From pretending they are on a diet to saying alcohol gives them migraines, a study found non-drinkers use excuses to get out of drinking as they feared being perceived as judgemental or 'holier-than-thou' 'Drinking can be a big part of workplace culture, and being viewed as an outsider for any reason can hurt you professionally,' said the study's lead author Dr Lynsey Romo, of North Carolina State University. 'In our study, we interviewed successful professionals who don't drink,' Dr Romo said. 'We found they felt being a non-drinker was a form of deviance.' However workers reported they didn't want to miss out on the career opportunities that come from networking and socialising. Sometimes, attending  functions was a  requirement of their job. 'Non-drinkers developed a variety of strategies to attend social events without making themselves, their co-workers, or their clients feel uncomfortable,' Dr Romo added. The researchers found most non-drinkers didn't announce the fact that they were not drinking because they didn't want to draw attention to themselves. While some would answer honestly if asked, many declined a drink in ways that made their non-drinking ambiguous. Using health-related excused like 'alcohol gives me migraines'. Buying a drink but then not drinking it. Buying a round of drinks for colleagues. Saying 'I've got an early morning' or 'I'm not drinking tonight instead of 'I don't drink' Pretending you are trying to lose weight. Volunteering to be the designated driver. For example, instead of saying 'I don't drink,' they said things like 'I'm not drinking tonight' or 'I've got an early morning'. Not wanting to be seen as judgemental or 'holier-than-thou', some would buy an alcoholic drink but not drink it, in order to fit in with their colleagues. If colleagues twigged that they weren't drinking, some non-drinkers would find ways to show they didn't have a problem with drinking by buying a round of drinks, or volunteering to be the designated driver. Others tried to use humour to defuse any social tension. Other non-drinkers would use socially acceptable 'excuses' for not drinking to avoid being seen as judgemental. For example, one professional who didn't drink because he wanted to set a good example for his children told co-workers that he didn't drink because he was trying to lose weight. Similarly, another professional, who didn't drink because she was taking prescription drugs to deal with a mental-health issue, told co-workers that alcohol gave her migraines. The research shows there is perceived pressure to conform to social norms in the workplace, the researchers argued. Some workers would buy a drink and then not drink it, while others said they had to get up early the next day. Another known trick is to order a clear drink which can imitate an alcoholic drink like gin and tonic . 'This work highlights a challenge facing many non-drinking adults,' Dr Romo said. 'It's something that organisations and HR departments may want to take into consideration. HR departments who have historically been worried about problem drinkers, should also consider the needs of non-drinkers, she added. They should make sure non-alcoholic beverages are available at happy hours or host social activities that don't centre around drinking, she said. She concluded: 'If employers want their employees to achieve their full potential, they need to foster an environment that encourages their employees to be themselves.' The research was published online the Journal of Applied Communication Research.","Non-drinkers use an array of methods to avoid alcohol at work events .

"A Mediterranean diet increases life expectancy by protecting the DNA from damage, research shows. Harvard academics studied 4,676 middle-aged women comparing their typical eating habits with the make-up of their cells. Importantly, they looked at their telomeres – biological caps which are found at the ends of chromosomes that protect the DNA inside. The Mediterranean diet is rich in fruits, vegetables, pulses, whole grains, fish and olive oil with little red or processed meat - and may help protect our DNA from damage, new research suggests . As we get older, our telomeres get progressively shorter, causing the DNA to become damaged and raising the odds of age-related illnesses such as Alzheimer' s, diabetes and heart disease. The research – published in the BMJ – found that women whose diets were generally low in fat and high in fruit and veg had longer telomeres. But this was even more pronounced for those who followed a Mediterranean diet rich in fruit, veg, nuts and pulses. Marta Crous-Bou, the lead author from the Brigham and Women's hospital in Boston, the US, said that it may be due to antioxidants in fruit, veg and nuts – chemicals that prevent ill health and aging. She said: 'Our findings showed that healthy eating, overall, was associated with longer telomeres. 'However, the strongest association was observed among women who adhered to the Mediterranean diet.' Dr Immaculata De Vivo, associate professor at the Harvard School of Public Health said: 'Our results further support the benefits of adherence to this diet to promote health and longevity. 'To our knowledge this is the largest population-based study specifically addressing the association between Mediterranean diet adherence and telomere length in healthy, middle-aged women, . Women whose diets were low in fat and high in fruit and veg had longer telomeres - biological caps on chromosomes that protect the DNA inside . 'Our results further support the benefits of adherence to this diet to promote health and longevity.' Previous research by Harvard University last year involving 10,000 showed that women who followed a Mediterranean diet were 40 per cent to live beyond the age of 70. They were also far less likely to develop chronic diseases including diabetes, heart disease, Alzheimer's or Parkinson's disease. The Mediterranean diet is rich in fruits, vegetables, pulses, whole grains, fish and olive oil with little red or processed meat. Dr Mike Knapton, Associate Medical Director at the British Heart Foundation, said: 'This large study adds to the body of evidence that longer telomeres are found in those who eat a Mediterranean diet. 'Longer telomeres may partially explain the link between diet and risk of cardiovascular disease. 'Previous findings from the same study had shown that those with unhealthy lifestyles had shorter telomeres. 'These results reinforce our advice that eating a balanced and healthy diet can reduce your risk of developing heart disease.' The Mediterranean diet not only improves heart health but it could help male impotence. Researchers found men with erectile dysfunction who adopted the diet - involving eating fruit, veg, pasta, olive oil and nuts daily but few dairy products or red meat - may reduce their chances of having a heart attack or stroke. However, patients with erectile dysfunction who failed to stick to the Mediterranean diet had more vascular and cardiac damage. Greek Doctor Athanasios Angelis, who presented his findings at the annual meeting of the European Association of Cardiovascular Imaging in Austria, said: 'Erectile dysfunction is not a symptom of ageing, it is a bad sign from the body that something is wrong with the vasculature. Men men with erectile dysfunction who adopted the diet - involving eating fruit, veg, pasta, olive oil and nuts daily but few dairy products or red meat - may reduce their chances of having a heart attack or stroke . 'In 80 per cent of cases, erectile dysfunction is caused by vascular problems and is a warning that patients are at increased risk of a heart attack or stroke.' He added: 'The Mediterranean diet is associated with lower cardiovascular events and could be a way to help erectile dysfunction patients lower their risk. 'We wanted to investigate whether patients with erectile dysfunction who follow this diet have less vascular and cardiac damage.' The study included 75 men with erectile dysfunction, average age 56, who attended the Department of Cardiology at Hippokration Hospital in Athens. Dr Angelis said: 'Patients with erectile dysfunction who had unhealthy diets had more vascular and cardiac damage than those who followed the Mediterranean diet. Good sources of monounsaturated fat - such as macadamia nuts - can help men with erectile dysfunction avoid a heart attack . 'Previous studies have shown that patients with erectile dysfunction have vascular damage, but we found that the heart is also damaged. 'This may help to further explain why these patients are more prone to cardiovascular events. 'The formation of atheroma, the stiffening of the arteries, and the poor functioning of the heart can eventually lead to a cardiac event.' He added: 'Our findings suggest that adopting the Mediterranean diet can improve the cardiovascular risk profile of patients with erectile dysfunction and may reduce their chances of having a heart attack or stroke. This needs to be tested in a larger study. 'Really simple changes in our diet may help a lot, for example using olive oil which contains monounsaturated fat. 'If someone doesn't have the money to buy some of the foods they can substitute them with others, for example nuts are a good source of monounsaturated fat. 'Sometimes it's difficult to adopt something if you consider that it's part of a prescription, but the Mediterranean diet is not a prescription, it's a lifestyle. 'It's about having an awareness of what foods are healthy or unhealthy.' He concluded: 'Patients who have erectile dysfunction and don't adhere to the Mediterranean diet have vascular and cardiac damage and are at increased risk of heart attack and stroke. 'Our findings suggest that adopting a healthy diet can reduce that risk. We also advise patients to stop smoking, exercise and ensure that they have healthy levels of blood pressure and lipids.'","The diet is rich in fruits, vegetables, pulses, whole grains, fish and olive oil .

"Emmanuel Petit has condemned apathy in France towards Thierry Henry and claimed the country would be better under German rule. A former team-mate of Henry at Monaco, Arsenal and in the French national team, Petit described the prevailing attitude towards the striker as 'hypocritical and cowardly'. Henry is leaving the New York Red Bulls and may have played his final match, with the 37-year-old yet to open up about his future plans. Emmanuel Petit has launched a vigorous defence of his former France and Arsenal team-mate Thierry Henry . Henry wipes away the tears as his statue is unveiled outside Arsenal's Emirates Stadium . He has been immediately linked with a return to a non-playing role at Arsenal, the club at which he enjoyed his best success during an eight-year spell. It has been suggested that Henry should be afforded one last outing for France, as a farewell match, and Petit, 44, can see the merit but suspects he is in a minority. 'Why not, but people don't like Thierry Henry,' Petit said in an interview with the French website sports.fr. 'In England, he has a statue. That says a lot. He is revered over there. 'How can you reproach Thierry Henry? His handball against Ireland? It helped us qualify for the World Cup in South Africa. He's done nothing wrong. France is hypocritical and cowardly. 'Sometimes I say to myself that having been invaded by the Germans, we would be better led today.' Henry handles the ball in the build-up to France's crucial goal in their play-off tie against Ireland in 2009 . Petit (back row, second right) and Henry (front row, far left) pose for a France team photo in 1998 . Petit immediately faced criticism for appearing to confer praise on Nazi Germany, which invaded France during the Second World War. But he told Yahoo Sport he had only intended to comment on modern-day Germany. 'Germany shows us today that it is better than us, politically, economically and in a sporting sense, and I didn't mean to say anything else,' Petit said. 'But I can never stop people from making amalgamations. The Germany that I like, it is that of today. Don't make me say what I wasn't thinking.' Petit stressed Henry, a 1998 World Cup and Euro 2000 winner, deserves a profile more in tune with his achievements. 'This bad image of Thierry Henry annoys me,' Petit said in the sports.fr interview. 'The press never criticises itself, never goes back and never excuses itself. ' Petit and Henry pictured together in Arsenal's 2-1 victory over Lens in the second leg of their UEFA Cup clash . Petit likened Henry's treatment in France to the way Wayne Rooney is perceived in England. 'Wayne Rooney isn't hated in England even though he hasn't always shown a stiff upper lip on and off the pitch,' Petit said. 'Thierry Henry has never made any bad gestures on the pitch and has no history in his private life. 'He got screwed by the French press after his handball, and since then he does not speak to the French (media). 'But look, he speaks very well to the British media. He was an expert during the World Cup on the BBC, he enjoyed it because he loves football. 'In France he has no relationship with the press, so what? Maybe because he wasn't smiling when he scored for Les Bleus. There you are, that's what I hate in this country.

"Despite pleading guilty to a string of child sex offences, a wealthy New South Wales businessman has avoided jail and been able to walk free on bail. Last week, it was found that, 59 year old Maurice Van Ryn, was granted bail at Bega local court after pleading guilty to a charge involving multiple sexual and indecent assaults on children. Nine's A Current Affair described the former CEO of Bega Cheese as one of the richest men in the small seaside town of Tathra, on the NSW far south coast and nearby Bega. Scroll down for video . Maurice Van Ryn (pictured) has walked free on bail despite pleading guilty to a string child sex offences . Nine's ACA launched a special investigation that found the wealthy businessman was responsible for 10 years of abusing children . ACA says he committed indecent acts against children in a home. This went on for about 10 years until in June, an eight year old girl came forward, telling her parents she had been abused by Van Ryn. When Greg Otton, a friend of Van Ryn's neighbour heard the news, it's believed he spread the word throughout the community which then led to six more victims, both boys and girls, coming forward. 'incredible brave young woman, a credit to her parents they could raise her to react in the way she did at such a young age,' said Mr Otton. He says bail laws are inadequate allowing 'creeps to walk the streets' and believes the justice system is broken and needs fixing. Local Greg Otton (pictured) told ACA he spread the news of the abuse to the community which led to six more victims coming forward . Maurice Van Ryn (pictured left) was the former Bega Cheese CEO and was known around town as the 'big cheese' In Bega local court last week, Van Ryn pleaded guilty to 12 child sex offences. But they were rolled into a more serious offence, 'persistent sexual abuse of a child', one of the country's worse child sex offences that carries the same penalty as murder, a maximum of 25 years behind bars. He was then committed to the District Court for sentencing in February next year. ACA also uncovered that Van Ryn also committed one of the offences in July, while on bail, citing the former corporate high flyer is taking the justice system for a ride. Child protection advocate Heddy Johnston told ACA she was appalled at how the case was handled.

"It's been branded as a 'suicidal mission' that may not deliver on its promises. Despite this, the controversial Mars One project - which aims to send people to live on the red planet - has whittled down its shortlist of candidates from 200,000 to just 663. From this, a final crew of four will be eventually be selected for a 'one-way ticket' to Marsm scheduled to arrive in 2025 following a gruelling seven-month journey from Earth. Scroll down for video . The Mars One project has whittled down its shortlist of candidates to just 663 from 200,000 entries. This number will be reduced to 24 in the final rounds. Pictured is an artist's concept of a potential colony on Mars. The time frame for this next stage depends how long it takes the team to sort through the 663 . Additional teams would join the settlement every two years, with the intention that by 2033 there would be over twenty people living and working on Mars. There, they will collect data, plant oxygen-producing vegetation and set the foundation for human colonisation. The majority of the 663 applicants - the full list can be viewed here - come from the US, with India and China coming in second and third place. In spite of the risks, more than 200,000 people from around the world applied when the Netherlands-based group called for volunteers to join the mission. In the next stage, which may involve 'rigorous, potentially televised competitions', the current shortlist will be reduced to 24.

Chris Hadfield, former commander of the ISS, recently said that the mission may not deliver on this promise. 'There's a great, I don't know, self-defeating optimism in the way that this project has been set up,' he warned . In spite of the risks, more than 200,000 people from around the world applied when the Netherlands-based group called for volunteers to join the mission. An artist illustration of a communication satellite on Mars is pictured. The satellite is part of the wider Mars One mission set to launch in January 2018 . Chris Hadfield, former commander of the ISS, recently told Elmo Keep, writing in Medium that the mission may not deliver on this promise. 'There's a great, I don't know, self-defeating optimism in the way that this project has been set up,' Hadfield told Medium. The Mars One project plans to launch a supply mission to land on Mars as soon as October 2016. A ‘settlement rover’ will then land in 2018. The landing systems will be tested eight times before they are used to transport humans - a move that Mars One said will make the trips ‘much safer than moon missions’. The group said it aims to have a human settlement on Mars within a decade. Journey time to Mars, which is approximately 40 million miles away depending on its position in orbit, would be around 200 days. 'I fear that it's going to be a little disillusioning for people, because it's presented as if for sure it's going to happen.' Endemol, the production company behind Big Brother, said earlier this year it will be documenting the progress of the group of hopefuls as they compete for a 2025 ticket to the red planet. Candidates do not need to have any scientific qualifications and an audience vote will be used to make the final choice. Any chosen Mars settlers will then be required to dedicate eight years of their lives preparing for the 300 million-mile (482 million km) pioneering mission. Igore Mitrofanov of the Space Research Institute at the Russian Academy of Sciences told the Voice of Russia that the largest risk is the huge amounts of radiation the volunteers will receive. Echoing Mr Hadfield's concerns, he said he doubts that the volunteers for this trip know enough science and technology to take the risk. The group had promised on its site that in 1,000 years, everyone on Earth will remember who the first humans on Mars were. A robotic lander and orbiter are scheduled to lift off in 2018, followed by a scouting rover (artist's impression pictured) in 2020 and six cargo missions in 2022 . A robotic lander and orbiter are scheduled to lift off in 2018, followed by a scouting rover in 2020 and six cargo missions in 2022. The next round will include an interview with Mars One committee members, and candidates advancing to the third round will compete against one another. The third round will include a series of challenges to prepare candidates for the potential mission and could broadcast on television and online. But Mr Hadfield claims Mars should not be a target for colonisation at this point, but targets much closer need to be considered. 'We absolutely need to do it on the moon for a few generations,' he told Mr Keep.","The Mars One mission aims to establish a colony on the red planet .

"David Simpson, 73, died from a minor fall after being wrongly prescribed a mixture of medication which prevented his blood from clotting . A dementia sufferer bled to death after a minor fall because doctors failed to notice that his medication prevented his blood from clotting, an inquest has heard. Retired gardener David Simpson, 73, was wrongly prescribed a combination of drugs which, when taken together, reduced his body's ability to clot blood. But a 'systemic failing' meant doctors at Royal Blackburn Hospital, Lancashire, 'ignored' the problem on two occasions, only taking a proper blood sample when it was 'too late'. The 73-year-old had been taken to hospital after falling from a chair while at Hollymount Nursing and Residential Home in Blackburn. At an inquest into his death, coroner Michael Singleton said Mr Simpson would not have died as a result of the fall if doctors had recognised the problem caused by the particular mixture of drugs. He said there had been opportunities for hospital staff to notice the abnormality, but that they failed to take a proper blood sample in time. He has now vowed to write to bosses at the hospital trust, warning that action should be taken. Recording a verdict of accidental death, Mr Singleton said: 'I will be sending a report to the chief executive of Royal Blackburn Hospital pointing out the problems with regards to the taking of blood samples and their analysis, and indicate to them that appropriate action should be taken to resolve what I believe to be a systemic failing.' Speaking after the inquest, Mr Simpson's 63-year-old wife Pat said she felt 'very let down' at what she had heard. She said: 'It was not just one slip up. It was the doctor with the wrong medication and it was twice with the bloods. 'Nobody is perfect and they seemed such a good crowd at the hospital, and I couldn't fault anything, but I feel very let down by what I heard at the inquest.' The court heard how Mr Simpson, who had gone to the home in April, had been prescribed warfarin following a stroke. He was later prescribed miconazole, an anti-fungal agent, for cellulitis. But the inquest heard it had been a 'personal failing' by Mr Simpson's doctor to prescribe two medicines which, when taken together, increases the anticoagulant effect. This means Mr Simpson's body's ability to blood clot was severely affected. Speaking after the inquest, Mr Simpson's 63-year-old wife Pat said she felt 'very let down' at what she had heard . After falling from the chair in August this year, Mr Simpson was taken to hospital. The inquest heard how there were no physical signs of massive abdominal bleeding. But an international normalisation ratio (INR) check would have told doctors Mr Simpson's blood was not clotting properly, the court was told. The coroner heard how doctors tried to collect blood on two consecutive days in order to take a reading. But, when they could not collect enough blood, they 'ignored it rather than go back and take another blood sample', the court heard. Mr Singleton said: 'That seems to me a systemic failure rather than an individual failure. 'There is no system in place that says if you take out a blood sample and it's insufficient then, rather than simply ignore it, you should go back and take another. Mr Simpson died at the Royal Blackburn Hospital, Lancashire (pictured) in August, after doctors failed to take sufficient blood samples on two occasions . 'One cannot speculate as to whether, in fact, had the INR been capable of being collected on the first occasion and vitamin K provided, the outcome would have been different. 'Whatever chance he had he lost by the failure to do that.' When they finally managed to test Mr Simpson's INR at the third attempt, medics discovered it had rocketed from a usual 2.6 to more than 12. Mr Simpson was given treatment but his heart stopped on Monday, August 18, three days after being taken to hospital. Mr Singleton said: 'He simply bled to death internally. 'The relatively minor fall would have itself not have caused any significant injury had it not been for the fact blood-clotting agents were such that - once there was a minor bleeding from a minor blood vessel - it simply did not stop. 'There was an opportunity to deal with that at the Royal Blackburn Hospital because on admission they took a blood sample to do the full blood count, but there was insufficient taken to collect the INR.' The retired gardener was staying at Hollymount Nursing and Residential Home, Blackburn (pictured) when he fell from a chair and was taken to hospital . He added: 'In terms of the prescribing of miconazole, that seems to me is a personal failing. There is plenty of literature out there that doctors ought to know. It seems to me that is where the problem started.' Mr Simpson's wife, Pat, who lives in Darwen, told the court that Mr Simpson had developed dementia after a stroke. He had gone into the care home after two previous short stays for respite care. In a statement, care assistant Kathleen Boardman told the court she saw Mr Simpson 'slide off a chair' onto a carpeted floor. He was given painkillers after complaining of pain in his left groin, but had no visible injuries, she added. Mrs Simpson met her husband when he moved over to Jersey in the 1970s. They were married for 38 years and had three children: Owen, 41, Rhea, 34, and Sylvia, 40. She said: 'He was a keen cyclist. He was very fit and active until his stroke. His dementia progressed quickly. It was a shock because my husband was a very intelligent man. 'It's like losing him twice because he went in the home in April and I had to learn to be without him then too. I feel guilty because I wonder if he had been at home, would he have died?' Dr Ian Stanley, acting medical director at East Lancashire Hospitals NHS Trust, said: 'We offer our condolences to Mr Simpson's family. 'The trust is currently undertaking an investigation into the circumstances around Mr Simpson's care and treatment so we are unable to comment at this time. 'Dr Roberts, the consultant who is carrying out the internal investigation, has offered to meet with Mr Simpson's family again to ensure that we keep them fully informed during this investigation and the subsequent findings.'","David Simpson, 73, fell off chair at Hollymount Nursing Home, Blackburn .

"Barry Hearn has launched an outspoken attack on the SPFL’s failure to land a multi-million pound sponsorship deal. The renowned sports impressario responsible for transforming snooker, boxing and darts was an invited speaker to an SFA convention at Hampden. He took the opportunity to brand the culture of leadership in the Scottish game ‘lazy’ and ‘disgraceful’. And he told Scottish football to stop ‘looking at its shoelaces’ and ‘wallowing in self pity’ while reserving his strongest words for the league hierachy by insisting the failure to replace Clydesdale Bank as sponsors – whose deal ended in 2012 – was a sackable offence. Matchroom Sport Chairman Barry Hearn speaks at the 2014 Scottish FA Convention . ‘I look at Scottish football and see a nation with its head down looking at its shoelaces', he said. ‘When I started off with the darts and snooker we were way down - but we believed in ourselves and had a bit of a passion. ‘Sometimes organisations get into that mode of “that’s how it is”. They are totally lazy and set in their ways. ‘The fact you’ve got a Scottish Premiership without a sponsor. Do you know how long you’d work for Barry Hearn if that was the case? ‘I won’t even tell you how long - because that’s not a performance I’m looking for. ‘You’ve got to grow. You’ve got to be positive. You can’t expect people to take you seriously if you don’t take yourself seriously. If you live in everyone’s shadow then you never come out of that shadow. ‘You need something dramatic like “attendances are going great ... commercial is this ... Abu Dhabi Bank is sponsoring the SPFL”. The fact the league doesn't have a sponsor says everything you need to know so you better get it right and if you don’t then it doesn't matter to me because I won’t be back to talk again.’ The ex-Leyton Orient chairman said it was a disgrace that the Scottish Premiership did not have a sponsor . Hearn would later comment: ‘The fact the Scottish Premier League has no sponsor is not good. Put it this way, if you worked for me you’d be sacked.’ The man who turned snooker into primetime television in the 1980s, Hearn has also been a prominent figure on the boxing circuit for decades and has now transformed darts into a sport capable of filling Glasgow’s 12,000 seat Hydro arena. Laughing off talk of sprinkling his magic on Scottish football as a consultant, Hearn added: ‘I certainly won’t be up for the leadership. But you can take a horse to water and what I’ve said isn’t rocket science. It’s just common sense. ‘If they don’t take on the wider picture then you’re stuck with what you are. ‘Listen, I’ll carry on selling 11,000 for a night of darts at the Hydro and your (football) attendances will be 1250 people or whatever. I’m a visitor so I’m cheating a bit but the world is changing and there are so many more opportunities that you might not be aware of. ‘How can a little company like mine turn over the same amount as the SPFL? And how can we make millions and millions of pounds of profit and you’re doing your b*******?’ The Scottish Cup replay between Inverness and St Mirren attracted just 1,326 fans on Tuesday .","Barry Hearn spoke at the Scottish Football Association's inaugural convention at Hampden Park .

"Anthony Joshua refused to accept a charity bet with Kevin Johnson as the two heavyweights squared off ahead of their clash in the new year. The American, who has never been stopped in his 36-fight career, offered to donate 50 per cent of his purse to a cause of Joshua’s choice if he knocked him out. But the Olympic champion was reluctant to agree to the deal during an entertaining press conference. VIDEO Scroll down for Anthony Joshua refuses charity bet with Kevin Johnson . Anthony Joshua and Kevin Johnson square up at a press conference on Wednesday . Joshua refused to accept the charity bet offered by Johnson (far right), saying he'd rather focus on the fight . The pair will touch gloves at the O2 in London on January 31 in what promises to be Joshua’s toughest test to date. Johnson took Vitali Klitschko the distance in their world title fight in 2009 and both Dereck Chisora and Tyson Fury have subsequently failed to stop him. Johnson said: 'I want to make an agreement with him. If Anthony knocks me out I'll donate 50 per cent of my purse to one of his charities. 'And if he gets knocked out, he gives 50 per cent to my charity. 'There's going to be a knockout so let's up the ante.' Joshua, however, said: 'I don't play with my money.' Johnson was unmoved and added: 'If you get me within five, I'll donate 75 per cent.' But Joshua retorted: 'He's a better comedian then he is a boxer.' Joshua cruised to victory against Michael Sprott inside two minutes last time out . Johnson and Joshua pose with promoter Eddie Hearn at the press conference in London . Johnson, 35, talked a good game on his visit to the capital on Wednesday, despite having lost his last three fights. He said: 'All I asked for is a fight with reasonable time and that's what [promoter] Eddie Hearn came up with. 'This guy gave me proper preparation time which no-one has ever given me in my whole career. 'I look forward to coming, seeing, destroying and conquering. 'In my career, I've fought four Olympians and every last one of them has made the same mistake. 'It's up to his trainers to fix it. I look forward to doing what I do best which is destroying Olympians. Johnson took Vitali Klitschko the full 12 rounds in their heavyweight world title fight in 2009 . Johnson also fought Tyson Fury who also failed to stop the veteran in a title eliminator in Belfast two years ago . Dereck Chisora found Johnson's defensive skills too difficult to penetrate and had to settle for a points win . 'This fight is everything to me; this could be the beginning or it could be the end. 'It reminds me of a young lion against an older lion. If this young lion really wants the spot, he's going to come real hard but if this lion doesn't want to give up his herd, he's going to fight even harder.' Joshua responded: 'The fight's not going to last as long as his talking! 'I've got a lot of respect for Kevin Johnson. He's not Michael Sprott, he's not Matt Skelton, he's not Denis Bakhtov. 'I'm a man with a lot of hunger and I'm willing to gain experience by fighting guys like Johnson.

"An inquiry into Ched Evans' rape conviction is underway as the former Premier League striker is keen on clearing his name after serving half of his five-year sentence. Evans was sentenced to five years in prison after he was found guilty of raping a 19-year-old woman in April 2012. The incident occurred at a Premier Inn near Rhyl, Denbighshire in May 2011. Ched Evans was pictured at a petrol garage in Wimslow, Cheshire earlier this week . Evans, pictured at his home, looks unlikely to join Oldham after talks with the League One club . Evans, now 25, has maintained his innocence despite being found guilty. The Criminal Cases Review Commission (CCRC) said in October that they would fast-track its inquiry into Evans' sentence, however it could still take 35 weeks for the independent public body to make a decision. A CCRC spokesman said: 'The case has not been prioritised because Mr Evans is relatively famous, because he plays football for a living, or for any reason external to the specific facts of the case. 'Prioritisation like this is not typical but it is by no means unprecedented. 'We prioritise applications where there is need and where it accords with our policy to do so, we expect to prioritise perhaps one or two such cases each month.' Evans has been unable to find a new club since his release from prison in October. Evans, pictured in action for Sheffield United in 2012, was jailed for the rape of a teenage girl . Ched Evans was initially allowed to train at his old club Sheffield United, before they retracted their offer . 2011 - May 30: Ched Evans arrested on suspicion of sexual assault at a Premier Inn near Rhyl, North Wales.

April 23: The Professional Footballers Association is forced to defend itself after Evans is named in the League One team of the year with chief executive Gordon Taylor stating: 'That was a football judgement by his fellow professionals, it was not a moral judgement and in no way does the PFA condone the offence for which he was convicted.' Evans is released by Sheffield United at the end of the season. April 24: Evans' lawyers announce he is to appeal against his conviction. August 21: The first stage of Evans' appeal is rejected after a judge had refuses his application for leave to appeal against his conviction.

November 11: Sheffield United confirm Evans will return to train with the club with immediate effect following a request from the Professional Footballers' Association but state they are 'not prepared at this time' to make a decision on whether to re-sign the striker.

"Brian Clough famously used to say his England goalkeeper Peter Shilton was worth 18 points a season when Nottingham Forest were winning league titles and European Cups. Well, David de Gea could beat even that – on current form he is going to earn Manchester United an extra 24 points in this campaign. In the last two months, De Gea has helped turn likely defeats against Everton and Arsenal into victories, and enabled them to draw with Chelsea and beat Stoke City. David de Gea punches the air in celebration after his saves helped earn Manchester United three more points . Juan Mata congratulates his club and international team-mate after the keeper had earned yet more points . Those extra nine points won buy United in the first 14 matches equate to 24 points over a 38-game season. And without the super Spaniard, United would be sitting in 11th place with 16 points – not in a top-four Champions League spot. This is how De Gea's influence can be broken down. October 5 – Man Utd 2 Everton 1 Points saved: Three . It is no exaggeration to say United could have lost, let alone drawn, against Everton had it not been for De Gea's heroics. His first vital intervention was to save a penalty from Leighton Baines – diving low to his right to get a strong hand to the spot-kick, the first one Baines had missed in 15 penalty attempts. Leighton Baines sees his penalty saved, the first time the Englishman had been denied from the spot . Then, with Everton pushing for a late equaliser, De Gea made a flying save to tip away a shot from Leon Osman and followed up with an incredible leap to get his fingertips to a Bryan Ovideo half-volley that was heading for the postage stamp in the very top corner. He was immediately mobbed by Marcos Rojo and other United defenders while Everton boss Roberto Martinez put his head in his hands on the touchline. Once United had taken the lead De Gea kept them in front with a stunning double save to deny Everton . October 26 – Man Utd 1 Chelsea 1 Points saved: One . Robin van Persie's injury-time equaliser gave United a massive pyschological lift for the remainder of the season, but Chelsea would already have been out of sight if not for De Gea. The Spaniard showed good judgement and reflexes to save from Didier Drogba and Eden Hazard in one-against-one situations, Hazard couldn't believe he had been denied with his clever low finish to the corner. Even more critically, once Chelsea had gone in front through Drogba, De Gea kept out a rising shot from Willian that would have given the unassailable 2-0 lead. Not only did he stop the 25-yard drive, he caught it – and was able to immediately launch a United counter-attack. November 22 – Arsenal 1 Man Utd 2 Points saved: Three . Both managers said afterwards Arsenal had been the better team at The Emirates. The home side ended up empty-handed though because of their nine shots on target, only one beat De Gea – and that was a late effort from Oliver Giroud when it was too late. De Gea does brilliantly to deny Jack Wilshere as Arsenal dominated the game but could not take the lead . The Spanish keeper saved eight of Arsenal's nine shots on target, and United snatched all three points . De Gea wasn't even a guaranteed starter after dislocating his finger on international duty with Spain, but you couldn't tell as he made a string of saves, most notably from Jack Wilshere, Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and his former United team-mate Danny Welbeck. December 2 – Man Utd 2 Stoke City 1 Points saved: Two . Praised by manager Louis van Gaal for keeping his 'concentration and focus' after two fantastic late saves to earn United a win having previously been a spectator for 89 minutes. Mame Diouf's late header would have put Stoke level, but De Gea made a sharp stop to preserve United's lead . It was clear to see how much another win, United's fourth on the bounce, meant to the young Spanish stopper . First, he somehow managed to block a bullet header from Biram Mame Diouf right on the line with a combination of arms, legs and body when the Stoke forward couldn't have been more than four yards out. And with Stoke pressing, he then stopped a fierce drive by Marko Arnautovic at point-blank range .

"Liverpool owner John Henry has responded to fans over their protest over ticket prices – but supporters have said they will continue to protest until a meeting with the club is organised. Liverpool supporters union The Spirit of Shankly and fans group Spion Kop 1906 wrote an open letter to the owner saying they will stop flying their protest flags when the club arrange a meeting to discuss the high ticket prices. Jay McKenna, Spirit of Shankly chairman, told the Liverpool ECHO: ‘John Henry has replied saying the club will be in contact. As yet we haven’t had confirmation of a meeting. Liverpool fans hold banners protesting at the cost of rising ticket prices at Anfield . ‘As far as we’re concerned until they contact us and tell us there’s a meeting we continue as we are doing. ‘This weekend and December 9 we’re still objecting and will do so until they make contact.’ Fans held a protest during Saturday’s win over Stoke where they replaced their traditional flags and banners with protest ones over the rising ticket prices. Liverpool fans make their feelings clear with a banner complaining at the ticket prices . Flags pointed out that the price of tickets increased from £4 in 1990 to £24 in 2000, then to £43 in 2010. A fourth flag had the year 2020 on with a question mark indicating fans’ fears over what prices could rise to. A huge banner was also emblazoned with the words ‘Let me tell you a story of a poor boy”, the first line of the Reds’ anthem Scouser Tommy. This season the most expensive single match adult ticket at Anfield now costs £59, while the cheapest is £37. Liverpool owner John Henry has made contact with the groups - but no meeting has been arranged yet . The open letter to Mr Henry read: ‘This isn’t merely a withdrawal of our ‘support’. It’s because we support the team and this football club so much that we persist in protesting. No, this is something much bigger. It is a warning of what is to come.’ Fans fear they will continue to be priced out of the game by the rising prices and want to discuss this with the club before it goes too far.","Liverpool fans held banners protesting the rising cost of tickets at Anfield .

"Tamir Rice, the 12-year-old boy shot dead by a Cleveland police officer who mistook his pellet gun for a real weapon last month, has been laid to rest. Two hundred mourners, many wearing white 'R.I.P. Tamir' t-shirts, paid their respects to the young boy at his funeral service at Mount Sinai Baptist Church in Cleveland on Wednesday morning. The boy's mother, Samaria Rice, hid behind sunglasses as she took her seat next to the boy's father, Leonard Warner, and their daughters, while mourners pored over photographs of Tamir. During the service, the boy's great-uncle called for people to fight for change through peaceful protest and called for the congregation to give Tamir a voice. Heartbroken: Samaria Rice, center, leaves the funeral services of her son Tamir Rice in Cleveland on Wednesday, 10 days after he was shot by a police officer who thought he was carrying a real gun . Tragic: Pallbearers carry out the 12-year-old boy's casket from Gaines Funeral Home on Wednesday . Devastated: Mourners break down in sobs as the casket leaves the funeral home on Wednesday . 'Tamir can no longer speak for himself. This is why Tamir must live through us. We must now be his voice,' Michael Petty said. 'Through us, Tamir will be heard from the grave. Through us, Tamir will prevent further senseless shootings... not only in Cleveland, but in this nation.' He added that police need to change how they train officers and take a closer look at how they communicate with dispatchers after messages were apparently not properly relayed to the officers in Tamir's case. 'We must now be his advocate for change and reform,' Petty said, NBC reported. 'Through peaceful protest, civil disobedience, and legislation, Tamir will be heard.' A teacher who taught Tamir at Marion C. Seltzer Elementary School also spoke at the services and said he was 'well liked' but 'would laugh and talk with students he didn't even know'. She said that while he loved to draw and play basketball, he was sometimes challenged by school work. She then turned to Tamir's mother. Loved: A mourner hold a program showing the  boy, who was shot dead by the officer on November 22 .

Memories: Mourners look at photographs of Tamir before his funeral begins on Wednesday morning . 'I thank you for your son's life,' she said. 'He will be greatly missed.' The youngster was remembered 10 days after 26-year-old rookie cop Timothy Loehmann fatally shot him in a city park following a 911 call saying the boy was 'waving around a gun' and pointing it at people. It has since emerged that the 911 dispatcher did not rely the caller's comments that the weapon might be fake, and the officer shot the boy less that two seconds after he arrived on the scene. Footage of the incident shows the officers pulling up beside the boy in a park and yelling at him to put his hands up, authorities say. But rather than raise his hands, the boy apparently reaches towards his waist band and Loehmann shoots the boy. He died the following day. After the shooting, it emerged that the boy was just 12 and was carrying a replica 'airsoft' gun. Airsoft guns fire non-lethal spherical plastic pellets and have orange tips to show they aren't real firearms, but police said the one the boy had didn't have the bright safety indicator, making it indistinguishable from a real firearm. Following his death, protesters demonstrated in the street and blocked up major intersections. Final moments: In footage released by the Cleveland Police Department, a police car pulls up alongside the boy. But rather than raise his hands, his reaches for his belt line, they claim. He was then shot . Sadness: After the 12-year-old's death - and in the wake of the grand jury's decision not to indict Michael Brown's killer in Ferguson - protesters took to the streets in Cleveland to call for change . Shooter: Rookie officer Tim Loehmann, pictured  left, was put on leave after the shooting. It has since emerged that he previously left another police department after his seniors said he lacked maturity . The rallies came a day after a grand jury announced they would not indict Ferguson Police Officer Darren Wilson for shooting dead Michael Brown, another black, unarmed youth. Loehmann had only joined the Cleveland police in March after spending six months in 2012 with the police department in suburban Independence. Personnel files released on Wednesday that showed police supervisors in Independence decided he lacked the maturity needed to work in their department. A letter in his file said there was a pattern of a lack of indiscretion and of not following instructions. 'In law enforcement there are times when instructions need be followed to the letter, and I am under the impression Ptl. Loehmann, under certain circumstances, will not react in the way instructed,' the letter said. Loehmann resigned from the Independence police department in December 2012 after meeting his supervisors about their concerns. A grand jury will now consider whether charges are merited.","Tamir Rice was fatally shot by officer Timothy Loehmann after 'waving around' a fake gun in a Cleveland park on November 22 .

"Two of America's top restaurants are set to adopt a new system that will force diners to pay for their meal when they book a reservation - in the hopes of curbing dinner cancelations. New York's Per Se and Napa Valley's The French Laundry, both owned by acclaimed chef Thomas Keller, will begin using Tock, a booking system created by restaurateur Nick Kokonas that's slated to launch in early 2015. Tock requires customers to reserve tables online and pay the full amount of the restaurant's prix fixe tasting menu - including service charges - in advance, so that the post-meal bill includes only drinks. Tickets are non-refundable. Scroll down for video . Pre-paid meals: New York's Per Se (pictured) and Napa Valley's The French Laundry, both owned by acclaimed chef Thomas Keller, will begin using Tock, a booking system that's slated to launch in early 2015 . Both of Mr Keller's famed restaurants offer extravagant eight-course tasting menus; the price of Per Se's is $310, while dinner at French Laundry costs $295. Mr Kokonas began using a pilot version of the software in Alinea and Next, two Chicago establishments that he co-owns with Grant Achtaz, in 2012. 'Per Se and The French Laundry will work exactly like Alinea. Pre-purchase of the tasting menu, phone call to every guest,' he told Eater. Other eateries that have tested an early version of Tock include San Francisco's Coi, Los Angeles' Trois Mec and Wylie Dufresne's recently closed New York spot WD~50. Mr Kokonas will charge restaurants a $695 monthly fee for unlimited use of the program, which will help owners ensure that last-minute cancellations don't affect their profits. Be our guest: Mr Keller said that Tock will make it easier for diners to book reservations at The French Laundry (pictured) Coi's owner, Bay Area chef Daniel Patterson, told the New York Times that Tock is perfect for his new restaurant Aster, which has only four seats and offers a tasting menu that features expensive ingredients such as spiny lobster. 'When there is a limited supply, Tock works really well,' he said. Earlier this week, Mr Keller told Inside Scoop SF that the new system will improve the experience of booking reservations at his restaurants, which previously required diners to call a month in advance. 'Right now when you call for a reservation at 10 a.m., 90per cent of the time you’ll get a busy signal,' he said of French Laundry. 'Then the majority of our guests who get through get the response of ""Sorry we’re booked."" Now they are disappointed they didn’t get a reservations. This affords certainly more transparency and more opportunity to get a reservation without the frustration of calling and getting a busy signal.'","Tock, a pre-paid booking system created by Chicago restaurateur Nick Kokonas, is set to launch in early 2015 ."

"The sun is entering an unusually heavy period of solar activity, and the poor planet Earth is bearing the brunt of it. Luckily for us earthlings, any disturbance we experienced from the latest outbursts were simply an extraordinary display of the aurora borealis, or the Northern Lights. The spectacular lights display, caused by radiation hitting the upper reaches of our atmosphere, are not being true to their name after being seen as far south as Iowa, Nebraska and Maryland in the United States which, relative to Europe, are about as far South as southern Spain and the Mediterranean. Solar flares: A European visitor to the Badlands, South Dakota, took these pictures of the aurora, much further south than they should be . Aurora were seen as far south as Ocean City, Maryland. This photo was taken by a camper on the shores of Assateague Island, facing north . The speckled face of the sun: These sunspots, particularly 1504, have peaked over the last few days . In the early hours of Saturday morning, the combined effects of two coronal . mass ejections from a sunspot which Nasa named AR 1504, passed NASA's Advanced Composition Explorer . (ACE) spacecraft on the way toward Earth's protective magnetic bubble, . the magnetosphere. ACE is approximately 900,000 miles from Earth and can . detect such incoming shocks about 30-45 minutes before they hit the . magnetosphere - a handy early-warning system. Simulations performed at NASA Goddard's Space . Weather Center indicate that the disturbance strongly compressed the . magnetopause, ultimately to a minimum of approximately 24,000 miles from . Earth's surface at 6:28 PM EDT. This is an altitude some 2,000 miles . lower than spacecraft in geosynchronous orbit. The Solar Dynamics Observatory captured this image of an M1.2 class flare on June 13, 2012. The sun is shown here in teal as this is the color typically used to represent light in the 131 Angstrom wavelength, a wavelength particularly good for observing flares . The changing shape . of Earth's magnetopause also influenced the aurora, causing bright . aurora to be seen at lower latitudes than normal. An active region on the sun, numbered AR 1504, rotated into view over the left side of the sun on June 10, 2012. The region fired off flares and two coronal mass ejections on June 13 and June 14, 2012. The first flare lasted for a relatively long three hours, peaking on June 13, 2012. The associated CME traveled at approximately 375 miles per second and is directed toward Earth. The second M-class flare was also a long-duration flare, and it peaked on June 14, 2012.

"Three times as many children have tried e-cigarettes as have smoked tobacco, figures show. They have prompted concern that e-cigs are acting as a ‘nicotine gateway’ for children luring them to back to more harmful cigarettes. A study of 1,601 pupils aged 10 and 11 in Wales found that six per cent had tried e-cigs compared to just two per cent who had smoked tobacco. Furthermore, those who had tried the devices were seven times more likely to admit they might take up smoking within the next two years. A study of 1,601 pupils aged 10 and 11 in Wales found that six per cent had tried e-cigarettes, compared with just two per cent who had smoked tobacco (file image) Some 14 per cent of those who’d tried e-cigs said they might start compared to just two per cent of children who’d never tried. The battery-operated devices resemble pens or cigarettes and they contain a liquid form of nicotine that give users the same rush as smoking. They are used by an estimated one million Britons trying to give up smoking but concerns have also been raised that they are luring children on to tobacco. The study was only carried out on Welsh pupils and Public Health England said its own similar survey had found just two per cent of children had tried them. Nonetheless campaigners said the findings showed the need to keep a ‘watchful eye’ on their use. Mark Drakeford, health minister for Wales said: ‘These latest findings shine further light on the potential impact of e-cigarettes on our children and young people. ‘I am concerned the use of e-cigarettes may act as a gateway to and re-normalise smoking, especially for a generation who have grown up in a largely smoke-free society.' Dr Penny Woods, chief executive of the British Lung Foundation said: ‘This research is interesting in that it is the first survey of its kind in the UK to find the number of children who have tried e-cigarettes to be higher than the number who have tried smoking. Experts have raised concerns that the devices are acting as 'nicotine gateways' luring children to smoke . ‘This again emphasises that e-cigarettes are still an emerging and evolving technology, and that we need to keep a watchful eye on how they are being used, particularly by children. Although there is no evidence that vaping (smoking an e-cig) is anywhere near as harmful as smoking, e-cigarettes are not recommended for children or non-smokers, at least until more research has been conducted into their long-term health impacts. ‘That said, these data on their own don’t provide clear evidence of the so-called ‘gateway effect’ of e-cigarette use leading to sustained smoking. ‘Research suggests that smoking rates amongst UK children overall, while still too high, have continued to decline since the emergence of e-cigarettes last decade.’","Study of 1,601 pupils aged 10 and 11 in Wales found 6% had tried e-cigs .

"Designer Donna Karan has revealed how she managed to avoid falling prey to the stressful 'chaos' of living and working in New York City, while creating three globally-successful fashion labels. In an interview with The New Potato, the 66-year-old admits that, while New York has helped to inspire and influence her clothing designs, the madness of city living can sometimes prove too much. Speaking about her newly-launched clothing and accessories line Urban Zen, which is targeted at an older audience than her popular DKNY designs, Donna explains how she has slowed the pace of her own often-manic lifestyle and carved out her own peaceful sanctuary in the heart of New York. Scroll down for video . Staying active: Designer Donna Karan has been doing yoga since the age of 18 and says she feels totally comfortable with . 'New York has been my inspiration,' she says. 'Because of the craziness of New York, I started Urban Zen to find the calm in the chaos of the city we live in and love. Being down here, in this loft at Urban Zen, is sort of an escape.' The new line entirely different from her DKNY and Donna Karan collections, both of which have proved to be incredibly popular the world over. But Urban Zen marks a move away from more mainstream fashion, in favor of comfortable, yet chic, styles which are as suitable for a yoga class as they would be for a dinner date, and are a clear reflection of Donna's low-key lifestyle. 'Anything that I don’t have to get dressed for, or put on make-up, I love,' she jokes. When it comes to achieving the perfect lifestyle balance, Donna has learned to embrace those activities that she enjoys the most - specifically yoga and food. Building an urban sanctuary: The 66-year-old's newest label Urban Zen is targeted at a more 'yoga-minded' woman . 'I get up every morning and have my protein drink from We Care,' she says. 'In the afternoon I have to have soup and salad, usually a green soup. I also like green juices. I love Italian food, especially Tutto il Giorno and Bar Pitti... 'I started doing yoga when I was eighteen years old, so I started at a very young age. It was something that I felt comfortable with. I love being on a mat; I love having a teacher; I love going inside, because I’m constantly outside.' But while Donna has learned to find the perfect balance when it comes to city living, she suggests the ability can only come with years of experience, something which she feels is reflected in the attitudes and lifestyles of the different age groups each of her lines is targeted at. Describing 'the Donna Karan woman' as someone who is constantly on the move, while working at an executive level position, Donna stresses that DKNY's customers tend to be more young, urban people who are 'constantly looking for jobs'. Park life: Speaking about her home, which is next to one of New York's green spaces, Donna confesses that if she isn't near nature, she 'gets really nasty' When it comes to Urban Zen, the label's most devoted fans tend to be 'a little bit more yoga-minded' and bohemian, with a strong focus on body and movement. Speaking about her own lifestyle, Donna makes clear that she is leaning more towards the Urban Zen way of living, describing yoga, something which she has been doing since the age of 18, as one of her central focuses. Donna also stresses her love of nature and confesses that being close to an open, green space - in her case, a city park - helps her to find focus. 'I live on the park, so in that sense, I make sure that I have nature around me,' she says.

"Leicester City have opened an investigation into the altercation between manager Nigel Pearson and some of his own club's fans in Tuesday night's defeat by Liverpool. Leicester remained bottom of the table after a 3-1 defeat to the Merseyside club at the King Power Stadium. Pearson opts to sit amongst the fans instead of occupying the touchline, but with the club struggling in the league it left him exposed to criticism and in a heated exchange he hit back. Leicester manager Nigel Pearson positions himself in the stands, where he is surrounded by supporters . Leicester lost 3-1 against Liverpool on Tuesday night in the Premier League as they remain bottom . A Leicester City spokesman said: 'We are aware of an incident that took place during Tuesday night's match and are looking into the matter to establish a full and accurate account of proceedings. 'Once the facts have been determined and suitably corroborated, we will decide what next steps, if any, should be taken.' After the 3-1 loss on Tuesday, Pearson hit out at the 'irritating' pundits on Sky Sports along with some of Leicester's supporters. The Foxes' boss saw his side surrender a lead against the Reds, a result which leaves them rooted to the foot of the Premier League table. And Pearson was clearly irked in the immediate aftermath when addressing the problems at his door. Pearson: 'I replied to one idiot in the stands and if he doesn't like what he sees, then don't bother coming' He admitted to telling one fan not to bother returning to the King Power Stadium if they aren't prepared to show support. Pearson  positions himself in the stands, where he is surrounded by supporters, instead of on the touchline because the 51-year-old feels it gives him a better tactical point of view. But the manager was subject to criticism on Tuesday. 'I replied to one idiot in the stands and if he doesn't like what he sees, then don't bother coming,' Pearson told SkySports. 'Maybe they ought to think about staying at home, we need support their support. We've worked hard tonight and will continue to do so.' Leicester took the lead after Leonardo Ulloa shot rebounded off the post and in off Simon Mignolet's back . The advantage didn't last, though, as Adam Lallana hit back with this left-footed strike . Steven Gerrard put Liverpool in front with their second and celebrated in emphatic fashion . Jordan Henderson was on the spot to score after Raheem Sterling's clever back heel to wrap things up . And he then turned on the broadcaster in his press conference, saying: 'I find some of the - I don't know what you call them - presenters are particularly irritating.' It was Leicester's second defeat in four days after last year's Championship winners  were beaten 3-2 by Queens Park Rangers at Loftus Road on Saturday. Pearson's men visit Aston Villa in the Premier League on Sunday, who recorded their first win since September 13 with a 1-0 victory over Crystal Palace at Selhurst Park on Tuesday.","Nigel Pearson said he  told fans to stay away if they only come to criticise .

"Civil rights activist Amelia Boynton Robinson, pictured in 2011. In a new interview she says she fears skin color will matter for another 100 years . A 103-year-old activist who featured in an iconic 1965 picture has recalled the moment she was beaten unconscious during a civil rights march saying she fears skin color will matter for another 100 years. Amelia Boynton Robinson, was beaten by police during a march in Alabama almost 50 years ago, which became known as Bloody Sunday. The image of her lying on the ground being helped by a passer-by shocked America and the world and the story is part of a brand new film about the civil rights movement called Selma. Racial tensions have been brought to the fore once again across the U.S. after unarmed black teenager Michael Brown was shot dead by police officer Darren Wilson in Ferguson, Missouri in August. The shooting sparked protests across the state last month when a grand jury decided not to indict the police officer. And in an interview with the New York Post, Mrs Boynton Robinson, spoke of how she had been disturbed by the recent events in Ferguson. She told the newspaper: 'I still see a lot of discrimination. I don't think it will be until another 100 years that people will be truly colorblind.' Mrs Boynton Robinson first came to worldwide attention in 1965 when she helped organise civil and voting rights marches from the town of Selma to Alabama's state capital of Montgomery. The marches came after it was revealed 50 per cent of the population of Selma was black, but only one per cent were registered to vote. But the first march descended into chaos when the 600-strong group crossed the Edmund Pettus Bridge and state police began to beat them. Mrs Boynton Robinson was beaten unconscious before having tear gas sprayed into her eyes and mouth. Mrs Boynton Robinson first came to worldwide attention in 1965 when images of her being helped by a stranger after being beaten unconscious by state police shocked America . The story of the three Selma to Montgomery marches in 1965 will form part of the story of a new film called Selma about Martin Luther King, which is released on Christmas Day . She recalled: 'They came from the right. They came from the left. One of the troopers shouted ""Run!"" I thought ""Why should I be running?"" 'Then an officer on horseback hit me across the back of the shoulders and, for a second time, on the back of the neck. I lost consciousness.' Fortunately, a young man saw her and dragged her to the safety of an ambulance, with the image of her being helped becoming a well-known picture in the civil rights struggle. And despite her injuries, she took part in a further two marches, just months before the Voting Rights Act was signed into law by President Lyndon B. Johnson. Racial tensions have come to fore once again in the U.S. recently after unarmed black teenager Michael Brown, pictured, was shot dead by police officer Darren Wilson in Ferguson, Missouri in August . People took to the streets of Ferguson to protest after a grand jury chose not to press charges against the officer who shot the teenager dead . Mrs Boynton Robinson said in the interview that she had been disturbed by the recent events in Ferguson following Michael Brown's shooting . The new film Selma focuses on Martin Luther King and the three marches which Mrs Boynton Robinson took part in. Orange Is The New Black actress Lorraine Toussaint, will play Mrs Boyton Robinson in the movie, which also stars Oprah Winfrey, Cuba Gooding Junior and Tom Wilkinson and is out on Christmas Day. Meanwhile, Michael Brown's stepfather has said sorry for his controversial and incendiary chants aimed towards the unarmed teen's supporters the night of the grand jury decision not to indict Officer Wilson. The stepfather of Michael Brown, Louis Head, pictured with Brown's mother Lesley McSpadden. He has apologised for controversial comments following the decision not to indict police officer Darren Wilson . The apology comes one day after Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson said that his department was actively pursuing an investigation into whether Louis Head incited the riots that left parts of the city a burning wreck. Head, who is married to Brown's mother, apologized to those 'who read my pain and anger as a true desire for what I want for our community. It wasn't.' He said that he feels he is being unfairly blamed for the chaos that followed his outburst, which was videoed by the New York Times on November 24, moments after the grand jury decision came in.","Amelia Boynton Robinson was beaten unconscious during a march in 1965 .

The 26-year-old centre back briefly took over the captain's armband during a Germany friendly against Argentina in 2012, but says he would be honoured to get the job full-time. 'I had it briefly on my arm during an international, but it would be something completely different to be allowed to lead the team onto the pitch,' he told German magazine Sport Bild. Berlin-born Boateng cemented his place in Germany's starting line-up during the victorious Brazil 2014 World Cup campaign and says he has proven himself as captaincy material to head coach Joachim Low. Philipp Lahm retired from international football in the summer and Bastian Schweinsteiger took the armband . The former Manchester City defender has achieved considerable success with both his club and country . 'The coach sees that I'm not someone who shouts his head off on the pitch, but takes leadership with his performances,' said Boateng. 'Besides, it shouldn't actually matter what colour a person's skin is, I see myself as German and like to show that.' Goalkeeper Manuel Neuer, who captained Germany recently in Schweinsteiger's absence, and defensive midfielder Sami Khedira are other candidates to skipper the side. Germany have struggled for form since winning their fourth World Cup and are third in their Euro 2016 qualifying group after a shock defeat to Poland and draw with Ireland.","Philipp Lahm retired from international football in the summer .

"Chinese villagers are suffering unsightly, painful and swellings all over their bodies as a result of heavy metal poisoning from  soil and water. Villagers in Sahecun village, in southern China, are suffering severe health problems – including aching bones - due to pollution caused by a lead mine that closed more than a decade ago. Government tests confirmed soaring rates of poisonous metals in the soil and water nine years ago. But a clean-up operation ordered at the time stopped shortly after, so the area has remained contaminated for years. Villagers from Sahecun, in southern China, are suffering from hideous swellings caused by heavy metal pollution from a mine that closed a decade ago. Huang Guiqiang, 58, said: 'The lumps over my body are incredibly painful, and interspersed occasionally with periods where I can't feel anything at all in my body' Guiqiang's second oldest brother Huang Fuqiang, 61, also developed the swellings, which left him confined to his bed. The pair's older brother died last year, having been bedridden for 10 years . One of the villagers, Huang Guiqiang, 58, can no longer work due to the swellings. He said: 'I noticed symptoms at the turn of the century, when I was feeling weak and listless and was no longer able to work. 'The lumps over my body are incredibly painful, and interspersed occasionally with periods where I can't feel anything at all in my body.' He said he had been helped with the cost of visiting hospital in the nearby city, where he was diagnosed as suffering from severe cadmium poisoning. Cadmium is toxic metal, which has a destructive impact on most of the body's systems if high levels are ingested. Since his diagnosis, Huang Guiqiang said little has been done to help treat the condition. The villagers still breed fish in ponds, knowing that the fish will grow up contaminated. Huang Guiqiang said: 'What choice do we have. If we don't breed fish, we won't have anything else to eat.' Guangxi Environment and Geology Research Center found the cadmium content in water in the area was 17.4 times higher than the national standard, CRI English reports. And the metal content in the region's soil was even higher – at 29.1 times higher than the national standard, the investigation, which was carried out in 2000, found. Guiqiang's second oldest brother Huang Fuqiang, 61, also began experiencing similar symptoms around the same time, growing a large number of unexplained lumps on his hands and feet, which left him confined to his bed. The pair's oldest brother, Huang Jinqiang, who was also a sufferer, died last year, having been bedridden by the disease for 10 years. Others in the village have been diagnosed with ostealgia - a medical condition that results in acute pain in the bones, CRI English reports. In the 1950s, villagers were given well-paid jobs when Government officials authorised the mining of zinc and lead in the region. The area is severely contaminated as a result of the mining work that went on there. State sanctioned tests carried out in 2005 confirmed high levels of metals in the soil and water, but a clean up operation has stalled . The mine brought money to the area, allowing the villagers to build themselves good homes, roads and schools that would never have been possible before. For 40 years, locals benefited from the money flowing in to the local economy from the mine, but by the 1990s the mine was exhausted, and was closed down, and the money and the jobs dried up. Villagers who then tried to return to farming found that their rice fields had been contaminated from the water that leaked from the mine into the irrigation network over their arable land. Crops struggled to grow, and the food made people sick. In the end, the only way they could afford to eat was to turn the rice fields into shallow pools where they bred fish. But these too were infected and have been making locals ill. Environmental experts sent to the village, which is in Daxin County in southern China's Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, have confirmed the area is severely contaminated as a result of the mining work that went on there. And despite stripping away contaminated soil and replacing it, the pollution always seeps back to the surface or washes over the new soil every time it rains. AFter the mine closed more than a decade ago, the only way the villagers could eat was to turn the rice fileds into shallow pools where they bred fish. Some villagers still breed fish, knowing they will become ill. The contaminated rice fields are pictured here . Huang Fugiang was diagnosed with severe cadmium poisoning which is causing his illness. Many young people have left the village, but older people with fewer job opportunities have nowhere to go . For those left behind with no opportunity to relocate, their bodies are slowly mutating and bending out of shape as a result of disease caused by the pollution. Most say they do not know exactly what is wrong with them, but suffer horrific lumps and contusions which leave them in pain. In 2005, the state sanctioned tests on the conditions of soil and water in the region, confirming the widespread contamination caused by the former zinc and lead mining industry. Although a clean-up was ordered it lasted only a few months before grinding to a halt. Since then the villagers say they have heard nothing. Now the village is home to only the elderly after much of the younger generation left to look for better and healthier lives in the bigger cities.","Villagers in Sahecun suffer abnormal swellings all over their bodies .

"When your star player kung-fu kicks a fan, you expect that to be the end of their time at your club - yet when Eric Cantona assaulted a supporter it actually extended his stay at Old Trafford! The former Manchester United forward was set to join Inter Milan in 1995 but his indiscretion and subsequent ban ensured the Italian side pulled out of the deal. In an interview with Italian paper Corriere della Sera, ex-Inter president Massimo Moratti revealed that he had teed up a double swoop for Cantona and then-Sampdoria forward Roberto Mancini towards the backend of 1994. Ex-Manchester United forward Eric Cantona kung-fu kicks a Crystal Palace fan at Selhurst Park, January 1995 . Cantona (left) was close to joining Inter Milan before the kick, according to the Italian club's former president Massimo Moratti. Inter were also pursuing a deal for then Sampdoria striker Roberto Mancini too . Cantona argues with Palace fans before jumping into the crowd and kung-fu kicking one supporter . However, Cantona's kung-fu kick and barrage of punches towards a Crystal Palace supporter at Selhurst Park after he was sent off ensured the deal could not go ahead. The ex-France international was fined £20,000 and banned for four months by United, but the FA then increased the suspension to eight months and he was forced to pay another £10,000 as well. He was also originally sentenced to a 14-day prison sentence after being convicted of assault but that was quashed on appeal.

The length of the ban ensured Inter could not pursue the deal for Cantona - and Sampdoria changed their mind about selling Mancini, meaning neither player moved to the San Siro. In Corriere, Moratti is quoted as saying: 'Then Cantona did it. 'In London, with me present, this kung-fu kick of the Crystal Palace fan. 'And then he wanted to stay in Manchester, while Sampdoria then decided that they would not let Mancini leave.' Cantona subsequently remained at United until he retired in 1997.

"Manchester City are on course to comply with UEFA’s financial fair play rules after cutting their annual losses thanks largely to a big boost in domestic television money and cutting their wage bill. The club remains loss-making, for now, posting an annual deficit of £23million for the 2013-14 season in figures just published. That is half the sum they lost the previous season. But big increases in TV money as well as another leap in commercial revenues, bolstered by keys sponsors including Etihad, mean City are highly unlikely to be adjudged to have fallen foul of UEFA’s FFP rules again. Manchester City have reported record revenues of £346.5million for the year ending May 31, 2014 . Last year they were deemed to have broken the FFP rules as a result of including almost £47m of income in their accounts from sales of intellectual property, £22.45m of it to related parties. In laymen’s terms, UEFA took a dim view of City conjuring up income that could not be justified in order to attempt to balance their books. The accounts for 2013-14 notably include zero income from sale of any intellectual property after City vowed as part of their settlement with Uefa not to repeat what they did last year. Instead City recorded notable rises in all the traditional revenue streams of a football club, with match day income rising from £39.6m to £47.5m, UEFA TV revenue rising to £31.3m from £24m, domestic TV income soaring to £101.9m from £64.3m on the back of the Premier League’s new £5.5bn TV deals, and commercial income jumping to £165.8m from £143m. City do not disclose the breakdown of where their commercial income comes from, and while large sums are believed to come from the Middle East, where the club’s owner Sheikh Mansour is based, City are also attempting to diversify their revenue streams via a network of global partners. The Etihad club now expect to comply with UEFA's Financial Fair Play rules . As the club’s total income rose by 28 per cent to £346.5 million, the club’s biggest single outlay, on wages, fell from £233m in 2012-13 to £205m last season, which equates to ‘only’ £561,764 per day. Among the clubs who have declared their financial results for 2013-14 so far, City’s wage bill now falls from being the biggest in the Premier League to second biggest behind city rivals Manchester United, who had a comparative figure of £214.8m last season. It is not clear, however, whether all the staff who were counted in last year’s figures are also counted in this year’s figures or whether some of them have been hived off into a different company for accounting purposes. Last year’s accounts showed City had 222 ‘football staff’ including players and the latest account shows this has dropped to 112 staff. Overall City’s staff numbers have inexplicably fallen from 449 people a year ago to 314 in the latest accounts. City have halved their losses from their 2013-14 Premier League winning season . The most obvious explanation at a time of expansion for City and the opening of an impressive new campus would be that some staff are now paid via a different subsidiary company of Sheikh Mansour’s global football franchise business - of which City is just one arm. City have confirmed to Sportsmail that the ‘missing’ staff are now paid via subsidiary companies and City are billed for their services. The accounts suggest this accounting manoeuvre - entirely legal - reduced City’s wage bill by around £10.8m year on year. The other reason the wage bill may have fallen is that last year’s £233m included pay-offs to former manager Roberto Mancini and some coaching staff. City’s losses take into account a £16m fine from UEFA for breaking FFP rules in their last accounting period and the latest numbers should mean that the full £50m initially imposed will not now be imposed; two-thirds of it was conditional. Manuel Pellegrini's side are second in the Premier League, six points behind leaders Chelsea . City believe they are in good financial shape to break even or even become profitable from the current season onwards. City’s chairman Khaldoon Al Mubarak says: ‘We have moved beyond the period of heavy investment that was required to make the club competitive again, it is commercial growth of the kind we are seeing today that will underpin and support our operations in the future.’ The accounts show City spent a net sum of £38.8m on summer transfers including Eliaqium Mangala, even accounting for the sales of Javier Garcia and Jack Rodwell. Mangala’s transfer fee has repeatedly been reported as £32m but in fact was closer to £40m to three third-party owners combined.","Manchester City revenue up 28 per cent thanks to 2014 Premier League win .

"Erica Ginnetti, 34, pleaded guilty on Tuesday in a Pennsylvania court to institutional sexual assault and disseminating sexually explicit materials to a minor . A high school math teacher from Pennsylvania has admitted having sex with a 17-year-old student and sending him inappropriate text messages and videos. Erica Ginnetti, a married mom-of-three from Philadelphia, pleaded guilty on Tuesday in Montgomery County court to institutional sexual assault and disseminating sexually explicit materials to a minor. The 34-year-old remains free on bail and faces a possible maximum of seven to 14 years in prison when she is sentenced. She was fired by Lower Moreland Township School District after her arrest in January. According to investigators, the math and calculus teacher first approached the victim in May 2013 when she chaperoned the senior prom and invited him to come work out at her gym. A few days later the 17-year-old responded to Ginnetti with a text message, and the two began communicating on a daily basis. The criminal complaint against Ginnetti says that over the next several months, she sent the minor sexually explicit text messages, photos depicting her wearing bikini, a thong and other underwear, and videos showing the woman undressing suggestively and performing a sexual act on herself, according to The Bucks County Courier Times. Ginnetti, pictured above with her husband, first approached her victim in May 2013 when she chaperoned the senior prom and invited him to come work out at her gym . According to officials, the illicit relationship culminated in July 2013 when Ginnetti and the student met for coffee in Starbucks and then drove to an industrial park to have sex in her car. She then allegedly dropped her paramour back at the coffee shop and told him not to tell anyone about the encounter. Authorities say the investigation began after they received a tip-off that students had been overheard discussing X-rated pictures showing a minor and Ginnetti doing 'sexual things.' When police questioned the 17-year-old boy, he came clean about the affair and Ginnetti then also confessed to having a relationship with the student, police said. Watch the full report on CBS Philly here. The 34-year-old, pictured above after her arrest in January, remains free on bail and faces a possible maximum of seven to 14 years in prison when she is sentenced . Two months after Ginnetti first met her 17-year-old victim at his prom in May 2013 they drove to an industrial park and had sex in her car . ‘I would say that she treated her relationship with this student as she would have treated a relationship with an adult with whom she was involved,’ Montgomery County District Attorney Risa Vetri Ferman told The Mercury News in January. Police said they found several texts the lovers had exchanged discussing their July outing and one mentioning ‘a used condom that had been left in Ginnetti’s vehicle,’ according to the criminal complaint. On the night of the alleged tryst, after he returned home, the student told police he got a text from Ginnetti asking him to ‘do it again.’ As part of her $50,000 bail condition in January, Ginnetti was forbidden from having unsupervised contact with any minors except for her own children, ages 8, 11 and 14. She also had to surrender her passport, and the authorities have been keeping track of her using a GPS device.

"Cosby’s tweets came just hours after he was sued by a 55-year-old woman, who claims the comedian molested her at the Playboy Mansion back when she was 15 years old . Bill Cosby has broken his silence over the numerous rape allegations that have resurfaced in recent weeks to publicly thank two celebrities who have made attempts to defend him in public. Whoopi Goldberg, in her role as moderator on ABC’s The View, and singer Jill Scott have both received a great deal of flak for publicly questioning if the sexual assault allegations against Cosby are true. The 77-year-old comedian first tweeted 'Thank you' to Goldberg on Tuesday night and then on Wednesday morning he sent the same message to Scott and added 'from the Cosby family'. When the allegations against Cosby first re-emerged last month, Goldberg expressed skepticism in particular about allegations made by Barbara Bowman that Cosby had drugged and sexually assaulted her in 1985. Goldberg asked why Ms Bowman didn't go to the authorities for proof that she was raped. 'Perhaps the police might have believed it. Or the hospital. Don't you do a kit when you say someone has raped you?' she said on The View. Goldberg then went on to say that she didn't buy Bowman's story. 'Quite honestly, look, I'm sorry, having been on both sides of this where people allege that you do something - it doesn't matter now. The cat is out of the bag, people have it in their head. I have a lot of questions for the lady, maybe she'll come on.' Goldberg also appeared to sympathize with Cosby, saying it was 'awkward' when celebrities were falsely accused of crimes. The View host Whoopi Goldberg and singer Jill Scott, right, have both come in for flak after publicly showing their support for Bill Cosby after a series of rape allegations made against him resurfaced in recent weeks . 'I hope that there is justice for this lady. I hope somebody gets to the bottom of this, but I’m going to reserve my judgment because I have a lot of questions, as I said. It’s crazy, but I have a lot of questions, because I know we all have friends who have gone through this.' Singer Scott has come in for criticism from her fans over the past week after repeatedly tweeting her support for Cosby. The Philadelphia-born singer received an honorary doctorate from Temple University in May and was photographed receiving it from Cosby. The comedian resigned from the university’s board of trustees on Tuesday. Last week one of Scott’s followers tweeted her a link to a petition asking Temple to end its relationship with Cosby. Instead of supporting the cause, Scott tweeted her support. ‘So they've proven the alleged allegations? I didn't know. Will they also be giving him back the millions he's donated?’ she tweeted. The singer soon started receiving a number of tweets from followers expressing their disappointment and even anger with her stance. The Philadelphia-born singer received an honorary doctorate from Temple University in May and was photographed receiving it from Cosby . Last week one of Scott’s followers tweeted her a link to a petition asking Temple to end its relationship with Cosby - but she instead tweeted her support for the comedian . 'For a world traveled, educated, woman AND mother to take up for a man who has abused women in his past is disheartening,' hit back one person . Scott then posted another tweet saying, 'I’m respecting a man who has done more for the image of Brown people that almost anyone EVER. From Fat Albert to the Huxtables.' The singer continued to defend Cosby as recently as yesterday whens he accused the media and society of 'attempting to destroy his magnificent legacy'. Cosby’s tweets came just hours after he was sued by a 55-year-old woman, who claims the comedian molested her at the Playboy Mansion back when she was 15 years old. Judy Huth's lawsuit filed on Tuesday in Los Angeles accuses Cosby of forcing her to perform a sex act on him in a bedroom of the Playboy Mansion around 1974. Scott has repeatedly stood by her support for Cosby in discussions on Twitter with followers who have taken her to task . On Monday Scott accused the media and society of attempting to destroy Cosby's 'magnificent legacy' She is the latest woman to accuse the comedian of sex abuse, and is the first one since 2005 to file a lawsuit. Cosby has been beset for weeks by allegations by more than a dozen women that he drugged and sexually assaulted them in incidents spanning several decades. The comedian has not been criminally charged and many of the claims are so old, they are barred by statutes of limitations. Huth's lawsuit, however, contends that she became aware of the serious effect the abuse had on her within the past three years. California law allows victims of sex abuse when they were minors to bring a claim after adulthood if they discover later in life that they suffered psychological injuries as a result of the abuse. Cosby has not been criminally charged, but Netflix and NBC have scuttled projects featuring the comedian and several shows on his comedy tour have also been canceled. Tears: Janice Dickinson, 59, broke down during the CNN interview on Monday, where she said Cosby had given her a pill which made her black out, and that she woke up after he raped her . Huth's sexual battery and infliction of emotional distress lawsuit states that she and a 16-year-old friend first met Cosby at a Los Angeles-area film shoot and the comedian gave the girls drinks a week later at a tennis club. The lawsuit states that Cosby took them to the Playboy Mansion after several drinks, and told the teenagers to lie and say they were 19 years old if asked. Her lawsuit states Cosby forced her to perform a sex act on him with her hand. 'This traumatic incident, at such a tender age, has caused psychological damage and mental anguish for (Huth) that has caused significant problems throughout her life,' the lawsuit states. Huth's lawsuit filed in Los Angeles Superior Court is the first time a woman has gone public claiming Cosby abused her when she was underage. A second woman told Pittsburgh television station KDKA last month that Cosby drugged her to the point of unconsciousness in the 1980s when she was 15. The suit does not specify how much Huth is seeking from Cosby. Cosby's attorney Martin Singer has denied previous accusations or said the women raising the claims in interviews had been discredited.

"Scientists have discovered that it’s possible to hear the sound of coral reefs perishing. At their brightest and most vibrant, coral reefs are among the noisiest environments on the planet and a healthy reef can be heard by sea creatures - and by humans using underwater microphones - from several miles away. Now experts have recorded the more muted sound of a dying reef, as resident fish and crabs fight for their survival. Scroll down for sound clips . Scientists have recorded the more muted sound of a dying reef, as resident fish and crabs fight for their survival. A stock image of a reef suffering from acidification of the ocean is shown . Researchers from two British universities believe that human activities such as over-fishing drive away marine life so reefs are quieter. This has a huge impact on the fish and invertebrates that rely on the underwater habitat for their home and food. Dr Julius Piercy, from the University of Essex, led the study, which involved taking acoustic recordings of coral reefs with different levels of protection around islands in the Philippines. The research found that the noise produced by the few remaining resident fish and crustaceans on unprotected reefs was only one third of that made from bustling, healthy reef communities. Scientists have discovered that it’s possible to hear the sound of coral reefs dying. A clip of the sounds produced by residents of an ailing reef in the Philippines can be heard (above) Bright and beautiful: At their brightest and most vibrant, coral reefs (stock picture) are among the noisiest environments on the planet and a healthy reef can be heard by sea creatures – and using underwater microphones – from several miles away . Across the world, 50 per cent of coral reefs have been destroyed in the last 30 years and the fight is on to save them. Each year between one per cent and two per cent of world coral reefs are destroyed, largely by shoreline pollution and climate change. Scientists think that rising air and ocean surface temperatures are causing coral bleaching and changing the chemistry of the oceans. Warmer water stresses corals, which are incredibly sensitive to temperature. If temperatures rise, the zooxanthellae consumed by coral as food leaves their tissue and they turn white, because the algae gives it its colour and nutrients. White coral is said to be bleached and is weak. As carbon dioxide levels rise, more of the gas dissolves into the ocean, causing it to become more acidic - a process called acidification. The decreasing pH means that corals can't absorb the calcium carbonate they need to maintain their skeletons and the reefs dissolve. Last year, the Catlin Seaview Survey (CSS) teamed up with scientists around the world to create a record of the state of the world's vanishing marine habitats. The level of noise is considered vital to the larval stages of reef fish and invertebrates, which spend the first few days of their life away from reefs and use sound as an orientation cue to find their way back. With less sound being produced at impacted reefs, the distance over which larvae can detect habitat is ten times less. This means that future generations could be affected, which are needed to build up and maintain healthy population levels. Dr Piercy said: ‘In an environment where underwater noise plays such an important role in the population dynamics of coral reefs, it is alarming to find such a large effect of human impact on the natural acoustic environment. ‘This puts reef sound in the spotlight for the people who manage coral reef ecosystems because they might need to consider reef sound as an integral part of the design of marine protected area networks to ensure that there is sufficient recruitment of larvae and this study also shows sound can be useful in monitoring the health of coral reefs.’ ‘With growing evidence demonstrating the direct impacts of man-made noise on aquatic life, these findings highlight additional indirect human impacts, such as over-fishing and landscape development, on natural underwater sounds. Dr Steve Simpson, of the University of Exeter, added: ‘Taking sound recordings is a cheap, fast and objective way to get a broad idea of whether a reef is in a good condition or not. Researchers from two universities believe that human activities such as over-fishing drive away marine life so reefs are quieter. The sound of a healthy reef can be heard above . ‘It can’t replace detailed visual surveys conducted by snorkelers or divers but it gives a good account of the cryptic and nocturnal species missed in visual census and gives us a general picture of the state of coral reefs without the need for time-consuming surveys and extensive training. ‘We still know very little about what sounds these animals are listening to and it is likely to be very different between species. ‘Combined with recent findings that fish dislike the smell of impacted reefs there is a real need to understand how human impacts can indirectly affect the success of future generations of reef organisms.’","Researchers from the universities of Essex and Exeter recorded noise levels in healthy and declining reefs in the Philippines .
They found that noise levels dropped by two thirds as creatures died .
Healthy coral reefs are among the noisiest environments on the planet .

"David Moyes was in Spain on Friday night to hold talks with Real Sociedad about becoming the La Liga club’s next manager. The former United boss was given a tour of the Basque side but is yet to decide whether to re-establish his career there. Moyes, 51, has been out of work since April when his dream job to follow Sir Alex Ferguson at Manchester United was cut short after just 10 difficult months. Former Manchester United manager David Moyes was given a tour of Real Sociedad on Friday night . Moyes' reign at Old Trafford lasted just 10 months as the Scotsman failed to get the best out of his players . Now the man who was three times voted manager of the year by the LMA during more than a decade in charge at Goodison Park has to decide if he has found the right place to rebuild that reputation. Real Sociedad, where Wales manager Chris Coleman was once in charge, have turned to him after a disastrous start to their La Liga campaign which has left them 19th in the table with just six points from 10 games. But the potential at a club which gets regular gates of 24,000-plus and was in the Champions League a year ago could be enough to persuade Moyes he has found the right opportunity to start again. He told Sportsmail recently: ‘I’d like to find a job, if I can, that gives me a chance of being successful. ‘I have always felt it could enhance me as a manager to go abroad, so that is a possibility.’ Real Sociedad are looking for a new manager after Jagoba Arrasate was relieved of his duties .

"It is one of the irritations of modern life. But forking out for printer cartridges may soon be a thing of the past. Epson has launched a cartridge-free printer that uses a refillable ink tank. The machine is the first of its kind in Britain, and the printer manufacturer claims it will cost a fraction of the price to fill it with ink. Scroll down for video . Tokyo-based electronics company Epson has unveiled two new printers that have refillable tanks rather than ink cartridges. In place of costly cartridges they both have an ink reservoir. This can print 4,000 pages in black or 6,500 in colour on one fill. Two printers are on sale, the L355 at £249.99 and the L555 (shown) at £329.99 . How the costs compare of a traditional cartridge wifi printer and a new Eco-tank printer . The catch is that you will have to pay a lot more for the printer – but Epson says it will still work out cheaper in the longer term. Calculations suggest the saving could be more than £100 a year. Until now manufacturers have sold their printers on the cheap, relying on the exorbitant cost of the inkjet cartridges to make a profit. Those cartridges – of which Britons buy 50million a year – contain as little as 3ml of ink. And with many printers needing four cartridges, it can cost £45 to refill them. Both the L355 and L555 have print, copy and scanning functionality. The L555 also has fax, a 30-page Automatic Document Feeder and a two-line LCD screen. They both have Wi-Fi connectivity that can be used with Epson iPrint on smartphones or tablets. Meanwhile the refillable ink tank system, which can print 4,000 pages in black and 6,500 in colour when full, also comes with an Epson warranty of one year or 30,000 pages. But fewer households now own a printer, instead choosing to share photographs and documents on the internet rather than printing them. As a result, the big firms have had to rethink their commercial model, because if people are buying fewer cartridges, firms will not make as much money on them. Epson claims its new EcoTank printers will last two years without running out of ink – based on a household printing 200 pages a month – and will then cost up to £32 to refill. But the tank adds about 25 per cent to the size of the printer. And the printer is more expensive. While a traditional cartridge wifi printer costs £55, the EcoTank L355 retails at £249 and the more advanced L555 at £329. But Mark Reynolds, of Epson, claimed the new system will save the average family a large amount in the long run. ‘We estimate up to 65 per cent savings versus the average across the top ten printers in Western Europe,’ he said. Over two years, this would equate to savings of about £500 per machine, taking into account the initial outlay, he claimed. But by the Daily Mail’s calculations, comparing the Epson EcoTank L355 with the firm’s popular inkjet model, the Epson XP-312 which sells for £55, that saving would be closer to £230. The new printers come with wifi connection, scanner and copier, with the L555 also including a fax. When using the printer for the first time the user will need to pour the ink themselves into the printer’s tank (shown). Epson says this is ‘hassle-free’ using drip-free bottle spouts. Once depleted refills can be bought for £8 - but it has to be Epson's own brand of ink . Purchasing replacement ink cartridges (stock image shown) for existing printers can be a costly and complex process, so the new refillable printers will be welcome new to many .","Tokyo-based electronics company Epson has unveiled two new printers that have refillable tanks rather than ink cartridges .

"A mall Santa and his elf have been fired after they turned away a seven-year-old girl with autism because she was there with her service dog, Pup-Cake. Abcde Santos, whose name is pronounced 'Ab-Suh-Dee', her family and the dog waited in line for 30 minutes to see Santa at The Shops in Mission Viejo, California on Sunday. But as she neared St Nick, he turned her away. 'To her dismay, Santa was afraid of her service dog,' family friend Julie Miller wrote in a statement on the dog's Facebook page. Turned away: Abcde Santos and Pup-Cake (pictured at Halloween) were turned away by Santa, who was scared of the dog, her family said. After they explained he was a service dog, he claimed he had allergies . Miller explained that they believe Pup-Cake, who is a pit bull, was turned away because of 'what we can only assume is the influence of BSL (breed specific legislation)'. 'Those dogs eat people,' the Santa said, according to the family. The family offered to remove Pup-Cake from the building so that Abcde could speak to him or even wave at him from afar, but Santa refused. They explained that Pup-Cake was a trained service dog and was lawfully allowed to be there. Santa then claimed that he had allergies and turned them away, Miller explained on the Facebook page. Heartbroken: The family shared this image showing Abcde sobbing after not being allowed to meet Santa . Best friends: As her service dog, Pup-Cake recognizes when Abcde is becoming distressed . Together: Pup-Cake joined the family in 2009 and they have seen a marked difference in Abcde since . 'For an autistic child to wait in line for 30 minutes, that's an accomplishment in itself,' Miller said. 'Santa still refused to see the child; sending her away heartbroken leaving a family to comfort a child instead of celebrating her accomplishments.' She added that Pup-Cake is a small pit bull who has received Canine Good Citizen training as well as socialization, obedience and public access training. The Santa, whose real name is unknown, and his elf were hired by the mall through an outside agency, The Noerr Programs. Following uproar online, the mall said they would be replacing the Santa 'with one that is more compassionate to our guests' needs.' They were fired on Monday.

'We look forward to welcoming back the Santos family and Pup-Cake for a special Santa experience,' the mall added. The family, who are declining interviews, wants people to know about the Americans with Disabilities Act, which bans discrimination against people with service dogs, Miller told the OC Register. 'They want people to get educated not about autism or pit bulls, but about the disabilities act so that little girls like Abcde won't go and see Santa and end up crying,' Miller said.","Abcde Santos, Pup-Cake and her family waited in line for 30 minutes to meet Santa at a mall in Mission Viejo, California on Sunday .

Loved ones: Morris' girlfriend, Danielle Kelly (right), his mother, Julie (center), and his father, Dan (left), have been by his side at the hospital . ‘My body is responding well,’ Morris said. ‘I'm already sitting up. I'm very fortunate.’ On May 30, the stitches in his arms were removed and he was fitted for prosthetics. The stitches in his legs were removed several days later. Adventurer: Danielle Kelly (right) said he and Morris have always loved water sports and nature . Morris’ sisters, Molly and Claire, have been organizing fundraisers at home. His brother, Riley, is serving in the Iowa National Guard, and his father, Dan, has been at the hospital with his son as often as work permits. Morris has had visits from other wounded warriors; top military personnel, including the commandant of the U.S. Marine Corps; Congressman  Bruce Braley and actor Joe Mantegna, an advocate for returning veterans. While he said that his medical bills are covered, the 23-year-old man with a love of the great outdoors said that he has always dreamed of building a log cabin in the woods on a lake where he could live with his girlfriend, Danielle Kelly. ‘Taylor and I are both savers, and we had been working our butts off to ensure we'd have a cabin, close to water to do water sports, and places we can hike,’ Kelly said. ‘After what happened, we will not abandon that dream if it takes years of saving.’ The Chive invited viewers to make contributions toward Morris’ dream cabin, setting the goal at $30,000, but just 12 hours later, $143,000 had been raised through online donations at TaylorMorris.org.

Then Arsenal players Philippe Senderos, Johan Djourou, Alexander Hleb,  Fabregas, Flamini, Tomas Rosicky, Justin Hoyte and Theo Walcott take tea at London's Buckingham Palace before meeting the Queen in 2007 . ‘I came here when I was 20 and he was couple of years younger, so it’s been 10 years now,’ says the Frenchman, recalling his first meeting with Fabregas. ‘In that time, we’ve experienced a lot. We were in the Champions League final together in 2006. I’ve been fighting for him for many years. ‘When we were together here we had a great partnership on the pitch. He was more offensive and I was more defensive, working hard for him. (On Sunday) I will probably mark him and that will not be easy first of all because he is a good player but also because he is a friend.’ But those regrets. There was that Champions League final in 2006, where Flamini came on for Fabregas as a substitute when 10-man Arsenal were 1-0 up with 16 minutes to go. Two late Barcelona goals scuppered what would have been an extraordinary night. Then there was the 2007-08 season, when Arsenal were five points clear at the top of the Premier League in February before a 2-2 draw at Birmingham City in which Eduardo’s horrific broken leg seemed to break their resolve. Should Fabregas and Flamini have won trophies together? ‘Of course,’ says Flamini. ‘Like I said, when I came back to Arsenal from AC Milan, it was unfinished business, because I always had in my heart, in the back of my mind, the Champions League final of 2006. ‘Then also, in 2008, we were top of the league until late in the season, and we collapsed. We lost one player, a bad injury to Eduardo, so that is a bad memory I keep in the back of my mind. ‘It was difficult, because we lost it easily. In 2008 we had such a strong team and I’m frustrated because of that. I think in my mind I want to clear that up, that’s why I came back to win titles. We started last year, with the FA Cup, and we have big ambition this year.’ It will be hard for Arsenal fans to see Fabregas in blue on Sunday afternoon, especially given the superb start he has made. ‘It will be strange for everybody,’ says Flamini. ‘But it was his decision to go to Chelsea. He’s a good friend of mine so whatever decision he made, I support him. He is a big player.’ Fabregas will be wearing Chelsea blue when he plays against Arsenal on Sunday . And the Spaniard has got off to a cracking start to his Chelsea career with the club still unbeaten this season . The arrival of the likes of Alexis Sanchez, Santi Cazorla and Mesut Ozil prevented the return of Fabregas . For Chelsea, the addition of Fabregas feeding chances to Diego Costa has added a layer of fluency to their attacks which was missing last season. ‘He’s one of the best midfielders in the world,’ says Eden Hazard, another beneficiary of Fabregas’ presence. ‘Diego Costa is right in front of me and it’s very good to play with them. They understand football. It’s easier to play with them. I was happy (when he signed). I play football to play with the best and these are the best players in the world.’ You would imagine Arsenal must now have some regrets, given the option was there to re-sign him. ‘Of course,’ says Hazard. ‘When you can get Fabregas and he goes to another team, you must be frustrated a little bit. But Chelsea are happy.’ Of course, Arsenal have Mesut Ozil, Santi Cazorla, Tomas Rosicky, Aaron Ramsey and Jack Wilshere in central attacking roles. Arsene Wenger’s decision not to pursue Fabregas more determinedly makes perfect logical sense. It is just that emotionally it feels wrong. Fabregas is likely to play in a more attacking role today, rather than the deeper position he has filled so far. Jose Mourinho may look to bolster his midfield with a more defensive player than the Spaniard, something Wenger never seems to be prepared to do. Chelsea’s 6-0 massacre of Arsenal at Stamford Bridge last March, which came in Wenger’s 1000th game for the club, saw the Arsenal manager start with a midfield of Mikel Arteta, Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and Santi Cazorla, which proved hopelessly inadequate. The default excuse for that result is that Kieran Gibbs was sent off (mistakenly, it should have been Oxlade-Chamberlain) after 15 minutes. Yet by then it was already 2-0 and the red card was for a hand ball on the line preventing the third goal. The subsequent penalty would make it 3-0. The sending off had represented the end of the contest, not the turning point. Flamini sat on the bench that day and could only look on, until Wenger brought him on at half time, belatedly acknowledging his error. Flamini says: ‘We collapsed too quickly. After 10 minutes we were already 2-0 down. Arsene Wenger admitted he made mistakes during Arsenal's 6-0 defeat at Chelsea in March . Andre Schurrle is mobbed by his  team-mates after he scored Chelsea's second with just seven minutes gone . Kieran Gibbs was mistakenly shown a red card by referee Mark Clatternburg with only 15 minutes gone . Arsenal players stand dejected as the Chelsea team celebrate their sixth goal of the game . ‘We have learned from our mistake, we are gaining maturity, we have some quality in the team and we go there with a lot of confidence.’ Wenger surely can’t approach the game with the same tactics which have seen his side swept aside by Chelsea time and time again. In the last 10 years, since Mourinho took over at Chelsea for the first time, Arsenal have played their London neighbours 24 times. They have won three, drawn six and lost an incredible 15 times. Wenger has never beaten a Mourinho team. Flamini believes today can be different. ‘When you go there, and you lose the way we did last year, it’s on your mind,’ he admits. ‘(On Sunday) we go there, we give everything. It’s important for every single one of us but also for the fans. I’m sure they remember what happened last year and we really want to make it up.’ For Hazard, of course, there are only good memories. ‘It was fantastic,’ he says. But the Belgian is also looking beyond the derby. ‘We are first and we hope at the end of the season we can stay there,’ he says. ‘I need a trophy. I came to Chelsea for trophies.’ From Chelsea players such statements about the title ring true; from Arsenal players, much less so. Wenger needs to regain credibility in these big games. When the two rivals face each other on Sunday, we will discover whether there has been any real tactical evolution over the summer or whether it is merely ‘plus ca change’, as Wenger might say.

"The holidays are the best time to work in childcare, according to new research which reveals the majority parents in the US are willing to fork out far more cash to nannies and babysitters during the festive season than at any other time of the year. A new survey from childcare website Urban Sitter, which questioned 400 parents about their holiday habits, indicates that 53 per cent confessing that they will spend up to 1.5 times the normal rate during the festive period so that they can enjoy the evening without worrying about their children. According to Urban Sitter's annual childcare rate survey, this means that a babysitter caring for two children in New York City could earn a whopping $25.14 an hour, while those working in San Francisco could rake in $26.52 per hour. Scroll down for video . Lucrative business: Babysitters and nannies are in high demand during the holidays, particularly on New Year's Eve . And that's not the only money that babysitters are set to make this holiday; 34 per cent of people will tip their babysitter between $25 and $50, regardless of what hours they have worked. Unsurprisingly, New Year's Eve was shown to be the busiest night for babysitters and nannies, with 74 per cent of parents admitting that they book childcare for the night at least one month in advance, to ensure their party plans are not disrupted. 10 per cent of those moms and dads included in the survey even admitted to securing their New Year's babysitter more than two months in advance so as not to run into any last-minute childcare nightmares. Full-time nannies also tend to benefit during this time of the year, with three quarters of parents revealing that they offer a minimum of one week's pay as a year-end bonus, with many increasing that to two weeks in light of the festive season. The best time to be a babysitter: Childcare is big business during the holidays . 77 per cent of those surveyed also ensure that they have at least one gift to give their nanny, as a thank you for all their hard work throughout the year. A lucky third of full-time nannies are even given a one-week break from their duties so that they can return home and spend time with their own family and friends. But while parents are willing to shell out big bucks in order to secure and reward their nannies and babysitters during the holidays, many revealed that they are far more frugal when it comes to the presents for their children. 39 per cent said that they spend less that $100 per child on gifts, however one third admitted to forking out between $200 and $500 on their significant other. 53 per cent of parents are willing to spend 1.5 times the babysitter’s normal rate on New Year’s Eve, with 15 per cent willing to shell out 2 times that . 34 per cent of parents tip their babysitter between $25 and $50, regardless of the hourly rate .

"Flamboyant Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison is stepping aside as CEO after 37 years at the helm of the business software maker. It ends a colorful reign marked by his outlandish wealth and penchant for women, yachts, fast cars and mansions. Just months ago Ellison,who was a close friend of Steve Jobs, staged the boating race for America's Cup in the San Francisco Bay, where a team of professional sailors that he personally financed won the trophy for the second straight time. Ellison, 70, intends to still play an influential role at Oracle Corp and remains Oracle's biggest shareholder with a 25 percent stake in the Redwood Shores, California, company that accounts for most of his $51 billion fortune . With the changing of the guard announced Thursday, Ellison will be handing over his job to his two top lieutenants, Safra Catz and Mark Hurd, who become co-CEOs. Ellison, 70, intends to still play an influential role at Oracle Corp. He is taking over as Oracle's executive chairman, replacing Jeff Henley in the position, and will oversee the engineering departments as chief technology officer. What's more, Ellison remains Oracle's biggest shareholder with a 25 percent stake in the Redwood Shores, California, company that accounts for most of his $51 billion fortune. Ellison will keep working full time, Oracle said in a statement. His step back from the top job mirrors his friend Bill Gates at Microsoft, who stepped down as chairman of the software giant earlier this year but remains a board member and adviser to new CEO Satya Nadella. Since he co-founded Oracle with $1,200 of his own money in 1977, Ellison has become has well known for his antics away from the office as his accomplishments as the company's CEO. Through the years, Ellison has driven fancy cars, flown his own jet, raced yachts, wooed beautiful women and owned ornate homes in San Francisco, Malibu and an exclusive Silicon Valley neighborhood, where he spent $170 million on a 45-acre compound designed to remind him of Japan and the samurai warriors that he admires. In 2012, he bought his own Hawaiian island by acquiring 98 percent of Lanai. Last year, Ellison staged the boating race for America's Cup in the San Francisco Bay, where a team of professional sailors that he personally financed won the trophy for the second straight time. Ellison, a close friend of late Apple co-founder Steve Jobs, has always relished his status as the richest person in the nation's high-tech heartland, where free-flowing stock options sometimes turned receptionists and cafeteria workers into millionaires. Money is 'a method of keeping score,' Ellison once told an interviewer. Catz, Oracle's chief financial officer until Thursday, will be responsible for manufacturing, legal and finance, while Hurd will supervise sales and all services. Both of them will report to Oracle's board instead of Ellison. Oracle isn't hiring a CFO to replace Catz. 'I am going to continue to do what I have been doing the past several years and they are going to continue doing what they have been doing the past several years,' Ellison told analysts during a Thursday conference call. Given that Catz and Hurd are already handling many of the same duties as Oracle's co-presidents, the new pecking order may not seem like much of a change, especially among investors who worried about the company's sluggish growth in recent years. Oracle's stock slipped 86 cents, or 2 percent, to $40.69 in Thursday's extended trading following the company's announcement. Just months ago Ellison,who was a close friend of Steve Jobs, staged the boating race for America's Cup in the San Francisco Bay, where a team of professional sailors that he personally financed won the trophy for the second straight time. The downturn may have had more to do with Wall Street's disappointment with Oracle's fiscal first-quarter earnings, which were also announced late Thursday and missed analyst targets, than with the reshuffling of management duties. The shake-up comes at a critical point in Oracle's history. It is trying to adapt to the technological upheaval that is causing more of its corporate customers to lease software applications stored in remote data centers instead of paying licensing fees to install programs on machines kept in their own offices. The shift to Internet-connected software has become known as 'cloud computing.' 'While there was some speculation Larry could step down, the timing is a bit of a head scratcher in our opinion and the Street will have many questions,' said FBR Capital Markets analyst Daniel Ives. Although Ellison has steadfastly insisted that Oracle is well positioned to sell more cloud computing services, smaller rivals such as Salesforce.com Inc. and Workday Inc. have been growing at a much faster clip. Both Salesforce, started by former Oracle executive Marc Benioff, and Workday, founded by longtime Oracle nemesis David Duffield, were created explicitly as cloud computing specialists. In a post on his Twitter account, Benioff cast doubt about whether Ellison is really relinquishing any control. 'There always has been, and always will be, one CEO at Oracle,' Benioff tweeted. Catz, 52, is a former investment banker who joined Oracle in 1999. Hurd, 57, has been with Oracle for four years, but is best known the former CEO of Hewlett-Packard Co. Hurd stepped down from HP in 2010 after that company's board raised questions about his expense reports and his relationship with a company contractor. Ellison ridiculed HP for its treatment of Hurd, a close friend, and hired him at Oracle. 'Safra and Mark are doing a spectacular job and deserve the recognition of their new titles,' Ellison told analysts Thursday.","70 year old Ellison estimated to be worth $51bn .

"The oldest known shell to have been engraved by an early human has been uncovered in a Dutch museum collection, where it remained unnoticed since the 1930s. The ancient mollusc, originally discovered on the island of Java, is between 430,000 and 540,000-years-old, dating to the time Homo erectus inhabited the remote volcanic outpost. The engravings resemble the previously oldest-known etchings, which were created by either Neanderthals or modern humans around 100,000 years ago. The oldest known shell (top) to have been engraved by an early human has been uncovered in a Dutch museum collection, where it remained unnoticed since the 1930s. Pictured here is its polished edge (bottom) The shell has a polished edge and a zigzag pattern of engravings, suggesting it was used from cutting or scraping. If this is the case, it means our ancestors, Homo erectus, were more intelligent than we thought. The successful, long-lived species emerged out of Africa almost two million years ago, and were possibly the first early humans to live in hunter-gather societies they also used rafts to travel the oceans. 'It rewrites human history,' Dr Stephen Munro, a Australian National University paleoanthropologist who made the find, told Business Insider. 'It's evidence that Homo erectus exploited these aquatic food resources, and fits with other evidence that they probably foraged in and around water.' Geometric engravings are considered to be a sign of modern cognitive abilities, but the origins of such behaviour have been debated. The latest analysis of freshwater mollusc shell collected from the Trinil fossil site on Java in the 1890s imply Homo erectus was also capable of 'modern' behaviour. The shell has a polished edge and a zigzag pattern of engravings (shown), suggesting it was used from cutting or scraping. It may mean our ancestors, Homo erectus, were more intelligent than we thought . Geometric engravings are considered to be a sign of modern cognitive abilities, but the origins of such behaviour have been debated. 'It rewrites human history,' said Dr Stephen Munro, a paleoanthropologist at the Australian National University . The team found that Homo erectus were able to open the shells by drilling a hole through the shell with a shark's tooth. This damaged the muscles causing  the valves of the shell to open, so that the contents can be eaten. Dr Josephine Joordens, of Leiden University in The Netherlands, said: 'The manufacture of geometric engravings is generally interpreted as indicative of modern cognition and behaviour. 'Key questions in the debate on the origin of such behaviour are whether this innovation is restricted to Homo sapiens and whether it has a uniquely African origin. 'Here we report on a fossil freshwater shell assemblage from the main bone layer of Trinil - the type locality of Homo erectus discovered by Eugene Dubois in 1891. The engravings inside Gorham's Cave in Gibraltar are the first known examples of Neanderthal rock art . It may look like a cross, but lines scratched into a cave wall could be proof that Neanderthals were more intelligent and creative than previously thought. The cross-hatched engravings inside Gorham's Cave in Gibraltar are the first known examples of Neanderthal rock art. The find is significant because it indicates that modern humans and their extinct cousins shared the capacity for abstract expression, according to a team of scientists who studied the site. Experts examined and described the grooves in a rock that had been covered with sediment in the study published in the PNAS journal. Archaeologists had previously found artefacts associated with Neanderthal culture laid over the top of the artwork, suggesting that the engravings must be older, said Professor Clive Finlayson, director of heritage at the Gibraltar Museum. 'The production of purposely made painted or engraved designs on cave walls is recognised as a major cognitive step in human evolution - considered exclusive to modern humans, he said. The latest analysis of the freshwater mollusc shell (shown) collected from the Trinil fossil site on Java in the 1890s imply Homo erectus was also capable of 'modern' behaviour . 'In the Dubois collection in the Natural History Museum in Leiden we found evidence for freshwater shellfish consumption by hominins, one unambiguous shell tool and a shell with a geometric engraving. 'Together our data indicate the engraving was made by Homo erectus and it is considerably older than the oldest geometric engravings described so far. 'Although it is at present not possible to assess the function or meaning of the engraved shell this discovery suggests that engraving abstract patterns was in the realm of Asian Homo erectus cognition and neuromotor control.' The ability to make and use tools dates back millions of years. Chimpanzees - our closest living relatives - can devise spear-like weapons for hunting and create specialised tool kits for foraging ants. This suggests our family tree could have possessed wooden tools since the ancestors of humans and chimps diverged some four million years ago.

"Hope: Scientists believe the new treatment could one day help people regain movements lost due to spinal cord injuries . A drug could restore the gift of movement to millions of people paralysed in car crashes, sporting accidents and falls, doctors believe. The chemical has shown ‘extraordinary promise’ when given to rats with severely damaged spinal cords. Some animals went from being barely able to take a step to being able to walk almost as well as healthy creatures. They also became more nimble and regained control of their bladder muscles. Overall, 21 of the 26 animals improved on the drug – an unparalleled success rate. The study, published in the journal Nature, was partly funded by the US government’s health research arm – the National Institutes of Health. Researcher Jerry Silver, a professor of neuroscience at Cape Western Reserve University, Ohio, said: ‘This recovery is unprecedented. ‘Each of the 21 animals got something back in terms of function. ‘For any spinal cord-injured patient today, it would be considered extraordinary to regain even one of those functions. ‘We’re very excited at the possibility that millions of people could, one day, regain movements lost due to spinal cord injuries.’ Dr Lyn Jakeman, from the US government’s health research arm, said: ‘There are currently no drug therapies available that improve the very limited natural recovery from spinal cord injuries that patients experience. ‘This is a great step towards identifying a novel agent for helping people recover.’ Each year, thousands of people around the world lose the ability to walk after road accidents damage the spinal cord, blocking the transmission of vital messages between the brain and legs. Many more are left paralysed after falls and sporting accidents. Many people will see slight improvements in their condition initially but most will be left with some sort of disability. Breakthrough: The drug, known as intracellular sigma peptide, has shown ‘extraordinary promise’ when given to rats with severely damaged spinal cords (a spinal cord section is pictured) The most severely injured will have lost the use of all their limbs and be unable to breathe without the help of a respirator. The new drug, which is known as intracellular sigma peptide, or ISP, helps damaged nerve cells regenerate, allowing vital messages to be passed to the muscles. Normally, when they try to grow across a scarred and damaged spinal cord, their path is blocked by glue-like chemicals. ISP, which is given as a daily injection, sticks to the chemicals instead, allowing the nerves to grow and grow. When rats with badly damaged spinal cords were given a shot of the drug every day for seven weeks and their ability walk, balance and control their bladder muscles monitored. Remarkably, some of the animals saw improvement in all three skills. Dr Silver said: ‘We set a very high bar to be considered to have “recovered”. ‘Some animals moved so well that they could hardly be distinguished from normal. ‘This is very promising. We now have an agent that may work alone or in combination with other treatments to improve the lives of many.’ Further research is needed to understand why the drug worked on some animals and not on others. ISP is also being tested on other conditions in which scarred tissue hinders recovery, including heart attacks.","New drug, known as intracellular sigma peptide, or ISP, helps damaged nerve cells regenerate, allowing vital messages to be passed to  muscles .

"Armed police in grey and blue uniforms cluster every few yards along Avenue Interlagos, the wide and teeming road leading to the track on which Lewis Hamilton has tasted almost equal measures of euphoria and dejection. The journey in carries a frisson of fear. Favelas - the giant shanty towns of deprived millions - stand on either side of the street. And out of those shacks can run gun-toting criminals to hold up cars that stop when the lights turn red. Barely a year passes without someone from the Formula One community being robbed or shot at. Lewis Hamilton says he has no fears as he battles for the Formula One Drivers' World Championship . Hamilton goes into Sunday's Brazil Grand Prix with a 24-point lead over Mercedes team-mate Nico Rosberg . Inside Interlagos, home of Sunday’s Brazilian Grand Prix, is far less dangerous than outside, but the old crumpled place still possesses the most intimidating atmosphere in world motor racing. The four stands along the pit straight turn into cacophonous pits of hate, of hissing and whistling, jeering and cheering, as the cars line up to race. Hamilton knows this well. The crowd’s enmity poured down on him when he was in a title fight with a Paulista, Felipe Massa, in 2008. That year he triumphed unforgettably by passing the Toyota car of Timo Glock to finish fifth on the final, rainy lap. He had atoned for his late-season collapse 12 months earlier. So here we are again with Hamilton on the cusp of world championship glory. He leads Nico Rosberg, his fellow Mercedes man, by 24 points with only Abu Dhabi awaiting him after Sunday’s race. But this time he is visibly relaxed and scared of nobody. Lewis Hamilton has some good memories racing in Brazil - winning the  Drivers' World Championship in 2008 . ‘I don’t have any fears,’ he declared. ‘Honestly, you can look in my eyes, I don’t have any fears. I feel like where I am today is not down to luck. There are reasons why we have the best car today and why we’ve had the results this year. That’s all the hard work that’s gone in. ‘In these last two races I’m going to do everything I can do, and whatever the result at the end of it, it’s the way it is, but I will know I did everything I could.’ In normal circumstances Hamilton would win the title here if he finished ahead of Rosberg, thus rendering the Abu Dhabi race in a fortnight irrelevant. But, no, points at Abu Dhabi count double. This new rule is a skewing of the sport’s integrity - please don’t laugh - and robs Sunday's race of a potential championship outcome before a wheel is turned in anger. Rosberg (pictured) and Hamilton's relationship has been tumultuous at times as they battle for the title . Rosberg can win the title at Abu Dhabi regardless of Hamilton's position in Brazil due to offer of double points . Abu Dhabi is an awful venue, double scoring or not. It is synthetic. The track is puny. The weather is predictably dry. There is no natural audience. A lot of ‘B2B’ (business to business) transactions take place in the oversized hospitality blocks but that hardly compensates for the place’s manifest inadequacies. But the Abu Dhabi rulers have written a cheque the size of the desert, c/o Mr BC Ecclestone of London SW7, in exchange for the privilege of staging the finale - and that, my capitalist friends, is that. There is simply no use arguing that Interlagos’ undulating track with its history and its fan base and its capricious weather should have that honour. Bernie Ecclestone (left) has been criticised for damaging the integrity of the sport with the double points race . Hamilton knows how special Brazilian motor racing is, being an aficionado of Ayrton Senna, an icon who appealed to the rich and poor of his nation alike. Governments come and go - former Marxist guerrilla Dilma Rousseff has just been re-elected, supposedly, with 51 per cent of the vote - but Senna’s status endures. He is buried on a grassy knoll up the road at the Morumbi graveyard. The road from Guarulhos airport into the sprawl of the city bears his name. And only this week, a giant portrait comprising a patchwork of his family’s denim jeans was unveiled at the Ayrton Senna Institute. ‘When I was younger,’ said Hamilton, ‘I used to put on this one particular video of Ayrton, Racing Is In My Blood. I watched that God knows how many times. He really inspired me as a kid and he still does today. Every now and then someone may mention my name in the same sentence as his, and I feel really proud and honoured by that. ‘I come here and I still feel his presence. He still lives on through his fans and the country. It’s one of the most special things I’ve ever seen. I met his niece this week and she said his mum is a fan, which is amazing.’ Aryton Senna won three Drivers' World Championships before his untimely death in May 1994 . Caterham have called on fans to donate £2.35million to save them from closure, the fate that befell fellow strugglers Marussia on Friday. Administrators announced that Marussia’s 200 staff at their factory in Banbury, Oxfordshire, had been made redundant. It is believed the team, whose driver Jules Bianchi remains critical but stable after his accident in Japan, had debts of £31m. Caterham, who owe £16m, have launched an ambitious crowdfunding project to try to raise funds to compete at the final race in Abu Dhabi. They will offer ‘rewards’ in return for donations. The minimum pledge is £10. By last night they had raised more than £100,000 towards their £2.35m target.

The Kurdish fighters of Kobane, backed by a small number of Iraqi peshmerga forces and Syrian rebels, are locked in what they say is a fight to the end against ISIS, which swept into the town in mid-September. The militants' advance was part of a summer blitz after the Islamic State group overran large parts of Syria and neighboring Iraq. Kobane, which once had a population of about 50,000, has seen some of the fiercest urban warfare in Syria's civil war, now in its fourth year, and has paid a heavy price for battling the Islamic State extremists. Desolation: A ruined shop front hints at what the town was like before it became the site of fierce and prolonged fighting . Remnants of a more civilised time: A gutted police car is among the dozens of destroyed and abandoned vehicles gathering dust in the town . Fearsome: In this November 19 photo, a Kurdish fighter shows the extent of the damage from a truck bomb in Kobane . It's so big that it has to be supported on two tripods and fires ammunition that's three times the size of standard rifle ammo. An Isis terrorist has been photographed aiming a 10-foot long sniper rifle out of a flat window in Kobane. The fearsome weapon fires 23mm calibre bullets, far larger than the standard size. Huge casings from the bullets can be seen on the floor next to the gunman. What sort of effect this gun would have remains open to debate, however, according to firearms expert David Dyson. He told MailOnline: 'The problem with identifying the effect of this gun is firstly that we don't know for sure what the calibre is, although there wouldn't be a lot of point in building something like this if it wasn't of a significant calibre. Secondly, and probably of more importance, we don't know how well it is made: is the barrel accurately machined and rifled? 'The effect will also depend on the type of ammunition used. These rounds exist [23mm] fitted with high explosive incendiary or armour piercing incendiary projectiles.They will be effective against personnel and vehicles including lightly armoured ones.' The picture emerged after a show of force from al Qaeda's Nusra Front, a rival group. Aref and the others at the Kobane clinic say the immobility of their facility slows them down, since they cannot venture far outside and treat the wounded at the scene - as paramedics and mobile doctors elsewhere do in combat situations. Still, Aref is dedicated to saving Kobane's wounded as best he can and dreams of someday rebuilding the town clinics and working in a safe operating theater. Helped by more than 270 airstrikes from a U.S.-led coalition and an American airdrop of weapons, the fighters in Kobane have succeeded in halting the militants' advance and believe that a corner has been turned. But the fight against the Islamic State is not slowing down. 'We know that the number (of wounded) will increase and more injured will come so we have to be ready,' said Aref. 'The most important thing for us is having an operating room.'

Desperate: families take shelter from fighting between Kurdish fighters and Islamic State militants on in the buffer zone in Kobane, Syria, close to the Turkish border . In a previous report Simkin spoke to a teenage girl who's fighting Isis in Kobane with her father. Pervin Kobani is part of a team holding an eastern front-line position that comes under regular attack from the extremist fighters. Three weeks ago, Pervin bumped into her father on a street corner. She was surprised to see him holding a gun. She didn't know that he too had decided to fight. Her mother is a refugee in Turkey, her only brother studying in Algeria. 'Honestly when I heard my father is fighting on the western front with the YPG I was so proud of him, and it made me want to fight more,' she said.","The clinic is the only one left standing in the war-ravaged town that has become a symbol for Syrian civil war .

"It is the spot where Bram Stoker dreamt up Dracula’s bloodthirsty tale. Gazing at Whitby’s rugged coastline and ruined Abbey, the Irish writer here felt inspired to pen his 1897 Gothic novel. But now health and safety officials have killed off the dramatic view by driving a number of wooden stakes through it – to erect a fence directly in front of a commemorative bench.

Historic: The commemorative bench records Bram Stoker's link to the sleepy Yorkshire seaside town . Stoker's view: A peer over the fence reveals that historic and scenic skyline that enchanted the Irish author . Stoker visited Whitby in 1890 to decide whether it would be suitable for a family holiday. But he was apparently so taken with the atmosphere of the seaside town – the red roofs, Whitby Abbey and the bats flying around the many churches –  that he used it as the setting for the book.

The North Yorkshire seaside town relies on its connection to Count Dracula to boost its tourist trade and the council’s decision to erect the 4ft barrier for ‘public safety’ has been widely condemned. A plaque on the bench reads: ‘The view from this spot inspired Bram Stoker (1847-1912) to use Whitby as the setting of part of his world-famous novel Dracula.’ The move comes a month after safety barriers were erected on the sea wall, ruining the view from adjacent beach huts. Harry Collett, chairman of Whitby and District Tourism Association, said: ‘I would like to know how many people have fallen off there since the 1830s. 'They seem to be going bonkers over this health and safety.’ The town’s Mayor John Freeman, added: ‘It’s a most unsightly structure. 'It’s horrendous, farmers would put a better fence up than that. It’s just hideous.’ A council spokesman said emergency work had been carried out following a recent collapse of a section of cliff. She said public safety was of paramount importance.","Seat marks the spot where Bram Stoker was inspired to write Dracula .

"Bizarre and brilliant cosmetic treatments were big news in 2013 with the vampire facial, which involves drawing the patient’s own blood and then injecting it back into the face, topping the most requested list. The facial, made famous by fans Kim Kardashian and supermodel Bar Refaeli, saw an 800 per cent increase last year and it seems that surgeons can't get enough of the bloody treatment. So popular and effective has it become that cosmetic doctors are using the technique on patient's hair to help stimulate growth. Scroll down for video . Famous fans: The vampire facial, which involves drawing the patient's own blood, separating the layer that is filled with platelets and then injecting it back into the face, is loved by Kim Kardashian, left, and Bar Refaeli, and now it is available for your hair too . The procedure, named Platelet Rich Plasma Therapy (PRP), is being used on the scalp as it can apparently stimulate dormant hair follicles and encourage them to start growing again. It is a potential form of treatment for men or women who suffer with hair loss either through genetic predisposition, hormonal issues, trauma or alopecia. So how does it work? The treatment, which takes around an hour and a half, involves taking four syringes of the patient’s blood and putting it in a centrifuge (a rotating piece of medical equipment) to separate the plasma from the red blood cells - this is the same technique as PRP for the face. Local anaesthetic injections are then injected into the scalp, which will ensure the area is numb. How does it work? Named Platelet Rich Plasma Therapy (PRP), it is being used on the scalp as it can stimulate dormant hair follicles and encourage them to start growing again. This shows a 31-year-old patient before, right, and after, left, one treatment . Effective: It takes around an hour and a half and involves taking four syringes of the patient's blood and putting it in a  rotating piece of medical equipment to separate the plasma from the red blood cells; it costs £1,300 . The scalp is then stimulated with a dermaroller. Once the syringes are ready, the PRP is injected into the scalp - primarily in the areas of concern. The patient then has to use the dermaroller every day for around a month at home following the treatment. Absolute Aesthetics Clinical Director Vicki Smith, who recently completed her training and has just started offering the treatment, said: 'It is quite common not to see any changes for six weeks and then you should start to feel the hair becoming thicker in the treated areas. Homecare: The patient, pictured is a 40-year-old, is given a dermaroller to use on their head every day for around a month at home following the treatment . 'The optimum results can be seen at three months. At this stage it is decided whether a second treatment is required or not.' This treatment can be used as a standalone treatment or alongside a hair transplant procedure (usually one month pre-procedure). It is not widely available in the UK yet but Vicki Smith believes it will be big news. You'll have to start saving though because a single treatment will set you back £1,300. Dr Yannis Alexandrides, MD at 111 Harley Street, said: 'PRP to treat hair loss has been championed by many surgeons quietly for the past few years, and studies underway are showing promising results that the procedure does stimulate the growth of new hair follicles. 'Patients should keep in mind that PRP is not be considered as alternative to a hair transplant, in fact the two procedures combined provide optimum results for thinning hair. 'The role of PRP in hair restoration is to stimulate inactive or newly implanted hair follicles into an active growth phase, and this treatment should be repeated (number of treatments will vary per case) during the re growth stage following the hair transplant.'","Platelet Rich Plasma Therapy (PRP) being used on the scalp .

"The controversial double-points system introduced into Formula One for the past season has been abandoned after just one year. And the sport is set for a potentially record-breaking 21-race schedule in 2015 with the Korean Grand Prix surprisingly re-emerging on the calendar. Earlier this year a record-equalling 20-grand prix calendar was unveiled, matching the exhausting number of events set in 2012. But following a meeting of the World Motor Sport Council in Doha, Qatar, it has emerged there may now be 21 races next year. Sebastian Vettel won the last South Korean Grand Prix held in 2013 - while at Red Bull . The World Motor Sport Council ratified a decision taken to scrap double points following a meeting of the Formula One Commission in Geneva last week. The scheme was introduced at the behest of supremo Bernie Ecclestone in an effort to prolong the life of a championship and attract high television audiences through to the final race. Ecclestone's original concept was for the final three races to carry double points, but it was decided at last year's meeting of the WMSC the system would only be employed for the closing grand prix. Upon its announcement the decision was greeted with overwhelming condemnation by fans, whilst drivers past and present also voiced their disapproval. 2014 World Champion Lewis Hamilton will be looking to record his first win at the South Korea Grand Prix . Mar 15 - Australia . Mar 29 - Malaysia . Apr 12 - China . Apr 19 - Bahrain . May 3 - Korea (TBC) May 10 - Spain . May 24 - Monaco . Jun 7 - Canada . Jun 21 - Austria . Jul 5 - Great Britain . Jul 19 - Germany . Jul 26 - Hungary . Aug 23 - Belgium . Sep 6 - Italy . Sep 20 - Singapore . Sep 27 - Japan . Oct 11 - Russia . Oct 25 - United States . Nov 1 - Mexico . Nov 15 - Brazil . Nov 29 - Abu Dhabi . The recent campaign would still have gone to the wire with the final race in Abu Dhabi even if there had been no double points on offer. Lewis Hamilton, however, could have lost the title on double points to Mercedes team-mate Nico Rosberg if a certain set of circumstances had unfolded. Mercifully for Hamilton he emerged victorious, claiming his 11th win of the year, and with it his second world championship. Following a four-year run after its debut in 2010, the Korea GP - staged in Mokpo at the southern tip of South Korea - dropped off the calendar for this season due to a lack of funds and poor attendances. It was suggested at the time the race would be unlikely to make a return, but it has been given a ‘to be confirmed’ date of May 3, just a week ahead of the Spanish Grand Prix. A minor tweak to the start of the calendar sees Malaysia now a stand-alone race on March 29 rather than back to back with Bahrain. The race at the Sakhir circuit is now on April 19 and twinned with China, which will be staged a week before on April 12. Given the teams had previously complained about Singapore-Japan being back to back in September, and that has been retained, it is unlikely they will wear the prospect of four grands prix in five weekends across April and May, with Korea now shoehorned in. Hamilton is paraded in front of the world's media after celebrating his 2014 world championship triumph . Following the WMSC's meeting in Qatari capital Doha, it has also been decided there will be no standing restarts behind the safety car. The F1 Commission voted in the idea earlier this year, but following a thorough review of the potential difficulties that, too, has been axed. The WMSC has agreed, however, to the introduction of the 'virtual safety car' (VSC) which was successfully piloted at the end of practice sessions at recent grands prix. Jules Bianchi suffered a life-threatening accident at the Japanese Grand Prix in early October . The system arose following Jules Bianchi's accident at the Japanese Grand Prix in early October, with the Frenchman still in hospital in Nice as he recovers from severe head injuries. The FIA quickly reviewed how best to control a driver's speed during incidents where a safety car is not required, deciding the VSC, where a speed limit is imposed around the track, to be the ideal solution. A statement from the WMSC read: 'Following tests of the VSC system at the final events of 2014 the introduction of the system has been approved for 2015. 'The VSC procedure may be initiated to neutralise a race upon the order of the clerk of the course. 'It will normally be used when double-waved yellow flags are needed on any section of track and competitors or officials may be in danger, but the circumstances are not such as to warrant use of the safety car itself.'","South Korea Grand Prix will be the fifth race of the season on May 3 .

"A guru who ordered 400 of his followers to undergo castrations he said would bring them closer to God is under investigation by police in India. The country's top crime fighting agency registered a case against Gurmeet Ram Rahim - known as the 'guru in bling' for his penchant for garish clothes and jewellery - over the operations at his ashram. The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) said Rahim is being investigated for criminal intimidation and causing grievous bodily hurt after an alleged 400 castrations were carried out. Scroll down for video . 'Guru in bling': Gurmeet Ram Rahim is being probed by India's Central Bureau of Investigation after a former follower alleged he ordered 400 men to submit to castrations he said would bring them closer to god . The guru, who heads the Dera Sacha Sauda organisation based in Haryana state, is already facing trial for conspiracy over the murder of a journalist in 2002, as well as with claims of sexually exploiting female followers. The latest case was filed after one of his devotees, Hansraj Chauhan, lodged a complaint in court alleging he was manipulated into having the 'painful' operation at the ashram. 'They were told that only those who get castrated will be able to meet god,' Mr Chauhan's lawyer, Navkiran Singh, told AFP. 'We will put all the facts of the case to the court and seek compensation for the victims.' Mr Singh said doctors carried out the castrations over a period from 2000, but for years his client had been too scared to come forward. The court asked the CBI to carry out an investigation into the alleged castrations. The Times of India reports that Mr Chauhan said he was castrated at Rahim's ashram by doctors acting on the guru's orders. A court-mandated medical examination determined that Mr Chauhan had indeed been surgically castrated. Rahim, 47, yesterday hit back at the accusations, telling a press conference convened to plug his new movie he is considering legal action of his own against his accusers. 'Such allegations disturb me, when I am doing good for humanity. Therefore me and my legal advisor are going to move the court challenging the allegations,' said Rahim. Colourful: The guru, who heads the Dera Sacha Sauda organisation in Haryana state, is already facing trial for conspiracy over the 2002 murder of a journalist, as well as with claims of sexually exploiting female followers . The Dera Sacha Sauda says it is a social welfare and spiritual organisation with millions of followers in India and broad. On its website, the group describes Rahim as a saint as well as an author, inventor, scientist, philosopher, philanthropist, peace activist and 'the ultimate humanitarian'. Rahim stars in an action movie to be released later this month called 'MSG: Messenger of God' in which the guru fights criminals, sings songs and is shown dousing himself in water in slow motion after a rugby game. India has been rocked by numerous scandals involving popular godmen who are mostly Hindu ascetics claiming to possess mystical powers. In November, police arrested Baba Rampal Maharaj after a long and violent siege at his ashram in Haryana when he refused to comply with court orders in a murder case. In a bizarre case, devotees of a dead guru are fighting a court battle in Punjab state to preserve his body in a freezer, insisting he is only meditating. For many Indians, gurus play an integral role in daily life. They say they offer a pathway to enlightenment in return for spiritual devotion and often give donations to ashrams, temples and charity projects.","Gurmeet Ram Rahim is already facing trial over the murder of a journalist .

"A senior U.S. Army officer who works closely with high-ranking staff in the office of the Secretary of Defense told MailOnline on Wednesday that outgoing Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel is 'relieved' to be leaving the Pentagon. At a coffee shop a half-mile from the Pentagon, the officer said Hagel complained regularly about having to publicly defend President Barack Obama's military policies and priorities, a job requirement he's eager to leave behind. He described Hagel as 'a good guy who ultimately looked in the mirror one day and realized he couldn’t hold his nose anymore.' 'He jumped at the chance to get out, and couldn't wait to announce it so things didn't go more to hell in Iraq and he’d get blamed for it.’ SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . WINTER OF HIS DISCONTENT: Outgoing Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel couldn't wait to leave, a high-ranking Pentagon officer says, because he tired of carrying President Obama's water . NEXT 'YES-MAN': Former Deputy Secretary Ashton Carter is expected to be nominated by President Obama to succeed Chuck Hagel as Secretary of Defense . The officer agreed to be quoted anonymously because he is not authorized to speak publicly. It's highly unusual for an active-duty officer to speak so plainly. Media reports last week largely repeated whispers from inside the White House, concluding that Obama asked for Hagel's resignation because he slow-walked the emptying of the Guantanamo Bay military prison, which is used to house suspected international terrorists. But CNN reported Tuesday that Hagel himself accelerated his departure. 'He wanted to move quickly,' a Hagel confidante told the network. After months of frustration with the White House, that source said, Hagel wanted to 'at least control his departure.' His farewell ceremony, which Hagel himself forced the White House to hold before Obama settled on a successor, was a study in contrasts. While Obama praised him as a former enlisted soldier who spilled 'blood and treasure' and made 'sacrifices' on the battlefield – and turned to look directly at him frequently – Hagel himself stared ahead and made no eye contact. MailOnline's Defense Department insider explained Hagel's detached nature as the product of presiding over a Pentagon in disarray and distrustful of its commander-in-chief. ‘No one wants to be disloyal,' he said. 'But also nobody wants to be on watch while the Defense Department weakens to the point of disintegrating, and America gets pushed around the [global] schoolyard. It’s embarrassing.’ Asked for an assessment of former Deputy Secretary Ashton Carter, now the odds-on lock to succeed Hagel, he said the rank and file like him personally. 'He's a personable guy – not warm, exactly, but clear-headed and genuine.' But the rank-and-file expect Carter to be Obama's next 'Yes-man,' he said – which worries them. TEARS OF RELIEF? Hagel 'couldn't wait to announce it,' a source said, 'so things didn't go more to hell in Iraq and he’d get blamed for it' ‘The ISIS war isn’t going well, we’re being weakened with budget cuts and troop draw-downs, and we can hardly float a navy anymore,' he explained. 'It’s clear the president is doing this intentionally, and he’s looking for someone new to rubber stamp him.’ Arizona Republican Sen. John McCain, who ran unsuccessfully against Obama for the presidency in 2008, told a radio interviewer on the day Hagel announced his departure that he had recently spoken with the defense secretary – and the topic turned to their mutual displeasure with the White House. 'I know Chuck was frustrated with aspects of the administration's national security policy and decision making process,' McCain told News Talk 550-AM. 'His predecessors have spoken about the excessive micro-management they faced from the White House and how that made it more difficult to do their jobs successfully.Chuck's situation was no different.'","Senior officer close to the office of the Secretary of Defense told MailOnline that the outgoing secretary was 'relieved' to part ways with the White House .

"Five years to the day since his arrest in Cuba on espionage charges, Alan Gross' wife has declared that the former U.S. government subcontractor  is 'done for'. 'I am afraid that we are at the end. After five years of literally wasting away, Alan is done,' Judy Gross said in a statement, adding that her 65-year-old husband now appears gaunt, hobbling and missing five teeth. Cuba arrested the Washington D.C. resident on December 3, 2009, and later convicted him to 15 years in prison for importing banned technology and trying to establish clandestine internet service for Cuban Jews. Happier times: Alan Gross with his wife Judy before his arrest on December 3, 2009 - Cuba convicted him to 15 years in jail for importing banned technology and trying to set up clandestine web service for Cuban Jews . Gross' fate now largely hinges on Obama trying to improve ties between Cuba and the U.S. 'It is time for President Obama to bring Alan back to the United States now; otherwise it will be too late,' his wife urged this week. In light of Gross' five-year anniversary behind bars, the White House called on Cuba for his release, with press secretary Josh Earnest saying in a press release that the U.S. remains 'deeply concerned' about the American's health. Earnest said Gross' release 'would remove an impediment to more constructive relations' between the two countries. The case is emblematic of bitter U.S.-Cuban relations dating to the 1959 revolution that brought Fidel Castro to power, and any potential breakthrough appears remote while Gross is still in prison. As he recently did on immigration, Obama could move without congressional approval to relax U.S. rules that require most Americans wanting to visit Cuba to go on expensive, organized trips with U.S.-approved agendas. Such a change could generate hundreds of millions of dollars a year for Cuba's centrally planned economy, which is struggling for cash in the absence of major expansions in foreign investment or private economic activity. Cuban authorities this week sharply downgraded their prediction of 2014 growth to 1.3 per cent, nearly a point lower than expected at the beginning of the year. Bring him home: Supporters rally on behalf of imprisoned US citizen Alan Gross - his fate now largely hinges on Obama trying to improve ties between Cuba and the U.S. Observers in both countries warn, however, that expectations of imminent progress have come and gone before without real change to relations that have been tense for more than five decades. 'We won't make enough progress obviously until he's home,' U.S. State Department spokeswoman Marie Harf said of Gross on Tuesday. 'His continued incarceration represents a significant impediment to a more constructive bilateral relationship.' Gross' wife, Judy, said in a written statement that the contractor has lost more than 100 pounds, can barely walk due to chronic pain, and has lost five teeth and much of the sight in his right eye. The married father-of-one has begun refusing to see his family and members of Cuba's small Jewish community, who had been visiting him on religious holidays. Backers in the U.S. said Gross has begun discussing a hunger strike, a tactic he has used in the past. 'He hasn't been seeing anyone for a while,' said David Prinstein, vice president of the Havana-based Jewish community association. Prinstein said he hoped Gross would accept a visit for Hannukah celebrations this month. 'We maintain our hope that he will see us and keep his Jewish faith alive, and his faith that maybe this coming year he can return to his country,' Prinstein said.","Alan Gross was arrested in Cuba on December 3 2009 while working covertly in the Communist-run country to set up Internet access .

"David Cameron admitted that he suspects the recent devastating floods across the country were the result of climate change. He was asked yesterday about the extreme weather over the New Year which saw 60mph winds,  torrential rain and tidal waves that left eight people dead and hundreds of homes under water. But his comments at Prime Minister’s Questions will infuriate some Tory backbenchers who do not accept global warming is affecting Britain’s weather. Scroll down for videos .

U.S. and blows their remnants across the Atlantic. In a typical winter, . the jet stream travels at 100mph. This year it reached 230mph. The . Met Office predicts that wintry weather will replace the storms next . week. Spokesman Laura Young  said: ‘Into the weekend and next week we . are going to see temperatures return to normal levels for this time of . year which will make it feel a lot colder and bring a risk of frost, . fog, and wintry showers.’ Bone breaker: A surfer near Newquay in Cornwall comes to grief in the huge swell .

The . dramatic change in the weather may be driven by a freezing front from . the Arctic moving steadily south over the next few days and meeting . warmer, wetter air currently hovering over the UK. Meanwhile, ministers have ordered a major review of the way the aftermath of the storms was handled, which will be presented to Parliament within a month. It will also examine whether planned cuts to the budget of the Environment Agency will undermine its ability to protect flood defences in future. Millions of people across the south of England have been told to prepare for more flooding this week, with rivers in Hampshire, Wiltshire, Dorset, Somerset, Surry, Berkshire, Oxfordshire and the Midlands on alert.

There were 102 flood warnings and 181 flood alerts in place, although none of them were deemed severe, which would carry a danger to life. Labour has called on the government to publish a report by the end of this month giving a ‘full assessment of the future capability of our flood defences and flood response agencies, and whether the investment plans in place are equal to the need for events of this kind’. Labour leader Ed Miliband said: ‘Some people felt the response time was too slow.’ He demanded to know ‘why it took so long for the energy distribution companies to restore power to homes over the Christmas period and what steps do you believe can be taken to ensure that kind of things does not happen again’.","Hundreds of flood warnings and alerts placed across the country .

"A 32-year-old model who held the record for the world's largest implants has walked away from a car crash after her breasts acted as an airbag. Sheyla Hershey, who has 38KKK breasts, was driving home near Houston, Texas, after a Super Bowl party on Sunday when she crashed into a tree. The mother was charged with drunk-driving after the incident and allegedly was not wearing a seatbelt when she lost control of her Ford Mustang. Huge assets: Sheyla Hershey, who has 38KKK breasts, was driving home to Houston, Texas, after a Super Bowl party on Sunday when she crashed into a tree . 'I think my breasts saved my life,' she told Barcroft Media. 'The accident was bad and my boobs are sore, . but they protected the rest of me.' Her car spun around and hit a tree . during the crash but she denied the drunk-driving charge in court on . Monday, reported the Daily Mirror. Despite the crash Hershey, who once had 38MMM breasts, avoided injury because her huge bust protected the rest of her body from harm. She claimed she doesn't ever drink alcohol and passed the breathalyser test issued by police, reported the New York Post. She told Radar Online that she took . drugs for her bipolar, depression, headaches and backaches, which may . have caused the confusion. Mugshot: Hershey's car spun around and hit a tree during the crash but she denied the drunk-driving charge in court on Monday . Texas law states you can be charged with driving while intoxicated if you are impaired by drugs or legal medications even within the legal limit. 'I think my breasts saved my life.

An infection that set in after her 30th . breast enlargement operation led 5ft 3in Hershey to undergo an emergency . operation in June 2010. That left her with unattractive sagging skin where her implants had been, but she was obsessed with maintaining her Guinness World Record. 'Not having my breasts was killing me, I didn't know if I could make it through 2012 without them,' Hershey said last November. 'My breasts had become part of me and I was deformed without them. It is a miracle. I never thought I would have my breasts back again.'

She ignored the wishes of doctors and her . husband Derek, 29 - who all feared the trauma of yet more surgery could . cause a new infection. Hershey organised a tour of cosmetic surgery practitioners in Latin America last September and went to Cancun, Mexico, for the operation. She had 2,500cc of saline liquid implanted into her breasts, before having more saline gradually introduced in her hometown of Vitoria, Brazil. 'I increased slowly over a two-month period and now my breasts are back at 4,300cc of liquid and are 38KKK,' Hershey said.

"Human brains might have a 3D GPS system which allows us to navigate around unfamiliar surroundings,  scientists have claimed. They say we may possess cells that enable us to keep track of our direction, which can become disorientated when we come out of a subway station, for example. And further understanding of the system could help us deal with effects such as vertigo. A study by researchers from the Weizmann Institute of Science in Israel found that mammals have head-direction cells that work like a 3D compass system. Researchers believe that humans might posses similar type of orientation cells. The findings could help pilots cope with the effects of vertigo (stock image shown) The study, led by graduate student Arseny Finkelstein at the Weizmann Institute of Science in Rehovot, Israel and published in Nature, looked at cells in the brains of bats. Earlier work by Dr Nachum Ulanovsky of the same institution had showed that bats possessed 'place' and 'grid' cells that work like a GPS system to keep track of their position. That is similar to what is found in rodents, suggesting humans, too, also had the ability to map their position in 3D space. 'We think that this work can be relevant to other mammals, including humans,' Mr Finkelstein told MailOnline. 'There is some evidence the human mind might have a similar system, but the exact mechanism of is still unknown. Earlier this year a study suggested that bees rely on a built-in ‘sat nav’ system to find their way around. Honeybees were found to make ‘mental maps’ of their home ranges allowing them to pinpoint destinations miles away from their hives. While humans, sharks and even pigeons are known to use this technique, it was popularly thought that bees rely solely on the sun’s position to find their way back to their hive. Dr James Cheeseman of Auckland University in New Zealand, said: ‘Only 50 years ago the claim any non-human animal had a cognitive map was deeply controversial because it suggested a computational theory of mind. The question of whether insects do is a frontier question.’ 'Our research is the first in mammalian species that identifies this 3D system in the brain.' The study of a bat brain shed light on how mammals orient themselves in complex environments by relying on neurons that work in three dimensions. This system acts as an internal compass that gives animals - including humans - a continuous sense of direction and location as they move around. They found certain cells respond to the bats' horizontal and vertical orientation and these so-called head-direction cells track direction in three dimensions as the bats manoeuvre. These cells create a doughnut-shaped, 3D neural compass that gives a precise orientation - and even enables the bat to know if it is upside down or upright. Similarly, in humans, pilots are trained to guard against a sudden loss of vertical direction - vertigo - that renders them unable to tell 'up' from 'down' and sometimes even leads to crashes. Coming up out of an underground station can produce similar confusion - for a few moments you are unsure which way to go until regaining your sense of direction. In both cases the disorientation is believed to be caused by a temporary malfunction of the brain's 3D compass. 'In order to start understanding brain mechanisms for 3D orientation, we need to start by identifying the basic building blocks,' Mr Finkelstein added. In humans coming up out of an underground station can produce navigational confusion - for a few moments you are unsure which way to go until regaining your sense of direction (stock image shown). It is thought to be caused by a temporary malfunction of the brain's 3D compass. The researchers described how the brains of bats contain neurons that sense which way the head is pointed to support navigation in 3D space. Much research has been conducted on place and grid cells whose discoverers were awarded the 2014 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine. But until recently head-direction cells have been studied only in 2D settings in rats. The researchers described how the brains of bats contain neurons that sense which way the head is pointed. Shown is an Egyptian fruit bat . So the researchers developed a tracking apparatus that allowed them to video-monitor all the three angles of head rotation - in flight terminology, yaw, pitch and roll - and to observe the movements of freely-behaving Egyptian fruit bats. At the same time the bats' neuronal activity was monitored via implanted micro-electrodes which revealed, in a specific sub-region of the hippocampal formation, cells are tuned to a particular 3D angle of the head. Certain neurons became activated only when the animal's head was pointed at that 3D angle. The study also revealed for the first time how the brain computes a sense of the vertical direction integrating it with the horizontal. In the brain compass these directions are computed separately at different levels of complexity - some operating in 2D and others in 3D. The researchers believe the 2D head-direction cells could serve for locomotion along surfaces - as happens in humans when driving a car - whereas the 3D cells could be important for complex manoeuvres in space such as climbing trees or piloting an aircraft. They said: 'Here we present the first evidence to our knowledge for a conjunctive representation of 3D head direction in the mammalian brain which may serve as a ""3D neural compass.""' They say their findings should also apply to non-flying mammals including squirrels and monkeys that jump between trees - as well as humans. Professor Britt Moser - one of the 2014 Nobel laureates - said: 'Now this blueprint can be applied to other species that experience 3D in a more limited sense.'","A study by the Weizmann Institute of Science in Israel has claimed that humans may have an in-built navigation system .

"During it's seven-year run, critics praised 30 Rock as a show on the cutting edge of comedy. Now it appears the Emmy Award-winning show was also ahead of its time when it came to the news - airing a dark joke painting Bill Cosby as a rapist all the way back in 2009. In a clip from season three 'The Bubble', recently unearthed by Crushable, Alec Baldwin's NBC executive character Jack Donaghy tries to get actor Tracy Jordan (played by Tracy Morgan)  to come back to work at fictional television show TGS in the middle of contract negotiations by hiring a Cosby impersonator to speak to the actor over the phone. But the plan backfires when Jordan hears Cosby's voice, and reveals he has some bad family history with the The Cosby Show star. Scroll down for video and transcript . Prediction? In 2009, 30 Rock aired a joke alluding to the allegations of rape against then-beloved comedian Bill Cosby. The joke involved hiring a Cosby impersonator (right) to coax an actor back to work . Under fire: The comedian used to be known as a moral pillar, an image he crafted through is many years playing an upright dad on The Cosby Show. That's changed now that at least 20 women have come forward to accuse him of rape . 'Bill Cosby, you got a lotta nerve gettin’ on the phone wit’ me after what you did to my Aunt Paulette!' Jordan yells down the line. 'I think you’re confusing me with someone else,' the baffled impersonator replies. '1971. Cincinnati. She was a cocktail waitress with the droopy eye!' Jordan responds. The impersonator finds himself at a lack of words, saying: 'I’m the guy… with the pudding…' 'Don’t try to tell me what to do! Dr. Heathcliffe Huxtable, wit’ yo’ light-a** kids! Jack! Why would you make me talk to this man?' Jordan finishes. Not a Cosby fan: Alec Baldwin's character's plan to get Tracy Jordan (played by Tracy Morgan, right) back to work backfires when Jordan reveals an aunt's traumatizing run-in with Cosby in 1971 . Jack Donaghy: I’ve arranged for one of Tracy’s childhood idols to reach out to him. Tracy Jordan: Hello? Jack Donaghy: Tracy, this is Jack, I have someone here who wants to speak with you. Rick (impersonator): Tracy, this is Bill Cosby… . Liz Lemon: [whispering] Really? This is your strategy? Jack Donaghy: [whispering and smiling] I heard him do this at a party! Rick: …I want you to come back to the TGS for the people who like the jokes and the things. Tracy Jordan: Bill Cosby, you got a lotta nerve gettin’ on the phone wit’ me after what you did to my Aunt Paulette! Rick: I think you’re confusing me with someone else. Tracy Jordan: 1971. Cincinnati. She was a cocktail waitress with the droopy eye! Rick: I’m the guy… with the pudding… . Tracy Jordan: Don’t try to tell me what to do! Dr. Heathcliffe Huxtable, wit’ yo’ light-ass kids! Jack! Why would you make me talk to this man? In 2005, it was a dark joke that most likely went over most viewers' heads. But, it's unlikely the joke was crafted randomly. While accusations against Cosby go all the way back to 2004, it wasn't until this October when comedian Hannibal Buress gave a highly-public rant about the comedian which caused scores of women to go public with their stories, ruining the image Cosby forged as a morally upright dad on his television show. Buress himself spent time as a writer on 30 Rock, though he wasn't working for the show until after 'The Bubble' was written. However, the fact that Buress knew about the allegations, means it was likely known by others in the 30 Rock writing room. Show creator Tina Fey is the only person given a writer's credit for the episode, with Donald Glover (who went on to act on Community and also rap under the name Childish Gambino) and Kay Cannon (Jason Sudeikis' ex-wife) serving as executive story producers. Writer: 30 Rock creator and star Tina Fey is the only person credited with writing the episode. She grew up in Upper Darby, Pennsylvania, not far from Temple University where a school employee first called out Cosby for touching her inappropriately in 2004. Fey pictured above attending an event in California on October 20 . That Fey may have known about the allegations against Cosby is also unsurprising, since she grew up in Upper Darby, Pennsylvania near Temple University. It was at Temple in 2004 that rape allegations against Cosby first became public, when a  former university employee Andrea Constand accused the star of fondling her. The case was ultimately thrown out a little over a year later, since authorities said they didn't have enough evidence to charge Cosby. Instead,  Constand field a civil suit in March of that year, and found 13 other women willing to testify as witnesses showing Cosby's pattern of disturbing behavior. The suit was settled out of court for an undisclosed amount in November 2006. Fey has not commented on the scandal.

"The friend of a New Jersey high school student who allegedly had sexual relations with his English teacher took to the witness stand this week to recount what he knew of the pair's relationship. Jenna Leahey, 33, is facing several charges, including sexual assault and official misconduct, for a series of encounters she allegedly had with a 16-year-old male student. The former English teacher and hockey coach at Parsippany Hills High School has pleaded not guilty and the pre-hearing on Tuesday was to decide what evidence will be admissible for trial. The witness said the alleged victim told him that he and Leahey had touched each others genitals in her classroom, according to NJ.com. Charged: Jenna Leahey, 33, is facing several charges including sexual assault and official misconduct for a relationship she had with a student after helping him through the death of a relative . Official misconduct: The prosecution says the former English teacher and hockey coach had a series of encounters with a student between January and June 2013 . They also 'did other physical things in the classroom', he said. 'He also told me she took him home with her after a volleyball game,' the friend said. The friend said he was told of the alleged relationship while playing video games with the alleged victim. He said the boy 'got really quiet' when the friend guessed he was 'talking to' a teacher. The court was told that 'talking to' in high school meant dating. The former student said the alleged victim showed him 'sort of nude' pictures that Leahey had allegedly sent him on text. The incidents allegedly occurred between January and June in 2013. Parsippany Hills High football coach Dave Albano also testified. Albano said the alleged victim and his friend came and told him about Leahey in June last year after rumors started circulating the school. The alleged victim told Albano he and Leahey had 'kissed', 'made out' and 'were fooling around in the car' after a volleyball game when Leahey drove the boy home. The boy said he hadn't had intercourse with Leahey, according to Albano. Scene: Leahey was a former English teacher and hockey coach at Parsippany Hills High School in New Jersey . The boy admitted to the coach they had exchanged 'dirty' text messages. 'He was scared and nervous,' Albano said of the boy. A second friend of the alleged victim told the court Tuesday that he didn't believe the teen when he said he was having a relationship with Leahey. However after teasing the boy, he gave in and showed the text messages. 'Ms. Leahey was one of the good-looking teachers in school,' the second friend said, according to The Daily Record. 'I'd say ''Oh, I saw you trying to flirt with Ms. Leahey''. 'He denied it at first and then got fed up with me teasing him about it.' Leahey gave police a taped interview that was played Tuesday to the judge, where she admitted to sending texts to the boy but denied anything else happened. She had the confidence to the send explicit texts, which said was 'stupid', but was never able to anything when physically with the boy. She said the teen was abusive with her and would touch her breasts and buttocks and put his hand down her pants. Leahey told authorities he also tried to kiss her several times. 'I never physically touched the kid ever. He is just a kid,' she said in her 2013 interview, The Daily Record reported. 'I do feel responsible I didn't draw that line (with the texts) immediately.' Jenna Leahey has pleaded not guilty and the pre-hearing on Tuesday was to decide what evidence will be admissible for trial . Leahey's attorney is seeking to subpoena what authorities allege are explicit text messages she exchanged with the student. Her attorney, Stephanie Forbes, told NJ.com she plans to file a motion to dismiss the charges. The pair's alleged relationship started after Leahey counseled the young man following his aunt's death from cancer. After that the two began texting in a cell phone game.

"A teenager with terminal cancer who realized her dream of playing college basketball earlier this month has admitted it is unlikely she'll get to play in another game as her condition worsens. Ohio teenager Lauren Hill says her cancerous brain tumor makes each day unpredictable and she hasn't been able to practice as much as she would like - something she says she has just had to accept. 'I'm just worried about spending time with my family right now and trying to get to Thanksgiving,' she said on Tuesday. 'You know, just living in the moment.' Ohio teenager Lauren Hill realized her dream of playing college basketball earlier this month, but has admitted it is unlikely she'll get to play in another game as her condition worsens . Two weeks ago the 19-year-old Mount St. Joseph freshman made the national spotlight when she took to the basketball court during a Division III basketball game in front of more than 10,000 fans. 'It seems like it was just yesterday,' she said in her school's gymnasium, with the final score — Mount St. Joseph 66, Hiram 55 — displayed on the scoreboard (the game was held at Xavier's arena). Since the game, her school has received calls from people around the world who were touched by her courage and inspiration. A Layup4Lauren  challenge has raised money for research into the type of cancer that is set to shorten her life. Hill hopes that research will lead to treatments that give others a better chance of beating the odds. Mount St. Joseph's Lauren Hill catches a pass and prepares to shoot during her first NCAA  college basketball game against Hiram University at Xavier University in Cincinnati on November 2 . Xavier University donated $58,776 on Tuesday, money raised from tickets and merchandise as the school offered its arena for the game. The NCAA allowed the schools to move the game up by two weeks because of Hill's condition. So far, more than $324,000 has been donated for cancer research and treatment — far more than Hill had imagined. 'That's a lot,' Hill said. 'I don't even have a reaction. I'm still in shock. It's kind of like walking through a dream. I mean, it's a good dream.' As the inoperable tumor squeezes her strength and energy, Hill squeezes back, holding to life as tightly as she can. The tumor leaves her right side weak at times and makes her dizzy. She sleeps a lot and has to use a wheelchair sometimes. 'Every day or every hour can be different,' said Lisa Hill, her mom. 'Toward the latter part of the day, you'll see her more in her wheelchair because her legs are weaker so she has a hard time moving.' Lisa Hill said her daughter's spirits fluctuate with her physical struggles. Struggle: The teenager was a standout backetball player and former prom queen in high school, right . 'If her right side isn't working, she gets very frustrated just because her body isn't cooperating,' she said. 'But for the most part, she's Lauren.' Hill had to start shooting with her left hand — her non-dominant one — because the tumor affects the right side of her body more significantly. She shows up for practice several times a week to be with her teammates and will make a few shots if she feels up to it. Asked if it's realistic to think she could play in another game, Lisa Hill said, 'I don't know. I would probably say it's maybe not realistic, but you never know on the day. So if she's got really high spirits and her body's doing what it's supposed to be doing, who knows?' Coach Dan Benjamin and Hill's teammates are taking up the cause as her energy wanes. 'Watching her go through her journey has been very tough, knowing she's getting weaker at times, knowing she needs us even more now,' Benjamin said. 'She's not going to be able to get out as much as she has done in the past, so now I will have to become her voice and her teammates will have to become her voice as well.'

"Lying? Charles Warner began complaining about the effects of the experimental drug before they had been administered for his execution . An Oklahoma inmate executed amid a legal challenge over lethal injection began complaining about the effects on his body before the drugs were administered, prompting some to question whether he may have exaggerated his symptoms to help his fellow death row inmates' case. Charles Warner, who was executed Thursday for the killing of an 11-month-old girl in 1997, said during his last words: 'It feels like acid.' The comment came before any of the lethal drugs were administered and while he was only receiving a saline drip through an intravenous line. While on the gurney, he also said he'd been 'poked' five times. Warner's attorney who witnessed his execution, Madeline Cohen, said since she wasn't able to view the IV insertion, she asked Warner to tell her how many times the execution team tried to insert the line and whether he was experiencing any problems. Cohen said she and Warner's family members found Warner's comments 'disturbing' and 'confusing.' Warner was the first person put to death in Oklahoma since a botched execution in April that left Curt Lockett gasping for air and writhing in pain for 43 minutes. The procedure drew national attention to the drugs used in lethal injections. On Thursday, after the first drug, a sedative, was administered, Warner again complained: 'My body is on fire.' Cohen said she doesn't believe Warner would have exaggerated symptoms of suffering, and that defense lawyers would never coach death row inmates about what to say during their last words. She agreed with other witnesses who said Warner showed no other physical signs of distress, such as moaning, writhing or lifting against the restraints, but she said there's really no way to tell if he was suffering . Scroll down for video . Controversy: Jerry Massie, spokesman for the Oklahoma Department of Corrections, announces the time of death of inmate Charles Warner to the media at the Oklahoma State Penitentiary in McAlester, Okla . 'I just don't know. We have tried to get transparency about what they're doing and to be able to observe (the IV insertion),' Cohen said of prison officials. 'And we've been denied that. So between the actual veiling and the chemical veiling, it's very hard for us to know what's going on.' But some criminal prosecutors suggested death row inmates would be quick to exaggerate the symptoms of an execution, especially if doing so would be helpful to fellow death row inmates. 'I think what you witnessed is predictable, especially if it could be helpful to the guys behind him,' said Rex Duncan, a northern Oklahoma prosecutor who recently protested a death row inmate's request for clemency. Randy Lopez, a retired prison guard who spent his entire career at the Oklahoma State Penitentiary, said there is a brotherhood among death row inmates and that he thinks Warner was 'hamming it up.' 'He did it for the other inmates,' Lopez said. Neither Duncan nor Lopez witnessed Warner's execution. Warner and other death row inmates were plaintiffs in a lawsuit challenging Oklahoma's method of execution as cruel and unusual. They claimed the first drug, midazolam, won't properly anesthetize an inmate before the second and third drugs are administered. Although the U.S. Supreme Court rejected Warner's request for a stay of execution in a narrow 5-4 ruling on Thursday, the inmates' request for the high court to consider the merit of their challenge still is pending, according to Dale Baich, an attorney for the inmates. Writing the dissent, Justice Sonia Sotomayor said she believes questions about the effectiveness of drugs used in executions is particularly important now because of states' increasing reliance on new and scientifically untested methods of execution.

"It's so big that it has to be supported on two tripods and fires ammunition that's three times the size of standard rifle ammo. An Isis terrorist has been photographed aiming a 10-foot long sniper rifle out of a flat window in Kobane. The fearsome weapon fires 23mm calibre bullets, far larger than the standard size. Fearsome: An Isis terrorist has been photographed aiming a 10-foot long sniper rifle out of a flat window in Kobane . Gigantic: This picture shows a row of 23mm bullets - the same size as those fired by the 10-foot rifle . Huge casings from the bullets can be seen on the floor next to the gunman. What sort of effect this gun would have remains open to debate, however, according to firearms expert David Dyson. He told MailOnline: 'The problem with identifying the effect of this gun is firstly that we don't know for sure what the calibre is, although there wouldn't be a lot of point in building something like this if it wasn't of a significant calibre. Secondly, and probably of more importance, we don't know how well it is made: is the barrel accurately machined and rifled? 'The effect will also depend on the type of ammunition used. These rounds exist [23mm] fitted with high explosive incendiary or armour piercing incendiary projectiles.They will be effective against personnel and vehicles including lightly armoured ones.' The picture emerged after a show of force from al Qaeda's Nusra Front, a rival group. They toured in a convoy around villages they said they had captured from Syrian rebels. Dozens of pick-up trucks bristling with anti-aircraft guns and men armed with heavy machine guns drove through settlements in the southern countryside of Idlib.

Isis was formed by a merger of the Nusra Front and Al Qaeda in Iraq in 2013, but many in the former group rejected the move. By March 2014 over 3,000 fighters had been killed in clashes between the two sides. Meanwhile, video journalist Jake Simkin has offered a rare glimpse inside Kobane's last remaining field hospital. Most of Kobane's hospitals and clinics now lie in ruins. Only one is still working - but its location is kept secret for fear it could be targeted by the militants. Inside the tiny field clinic, saving lives and dealing with horrifying wounds of war comes first, and concerns such as keeping operating rooms sterile and cleaning up after surgery are on the back burner. Dr. Mohammed Arif helps to deal with a wounded patient at a field hospital in Kobane .

Pictured is the aftermath of a truck bomb . This  photo clearly shows the devastation wrought on Kobane by the war with Isis . Helped by more than 270 airstrikes from a U.S.-led coalition and an American airdrop of weapons, the fighters in Kobane (pictured) have succeeded in halting the militants' advance . Blood is splattered across most of the beds and floors, and a small team of only three doctors and five nurses are providing the only remaining medical services in the town. They are sometimes forced to operate by torchlight since power generators regularly fail. They treat a seemingly unending flood of wounded Kurdish fighters and members of the Free Syrian Army, just meters (yards) away from the front lines. The Spartan clinic only has the very basic equipment and regularly runs out of supplies. Those with more critical wounds must make a mad dash for the border with Turkey, and wait there for a transport to a better hospital in the neighboring country. But losing precious time in the perilous journey often diminishes their chances for survival. 'If we had a mobile operating unit, we wouldn't have to leave our wounded at the Turkish border to wait for six or 10 hours where they sometimes die,' said Mohammed Aref, a doctor at the Kobane clinic. Simkin's reports have revealed just how destructive the battle for Kobane has been. The Kurdish fighters of Kobane, backed by a small number of Iraqi peshmerga forces and Syrian rebels, are locked in what they say is a fight to the end against the Islamic State group, which swept into the town in mid-September. The militants' advance was part of a summer blitz after the Islamic State group overran large parts of Syria and neighboring Iraq. Kobane, which once had a population of about 50,000, has seen some of the fiercest urban warfare in Syria's civil war, now in its fourth year, and has paid a heavy price for battling the Islamic State extremists. Aref and the others at the Kobane clinic say the immobility of their facility slows them down, since they cannot venture far outside and treat the wounded at the scene - as paramedics and mobile doctors elsewhere do in combat situations. The Kurds' defence of Kobane (pictured) has been aided by Coalition air strikes . Still, Aref is dedicated to saving Kobane's wounded as best he can and dreams of someday rebuilding the town clinics and working in a safe operating theater. Helped by more than 270 airstrikes from a U.S.-led coalition and an American airdrop of weapons, the fighters in Kobane have succeeded in halting the militants' advance and believe that a corner has been turned. But the fight against the Islamic State is not slowing down. 'We know that the number (of wounded) will increase and more injured will come so we have to be ready,' said Aref. 'The most important thing for us is having an operating room.' In a previous report Simkin spoke to a teenage girl who's fighting Isis in Kobane with her father. Pervin Kobani is part of a team holding an eastern front-line position that comes under regular attack from the extremist fighters. Three weeks ago, Pervin bumped into her father on a street corner. She was surprised to see him holding a gun. She didn't know that he too had decided to fight. Her mother is a refugee in Turkey, her only brother studying in Algeria. 'Honestly when I heard my father is fighting on the western front with the YPG I was so proud of him, and it made me want to fight more,' she said. Determined: Pervin is part of a team holding an eastern front-line position that comes under regular attack from the extremist fighters . Fighting family: Pervin Kobani (right), who's fighting Isis in Kobane, hugs her father, who's doing the same . Her father, Farouk Kobane, joined the town's defenders in mid-September, when IS, also known as Isis, launched their attack. He was delighted to see his daughter that day three weeks ago, after months without news. Last week, Simkin traveled with Pervin to the western front, to see her father once again. She says he is now her comrade first - but she hugs him like a father anyway.","Isis terrorist photographed aiming a 10-foot rifle out of a window .

"England were celebrating an unlikely victory deep in the Sri Lankan jungle  – but for Alastair Cook it may have come at a price. While the tourists were rejoicing in a desperately needed win that closes the deficit to 2-1 and breathes life into a side that had been inviting ridicule, their captain was waiting to hear if he would face a one-match ban for England’s slow over-rate. As Sri Lanka ran up 242 for eight in a game shortened by a biblical downpour to 35 overs a side, Cook’s team were 18 minutes off the pace. Fined for the same offence against India at Cardiff in August, he could now be banned for Sunday’s crucial game in Colombo. Jos Buttler (left) and Joe Root shake hands after their unbroken 84-run partnership helped England to victory . Root clenches his fist in celebration after the much-needed victory in the third ODI against Sri Lanka . Root is congratulated by Alastair Cook after helping to see England to victory over Sri Lanka . The injured Stuart Broad tweeted his delight after the England win . ‘We’ll plead our case,’ he said. ‘It was tough on that big ground with the ball going everywhere at the end, and it takes a long time for batsmen to come out to the middle.’ ICC match referee David Boon may take a different view. And if Cook is banned for a game, it will raise the question of whether the captaincy passes to Eoin Morgan, who continued his wretched run here by falling on the hook for a single. Right now, he hardly looks in the frame of mind to score meaningful runs, let alone lead his country. England’s get-out clause may be that there is no official vice-captain on this tour, in which case Joe Root could come into the picture. That, though, is a bridge England will cross at some point over the next few days. For now, they can simply enjoy reacquainting themselves with the unfamiliar scent of victory – only their second in nine completed matches. Cook himself produced another innings that was neither one thing nor the other, and his 42-ball 34 ended with a tame drive to the keeper. But England will be quietly thrilled at yet another glittering knock from Moeen Ali, and with the composure shown by Root and Jos Buttler after a brief wobble. As Cook put it: ‘A side full of confidence would have done it easier than we did.’ Having raced to 50 in 21 balls during the first warm-up game, Ali got there in 25 in the first one-day international, and 29 here. If he’s slowing down, he’s doing it in style: his innings here included five effortless sixes. It helped that the boundaries at Mahinda Rajapaksa International Stadium had been brought in, but this was still carefree batting of the highest order. ‘The Beard That’s Feared’ has made the transition from a marketing gimmick at Worcestershire to a statement of fact at the highest level. England being England, they almost made a mess of it. After Cook and his opening partner had put on 84 inside 12 overs, Alex Hales – finally given a chance at the expense of Ian Bell – was culpable in the run-out of Ali.

Hales was then caught tamely at mid-on after a promising 27 in 29 balls, before Ravi Bopara – promoted to No 5 – and Morgan both fell cheaply to leave England 152 for five. Root was caught off a Prasad no-ball on 40, but the eventual ease of England’s triumph – completed with eight deliveries to spare, with Buttler rediscovering his touch in an unbeaten 55 from 37 balls – will persuade them they can still get something out of this seven-match series. Sri Lanka’s innings had been rebuilt from 31 for three by a run-a-ball stand of 87 between two of the world game’s in-form batsmen, Kumar Sangakkara and Angelo Mathews, before both fell to the recalled Chris Jordan.

Sangakkara became the fourth player to pass 13,000 one-day runs on his way to a typically classy 63 off 62 balls, before Lahiru Thirimanne and tailender Dhammika Prasad helped crash 62 off the last five overs. Chris Woakes picked up three wickets, but Bopara was again underbowled – sending down only three overs – and Ben Stokes looked worryingly devoid of rhythm and confidence. His two overs cost 28; so far in the series, he has sent down six wicketless overs for 64. Stokes played here instead of James Tredwell. It’s hard to imagine the off-spinner not returning in Colombo. England will head to the capital with an unexpected spring in their step. Sangakkara and the Sri Lankans celebrate after running out Moeen .

"Once upon a time, Arsenal played Chelsea and, more often than not, beat them. But that was before the Roman empire swept into Stamford Bridge and altered the Premier League landscape. Instead of the fixture that Gunners fans looked forward to the most, it has become the match they must secretly dread. It was another Bridge – Wayne – who landed the first blow on behalf of owner Roman Abramovich and announced the arrival of a new order when he grabbed an 87th minute winner to clinch a 3-2 aggregate Champions League win at Highbury in March 2004. Wayne Bridge scores against Arsenal for Chelsea at Highbury in the Champions League back in March 2004 . The arrival of Jose Mourinho and Roman Abramovich marked an end to Arsenal's victories over Chelsea . Things have never been quite the same, since. And Bridge’s goal was the turning point. Emirates supporters look away now, as a reminder of the good old days brings home how fortunes have changed in the Premier League era. Post Roman, the teams have played 28 times. Arsenal have won just six matches in all competitions, drawn seven and lost 15. Contrast and compare that with 1992-2003, before the Russian billionaire turned Chelsea from fancy dans to title winners. The teams faced each other 22 times. Arsenal lost only three, won 12 and drew seven and were the undisputed kings of the capital. Arsenal players look dejected as Chelsea celebrate their 6-0 victory in March of this year . It all looked so rosy, in February 2004, when Arsene Wenger’s team knocked Chelsea out of the FA Cup and then beat them 2-1 at Stamford Bridge in what was then known as the Premiership. Prick Vieira and Edu cancelled out Eidur Gudjohnsen’s early strike while the Icelander was also sent off in the second half. One month later the rivals met in the Champions League. The first leg was drawn 1-1 and Arsenal were over-riding favourites. Jose Reyes gave the Gunners the lead on half-time only for Frank Lampard to level the scores before Bridge had the final say. Arsenal fans could argue that it was not in the Premier League, which is what really counts over a season. The same could be applied to the Community Shield in 2005 when a Didier Drogba double ensured a 2-1 Chelsea win. Kieran Gibbs is mistakenly sent off following Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain's handball on the goal-line . But later that August, Arsenal could no longer claim to be so superior as Drogba scored the only goal in a 1-0 Premier League home victory. The return was in December the same year. Arjen Robben and Joe Cole both found the net at Highbury and Chelsea had done the double over their North London neighbours. As far as the neutral is concerned, however, this is a match which tends to throw up lots of goals, plenty of controversy and the enduring feud between Arsene Wenger and Jose Mourinho. Arsenal fans will not need long memories to recall a rare fine moment – the 5-3 extravaganza in October 2011 when Robin van Persie scored twice in the last five minutes to complete his hat-trick after it looked as if Juan Mata had clinched a 3-3 draw. Then again, they will not want reminding about what happened last season. Down to ten men (even if Kieran Gibbs was sent off instead of Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain) and on the end of a 6-0 thrashing. Will the tide turn again on Sunday? The bookies suggest not.","Chelsea host Arsenal in the Premier League on Sunday .

"Recently, scientists have postulated that the most abundant stars in our galaxy, red dwarfs, despite being no more than 20 per cent the mass of the sun, might be able to host habitable planets. But a new study has warned that any 'Earth-like' worlds we spot in the habitable zone of these stars will be nothing more than an illusion – owing to the intense radiation they receive early in their life. The study claims that so-called 'mirage Earths' will look like our own planet from afar, but peering deeper into the planet will reveal it to be a barren world with no water, or life, on its surface. University of Washington researchers have claimed that planets around red dwarfs (illustrated) cannot be habitable. It was thought planets around the dim stars could host water and life. But new research says such Earth-like planets are not possible. This is because the stars are more active early on while the planets form . The research was carried out by astronomy graduate student Rodrigo Luger and assistant professor Rory Barnes at the University of Washington. They studied red dwarfs, also known as M stars, which make up about 75 per cent of stars in our galaxy. In their study the researchers found that, early in their life, M dwarfs were much more active. This is the same for most stars, but M dwarfs take longer because they are so much smaller. Last year a study suggested that Earth-like planets may be able to support life in a small area of their surface even if most of their water is permanently frozen. Planets that orbit red dwarf stars, known as exoplanets, can become 'tidally locked' so that their water is frozen on their permanently cold night-time sides but they could still sustain life, astronomer Kristen Menou at Columbia University said. Just as our moon is tidally locked to the Earth, only showing us one hemisphere, the same could be true of these exoplanets facing red dwarfs. As a result, the planets have a permanent day side and permanent night side. This leaves only a thin band of water around the planet where the temperature was just right for it to remain liquid, and this is where organisms could grow. This means that once planets have formed, roughly 10 million years after the star's formation, they will be subjected to the full brunt of the star's early activity until it quietens down. Any water present on the planets would therefore be boiled by this intense heat from the sun. And in a cruel trick on Earth-based astronomers this water would be split into hydrogen and oxygen atoms. The release of the latter would produce huge atmospheres full of oxygen that, from afar, would make the planet look habitable. But journeying to the surface of the planet would reveal the reality of a dried up world that lost its water long ago - earning the moniker mirage Earths. 'Because of the oxygen they build up, they could look a lot like Earth from afar - but if you look more closely you'll find that they're really a mirage; there's just no water there,' said Mr Luger. He added that 'many of the planets in the habitable zones of M dwarfs could have been dried up by this process early on, severely decreasing their chance of actually being habitable.' The researchers say these atmospheres could be 10 times denser than that of Venus and could 'confound our search for life on exoplanets.' The research suggests that red dwarf stars do not quieten down before the planets form and boil water away. This leaves a thick atmosphere of oxygen that looks livable, tricking astronomers into thinking they are habitable. But examining the planet up close would reveal no water on its surface (illustration shown) M dwarf stars, which include red dwarfs, are the most abundant star in our galaxy, making up three out of every four stars. However they are only about 20 per cent as massive as the sun, and thus have much smaller habitable zones (illustration shown) than other types of star . A few years ago it was thought that such stars, just a fifth as massive as the sun, were too weak to be able to host habitable planets. But more recently scientists had begun to postulate that they might be able to cling onto tight habitable zones, where temperatures are just right for water to form on a planet. Considering they are by far the most abundant star in the galaxy, discovering they could have habitable planets in orbit is important in the hunt for Earth-like worlds, and life, beyond the solar system. It will be a major disappointment then if this new research, which threatens to pour water on that hopeful theory, proves to be true. 'All stars form in the collapse of a giant cloud of interstellar gas, which releases energy in the form of light as it shrinks,' Mr Luger said. 'But because of their lower masses, and therefore lower gravities, M dwarfs take longer to fully collapse - on the order of many hundreds of millions of years.' He added: 'Planets around these stars can form within 10 million years, so they are around when the stars are still extremely bright. 'And that's not good for habitability, since these planets are going to initially be very hot, with surface temperatures in excess of a thousand degrees. When this happens, your oceans boil and your entire atmosphere becomes steam.' A few years ago it was thought that red dwarf stars (illustrated), just a fifth as massive as the sun, were too weak to be able to host habitable planets. But more recently scientists had begun to postulate that they might be able to cling onto tight habitable zones, where temperatures are just right for water to form on a planet .","University of Washington study says red dwarf planets are not habitable .

"The Duchess of Cornwall couldn't resist taking home a 'swag bag' made by burly prisoners - who have, remarkably, been taught the gentile art of needlework. Camilla was browsing a pop up store at London's historic Fortnum and Mason in support of the lags' charity, Fine Cell Work, today. Long one of the royal's favourite organisations, it trains prisoners to sew and pays them up to £500 per year for the products they produce, including exquisitely-made cushions, bags, tea cosies, quilts, and Christmas decorations. Sense of humour: The Duchess laughs as she holds up her swag bag purchase . The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge are among those who have already received gifts made by Fine Cell Work prisoners, 97 per cent of whom are men and can be Category A and B inmates, among the most dangerous in the country. Prince Charles and Camilla have also bought regularly from the charity since its prisoners made them a wedding gift - a needlework duck and badger - for their 2005 wedding. One inmate at Wandsworth Prison took so much pride in making the royal gift he was nicknamed the Earl of Wandsworth by cell mates. The prisoners also supply top design firms like Colefax and Fower, Stella McCartney, Conran and Ben Pentreath, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge's interior designer. Camilla immediately spotted a humorous bag stitched with SWAG which cost £39, a dachshund cushion for £150 and a couple of £10 pin cushions, which she paid for herself. She admitted that her own sewing skills were hopeless but praised the charity for the quality of its work. Who should I give this to? The royals are known for exchanging quirky gifts at Christmas . Keen eye for detail: The Duchess admired the skill that had gone into making the products which were created by offenders who are trained and supported by volunteers from the Embroiderers and Quilters Guild . Which should I buy? The Duchess was spoilt for choice . Ta dah! Camilla unveiled a framed picture commemorating the opening of the pop-up shop . After the visit the Duchess had a quick snoop round the Piccadilly department store - founded in 1707 - browsing for other Christmas gifts. Louisa Macfarlane, a volunteer from Hampshire, has worked with prisoners at Albany on the Isle of Wight for the past 12 years. 'We've got all the best ones,' she said fondly. 'It's a Who's Who of 20th century villainy.' She spoke movingly of how teaching prisoners to stitch had changed their lives and given them something to take pride in, although she declined to name any of the more notorious prisoners she has worked with in those years. Asked whether she ever felt in danger, she laughed: 'No, I have two boys of my own.' She added: 'I see so many tragic stories, people whose lives could gone in any one of a number of directions but have never received the help and support they need. Charity venture: The goods made by Fine Cell Work will be on sale at Fortnum & Mason . Stocking up: Dog lover Camilla also bought a Dachshund decorated cushion . Handiwork: Camilla was amused and impressed by the swag bag, created by prisoners who stitch independently in their cells or take part in workshops . Workshop: Camilla watched demonstrations of some of the techniques taught to prisoners. 'We sit around the Ping Pong table or television room and sew together. It's quite remarkable when you see it. Like a little sewing bee.' At any one time, the charity, which pays 37 per cent of the proceeds from its sales to the prisoners, works with 240 inmates around the country. They spend an average 28 hours per week working on making the goods. If they earn more than £500 in a year, it is kept for them until their release so that the savings can help them stay crime-free. Some have even gone on to work in interior and costume design on being released. Camilla, loading up her shopping bag, confessed that needlework had never exactly been her strong point at school and there had been little improvement since. 'Don't get me started on that,' she joked. Katye Emck, founding director of the charity, said they make a point of not discussing their prisoners' crimes. 'Sewing transcends that and we pass no judgement,' she said. 'What we do shows these men the virtue of work, how to take pride in what they do and give them a small income. Stitching is also remarkably emotionally therapeutic.' Lively chat: Camilla meets volunteers and supporters of the Fine Cell Work pop-up shop .

"An honest assistant manager of a Burger King  found an abandoned backpack stuffed with cash while cleaning tables late last month and rather than keep it, notified her manager. Sahista Bakawla waited for the bag's owner to come back to the San Jose, California, outlet of the fast food chain and claim it. Strangely no-one did, so she took it to franchise owner Altaf Chaus who opened the bag to look for ID. The contents of the bag surprised them both: $100,000 in cash along with a baggie of marijuana and a suspicious 'white rock'. Scroll down for video . Sahista Bakawla (left), who found the backpack while cleaning, and Altaf Chaus, owner of the San Jose Burger King, who has said he will donate the proceeds to charity should the cash come to him . Bakawla told KGO Bay Area: ‘I twice cleaned, like two or three times cleaned the tables, and it's still here. I waited until 3pm. And nobody came here.’ Said Chaus: 'I open the zipper, I see lots of money, cash money, $100 bills stack up like half the bag. I said, ""Wow! Today's my birthday, this is my birthday gift."".' He immediately called the police. ‘I've been in this country 26 years and I worked two jobs for 15 years before I bought this Burger King. So I'm a very hard working man. I don't want that money, maybe it belongs to somebody.’ When police inspected the backpack, they found ten stacks of $10,000 totaling $100,000,  candy, cigarettes,  a bank withdrawal slip, and a bag of marijuana and a 'white rock' in it, that possibly could have been drugs, Chaus told NBC. The restaurant was busy that afternoon and San Jose Police Sergeant Heather Randol said there were not many leads related to the owner's identity. Police were working with local bank officials to locate the individual who left the money behind. For now the cash has been booked into a property warehouse. Stacks of bills totaling $100,000 was found along with a small amount of marijuana and a deposit slip . Officers told Chaus that by law the money was his if nobody claimed it in a six-month period. Given the amount of cash, there is speculation it was intended for a morally dubious transaction and may therefore go unclaimed. If the money does come to him, Chaus told UPI that he would ‘donate the money to needy people’. Speaking to the San Jose Mercury News, he said one possibility was a Muslim foundation that he allows to leave fundraising material on his counter. Chaus is a Muslim himself, and originally came to the U.S. from India. Only two weeks earlier, the branch had mistakenly accepted counterfeit $100 bills, and Chaus put up a handwritten sign on the milk shake machine by the cash register saying NO $100 BILLS PLEASE. Asked if anyone has ever left a large amount of cash behind before, Chaus recalled: ‘One time a lady left her wallet with $800 in it.’ On that occasion he found her ATM card, called the bank, and she got her money back.

"The fiancé of a young woman whose life was cut short as she waited for a double lung transplant is urging people to join the donor register and give others 'a second chance at life'. Kerry Thorpe died in March aged just 23 after a life-long battle with cystic fibrosis. Miss Thorpe had been on the transplant list for almost two years but succumbed to the disease before a match was found. Since her death her partner of five years, Josh Nelli has been raising awareness of the disease, which causes the lungs to become clogged with mucus. Scroll down for video . Josh Nelli, whose fiancee Kerry Thorpe, died from cystic fibrosis in . March, is today urging people to sign the Organ Donation Register after . Miss Thorpe lost her battle before new lungs were found for her . Miss Thorpe was just 23 when she succumbed to the disease, which she had fought since the age of six months . Mr Nelli, of Kesgrave, Suffolk, registered as an organ donor days after meeting Miss Thorpe, and now he’s urging others to do the same. His call comes as data from NHS Blood and Transplant revealed that despite a 10 per cent rise on the number of transplants carried out in 2013-14 on the year prior, the shortage of donors means three people a day still die waiting for their call. 'My message is simple,' he told MailOnline. 'If people register as an organ donor they are registering to one day save someone’s life. 'Kerry wanted a second chance at life, but sadly she never got it. 'I don’t want others going through what we have, because it could be so easily solved through having more organ donors. 'If more people realised the lives they could save by doing this – surely they wouldn’t think twice, so many people could be given the second chance that Kerry never had. 'Kerry didn’t want much, it was the simple things such as being able to breathe without being in pain and being able to walk her dogs – that’s all she wanted.' Miss Thorpe was diagnosed with CF when she was just six-months-old. But at the age of 20 doctors told her, that a double lung transplant was her only hope, giving her just 18 months to live. At the age of 20 doctors told Miss Thorpe her only hope would be a double lung transplant. They gave her 18 months to live. She fought for three years, but died before a donor was found. Miss Thorpe is pictured at Papworth Hospital with Mr Nelli and her family, shortly before she died . 'My message is simple,' Mr Nelli told MailOnline. 'If people register as an organ donor they are registering to one day save someone's life. Kerry wanted a second chance at life, but sadly never got it' Miss Thorpe inspired countless people to sign the Organ Donation Register as she fought to survive long enough for her donor to be found. She fronted a national campaign for the charity, the CF Trust, Live Life Then Give Life . Despite her drive to help others, time ran out for Kerry . She outlived their predictions, but her life became an endless cycle of hospital visits and medication. But the selfless 23-year-old dedicated the time she had left to helping others. As she fought for her own life, she urged countless people to sign up to become organ donors, fronting a national campaign, Live Life Then Give Life. With the support of Miss Thorpe’s family, Mr Nelli has set up a charity in her honour – the Kerry Alex Thorpe Trust – aiming to raise awareness for organ donation and CF and help support the children in Suffolk battling the life shortening disease. So far more than £6,500 has been raised since Miss Thorpe lost her fight. The charity is now working with Ipswich Hospital, where Miss Thorpe received treatment as a child before turning 16 when her care was transferred to the adult CF centre at Papworth Hospital in Cambridgeshire. 'Kerry had great memories of her time at Ipswich Hospital and we’re looking to hold wish days for the children there who are suffering from CF,' Mr Nelli said. 'We also want to support the hospital’s classroom by buying any toys or educational goods they need.' The NHS wants to increase the donor rate by more than 50 per cent by 2020, and while Mr Nelli says he’d like to think it would be an easy task he has to remain 'realistic'. 'Hopefully people understand the situation we've been in and we can get them thinking about organ donations,' he said. 'You don't need them when you’re dead and while it would be amazing to think everyone is going to instantly join the register it's an unrealistic wish. Mr Nelli has set up The Kerry Thorpe Trust, in memory of his partner of five years. He is raising money to help children battling the illness at Ipswich Hospital, where Kerry first received treatment . 'We can all make a difference in someone else's life and that's an amazing thing to be able to do. 'The more people on the donor register, the less time people have to wait for their transplant and the more likely they are to have a good recovery post transplant. 'Kerry would have been in a much better situation having a transplant three months after being put on the list compared to having one 18 months after being put on the list because obviously health can deteriorate when you're that unwell.' Wales is trialling an opt-out system for organ donation in 2015, which Mr Nelli describes as 'a massive step in the right direction'. He hopes it will eventually be rolled out UK-wide. He added: 'If you’re not a donor, ask yourself why not and at least consider it because the impact you will having is massive. What better gift to others than the second chance at life? 'I'll miss Kerry every day but the trust is my way of making sure her legacy goes on.' To find out more about The Kerry Alex Thorpe Trust visit the website here.

Symptoms usually appear in early childhood and they include a persistent cough, recurring chest infections and failure to thrive. As the condition develops, a lung transplant may be required. There is no cure for cystic fibrosis so treatment revolves around relieving symptoms and reducing long-term damage caused by infections. The most common treatments are physiotherapy to clear the mucus from the lungs, and antibiotics to treat infections. The condition is caused by a genetic mutation which allows too much salt and water into cells - this results in a build-up of mucus. For a child to inherit the condition, both of their parents have to be carriers of the mutated gene. In this situation, there is a one in four chance the child will not inherit either of the faulty genes, a one in two chance they will inherit one of them and be a carrier but not a sufferer, and a one in four chance they will inherit both genes and suffer from the condition. About one in every 2,500 babies born in the UK are born with cystic fibrosis. As treatments have improved, the outlook for these children has improved dramatically. Life expectancy remains in the 40s. Source: NHS Choices .","Kerry Thorpe, from Kesgrave in Suffolk, died in March at the age of 23 .
