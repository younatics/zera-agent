"She has been known as 'the other girl' or even the 'lucky one' but four years after being attacked with a baseball bat in Chicago, Stacy Jurich still bears emotional scars. In April 2010 she had her friend Natasha McShane had been walking home after a night out when a man savagely beat them as they passed under a viaduct. Miss Jurich needed more than 15 stitches in the back of her head, lost some of her vision and suffers from tremors. Her 23-year-old friend, Miss McShane, was left unable to walk or talk. Survivor: Stacy Jurich stands at the entrance to the viaduct where she and her friend Natasha McShane were brutally attacked in 2010 . Victim: Northern Irish graduate Natasha McShane was left seriously disabled after the attack . Their attacker stole the girls' purses and Miss Jurich remembers thinking that no one would know who they were, just before she lost consciousness. Miss Jurich told the Chicago Tribune that it was while she was still in hospital that she realized she was the only one who could help bring their attacked to justice. A few days after the attack, detectives visited her in hospital and asked her to identify items they had found. It was perfume and make up the friends had bought the day before the attack. The sight of their belongings reduced Miss Jurich to tears, but she told the Chicago Tribune it made her think: 'This is on your plate now. You are the only voice.' For the . past four years Ms Jurich has worked tirelessly with police to ensure . their attacker, Heriberto Viramontes, would be brought to justice. He . is due to be sentenced next week, after being found guilt in October of . attempted murder, armed robbery and aggravated robber. Painful memories: Stacy stands close to where she and Natasha were attacked. Four years after their ordeal she can still recall seeing her friend being smashed to the ground . Brave: Stacy Jurich, center, leaves a courtroom during her attacker's trial last year . Guilty: Heriberto Viramontes was convicted of attempted murder last year. Marcy Cruz, right, was also jailed for 22 years for driving Viramontes away after he attacked and robbed two young women . Marcy Cruz, who drove him away from the crime scene, has already been sentenced to 22 years in prison. When she faced Viramontes at the trial last year, Miss Jurich, 28, told the court: I had to be the voice because I didn't want this man to hurt anyone else. I wanted to put [Viramontes] away for my best friend, for Natasha.' With an end to the trial in sight, Miss Jurich is starting to feel strong enough to talk about her ordeal. The granddaughter of a police sergeant, who lives in Chicago with her fiance Tim Shannon, is still reduced to tears when she thinks about the attack and its aftermath. She kept cuttings of news articles about her and her friend, and has an assortment of gifts sent by the city's Irish community while she was recovering. But she has only returned twice to the crime scene, where their attacker had rushed up behind the girls at about 3am, striking Miss Jurich before smashing Miss McShane to the ground. Her most recent visit was during an interview with the Chicago Tribune, as she gave a rare interview about the impact the attack had on her life. For the past four years, she told the . paper, she had been known as 'the other girl,' because Miss McShane's . injuries had been so physically devastating. High profile: The attack that left Natasha, pictured, disabled was used to highlight the increased violence in Chicago . But Miss Jurich was also seriously injured, and left unable to work after the attack. She has lost part of her vision and suffered seizures. 'When you look at her from the outside, people might think she's fine, that she is this beautiful young girl. But she still has seizures. She has trouble with peripheral vision. She still has nightmares,' her aunt, Tammy Alfaro, told the Tribune. 'That stuff never went away for her,' she added. Miss Jurich, 28, can vividly recall seeing her friend, a Northern Irish graduate who had been studying in the city, crashing to the ground as Viramontes hit her. 'She went . down immediately. She just lifelessly fell into the sidewalk,' Ms Jurich . told a court at their attacker's trial last year. The . pair had been having a 'fantastic evening' Miss Jurich said. But the . attack changed both of their lives, and left Miss McShane needing . round-the-clock care. Miss Jurich told the Tribune that when she finally regained consciousness in hospital two days after their attack, she couldn't shake the horror she had seen. 'I said, ""No, no, no"" because I still remembered. I saw her on that ground. I saw her, and there was blood everywhere. It wasn't just my blood. I said, ""Where is she?"". Healing: Four years after the attack Stacy, pictured with her fiance Tim Shannon, is getting her life back on track . Life changing: The events of that April night in 2010 have shaped Stacy and Natasha's life forever . On the night she was left disabled for life, Miss McShane had just been offered an internship that would have allowed her to extend her visa in the U.S. Instead, her family flew her back to Northern Ireland, where she struggles to accomplish even the smallest of tasks, like drinking from a cup. Miss Jurich says she is haunted by feelings of guilt. When she got engaged, and got a job she felt sad knowing her friend would never share those experiences. To pay tribute to her friend, and as a reminder of the attack that changed both of their lives forever, Miss Jurich designed a tattoo, featuring two roses to represent the friends, and an Irish cross to represent Miss McShane's home country. Miss Jurich still Skypes Miss McShane and says she would like to visit her. 'I just want to just see her, and to let her know that I didn't give up the fight,' she said.","Stacy Jurich still bears emotional scars from mugging four years ago .

"Ricky Alvarez celebrated his move to the Premier League by meeting Pope Francis – but is he the answer to Sunderland’s creative prayers? The Inter Milan playmaker completed a season-long loan switch to the Stadium of Light on deadline day, with a view to making the deal permanent for £8.5millon next summer. But what will the 26-year-old bring to Wearside? Sportsmail takes a closer look… . Inter Milan to Sunderland… Why? Inter are going through a rebuilding process after a couple of disappointing seasons and Alvarez, despite appearing 29 times in Serie A last year, was one player coach Walter Mazzarri was willing to let go in a bid to manoeuvre his squad. Gus Poyet was alerted and Sunderland moved quickly to get the deal in place last week. Divine inspiration: lvarez celebrates scoring for Inter Milan and will be hoping to score plenty for Sunderland . Physical presence: Ricky Alvarez is 6ft 2in but has a proven touch and good vision . So how has he fared at the San Siro? He leaves with 11 goals from 73 appearances over three seasons – which is a fair return on both counts – but there have been periods where he has struggled to impact and his future at the club questioned. He has failed to make one position on the park his own, but at the same time has shown flashes of creative genius, especially when operating in a withdrawn role behind a striker. The frustration for Inter fans was amplified by the reputation with which he arrived and the inability to produce his best on a consistent basis. What about his early days? His move to Europe came after four seasons with Velez Sarsfield, where a cruciate ligament injury had curtailed his early progress. But come the end of his time in Argentina his stock was high and, having just helped Velez to a second league championship, Inter paid £10m for the then 23-year-old. Mixing it with the best: Ricky Alvarez (left) played in Match For Peace on Monday . Catch him if you can: Ricky Alvarez gets away from Atletico Madrid manager Diego Simeone . Proven quality: Ricky Alvarez has seven caps for Argentina and has scored one goal . So what type of player is he? He’s a rangy type – 6ft 2ins – and not particularly pacey either, but it’s his skill and vision on the ball which makes him a full international and persuaded Inter to invest all that money three years ago. His first touch is second nature and he can unlock a defence in an instant. Where will he fit in at Sunderland? Left-footed, Alvarez can cut in from the right flank – but that is a domain already populated by Adam Johnson. His best performances for Inter came in a No.10 role and, to that end, he could well operate in an advanced position of a midfield three alongside Lee Cattermole and Jack Rodwell. So will he prove a success? He’s certainly got a point to prove, inconsistency being his key criticism. But there is ability there and he was part of the Argentina squad which finished runners-up at the World Cup in Brazil. He’s currently on international duty and met Pope Francis this week – and Poyet will be hoping Alvarez repays the faith he has shown in his fellow South American.","Alvarez sealed a loan move to Sunderland on deadline day .

"More details have emerged of Kevin Pietersen’s fractious relationship with senior England players and his attempts to undermine captain Alastair Cook in the early stages of last winter’s disastrous Ashes tour. Pietersen, who was sacked after the tour, for a breakdown in trust with senior management, is expected to blame, among others, former coach Andy Flower along with erstwhile team-mates Andrew Strauss and Matt Prior for his international exile in an autobiography to be released on Monday. The ECB have drawn up a dossier of offences which led to the 34-year-old’s central contract being torn up when the team returned from Australia, and the Mail on Sunday has learned the South Africa-born star caused problems from the outset of the tour. Even more details have emerged of Kevin Pietersen’s fractious relationship with senior England players . Pietersen  attempted to undermine captain Alastair Cook (right) by refusing to attend a team morale dinner . ‘Alastair Cook and [vice-captain] Matt Prior tried to set up a team dinner in Sydney a couple of weeks into the tour,’ a dressing room insider said. ‘They invited the whole squad and said it would cost around £70 a head and would be a good thing to do for team morale early on a long tour. ‘KP made it very obvious from the word go he wasn’t interested at all. He came up with all sorts of reasons not to go. He constantly questioned why he should have to fork out the money and completely undermined Cooky’s attempts to put the dinner on. ‘The dinner eventually went ahead but it was soured by KP’s resistance and there’s no doubt Cooky felt let down by a senior player going against what he wanted to do so early in the tour.’ Sportsmail's insider on Pietersen: 'He constantly questioned why he should have to fork out the money'","England captain Alastair Cook and vice-captain Matt Prior tried to set up a team dinner in Sydney a couple of weeks into the tour for morale .

"A highly vulnerable group of uncontacted Amazon Indians forced out of the rainforest in Brazil has caught flu, it has been confirmed. Members of the unnamed tribe emerged from the rainforest in Brazil near the Peru border and made contact with a settled indigenous community, following 'violent attacks'. However, officials confirmed they caught flu - and have now returned to their tribe, amid fears they could infect them. Scroll down for video . Three of the seven uncontacted Indians who made contact with a settled Ashaninka community near the Brazil-Peru border in June. Authorities have treated them after an outbreak of flu, but fear they could spread it through their tribe . A specialist FUNAI team is in the area to provide help to the newly-contacted group, and a medical unit has been flown in to treat possible epidemics of common respiratory and other diseases to which isolated indigenous groups lack immunity. Seven Indians made peaceful contact with a settled indigenous Ashaninka community near the Envira River in the western Acre state, Brazil, three weeks ago. Funai , Brazil’s Indian Affairs Department, has announced that the group of uncontacted Indians has now returned once more to their forest home. A government health team was dispatched and has treated seven Indians for flu. The team has announced it will reopen a monitoring post on the Envira River which it closed in 2011 when it was overrun by drug traffickers. The emerging news has been condemned as 'extremely worrying' by Survival International, the global movement for tribal peoples’ rights, as epidemics of flu, to which uncontacted Indians lack immunity, have wiped out entire tribes in the past. Brazilian experts believe that the Indians, who belong to the Panoan linguistic group, crossed over the border from Peru into Brazil due to pressures from illegal loggers and drug traffickers on their land. Survival’s Director Stephen Corry said, 'This news could hardly be more worrying – not only have these people confirmed they suffered violent attacks from outsiders in Peru, but they have apparently already caught flu. 'The nightmare scenario is that they return to their former villages carrying flu with them. 'It’s a real test of Brazil’s ability to protect these vulnerable groups. 'Unless a proper and sustained medical program is immediately put in place, the result could be a humanitarian catastrophe.'

It came just days after after Funai, Brazil’s Indian Affairs Department, and Survival International, the global movement for tribal peoples’ rights, warned of the serious risk of such an incident. They say the Peruvian authorities have failed to stop illegal logging on its side of the border. The Indians had been coming increasingly close to the settled Asháninka Indians who live along the Envira River. Nixiwaka Yawanawá, an Indian from Acre state, said, 'This news proves that my uncontacted relatives are threatened by violence and infectious diseases. 'We already know what can happen if the authorities don’t take action to protect them, they will simply disappear. 'They need time and space to decide when they want to make contact and their choices must be respected. They are heroes!'","Seven members of the unnamed tribe emerged from the rainforest in Brazil near the Peru border three weeks ago .

"England 'never doubted' Alastair Cook would remain as captain for the 2015 World Cup, according to Jimmy Anderson. Paceman Anderson hailed Cook's show of character to disregard widespread calls for his head as skipper and lead England to Test series victory over India. England bosses last week confirmed Cook's place as one day captain for next year's short-format World Cup, with 50-over series to come against Sri Lanka, Australia and India. Anderson admitted that off-field distractions hurt England in a battling Test summer against Sri Lanka and India, but said opening batsman Cook remains the right skipper. Jimmy Anderson said that England never doubted that Alastair Cook would remain as captain . 'For us it was never a question really, it was all speculation with the captaincy,' Anderson told Press Association. 'From the players' point of view we never thought anyone else was going to lead us to that World Cup, we never doubted. 'For him I think he's had more low points than most this summer, the amount of chat that was going on about his captaincy in the Test matches then the one-dayers. 'So to show the character he has to come through those, it speaks a lot about the guy. 'It was a huge test of character: it's a credit to himself the way he's handled it all. 'I'm sure he had a lot of doubts in his mind of whether he should have captained the Test team or the one day team. Despite speculation he may be removed as captain, Cook will lead England in the upcoming World Cup . 'But all I can say is from a player's point of view there was never any doubt over who should be captain.' England started their summer with a dismal 1-0 Test series defeat to Sri Lanka before grinding back to form to dispatch India 3-1. England have lost five of their last six one day series, but Anderson still insists the 29-year-old Essex batsman is the ideal figurehead. 'The person who will benefit most is Cooky of course, because the players had no issue with who was going to be captain,' said Anderson, speaking at the Professional Cricket Association's awards night. 'So for him it's nice that chat won't be a distraction now. Alastair Cook's England side lost both their home 50-over series this summer against Sri Lanka and India . 'From that point of view when the distraction of people talking about it goes, it's a good thing for us. 'It's a really exciting winter, with the World Cup at the end. 'The two series we've got, in Sri Lanka and then against Australia and India, it should give us a good chance of preparing well for the World Cup. 'It's an exciting prospect for any player, so all the players are going to do their utmost to get in the World Cup squad. 'There were quite a few distractions throughout the summer, and the way we dealt with it, especially going one-nil down to India then coming back, it was a huge response for us. 'The one day series as it was, with questions being asked about the captaincy, as players we just got on with it. 'Things like that are down to the selection panel not the media. 'We're really excited about the winter and hopefully we can put in a good show.'","Alastair Cook to lead England in next February's Cricket World Cup .

"Andrew Gale has been hit with a further ban and sent on an anger management course for abusing Ashwell Prince — but avoided a disciplinary hearing that could have branded him a racist. The Yorkshire captain admitted ‘improper conduct’ in a compromise agreement with the ECB that sees him banned for the first two first-class matches of next season as well as the last two of this Championship-winning one. Yet it could have been much more serious for Gale had he effectively stood trial after telling Lancashire’s Prince to ‘f*** off back to your own country you Kolpak f*****’ during an ill-tempered Roses match last month. Andrew Gale (right) has been banned for two further matches following his row with Ashwell Prince . The Yorkshire captain will also have to attend an anger management course . Umpires Steve Garrett and Steve O’Shaughnessy reported Gale, who was responding to initial abuse from Prince, on a level two offence but it was upgraded by the ECB after they interviewed Prince and, significantly, his batting partner at the time, Australian Usman Khawaja. Now, though, a deal has been reached with Gale, a serial offender for dissent, being punished for what were crass but surely not racist comments while the ECB have made it clear they believe the Yorkshire captain overstepped the mark. Gale yesterday admitted in an ECB statement regret that his words ‘could have caused offence as a result of the reference to the nationality of the person to whom they were made’. He emphasised this was ‘absolutely’ not his intention. In truth, the banning of Gale from receiving the Championship trophy during the presentation at Trent Bridge was punishment enough without what has become a four-match ban. Even though yesterday’s statement did not categorically clear Gale of racism, he can resume his career next season without an indelible stain on his character.

"World Cup winner Jonny Wilkinson insists rugby union is no more dangerous in the professional era than it has ever been. The 35-year-old former England fly-half suffered more than his fair share of time in the treatment room during an illustrious career which drew to a close at the end of last season. But at the end of a week which saw national coach Stuart Lancaster lose back row Tom Johnson having already faced up to the absence of fellow forwards Alex Corbisiero, Mako Vunipola, Dan Cole, Tom Youngs and Geoff Parling for the autumn internationals, Wilkinson is confident a greater reliance on sports science will protect players, provided they act responsibly themselves. Jonny Wilkinson  receives attention during England's Six Nations match against Italy in 2008 . Jonny Wilkinson pictured with the Rugby World Cup in Newcastle on Friday . Speaking at an event in Newcastle a year to the day before the city hosts its first fixture of the Rugby World Cup 2015, he said: 'I don't necessarily believe there is a great deal more injury going on now since professionalism really kicked in during the late 1990s. 'It happens. Most of it is contact injuries which can't be avoided. The ones you avoid are the ones where you have got to say, 'We can't accept this'. You can't have guys missing seasons because they aren't being looked after properly, pulling muscles in training and those sort of things. 'There is that, but you can't change the fact that guys are going to get bigger. The problem is not so much they are getting bigger, it's that the bigger ones can run faster. That is the issue, because that is what creates the power. 'We need to make sure that guys are well looked after. You have got to listen to players and try to balance up this pressure to succeed all the time. England's Jonny Wilkinson kicks a penalty during extra time in the 2003 World Cup final . 'That's difficult when you have got teams that are suffering relegation issues, teams that are fighting for titles and players coming back from injury. 'You want to say, 'Just play this game for us, you'll be all right and if you can just do this one, we will give you two weeks off'. 'It's a difficult one to fight because I have been in that situation several times and I would always choose to play. It's not clever. But you love rugby and you think, 'I might not get this chance again'. 'But now I am retired, I am just so glad that I can walk around happily, and I know that I can still go to the gym and I can get on a bike and I can run around a little bit. 'You never know what that next knock is going to mean, so the player has to be responsible as well, enough to say, 'Look, I am not actually feeling good, this doesn't feel right' because that's the only way that people get the right feedback, if you speak honestly.' Wilkinson, who was sidelined by a succession of serious ankle, shoulder, knee and groin injuries during a 17-year-playing career capped by the drop-goal which clinched the 2003 World Cup, admits retirement has brought some relief from the pressures top-class rugby put on his body. Jonny Wilkinson insists rugby union is no more dangerous in the professional era than it has ever been . However, he is not sorry to see the back of the powerhouse runners - and those from Samoa and Tonga in particular - who at times left him clasping at fresh air in his latter days at Toulon. He said: 'That was one of the reasons, other than the pressure, why I gave up in France. I was pretty glad to get out of the way of some of these guys. 'Some of the wingers over there are incredible.

"Speedball Tiggy Wiggy is poised to try to win two Group One prizes in eight days, with trainer Richard Hannon indicating his Cheveley Park Stakes heroine is likely to run in the Prix de L’Abbaye at Longchamp a week on Sunday. After she beat Anthem Alexander by three-quarters of a length, Coral make the flying filly 7-2 favourite to become the first two-year-old winner of all-age Abbaye since Sigy in 1978. The big question is whether regular jockey Richard Hughes will be able to ride. The 8st 4lb, who will be allocated against older sprinters, is 2lb below the lightest he has managed in the last 12 months. Speedball Tiggy Wiggy (right) wins at the Cheveley Park Stakes and could run at Longchamp next Sunday . But the champion jockey argued that even putting up a little overweight might be worth it, given his partnership with Tiggy Wiggy. Hughes, who reckons Tiggy Wiggy is the fastest two-year-old he has ridden, added: ‘If I would have to carry too much overweight, I would be the first one to say you are better off getting someone else. ‘But if I was within 2lb, I would like to keep the ride.’ Tiggy Wiggy, who has now twice avenged her Queen Mary Stakes defeat at Royal Ascot at the hands of Anthem Alexander, has won six of her eight races this year, including York’s Lowther Stakes. Trainer Richard Hannon (left) talks with Speedball Tiggy Wiggy's regular jockey Richard Hughes . She has been beaten only when not allowed to utilise her blistering pace from the stalls. The tactical lesson has been learnt. Hannon said: ‘She is two-year-old of the year for me. That was a very good Cheveley Park and a very good Lowther she won. They are the best fillies around.’ Asked about the French raid, Hannon said: ‘The Abbaye comes at a good time, there are no great Breeders’ Cup options. She is in great form. We’ll go there.’ The other big two-year-old race on the Newmarket card, the Group Two Royal Lodge Stakes, was won by Andrew Balding’s Elm Park. He could run in Doncaster’s Racing Post Trophy next month and will be campaigned as a Derby prospect.","Trainer Richard Hannon claims Speedball Tiggy Wiggy could run in the Prix de l'Abbaye at Longchamp next weekend .

"Rugby league is mourning the death of Australian half-back Greg Mackey, who captained Hull to Premiership success in 1991 and also played in England for Warrington and Huddersfield. Mackey, who was diagnosed with bowel cancer in December 2011, suffered a heart attack and passed away at his home in Sydney on Wednesday at the age of 52, the Warrington club announced. A statement said: 'Warrington Wolves were sad to learn of the passing of former captain Greg Mackey on Wednesday 24 September at the age of 52.' Greg Mackey, who captained Hull to Premiership success in 1991 has died at the age of 52 . Mackey also played for Warrington in two different spells between 1989-90 and 1992-96 . Mackey began his career at South Sydney in 1980 and also played for Illawarra Steelers and Canterbury before moving to England in 1989. He made just nine appearances for Warrington before receiving a lucrative offer from Hull, where as captain and stand-off, he won the Harry Sunderland Trophy as man of the match as the Airlie Birds beat Warrington 14-4 in the 1990-91 Premiership final at Old Trafford. After making 94 consecutive appearances for Hull, Mackey returned to Warrington in the summer of 1992 and went on to make 98 consecutive appearances for them, which is still a club record, and played in their 24-0 defeat by the touring Kangaroos at Wilderspool in 1994. Mackey, who also spent the winter of 1983-84 playing in France for Paris Chatillon XIII, finished his career at Huddersfield in 1996, the first season of Super League, before returning with his family to Sydney, where he worked in the telecoms industry.

"Battersea Bridge in London is wonky according to Apple Maps . When people get their hands on an Apple iPhone 5 tomorrow, there will be one familiar icon missing. Google Maps is no longer on the iPhone, after Apple decided to go it alone and produce their own Maps app with some help from data providers such as TomTom. But when it comes to the visual side of things, Apple faces a few bumps in the road for instance, Colchester seems covered under a permanent veil of cloud. Meanwhile, certain roads - such as Battersea Bridge in London - seem a little awkward for your average motorist. Last night the firm released the updated . software for existing iPhones and iPads which replaced Google's Maps . with Apple's . But it instantly faced a barrage of criticism from users who . complained about missing towns, misplaced villages, satellite images . covered by cloud, incorrect searches and even a farm identified as an . airport. As the iPhone 5 launches, along with the new iOS software, many more errors are likely to come to light over the next few weeks. Scroll down for video . Apple's view of Colchester (left) is shrouded in cloud, while Google (right) has a clear view . Albert Bridge in Apple's 3D map (left) is distorted, while Google (right) shows a more realistic version . The new Maps: With Google removed from the iPhone, users have been getting to grips with the new - but sometimes inaccurate - solution from Apple . Errors noticed by users and tech reviewers include: . The Apple service is server-based, the firm said, so the data is constantly being refined and improved. Users are also encouraged to use a 'Report a Problem' feature to point out errors. A search for Manchester United Football Club instead brings up Sale United. Looking for Stratford upon Avon sends users to a TV studio . With maps being one of the most-used . features on smartphones, Apple may find themselves in a rare situation . of widespread customer dissatisfaction. Apple decided to drop Google Maps from the phone in June. The smartphone market is rapidly polarising between the iPhone and Google's Android phones, and - along with Apple filing many patent lawsuits against Android's biggest manufacturers - relationships have become strained over the last five years. It is a far cry from when the iPhone was first announced, with Google integration sold as a key feature of the phone. Users who are dissatisfied with Apple's map offering can only access Google Maps by using the browser-based version, which does not offer the same usability as a bespoke app. TomTom defended the integrity of the map software, saying it provided only the data, and was not responsible for how Apple used it within the app. A spokesman said: 'The user experience is determined by adding additional features to the map application such as visual imagery. 'User experience fully depends on the choices these manufacturers make. 'We are confident about our map quality, as selling 65 million portable navigation devices across the world and more than 1.4m TomTom apps for iPhone in the past two years reaffirms this quality.' Apple's maps also feature 3D versions of major cities such as London. The poor service, if it continues, is likely to also impact many businesses. The BBC quotes a Denver-based blogger who runs a business repairing Apple goods. He said: 'This is incredibly different from using Google Maps. 'It's a tremendous step backwards and something that cripples iOS for Apple's customers. 'I [searched] ""iPhone Repair"" and ""iPad Repair"" since that's relevant to our business. The results broke my heart. 'All of the work I've put into our local recognition is completely gone.' Meanwhile, pilots could be misled into trying to make an emergency landing in a farm because of an error on a new Apple map tool, Justice Minister Alan Shatter said. The minister has notified the technology giant of a mistake in his south Dublin constituency and asked for it to be urgently corrected. Apple's new iOS 6 maps application has placed the standard airport map symbol on the spot of a 35-acre site called Airfield, in Dundrum - home to a city farm, gardens and cafe. Sarah . Rotman Epps, an analyst at Forrester Research, said: 'Apple believes . that they can deliver a better experience for customers . than Google. 'But in the short term, Google has a better mapping application, and . iPhone customers will suffer.' However Michael . Gartenberg, an analyst at Gartner Inc, said - despite the short-term pain - it was a wise business decision. He said: 'It doesn’t make sense for Apple to outsource a key part of their entire . ecosystem to Google.' 'In context of Airfield there are a variety of possible alternative images that could be utilised such as a cow, a goat, a sheep, a flower or any indeed other type of plant, as Airfield operates a nursery,' Mr Shatter said. 'An aircraft is an entirely inappropriate flight of imagination.' The error prompted Dublin Airport Authority to tweet: 'Just in case anybody is confused @DublinAirport is not moving to the southside. #mapfail.' Mr Shatter said he accepts mistakes can be made but added that he was surprised to discover Airfield being marked as an airport. 'Clearly the designation is not only wrong but is dangerously misleading in that it could result in a pilot, unfamiliar with the area, in an emergency situation and without other available information, attempting a landing,' he said. 'I have arranged that Apple be informed of the error and requested that it be urgently corrected.'","Apple is fixing problems as they go along, but users are finding many errors with the app .

"A woman who was told she probably only had flu when she went to hospital suffering cold sweats and pains in her arm was diagnosed four days later with cancer - on the same day her late sister was also diagnosed with the disease. Tara Deacon is now trying to fulfill her bucket list after Hodgkin's lymphoma returned and doctors said there was nothing more they could do, seven months after younger sister Jade passed away after her own brave battle. Tara, 26, from the Sunshine Coast in Queensland, first started feeling unwell one night in 2010, when she began suffering sharp pains and bouts of cold sweats. She drove herself to the Nambour Hospital but decided to leave when she was forced to wait for hours and still had not seen a doctor. Tara Deacon (left) and sister Jade supported each other through chemotherapy, radiation treatment and their bone marrow transplants about four years ago . Lymphoma is the most common blood cancer and the third most common childhood cancer in the World. The causes of lymphoma are not yet known. Exposure to radiation and certain chemicals puts some people at higher risk. For people diagnosed with Hodgkin lymphoma, prognosis is generally good, with a five year survival rate of more than 87% in Australia. People diagnosed with non-Hodgkin lymphoma in Australia have a five year survival rate of 71%. 'I thought I was having a heart attack from those sharp pains,' she told Daily Mail Australia. 'It took forever to see someone at the emergency room that night and my partner needed to go to work. 'I told the receptionist to not worry about it and I would just go home and sleep through it.' 'The lady told me that it could just be a cold or flu so I thought it wasn't anything serious and left.' Tara returned the next day, when she had a CT scan of her abdomen and a bone marrow biopsy. At the same time, she noticed her sister Jade, who was with her at hospital, had a 'massive lump on her neck' so she got checked too. Four days later, the sisters were both told they had Hodgkin's lymphoma by a specialist at the Royal Brisbane Hospital. Tara  remembers started noticing sharp pains down her right arm and chest after dinner in 2010 and rushed herself to hospital . Sadly, Jade (right) passed away in February at the age of 22, leaving her now five year old daughter Acaica (left) in the care of her dad and Tara . While there is no known genetic link with the disease, the sisters supported each other through chemotherapy and radiation treatment and their bone marrow transplants about four years ago. 'We supported each other through the tough battle - we just kept going,' Tara said. Despite her determination, Jade died in February at the age of 22 when her body failed to accept her donated bone marro. Her death left her then four year old daughter Acaica without a mother, and in the care of her dad and aunt Tara. More tragedy was to follow - three months later Tara’s cancer returned and she was told she had only 18 months to live. ‘My advice to everyone is to get checked regularly, ' she said . Now, Tara has started a bucket list of things she wants to complete and will fly to NZ on Monday for a 12 day getaway with her partner Shane, who raised money to make the trip possible . Now, Tara has started a bucket list of things she wants to do and is due to fly out to New Zealand  with her partner Shane on Monday for a 12-day holiday. ‘Shane organised a fundraising (drive) to make this trip possible for me,’ she said. ‘After Christmas, around New Year's, I am hoping to hire a campervan trailer and travel to Wagga Wagga to see family or Melbourne.' She said she is enjoying every second she has left and hopes to go up in a hot-air balloon, go on relaxing cruises and travel around parts of Australia. In Australia in 2011, there were 1371 deaths caused by non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and 72 deaths caused by Hodgkin lymphoma. Lymphoma Australia chief executive Sharon Millman spoke to Daily Mail Australia, and said that lymphoma awareness in Australia needs to be on par with awareness of breast cancer and prostate cancer. 'Every two hours someone is diagnosed with lymphoma, and every five hours we lose someone to the disease,' 'At the moment a lot of people don't know anything about it, so we want to raise awareness so that when people are diagnosed they at least know what it is.' Ms. Millman noted that often people aren't even aware that lymphoma is anything to worry about, despite it being the fifth most common cancer in the world. 'We don't want people to be afraid of the unknown. We want them to have the facts and be equipped to deal with it.' Today is World Lymphoma Day and Lymphoma Australia is encouraging people to learn more about the disease and get themselves checked regularly.

Stretcher: The rescuers, using powerful spotlights, were lowered to the injured girl in the dark . Portland Fire and Rescue says a girl in her early teens sustained life-threatening injuries when she fell more than 40 feet off the cliffs at a popular hiking and climbing spot. Crews from Portland Fire and Rescue arrived minutes after receiving reports on Friday evening saying the girl had gone over the edge. Hunt: The girl, who was severely hurt and now had life-threatening injuries, was reported hurt in the park in Portland, Oregon . Careful: Fellow firefighters looked on as the two men lowered themselves during the rescue mission . Initially, firefighters weren't sure where the teen was located, according to Firefighter Gabriel Watson. Firefighters started searching with powerful lights from the top of the cliffs, while others looked at the bottom, and eventually spotted her moving down below and set up a high-angle rope rescue system. 'Upon reaching the patient, firefighters performed a rapid evaluation and determined the need for urgent evacuation,' Watson said, according to KOIN 6. 'The firefighters then immediately began treating the woman’s many injuries,' she added.

Officials said that after treating the girl, they carried her in a litter one-third of a mile to an ambulance, which transported her to Legacy Emanuel Medical Center. Watson said it remains unknown what caused the girl to fall. The hospital said Saturday that it could give no information about her condition without the name. 'Hikers should stick to established pathways, follow posted signage and steer away cliffs or unknown areas–especially during the evening when visibility is limited,' Watson advised.","Rescue crews arrived minutes after receiving reports that the girl had gone over the edge at Rocky Butte in Northeast Portland .

"Senior Nationalists have drawn up plans to demand a £30billion 'divorce settlement' from the UK if Scotland votes Yes to independence. They want talks to begin 'within days' of a Yes vote, expecting Westminster to agree to what would be the most expensive break-up of any country in the history of international relations. The Nationalists will demand a share of every single asset owned by the British State, from the Channel Tunnel to the military bases in the Falkland Islands. Scroll down for video . Battle: If Alex Salmond is victorious in his campaign for Scottish independence, opposed by Alistair Darling, he will begin a bid to claim one-twelfth of the UK Government's assets . Overall, the UK owns £337billion-worth of property, assets and equipment around the world, from embassies and consulates to art works and aircraft carriers. Scotland has one-twelfth of the UK's population, which the SNP believes would entitle Scotland to claim a share worth just under £30billion. If Scots do vote Yes on Thursday, Alex Salmond will immediately start demanding that Scotland gets its share of these assets - even before the celebrations of his fellow Nationalists have died down. It is understood that senior Nationalists expect the process to start as early as next Monday - four days after the referendum. The SNP would then get its negotiating team in place, ready to start the preliminary talks on the break-up of the UK - and they would expect the UK Government to do the same. Claim: The British Museum has been valued at more than £200million according to an official document . Dispute: The Channel Tunnel is one of the British assets which the Scottish Nationalists believe they have a part-share in . A senior figure in the SNP said yesterday: 'We are ready to go. We know who will be in our team.' Alex Salmond's senior aides have also been studying a little-known list of all the buildings, assets and equipment owned by the UK Government at home and abroad. As a result, they believe they know exactly what is owned by the UK Government and will submit a list of what they want to come to Scotland on Independence Day. 'Everything is in there,' said an SNP insider. 'The only thing is that the asset register has not been updated for a few years, so it is conceivable that many things in there will actually be worth more than the stated value in the document.' The items they believe they should get a share of include the Channel Tunnel, the British Embassy in Paris and even Number Ten Downing Street. The Nationalists have warned they will walk away from the liabilities of the UK - including its mountainous debt - unless they get thier way on a share of the assets. Headquarters: 10 Downing Street, which this week flew the saltire flag, . The assets of the UK Government include every piece of military equipment as well as works of art on display at UK bases around the world - and the SNP wants Scotland to get its population share of each one. The list includes: . The Scottish Government made it clear before the campaign started that this would be the approach taken by SNP Ministers in any post-referendum negotiations. Base: The UK's military facilities on the Falkland Islands are also included in the list of assets . A spokesman declared: 'Scotland and Scottish taxpayers have contributed to funding all the assets owned by the UK state over many years. It is only fair and reasonable that Scotland should receive a fair share of the value of these assets on independence.' Indeed, the SNP asset-grabbing approach was laid out in its White Paper on Independence, published last November. This made it clear that Ministers would expect to get a population share of UK assets and, while it would be impossible to give Scotland an actual cut of every asset, Scotland would expect at least the financial value of the country's share of the UK's assets. The UK Government has refused to even admit that independence might cause the break-up of the British state and UK Governments has, at least publicly, refused to put contingency plans in place. But it is understood that UK Ministers now realise the scale of the negotiations they might have to enter into if Scots vote Yes this week. Some of the negotiations over the sharing out of the UK's assets will be relatively straightforward. There are already many UK Government buildings in Scotland which would immediately transfer over to the Scottish Government after independence. But even if every building, every piece of equipment, artwork and asset in Scotland was added up, it would still leave the Scottish Government claiming a multi-billion share of the rest of the UK's assets. Nationalist negotiators expect their UK counterparts to give Scotland the cash value. But a UK Government spokesman did not accept that Scotland would be given everything the SNP is demanding if Scots do leave the UK. He said: 'A vote to leave the UK is a vote to leave its institutions. The division of assets and liabilities would be a matter for negotiation between the continuing UK and an independent Scotland.'","Nationalists have drawn up detailed plans to claim a share of UK assets .

"Boss Paul Lambert insisted he always knew Roy Keane was the right fit for Aston Villa - and was too good for TV. The former Manchester United midfielder was working as a pundit for ITV, alongside his role as the Republic of Ireland's assistant manager, before joining Villa. He replaced the sacked Ian Culverhouse in July as a surprise choice to work alongside Lambert. Paul Lambert insisted he always knew Roy Keane was the right fit for Aston Villa - and was too good for TV . Villa have been superb so far in the Premier League - beating Liverpool at Anfield last week . Lambert and Keane are both known for their similar uncompromising styles to management . But, ahead of Saturday's Barclays Premier League visit of Arsenal, Lambert believes the move has been perfect. 'The two of us are really strong characters. I knew he had a lot of football knowledge that was unfairly tarnished. His knowledge meant he was too good to be a TV pundit,' he said. 'To get him back in the game was great. I love working with him, we have a laugh. 'Not everything is serious. I beat him at the crossbar challenge nearly every day. 'When I was thinking about people to bring in, I know it probably raised a few eyebrows, 'How's that going to work?' Nobody sees the logic in it. I just knew in my gut it would work. Alright, there will be times when we don't win games but we'll never break anything. 'He's been great around the place, with the staff and the lads. He likes a laugh as well. I don't think he's the big bad guy out there that. He's somebody I know I can rely on. 'I never had any doubts. He was the first port of call when I knew I had to get somebody in.' Second placed Villa will go top, for 24 hours, as leaders Chelsea do not play Manchester City until Sunday, with victory against the Gunners. Keane had his own battles with Arsenal as a United player, memorably squaring up to Patrick Vieira in the Highbury tunnel but Lambert said Keane's winning-mentality shone through. 'The Arsenal tunnel was pretty small at that time wasn't it, there was no hiding place,' he said. 'If you look at his football career he is probably the best midfielder to come out of this country. There is no getting away from that. He was a winner and you make no apologies for being a winner.'","Aston Villa have been the Premier League's surprise package .

"Carrow Road was stunned when Charlton executed a textbook smash and grab — scoring an 86th-minute goal to deal Norwich a first league defeat since the opening game of the season. Only a tiny corner of Charlton fans were united in song after a shot by Johnnie Jackson from distance was deflected off Russell Martin and beyond John Ruddy’s outstretched arm. Ruddy had only been tested once before that. ‘We’re staggered that we’ve lost,’ said Norwich manager Neil Adams. ‘We did enough to win two or three games. Except for not scoring a goal, we did everything right. I couldn’t criticise anything. Charlton captain Johnnie Jackson (left) celebrates his goal as John Ruddy sits dejected on the turf . Stephen Henderson (left), Tal Ben Haim (centre), and Andre Bikey (right) celebrate Charlton's win .

Attendance: 25,983 . ‘We made chances, had penalty appeals turned down and to make it even more disappointing we’ve been done and not even come away with a point. It’s a cruel game.’ Tempers spilled over after the final whistle with several players embroiled in a fracas. Charlton manager Bob Peeters dragged 17-year-old Karlan Ahearne-Grant, who was making his debut, away from a skirmish with Norwich captain Martin. ‘You don’t see him picking on Andre Bikey,’ said Peeters afterwards, referring to his defender who is built like a rugby prop forward. ‘They pick on the little one.’ Adams turned toward the dugout, hands on his chest and head tilted to the skies in through the second half when Nathan Redmond was denied, then Wes Hoolahan’s follow-up shot was cleared on the line by a scrambling Rhoys Wiggins. He must have wondered what his side had to do to win this game. They played elegant football and tested keeper Stephen Henderson several times but the Charlton defence stood resolute. Steven Whittaker of Norwich City (left) flicks the ball away from Rhoys Wiggins . Bradley Johnson shouts as his goal is disallowed for a foul on Charlton keeper Stephen Henderson . Carrow Road on Tuesday night, during Norwich's Championship game against Charlton . Adams protested after referee Michael Russell waved away a second-half penalty appeal for what seemed an obvious handball by Bikey. Earlier Russell had disallowed a goal, probably correctly, for a push on Henderson by Bradley Johnson before Martin poked the ball into the net. Norwich’s best opportunity to establish a lead came after only three minutes when Hoolahan played a tremendous ball to release Lewis Grabban. The striker had only the keeper to beat but his low shot to the left was palmed away by Henderson. Hoolahan again found Grabban in space soon after but he shot wide from distance. Charlton, one of only five sides in English football still unbeaten this season, owe much of that record to experienced defensive duo Tal Ben Haim and Bikey, who made several crucial tackles. ‘They were excellent,’ said Peeters.

"Mike Ashley may now hold the key to the power battle at Rangers after it was confirmed he has more than doubled his stake at Ibrox. A statement to the Stock Exchange revealed French bank BNP Paribas purchased 4.26 million shares from fund managers Hargreave Hale on behalf of the Newcastle United owner earlier this week. The £850,000 deal leaves Ashley with an 8.9 per cent stake in the club. He is currently limited to under 10 per cent via an agreement with the SFA but already has significant commercial influence at Ibrox through the retail contracts held by his Sports Direct firm. He also owns the naming rights to the stadium. Mike Ashley has increased his stake in Rangers to 8.92 per cent the Glasgow club have confirmed . There were suggestions last night that Ashley could now go further by pushing for an Extraordinary General Meeting to force a shake-up of the Ibrox board. The billionaire tycoon is perceived as being the main rival to Dave King and his allies in the struggle over Rangers’ long-term future and this latest development could yet prove significant. King has previously stated a willingness to invest up to £30million, but those funds would only be forthcoming in a new share issue that provided boardroom control. Ashley saw Newcastle lose 1-0 to Stoke City at the Britannia stadium in their recent encounter . Such a move would require the backing of 75 per cent of Rangers shareholders and substantially weaken the existing powerbase. While Ashley’s intentions are not yet clear, he has now upped his potential ability to contribute to any veto. His investment comes after last week’s confirmation that football board chairman Sandy Easdale – who has publically backed Ashley – holds voting rights over a 26.1 per cent stake. The Union of Fans have already urged Easdale not to oppose a new share issue that would open the door for King. Ashley declined to invest in the stop-gap £3.13m open offer Rangers held last month and the £850,000 he has now splashed out will not go to the club as he increased his stake via the market. The troubled Ibrox outfit are likely to experience another cash shortfall by the end of the year, with reports on Tyneside previously speculating that Ashley could consider offering a substantial loan to provide funding. Newcastle released a statement on September 12 insisting Ashley won't sell Newcastle at any price . The Londoner has become the second largest single shareholder in Rangers behind Laxey Partners but currently has limited scope to up his personal holding due to SFA guidelines on dual ownership. Any attempt to move beyond 10 per cent would have to go before the board of the governing body, backed by a detailed business case. However, his financial power and commercial contracts already establish him as a pivotal player even on his existing stake. Meanwhile, Rangers have accepted an SFA ban for Bilel Mohsni but will contest the suspension offered to Kris Boyd. Mohsni was cited by new compliance officer Tony McGlennan for appearing to strike Liam Fontaine during Monday night’s 3-1 defeat from Hibernian. The Tunisian centre-back will serve a total of three games under SFA rules as he was sent off during a pre-season friendly against Derby. Boyd was charged over a head-to-head confrontation with Jordan Forster but the Ibrox club have rejected the two-game ban put forward. His case will now go before a principal hearing next Thursday.","Rangers confirm Mike Ashley has increased his stake to 8.92 per cent .

"A Christian family was stunned to discover their teenage daughter was told to take off her 'virginity rocks' t-shirt - because it could lead to awkward conversations about sex. Chloe Rubiano, an eighth-grade student at Fayetteville, Arkansas, was told to replace the item with a standard-issue gym shirt because it 'opens up too many doors for conversations'. Miss Rubiano had bought the t-shirt at a Christian festival, and wanted to wear it to school because it represented her beliefs, but was told by the vice-principal of Ramay Junior High that it could be a classroom distraction. Banned: Chloe Rubiano, an eighth grader, was told by school authorities that she can't wear her 'virginity rocks' shirt to school . Beliefs: Miss Rubiano, who got her shirt at a Christian festival, said that the shirt represents her beliefs, and she was surprised that anybody should take issue with it . Her mother, Bambi Crozier, said she was surprised by the school's decision to ban the shirt, which says on the reverse 'I'm loving my husband and I haven't even married him'. She told 5News: 'This is part of sex ed to me. Virginity is where you need to be - it represents what she believes.' 'Represents what she believes': Bambi Crozier, pictured, said the school's decision surprised her . Miss Rubiano added: 'I just really like the shirt because I was always raised that way. I didn’t really think anyone would make a big deal out of it.' The family has said that they thought the shirt was appropriate wear for school, even though the message is bold. But they also said they can understand the school's point of view and that it is important for Miss Rubiano to do what the staff at school tell her.

"Virgil van Dijk has issued a ringing endorsement of Ronny Deila’s regime. The Celtic manager made headlines this week as he enforced a stringent approach to fitness and diet. Seen in some quarters as a criticism of the reign of predecessor Neil Lennon, an unrepentant Deila insisted that any player not buying into his methods would soon be surplus to requirements. But having helped the Scottish champions move joint top of their Europa League group with a narrow win over Dinamo Zagreb, Dutch defender Van Dijk stressed the squad were prepared to go to any lengths to improve their chances of competing at the highest level. Virgil van Dijk has been in impressive form for Celtic and helped his side to a win over Dinamo Zagreb . ‘It’s good for us all, it’s not something that makes you worse or anything else. He wants to make us better players and wants to get everything out of us,’ Van Dijk said. ‘I think that’s a good sign. But he is also busy trying to win games and that’s the most important thing in football.’ Asked if the strict diet Deila is imposing was something he’d experienced in Holland, Van Dijk replied: ‘No, but I think if you play at the highest level then you should look into it. If you want to play at the highest level and get everything out of yourself then, of course, you need to do what it takes. ‘Diet and fitness are important. They belong there. But the most important thing is to win games. ‘It’s his (Deila’s) opinion. He’s the gaffer and he wants us to do it. That’s his right and I think it will only make us better human beings and better players.’ The mutual respect between player and manager was apparent again yesterday when Deila described Van Dijk as the ‘perfect defender’. Van Dijk stressed the squad were prepared to go to any lengths to improve their chances of competing . And he urged the towering centre half to hold fire for a major European club after Celtic resisted offers from Southampton and Sunderland in the last transfer window. Deila insisted the sky is the limit for his £9million rated Van Dijk and said: ‘Virgil is better now and improves all the time. He looks fit and sharp and for me I hope when he leaves Celtic he goes to a top international club and we’re talking about one that could win the Champions League. ‘I don’t have so much experience of those things, but in my opinion if he gets consistency in his play and is even more disciplined in his structure I can’t see his weaknesses. ‘He’s quick, he’s strong, he’s good on the ball, he’s calm, he reads the play well, he’s good in the air. You name it, he has everything. ‘He is the perfect defender. But he is his own enemy, he has to step up every day and go to training to get even better but I think he is improving all the time.’ Jason Denayer on-loan at Celtic from Manchester City has been called up to the Belgium squad . Deila is also delighted with Jason Denayer’s call-up to the Belgium squad for the forthcoming Euro 2016 ties with Andorra and Bosnia – and hopes it can help to keep the Manchester City loan star for one more season. ‘You see what it does to have a good environment and work in the right way, this is what you can get out of players,’ he said. ‘It’s something I learn and you learn when you get into a big club. ‘It’s about getting the best out of the players and with Jason we have done that. ‘I hope that we can build him up but also keep him for the Champions League if we win the league and get into the Champions League next year - that he can be an important player in that role as well. ‘We have a very good co-operation with City, there are good bonds there. We talk well together. He is very young still to be playing at this level and if we win the league and go into the Champions League it would be a perfect scenario for him because it is a very high level and he maybe needs a couple of years there. They are happy with what is happening here with him.’","Southampton and Sunderland bid for £9m rated Van Dijk in the summer .

"It's a modern-day equivalent of The Good Life – the 1970s hit TV comedy in which middle-class couple Tom and Barbara Good set out to live self-sufficiently from the produce of their suburban garden. The co-operative of residents living on the Hockerton Housing Project  in Nottinghamshire generate their own energy, grow their own food, rear their own animals and supply their own water. The difference is that in this 2014 version, the residents enjoy ‘all mod cons’: dishwashers, fridges, freezers, wi-fi, broadband and satellite TV. Green room: A four-bedroom eco-pad - and a stake in the unique community at the he Hockerton Housing Project in Nottinghamshire - is on sale for £500,000 . The project, which comprises five eco-houses, was set up in the late 1990s by Peter Rajan and a group  of friends interested in sustainability. Now a rare opportunity to join this select community has arisen, because Peter is leaving to build a new eco-home from scratch and is selling  his four-bedroom eco-pad – and  his stake in the unique community – for £500,000. He is quick to point out that among the benefits, the buyer will no longer have to pay heating bills or water rates. ‘Instead of utilising a central heating system,’ he says, ‘the houses act as a thermal store for radiant heat from the sun, so the conservatories at the front of the building, which are south-facing, heat the fabric  of the building.’ Earth on the roofs helps to seal in the warmth. Green neighbours: Residents Robert Cartwright and Liz Laine with their five-year-old son Jack . Hot property: The solar panels on the roof of The Hockerton Housing Project, left, and right, the property for sale . ‘When it comes to power, the houses utilise photovoltaic panels and wind turbines to provide electricity,’ Peter says. He adds: ‘Across the whole year we’re net producers of power. The houses actually produce more electricity than they consume.’ The homes are connected to the National Grid, allowing the community to fall back on mains electricity if necessary. ‘We . have a drinking-water system that takes rainwater from the conservatory . roofs and treats it,’ Peter adds. He says that the washing- water . system, which produces a slightly lower quality of water, takes water . from the land, treats it through sand filters and then feeds it back  to . the houses. Peter believes he saves about £1,500 a year on electricity bills and a further £300 a year on water bills. The . co-operative is spread across ten acres. There are vegetable plots, a . greenhouse, an orchard – with apples, pears and plums – and land for . sheep, chickens and bees. A lake on the site provides fish. ‘The . experience of living here – waking up in the morning and looking out on . to a lake with water lilies and fish swimming in it – always raises the . spirits,’ Peter says. The residents, who meet every week to discuss how . best to maintain their green existence, are expected to clock up a set . number of hours working the land. ‘One . of the differences between this place and an ordinary house is that you . have more contact with your neighbours,’ Peter adds. ‘The community . works by virtue of co-operation. You have the opportunity to plan things . together and achieve things that you wouldn’t normally do.’ Peter will be moving out together with . his new partner. He says: ‘My family has grown up and moved away so . it’s come to the time really to think about moving on. 'The house is . probably larger than I need now and that’s not very sustainable.’ Green living: The kitchen in the eco house of Pete Rajan at The Hockerton Housing Project in Southwell, Nottinghamshire . The houses are sold on a leasehold basis. The leases run for 999 years and all began in 1998. The ground rent is £30 per year. The leases grant rights to all the services required to run the houses – water, electricity, waste-water treatment – and ensure that the leaseholders maintain the land co-operatively between the five households. The eco-pads have become a magnet for middle-class professionals. An illustrator, a psychologist and an acupuncturist are just some of the people who have left behind conventional households for the eco-retreat. Company director Robert Cartwright and Citizens Advice Bureau advocate Liz Laine swapped a cramped two-bedroom flat in North London for a house in the community, where they live with their five-year-old son Jack. They now combine working from home with commuting to London or Birmingham. They have an electric car which they use to buy the commodities not supplied by the project. ‘Before moving to Hockerton we lived just off Camden High Street  in a top-floor flat – pretty noisy but  it was great being in the centre of things,’ Liz says. ‘But we had been to visit here and learned that one of the houses was up for sale. We were very keen to move out of London, and thinking about starting a family.’ She explains how the community shares the workload: ‘We divide up the way that we grow our food so each family will be responsible for a different thing; so we grow the peas and the beans and we also grow peppers and chillies. I’m particularly keen on making more use of our poly-tunnel so that we can grow food for a longer season through the year.’ Rob adds: ‘A lot of people expect composting toilets because it’s an eco-house but it’s just a normal home. We live a normal life, we just reduce our energy bills significantly. ‘There are aspects of living in London that we miss, but I certainly prefer living here.’","Four-bedroom Nottinghamshire eco home on the market for £500,000 .

"Paul Lambert insists Frank Lampard has made Manchester City stronger and believes he is Chelsea's loss. The Aston Villa boss reckons Lampard's arrival has only served to help City, ahead of their visit to Villa Park on Saturday. Lampard is on loan at the Etihad from New York City after leaving Stamford Bridge in the summer and has netted four goals in five games. Frank Lampard joined Manchester City on loan from new club New York City FC . Paul Lambert (left) believes Lampard (right) has made City stronger since joining . The midfielder scored the equaliser against former club Chelsea in the clash at the Etihad . The 36-year-old scored twice at Villa Park in May 2013 to break Bobby Tambling's all-time scoring record for Chelsea. And Lambert is not surprised at Lampard's form this season, insisting he is still on top of his game. He said: 'He looks really top-drawer. I don't know him, but from the outside looking in everything about him is old-school. 'It doesn't matter how much he was getting to what he's getting now - I think you'll get him playing the same way. That's a big testament to him. He was always going to play the way he is playing. Maybe it's Chelsea's loss a little bit. 'Him coming in has made (City) stronger, no doubt about it.' Lampard won 11 major honours during his time at Chelsea, including the Europa League in 2013 (right) Defending Barclays Premier League champions City also added Bacary Sagna, Fernando and £32million defender Eliaquim Mangala to their squad in the summer. 'I think they're stronger,' said Lambert. 'The lads who have come in have certainly enhanced their strength. They are a powerful, powerful side.' Villa stunned Manuel Pellegrini's side when they won 3-2 at home last season as they fought back from 1-0 and 2-1 down before Andreas Weimann's winner. And Lambert believes his sixth-placed side can shock City again - but would prefer an easier game. He added: 'You wouldn't want to come back twice. They are a top side, no doubt about it. 'They and Chelsea are the strongest sides physically in the league. But on any given day you can win a game.'","Paul Lambert believes Frank Lampard's move to the Etihad has made City stronger .

The 100ft-stretch of pavement in the Chinese city of Chongqing has a lane specially painted for people who have their eyes glued to their screens. It has a picture of a phone etched on the ground, the word 'cell phone' written down and a thick white line separating it from the rest of the pavement.

The lane was set up in response to the growing number of people who are addicted to their phone - which is a major issue in China. The idea for the mobile phone lane, on Foreigner Street, appears to have been copied almost exactly from a project by a television programme on the National Geographic channel earlier this year. That programme found only a few people changed which side of the pavement they walked on after spotting the signs. The lane has a picture of a phone painted on the ground, the word 'cell phone' written down and a thick white line separating it from the rest of the pavement .

"Neighbors of Erika Murray, the Massachusetts mother accused of hiding the death of three of her children, said they would see poorly dressed infants playing outside her home which they described as 'squalid'. They described the smell at 23 St. Paul Street in Blackstone as atrocious and said that the home, which was discovered by police to be infested with vermin and soiled diapers, was a mess for years. 'I don't know how many times I've seen those children outside no shoes, no clothes on, eating out of a cracker box and drinking soda. This was 6:30, 7 o'clock in the morning,' said Marie White to NECN in an exclusive interview. Squalor: Neighbors of Erika Murray said that her house was kept in a state of disrepair for years before her arrest on Thursday . Murray was arrested on Thursday after detectives already investigating reckless endangerment discovered the bodies of three children inside her home. Shocked: Marie White and her husband said that they would see Murray's children under dressed outside her home . Four other children aged 13, 10, six and three months were taken into protective custody afterwards. Murray has been charged with fetal death concealment, witness intimidation and permitting substantial injury to a child. She is being held without bail. Meanwhile, the search continued for more possible bodies at the filty, vermin-infested home in Blackstone, Massachusetts where four other children previously were removed into state custody. The two youngest children have been also receiving medical treatment after showing signs of long-term neglect. Neither child has birth records. The three-year-old cannot walk, has poor muscle tone and only makes a few sounds, the Boston Globe reported. A six-month-old baby is extremely sensitive to sunlight. The father of the children apparently did not know he had two younger children, according to investigators. Ms Murray appeared disheveled as she was arraigned in Uxbridge District Court on Friday morning. Scroll down for video . Erika Murray, 31, who is believed to be the mother of all seven children, was arraigned on Friday for charges relating to the foul living conditions, however no criminal charges have been filed in connection with the deaths of the three babies found at the Massachusetts home . Murray's attorney said that her client is mentally ill. A not guilty plea was entered on her behalf today during her arraignment at Uxbridge District Court . The judge agreed to a request by a prosecutor to seal a file concerning a previous court appearance on reckless endangerment charges related to the two youngest of the four children taken from the home last month. Murray's lawyer, Keith Halpern, pointing to the conditions in the home, suggested that his client was mentally ill. She was held without bail, NECN reported and is due back in court on October 14. Detectives investigating a case of reckless endangerment of children found the bodies on Thursday at the house in Blackstone, about 50 miles southwest of Boston along the Rhode Island border. Four other children had been removed from the home two weeks earlier. Erika Murray, 31, who is believed to be the mother of all seven children, was arrested on charges relating to the foul living conditions, however no criminal charges have been filed in connection with the deaths. Worcester District Attorney Joseph Early Jr. said the house was in 'deplorable condition.' He said authorities don't know when or how the babies died, or their ages and genders. The body of one infant was found inside a closet, police said. The two other babies were found on Thursday. Murray is led out of the district court in Uxbridge, Massachusetts following her arraignment on Friday. She is being held without bail and is due back in court on October 14 . The infants were found dead inside the home in Blackstone, Massachusetts on Thursday where four children were removed by authorities last month . Prosecutors said Murray, 31, would be arraigned on Friday on charges including intimidation of a witness. It was not immediately known whether she had an attorney. A spokesman for the Blackstone Police Chief  told the Boston Globe today that Murray is believed to be the mother of all seven children. The search of the home, which is just a couple hundred feet away from the town's police station, is expected to take several days. The four other children, ages 13, ten, three and six months old, were removed from the house on August 28 after a neighbor notified police about their living conditions. The prosecutor said one of them approached a neighbor about a child who wouldn't stop crying. Early said the six-month-old was found covered with feces lying on a bed. Both 'condemned' and 'keep out' signs are attached behind police tape to the front door of a house where a Massachusetts prosecutor said the bodies of three infants were found Thursday in Blackstone . Emergency personal in protective clothing fold a tarp on the street in front of a house where a Massachusetts prosecutor said the bodies of three infants were found . Investigators working in the small house were wearing hazardous material suits. 'The house is filled with vermin,' the prosecutor said. 'We have flies. We have bugs. We have used diapers, in some areas, as much as a foot-and-a-half to 2-feet high.' Marilynn Soucy, 68, who lives a few doors down, said she was still in shock at the news in the neighborhood where she has lived for 35 years. 'I am so disgusted. It hasn't really registered in my head yet,' she said. 'My husband and I raised seven children. We have 11 grandchildren and two great grandchildren. I cannot imagine hurting a child.' She said she and her husband, Bob, had rarely seen the couple who lived in the house for at least three years, or their children. She said they occasionally saw the 10-year-old, a boy, playing outside or the woman sit on her porch. Soucy said she never heard any major complaints about the couple, other than her grandkids noted once that the house smelled bad. Police investigators work outside a home after they discovered the remains of three infants inside a home filled with bugs and trash including dirty diapers piled several feet high, in Blackstone, Massachusetts . An official described the interior of the home crawling with vermin, swarming with flies and covered in dirty diapers . The house, Soucy said, had been renovated extensively before they moved in. 'If we thought kids were being abused or living in squalor we would have said something,' she said. Soucy said the only time there was commotion at the house was when officials removed the children. The state Department of Children and Families said in a statement Thursday that the children who were living at the home are in state custody. It said the department did not have a case involving the family and that it learned about the situation through a report of possible abuse or neglect. Early said it's too soon to know if charges will be filed in the infants' deaths, or against whom, because investigators don't even know who was living at the home when they died. It wasn't immediately clear where the children's parents were. Officers on the scene have found swarms of flies, bugs, vermin and 'piles of used diapers as much as a foot or two high'. Four other children, aged six months, three, ten and 13 years old, were removed from the house last month after a neighbor who discovered their living conditions notified police. He said the six-month-old baby was found covered in feces lying on a bed. The State Department of Children and Families said on Thursday that the children who were living at the home are now in state custody. On Thursday, 31-year-old Erika Murray was arrested in connection with the appalling living condition but not over the children's deaths. Murray is facing several charges, including witness intimidation. She will be arraigned on Friday.","Erika Murray arrested after the bodies of three infants were found at her Massachusetts home .

"A medical professional has insisted states in Australia  take immediate action to ban tanning beds in a bid to slash cancer rates. Written in a letter, the president for the Australian Medical Association Dr Michael Gannon said Western Australia was 'embarrassingly' falling behind other states who are banning the cancer causing beds from January 1 2015. He said solariums 'do not have a positive role in our society' and should therefore be banned. A medical professional has insisted states in Australia take immediate action to ban tanning beds in a bid to slash cancer rates . Dr Gannon criticises the Western Australian Health Minister Kim Hames, labelling her leadership as lacking and  said it is 'inexcusable' when it comes to such an important issue. He said once solarium tanning is banned in all other states Western Australia could be seen as a 'solarium tourism' destination for regular tanners. Opposition health spokesman Roger Cook agreed with Dr Gannon's letter stating the Western Australian government has failed to combat an issue that if passed could lead to a reduction in skin cancer diagnosis. Written in a letter, the president for the Australian Medical Association Dr Michael Gannon said solariums 'do not have a positive role in our society' and should therefore be banned . 'The Barnett Government has fundamentally failed to provide leadership on the issue of banning sunbeds,' Mr Cook said. 'The letter is a sign of desperation from the medical community.' Dr Gannon said tanning beds 'deliver six times the radiation of the midday sun' and show a clear link to 'skin cancer and death from skin cancer.' 'We have got a Minister who says they should be banned and yet we are lagging behind the rest of the country.' The letter comes as WA's Labor government has vowed to introduce laws to ban solariums from January 1. But banning tanning beds are not as easy as it seems with fears it could lead to unregulated home use. 'There is going to be a lot of people who will either be buying their own or looking for a friend of a friend who has got one. That's a real worry because they won't be trained,' a Perth solarium owner told perthnow.com.au.

"Victims are to get the legal right to confront offenders in court over the devastating impact of their crimes. Justice Secretary Chris Grayling is bringing in a law to replace an existing code of conduct that has failed to give enough victims a say in court. It will also require state-funded barristers to undergo specialist training before taking on rape cases or others involving serious sexual offences over concerns that the prospect of a gruelling cross-examination dissuades many women from pursuing rape cases. Justice Secretary Chris Grayling, pictured, is bringing in a law to replace an existing code of conduct that has failed to give enough victims a say in court . At present, just 18 per cent of reported rapes result in a suspect being charged. Mr Grayling said the package of reforms, which also include the creation of a new Victims’ Information Service, would ensure the ‘highest emphasis’ was placed on the needs of victims. Labour accused Mr Grayling of doing a U-turn after resisting their calls for a law on victims’ rights. Justice spokesman Sadiq Khan claimed ministers had let victims down. He said: ‘This announcement looks like it’s been cobbled together on the back of an envelope in the dying months of this Government.’ But Mr Grayling claimed the time had come to place greater emphasis on the needs of victims in the justice system. He added: ‘Our criminal justice system can be daunting, and victims – especially the most vulnerable – can find it traumatic and difficult to know where to turn to for advice and support. ‘We will create a system that puts the highest emphasis on victims’ needs and sets out their rights clearly in legislation.’ Victims’ Commissioner Baroness Newlove (pictured) has welcomed the changes but said the Government needed to go further . Victims’ Commissioner Baroness Newlove welcomed the changes but said the Government needed to go further. She questioned how the plans would have helped the hundreds of victims of the Rotherham child sexual exploitation scandal who were ignored by the authorities for years. ‘It’s good to see they are listening to what victims need but I do want to know how and when their promises will be delivered,’ she said. ‘A new law cannot be used as a quick fix but it must be delivered properly and with teeth. 'I want to see how it will be better than the existing Victims’ Code and how it will ensure that victims are treated with dignity and respect. Devastated: Geraldine and Peter McGinty . The parents of a murder victim were devastated after a parole hearing judge said impact statements ‘made no difference’. Geraldine and Peter McGinty, pictured left, heard Judge Graham White’s comments when a video link was accidentally left open during a recent hearing. The judge, who later apologised for his ‘private’ remarks, had heard from the couple when the court was deciding whether one of the killers of their son, Colin, 21, from Formby, Merseyside – who was stabbed to death in 2001 – should be allowed to move to an open prison. 'We’ve seen how the abuse of victims in Rotherham was covered up in such appalling ways. We heard how victims were treated with such prejudice that they were not believed by those who were there to protect them. ‘I’d like to know how a law would put a stop to this dismissive, ignorant and collusive behaviour.’ The decision to make state-funded barristers undergo training before handling serious sex cases follows the suicide of concert violinist Frances Andrade. She took an overdose a week after being subjected to a tough cross-examination by the lawyer for the former music teacher who abused her. At an inquest this year in Woking, Surrey, coroner Richard Travers criticised the authorities for failing to give her enough support. The hearing was told how Mrs Andrade fell into a spiral of despair after giving evidence in the trial.","Victims to get legal right to confront offenders in court over impact of crime .

"Sam Allardyce is fearful of his West Ham side being on the receiving end of a Manchester United backlash. The Hammers travel to Old Trafford on Saturday in good heart following a 3-1 home win over Liverpool last weekend - while United continue to struggle for consistency despite Louis van Gaal's summer spending spree. Many will still see the hosts as favourites going into the game but their vulnerabilities in defence were highlighted once again as they let a two-goal lead slip to lose 5-3 at Leicester on Sunday afternoon. Sam Allardyce fears West Ham will receive a Man United backlash after their defeat to Leicester . But that result, Allardyce fears, could see the likes of Radamel Falcao, Angel Di Maria and Wayne Rooney in no mood for a similar outcome against his side as they look to replicate their last home outing - a comfortable 4-0 victory over QPR. 'No. I'm thinking a backlash,' he said when asked if it was a good time to face van Gaal's side. 'I think that because of the determination of the Man United players and the fact they are playing at Old Trafford. Wayne Rooney and Radamel Falcao could combine together to cause West Ham problems . 'I know there's quite a lot of new players playing there but certainly the demand of Manchester United is huge and they'll be really fired up to make sure that they try and perform like they did against QPR and beat us. 'They will be pretty down about that performance they gave at Leicester and they will be hurting and they know the only way they can put that right is to get out onto the field and punish us for it - so we will have to be careful about that. 'A draw would be great for me, anything more than a draw would be outstanding as far as I'm concerned. 'They (the West Ham players) have got to look forward to a tough game at Old Trafford now and test their skills and test their ability at a stadium that can obviously be daunting for some players. 'Hopefully our new players won't be daunted about the prospect of playing at Old Trafford on Saturday.' Allardyce sympathised with Van Gaal's problems with seamlessly integrating his new recruits into the set-up at Old Trafford. Manchester United record signing Angel di Maria will be looking impress again at Old Trafford . West Ham themselves have brought in nine new faces since the end of last season and Allardyce insists getting so many new players to gel is not an easy task for anyone. 'It's not an excuse, it is an actual fact,' he said. 'If you've got your players to settle quicker then that is a bonus when you have brought in as many players as I have and as many players as Man United have. 'Irrespective of the talent, you've got to work as a team and to do that you need to understand each other - you need time. 'You can't just walk into a club for two days and say 'I know his strengths and weaknesses, I know his talent'.' The Hammers travel to Manchester without one of his additions, as midfielder Cheikhou Kouyate will miss up to six weeks with a groin injury - something Allardyce described as a 'blow'. Captain Kevin Nolan has returned to training but will not feature at Old Trafford whereas another option, Ravel Morrison, has been loaned out to Sky Bet Championship side Cardiff.

"Police have offered to protect the 15-year-old bailed on suspision of starting the blaze at Manchester Dogs' home . A 15-year-old bailed on suspicion of torching Manchester Dogs' Home has been urged to move by police after being bombarded with death threats. Police have offered to protect the teenager and his family amid growing concerns that they might be targeted in vigilante attacks following the blaze that claimed the lives of 60 animals. As outrage grew over the suspected arson attack on Thursday night, the boy was named and pictured on Twitter and the threats began to pour in. But the boy's defiant mother, 49, insisted they would not be forced out and said all the allegations were a 'pack of lies'. She said: 'They have said that he has had to move away, that the police told him to go away for his own safety but as you can see he is still here. I don't care what people are saying about threats. 'I am still here and I'm not leaving. I don't want to talk about it because people will twist everything we say.' It is not yet known whether the family have decided to leave the area for their own safety. But it has been revealed that the 15-year-old was attacked by a dangerously out-of-control Rhodesian ridgeback earlier this year. He suffered serious injuries to his left arm in the attack and had to be treated in hospital. A courageous neighbour used a kitchen knife to kill the dog and the owner was later prosecuted for allowing it to become out of control. Police sources say the teenager vehemently denies setting fire to the kennels in Harpurhey on Thursday night. It is understood he had to be restrained by police officers when he struggled with police in the cells while he was in custody. The fire tore through the dog's home, killing more than 60 animals as hundreds of others yelped in their cages . He is due to return to a police station on Monday. The youth is one of a handful police suspect may have played a role in the fire. Senior officers have instigated a 'safeguarding plan' for the families of the suspect and other boys who are being questioned about the fire. It could lead to those families being moved out of Harpurhey if they decide they want to leave the area. The blaze destroyed much of the complex as fire crews and local people managed to rescue around 150 of the dogs, which had been locked into their kennels for the night. More than £1.37million has now been donated to help rebuild the kennels. Police are thought to be concerned that assumptions have been made on the internet about a minor who may never be charged. An aerial view shows the devastation caused by the fire on Thursday  when the dog's home was set alight . Some of the social media messages highlighted an alleged connection between Thursday's blaze and the earlier dog attack. The teenager was attacked by a Rhodesian ridgeback earlier this year (file image above) One person wrote: 'Was attacked by a dog… so thought it was ok to set Manchester Dogs' Home alight and murder 50+ dogs.' Lisa Graham, manager of the stricken dogs' home, appealed for calm and for the police to be left to do their jobs. 'We don't want vigilantism,' she said. 'It's not going to do any good. We want to see justice, but for people to make death threats just isn't on.' Three local men have been hailed as heroes after defying the flames to rescue animals during the blaze. Jason Dyer, 41, his son, Daniel Vere, 25, and nephew, Dean Rostock, 25, dragged about 20 dogs to safety between them, despite the danger. In an outpouring of emotion across Britain, well-wishers have given £1.37million as well as donating  food, beds, and treats. 'We're going to have to rebuild, and that will be done on this site,' said Ms Graham. 'The kennels that burnt down were built in the 1980s, and since then there have been massive improvements in research and medical treatments.' A vigil for the dogs that died in the fire will be held at the local Christ Church at 6pm tonight. A couple set off to make a donation to survivors of the Manchester Dogs' Home fire yesterday – and ended up taking one of them home. Company director Rick Yates, 31, and his girlfriend Chelsea Bond, 28, a solicitor, were moved almost to tears when they saw the tragedy unfold on television. Yesterday they travelled to the kennels' sister home in Cheshire, determined to make a donation. But then they saw Elsie, a ten-year-old mongrel, and couldn't resist her. Elsie had been lucky to survive the blaze after being moved from the worst-affected area the previous day. 'It was love at first sight,' said Mr Yates, of Newton-le-Willows, Merseyside. 'The plan was to give her a temporary home. But we're hoping it can become permanent as she seems such a lovely dog.' The couple were among hundreds who turned out to the nearby Cheshire Dogs' Home in Grappenhall, near Warrington, to bring donations or offer to rehouse some of the survivors. So many converged on the site that at one stage the nearby M6 was gridlocked. Chelsea Bond and Rick Yates took Elsie home after visiting the kennel's sister home in Cheshire which is housing survivors of the tragedy .

"Swansea boss Garry Monk says Wayne Routledge deserves his new contract after finding a home at the Liberty Stadium. Routledge represented eight different clubs before joining Swansea in August 2011 and has since played a big part in the Welsh club establishing itself in the Barclays Premier League as well as winning the Capital One Cup in 2013. The 29-year-old winger has signed an extended one-year deal which will keep him at Swansea until 2018. Winger Wayne Routledge has signed a new contract at Swansea City until 2018 . 'He thoroughly deserves it because of his commitment to his club and how he's been,' said Monk, speaking ahead of Saturday's Barclays Premier League trip to Sunderland. 'He's found a home, somewhere he can be himself and bring out the player we now see week in week out. 'He's an experienced professional and what he brings to the squad is very valuable. 'He's been around at a lot of top clubs and seen a lot of things, but he has to trust you first before he opens up. 'He'll admit himself, a little bit he rebelled at times as a youngster but I think he never clicked at clubs where he felt he could express himself. 'Perhaps he was unsure of what he was capable of, but here he's had that freedom and guidance to be better. 'He does extras in training, he wants to improve all the time and it's great to have him here.' Swansea head to the Stadium of Light on the back of successive league defeats to Chelsea and Southampton after opening up with three straight wins. Swans manager Garry Monk says the new deal is thoroughly deserved for the 29-year-old . But Swansea bounced back with a comprehensive 3-0 victory over Everton in the Capital One Cup in midweek, the club's first-ever victory over the Merseysiders. 'The morale hadn't gone, the boys are fine,' Monk said. 'They are at the same level as they were at the start of the season and every game because of the way we've performed. 'Wins give you momentum and it's nice to go into the next game with a win behind you, but we're not concentrating on that. 'We're looking at performance levels every day and in games which have been there every time.' Monk has Wilfried Bony available again after last season's 25-goal marksman served his one-match suspension for being sent off against Southampton last weekend in midweek. Bony has yet to score this season but Monk has faith the Ivory Coast forward will soon be on the scoresheet. 'I don't put pressure on players, it's about the contribution,' Monk said. 'It's good the goals are spread out. It's good for strikers to score, but we don't need to put pressure on. 'They're good characters and it won't be long before they're scoring again.'","Swansea have tied Wayne Routledge down to a new deal .

"Roberto Martinez has urged Everton’s players to rewrite history and end an Anfield hoodoo that stretches back 15 years. Everton’s last away victory against Liverpool came on September 27, 1999 when a goal from Kevin Campbell settled a bad-tempered clash in which three red cards were shown. Martinez’s first venture across Stanley Park as Everton manager ended in misery in January, as Liverpool ran out convincing 4-0 winners, but the Spaniard is not daunted by statistics. Roberto Martinez wants his Everton players to rewrite history in their Saturday match against Liverpool . Roberto Martinez is eager to pounce in their Premier League clash against Liverpool at Anfield on Saturday . Samuel Eto'o and Co will travel to Liverpool in the hope of snatching three points at the famous Anfield stadium . Having masterminded Everton’s first win away to Manchester United in 22 years, Martinez does not see a reason why history should be a burden to this group and believes the game offers a prime opportunity to kickstart their season. Martinez said: ‘The last time we beat Liverpool at Anfield was September 27, so let’s hope it’s the same. When we lost 3-2 to Crystal Palace, I said it was a bit spooky. It was 3-2, they had three shots on target and there was three mistakes (like last season). So let’s hope this one is as well. ‘It affects us in a positive way in my eyes because stats are there to be broken. It’s a difficult place to go but there are many others too and we have gone and changed the stats and history. I look forward to that – it’s an extra bit of motivation.’ If Everton are to do that, though, they will have to defend better than they have done this season. Mistakes have compromised Everton’s ambitions to build on last year’s fifth placed finish and they conceded six times in their last two matches. The manager recognises the need to improve is immediate but he will not check his natural instincts to set up his team to attack. Martinez feels this will be an open and entertaining game. Everton striker Francis Jeffers and Liverpool goalkeeper Sander Westerveld square up in the 1999 clash . ‘It has been an area that we have been quite poor and we need to improve,’ Martinez admitted. ‘We need to fine tune. You sometimes have areas where you are so good that you might take it for granted. You look at the experience we have in the team. It is just making sure the focus needs to be better. ‘That is clearly an area that we need to resolve. It is affecting scorelines. I think performances have been better than last season but we need to improve. We are a confident side. We want to make sure we get more focused, better communication and face the challenge to get back to the standards of last season. ‘We don’t want to accept the amount of goals we have conceded. We don’t want to be a team that concedes cheaply. I don’t think it is in the nature of the two sides. We want to impose ourselves on the game. The city wants two teams that will grow and get better. We want to become as good as we can.’ Meanwhile, Martinez has revealed that Ross Barkley is ready to step up his rehabilitation from knee ligament damage next week when he starts running. He would not, though, discuss stories linking the England midfielder with a move to Manchester City next summer. ‘I don’t think it is anything to comment about,’ said Martinez. ‘It is a rumour and we will leave it there. We take it as a footballing compliment and move on.’ James McCarthy reacts after Everton's 3-2 defeat against Crystal Palace in their Premier League clash .","Everton’s last away win against Liverpool came on September 27, 1999 .

"Click here . What do you say to an AC Milan fan after his idols have won the Champions League final? 'Switch off the PlayStation, you've got work in the morning.' The gag may be naff, but illustrates their decline succinctly, even if they are restoring pride under new coach Pippo Inzaghi. The Rossoneri are not in Europe this season. Not even the Europa League. Rival supporters in Italy find it hilarious, but many outside the peninsular consider UEFA competitions incomplete without the seven-times European champions. British football fans over 25 hold fond memories of them thanks to Channel 4. When calcio viewership was at its UK peak in the early-to-mid-Nineties, Milan ruled, winning won four league titles between 1991-92 and 1995-96. Ruud Gullit, Frank Rijkaard, Zvonimir Boban, Franco Baresi and Paolo Maldini? Yes please. AC Milan ruled in the 1990s, Frank Rijkaard and Ruud Gullit were at the forefront of the success . AC Milan posses many Italian national team legends too, particularly in Paolo Maldini (left) and Franco Baresi . Since the turn of the century they have had entertaining tussles with Manchester United, Leeds, Celtic and Chelsea. And a couple of big nights with Liverpool. Then the slide. Two incidents reveal everything. In October 1999 Chelsea's travelling support were elated with a 1-1 draw against Milan at the San Siro in the Champions League. A decade and a half later, promising Blues reserve Marco van Ginkel needed persuading to join the Italians on loan. What caused such a monumental tumble? Milan are now in a period where they have to borrow players off teams like Chelsea, including Marco Van Ginkel . Cost Cutters . Cash played a part in the downsizing of this giant, though not to the extent often reported. Fininvest, Milan's parent company, founded by club president Silvio Berlusconi, suffered losses earlier this decade. In the most remarkable clear-out in recent memory, the Rossoneri sold or released a slew of high earners in 2012-13's transfer windows. World Cup 2006 heroes Alessandro Nesta,  Inzaghi, Gianluca Zambrotta, Massimo Oddo and Gennaro Gattuso moved on. Champions League winners Seedorf and Mark van Bommel left, crown jewels Zlatan Ibrahimovic and Thiago Silva flew to PSG, enraging fans in the process. Devilish forward Antonio Cassano concluded the summer exodus and popular but fragile Brazil striker Pato departed in January 2013. Zlatan Ibrahimovic was a San Siro hero but was sold on to PSG for a large transfer fee . Massimiliano Allegri was tasked with leading Milan through a difficult financial period . Allegri, an understated, co-operative man, led an Ibra-inspired team to the 2011 championship. Two years later he guided his men to third place, despite the evacuation of talent. He never moaned. But the declining Rossoneri were less of a draw for fans in the stadium and on the sofa. In January 2014 a Milan XI of bargain bucket players, prospects, misfits and veterans lost 4-3 to Sassuolo in the league. Allegri, suffocating in the toxic gloom, was dismissed. Spirits and performances were at their lowest since the club's humiliating relegation from Serie A in 1982. But budget cutting isn't the full story. Finance expert Andrea Bricchi covers economics for the website 'PianetaMilan' (Milan Planet). 'Berlusconi is still Italy's richest man. He could still spend €300m a year on transfers, but his political advisers forbid it. In this era of austerity it would look frivolous and wasteful,' says Bricchi. David Beckham is one of many players who joined the club on a short-term deal . Berlusconi's inner circle is attuned to the political power of football. 'His aides advise him to splash out during electoral campaigns. Milan bought Ibrahimovic, Robinho and Mario Balotelli before recent elections. But they won't let Berlusconi sell the team or spend heavily too often. Both would lose public favour and votes,' adds Bricchi. The Lombardy club are marketing pacesetters in calcio. Their flashy, multilingual website (ACMilan.com) and glossy club promotions are everything you'd expect from a team owned by Berlusconi - a master communicator who made his fortune from television. But merchandising revenue in Italian football is low compared with La Liga and the Premier League. Although they have won only three fewer European Cups/Champions Leagues than Real Madrid, Milan's shirt sales are miles behind the aristocratic Spaniards' figures. Richard Smith of leading kit sellers Subsidesports.com says: 'There's a correlation in results, players and sales. Mario Balotelli and Stephan El Shaarawy jerseys sold well last season, but like most Italian teams, Milan are a tenth of where they were commercially in the 90s or early 00s.' Silvio Berlusconi could spend heavily in the transfer market but 'political advisors forbid it' Rossoneri Revival . The frugal life, forced or not, has made club directors resourceful. This summer's transfer activity was extraordinary for such a prestigious team. Milan's net expenditure was -£13.2m. The sale of Balotelli to Liverpool was the largest event. The club broke the transfer world record twice in the summer of 1992, when they bought Jean-Pierre Papin then Gianluigi Lentini. Now they are leaders in employing out of contract or unwanted stars. Several players expected to be protagonists this season cost nothing. They include mercurial winger Jeremy Menez, Japanese icon Keisuke Honda, former Real Madrid goalkeeper Diego Lopez and unpredictable but committed midfielder Sulley Muntari. Mario Balotelli was the latest star to leave Milan this summer, joining Liverpool for just £16m . But Fernando Torres has started well at the San Siro, scoring on his full debut against Empoli on Tuesday . Then there's hulking ex-Chelsea centre back Alex, club captain Riccardo Montolivo and Fernando Torres, who headed his first goal in Italy away to Empoli on Tuesday night. These players, not to mention wobbly defender Philippe Mexes and Michael Essien, cost less than a ticket to the city's famous opera house La Scala. Supporters aren't rejoicing that their team is scrounging and scrabbling around for players. But it's difficult not to admire such creative, canny dealing. And don't assume that freebies are a new concept at the San Siro. Michael Reizeger, Edgar Davids, Cafu, Jon Dahl Tomasson, Rivaldo and Mark van Bommel arrived for nothing in the past. But the volume of zero cost re-enforcements has never been this high. Value for money includes the dugout. The last three coaches, Allegri, Seedorf and current boss Inzaghi, have been inexpensive. For all their qualities, they won't trouble 'world's 20 best paid managers' lists. Filippo Inzaghi has switched being a poacher in the penalty area for watching on from the coaching area . Is the quest for success via financial sustainability bad for the image of the former glamour boys of calcio? Stefano Cantalupi of Gazzetta dello Sport says: 'Recruiting cheap options runs the risk of damaging the brand globally. But they are clever to hire coaches like Seedorf and Inzaghi who won the Champions League with the club in recent years. The link to the ""glory days"" remains.' Match day revenue is equally problematic. The club are synonymous with the world famous San Siro, which resembles a futuristic car park. But they don't own the ground and can't generate the money they'd like. They want their own home with official merchandise outlets, restaurants and better facilities for fans. The plan is to leave the San Siro in the next three years. CEO Barbara Berlusconi said: 'Our own stadium would allow us to compete with Europe's more economically powerful clubs. It's a priority.' CEO Barbara Berlusconi insists Milan can compete with the heavyweights again at the San Siro (pictured) So Far, So Good . Fans don't obsess over spreadsheets. What happens on the pitch counts. The new look, low cost Milan and their young leader Inzaghi started well. They were slick and hungry in their opening day 3-1 victory over Lazio and impressed (in attack) in their next outing, a 5-4 win at Parma. A cautious, passive defeat at home by champions Juventus on Saturday showed how much work is required. In their latest match, a midweek trip to Empoli, the defence looked panicky. But the way they fought back from 2-0 after twenty one minutes to draw 2-2 showed character. The enthusiasm remains. On a good day, Inzaghi's side play bold, fast football, moving the ball quickly and taking a maximum of two touches. Snappy, short passes to feet and a low line to leave space for the forwards to zoom into. AC Milan's new era isn't the most expensive, but they are sure to entertain in Serie A this season . Massimo Callegari presents live Serie A games on Mediaset, and spoke to Inzaghi after Milan's opening win over Lazio. 'The message from Inzaghi is that they'll tolerate the occasional defeat if the other team are clearly better than them. But it's unacceptable if Milan fail because they show less hunger and dedication than the other side. He is creating a strong, close-knit group,' says Callegari. The recent past is ugly, the distant past a permanent reminder of the Rossoneri's decline. This motivated, united squad and their energetic coach are worth watching though. The 13-time Scudetto winners, free of European commitments, shouldn't be underestimated. If they keep up the high-scoring (10 goals scored, eight conceded in four league games) fans won't need PlayStations for entertainment.","AC Milan ruled in the 1990s with several of the world's biggest stars .

"Rangers boss Ally McCoist has welcomed the absence of an Old Firm clash from the League Cup quarter-final - because he reckons the hype would have disrupted his team’s focus in their quest for Championship points. The stage was set for what would have been the first Celtic-Rangers game in two-and-a-half years at this week’s last-eight draw, but instead Rangers were paired with St Johnstone at Ibrox next month while Ronny Deila’s men were handed a Glasgow derby with Partick Thistle at Parkhead. McCoist, for his part, declared himself somewhat relieved that The Big One didn’t come to pass, fearing that a month of frenzied anticipation in the build-up to the match would have distracted his players from the challenge of overhauling Hearts at the top of the league. Rangers boss Ally McCoist admitted he was relieved his side didn't draw Celtic in the League Cup . ‘We certainly weren’t pining for an Old Firm game although we would have taken whoever the cup draw gave us,’ said McCoist. ‘It’s going to be a tough game against St Johnstone. But it’s one which can hopefully be put on the back burner a little bit. ‘We’ll certainly be doing that because we’ve got some tough league games to concentrate on before we concentrate our thoughts on the League Cup again. ‘We said if we could get a home tie we would take it and we’ve got that against a side which, on its day, is capable of giving anybody a game. ‘St Johnstone are a really solid, hard-working team, who ended up winning the Scottish Cup quite comfortably last season. ‘As much as we’re pleased with the draw, we’re certainly not underestimating the task ahead of us.’ McCoist (left) is enjoying the cup run but his priority is  getting Rangers promoted to the Scottish Premiership . Dean Shiels scored Rangers' second on Tuesday in the 3-1 League Cup win against Falkirk . Ibrox defender Bilel Mohsni, meanwhile, insisted that St Johnstone are the ideal opponents for Rangers in their bid to make the last four as he expects them to play a more open game than the teams he’s encountered on the way up the divisions. Last weekend’s 1-1 league draw on the plastic pitch at part-timer Alloa was a classic example of the Ibrox men being bustled and hustled out of their stride. Now Mohsni says he can’t wait for a more free-flowing game against Saints - who Rangers last met in their final game in the old SPL in May 2012 - and believes it will bring out the best in his team as they seek their first major trophy in a knockout compeition since the 2011 League Cup final victory over Celtic. Rangers defender Bilel Mohsni (right) believes St Johnstone are ideal League Cup quarter-final opponents . ‘Last season we were beaten in the first round but now we are in the quarter-finals and it would be good to go further if we can,’ the Tunisian international told Rangers.co.uk . ‘We have shown we can beat anyone so we will feel confident we can do well against St Johnstone - but they are a good team. ‘They will play football and we are at home so I think those factors combined are good for us. ‘When we play sides who try to play properly, we can show we can do exactly the same and I think it will suit us to play St Johnstone. Next up for Ally McCoist's side in the League Cup is holders St Johnstone who beat Kilmarnock on Tuesday . ‘It will be a good game to watch and hopefully we can do well. Everyone wants to win trophies. Last season we nearly got there and hopefully we can do it this season. ‘It’s most important to win the league and to get promoted but we are still in all three cups so it would be good to win one of them. ‘This is a massive club. We know how many trophies it has won and people expect us to keep delivering. It would be fantastic to do that.’ Despite his side being a league above Rangers, St Johnstone boss Tommy Wright believes all the expectation will be on McCoist’s men. Rangers midfielder Lewis Macleod (right) injured himself last weekend but should be back for Monday's clash with Hibernian . ‘It’s a great draw for us because there is no pressure on us,’ said Wright. ‘It’s a massive club against a little club. ‘Rangers are doing really well at the moment and have already beaten Inverness and Falkirk in the competition. ‘They have regained their form in the league after the early setback against Hearts so they are a team that’s used to winning. ‘I have seen them a couple of times and I think their improvement is down to the fact they are challenged more in the Championship and their players are responding to that. If you look at the squad they have it is one that could probably compete in the top league. ‘It will also be good for our players to go to Ibrox because players want to go and play huge clubs in front of big crowds and stadia that are world class. ‘We look at the draw and think we can beat anybody on our day. That’s how we will approach it. There is a lot of time between now and the quarter-final but we look forward to it.’ Old firm rivals Celtic beat Hearts 3-0 in the League Cup on Wednesday to book their place in the quarter-final .","Rangers drew St Johnstone at home in the League Cup quarter-final .

"Body found: Police said they found a body they think is Anna Marie Smith, 18, who disappeared earlier this month . A body has been found in the hunt for a female freshman who went missing just outside her campus days after telling her parents she'd been attacked. The remains of Anna Marie Smith, an 18-year-old student at Appalachian State University in Boone, North Carolina, were found in woodland near where she was last seen on the night of September 2. Police in Boone confirmed the discovery today, saying: 'Initial evidence indicates the deceased person found today is Anna Marie Smith'. They had been led to the inaccessible point, surrounded by trees and bushes, after a local reported a suspicious stench, according to the Charlotte Observer. Officers said they found a driver's license and university ID by the body, though they did not comment on how she might have died. During the early stages of the 10-day manhunt it emerged that Miss Smith had told her parents that she had been attacked days before her disappearance. She told her family that she had been at a party with around five other students on August 27, and had been attacked later that evening. She said she could not remember the incident well - and also could not think of a reason for the assault. Dan and Laurie Smith, Miss Smith's parents, mentioned the incident but did not provide full details because they said it may harm the police investigation. Officers added there was 'no evidence' for a sexual element to the attack. Miss Smith was last spotted by the driver of a free transit service which moves students around the town after dark. Manhunt: The body was reportedly tracked down after a local noticed an unusual smell coming from a densely wooded area near the Appalachian State university campus . Family: Laurie and Dan Smith, pictured above at a press conference, said that their daughter had told them about an assault just days before she disappeared . A woman called the Mountaineer SafeRide van from an events venue in the town to Mountaineer Hall, a student housing block on campus. She and friends then took the journey - though the bus driver reportedly told police she could not be certain the woman who got on board was Miss Smith. Mr Smith had headed to Appalachian State to visit his daughter that evening to bring her a laptop and cell phone which she had left at home in High Point, about 200 miles from Boone. Identification: Police say initial evidence suggests that the woman's body is that of Miss SMith . Crime scene: Police cordoned off an area in Boone near where the body was discovered this morning . He arrived at her dorm room on the evening of September 3, almost exactly as she was officially declared missing. She was reported missing the following day, sparking a huge search. Police, including dog units, and volunteers combed the area around the campus, but nothing had been found until this evening. The discovery was also confirmed by Sheri Everts, the chancellor of Appalachian State. She wrote: 'Our thoughts and deepest sympathy are with Anna’s family and loved ones during this very difficult time. Having one of our own missing struck the Appalachian community very hard, and this very sad news is heartbreaking for us all. 'The loss of Anna will continue to weigh heavy on our hearts... We had hoped so much that this search would end differently, yet all of these efforts underscore our belief in just how integral each of us is to this community.' Disappeared: Miss Smith had called for a bus to get her across campus on the evening of September 2, and had not been seen since . Discovery: Police said they found a university ID card and a driver's license with Miss Smith's name along with the body . Searches: Police, including dog units, as well as volunteers from campus and beyond had joined the 11-day search . 'Struck us hard': Sheri Everts, the Chancellor of Appalachian State, posted a message to students telling of their collective grief . There are plans for a memorial book to be set up on campus for students to share their memories of Miss Smith. Mourners began posting tributes and messages of condolence to a Facebook page set up to help co-ordinate her search. One said: 'There are no words to express the sadness that I felt when I read that she had been found. May God wrap his arms around you and hold you close during this difficult time.' Another added: 'Praying for your family during this very devastating time.'","Anna Marie Smith, 18, went missing from Boone, North Carolina, on September 2 .

"It was meant to be the happiest day of Katherine Marshall's life – the day she and her partner finally tied the knot. But the night before the Toowoomba couple's big day, Katherine received a phone call from her doctor that would leave her fighting for her life over the next two years. 'He rang me up on Friday night at my rehearsal dinner to confirm that I had Hodgkin lymphoma. I definitely had the s***s with him,' Katherine told Daily Mail Australia. Katherine Marshall found out she had a rare form of blood cancer the day before she married her partner Luke . Despite receiving the diagnosis at her rehearsal dinner while surrounded by 40 other guests, the 26-year-old said she simply didn't react to the news and that there was never any talk of cancelling the wedding . 'I just didn't react. I didn't want to walk in crying,' she said of the heart-breaking moment. 'I had 40 family members sitting in a restaurant and I just ducked out and was just standing on the stairs. I knew it was coming but I just hadn't believed it.' The 26-year-old, who was 24 when she learnt of her diagnosis, had been brushing off her symptoms for months, blaming them on her wedding-frenzy. 'I'd had itchy legs, night sweats and had lost heaps of weight. I just explained them away with different things,' Katherine said. 'The itchy legs I thought were was just dry legs from the warming weather, I was losing weight because of the wedding and the night sweats I just thought I was roasting myself with the heater at night. 'It was a week before the wedding that I noticed I had a lump on my neck, and I couldn't ignore that.' Katherine and her husband were forced to cancel their honeymoon and 'postpone' their lives while she underwent ten cycles of chemotherapy . The newly-wed said the treatment, which lasted for almost seven months, left her feeling like she'd been 'run-over by a semi-trailer'. She said: 'it was very hard to see the light at the end of the tunnel' Despite the shocking diagnosis, the bride-to-be said she chose to ignore the cancer on her wedding day, which still made its presence known in the form of a patch on her neck from a biopsy. Source: Leukaemia Foundation Australia . 'There was never any talk of cancelling the wedding,' she said. 'I didn't want anyone to treat me differently, I just wanted people to celebrate the day. I didn't want to remember my wedding day as the day after I realised I was really sick.' Although desperate not to cancel their honeymoon, Katherine's husband Luke soon convinced his bride to postpone their trip in order to start her chemotherapy as soon as possible. The couple were forced to 'postpone' their entire life while Katherine underwent ten cycles of treatment which lasted for almost seven months and left her feeling like she'd been 'run-over by a semi-trailer'. 'We thought we'd go on our honeymoon, progress in our careers, buy a house, have kids and do all those sorts of things in the next few years,' Katherine said. 'But we couldn't do any of that. I ended up finishing up work and had my treatment in Toowommba, but that didn't work so we had to move to Brisbane. Luke had to take time off work because the doctor said I needed a carer.' Two years later, Katherine is in remission and recovering slowly. She and Luke will finally have their honeymoon in November and hope to try their luck at having children in the next few years . 'The treatment was awful, it's very hard to describe. You feel like you've been smooshed by a truck. You just lay there feeling dead because obviously the chemo is killing you. 'It was very hard to see the light at the end of the tunnel.' Two years later however, Katherine is in remission and recovering slowly but surely. Katherine will also speak to other patients and carers about her experience as part of World Lymphoma Awareness Day . In November, she and Luke will finally have the honeymoon of their dreams during a moth long trip to Europe. They also hope to have their own children in the next few years despite the chemotherapy having destroyed Katherine's reproductive system, due to their doctor retrieving eight of her eggs which can be utilised through IVF procedures. Now 26-years-old, Katherine is partaking in World Lymphoma Awareness Day, when she will speak to other patients and there carers about her experience, to help them feel they are not alone.","Katherine Marshall was diagnosed with Hodgkin lymphoma the day before her wedding .

"Liverpool are expected to turn a near-£50million loss reported in 2013 into a profit last season - figures that the club are confident will mean they avoid any sanctions from UEFA for financial fair play (FFP) rule breaches. UEFA has announced that Liverpool are one of seven clubs who did not play in European competition last season who are under investigation for potential FFP breaches. Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers said the club were 'comfortable' with UEFA's action and it is understood the 2013-14 figures will show a profit when they are formally announced in the spring. That is a significant turnaround given that Liverpool made a loss of £49.8million for the 2012-13 season, and £40.5million for the 10-month period before that. Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers speaks to his players during training at Melwood on Thursday . UEFA's FFP rules dictate that losses must be restricted to £35.4million over a two-year window so ending the 2013-14 season in the black - thanks to a combination of the bumper new Premier League TV deal, commercial income increases and cost-cutting - will be a huge boost to efforts to avoid sanctions. The Merseyside club will also aim to write off a big chunk of losses as allowable stadium expenditure - the 2011-12 accounts reported that £49.6million was associated with Liverpool's stadium costs, £35million coming from former co-owner Tom Hick's aborted plan to build a new stadium on Stanley Park which current owners Fenway Sports Group had to scrap. UEFA announced that Liverpool, Monaco, Roma, Besiktas, Inter Milan, Krasnodar and Sporting Lisbon are all being subjected to investigations relating to 'potential break-even breaches'. Liverpool hope to write off a big chunk of losses last season as allowable stadium expenditure . Rodgers said: 'It's obviously something that will be dealt with by the directors. It's something we're comfortable with because we're great advocates of financial fair play. It's ongoing with the club.' UEFA will not withhold any Champions League or Europa League money from those clubs, but prize money has been held back from five clubs - Bursaspor, CFR Cluj, Astra Giurgiu, Buducnost Podgorica and Ekranas - as a result of 'over-due payables' - non-payments to other clubs, players and/or tax authortities. A UEFA statement read: 'The CFCB (club financial control body) has opened formal investigations into seven clubs as they disclosed a break-even deficit on the basis of their financial reporting periods ending in 2012 and 2013. A new bumper Premier League TV deal could help Liverpool avoid UEFA sanctions . 'These clubs will need to submit additional monitoring information during October and November upon the deadlines set by the CFCB, subsequent to which an additional communication shall be made and conservatory measures may be imposed.' Manchester City and Paris St Germain were the clubs hit hardest by UEFA last season for breaching FFP rules - they were each fined £49million and handed restrictions on transfer spending and a reduction in Champions League squad size. UEFA said the impact of FFP was showing positive results. Liverpool have invested heavily in the squad to tackle Premier League and Champions League commitments . The statement continued: 'The introduction of the UEFA club licensing and financial fair play regulations has already had a very positive impact on the scale of overdue payables, as they have decreased from 57 million euros in June 2011 to eight million euros in June 2014. 'In addition, aggregate losses reported by Europe's first-division clubs in the 2013 financial year have gone down to 800million euros from a record-reported deficit of 1.7 billion euros in 2011.'","Liverpool are one of seven clubs under investigation by UEFA .

"David Cameron is to warn there is 'no going back' if Scotland votes for independence in his last public appeal to keep the United Kingdom together. The Prime Minister will use a speech in Aberdeen tomorrow to warn a Yes vote will the Scotland and the rest of the UK 'go our separate ways forever'. His campaigning visit – his tenth to Scotland this year – comes after he spent yesterday considering a union of a different kind by attending a society wedding in Hampshire. Scroll down for video . David Cameron prepared for his final plea o keep the family of nations together by attending the society wedding in Hampshire of his wife's (pictured) half-brother, Jake Astor . Jake Astor, 33 (right with his bride Victoria) is the Old Etonian son of Viscount Astor and works as an investment analyst. The Prime Minister (left) attended the ceremony in Hampshire with his family . With four days to go until the historic referendum on Thursday, polls suggest the race is neck-and-neck. Mr Cameron has been mocked by Yes campaigners for not making more trips to Scotland, claiming the appearance of senior Tories north of the border bolster support for independence. But the Prime Minister will use his speech to Conservative activists in Aberdeen to set out a positive case for preserving the Union, and argue against using the referendum as a chance to punish Westminster parties. He is expected to say: 'This is a decision that could break up our family of nations and rip Scotland from the rest of the UK. 'And we must be very clear. There's no going back from this. No re-run. This is a once-and-for-all decision. 'If Scotland votes yes, the UK will split, and we will go our separate ways forever.' The latest Poll of Polls, compiled by political expert Professor John Curtice at WhatScotlandThinks.Com, puts the No campaign narrowly ahead on 51 per cent. It follows four new polls overnight, with only an ICM survey for the Sunday Telegraph giving the Yes campaign a lead, which based based on a smaller-than-normal sample of only 700 people . He will reject attempts by First Minister Alex Salmond to portray the choice as being one of 'whether Scotland is a nation'. Mr Cameron will say: 'Scotland is a proud, strong, successful nation. The vote on Thursday is about two competing visions for Scotland's future. 'The Nationalists' vision of narrowing down, going it alone, breaking all ties with the UK. 'Or the patriotic vision of a strong Scottish nation allied to the rest of the United Kingdom with its own stronger Scottish Parliament at its heart and with the benefits of UK co-operation on jobs, pensions, healthcare funding, the currency, interest rates.' Downing Street insiders said Mr Cameron had spent the weekend working on his speech. But he also found time to mingle with well-heeled guests in the Hampshire village of Northington, where Samantha's half-brother Jake Astor married Victoria Hargreaves. The younger son of Viscount Astor and his wife Annabel, 33-year-old Jake is an Old Etonian who studied at Oxford University and works as a Mandarin-speaking investment analyst, while his wife is a consultant for a luxury brand. The couple were thrown a pre-wedding reception in Downing Street two days ago, laid on by the Prime Minister's wife. They are part of the aristocratic Astor family, descended from the 19th Century fur trader and America's first multi-millionaire John Jacob Astor. Mr Cameron may have had the marriage in mind as he prepares to warn against the break-up of the 'family of nations'. First Minister Alex Salmond claimed that people saying they would vote against his dream of independence were 'only deferred ‘Yes’-es', as Better Together leader Alistair Darling insisted the No campaign was on course for victory. The two men appeared on the Andrew Marr Show, where Mr Salmond posed with a violin . The latest raft of opinion polls all point to differing results, but suggest the result is too close to call. A Panelbase survey for The Sunday Times put No on 50.6 per cent and Yes 49.4 per cent. A poll by Survation gave the No campaign an eight-point lead on 54 per cent to 46 per cent while an Opinium survey in The Observer put No on 53 per cent and Yes 47 per cent. However, a surprise ICM poll for the Sunday Telegraph put the Yes campaign eight points ahead, on 54 per cent, although it was based on a survey size of only 700 people. More than 4.2million people have registered to vote in the historic referendum which will decide the fate of the 307-year-old Union. Experts predict the turnout could be as high as 85 per cent. Better Together leader Alistair Darling insisted internal campaign research put them comfortably ahead, but he suggested half a million people in Scotland have not decided how to vote with opinion polls suggesting the race is neck and neck. First Minister Alex Salmond claimed that people saying they would vote against his dream of independence were 'only deferred ‘Yes’-es', as he faced claims he was embarking on a 'premature victory lap' with four days until the historic referendum.","Prime Minister to fly to Aberdeen to issue his final plea to preserve the Union .

"Everton defender John Stones is confident he will never forget his maiden European away match. Stones has experienced plenty of firsts in 2014 as his rapid rise to prominence continues, including starting a Barclays Premier League game early in the year and later going on to make his senior England debut. The 20-year-old is now getting a taste of a continental campaign with his club in what is their return to European action after four seasons of not being involved. John Stones featured in his first European away match in a hard fought 1-1 draw against Krasnodar . The 20-year-old has had a stellar year, making his England debut on 30 May in a 3-0 win against Peru . Another milestone was Stones' first England start in a friendly against Norway on 3 September . And his latest new experience came on Thursday night as the Toffees played their first away fixture of Europa League Group H. With the opponents being Russia's FK Krasnodar, the contest very much represented a journey into the unknown, even given the help Everton striker Samuel Eto'o and winger Aiden McGeady - both of whom have played in the country's premier division - tried to provide for their team-mates in the preparations. It turned out to be an extremely tricky fixture for the Merseysiders from which they just salvaged a 1-1 draw, their stand-out seasoned European campaigner Eto'o notching an equaliser in the 82nd minute. 1 January 2014 - Stones makes his first Premier League start in a 1-1 draw against Stoke. 30 May 2014 - Two days after his 20th birthday, the defender makes his senior England debut in a 3-0 win over Peru. 3 September 2014 - Roy Hodgson names Stones in his starting line-up for his first England start in a friendly against Norway. 2 October 2014 - Another first for the Everton man as he features in his maiden European away game in a 1-1 draw against Krasnodar. And reflecting upon the evening, Stones said: 'It is a big learning curve for me and one of these nights - you'll never forget the first one. 'It was hard - we don't get to see much of the Russian league, so we did our homework on them and got advice off Samuel and Aiden as much as we could. 'But you never really know until you get here and play them. It was pretty much a learning curve for us all. 'It is always hard when you are coming away to a such a hostile environment like here I suppose. 'It was very strange for us, something we are not used to.' Everton were second-best for much of the game and fell behind in the 43rd minute when Ari capitalised on an error by Phil Jagielka and fired home. Krasnodar created the bulk of the chances throughout and almost made it 2-0 in the second half when substitute Wanderson hit the bar. Although there were a number of moments of uncertainty at the back for the visitors, Stones put in a fairly impressive individual display. And he felt the team showed great character to snatch a 1-1 draw late on for a second successive match, having done the same in Saturday's Merseyside derby at Liverpool . Stones reflected on a 'hard' test against Krasnodar who finished fifth in the Russian Premier League last year . Veteran striker Samuel Eto'o wheels away after his late leveller for Everton at the Kuban Stadium . It was a tricky affair, but Roberto Martinez's men held on to snatch a Europa League draw in Russia . Stones said: 'I think it is a very good point that we got out of the game. 'It was a bit sloppy for the first goal, but I thought the character we showed to come back and score the equaliser was credit to ourselves. 'We dug in there and I thought we could even have had a few more. 'It shows there is great character in the dressing room.'","Stones' rapid rise to prominence has continued to impress .

"If weeping over a stationary bike sounds like every time you attempt a spinning class, the latest trend in fitness might confuse you somewhat. SoulCycle, which starting in New York, has gained an impressive list of celebrity followers which includes Tom Cruise, Lady Gaga, the entire Beckham clan and Katy Perry, and is now heading across the pond. It essentially is a mixture of the hard-core aerobic workouts sent to ear-splitting loud chart tunes –making the class seem more like a club than gym- and a therapy session. Scroll down for video . A SoulCylce class, pictured in full swing, combines high intensity cardio with therapeutic encouragement . Super model Alessandra Ambrosio smiles as she leaves a SoulCycle class in Santa Monica in July . Victoria Beckham and Tana Ramsay ventured out for a SoulCycle class in LA in matching slogan T-shirts . Actress Emmy Rossum showed her devotion to SoulCycle by heading out after a class in the brand's edgy patterned leggings on her 28th birthday . SoulCylcle’s hyper-intensive formula which has been inspiring exercise fanatics since 2006 with party atmosphere classes that fuse mind and body into a heart-pumping, addictive workout routine. The instructor will talk you through emotions such as sadness and anger in between adjusting the pace and incline of your workout, a formula which reportedly sees people crying over their bikes on a regular basis. The fitness fad is set to come to London within the next year, and the classes – which take up to sixty students- are certain to book up fast as the capital's lycra-clad elite are wooed by SoulCycle’s heady promise of combined workout and therapy session. Speaking to the Observer, SoulCycle’s marketing director said: ‘We’re planning on London in the next year, We really try to have more than one studio when we open.’ The classes have reached a crazed level of devotion in recent years as stars like Lady Gaga, Bradley Cooper, Jake Gyllenhaal and Charlize Theron regularly pop in to the New York and LA studios. Super model Karlie Kloss, who works out four to five times a week, fuels her body with green juices, admitted last year that SoulCycle was a challenge for her and that her instructor even berates her in front of the class for it. The Chicago-born model, who credits her famous SoulCycle instructor Akin for really 'pushing' her, and told Style.com: ‘I always tend to be one beat off of the rest of the class and the instructor usually calls me out on it in front of everyone.’ Fans of SoulCyle include Victoria's Secret model Elsa Hosk (left) and David Beckham (right) Super model Karlie Kloss credits her famous SoulCycle instructor Akin for really 'pushing' her .

SoulCycle spin sessions have become a hit among young girls in the area who attend the studio's SoulTeen classes that cater specifically to the 11-18 age group. The classes come at a premium though. While adult SoulCycle classes cost $34 each, teenagers (or at least their parents) must spend $40 a head. However, not everyone is a fan of SoulCycle. Celebrity trainer Tracey Anderson famously hit out at the movement, claiming the classes would make people’s legs bulky. In December 2012, Ms Anderson told the New York Times that the chain is overrated, saying: 'I can get you better legs than them.' She also claimed that the former employee of hers who started SoulCycle did it by stealing one of her inventions.

"Popular: Retailers have told health bosses that Mary Berry show The Great British Bake Off is behind a surge in sugar consumption . The popularity of The Great British Bake Off has been blamed for a spike in sugar intake as amateur cake makers take to the kitchen inspired by the hit TV show. Health bosses have been told by retailers that the BBC series featuring judges Mary Berry and Paul Hollywood is behind the rising amount of sugar consumed in the UK. Experts have recommended that people half their sugar consumption, but during talks over government dietary recommendations leading figures from the retail industry reportedly told Department of Health and Public Health England chiefs that Bake Off was behind a sugar surge. 'People at the meeting were blaming Mary Berry for a huge increase in the popularity of sugar as an ingredient,' a retail source present at the talks told The Grocer magazine. According to the most recent National Diet and Nutrition Survey figures, which cover 2008 to 2012, table sugar and preserves make up the single biggest contribution to adult sugar intake at 17 per cent. This compares to the 16 per cent from soft drinks, and nine per cent from confectionery, while buns, cakes and pastries made up another seven per cent. The 65 and over age group had the highest mean consumption of ‘table sugar, preserves and sweet spreads’, with 14g per day, while adults aged between 18 and 64 consumed 11g, and children from 11 to 18 six. Earlier this year, the World Health Organisation recommended that people halved their sugar intake - limiting consumption to around six teaspoons a day to avoid obesity, heart disease and other serious illnesses. The guideline amount was slashed dramatically amid fears that sugar poses the same threat to health as tobacco, and experts blame it for millions of premature deaths across the world every year. In its draft report on carbohydrates, including sugar, the Government's Scientific Advisory Committee on Nutrition backed the WHO sugar guidelines that around five per cent of energy intake should come from free sugars, down from the previous recommendation of ten. However, according to The Grocer, there has been criticism from retailers who say the committee has not explained in detail how it reached its recommendations. Consultation on the new document has taken place over the summer and ended last week, while in June Public Health England also released a new paper outlining the steps being taken to help families reduce their sugar intake, such as refreshing the 'Five a Day' campaign. Trend: Since Bake Off first aired in August 2010, sales of baking equipment, including flour, sugar and cooking chocolate, have increased while the show is on air . It states: 'People’s health would benefit if average sugar intakes in England were reduced. Sugar increases the risk of consuming too many calories, which, if sustained, causes weight gain and obesity.' A study released earlier this month showed that since Bake Off first aired in August 2010, sales of baking equipment, including flour, sugar and cooking chocolate, have increased while the show is on air - although the real baking boom occurs over Christmas. Following the Baked Alaska challenge, supermarket Waitrose reported an increase in the sales of vanilla ice cream, vanilla extract, caster sugar and eggs, as home bakers rushed to make their own versions. The fifth series of the show is currently airing on BBC1, having made the switch from BBC2 this year. Bin-cident: More people than ever have tuned in to Bake Off this year, with the series's 'bin gate' scandal attracting its biggest ever audience . More people than ever have tuned in, with the series's 'bin gate' scandal attracting its biggest ever audience. The controversial episode - in which contestant Iain Watters dumped his 'showstopper' baked Alaska  to cause an unlikely national kerfuffle - drew 10.25 million viewers, once viewers on catch-up TV services were added on. The previous high for Bake Off was the 2013 final which had a consolidated score of 9.4 million with the programme shown on BBC2, prior to the move to a new channel for this series. Watters's culinary catastrophe came after fellow contestant Diana Beard took his dish out of the freezer prompting many viewers to call for him to be reinstated. She subsequently pulled out of the show due to ill health. MailOnline has contacted the Department of Health and the BBC for comment.","Retailers tell Department of Health and Public Health England that BBC show is behind sugar surge .

"Jane Asher has admitted she was wrong to be so cynical as her bakeware range launched at Poundland has been so successful sales have soared past £2 million. Celebrity cake-maker Jane, 68, admits that she had doubts when she was offered a role as ambassador for the high street chain. But now the mother of three says that the link-up is a 'terrific fit' and even jokes that Poundland should be called Jane AsherLand. Jane's bargain bakeware range at Poundland has seen sales in excess of £2 million . The thrifty store first introduced the bargain bakeware last year ahead of the hugely popular Great British Bake Off TV show. It was revealed yesterday in The Grocer magazine that the 80 product range was the store's most popular and fastest-selling line yet. The magazine further reported that collection which launched in April this year has generated sales in excess of £2 million. Despite the huge success of the range Jane says she never expected it to do so well as she was concerned about the product quality. 'I'm not an obvious match for Poundland. It sounds soppy, but people trust that I use what I promote . 'I assumed they would source some stuff from the Far East and I would say ""this is going to fall to bits"" and that would be that, but it wasn't like that at all' she told The Grocer. Jane assumed that her range would be bad quality but she has been pleasantly surprised by the cheap products on offer . Jane went on to say that by convincing a sceptic such as herself Poundland would be able to attract other sceptical shoppers. 'I've been as surprised as anyone by being so wrong which is why I think it's very clever of them to use someone like me. 'It's ended up being a terrific fit. They are the nicest company I have ever worked for and I've worked with a lot.' Although Jane says that she is very proud of her range she says that perhaps it is not best suited for highly ambitious bakers. 'I love the idea you can have scales for a pound. Now, they are not going to last you. If you were seriously into baking they would drive you mad, but for a child, or for somebody starting off, they are perfect.' The celebrity baker even hopes that shop will go as far to credit her in the store name. ' I said we might have to make it Jane AsherLand. It's the only answer. ' Jane, who lives in London's affluent Chelsea, says she is a big fan of Waitrose when it comes to shopping for food however she also  says she enjoys shopping in discounted retailers and hopes to see a pound shop on the Kings Road soon. 'There aren't many near here in posh snobby Chelsea. We don't have a Poundland either. But it wouldn't surprise me if we see one soon.'","Jane launched her range for Poundland in April .

"The words 'life imitates art' ring true for one California festival. This summer, performers at Pageant of the Masters dressed up as figures from famous artworks, The New York Times reported. The staged recreations at the event, which is part of the Festival of Arts of Laguna Beach, are called 'living pictures,' the newspaper pointed out. Artistic: Volunteers dress up every year as famous artworks at Laguna Beach's Pageant of the Masters . Makeup, wigs, and costumes are all used to give the volunteers a look that closely resembles the original famous paintings and sculptures . The staged recreations are known as 'living artworks' The performance is set off by '[a]n outdoor amphitheater, professional orchestra, original score, live narration, intricate sets, sophisticated lighting, expert staff, and hundreds of dedicated volunteers,' according to the pageant's website. This summer, the theme for Pageant of the Masters was 'The Art Detective,' which its website claimed '[would] reveal how lost treasures were discovered, where crimes of passion were uncovered (or covered up) and how creative riddles were unraveled, with a gallery of the world’s great masterpieces providing the clues!' This summer, Pageant Director Diane Challis Davy told The Orange County Register 'This art detective theme has been on the back burner for several years. It is really quite coincidental that there’s so much in the news these days about World War II art, and lost and stolen art. So our show will open with scenes of art that disappeared, and art that went into hiding during World War II.' Actors' costumes are carefully painted to mimic the original artist's brushstrokes, and sets are painted to include the landscape and background features. Pageant of the Masters uses two volunteer casts, and some of the members have participated for years . Volunteers' costumes are tended to at the event . Volunteers work hold the poses during the performance in order to replicate the paintings . Can you tell it's fake? A woman poses in a recreation of a vintage poster . Some of the paintings that were recreated this summer with live human actors included Rembrandt's 'Nightwatch,' Piete Bruegel the Elder's 'Blind Leading the Blind,' Emanuel Leuze's 'Washington Crossing Delaware,' Edouard Manet's 'Olympia,' Vermeer's 'The Concert,' and John Singer Sargent's 'Portrait of Madame X,' according to a program published online. Among the sculptures were a variety of Egyptian scuptures, as well as Johannes of Bologne's 'The Rape of the Sabine Women' and Benevuto Cellini's 'Perseus with the Head of Medusa.' This year, film posters from the 30s and 40s were also recreated with the performers, including those from film noirs 'Double Indemnity' and 'The Maltese Falcon.' The New York Times reported the event grew out of a 1930s parade where artists dressed up as famous figures from art. 'The Pageant of the Masters sells out almost every night, more than 50 performances every summer, and this year took in close to $1 million after expenses,' The Times said. It also uses two volunteer casts, and some of the them have participated for upward of twenty years, according to the newspaper.

"Baked beans have been given a posh makeover by Fortnum & Mason. The 18th-century department store known for its rather posh preserves is selling a brand which has added onions, apple - and even bacon to the humble baked bean. While the concoction certainly sounds palatable, the price might make you think twice. At £3.95 for a pot of Proper Beans it's a big ask to dig deep for what you're used to spending no more than £1 on. But we conducted a taste test and found these beans are twice as good as Heinz - and 10 times tastier than Waitrose. Scroll down for video . MailOnline's Deni Kirkova taste tested four beans including Waitrose, Tesco, Heinz and Fortnum & Mason . Fortnum & Mason in fact first introduced baked beans to Britain in 1886. The once-revolutionary product is nowadays considered the cheap and cheerful preserve of students and children. But the retailer is changing the face of dining once more by reinventing the humble toast-topper into an upmarket side. Proper Beans Founder Ben Mason, 33, . decided to turn the market on its head, bringing recipes back to their . origins with gourmet versions of the humble staple. He had the idea for the brand from his father. ‘He told . me that he makes his own baked beans and it struck me as strange that . I'd never thought of it as something you can cook from scratch,' he . says. 'It's . crazy that tinned baked beans are a hugely successful universal . product, and yet nothing has really changed with them in so many years. Why haven't they improved like all the other food we eat?.' Far from being processed and tinned, his handmade beans are hand cooked with fresh ingredients including free-range meats and are found in the chilled section. Proper Beans are available in four varieties: such as smoked bacon & English mustard . The tasty gourmet side contained onions, tomato and chunky, meaty bacon . Recipes range from the classic pork, haricot beans and tomatoes (the origin of what we know as baked beans today) to vegetarian recipes and some more experimental ingredients such as British-grown fava beans. Proper Beans are available in four varieties: such as smoked bacon & English mustard - a pork and haricot bean combination inspired by classic baked bean recipes. 1. Fortum & Mason Proper Beans, £3.95, 'a gourmet side' 2. Heinz barbecue beans, 82p, 'comforting toast topper' 3. Tesco baked beans & pork sausages, 50p, 'processed hangover food' 4. Waitrose organic baked beans, 62p, 'vinegary and watery' They certainly were the tastiest - but we don't recommend using them as toast topping . After spending a year experimenting in his kitchen in Elephant and Castle, London, Ben left behind his job in advertising and decided to spend his life savings on starting Proper Beans. Ben: ‘The main focus for me was the taste. You can't reproduce a tin of baked beans at home; the ingredients are far too processed. Proper Beans are fresh, handmade and there's nothing in them that you couldn't buy at the supermarket. They taste so much better and they're just so much better for you. 'When I first told people that I resigned from my job and I was going into making baked beans some said ""you're completely crazy"". Most people think that beans can't change - always the same colour, and consistency. But as soon as they tried them, they realise what baked beans can and should be' Proper Beans are available in the chilled aisle at Fortnum and Masons at £3.95. Waitrose organic, at 62p, taste 'vinegary' - and are not worth the money, according to our taste test (l) as Heinz barbecue beans, 82p, were comforting and definitely one to pop on toast in chilly winter (r) Proper Beans are currently available in four varieties, and more are coming out soon - £3.95 each .","Fortum & Mason launched four new types of 'Proper Beans' at £3.95 each .

"An 18-year-old who was about to leave for basic training in the Army is now awake after being critically injured in a hit-and-run car accident in Holiday, Florida. The Florida Highway Patrol is asking for the public's help in finding the driver of a gray or silver van with obvious front-end passenger side damage who smashed into Michael Eberl early on Thursday morning while he was walking to a friend's house. Investigators say Eberl flew almost 100 feet through the air before landing in a ditch, according to Fox 13. Scroll down for video . Michael Eberl's family said his dream has long been to become an officer in the U.S. Army. He was supposed  to leave for basic training today following a goodbye party on Saturday when the car accident threatened to derail his dream . Eberl suffered multiple skull fractures and cranial bleeding from the hit-and-run accident. He's now awake but continues to breath from a tube. His family is concerned his brain may be damaged . A woman found Eberl about 40 minutes later, called 911 and stayed with him until paramedics arrived. Eberl, who graduated from high school earlier this year, was supposed to leave for basic training in the Army on Sunday. His going away party had been scheduled for the previous day. Veronica Scott, the teenager's mother, feared the incident could ruin his life. 'It kills me,' she said. 'He was supposed to leave for basic training.' Eberl, who is originally from Duluth, Minnesota, according to his Facebook page, is recovering after suffering multiple skull fractures and cranial bleeding at Bayonet Point Regional Medical Center in nearby Hudson. He is still connected to a breathing tube. Eberl, third from left, was a member of his high school's JROTC and competed in raider competitions, in which cadets compete against students from other schools and learn military survival skills .

'I definitely want to see him in his uniform 'cause that's what he loves,' his mother said, adding that he remains strong. 'When he would start to wake up a little bit, he would give us the thumbs up. And that's Michael,' she said. Eberl didn't break any bones, but his family is worried about how the accident will affect his brain, Fox 13 reported. 'He has several skull fractures. A ventilator is helping him breathe,' his uncle Noah Ruhanen said. 'He is a healthy 18-year-old, which is definitely on his side.' Eberl likes hip hop music, the book 'Marley and Me', the Minnesota Vikings and chocolate chip cookies, according to his Facebook profile. He was also a JROTC cadet at his high school and competed in raider competitions, in which students gain some basic military training and learn survival skills. Tyler Ruhanen is demanding justice for the person who left his brother for dead. 'It's just hard every time you walk in there knowing it's your brother laying in that bed and not someone else,' said Ruhanen, who asked the driver of the vehicle to 'just turn yourself in'.

"Ever  since man embarked on his ceaseless quest for knowledge, there have been questions that don’t really need answers. But yesterday some of the finest minds of science, engineering and craftsmanship combined to examine one of them anyway: precisely how useless is a chocolate teapot? Would it turn into a steaming, molten splodge as soon as boiling water was introduced? Wouldn’t the spout just go floppy and prevent the tea being poured? And surely the brew would taste like a cross between day-old hot choc and recycled canal water? Useful at last! A team of scientists and engineers have created a fully-functioning chocolate teapot (pictured) that can brew tea for two minutes without completely melting . All these imponderables . faced a specialist team at Nestlé when the corporation set about trying . to determine the effectiveness or otherwise of a mythical piece of . culinary equipment that has become part of modern English usage as an . insult (To wit: ‘He’s as useful as a chocolate teapot’). It . took six weeks of planning, countless equations and several failed . prototypes before master chocolatier John Costello and his team at the . Nestlé Product Technology Centre in York were ready to craft the perfect . teapot from chocolate. The moment of truth: Scientists settled on using dark chocolate with 65 per cent chocolate solids, due to its fat content. Here, One Show presenter Marty Jopson pours hot water into the chocolate teapot . Chocolate ingredients determine the material's heat resistance and its melting point. Chocolatiers are interested in the science of chocolate to influence how it tastes and feels in the mouth. The melting point is typically just above 36°C so it melts in the mouth, according to Food-Info. If the melting point is very high, the mixture will feel waxy. If it is too low, it doesn't store well and separates. First . decision: milk or plain? They opted for dark chocolate with a 65 per . cent cocoa content, the logic being that it contained the best fat . composition to stay solid. And in any case, it tastes rather good. Then a . pukka-looking teapot, short and stout, was crafted in a silicone mould. The pot had a large opening at the lid to let the initial waft of steam . escape quickly, and a hand-hollowed spout.

"A life-saving genetic test for prostate cancer could be developed after British scientists found the 100th gene for the disease. The researchers believe they may be able to tell whether a man’s DNA puts him at higher than average risk of the cancer, which kills almost 11,000 Britons a year. A simple, cheap NHS saliva test could be ready in five years for men of at least 55. The researchers believe they may be able to tell whether a man’s DNA puts him at higher than average risk of the cancer, which kills almost 11,000 Britons a year . Almost 42,000 cases are diagnosed in the UK each year, making it the most common male cancer. But there is no accurate test. Scientists from the Institute of Cancer Research in London, Cambridge University and the U.S. examined the DNA of 90,000 men. Half had the cancer and comparing their DNA with that of healthy men revealed genes that raised the risk of the disease. Some 77 . genes were already known, but the research took the total to 100, the . journal Nature Genetics reported – enough for a genetic test to be . created. It is hoped the test will also be able to distinguish how dangerous a man’s cancer is. The Great North Run was held through the streets of Tyneside to raise money for Prostate Cancer UK . Prostate cancer may grow so slowly that it never causes men any problems and they die of something else. But a fast-growing, dangerous form needs urgent attention. Difficulty in telling them apart can mean men with the less severe form receive painful, unnecessary treatment.

It was reported that the plane had crashed into a paddock while on approach to land at the airport near Henry Lawson Drive. A man and woman were killed in a light plane crash in Mudgee, two-hours north of Bathurst in New South Wales . It is believed that the pilot and passenger were a couple. Officers from Mudgee Local Area Command attended the scene where they located a man, deceased inside the single-engine two-seater plane. The pilot who was in his 60s died on impact while the only passenger, a woman died on the scene as paramedics attempted to revive her. A crime scene has been established at the airport and will be examined. The  Australian Transport Safety Bureau and forensic officers joined a Police investigation. Stuart Godley from the Australian Transport Safety Bureau told ABC News that police will guard the site overnight and two investigators will arrive there tomorrow morning. 'We don't really know what's happened at this stage,' he said. 'All we know is that it is a small single engine aircraft, it's a Vans RV-6 and it's amateur built. 'That means it's been built by the owner, most likely the pilot.'

"The former fiancee of South Carolina Representative Mark Sandford says she learned of the official end of their relationship in the same way the rest of the world did: on Facebook. Maria Belen Chapur says Sandford's shock announcement came after the two spent a romantic week together in Paris. Chapur says that after a tumultuous five-year relationship, she pressed Sanford on the issue of marriage during their 'honeymoon'-like holiday. Scroll down for video . Broken engagement: Representative Mark Sanford, with his former fiancee Maria Belen Chapur at his side, addresses supporters in Mount Pleasant, South Carolina, on Tuesday, April 2, 2013 . ‘I had a spectacular week, you know I love you, but I don’t want to continue in the category of mistress, and if we continue like this I continue in that category, and I can’t bear it anymore. It has been really painful to me,' Chapur told The New York Times she explained to Sandford. She continued, 'His response was, ""24 months. If not I’ll say goodbye and I will look for you in 24 months.""' The next Chapur heard of her relationship with Sandford was a 2,346-word public Facebook post. 'I learned it from the press today,' she told The New York Times Saturday. In a very personal post on his Facebook detailing his latest spat with his former spouse,  Sanford announced that he and his mistress-turned-fiancee, Chapur, a woman he once called his 'soul mate,' had called off their wedding plans. 'No relationship can stand forever this tension of being forced to pick between the one you love and your own son or daughter, and for this reason Belen and I have decided to call off the engagement,' Sanford wrote. 'Maybe there will be another chapter when waters calm with Jenny, but at this point the environment is not conducive to building anything given no one would want to be caught in the middle of what’s now happening,' he said, referring to accusations levied against him in court last month by his ex-wife. Unceremonious: Chapur says she had no warning before Sandford posted a 2,346-word missive about their break-up on Facebook . Jenny Sanford suggested in a court motion that her former husband does illegal and prescription drugs and gets drunk in front of their teenage son Blake. She also asked the court to require Sanford to undergo psychological tests and restrict his visits with his son. Another section of the motion asks the judge to ban both parents from having overnight guests of the opposite sex who could be considered a 'paramour.' While the court filing submitted by Jenny Sanford's lawyers repeatedly asks the that the judge ban both Sanfords from inappropriate conduct in front of their youngest son, the motion makes clear that it is Mark Sanford's behavior that instigated the legal proceedings. Addressing the issue on Facebook, Sanford said, 'This really is crazy.' 'I have never taken any illegal drug in my life,' he said. 'I did not drink in high school or college and though I do drink now, my consumption is so limited that my friends give me a hard time about it. I will have but one beer or two when out at a social occasion.' Sanford also contended that his longtime girlfriend, with whom he began having an extra-marital affair with in 2008, had never spent the night when his two younger sons were staying with him. And Chapur only stayed over two times when his two older sons were under his roof, he said. 'Though Jenny herself has certainly not lived up to this clause it is clearly aimed at me given near everyone knows about Belen and in that regard it seems designed to create intrigue where none exists,' he charged. Buried in the long Facebook post about his ongoing divorce drama is an announcement that he and Chapur separated as a result of the stress placed on their relationship by his legal battles with his ex-wife. Messy divorce: Sandford wrote that he broke his engagement with Chapur under the stress of ongoing legal battles with his ex-wife Jenny Sandford, with whom he split after his affair with Chapur was made public . 'Belen is a remarkably wonderful woman who I have always loved and I will be forever grateful for not only the many years we have known and loved each other,' he said, 'but the last six very tough ones wherein she has encouraged me and silently borne its tribulations with her ever warm and kind spirit.' The Argentina native and Sanford had been engaged since August of 2012. The relationship became the subject of intense media coverage after the still-married Sanford revealed in 2009 that the two were having an affair. Sanford was serving as South Carolina Governor at the time of the scandal. He got caught with his hands in the cookie jar after claiming that he was hiking in the Appalachian mountains for six days when he was really in Argentina carrying on with his lover. Jenny Sanford separated from her husband soon after the love affair was reported in the press, and the couple was granted a divorce in 2010. After spending several years out of the public eye, Sanford, who was once thought to be a contender for the Republican nomination for the presidency in 2012, jumped back into public spotlight when he reclaimed a congressional seat he once held in a May 2013 special election. In a 2,346 word post on his Facebook page on Friday Sanford claimed that he first heard about his wife's new court filings through the media and that he has 'struggled in how to respond' for the past week and a half. Social media post: Chapur said she was made aware of her split with Sandford by the press after he posted a long Facebook update . The Republican lawmaker said he didn't originally intend to respond publicly to his former spouses claims, but he had 'prayed on it, thought on it and asked the advice of friends' and came to the conclusion his constituents deserved an explanation. 'In as much as you sign my paycheck and you have elected me to represent you in Washington, I think I owe you my thinking on this personal, but now public matter,' he said. Sanford said he had tried to turn the other cheek, as commanded in the Bible, but recently discovered that 'I cannot do this anymore.' 'In all life there comes a point wherein lines must be drawn in the way that we attempt to respond in ways that don’t invite more in the way of conflict and add more in the way of modeling Christ’s humility in giving in every instance. 'I’ll never get that mix right, none of us do,' he said, 'but I believe it’s what we are to pursue in all of our responses to the inevitable reality of conflict in our lives.' The conservative congressman said that in the past he had not hired lawyers to fight is court battles against his ex wife, including during his divorce, and had instead represented himself or relied on the help of friends in order to save his children - and his pocketbook - from unnecessary pain. From now on, he said Friday, he'll be allowing a lawyer to handle the situation 'so that I can focus without further distraction on our boys and my work in Washington.' Even though his ex-wife continues to attack him, Sanford said he would 'never attempt attempt to detract from her or all the positive things she has done in her life.' 'I hope and believe Jenny and I can find a new way,' he said. 'It’s also reminder for every one of you who have been blessed to avoid the agony of divorce, of how important it is you spend time when you have it with those who now bear your name.'","Maria Belen Chapur says she was made aware of Mark Sandford's decision to end their engagement by the press .

"Just two servings of fish a week can slash the risk of hearing loss by a fifth, according to a new study. Oily fish such as sardines, salmon and mackerel are rich in omega-3 fatty acids, which have already been shown to stave off heart disease, dementia, cancer, depression and arthritis. Now a study of women has shown that consumption can lower the risk of deafness. US researchers looked at a study of 65,215 nurses who were followed between 1991 and 2009, during which time 11,606 cases of hearing loss were reported. In comparison with women who rarely consumed fish, those who ate it at least twice a week were 20 per cent less likely to develop deafness. Oily fish, such as sardines, ve already been shown to stave off heart disease, dementia, cancer, depression and arthritis. Now a study of women has shown that consumption can lower the risk of deafness . The study was published online by the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition. One of the authors – Dr Sharon Curhan of Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston – said acquired hearing loss was often a disabling chronic health condition. She added: ‘Although a decline in hearing is often considered an inevitable aspect of ageing the identification of several potentially modifiable risk factors has provided new insight into possibilities for prevention or delay of acquired hearing loss. Doctors say that eating fish, which is packed with vitamins and minerals, on a regular basis can help stave off a range of serious diseases and help protect health in later life . ‘Consumption of any type of fish – tuna, dark fish, light fish or shellfish – tended to be associated with lower risk. These findings suggest diet may be important in the prevention of acquired hearing loss.’ Doctors say that eating fish, which is packed with vitamins and minerals, on a regular basis can help stave off a range of serious diseases and help protect health in later life. A previous study in 2008 found that eating oily fish two or more times a week could reduce the risk of age-related macular degeneration – a common cause of blindness in older people. Research from 2004 also suggests that consumption of oily fish helped protect against heart disease, while other studies have found that it can lower blood pressure and reduce the build up of fat in arteries. Alison Hornby, a spokesman for the British Dietetic Association, states on the NHS website: ‘The benefits of eating at least two portions of fish a week, including one of oily fish, include keeping your blood pressure at a healthy level and improving blood lipids, both of which reduce your risk of cardiovascular disease, the biggest killer in the UK. ‘You can get your omega-3 from a range of oily fish. Tinned sardines and mackerel are an easy way to stock up the store cupboard.’","Eating fish such as sardines, salmon and mackerel can help maintain hearing .

"Hundreds of alcoholics have been refused liver transplants in the past five years because they have not been able to stop drinking. More than 160 patients with severe alcohol-induced liver disease have been denied a transplant, including a teenager at King's College Hospital in London and two people in their twenties. Doctors say liver disease victims are getting younger by the year and that the majority of those refused a liver transplant will soon die. More than 160 patients with severe alcohol-induced liver disease have been denied a transplant in five years . At University Hospitals Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust, eight of the 12 patients who were declined a liver transplant died, including two in their twenties, according to the Sunday Times. Doctors became concerned about the refusal of liver transplants after the death of Gary Reinbach, 22, from Essex, in 2009. He died of liver failure after being denied a potentially life-saving transplant because he was not able to give up alcohol. The NHS Blood and Transplant Service announced in April this year that alcoholics suffering from severe liver disease will be allowed to have transplants on the NHS for the first time. Gary Reinbach, aged nine (far right), died at the age of 22 after being refused a liver transplant . It will affect those with 'severe alcohol-associated hepatitis' (SAAH), who have until now been excluded from transplants because the prognosis was so poor. The scheme is controversial because there is a national shortage of suitable organs for transplant. And critics say those who bring ill-health on themselves should not receive such help. Rajiv Jalan, professor of hepatology at University College London believes that teenagers may be more susceptible to liver disease than adults. 'The enzyme systems in the livers of adults are geared up for more 'detoxification', which may explain the increased susceptibility of young people to the effects of alcohol,' he said. Footballer George Best was not able to stop drinking after a life-saving liver transplant in 2002 . He said it was correct to refuse transplants for the majority of alcoholics who fail to abstain for a period. But pointed out there are some who do not realise the harm caused by binge drinking until it is too late. 'Transplanting patients who are not able to abstain is likely to risk the survival of the organ, which is a scare resource,' he said. 'About 15 to 20 per cent of patients die while waiting for an organ. Every time that we decide to transplant someone, another patient will be disadvantaged and may well die.' There were 549 patients on the NHS liver transplant list in March this year, an increase of 12 per cent from the previous year. A spokesperson for NHS Blood and Transplant, said: 'The sad reality is that there aren't enough donated organs available for everybody who could potentially benefit from an organ transplant to receive one. 'Around three people die every day across the UK in need of an organ transplant. 'We remain committed to being transparent and providing an allocation system that is based on clinical need and benefit and is not judgemental. 'That said, organs are transplanted into patients that are likely to have the best outcomes. There is guidance in place governing how patients are assessed for liver transplants and the decision whether or not to list a patient lies with the transplant team. 'We need more people to support donation, to join the NHS Organ Donor Register and to let their families know they want to donate. Every potential organ donor is precious but unfortunately four out of ten families approached about donation do not give the go ahead.'","More than 160 alcoholics refused liver transplants in the past five years .

"A New York woman slowly going blind and deaf thanks to an extremely rare condition has opened up about her struggle to cope with her disabilities in a new memoir. Author an activist Rebecca Alexander, 35, said the signs of her condition were already appearing shortly after she turned 13 and would no longer respond to someone calling her name from another room. Alexander suffers from Usher syndrome, which afflicts about one person in 23,000 in the U.S. and for which there is no cure and little research available, all detailed in her book 'Not Fade Away: A Memoir of Senses Lost and Found.' Author an activist Rebecca Alexander, 35, said the signs of her condition were already appearing shortly after she turned 13 and would no longer respond to someone calling her name from another room . 'Fifteen years ago, I was told that, by now, there would be something to . help stop the progression of this, and potentially even a cure,' she tells the The New York Post. 'Part of me feels really angry that people could be so careless, . to promise something like that.' But sadly that was not to be the case. 'The words pounded like a drumbeat in my head,' she remembers of her diagnosis. 'No cure, no stopping it.' She grew up in Oakland, Calif., with two brothers, and though their father had fits of mania and depression and her parents divorced when she was 12 she still describes her childhood as 'idyllic.' But as she got older, he parents argued over how to deal with her diagnosis with her father wanting . Alexander's new book 'Not Fade Away' will detail her struggles with Usher syndrome . to keep the truth from her as long as possible so she could enjoy her childhood. 'At the time, my night vision was the most significantly impaired,' she says. 'So my dad said, ‘We can tell her she has difficulty . seeing at night, and in time we’ll get to that place where we’ll tell . her more.’' To this day she is uncertain exactly how her parents finally revealed the truth to her, only being driven to a conference for the Foundation Fighting Blindness at the age of 15. The trip was her first exposure to guide dogs, canes, and people her age who were already completely blind. She remembers being unnerved when a woman who's vision was impaired was unable to maintain direct eye contact in a conversation as her eyes drifted to the right. 'I remember looking at her and wondering what she could see,' she says. She describes her site today as 'the end of one of those old Warner Bros. cartoons on TV, where Bugs Bunny sits in the center of . the screen waving goodbye as the picture becomes an increasingly smaller . hole, until it’s finally gone, leaving only blackness. That’s all, . folks.' It's a life she once thought she'd rather die than deal with. 'I just couldn’t imagine living into adulthood,' she tells The Post. 'I couldn’t imagine what that would mean.' She dealt with the fear by living hard during her teenage years, dating, getting a driver's license, and insisting she attend college across the country. After one particularly bad fight with her high-school boyfriend and too many drinks the summer before she was to leave, she fell through an open window 27 feet to the ground and ended up with almost every bone broken. 'All of my friends went off to college, and I’m finding out my . high-school boyfriend is hooking up with chicks and joined a fraternity . and is getting s—t-faced all the time, and I’m fully casted,' she recalls. If there was a silver-lining to the year-long rehab - and Alexander is described as nothing if not positive - it was that she says she gained a better sense of comfort with being by herself. 'I didn't know that I was as comfortable, before,' she says, 'with loneliness.' When she did make it to college, she tried to keep her condition secret, sliding the hearing aids she now wearing beneath her pillow when she had a boy over or hiding them under her long brown hair. Alexander says she infuriated by viral videos of cochlear implants she says mislead people about how they work . 'I remember when I was a little girl and we went skiing and I saw . someone wearing a ‘blind skier’ sign on their back,' she says. 'I . felt almost humiliated for that person. It was such an exposure. Now, if . I went skiing, that would be me.' She says the first time she had to use a cane was exhausting just explaining her condition to friends who had never seen her use an aid before. 'I’d almost rather wear a f—king sign that says, ‘I have a degenerative . condition that’s making me lose my hearing and my vision — that’s why . I’m using a cane.’ But whatever,' she says. Now she using a mini goldendoodle to help make her way through the city and lives in a one-bedroom apartment on New York's Upper East Side. She has a private practice as a psychotherapist and moonlights as a spin instructor, and has two master's degrees from Columbia. The city has unique hazards for the blind. She's been hit by cabs and had her feet run over and has fallen through one of the metal double doors that marks so many streets. She sometimes worries dates from J-Date or Tinder might Google her and get scared off and was stood up just last week. 'At this point, it's a free-for-all,' she says. Alexander She has a private practice as a psychotherapist and moonlights as a spin instructor, and has two master's degrees from Columbia . She also says that the viral videos of children hearing for the first time with cochlear implants - which she has - are infuriating as they give people a false idea of the process. After agonizing over the decision she finally had an implant done in her right ear, but it delivers digitized voices that never sound right. 'When I was first implanted, I felt like, ‘What the f—k have I done?’ All the residual hearing in my right ear has gone, and now I have this . weird, f—ked-up Mickey Mouse voice in my head. And everyone says it’s . like a journey.' Alexandra would argue that it's more 'a s—tload' of hard work. Speaking of, she's in for a lot more of that next July when she crosses off one of her last goals before she loses the remainder of her sight. 'Climbing Mt.

"An ICM poll put Alex Salmond's pro-independence campaigners on 54% . Last night’s polls only serve to underline how the independence vote remains on a knife-edge. An ICM poll put Alex Salmond’s pro-independence campaigners on 54 per cent with the No camp trailing way behind on 46. Two other polls gave the No camp a clear lead and yet another suggested that the fight was heading for a dead heat. Yesterday’s ICM poll – giving the Yes vote one of its highest-ratings yet – sent a chill through the keep-the-Union camp and cooled hopes that the No campaign was finally pulling ahead. However, polling expert John Curtice immediately gave the ICM verdict a ‘substantial health warning’, saying it was based on a smaller-than-usual sample of 705 people and was potentially more ‘vulnerable’ to error. On a day of rapidly-changing fortunes, the Better Together campaign was celebrating after a Survation survey produced 54-46 result in favour of No voters. Later, a second poll called it for the Yes camp, with an eight-point lead. But then an Opinium/Observer survey had the pro-Union camp six points ahead on 53 per cent compared to the Yes lobby’s 47. Surprisingly, it claimed that last week’s surprise offer of a raft of new devo-max powers – unveiled after a YouGov poll last weekend put Yes in the lead – seemed to have had little impact on how people intended to vote. But before the No camp could relax, the fourth and final poll published yesterday put the rival camps at almost neck and neck. The Panelbase survey, for the Sunday Times, had Yes on 49.4 per cent and No on 50.6 per cent. Last night, polling experts insisted the final result in four days’ time was still too close to call.

"Divers off the the coast of Costa Rica were recently approached by a massive manta ray, but what could have been a rattling encounter for the scuba divers suddenly became an humanitarian mission. Amazingly, the massive winged fish--which was entangled in painful-looking fishing line--appeared to be pleading with the international dive team for help being set free. The shocked divers obliged, cutting the thick cords from the ray, whose species can weigh as much as 5,000 pounds and have a wingspan of 18 feet. Needed a favor: A team of scuba divers off the Costa Rican coast encountered this giant oceanic manta ray this month. But they didn't go looking for the massive fish, it came looking for them .

'We picked up the line. It's our trophy now! Brian, the diver who cut the line, gave a little piece for all divers there! The giant oceanic manta ray is the largest species of ray and is a type of eagle ray. Scientists believe the ray has the largest brain of all fish species. However, they've yet to determine just how intelligent the majestic, winged fish actually is. Like other massive ocean animals such as whale sharks and the largest of whales, mantas are filter feeders and eat only the ocean's tiniest organisms. The giant oceanic manta is believed to be highly migratory, routinely crossing entire oceans. Free! The ray did a backflip in celebration and to kick off that last bit of fishing line . Unforgettable: Free and clear from the cord, the manta went about its way a free fish and the astonished divers kept the line as a memento of the unforgettable day .","The gentle giant was entangled off the Bat Islands of Costa Rica .

"A man killed his partner and  left her body in a hotel room before taking his own life, police said yesterday. Detectives launched a murder investigation after the body of a woman, believed to be in her early forties, was found in a room at a Premier Inn at 9am on Saturday. At around 5.30pm the same day police received a report that a man in his late thirties had died on a  railway line. The man, who was found dead on  railway lines at Nuneaton, Warwickshire, killed his wife in a hotel room 70 miles away, police say . His body was found on the tracks in Nuneaton, Warwickshire – just over 60 miles from the Premier Inn in Kempston, Bedfordshire. Detectives yesterday confirmed that the man was believed to be  the same person they were trying  to trace in connection with the  hotel murder. A Bedfordshire Police spokesman also confirmed the pair were in  a relationship. A post-mortem examination was due to take place yesterday on the woman, who was revealed to be from Milton Keynes.

"Greg Norman was lucky to escape with both hands intact after a chainsaw accident saw the Australian professional golfer rushed to hospital. The 59-year-old is currently recovering from the accident in a US hospital. Despite the ordeal, Mr Norman clearly remained in good spirits as he took to Instagram to share a picture of himself in his hospital bed. Scroll down for video . Greg Norman revealed he was in hospital via an Instagram post in which he said he had been involved in an accident while using a chainsaw . 'Working with a chainsaw ALWAYS be respectful of the unexpected,' Mr Norman wrote in the pictures caption, accompanied by symbols of hands and a thumbs up. 'I was one lucky man today. Damaged, but not down and out. Still have left hand.' The image shows the former golfer lying in a hospital bed, hooked up to tubes and monitors. The Australian professional golfer said he was 'one lucky man' and said that he still has his left hand . A hole in a purple foam object beside him, shows a glimpse of Mr Norman's left arm, which appears to be bandaged. Only a week earlier, the pro golfer had shared a image of himself using what is likely to be the same chainsaw on his property. Smiling at the camera with the machine in his arms, Mr Norman is pictured standing on a beach beside a heavy branch he'd just cut down. Norman, who currently lives in Florida in the United States, was formerly ranked the world's best golfer . 'Time to trim the sea grapes today,' the caption said. 'Never ask someone to do something that you can do yourself. Love to work!'

"These striking pictures show Iraqi Christians praying for their lives and livelihoods - as just a few miles away, Islamic State militants fight to take both away from them. The men and women who went to Sunday Mass yesterday at St Joseph Church in Irbil, northern Iraq, form part of a fast-dwindling minority as extremists sweep through their nation enforcing a violent interpretation of Sunni Islam. Only a thin line of Kurdish fighters, supported by a few hundred U.S. troops, separate them from the violence which has engulfed wide stretches of Iraq, including the city of Mosul 50 miles away. Scroll down for video . Praying: Iraqi Christians are under threat from the violent spread of Islamic State militants. Pictured, women pray in a Sunday Mass at St Joseph Church in the Kurdish capital Irbil, which has so far remained untouched . Dwindling: Reports say the number of Christians in Iraq has dropped sharply over the last decade . Militants have threatened those who do not follow their interpretation of Islam with death. Christians, because of their association with the West, are among the most hated by the Islamists. Others in peril include the Yazidi people, tens of thousands of whom were besieged on a mountaintop in desperate need of food and water by Islamic State militants. Many Christians have fled the country in the latest crisis, adding to the numbers which observers say have been trickling out since the 2003 war and the insurgencies that followed. Reports claimed there were 1.5million Christian Iraqis in 2003, but this number dropped to less than 500,000 last year. Some estimates of the current number have been as low as 200,000. Minorities: Non-Muslims are particularly vulnerable to the militants, who threaten their enemies with slaughter . Despite the danger, the church remains similar to those in the West, with rounded windows and wooden pews . Others, however, have remained in Irbil. The Kurdish regional capital, which has 1.5million residents, has remained mostly untouched by the militants - but not by the killing sprees they have caused. Many of what used to be Iraq's biggest Christian strongholds have already been taken by the militants, including the second city of Mosul and the city of Qaraqosh. Thousands of refugees have flooded into the areas around Irbil, which is home to the sprawling Baherka refugee camp. More than 1.8million people have been displaced across Iraq since the rapid advance by Islamic State militants first began in January, according to the United Nations. Even in towns near Irbil which have been seized back by the Kurds, residents are unwilling to return. One, Gwer, has been left as a ghost town after its 20,000 citizens were too frightened to go back. Resolute: Many Christians have fled Iraq in the crisis, but others have stayed firmly in cities such as Irbil . Under siege: A recent study shows the extent to which Islamic State militants have swept through Iraq . Kurdish peshmerga forces are left to patrol the streets, where the phrase 'Islamic State' is daubed on many buildings. In many cases it is misspelled to read Salam State - state of peace - a sign that many of the militants holding the town were probably foreign fighters. Irbil is also home to U.S. troops who are bolstering Kurdish forces in their fight against the militants. Overall around 1,500 U.S. military personnel are in Iraq, many of them embedded with the country's security forces to find targets for air strikes. The U.S. has launched more than 150 such strikes against the militants, which could be stepped up after the beheading of British hostage David Haines.","Men and women prayed at St Joseph Church in northern city of Irbil .

"Two boys missing in rugged forest north of Rocky Mountain National Park have been found alive and well. Larimer County officials say the boys, ages 11 and 12, were separated from their group while hunting small game. They did not require any medical attention when found on Sunday and were being reunited with their hunting party from the local area. Far to roam: The two boys aged 11 and 12 reportedly disappeared sometime Saturday and spent the night alone in the wilds of the Rocky Mountains in Colorado . The boys were armed with .22-caliber rifles and had backpacks with survival gear, water and food. Authorities were contacted on Sunday morning. Officials said family members assisted with the search. Authorities said several agencies and an aircraft helped in the search for the boys. Mulitple agencies including the U.S. Forest Service, Colorado Parks and Wildlife, Larimer County Search and Rescue and the Larimer County Sheriff's Office had been called in to work on finding the boys, reports the Denver Channel.","The boys were separated from their group in the wilds of Larimer County, where they spent the night in the wilderness on Saturday .

"A Malaysia Airlines jet was forced to dump fuel and turn back to Kuala Lumpur Airport on Sunday after a technical problem. Earlier reports said Flight MH198, heading for Hyderabad in India, was on fire, but the airline dismissed this and said the problem was with the auto-pilot. Although the aircraft landed safely back at Kuala Lumpur International Airport at 2am on Sunday, it was yet another incident that the airline could do without. It has been plagued by the disappearance of MH370, the crash of MH17 and a number of 'smaller' incidents that have resulted in aircraft turning back or making an emergency landing. Malaysia Airlines jet was forced to dump fuel and turn back to Kuala Lumpur Airport after a technical problem . In a statement later today Malaysia Airlines said the turn-back to the airport was due to an auto-pilot defect. Denying initial claims that the aircraft had been on fire, the airline said the defect did not have any impact on the safety of the jet or the passengers, the number of whom was not immediately available. 'As a precautionary measure, the captain decided to turn back to the airport,' said a spokesman. 'Upon arrival, passengers and crew disembarked safely and were given accommodation at nearby hotels.' The jet arrived at the airport some four hours after take off. Earlier, a flight-tracking website reported that MH198 was in a holding pattern and 'burning fuel' after departure. It is thought that the 'burning fuel' description had given rise to claims that the aircraft was on fire. Malaysia Airlines has lost two Boeing 777-220s this year, with the mystery disappearance of MH370 and the bringing down of MH17 over eastern Ukraine. The Hyderabad-bound flight was due to resume later on Sunday.

"A terrifying Tim Burton marionette flown drones could someday replace the fireworks and floats at Disney World. This is according to three drone-related patents filed by the company that could pave the way for larger-than-life puppets flying through the sky. The first describes an aerial display system, with drones choreographed to form displays of floating pixels, similar to fireworks. A giant Nightmare Before Christmas puppet wielded by flying drones could be seen at Disney World. An image from a patent filed by Disney shows how drones could control a huge puppet's dance move . The second uses drones to fly and position flexible projection screens on which light could be reflected above a crowd. A final patent suggests using drones to move the legs and arms of 'blimp-sized' Disney string puppets. Disney joins a list of companies pressing for the US government to allow commercial use of small unmanned flight systems long associated with military and government surveillance. The Federal Aviation Administration is in the process of drafting rules for the commercial use of drones for everything from TV news coverage to package delivery to crop monitoring. Disney joins a list of companies pressing for the U.S. government to allow commercial use of small unmanned flight systems long associated with military and government surveillance. One of the three patents suggests using drones to move the legs and arms of 'blimp-sized' Disney character string puppets . Disney hopes to use drones as part of their world-famous theme park shows. In this image, drones are shown autonomously assembling a fantasy superstructure above a demonstration or viewing area . The drones would be pre-programmed and controlled from the ground and would monitor each other to remain synchronised and prevent aerial collisions in the event of wind gusts, the company said. In the case of marionettes, a drone could carry a  character through the sky to simulate flight depicted in passages from books and films, according to the patent application. 'This is a significant improvement over prior flying characters, which typically were provided in the form of parade or other blimps/balloons filled with hot air or other gases and that had little and/or awkward articulation of any movable parts,' the company said in its patent application. The inventors for all three patents were listed as Clifford Wong of Burbank,  James Alexander Stark of South Pasadena and Robert Scott Trowbridge, all based in California. The company did not respond to a request for comment. A New York partygoer has spoken of his shock after being hit by a drone at a hi-tech 'home of the future' party. Publisher Stephen Kosloff tweeted shocking images from the party, organised by gadget website Gizmodo, of his blood-stained t- shirt after an out of control drone hit him in the head. The drone, which is believed to have had technical problems, hit Kosloff in the ear and forehead. 'I am now the only person I know who was wounded by a #drone at a @Gizmodo party. #tech' he tweeted. 'A few folks had the drone on a table, and they fired it up again,' Kosloff told The Awl . 'Next thing I know, WHAM!!!!!!! Right in my f**king head. The drone.'","Disney drones could carry displays of floating pixels, similar to fireworks .

"'Knife attack': Police said that Mary Galvis, pictured, lashed out at her young children with a knife this morning . A mother allegedly stabbed two of her own children in their home, leaving them with serious injuries. Mary Glavis, 47, took a knife to her 8-year-old son and 12-year-old daughter in a frenzied attack in West Valley, Utah, police said. Galvis lunged at her children several times, according to witness reports, and also lashed out at her teenage daughter, who received less serious wounds. She was only stopped from her attack when the teen's screams woke the children's father, who was able to wrest the knife from her hands, the Desert News reported. A police spokesman said: 'The father heard the commotion and was able to prevent it from going any further. 'Investigators are still speaking to her and trying to find out what caused all this.' Police were called to the scene after the teenage girl was able to raise the alarm - and were warned Galvis might be crazed. The other two children were taken to hospital with multiple stab wounds. Their condition was said to be critical when they arrived, but has since stabilized. Galvis was taken to the Salt Lake County Jail, where officers said she was co-operating with the investigation.

"Wealthy politician Clive Palmer is no longer part of the billionaire's club as his fortune has halved in the past 12 months. The mining magnate and Palmer United Party leader's empire is reported to have dropped by $1.04 billion to $932 million, according to The Sunday Mail. Mr Palmer has fallen off the number one perch for the first time since 2008 in the publication's Queensland Top 150 Rich List. Scroll down for video . Clive Palmer is no longer part of the billionaire's club as his fortune has halved in the past 12 months . The title of Queensland’s richest person now belongs to John Van Lieshout who established his Super A-Mart furniture chain into a retail giant, sold it and now heads a property empire. However, the annual Australian Top 200 rich list published by finance magazine BRW in June reported the MP still had held onto the billionaire title with a listed wealth of $1.2 billion. This comes as Mr Palmer’s former accountant and friend claims that the politician’s businesses were on the brink of bankruptcy during his Federal election campaign last year. In an affidavit, Palmer's former top executive and campaigning partner Bill Schoch claims that while Mr Palmer was publicly claiming to be a billionaire, his companies were experiencing a cashflow crisis. Mr Schoch alleges the companies were on the verge of corporate financial collapse and Mr Palmer was so desperate for funds that he accepted a settlement deal from the tax office just two days after the 2013 federal election. The mining magnate and Palmer United Party leader's empire is reported to have dropped by $1.04 billion to $932 million . The colourful character also added over 100 animatronic dinosaurs to his resort in Coolum, creating a simulated Jurassic Park . Controversy seems to follow the outspoken businessman with the latest allegation coming from a former employee who claims that Mr Palmer demanded the worker be sacked after referring to him as 'fat ****'. Peter Yates, a former assistance food and beverage manager at Palmer Coolum Resort in Queensland, lodged a claim with the Fair Work Commission against Mr Palmer after he was fired in June. When questioned by Daily Mail Australia about the incident last week, Mr Palmer denied having any knowledge of the sacking. Mr Palmer owns Mineralogy, Waratah Coal, Palmer Industries, Queensland Nickel at Townsville, Palmer Coolum Resort on the Sunshine Coast, Palmer Sea Reef Golf Course at Port Douglas, Palmer Colonial Golf Course at Robina, and the Palmer Gold Coast Golf Course, also at Robina. In April 2012, he announced that he had signed a memorandum of understanding with CSC Jinling Shipyard to construct a replica of RMS Titanic, the Titanic II which will be built in China and will set sail in late 2016.

"The Orange Order has weighed into the Scottish independence debate - denouncing nationalism as 'a divisive and evil enemy' during a march in support of the Union. The Protestant fraternal group, known for its political interventions in Northern Ireland, held a parade through the centre of Edinburgh yesterday. However, the controversial march was disowned by the official anti-independence group, Better Together, following fears that it could stoke sectarian violence. Alistair Darling, leader of the No campaign, said: 'They are nothing to do with us.' Scroll down for video .

Walk: A group of women in white dresses on the Orange Order march . Despite worries about the possibility of unrest at yesterday's 'Proud to be British' march, it passed off largely peacefully as thousands of members showed their devotion to the UK ahead of Thursday's referendum. Marchers gathered to hear speeches by senior figures from around the UK, before setting off past some of Edinburgh's most famous landmarks including the Scottish Parliament and the Palace of Holyroodhouse. In a speech ahead of the march, grand chaplain Henry Williamson said: 'Brothers and sisters, in a world of instability, a world of insecurity, a world of nuclear proliferation, of radical Islam, people look to the UK as a land of hope, a land of peace, of success and unity and an example if what they so desperately long for - unity not stupidity, unity not division, unity not separation, unity not them and us.

He added: 'Let me remind you that when an enemy came against the city of Londonderry, God's people famously said there will be no surrender to this evil enemy. 'It was a cry we made in 1914, it was a cry we made in 1939, it is a cry British people make every time we face an enemy who seek to destroy who and what we are, and a cry that we make on behalf of the underdog. 'Well, a divisive and evil enemy has arisen against Scotland in the guise of false patriotism and the nationalist referendum, against our beloved United Kingdom, and our reply as God's people this time is ""no separation"".'

"Colin Gagich, a developer of Hitchbot, carries Hitchbot in Victoria, Vancouver Island,  Canada . Canada's friendly robot, with his trendy boots and garden gloves, had just one dream: to hitchhike his way across Canada. Many thought he wouldn't make it. The innocent robot, they said, would end up being sold as scrap within days. But Hitchbot has surprised the world by completing his journey from Nova Scotia to British Columbia after hitchhiking 3,700 miles (6,000km) on the open road. The robot, assembled from household items by Dr Frauke Zeller and Professor David Smith, was reunited with its creators at an art gallery in British Columbia. The pair devised the trip to provide insights into how people interact with robots. 'This project turns our fear of technology on its head and asks 'can robots trust humans?',' said Dr Zeller, an assistant professor at Ryerson University. One of Hitchbot's arms is permanently fixed in a hitchhike position, and the droid was able to tweet its thoughts to the general public during his journey. Equipped with GPS, 3G wireless connectivity, a camera, the Hitchbot was also be able to monitor its progress across Canada. Hitchbot gets kissed during an event in Vancouver. The contraption made of a beer cooler, foam tubing and rubber gloves used social media to inform fans on Twitter, Instagram and Facebook about his travels . To keep drivers engaged in conversation, Hitchbot ran social media and Wikipedia application programming interfaces so that it could make small talk . Images and messages posted on Twitter showed the robot, being driven westward across forests, mountains and prairies. It made stops to fish and camp, attended a wedding and even made an appearance at an aboriginal pow wow. 'Our aim is to further discussion in society about our relationship with technology and robots,' said Dr Zeller. To keep drivers engaged in conversation, Hitchbot ran social media and Wikipedia application programming interfaces so that it could make small talk. The droid also has artificial intelligence (AI) systems that allowed it to recognise speech and converse with people it found on its journey.

They picked it up on the border between Alberta and Calgary, where its previous driver was looking to offload it. The child-sized robot is able to stand, making it visible to drivers via a retractable tripod. It made friends throughout its journey across Canada and posted pictures on social media . Hitchbot began its trip in Halifax, Nova Scotia back in July. The journey, courtesy of a host of strangers, has inspired art, clothing and a knock-off made of cardboard and string, dubbed HitchBox . 'It was good fun; we took it out onto the dance floor to, well, do the real robot,' Mr Berry said. 'It was funny because it was a very meticulously planned wedding so I wasn't sure how the bride would react, but she loved it.' Mr Berry said while the couple was giving their speech, the bride thanked the couple's friends for attending, and the robot interrupted, saying, 'I like to make friends.' The journey, courtesy of a host of strangers, has inspired art, clothing and a knock-off made of cardboard and string, dubbed HitchBox.

"They arrived at court together sporting broad grins. But for once the Chuckle Brothers had to be separated so they could give evidence independently in support of Dave Lee Travis. Speaking in broad Yorkshire accents, Barry and Paul Elliott – best known for their BBC children’s show ChuckleVision – dismissed allegations that the former Radio 1 DJ molested a female stage hand at a pantomime in the early 1990s. The comedy duo also denied the suggestion that there was a policy of keeping Travis, 68, away from female cast and crew members because of his reputation with women. Scroll down for video . Sex abuse trial: The Chuckle Brothers, Barry Elliott and Paul Elliott, were giving evidence at Southwark Crown Court today and said they did not remember a sex attack involving DJ Dave Lee Travis when they were in panto . Allegations: One stage hand has accused Travis of groping her during a panto season in Crawley where one of The Chuckle Brothers walked in on them, the court heard . Earlier . in the trial, the Chuckle Brothers were said to have disturbed Travis . as he groped a 21-year-old woman in his dressing room at a theatre in . Crawley, West Sussex, during a six-week production of Aladdin. Yesterday . they told Southwark Crown Court they could not remember the alleged . attack and said they would have been informed if it had taken place. In the panto the Chuckle Brothers played the Chinese policemen while Travis was evil wizard Abanazar. In the witness box Barry, 69, called Travis ‘just a jolly nice chap to work with’. He . said: ‘He was very nice. We did two pantos with him. He was fine. He . was great. I mean everybody seemed to get on. He was just like everybody . else – we used to play cards together sometimes.’ Asked if he remembered Travis ever ‘struggling’ with a young woman in his dressing room, Barry said: ‘I don’t remember that. ‘If it was something serious we probably would, but I don’t remember anything like that at all.’ His . brother Paul, 66, was asked by defence barrister Stephen Vullo if he . recalled any inappropriate behaviour by the former Radio 1 star. Dressing room allegations: A stagehand said Dave Lee Travis, who was playing evil uncle Abanazar in a production of Aladdin (pictured), groped her from 'head to toe' until a Chuckle Brother walked in on him . He . replied: ‘No sorry, I don’t. It is a complete surprise to me. He was . very professional. He seemed to go home straight away after the show . every night and that was it.’ Paul said he had never heard about a formal or informal policy of keeping women away from Travis at the pantomime. ‘I think I would remember,’ he told the court. ‘Nobody told us about it if there was.’ Another . witness, former senior BBC producer David Tate, told the court he had . never heard of any complaint about Travis’s behaviour over the 30 years . he worked with the DJ. Travis, . of Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire, who is being tried under his real name . of Dave Griffin, denies 13 counts of indecent assault and one of sexual . assault. Yesterday morning a female DJ told the jury claims Dave Lee Travis groped a . carnival princess at the opening of a hospital radio station are . 'fantasy'. Evidence: The Chuckle Brothers told the court that Travis was a 'fine man' and did not require a chaperone around women . The woman, . who worked as a presenter at the station in Hertfordshire, said she . watched Travis closely when he appeared as a guest at the launch in the . early 1970s at the time of the alleged incident. She . told jurors at Southwark Crown Court in London it was 'utter nonsense' to suggest Travis became separated from a group of eight people meeting . patients on the hospital's wards. Addressing . the witness, Stephen Vullo, defending Travis, said: 'The jury has heard . from a complainant to suggest he and her separated from this group . while inside the hospital?' The . woman replied: 'He was with his wife the whole time. I was watching . what he was doing the whole time because he was an idol to me. 'It's utter nonsense or fantasy that anything like that happened.' The woman, appearing as a defence . witness, told the court that members of the press at the event wanted . Travis to 'pick up' two carnival princesses at the launch for a . photograph. 'I think I was a little miffed because the press were more interested in the carnival princesses than myself,' she said. The woman, who was 17 at the time, told the court Travis was 'a lovely man' and 'very professional' during his guest appearance. 'He was, he is, a great DJ, an amazing person,' she said. 'It was just really, really exciting to have him come and open the radio station.' The alleged incident is not part of the charges against Travis as he stands trial accused of a series of indecent assaults. The . 68-year-old, from Buckinghamshire, is accused of indecently assaulting . 10 women and sexually assaulting another in incidents dating back to . 1976 and the height of his fame. Appearing . in court under his birth name David Griffin, the alleged offences . occurred when he was working as a BBC DJ, as a broadcaster with Classic . Gold radio, while appearing on Top Of The Pops and when starring in . panto. Meanwhile, an ex-senior BBC producer today said he had never . heard of any complaint about Travis behaving inappropriately towards women in . 30 years of working with him. David Tate, who worked on Radio 1 before moving to the World . Service, also revealed he never heard of a sexual complaint being made against . anyone at the BBC during his long career at the station. Quizzed over his views on Travis, Mr Tate said he did ‘not . recognise the description’ of Travis as a ‘sexual predator’. Asked if he ever saw Travis acting untoward towards women, . he told Southwark Crown Court: ‘Absolutely not. I didn't see anything of that . nature at all, whether it was untoward or inappropriate. ‘I would say that Dave is a very warm, open, friendly person . in my experience. ‘He would come to see us at the World Service once a week . and he might come up to me and give me a hug around the shoulder. ‘That might be inappropriate nowadays but I took that to . mean he is not just a colleague but also a friend.’ Mr Tate, who joined the BBC in the 1960s and worked on . Travis's teatime show on Radio 1, insisted the Corporation would not have . ignored women if they had come forward with allegations at the time. He said: ‘I strongly believe they would be taken seriously, . because in that era the BBC was like a civil service environment. ‘It was very strict, some of the attitudes were very old . fashioned and there were different ways in which things happened at that . organisation. ‘Certainly there were avenues by which if a sexual complaint . had been made it would have been acted upon. ‘The BBC, in my experience, would not shy away from its . responsibilities in respect of where it was required to face up to the . responsibilities of taking action.’ He said comic Kenny Everett was taken off-air after making . inappropriate comments and he believed the BBC would have disciplined other . stars if complaints were made. He said: ‘I honestly think, as an organisation, they would . have faced up if an official complaint had been made.’ Asked by Stephen Vullo, defending, if there were ‘big stars’ at the BBC who would have ‘got away with’ groping women, he said: ‘I honestly . don't think so. Fame: The former Radio 1 presenter is currently on trial for sex offences. He denies 13 indecent assault charges and one sexual assault, dating back to 1976 and the height of his fame. ‘When you work in the environment we were working with all . those people at the time and they were very famous. ‘Some were nice, some weren't. To us they weren't that . special. They were just people. If inappropriate behaviour had been spotted I . think it would have been acted upon.’ He said in the 30 years he has known Travis he ‘never once . came across inappropriate behaviour or heard of any behaviour from Dave Lee . Travis’. Earlier jurors had heard from John Dean, who toured as . Travis' warm-up DJ for 25 years. Mr Dean said Travis would often let female . fans sit on his knee and pose for photos. But he insisted nothing inappropriate ever happened. Describing Travis, he said: ‘Very friendly, he would very . often pose for photos with them with his arm around them. ‘He would sometimes sit down and do his autographs, and they . would sit on his knees and have photographs taken. But there was always a room . full of people. Always.’ Travis denies all the allegations against him. The case was . adjourned until 10am tomorrow morning.

"You might think of Neanderthals as lumbering cavemen who feasted on slaughtered beasts, but new research suggests they preferred far more refined cuisine. A study of ancient fossilised poo left behind by our distant cousins reveals they had a diet which featured vegetables and nuts. The 50,000-year-old samples from Spain are the oldest known Neanderthal faecal matter and  suggest cavemen knew the importance of a varied diet. A study of ancient fossilised poo left behind by Neanderthals reveals they had a varied diet which featured vegetables and nuts, as well as meat . Researchers from Massachusetts Institute of Technology and University of La Laguna in Spain used analytical techniques to find faecal biomarkers from five samples found in El Salt, southern Spain. The scientists analysed each sample for metabolised versions of animal-derived cholesterol, as well as phytosterol, a cholesterol-like compound found in plants. While all samples contained signs of meat consumption, two samples showed traces of plants - the first direct evidence that Neanderthals may have enjoyed omnivorous meals. ‘We have passed through different phases in our interpretation of Neanderthals,’ says Ainara Sistiaga, a graduate student at the University of La Laguna who led the analysis. While all poo samples contained signs of meat consumption, two samples showed traces of plants - the first direct evidence that Neanderthals may have enjoyed an omnivorous diet . Researchers from Massachusetts Institute of Technology and University of La Laguna in Spain used analytical techniques to find faecal biomarkers from five samples found in El Salt, southern Spain . ‘It's important to understand all aspects of why humanity has come to dominate the planet the way it does,’ adds co-author Roger Summons, a professor of geobiology. ‘A lot of that has to do with improved nutrition over time.’ Researchers recently identified plant microfossils trapped in Neanderthal teeth (pictured) While scientists have attempted to reconstruct the Neanderthal diet before, much of the evidence has been inconclusive. For example, researchers have analysed bone fragments for carbon and nitrogen isotopes - signs that Neanderthals may have consumed certain prey, such as pigs versus cows. But these studies could only differentiate between protein sources - underestimating plant intake, and depicting the Neanderthal as exclusively carnivorous. Other researchers recently found plant microfossils trapped in Neanderthal teeth - a finding that suggests the species may have led a more complex lifestyle, harvesting and cooking a variety of plants in addition to hunting prey. However, Ms Sistiaga says it is also possible that Neanderthals didn't eat plants directly, but consumed them through the stomach contents of their prey, leaving traces of plants in their teeth. Equally likely, she says, is another scenario: ‘Sometimes in prehistoric societies, they used their teeth as tools, biting plants, among other things. ‘We can't assume they were actually eating the plants based on finding microfossils in their teeth.’ The researchers believe that while Neanderthals had a mostly meat-based diet, they may have also consumed a fairly regular portion of plants, such as tubers, berries, and nuts. ‘We believe Neanderthals probably ate what was available in different situations, seasons, and climates,’ Ms Sistiaga added. Skulls reveal how cavemen used teeth as a third hand . The biggest collection of ancient human fossils ever recovered from one site is causing scientists to reconsider the path of human evolution. They reveal how Neanderthals, our sister species, developed their distinctive teeth before their brains, using them as a third hand for holding objects. Last week, a new study added to theories that the Neanderthals evolved their characteristic looks slowly, and intermittently, over hundreds of thousands of years. The ancient skulls, dating back 400,000 years, show Neanderthal-like features in the face and teeth, while other parts of the skulls, including the brain case, resembled those of more primitive human ancestors. This suggests the earliest Neanderthals used their jaws in a particular way for chewing as well as for holding objects. The discovery at the Sima de los Huesos site in Spain's Atapuerca Mountains has allowed scientists to better understand pre-human evolution during the Middle Pleistocene period - a time in which the path of hominin evolution has been controversial and fiercely debated. Juan-Luis Arsuaga, a paleontologist at the Complutense University of Madrid, claims the findings were consistent with a 'Game of Thrones' evolutionary saga. In this scenario communities of humans, equivalent to 'houses' in the sci-fi series, would compete for habitable areas more than 400,000 years ago.","Scientists analysed ancient poo samples at El Salt site in southern Spain .

"The famous voices behind the characters Bart and Lisa Simpson, Chief Wiggum and son Ralph, bartender Moe and Apu from Kwik-E-Mart celebrated 25 years of the show at the Hollywood Bowl. The star-studded event called 'The Simpsons Take the Bowl' took place in California on Friday. It featured Nancy Cartwright, Yeardley Smith and Hank Azaria, the voices behind The Simpsons characters along with a host of music, stars and flashbacks from TV's longest-running scripted show. Choir: The orchestra, led by conductor Thomas Wilkins in a Homer Simpson costume, performs at the legendary concert venue . Hollywood Bowl: The cast of The Simpsons perform at the Simpsons Take The Bowl, which took place at the Hollywood Bowl in Hollywood, California on Friday, September 12, 2014 . D' oh: This photo released by the Twentieth Century Fox Film Corporation shows The Simpsons art by Matt Groening . Several members of The Hollywood Bowl Orchestra wore tall blue Marge Simpson wigs and performed classic clips from the show's past 25 seasons played on big screens above them. The 26th season of The Simpsons begins on September 28. To celebrate, legendary alternative pop star Weird Al Yankovic sang 'Oh yeah, The Simpsons will go on, long after the human race is gone.' He also performed a little ditty about Homer and Marge to the tune of John Mellencamp's Jack and Diane. Other guests who appeared during the two-hour program included show creator Matt Groening, former Simpsons writer Conan O'Brien, comedian Jon Lovitz, pro skateboarder Tony Hawk and Oscar-winning composer Hans Zimmer. Zimmer, wearing a jacket covered with Bart faces, performed the music he composed for the Oscar-nominated short film The Longest Daycare, which shows how Maggie saves a butterfly from a classroom bully. Stars: Yeardley Smith, Hank Azaria and Nancy Cartwright delighted the crowd with their performance . At least 60 members of the Gay Men's Chorus of Los Angeles filled the stage for a soaring rendition of Spider Pig, the song Homer dedicated to his special pet pig in The Simpsons Movie. Then chorus members stripped off their robes to reveal sequined vests as they sang the Mr. Burns' song about wearing puppy fur, See My Vest, which culminated with a Rockettes-style kick line. Azaria embodied several of the Simpsons characters he brings to life with his voice, including Moe and Apu, Disco Stu, Professor Frink and Duff Man. While portraying the beer-boasting Duff Man, a group of women dressed as Duff cheerleaders came onstage and fired T-shirt cannons into the crowd. Funny man: Conan O'Brien performs The Monorail Song at the event where he was just one of many stars who celebrated TV's longest-running scripted show . Meanwhile, Lovitz offered a tribute to the late Phil Hartman, a Simpsons regular who voiced various characters on the show until his death in 1998. The entire Hollywood Bowl was Simpson-ified for the program, which continued on Saturday and Sunday night. Plastic doughnuts dangled above concertgoers' heads and life-sized cardboard cutouts of show characters were scattered throughout the venue. New Simpsons animations were created just for the concert, including a peek at the Simpson family arriving at the Hollywood Bowl and Homer trying to resist pushing the fireworks button. Another bit showed Maggie launching the fireworks, and with that, pyrotechnics exploded above the famous Bowl shell.

States like Minnesota, Pennsylvania, Colorado, Nevada, Florida, and Wisconsin are perfect places to live if one isn't quite making six figures. However in states like Hawaii, Washington D.C., New York, Alaska, New Jersey, California, and Connecticut the cost of living comfortably exceeds the $75,000 benchmark. USA Today reports that in Hawaii, to live comfortably one must make a salary of over $122,000.

"A weekend fight allegedly involving nearly every member of the Sarah Palin's family was actually started by her daughter' ex-boyfriend, according to a source close to the family. It had been reported that the drunken brawl erupted when the Palin pack apparently had a run-in with Connor Cleary, an ex-boyfriend of Willow, 20, on Saturday night in South Anchorage, Alaska. But a source from the Palin side is now claiming it began when Cleary 'tried to get in' to the Hummer limousine after he had engaged in some unspecified 'questionable behavior.' A weekend fight involving nearly every member of the Sarah Palin's (left)  family was actually started by her daughter' ex-boyfriend Connor Cleary (right) according to a source close to the family . It had been reported that the drunken brawl started when the Palin pack apparently had a run-in with Connor Cleary, an ex-boyfriend of Willow, 20. Pictured: The Palins in 2007 . The former vice-presidential candidate has not commented publicly on the episode, but RealClearPolitics spoke with a source close to the Palin family, who wanted to provide their version of the events in question. The source said oldest son Track, 25, soon found himself struggling against four men who had 'piled on him.' That was when father Todd Palin - who was celebrating his fiftieth that night, although it was not his party- became involved. Partygoer Eric Thompson told Good Morning America, 'I heard Sarah Palin scream out, ""You know who we are, don’t you?""' But the source told the website Palin was shouting: 'Don't you know who he is? He's a vet!' Husband Todd Palin - who was celebrating his fiftieth that night although it was not his party- became involved in the brawl after his son was allegedly attacked . Her son Track served with the U.S. Army service in the Iraq War. According to the source, Track left the fight nursing four cracked ribs, while his father suffered a bloody nose. Several local sources reported on the incident, initially scooped by Alaska political blogger Amanda Coyne. She wrote: 'Word is that Bristol has a particularly strong right hook, which she employed repeatedly.' But the source said that Bristol is left-handed. One report suggested host Korey Klingenmeyer was allegedly punched in the face seven times by Bristol when he politely asked her to leave the party. Another report claimed that Willow and Bristol apparently tried to go after the mother of Willow's ex-boyfriend. The fight involved 'roughly 20 people' and alcohol is believed to have been a factor in the incident, which took place around 11pm on Saturday night, The Anchorage Police Department said.

"They were meant to be among the finishing touches designed to make a new hotel look more appealing to customers. But instead, attempts to brighten up the area around a new Premier Inn hotel in Woking with carefully groomed plants have left locals 'in stitches'. The phallic-looking topiary sandwiched between two spherical bay trees raised a few eyebrows among local residents and workers who pointed out that they looked like erect penises. Toned down: The topiary was given a bit of a makeover by workers who removed the spherical bushes from the soil . One amused Woking resident, who sent pictures of the plants to the GetSurrey website, said: 'The bushes recently installed at Premier Inn's new building in Woking on Church Street West... has us all in stitches.' Phallic: These plants placed outside a new hotel in Woking, Surrey, raised eyebrows among local residents . The unusual foliage also caused a bit of a stir on Twitter, with most seeing the funny side. Janet Mozelewski posted : 'The landscape gardener clearly had a wicked sense of humour.' But some were more concerned about declining standards of British topiary. Louise Morales added: 'There used to be a time when #topiary took a little skill, so is this the state of #horticulture in the UK?' But when the embarrassing issue was raised with Premier Inn staff, the bushes were given a trim. Although part of the plants remains, the spherical trees at its base have since been given the snip and have been removed by workmen. A spokesperson for the hotel chain said: 'It turns out the plants were actually not part of Premier Inn at all but were owned by the developers, so [they] were not our responsibility and they have now moved them. 'We cannot comment on this as they were not ours.'","The phallic plants were put outside a new hotel in Woking, Surrey .

"The heritage-listed Engineers' Arms Hotel of Maryborough in south-east Queensland is one of the oldest and most distinctive hotels in town with a wonderful apartment currently on the market. Situated in the heart of Maryborough and just 250 kilometres from Brisbane or 37 kilometres from Harvey Bay and Fraser Island, the Engineers Arms presents a great lifestyle opportunity. After a significant refurbishment, the iconic building has operated as a boarding house, restaurant, community hall, candy shop and a bed and breakfast since ceasing operations in 1951. But a hauntingly sad yet historic tale, believed to have haunted the Dillane family who had just moved into a beautiful newly formed location on March Street of Maryborough in 1870. Situated in the heart of Maryborough, the Engineers' Arms Hotel in south-east Queensland is one of the oldest and most distinctive hotels in town with a wonderful apartment currently on the market . Irish immigrants Thomas Dillane and his wife Anne Dunne were newly-weds who were starting a family in their new town. Shortly after, the pair took up the leasehold on the first Engineers Arms Hotel to run their own business. The married couple welcomed their three sons Patrick James, Michael Joseph, and Thomas David but sadly lost their infant Thomas David at eight months after complications caused by teething just a few years after they opened the original hotel in 1870. They welcomed their first daughter Margaret Mary in 1876 but tragedy struck once more when Thomas passed away in September 1877 from consumption at the age of 45. With extensive renovation of the first floor apartment and rooms open to the wrap around verandah, the en-suite bedroom has a walk-in robe, dressing room and a fully renovated bathroom . A delightful blend of 1800's with every modern touch; done with a great eye for detail and respect for history . With her husband gone, Anne struggled to raise her family alone so she put the hotel on lease and took over as head of household before her eldest son, Patrick died after his heart stopped at the age of 17. Anne couldn't handle the death around her family so she packed her bags and boarded a ship to Dublin, Ireland with her remaining children, Michael and Margaret to start a new life, putting the family tragedy behind. But within one month, her daughter Margaret passed away and Anne and Michael returned to Maryborough and took their bar back in 1891. The kitchen is open plan to the dining area and is a delight with a completely new fit-out, including a walk-in pantry and internal laundry . The apartment boasts a wonderful entry through an internal staircase, which connects to a central corridor to the large entertainment and living area . With extensive renovation, the apartment comes with a modern touch, including new electrical wiring, paintwork and floor coverings . Maryborough suffered its worst flood in history in 1893 when it rose over 12 metres and the water engulfed the hotel where they later found Anne's body. With Michael left, unfortunately, he died a year later at the age of 22 from kidney disease. Despite the unfortunate lives of the Dillane family, the property has beautifully maintained so much of its fine details of the building dating back to the 1870s. The apartment is positioned above five separate tenancies, including fashion, cafe restaurant, hairdresser and a boutique liquor store that will deliver a great investment in return. The hotel is built to the property boundary of an acute angled block, giving it a V-shaped plan, truncated at the corner.

"When Texas toddler Natalie Newton slipped in a pool and suffered severe brain damage doctors were unable to save her, or provide a humane way to end her suffering. With no way to revive Natalie, known as Natty to her family, all the hospital was able to do was to withhold nutrition. The family of the 21-month-old girl had to watch helplessly as she starved to death over nine days, . and they are now campaigning to make euthanasia legal in the state. Painful loss: Natalie Newton, known as Natty, was left with a brain injury after falling in a pool . Traumatic: When doctors couldn't save Natty her feeding tube was removed to allow her to die . Natty was 19 months old when she stumbled into a pool at the family home last year, and suffered an anoxic brain injury. The hospital that treated her tried an experimental treatment to revive the little girl, but although she survived the procedure she was left blind, deaf, paralyzed and suffering from seizures. She managed to recover from some of the symptoms over the next month, but she was given only a 4 per cent chance of surviving the year. With her suffering more seizures, organ failure and other complications, the hospital's Ethics Committee ruled that End of Life was the most humane course for Natty. However, the only way that can be carried out in Texas is by removing life support or, as the Newton family said: 'Essentially, if we wanted to put a stop to her suffering, we would had to starve her to death.' Devastating: Natty's mother and family are mourning the loss of their beautiful baby . Heartbreaking: The happy and healthy little girl wasted away before her family's eyes . The ethics committee at Corpus Christi Hospital recommended End of Life was the best option for Natty . 'I had no idea, no idea, what my family was about to endure,' Natty's grandfather, Bradley Newton, told ABC 7. 'It was just horrible. Blind and deaf and can't move.' In Texas euthanasia is illegal but the Newton family believe those in a similar situation to what they faced should be given some choice. Mr Newton told Click2Houston the nine days of suffering Natty endured could have been replaced with 30 seconds of a medically-induced, less painful death. 'It should be right to choose to let them go quickly and peacefully,' he said. The family were so traumatized by watching their beautiful little girl wither away over nine agonizing days, that they are campaigning to make what is already a heartbreaking situation more dignified for others. 'We euthanize dogs for humanity . reasons, we euthanize serial killers but, a 21-month old baby has to . starve for almost nine days,' Mr Newton said. Campaign: A foundation has been set up in Natalie's name to campaign for euthanasia laws to change . Call for change: Brad Newton is campaigning to change the law in Texas after watching his granddaughter's painfully slow death . The family are raising awareness for . the Campaign For Dignity in Dying, which proposes legalizing assisted . dying in certain cases. On . the family's The Natty Foundation website they blamed the current . 'barbaric law' for 'forcing tens of thousands of Americans every single . year to choose between insufferable agony or the undignified sadness of . starvation'. The process of . ending a terminally ill patient's life by removing their feeding tube . is said to be humane, but the Newtons said it was a harrowing . experience. Natty lost half her body weight and became increasingly delirious. She became 'nothing but a shell of the little girl, that a few short months ago, filled our lives with laughter and happiness,' her family said. But neurologist Sarah Austin, who works with terminal patients, said legalizing euthanasia could be a slippery slope. 'When do you decide that this is the right time to hasten their death? ...  I think you do better to allow that process to go on naturally and make people comfortable in the process,' she said.","Natalie Newton was left blind, deaf and paralyzed from severe brain injury .

"You have to admire Brendan Rodgers. Not only is he facing the challenge of trying to improve Liverpool without Luis Suarez, he has set himself another challenge by signing Mario Balotelli. The Italy forward is at times brilliant, and other times impossible. One thing is for certain so far in his career though: there is a consistent pattern to Balotelli’s behaviour - when things are going well, he’ll be fine. If times are difficult, he could be a liability. His best spell at City came during a run in 2011 when they were on a nine-game winning streak which included their 6-1 victory at Old Trafford. Balotelli scored six goals in five games in that period. Liability? Mario Balotelli, seen here watching Liverpool's match at his former club Manchester City on Monday, poses a unique set of challenges for Brendan Rodgers . Back in England: Balotelli has joined Liverpool from Milan for £16m . Unpredictable: Balotelli can be fantastic and frustrating in equal measure. He is pictured showing off his famous 'Why Always Me?' t-shirt in Manchester City's 6-1 win at Man United in 2011 . But later that season, when Mancini needed his prodigal son to deliver at Arsenal, City lost 1-0, fell eight points off the pace at the top, and Balotelli committed two horrible challenges to get himself sent off. Mancini was a sad sorry sight trying to persuade his striker to leave the field when he was reluctant to go. With Balotelli suspended, City went on a winning run to seal the title. And with things going so well, of course, the Italian was happy to help out, laying on that sensational winning goal from Sergio Aguero against QPR in injury time – Balotelli’s only assist during his time with City. It was the only time he featured during that winning streak. Mario’s a player who let Mancini down badly, and the former Man City boss was Balotelli’s father figure, the manager who trusted him and supported him more than any other. If Mario is prepared to do that to his father-figure, then good luck Brendan. A bad challenge on a team-mate at the City training ground led to Mancini and Balotelli having a scuffle in front of photographers, and the player was sold a month later. Witnesses described the challenge as 'horrific' and 'seemingly pre-meditated.' It wasn’t the first time he had clashed with a colleague at the training ground. Flashpoint: Balotelli clashed with 'father-figure' Roberto Mancini on the training ground back in January 2013 . Red mist: Balotelli is shown a red card by referee Martin Atkinson during a match with Arsenal in April 2012 . Work cut out: Brendan Rodgers could have a difficult task in keeping Balotelli on the straight and narrow . Red cards and bans at City were too frequent. Reckless challenges on Dynamo Kiev’s Goran Popov in the Champions League, West Brom’s Youssouf Mulumbu and Arsenal’s Alex Song in the Premier League. Oh, and he got a four-match ban for stamping on Scott Parker’s head. Maybe Mario has changed but there is no evidence of that. AC Milan had grown tired of the problems he created – he was banned for three games for insulting an opponent and a referee AFTER the final whistle when Milan were beaten by Napoli. And towards the end of last season, Balotelli clashed with journalists and turned himself into a victim who claimed he was being attacked by half of Italy. This is the kind of nonsense that can affect a player’s game, and certainly affects Balotelli. Inconsistency in his behaviour and performance (I’m not even talking about controversy away from football) is Balotelli’s trademark. At Euro 2012 he looked sensational; when Italy were knocked out of the World Cup this summer he was booked for dissent and substituted at half time. Power-packed: Balotelli drills home his second goal for Italy against Germany in the Euro 2012 semi-final . Ripped: And celebrates in his own inimitable style . Sub-par: But Balotelli was unable to repeat that form at the 2014 World Cup in Brazil . Balotelli could be a reformed character. Rodgers might be the manager Mario has been searching for. Neither of those things are certain though, so that’s why the signing is a risk. People have told me there is no downside to the Balotelli signing. Really? Sounds like people trying to convince themselves it’s a great bit of business. What if he decides to launch another 'horrific' challenge in training on a team-mate? Or if he feels the urge to throw a dart at a youth team player as he did at City? What if he is still one of the worst trainers football has ever seen – what kind of example does that set to some of the youngsters currently working hard for Rodgers? It could all mean a lot of time spent on managing one individual player, when I’m sure Rodgers could spend that time more profitably doing other things. Based on his career so far, Balotelli will be a great signing – but only when things are going well. He’s got it all to prove. From what we saw from him at Man City, how do you think he would have reacted had he been part of the Liverpool team that were well beaten in the end at the Etihad on Monday night? For Liverpool’s sake, I hope Balotelli has grown up. If he hasn’t, it could be a big blemish on Rodgers’ so far excellent CV.","Brendan Rodgers has taken a brave step in bringing Mario Balotelli from Milan to Liverpool in a £16m deal .

"Madonna was today threatened with legal action and accused of being an ageing self-publicist after she depicted the head of one of France’s biggest political parties as a Nazi. An image of National Front leader Marine Le Pen  with a swastika on her forehead appeared on a giant screen at the singer's concert in Tel Aviv, Israel on Thursday. The furious politician has threatened to sue Madonna if she repeats the stunt when her tour reaches France in July. Swastika: Marine Le Pen's image appeared on a giant screen, with the Nazi symbol on her forehead . Ms Le Pen said: 'We understand how old singers who need to get . people talking about them go to such extremes.’ Asked if she was likely . to sue, Ms Le Pen, 43, said: ‘If she does that in France, we’ll be . waiting’. Madonna, who will turn 54 in August, is due in France next month, when she will appear at the Stade de France in Paris and then in Nice on the Riviera. Other sources in the National Front, which has frequently been linked with anti-Semitism and racism, said Madonna had offended all of its members. ‘We are not a Nazi party, and object to being depicted as such,’ said a source in the party, which won a fifth of the popular vote during the first round of presidential elections in April. Controversy: Madonna, onstage in Tel Aviv, Israel, on May 31 . ‘If you accuse the National Front of . being anti-Semitic and racist then you accuse a fifth of the French . people of being anti-Semitic and racist. 'If Madonna repeats this slur in . France then she will certainly be taken to court.’ Wallerand de . Saint-Just, the National Front’s lawyer, confirmed he was looking into . the possibility of legal action. Marine Le Pen pledged to reform the party after taking over the leadership from her notorious father, Jean-Marie Le Pen last year. He is a convicted racist and anti-Semite who has in the past denied that the Nazi Holocaust actually took place during World War II. Despite this, he came runner-up in the French presidential election in 2002, proving that he had widespread support. Ms Le Pen has toned down the party’s extremist views, but regularly pledges to limit Muslim immigration, and to clamp down on Islamic culture in France. Madonna’s depiction of Ms Le Pen appeared as she performed her song ‘Nobody Knows Me’ in Tel Aviv last Thursday. The international superstar is well known for her provocative acts, and is currently dating a Frenchman called Brahim Zaibat who has a North African Muslim immigrant background. Ms Le Pen won just under 18 per cent of votes in the presidential election and is currently standing to become an MP in France’s National Assembly .","Le Pen's face appeared on a giant screen with a swastika on her forehead .

"England's footballers have yet to get back on track with the public after their woeful World Cup but at least Virgin Trains are prepared to go out of their way for Roy Hodgson’s squad. Travellers  from London Euston to Manchester who had booked first-class seats in the two most convenient carriages, were surprised to be relocated because of a block booking. Then the service stopped unexpectedly at Watford for the England party, who were on the way to a rare training stay at St George’s Park in Staffordshire, to board. They later disembarked at Lichfield Trent Valley, another unscheduled port of call. The train announcer made no apology for running 12 minutes late due to looking after England’s needs. The FA said fans would approve of England travelling on public transport and it was an issue for Virgin where the train stopped. Time: Virgin experienced delays to their service as one of their trains made extra stops for the England squad . A Virgin spokesman said: ‘We try to accommodate the requirements of the England team when we can and we don’t broadcast when they travel with us for security reasons. We apologise if any of our customers were inconvenienced.’ lncreasingly irrational talkSport pundit Stan Collymore seems to have got the wrong message from BBC approaches last May as to whether he would be available for Match of the Day 2 duties this season. Collymore announced it as a job offer, saying he received a ‘welcome aboard’ tweet from Gary Lineker. However the BBC confirmed yesterday that Collymore was only one of many being sounded out and that they have no current plans to use him on MotD programmes. Captain: The PCA came out in support of Alastair Cook saying: 'Don't sack him - back him' Eyebrows were raised around the cricket circuit after the Professional Cricketers Association, who look after all members of the players union, gave strong public support to England’s beleaguered one-day captain Alastair Cook. The PCA posted a number of tweets with the hashtag ‘Don’t sack him — BACK him’ detailing why Cook should remain at the helm of the 50-over side despite their dismal run of results. The campaign had the endorsement of PCA chief executive Angus Porter, who said: ‘We historically back the incumbent captain and we wanted to demonstrate that with Alastair having had such a difficult summer. We don’t feel it is inappropriate.’ There is understood to be further tension at Sky Sports News in the fall-out from their pantomime deadline day coverage. Newcomer Kate Abdo was chosen to work alongside Jim White and Natalie Sawyer on the flagship programme, which is believed to have upset some of the established presenters. Verdict: Trevor Brookingwill address the background to Harry Redknapp replacing Billy Bonds at West Ham . Sir Trevor Brooking, famous for sitting on the fence as a pundit, will nevertheless address the background to Harry Redknapp replacing Billy Bonds as West Ham manager in 1994 in his updated autobiography to be published this month. Rather than give an opinion, Brooking details the events surrounding the sensitive change. Sir Trevor is a close friend of Bonds and has always taken his side. Indeed, there are those who believe his presence at the FA would have made it very difficult for Redknapp to become England manager. Brooking, now retired, glowingly described Bonds in the Wembley programme this week as ‘a colossus, a top, top man and an absolute leader.’ Wembley:  England vs Norway was watched by fewer people on television and at Wembley . The FA sadly will not throw the book at referee grandee David Elleray for making a ghastly racist comment. But window-dressing anti-discrimination initiatives to help black players and others from ethnic minority backgrounds develop careers after football will see former Huddersfield forward Iffy Onuora observe FA board meetings and Les Ferdinand attend the Wembley Stadium ones. Wednesday's non-event against Norway, watched by the new Wembley’s lowest crowd for an England international, did however attract a reasonable peak viewing audience of 5.6m on ITV, although the 4.5m average was 1m down on recent friendlies. ITV, with exclusive rights to all England’s games until November 2017, should have concerns if ratings for next Monday’s European Championship qualifier in Switzerland — the most attractive game of the group — are not considerably higher.","Roy Hodgson and England squad caused delays on Virgin train .

"Signing superstars for loads of money is easy, but Louis van Gaal also knows how to upset Manchester United fans, that’s for sure. The Old Trafford faithful – the true United fans - love Danny Welbeck, and not just because he is a Manchester lad. I can imagine Sir Alex Ferguson feeling sick to the pit of his stomach that one of his favorites has joined Arsenal. He would probably take it as a personal insult, but he shouldn’t. I’ll explain why later. I like Welbeck. Very few players at United in recent years have sacrificed themselves so much for the team as he has. VIDEO Scroll down for Arsenal signing Danny Welbeck takes part in a Q&A with Rooney . Team player: Man United's loss is Arsenal's gain as Danny Welbeck swapped Old Trafford for the Emirates . Teammates: Welbeck will link up with Jack Wilshere and his new Arsenal teammates after the internationals . If you’re one of those people who simple adds up a tally of goals and decides if a player is good or not then Welbeck isn’t for you. But if you analyse the game with more depth, then you see the worth of Welbeck. Sir Alex Ferguson admits in his book that he ‘used’ the striker for a variety of different roles in the team, and that policy had a detrimental effect on Welbeck’s goals total. The shirt fits: Danny Welbeck in his new shirt after the club sealed a £16m deal . Got your number: Welbeck shows off his new No 23 Gunners shirt . Fergie knew he could trust him to do a job for the team, whether it was as a striker, or on the left, or even closing down Real Madrid’s Xabi Alonso in the Champions League, a job Welbeck did to perfection, until a ridiculous red card for Nani ruined Sir Alex’s final European campaign. As a professional, Welbeck is exemplary. If you want someone to do a job and sacrifice himself for the team, he is the man. He’s full of self-belief too, which is no bad thing. Big game player: Welbeck scored some key goals for United - including one against Real Madrid . Sacrificing himself: Welbeck put the team first rather than personal glory . He’s not fazed by the big occasion – United fans remember his goal at the Bernebeu fondly, and he scored a wonderful back-heeled goal for England in the win over Sweden at Euro 2012. In the Premier League he has scored goals in victories over Manchester City, Chelsea and Arsenal – big goals in big games. He’s strong, quick and he can finish. Now it is Arsene Wenger’s job to turn him into the goalscoring striker he needs, the player Ferguson always felt Welbeck could be. International star: Welbeck has proved to be a key player for England . Taking advantage: Arsene Wenger can finish the job Sir Alex Ferguson started with Welbeck . He has it in him to be an absolute beast for the Gunners. I sincerely hope from an England point of view Welbeck seizes the chance. And there’s a bigger significance in this transfer. Signing an English player, nurtured and developed through the ranks at Manchester United is Wenger’s way of tipping his ‘chapeau’ to the greatness of Ferguson. It’s an admission that Wenger knows that despite coming close, the Arsenal manager can never emerge from Fergie’s enormous shadow. With Welbeck, Wenger is trying to complete a job started by Ferguson. The Arsenal boss is trying to pay the greatest tribute to his former rival. Let’s see how that goes. VIDEO Deal or no deal?

They are players who have chosen to pick up money training all week, without the special feeling of playing in front of thousands of fans who have handed over heard-earned cash to watch them play. They are players who make you lose the faith in the beautiful game in this modern era. Borini’s conduct has been bizarre at best. He was loved by Sunderland fans – guaranteed hero status after scoring a late winner in the North East derby at the Stadium of Light and getting the first when the Mackems hammered the Toon 3-0 at St James’ Park a few months later. The club, the manager and the fans all wanted him to sign for Sunderland. It was all agreed, it was a no-brainer. Except someone with no brains decided it would be a good idea to get greedy and see if more money could be had at QPR. Cult status: Borini became a hero at Sunderland during his loan spell at the club last season . Thankfully for Rangers, chairman Tony Fernandes has wised up to players and advisers taking his pants down so Borini was sent packing. Niko Kranjcar, meanwhile, took a 66 per cent pay cut to re-join Harry Redknapp at Loftus Road. Aston Villa wanted Cleverley. No hang on, Manchester United legend Roy Keane, the kind of player - on his day - that Cleverley only wishes he could be, wanted him at Villa Park. Yet those talks ended up with Villa ‘unhappy’, Cleverley out of the door, and the deal off. Minutes later Everton said no, and Cleverley is left at Manchester United under a manager who was quite happy to let him go. All smiles: Niko Kranjcar was more than happy to take a large paycut to re-join Harry Redknapp at QPR . I’m told Cleverley wants to play football. I’m left asking, ‘How much?’ Cleverley should be paying Keane for the education he would have received under him at Villa. To learn from Keane should have been his priority, regardless of wages, and regardless of Everton stepping in late on. I still believe in the soul of football, I still believe most players love the game and playing more than they love money. But I also know there will be one or two players who let themselves down and forget that time of innocence when they were young boys who felt the joy and excitement of kicking a football. Those guys are much poorer for losing that special feeling this beautiful game can bring.","Tom Cleverley and Fabio Borini should put playing before money .

"Lord Dannatt, former head of the British Army, said a vote for independence would be 'letting down' Scottish soldiers who gave their lives preserving the United Kingdom . Scroll down for video . A former head of the British Army has said he fears a Yes vote in the Scottish referendum could be 'letting down' Scottish soldiers who died during fighting in Northern Ireland. Lord Dannatt, who was chief of the general staff between 2006 and 2009, made a personal plea to Scots for a No vote, stating more than 100 Scottish members of the armed forces had fought and died defending the UK during the Troubles. He said: 'Do the families of Scottish soldiers who lost their lives between 1969 and 2007 to preserve the territorial integrity of the United Kingdom now just say, ""Well, it no longer matters""? 'I cannot speak for them, but I wonder just how much thought, appreciation and recognition is given to the memory of those who have fought and brought this United Kingdom of ours to where it is today, and where it could be in the future. 'And I really worry on behalf of the wives, mothers and friends of those Scottish soldiers who died to keep Northern Ireland in the United Kingdom. 'I worry particularly about the extent that we will be letting them down if Scotland disappears from our country, just on the whim of a few thousand voters willing to gamble on an uncertain future rather than staying within the United Kingdom, whose track record is second to none in Europe.' Lord Dannatt added in the Sunday Telegraph that he felt defence was the 'weakest link' for an independent Scotland. It comes after a host of senior military figures have raised concerns about independence in relation to the country's defences in the months leading up to the crucial vote, with former Nato commander General Sir Richard Shirreff even branding it 'dangerous'. But Angus Robertson, the SNP's defence spokesman, responded: 'A dangerous and amateurish defence policy would be one that sent troops into an illegal war without proper equipment, while wasting tens of billions of pounds on Trident nuclear weapons that can never be used - that's the UK.' Shadow foreign secretary Douglas Alexander dismissed the remarks. 'I am unyielding in my admiration and respect for the men and women of the British armed forces and the contribution that Scots have played and continue to play in those forces,' he told Sky News Murnaghan programme. 'But many British soldiers have given their lives over the years to defeat fascism and then to defend democracy and let's be absolutely . clear: what we are witnessing here in Scotland on Thursday is an exercise in democracy. 'So I hold no brief for Lord Dannatt this morning.' Scottish Deputy First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said the former military chief's comments 'bordered on being offensive and insulting'. 'There are mixed opinions across the armed forces as there are across Scottish society.' Veterans of the Black Watch wearing combat armbands as a mark of respect to comrades who have lost their lives in in Iraq during a Remembrance service at the Cenotaph in Whitehall (file picture) Deputy First Minister Nicola Sturgeon, seen here on the campaign trail with Alex Salmond, said Lord Dannatt's comments were 'offensive and insulting' Lord Dannatt's intervention comes after five former First Sea Lords warmed that a yes vote in the Scottish referendum would do ‘immense damage’ to Britain’s armed forces. In a letter to the Daily Telegraph, Adml Sir Mark Stanhope, Adml Sir Jonathon Band, Adml Lord West, Adml Lord Boyce, Adml Sir Jock Slater and Vice Adml John McAnally, the president of The Royal Naval Association, said splitting the union would be seen as an ‘act of destruction’ and Scotland might struggle to recruit soldiers. The latest warning follows a string of similar cautions from senior serving and former members of the Armed Forces that independence risks damaging national security for both England and Scotland. They wrote that the ‘grave implications’ of splitting the UK in two in terms of security and employment related to defence had not been spelt out to voters. Jobs would be lost at Faslane and at Scotstoun and Govan, under a split, the letter predicts. Orders for 13 new Royal Navy frigates may well not be placed in an independent Scotland.","Lord Dannatt, who was chief of general staff between 2006 and 2009, urged Scots to vote No .

"Most people have imagined what it would must be like to live as a king or queen for the day. So it is perhaps surprising that when it comes to experiencing the utmost in opulence and luxury, a stay in Buckingham Palace doesn't quite cut it for the majority of Brits. Instead, the most desired location to spend a night was deemed to be Sir Richard Branson's Caribbean paradise, Necker Island. Sir Richard Branson's 74-acre Caribbean paradise Necker Island was deemed the most desired location . The 74-acre island house came top in a nationwide survey of 2,500 Brits who were asked which celebrity property they would most like to stay in. Buckingham Palace, the official London residence of the Queen, came second in the poll, which was conducted by accommodation website Airbnb. It came in front of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge's sprawling Norfolk estate, Anmer Hall. David and Victoria Beckham's £25m west London mansion, dubbed the new 'Beckingham Palace' after they sold their grand Hertfordshire mansion earlier this year, came fourth, while Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt's luxury Los Angeles home came in fifth place. Sir Richard's holiday home on Necker Island has become a by-word for luxury and has played host to a vast array of A-list celebrities and royalty over the years . The celebrity homes that Brits least want to stay in belong to Miley Cyrus, Tracy Emin, Harry Styles, Cara Delevingne and Justin Bieber. The survey did provide more good news for Victoria Beckham, with the public naming her most popular choice when asked which well-known individual they would most trust to redesign their home. Designers Stella McCartney and Ralph Lauren came second and third on the list ahead of Kelly Hoppen and Terence Conran. However, when it came to naming the high-profile stars we wouldn't want designing our home, Miley Cyrus again topped the list, followed by Lady Gaga, Paris Hilton, Katie Price and Damien Hirst. Buckingham Palace in London has 775 rooms, including 19 State rooms, 52 Royal and guest bedrooms, 188 staff bedrooms, 92 offices and 78 bathrooms . Sir Richard Branson's holiday home on Necker Island has become a by-word for luxury and has played host to a vast array of A-list celebrities over the years. The property was severely damaged in a 2011 fire that devastated the island's Great House. However, it was rebuilt a year later and can now be rented out by guests for a staggering £40,000 per night. The private island house, which Branson has owned since 1979, boasts eight guest rooms, each with a balcony, king-sized bed and en-suite bathroom. A 1,500 square feet master suite sits upstairs that has been specifically designed to give panoramic views of the Caribbean, the Atlantic Ocean and neighbouring islands and includes a two-person Jacuzzi. Anmer Hall is the splendid Norfolk country residence which the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge will move into later this month. The ten-bedroom Georgian mansion was a present from the Queen following their wedding . David and Victoria Beckham have spent an extra £5million renovating their palatial four-storey London mansion which includes a gym and a massage room, as well as an underground garage for David's cars . Victoria Beckham was named as the most popular choice by Britons when asked which celebrity they would most trust to redesign their home . Buckingham Palace has served as the official London residence of Britain's sovereigns since 1837 and today is also the administrative headquarters of the Monarch. Although in use for the many official events and receptions held by The Queen, the State Rooms at Buckingham Palace are open to visitors every year. It has 775 rooms, including 19 State rooms, 52 Royal and guest bedrooms, 188 staff bedrooms, 92 offices and 78 bathrooms. Meanwhile, Anmer Hall is the splendid Norfolk country residence which the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge are expected to move into later this month. The ten-bedroom Georgian mansion was a present from the Queen following their wedding and has undergone a complete refurbishment. It has its own swimming pool and tennis court. It was last year that David and Victoria Beckham splashed out on a palatial London mansion as a replacement for their Hertfordshire estate. The former England football captain and his wife have spent an extra £5million renovating the four-storey period home which includes a gym and a massage room, as well as an underground garage for David's cars. When it comes to living like the stars, the survey found that a home cinema is now the most desirable feature to have, followed by a hot tub and private wine cellar. 'It's perhaps no surprise that the prospect of spending a night on Necker Island is so appealing,' said Airbnb's Nick Wilkins. 'But what the research shows is just how much celebrities inspire people when it comes to design and the home. 'There are over 800,000 unique properties listed on Airbnb across the globe, including many with links to the rich and famous. 'So whether it's staying in Ronaldinho's mansion in Rio, Jimmy Hendrix's Hawaiian retreat or Denzel Washington's California beach house, guests can find accommodation that reflects their own design tastes and style.' Airbnb is a website that allows travellers to book accommodation in other people's homes. The California-based company is collaborating with next week's London Design Festival to allow four leading designers to create their interpretation of the ideal home in London's Trafalgar Square.","A nationwide survey of 2,500 Brits was carried out by Airbnb website .

"Rafael Nadal's US Open participation has been called into question by an injury which will force him to wear a cast on his right wrist for up to three weeks. The world number two won the event last year, beating Novak Djokovic in the final for his 13th major title, to which he has since added this year's French Open. But he faces a tight schedule to be fit for this year's event, which starts on August 25, after suffering an injury which will prevent him also defending his Rogers Cup and Western and Southern Open titles earlier in the month. Problems: Rafa Nadal's wrist injury will keep him out for at least two to three weeks, and possibly longer . Double: Nadal is left handed but his back hand will be affected as it is double-handed . A statement issued by Nadal's representatives read: 'Spanish star Rafa Nadal won't be able to compete and defend his titles from last year in Canada and Cincinnati. 'The player felt some pain during practice in Mallorca getting ready for the North American swing. After some tests today at the Clinica Mapfre de Medicina del Tenis, the doctors found a minor detachment of the posterior cubital tunnel of his right wrist. 'The player must remain for two or three weeks with an immobilisation cast on his right wrist. Depending on the evolution of the injury that will be carefully followed by the doctors, including MRI tests, it will be decided then the return to competition, initially scheduled for the US Open.' Cautious: Nadal's representatives are optimistic about his chances of playing in the Open but can't be certain . Champion: Rafa Nadal won the US Open in 2010 and 2013 and also finished runner-up in 2011 . The cubital tunnel houses the ulnar nerve, which runs from the elbow to the fingers and is colloquially known as the 'funny bone'. Wrist injuries have been commonplace in tennis this season, with men's world number eight Juan Martin del Potro undergoing surgery and Laura Robson falling to fourth in the British women's rankings after a similar issue. While Nadal's injury is to his right wrist, not his dominant hand, his two-handed backhand would still be badly affected.","Rafa Nadal will miss Rodgers Cup and Western and Southern Open .

"After the videotape clicks on, the 53-year-old calmly tells investigators how he choked six-year-old Etan Patz in the basement of a Manhattan convenience store on May 25, 1979. He describes putting the boy, who was still alive, into a plastic bag, then putting the bag inside a box and dumping it nearby. 'I was nervous; my legs were jumping,' Pedro Hernandez said. 'I wanted to let go, but I just couldn't let go. I felt like something just took over me. I don't know what to say. Something just took over me, and I was just choking him.' The tape was played at a hearing Monday to determine whether or not the confession can be used as evidence at Hernandez's murder trial - not whether the statements are true. It was the first time the public could hear Hernandez, who has pleaded not guilty, talk in his own words about the notorious case that plagued police for decades. Taped confession: Pedro Hernandez, who admitted to killing Etan Patz in 1979, in a taped confession appears in Manhattan criminal court with his attorney Harvey Fishbein in 2012 . Judge Maxwell Wiley must decide whether Hernandez was properly advised of his rights and is mentally capable of understanding them. Etan became one of the first missing children to be pictured on a milk carton, and the day he disappeared, May 25, became National Missing Children's Day. His body has never been found. His parents were in court Monday, the first time they have appeared publicly since Hernandez was arrested two years ago. The father, Stan, watched stoically while the boy's mother, Julie, left before the tape began. On the video, Hernandez is dressed in a brown jacket, white T-shirt and jeans, and sits at an empty desk save for a can of Pepsi. He talks about his family and his medical history - he is HIV-positive, suffers back problems and is bipolar. He explains how he killed the child but doesn't remember what the boy was wearing, that Etan had a cap on when he vanished, or that the weather was bad that day. He says he tossed the boy's book bag behind a freezer; no bag was ever found. He doesn't remember the boy saying anything, and nothing in particular caught his attention that made him choose the boy, he says. 1979 crime: Pedro Hernandez has pleaded not guilty to murder in the strangling death of Etan Patz, who was one of the first missing persons to be placed on a milk carton . Distraught: The parents of Etan Patz were in court today, but his mother left the courtroom before the tape was played while his father listen stoically . 'I just approached to him or I asked him, you want a soda? I said come with me,' he said. 'He didn't say nothing to me. He didn't kick. He wasn't angry. He just kind of stood there, and I just felt bad what I did.' Hernandez's lawyer, Harvey Fishbein, argued his client falsely confessed and lacks the mental ability to understand his rights. He described Hernandez' demeanor on camera as exhausted from hours of questioning; Hernandez had been in custody nearly eight hours when the taping began. 'When those eight hours were finished, he was convinced he had something to do with the disappearance of Etan Patz,' Fishbein said. In 2012, police got a lead that brought them to Hernandez, a high school dropout who had worked at a corner store near where Etan disappeared. Hernandez, most recently a resident of Maple Shade, New Jersey, also told police that he confessed before: to his ex-wife, to a friend, and in front of about 15 people during a prayer circle at a church group. No one ever went to authorities. 'We were all holding hands and praying,' he said of the church meeting. 'And everybody was confessing, so I confessed. I told them I killed a child.' The hearing is expected to last several weeks.","A taped confession to killing six-year-old Etan Patz in 1979 by Pedro Hernandez, 53, was played in court today .

"Ryanair could offer low-cost, transatlantic flights within the next five to 10 years, the company's Chief Executive has said. Michael O'Leary admitted there was no chance of the budget airline operating the flights before then, because there is currently a shortage of long-haul aircraft available. But he said he hopes that Ryanair would be able to fly to the US during his time as Chief Executive. Scroll down for video . Ryanair could offer transatlantic flights within the next five to 10 years, the company's Chief Executive has said . 'We've had a business plan ready to roll for a transatlantic, low-fares airline,' he said. 'The difficulty is, I keep cautioning, is that there's no availability of long-haul aircraft for another four or five years. 'So unless we can secure a fleet of low-cost aircraft, frankly, the business doesn't get off the ground. 'The future is very hard to foretell, it certainly is unlikely to happen within the next five years, but I'd be disappointed if it doesn't happen within the period, maybe, five to 10 years.' Ryanair Chief Executive Michael O'Leary has previously said the airline could offer US flights for as little as £8 . Mr O'Leary's comments come after he previously announced in February that the Irish airline could offer passengers flights to the US for as little as £8. The airline intends to offer the cheap flights from between 12 to 14 European cities to the same amount of destinations in America. He told the Irish Hotels Federation conference in Meath that Ryanair would offer the €10 (£8.21) flights to Boston and New York. Flights back to Europe from the US would cost £6. However, he admitted that passengers would need to pay extra for everything from meals to baggage. He said: 'We can make money on 99 cent fares in Europe. Not every seat will be €10 of course; there will also need to be a very high number of business or premium seats.' Last year he said: 'There is 15 per cent of the public who will pay for the frills and you will be mad to switch off from that'. Mr O'Leary has previously said that 'a fleet of 30, 40, 50 aircraft and not two, four or six' would be required to get the operation up and running. Ryanair has long been accused of luring customers in with low fares while charging sky-high fees for 'extras'. Mr O'Leary has been the face of Ryanair for almost 20 years and has a reputation for being outspoken. His plans were dismissed by the chief executive of US airline JetBlue in March. Dave Barger said Mr O'Leary's claims that transatlantic tickets could be sold for €10 one-way to Boston and New York from the UK and other European locations adding: 'There's just no way.

"A budding film-maker has released a trailer for her own horror movie - after raising $31,900 (£20,000) to make it on Kickstarter. Emily DiPrimio, 14, from Philadelphia, crowdsourced the funds so she could make her own '1980s-style slasher film'. Co-written and co-directed by her father Ron, Carver is about 'a group of young teenagers who are haunted by a despicable act they committed when they were younger'. The trailer for Carver - which stars unknowns Lea Davis and Mark Ryan Anderson - has now been released . The film stars unknown actors, including Lea Davis and Mark Ryan Anderson as well as other . On the trailer's official website, it continues: 'Their actions caused the death of three innocent people. 'Now on the anniversary of those deaths, an ominous calling card, in the form of a carved pumpkin has been placed at each of their homes. 'Someone is out for revenge... the question is who?' Emily also promises that the film is a story of 'revenge and redemption' and a 'throwback to those wonderful slasher films of the Eighties'. Emily raised nearly £20,000 in donations to create Carver with the help of her father, Ron . Carver tells the story of a group of teens who are haunted by an horrible act they committed as children . And she adds: 'The kills are bloody and intense.' Emily started her Kickstarter campaign to raise cash for the movie last year. The project, which had 528 backers, reached beyond its $25,000 target by October, raising an impressive $31,900. The teenager wrote on her film's website ahead of the trailer launch: 'With the help of some wonderfully generous people we reached our Kickstarter goal. Now the movie is filmed and is in the process of being edited.' Emily said her inspiration for making her own movie came after starring in a film for her father, who wrote a short script called Wake. The film stars unknowns such as Lea Davis and Mark Ryan Anderson, pictured . She wrote on her Kickster campaign: 'I can still remember how much fun we had making the movie. 'I learned first hand that when a group of people band together towards a common goal, anything can be accomplished. 'I've been hooked ever since.' The teenager started to write her own movie script after having ankle surgery - meaning she was off her feet for 12 weeks. The first trailer for Carver is out now although no formal release date for the film has been announced . She added on Kickstarter: 'I was really down and my dad noticed and asked if I would help him write this script he had been thinking about for a while. 'Before I knew it, we were writing Carver together which made the 12 weeks fly by. 'After we finished the first draft, I remember the pride I felt at having helped write a pretty darn good screenplay. I asked my dad if we could make it and of course he said we could try, but it takes a lot of time and money to make a feature film correctly. 'That is why I am here on Kickstarter - to humbly ask you to help me make my dream of making a slasher film with my dad come true.'

Hats, today worn by the few male models on the catwalk, made their first appearance at the menswear show back in June. The collection, entitled ‘Book Covers & Bruce Chatwin’ featured original illustrations and typographic prints that took their creative lead from vintage English book covers. As always, artworks were designed and painted in-house before being printed onto cashmere, cotton and leather. Models, whose make-up had been applied by Wendy Rowe using Burberry, of course, walked to the live sounds of James Bay, and hair had been coiffed to perfection by Neil Moodie. All things bright and beautiful: Bailey, famed for his ability to reinvent the classics, reworked the iconic trench for next season in the brightest of hues with typographic prints and colourful high gloss colours . Family: Suki Waterhouse has longed worked with the British fashion house and closed the show today at Kensington Gardens .

"Kirstie Allsopp says women who want to have it all have more of a chance of getting there if they rule out motherhood as a goal. 'It’s vital women are less tough on other women. We can’t have it all,' she said. 'The women who know they don’t want children come closer to having it all than any of us do. 'As mothers, we feel guilt. Guilt is the plague of the modern woman.' Scroll down for video . Kirstie Allsopp says women can't have it all, but those who don't want children have the best chance . Kirstie, 43, who has always wanted children, says she had not one but two sperm donors lined up in case she ran out of time herself. 'It’s the first time I've ever admitted it, I had set a date at which I was going to try and have a child by myself and found two people who wanted to father my children. 'Because I have strong breast cancer gene in my family I was always very aware of importance of having children early. I made that decision, set that personal date and that had released me. 'And then I was luckily enough that I met someone and we had children.' Leyla Hussein, Kirstie Allsopp, June Sarpong and Lucy Foster, of Stylist, attend the Life Lessons talk . Her comments came as she spoke about the perils of fertility and late motherhood at a Stylist magazineLife Lessons talk in London last week. Earlier this year, the star came under attack for claiming that women should put off careers and focus on having a baby by the age of 27, because it's much harder to get pregnant later on. But the mother-of-two is undeterred and at a special talk in London she was once again warning British ladies about the perils of leaving it until your late thirties to start a family. She said: 'The facts cannot be got away from. You have a 10 per cent chance of conceiving a child over 40. I don't say this smugly - I got in just under the wire. 'I think women are being lied to. 'It gets more and more difficult to have children over the age of 35. 'Plenty of women don't want children, that's fine - but if you do, you need to know the facts.' Kirstie advised women to think seriously about delaying university until after their children are born. She said:  'I want to say to women: be honest with each other, with your partners, daughters and sons - know that you can have careers at any age, you can go to uni at any age. 'You can do a thousand brilliant things at any age. But just for now, we haven't opened the fertility window any wider. 'It is easier and simpler and less of a heartache to just have children when our bodies allow us to. 'Nature is not a feminist and that's just the truth.' IVF can put an immense pressure on a relationship, with the procedure tripling the likelihood of divorce (picture posed by models) Although Kirstie's comments on fertility were heavily criticised by certain feminist corners when she first made them this year, the star isn't alone in her opinions. Her views are backed up by the latest research figures from the University of St Andrews and Edinburgh University, which show that the average woman aged 30 only has 12 per cent of her eggs left, while a woman turning forty has only three per cent left in her reserves. On top of that, data from the European Society for Human Reproduction and Embryology shows IVF had a global failure rate of 77 per cent in 2012. Jody Day is the founder of Gateway Women, a support network for childless women in the UK who believes too many older women think IVF will come to their rescue. Jody started trying for a baby with her husband aged 29, but the marriage broke down in her late-thirties. She hoped to meet a new partner and try IVF but a suitable relationship did not materialise. At the age of 43 she found herself single again and had to begin the process of grieving and accepting her childlessness. Now she has built a community of women who share her situation. She runs workshops and retreats in London and Oxfordshire helping women who are also making the transition to a life without the family they hoped for. Jody predicts that the country is sitting on a ticking time bomb of women who are delaying pregnancy until it's too late. She said: 'Social infertility is the biggest thing for the next generation. 'In one generation, the worst social stereotype has gone from being a single mother to a woman over 40 without children. 'We see people conceiving in their forties, but they're extremely lucky, it's this mythical age. Jody Day is the founder of Gateway Women, a support network for childless women in the UK . 'In one generation we've had access to all of these things that give freedom to women; access to abortion, access to higher education, access to professions and legal access to birth control. 'But fertility is not a feminist, it is focused on us having children when we're young.' The problem doesn't just lie with delaying pregnancy though, it is also our belief that IVF is going to be the solution. Much is written about the difficulty of going through in vitro fertilization, but Jody feels there isn't enough discussed with potential patients about how low the chances of success really are. She said: 'Most of us get an education from the miracle stories - there is very little awareness that globally 77 per cent of IVF has failed. 'Most women who are struggling to conceive don't know that there is a five per cent success rate for women aged 43-44, that becomes under two per cent success for women 44 and over. Artificial insemination of a human female egg - the process has a 77 per cent global failure rate . 'If I'd have known that before I started IVF, I wouldn't have tried it.' At Jody's Gateway Women community, thousands of women come together for support. She said: 'If you're childless and a single woman, it's shameful, it's like you're not a real woman, it's like you've failed. 'Whenever I'm in the media, there's a huge response, it shows people have been reached. 'I'm doing it so there is a resource there that wasn't there when I needed it. 'I'm just one individual but I'm looking after so many women, because there is so little information out there about it - that's a taboo for you.' More and more women are now putting off having babies until their forties . But while there is little that women can do to control the amount of eggs the lose during the ageing process, fertility clinics are keen to point out that they can be very successful in offering other solutions. Freezing eggs is encouraged egg donors are also suggested as a crucial option for women who are struggling to conceive. Dr Geetha Venkat is Medical Director of the Harley Street Fertility Clinic, a practice which makes patients aware very early on in fertility treatments of all of the options available. She said: 'It is true, that a significant group of our patients are women over 40 years of age. In the last few years, we have seen the number of women in this age category coming to the clinic for fertility treatment dramatically rise. 'However, as the saying goes ‘time and tide wait for none’. 'To avoid this desperate situation, women need to be aware first and foremost and should be encouraged to freeze their eggs in their twenties and early thirties if they are going to delay childbearing. '(And) Women in their forties can improve their fertility by leading a healthy lifestyle including eating a balanced diet with high protein and high fibre, exercising regularly and avoiding smoking, drinking and using recreational drugs.' Freezing eggs and egg donors are often helpful solutions for women wanting to delay having a child (pregnant woman posed by model) A  spokesperson for the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority has also cautioned that success rate for IVF have improved dramatically in recent years. They said: 'While IVF techniques have progressed significantly in the last 20-30 years and are improving all the time, it is important to remember that IVF does not guarantee success. 'Fertility levels drop significantly when a woman passes her mid-30s, and we would always encourage women to inform themselves of the facts around fertility and IVF - as the fact is that the chance of success for a woman of 35 is around one in three. 'It is also very important that women discuss their options with clinicians, to ensure any treatment is suited to their circumstances.' However, there is no getting away from the fact that for women to be aware that they should even be freezing their eggs in the late twenties, they need to be better educated about fertility. Jody Day is now campaigning for fertility to be taught in schools alongside sex education, so that both men and women are aware of the situation when they are growing up. She said: 'Statistically, if you're talking to a group of teenagers, it is more likely that they are going to have fertility problems than that they are going to have a child before they are 18. Jody Day believes that girls and boys should be taught about fertility alongside sex education at school . 'What women have done in our generation is we have gone into a professional working world that is built around the male template of fertility, which is to work really hard in your twenties and thirties and have a family in your forties. 'We have adopted a male pattern of working and it doesn't fit female fertility. 'We need to have some very big changes in the way our society is structured if women are going to be able to have children.'

"An Italian woman claims she was arrested and thrown in a police holding cell due to a row with easyJet staff over the size of her hand luggage. The woman, identified as Luciana Bisignani, was detained by police at Geneva International Airport as she attempted to board a flight to Venice. The 48-year-old from Pederobba told Italian newspaper Il Mattino she was 'treated like a criminal, handcuffed and taken to a cell, only for not managing to put my handbag inside a suitcase.' Scroll down for video . An Italian woman claims she was detained after she got into a row with easyJet staff over her hand luggage . Luciana, who was returning home after spending the summer working at a restaurant in Chamonix, France, claimed an air steward tore her identity card and the police threw her to the ground and handcuffed her. But police and easyJet say the woman's claims that she was detained because of the size of her hand luggage and that her identity card was torn by a staff member are untrue. They say she was held because she refused to co-operate with police. Police spokesman Jean-Philippe Brandt told MailOnline Travel that the woman refused to identify herself when she attempted to check in. He said easyJet staff contacted police and when officers arrived she refused to show a passport or any other document that would identify her. She quickly flashed her passport but put it back in her bag, he added. easyJet says the woman was escorted away because she behaved in a 'disruptive' way toward police officers . Mr Brandt said she refused to accompany the officers to the airport's police station and they had no choice but to 'force her' to go with them. He said the police officers' handling of the situation is in line with today's state of security at airports. 'We have very strict procedures with people who make trouble just before the plane makes take-off. We have to be very strict concerning all of the problems concerning flights and airplanes.' Luton-based easyJet confirmed the woman was escorted away because she behaved in a 'disruptive' manner while she was dealing with police. The airline told MailOnline Travel: 'easyJet's cabin crew and ground staff are trained to assess and evaluate all incidents and act quickly and appropriately. 'We take all incidents of disruptive behaviour very seriously. The safety and welfare of our passengers and crew is easyJet's highest priority.' The woman told Il Mattino she spent almost two hours in a cell and feels she should have received an apology when she was released. She alleges she spent the night in the airport and bought a new ticket for her journey home to Italy.","Luciana Bisignani, 48, was arrested at Geneva International Airport .

"It's Tebow Time on Good Morning America. The one-time NFL quarterback made his debut on ABC today with an inspiring story of a little boy who overcame the loss of both his legs and returned to the football field. The network has hired Tim Tebow to anchor a new segment called 'Motivate Me Mondays.' It's the latest step into the broadcast world for the former college star, whose NFL career peaked and then dried up under the national spotlight. Scroll down for video . Come on out! Tim Tebow made a grand entrance on Good Morning America Today, stepping through a specially made 'Motivate Me Monday' door . Tebow Time: Tebow's winning smile was on full display as he talked passionately about his new gig - which has him roving the country searching for inspiring stories of courageous kids . Tebow, a Heisman Trophy winner for the Florida Gators, works as a college football analyst for ESPN and the new SEC Network. He will travel across the U.S. for Good Morning America to tell feel-good stories for the morning show. Tebow's first segment was about 10-year-old Deven Jackson, a Pennsylvania boy who lost both his his legs six inches below the knee after contracting meningitis. The horrified disease nearly killed him, but he fought back - and returned to playing football thanks to a pair of donated running blades. 'To be able to share these amazing stories about kids who have so much courage and have overcome so many obstacles and that's what really inspiring. It's awesome for me to be able to share these stories,' he told GMA. Tebow's first segment focused on 10-year-old Deven Jackson, who lost both legs after a horrific bout of meningitis. He learned to walk again and eventually returned to football - the game he loves . Tebow, outspoken about his Christian faith both on and off the field, developed a national following before he ever entered the NFL. After spending a season and a half riding the bench for the Denver Brocos, he shocked the nation by leading them to two unlikely victories - including one in the playoffs - in 2011. His practice of 'Tebowing' - bowing his head in prayer after making touchdown passes - divided the nation. Millions of devoted fans praised him for not hiding his faith. However, Tebow's NFL prospects dimmed the next year when he saw little playing time for the New York Jets. In 2013, the New England Patriots invited him to training camp, but cut him before the season. Tebow has since recast himself as a broadcast personality - relying on his good looks, easy smile and down-home charm.","Tim Tebow is already a college football analyst for ESPN and SEC Network .

"I've not played a game of cricket since I left school and so was a bit concerned when I was invited to play at the Bodo Schloss vs Raffles end of summer cricket match. For those of you who don't live in Kensington & Chelsea these are two of the biggest nightclubs in the Royal Borough, and there's a fierce rivalry between the two, so this looked like becoming a bit of grudge match. So much so that my team Bodo Schloss employed the services of Surrey & England cricketer Jade Dernbach. This and the fact that I hadn't bowled a ball for at least eight years made me worry that I might end up letting the side down a bit. Scroll down for video . Spencer (second left on rope) took part in a game of tug of war after a cricket match between Chelsea night clubs Bodo Schloss and Raffles . These concerns left me when I got a wicket on my first ball - I got a nice bit of movement by the off stump, the batsman caught an edge and was picked up in the slips. Our innings was looking pretty good when Hugo Taylor fell to Dernbach – at least he could say he was bowled by an England cricketer. Spencer (in bobble hat) was on the Bodo Schloss team for tug of war . The Bodo Schloss team lost to Raffles and Spencer says this is because they had more weight their end . I've got to say Hugo did look impressive in whites – like a young Jeremy Irons in Brideshead Revisited, only with a deep St Tropez tan. Jamie however let the Bodo side down, sartorially at least, by wearing his baseball cap back to front when he was keeping wicket, and his pre-match warm-up involved a cold bottle of beer. Bizarrely Jamie bumped into Gordon Ramsay who just happened to be walking past the ground, just behind Sloane Square. It has been noted several times before that the pair bear a slight resemblance, but the Twitter rumours are not true – Gordon is not Jamie's father. Jamie Laing also joined Spencer at the match and bumped into his celebrity look-a-like Gordon Ramsey . It was all down-hill after lunch – there was a humiliating defeat in the lunchtime tug of war. If anything my Forza fitness and weight-loss regime hasn't helped me here. You need a bit of heft behind you for this 'sport' and I've lost nearly a stone with the Forza T5 Super Strength and even though I'm much more toned, it's sheer bulk that you need to win this game. I was second in the row and kept my position but the guys behind lost their balance and the whole line collapsed and got dragged rather unceremoniously across the out-field. Spencer says that Jamie was showing him up by wearing a backwards baseball cap . This drubbing in the tug of war must have hit us hard psychologically. Our batting order collapsed in the same that we did with a rope in our hands. I only managed to score three runs and we lost by 165 to 85. We drowned our sorrows with some champagne ice lollies afterwards. Lots of love, Spencer.

"A five-month-old baby who had been on life support since last Monday after being brutally beaten by his mother's boyfriend has died. Andres Bravo, who was admitted to Miami Children's Hospital with brain injuries, a lung contusion, retinal hemorrhaging to both eyes and bruising to his buttocks, was taken off life support on Saturday, after doctors determined his injuries were too severe. These injuries all occurred while the infant was alone with his mother's boyfriend, 27-year-old Antwan Sawyer, who claims they were sustained when the child fell off a bed. Scroll down for video . Tragic end: Five-month-old Andres Bravo was taken off life support on Saturday after doctors determined the injuries he suffered from a beating on Monday were too severe . Call for justice: Andres' father, Adolfo Bravo (seen above with his son), is calling on law enforcement to arrest his son's mother for allowing this abuse to happen . Investigators and medical examiners immediately realized the infant's injuries were non-accidental, and arrested Sawyer on Tuesday. This is Sawyer's tenth arrest since 2005 according to police. Now, as Sawyer's charges are raised from aggravated child abuse to attempted felony murder, Andres' father, Adolfo Bravo, is calling on authorities to arrest his son's mother, Sascha Marie Garcia, for allowing this tragedy to happen. Laying low: Andres' mother, Sascha Marie Garcia, was at work when the incident occurred, and has been avoiding the press since her son was first admitted to the hospital last week . Charged: Antwan Sawyer is being charged with attempted felony murder in the death of five-month-old Andres . An emotional Bravo told WPLG, 'I feel like she's very responsible for the whole incident.' He then pointed out there were several examples of cases in Florida where even though the mother was not at the scene of the actual crime, she was still charged with neglect. He added that after speaking with homicide detectives he is certain Garcia will be picked up, and a petition has been started to see that she is charged on the Justice for Baby Andres Facebook page. A neighbor who lives directly below Garcia and Sawyer in their south Miami apartment told the Miami Herald she often heard the mother yelling and cursing at Andres and another toddler. Police claim Garcia works as an exotic dancer at a local strip club, The Office. She is believed to have been at work when the beating occurred. And it was the mother who called Bravo to alert him of his son's injuries last week, though she failed to express to her ex just how severe they were at the time. 'I was going to stop by and visit him,' said the heartbroken father. 'But I ended up never leaving.'

Her win came despite an embarrassing spelling mistake that appeared on screen during her talent performance. As Kazantsev sang her heart out, information about her interests popped up on screen - including that she loves anything Jane Austin (sic). Twitter was soon awash with people pointing out the misspelling of Pride and Prejudice author Austen. Many on social media were critical of Kazantsev's performance, but she said she was inspired by the 2012 movie Pitch Perfect in which Anna Kendrick's character auditions for an a capella group by performing rhythmically with a cup. Kazantsev also said she did it to show future contestants they can win the Miss America pageant by performing whatever talent routine they like, regardless of what others think of it.

'The reason why I chose to do that talent is I wanted every single little girl in America to be able to see that you can do that talent - you can do whatever talent you want on national television - even with a red cup - and still be Miss America and have the time of your life,' Kazantsev said. 'I literally in that minute and 30 seconds had the most fun I've ever had, and that's because I stayed true to myself and I did what I wanted to do for my talent, no matter what everybody else told me, and it paid off. I'm very happy about it.' Kazantsev, who named combating sexual assault in the military as the issue about which she would want female U.S. Senators to press their male counterparts, won a $50,000 scholarship with which she plans to attend law school. She also plans to speak out against domestic violence during her yearlong resign as Miss America. Her victory marked the third year in a row that a contestant from her state has walked away with the crown in the nationally televised pageant. Kazantsev received the crown at Atlantic City's Boardwalk Hall from outgoing Miss America — and Miss New York — Nina Davuluri .

The pageant shone a positive light on the struggling seaside gambling resort, which has been in the national news for all the wrong reasons lately: a rash of casino closings, thousands of unemployed workers, and a domestic violence case involving a former NFL star. For three hours Sunday night, America got a different look at Atlantic City. The Miss America pageant presented an upbeat view of the city where it began in 1921. It featured iconic Atlantic City visuals including its beach, Boardwalk, the Steel Pier, Black Fish Pier near Brigantine, and the Atlantic City Beach Patrol station. 'Atlantic City is facing a challenging economic climate and our hearts go out to all of those who have lost their jobs,' said Sam Haskell III, CEO of the Miss America organization.

'We hope that our Miss America telecast... will generate great interest for Atlantic City on a national scale as we showcase their beautiful beaches and Boardwalk.' There has been no shortage of compelling story lines leading up to the selection of the next Miss America, including the way personal tragedy has shaped the public service platforms of several contestants. The brother of Miss Wisconsin Raeanna Johnson killed himself after a secret addiction to methamphetamine. Her platform was the impact of substance abuse on the family. The father of Miss Kansas Amanda Sasek killed himself when she was 17. Her platform was helping people find their strengths. Miss Delaware Brittany Lewis is still waiting for an arrest to be made in the 2010 slaying of her sister. Her platform is combating domestic violence.

'I did my best. I got to show my pump on the Miss America stage.' There was drama and even some low-brow comedy leading up to the finale. Miss Rhode Island, Ivy DePew, collapsed onstage during the first night of preliminary competition, but made it back the next night after two trips to the hospital for dehydration. An incident that generated much amusement among viewers was when cameras caught Miss Nebraska Megan Swanson opening her legs a bit too widely and accidentally showing the world way too much of herself. The embarrassing incident happened as host Chris Harrison was previewed the evening wear phase of the competition and the hashtag #MissNebraska immediately started trending. And supermodel and business mogul Kathy Ireland took the stage to burp on command on a dare from pageant host Dena Blizzard on the second night.

"NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell failed to attend the 49ers season opener on Sunday, as pressure mounted for him to resign following the Ray Rice domestic violence scandal . NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell dodged an appearance at a 49ers game on Sunday as pressure mounted on him to resign in the wake of the Ray Rice domestic violence scandal. Goodell, who has been under intense pressure since a video appeared showing Rice punching his then-fiancee unconscious, had agreed to watch the San Francisco team's season opener at the newly constructed Levi's Stadium. He had indicated he would attend as early as April 2012, when construction of the stadium first began. The president of the 49ers, Paraag Marathe, had earlier said he had expected Goodell at the game, according to the Huffington Post. The no-show capped off a week which American media dubbed the 'worst week in the history of the NFL'. It follows a video released by TMZ on September 8 showing Rice punching Janay Palmer in an elevator in Atlantic City. The Baltimore Ravens player was later released by his team and indefinitely suspended by the NFL - a punishment that was criticised for being too lenient and too late. Goodell claimed he hadn't seen the most graphic portion of the video. An earlier version of the footage had been given to NFL bosses months before. After an initial version of the video was released in February, Rice was given a two-game suspension, which led to calls for Goodell to resign. The NFL has a history of imposing only minor punishments on players accused of domestic violence. Terry O'Neill, president of the National Organization for Women, this week said the only 'workable solution' was for Goodell to resign. Scroll down for video .

He told the Boston Globe that the league needed new leadership to change the 'culture of violence against women that pervades the NFL'. In another incident over the weekend, Minnesota Vikings player, Adrian Peterson, appeared in court accused of striking his four-year-old son 10-15 times with a tree branch. The 29-year-old was freed on bail, on a charge of causing injury to a child, after turning himself in to Texas police after a warrant was issued for his arrest.

And in a third incident, Carolina Panthers' player Greg Hardy, is awaiting trial on charges of assault on a female and communicating threats. Authorities said he had chocked his then-girlfriend, threw her around, dragged her by her hair and had threatened to kill her. Hardy was found guilty by a judge in July and was sentenced to 18 months of probation and was given a 60-day suspended sentence. He then appealed the verdict and is now set to appear before a jury in November.","Goodell said as early as April 2012 that he would attend season opener .

"It’s fair to say that The Lord of the Rings author J.R.R.Tolkien wasn’t thinking of holiday destinations when he dreamt up Middle-Earth as the setting for his literary masterpiece. Nor indeed would JK Rowling ever have imagined that the fictional Diagon Alley in her Harry Potter novels might one day be considered a tourist hotspot. But that is exactly how one artist has depicted the famous fantasy worlds. Diagon Alley is a fictional street from Harry Potter located in London behind a pub called the Leaky Cauldron . Going under the name The Green Dragon Inn, they have turned well-known locations from series including Game of Thrones into posters based on vintage 1920s-style travel adverts. Rohan, a fictional realm of Middle-Earth in Lord of the Rings where farmers and cavalrymen live, has been transformed into a weekend destination for horse riding, while Gondor, another fantasy Kingdom from the 1950s novels, appears as a sunny coastal destination where visitors can ‘live like a king’. Meanwhile, The Shire - the rolling land where the Hobbits live in Lord of the Rings - is shown as the ideal spot for a game of miniature golf. The Hogwarts Express is the name of the train that makes a run between  King's Cross Station  and Hogsmeade Station in the Harry Potter novels . Winterfell, the 8,000-year-old kingdom built by giants in George R.R. Martin’s Game of Thrones series, is shown as a site of ancient history, while another poster encourages more adventurous tourists to ‘venture beyond The Wall’, a reference to the ancient barrier of stone, ice and magic, hundreds of feet high and hundreds of miles long. In the novels, The Wall shields the Seven Kingdoms from the Northern wilderness and is manned by the Night's Watch, an order of warriors sworn to serve there for life, forgoing marriage, titles, property and children. Hogwarts, the legendary school of wizards attended by Harry Potter, is another fictional world that has been given the artist’s treatment along with the Hogwarts Express, which is depicted as the perfect way to enjoy a view of the countryside while travelling. Rohan, a fictional realm of Middle-Earth in The Lord of the Rings where farmers and cavalrymen live, is advertised as a weekend destination for horse riding . Other fictional kingdoms that receive the artist’s creative interpretation are Lake Town and Rivendell, both from Lord of the Rings, and King’s Landing, the capital of the Seven Kingdoms in Game of Thrones. The posters are being sold on Green Dragon Inn's Etsy.com page, with fantasy fans able to buy the prints for £10.

"The pilot of the missing MH370 . flight killed himself and his passengers by switching off the oxygen . supply in what is the sixth example of such a suicide, according to an . aviation expert. Ewan . Wilson, head of Kiwi Airlines, believes Zaharie Ahmad Shah planned mass . murder - locking his co-pilot out of the cockpit, depressurising the . cabin and shutting down all communication links before turning the plane around. Having . examined all other possibilities, Mr Wilson insists that Shah, 53, is . responsible for the deaths of the 227 passengers and 12 crew members on . board the doomed Malaysian Airlines flight, which disappeared on March . 8. Scroll down for video . Theory: Geoff Taylor (left) and Ewan Wilson who have written a book which claims the pilot of MH370 cut off the oxygen supply to the passengers before deliberately crashing into the Indian Ocean . And shockingly, Mr . Wilson will tell British aviation experts today that there have been . five other suicide flights in recent times, as he travels from New . Zealand to Birmingham for a meeting, the Birmingham Mail reports. He said: 'There is a fundamental desire to ignore the mental health issue in the aviation industry. 'Our . research indicates there have been five previous incidents of . murder/suicide in commercial flights over the last three decades or so, . accounting for 422 lives. 'The sad addition of MH370 would bring that number to 661.' 'Mentally ill': The book claims the most likely scenario is that pilot Zaharie Ahmad Shah (above) deliberately depressurised the cabin then flew for another three hours before ditching into the sea . Although . oxygen masks would have dropped down automatically from above the . seats, the passengers' supply was limited to just 20 minutes. People unable to grab a mask, such as those sleeping, would have passed out within the space of a few minutes. The . entire 'ghost plane' - including her cabin crew whose air supply is . only marginally longer, would have slipped into a coma and died shortly . after from oxygen starvation. Ahmad . Shah, who locked his co-pilot out of the cockpit, survived long enough - . either by repressurising the aircraft or from breathing his own, more . extensive air supply - to evade radar and 'execute his master plan', Mr . Wilson has concluded. The . Kiwi Airlines chief says he then made eight different course changes . before allowing the jet to fly on auto-pilot for its final few hours. He . then performed a controlled ditching in the sea, which would explain . why no debris has been found because the plane landed and sank in one . piece. The theory is the result of . the first independent study into March's disaster by the New . Zealand-based air accident investigator, Ewan Wilson. Mr Wilson, the founder of Kiwi Airlines . and a commercial pilot himself, arrived at the shocking conclusion after . considering 'every conceivable alternative scenario'. However, he has not been able to provide any conclusive evidence to support his theory. An earlier report from the Australian Transport Safety Bureau (ATSB) also concluded that passengers may have died from hypoxia. And Malaysian authorities previously named Ahmad Shah as their prime suspect. The . remarkable claims are made in the book 'Goodnight Malaysian 370', the . culmination of a four-month study into the incident, which Wilson . co-wrote with the New Zealand broadsheet journalist, Geoff Taylor. Wilson, . a qualified transport safety investigator, said: 'One of our objectives . in writing this book was, in some small way, to convey the human . stories of the tragedy. 'Our . other, more important task was to pursue the truth about what really . happened; that is one small contribution we felt we could make to this . whole, terrible affair. 'We could never have foreseen the information we uncovered, or their implications. 'Neither could we have imagined the horrific scenario that our research suggests took place on board that fateful plane.' Wilson and Taylor's entire scenario makes for difficult reading. Search . continues: Officials claim they are 'making progress' as they continue . to scour 60,000 sq km of sea for the plane. The orange line indicates . 'high priority' search areas; the yellow has been searched already . They . believe that Ahmad Shah, who they have concluded was suffering from . mental illness, tricked his co-pilot, father-of-three, Fariq Hamid, into taking a break . about 40 minutes after take-off. After . locking Hamid out of the cockpit, Ahmad Shah made his last broadcast to . air traffic control - 'Goodnight, Malaysian 370' - before switching off . the aircraft's air-to-ground communication links. Alone . at the controls, he took MH370 up to 39,000 feet and de-pressurised the . aircraft, giving passengers and crew less than 60 seconds of Time of . Useful Consciousness (TUC). Ahmad . Shah could not have prevented the plane's oxygen masks from . automatically dropping down or an automated emergency announcement in . English. But Flight 370 was a . night flight and, with the cabin lights off, the majority of passengers . would have been asleep, or close to it. And for 227 of the 239 passengers, English was not their first language. Cabin crew would have tried to help those on board, but would have had to have donned their own facemasks first. International . effort: Australia's deputy prime minister Warren Truss unveiled the . latest search plan at a press conference in Canberra earlier this month. The . government has contracted a new firm to take up the search . 'It would have been a frightening and confusing time throughout the cabin,' Taylor said. 'By . the time some of the passengers had woken up groggy, heard the . commotion and looked around in confusion, it would have been too late . for them. 'Those passengers . who did not react within 60 seconds or less would have lapsed into . unconsciousness and death would have followed within four to six . minutes.' Those who had found a mask would have had between 12 and 22 minutes of breathing time before blacking out. The cabin crew's oxygen supply would have lasted for about 70 minutes, depending upon the height of the aircraft. By the time MH370 returned to cruising altitude, everyone on board would have perished. Ahmad . Shah would have had three hours' worth of oxygen - plenty enough, the . authors believe, to carry out the 'final act of his performance'. They . conclude that he set a course for the southern Indian Ocean and, after . the fuel ran dry, glided the aircraft for a further 100 nautical miles . before performing a controlled ditching on the surface of the water. Wilson, . a trained commercial pilot, said: 'Ahmad Shah was a man known for his . methodical, thorough nature, for his love of the technical, and probably . for his ego, too. 'This would have been his final sad act to his family and to the world: ""find this one"".'","Ewan Wilson claims Zaharie Ahmad Shah deliberately depressurised cabin .

"About one in four National Football League players are likely to end up suffering dementia, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease or other cognitive impairments during their lifetime, according to a report filed in court by the league's lawyers. The NFL submitted the summary of the findings of an actuarial study it had commissioned in the U.S. District Court for Eastern Pennsylvania on Friday as part of the ongoing litigation between former players and the league. The study by the Segal Group, based in New York City, used a database of the medical history of retired players as part of its method. Lifetime of head injuries: Ray Easterling was drafted by the Atlanta Falcons in 1972. He committed suicide in 2012, shooting himself after suffering clinical depression resulting from dementia caused by head injuries sustained in his football career . Raising awareness: Former NFL running back Kevin Turner, who was diagnosed with Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), also known as Lou Gehrig's disease . The report appears to be the most definitive statement the NFL has yet made on the dangers of the sometimes violent sport, where players can develop concussions as they butt helmeted heads with those of other players. The report said 28 per cent of the 'overall player population' and a third of the 5,000 plaintiffs who sued the league, will be diagnosed with cognitive impairment during their lifetime, according to the court filings. Judge Anita Brody granted preliminary approval to a landmark deal that would compensate thousands of former players for concussion-related claims in July . The chances of players developing these problems 'are materially higher than those expected in the general population,' the lawyers' summary of the report said. Players will develop these diagnoses 'at notably younger ages than the general population,' the summary said. In 2013, the NFL agreed to pay more than $760 million to settle a lawsuit brought by more than 4,500 former players who had sued the league, accusing it of hiding the dangers of brain injury while profiting from the sport's violence. In June, the league agreed to remove a $675 million ceiling it had placed on payments to former players. The NFL commissioned the Segal Group to complete the study to see if the money set aside for the settlement would cover all the claims. Brad Karp, one of NFL's lawyers in the lawsuit, said in a statement that the Segal models 'do not reflect a prediction of the number of players who will suffer injuries.' 'They are intended to show the court that even if unexpectedly high numbers of players were injured,' his statement said, 'there still would be sufficient money to pay the claims.' In the court filing, the authors of the Segal report say the assumptions on which their projections are based were 'reasonable and conservative.'","A quarter of all NFL players are likely to suffer brain disorders during their lifetime .

"The crumbling St Ita's hospital in Portrane, Co Dublin was the most expensive building ever sanctioned by the British Government in Ireland when commissioned in 1895. With a capacity of 1,200 beds, the facility, known then as the Portrane Lunatic Asylum, was seen as being at the frontier of mental health care. Over the past decade Irish health authorities have been gradually closing the final Victorian era facilities. The last 27 patients housed on two wings were moved to accommodation late last year as the neo-Gothic style hospital was closed. Now, the building in Portrane is silent. However an urban explorer called Obscuraprints accessed the site and took this series of eerie images, offering a fascinating insight into Victorian mental health care. Scroll down for video . When it was commissioned in 1895, the Portrane Lunatic Asylum was the most expensive ever building paid for by the British in Ireland at a planned cost of £200,000 . The asylum was designed by architect George Coppinger Ashlin in a neo-gothical style and as a result the costs spiraled to £300,000 - £32 million in today's money . St Ita's at its height housed 1,200 patients but there were just 27 remaining by mid 2013 as health authorities prepared the decaying unit for its eventual closure . The hospital was divided between men and women, and then it was further divided into four further sections depending on a the severity of the mental illness involved . When the final patients were removed from the Victorian facility, not all of their personal effects were collected and left strewn across the floor . Despite the decay, St Ita's was considered state of the art, with each of the wings having a view of the sea just 500 metres away to aid in the patients' recovery . The building was designed to be functional as well, with the clock tower doubling as a water tower which could be used in the event of a fire at the facility . The project was supervised by Alfred Ignatius McGloughlin who was forced to flee to the US during construction after he had an 'illicit liaison' with one of his maids . According to the Irish Department of Arts, Heritage and Gaeltacht: 'Ireland had a leading place in the establishment of lunatic asylums in the nineteenth century'","In 1895 Portrane Lunatic Asylum was the most expensive building in Ireland paid for by the British Government .

"Biased media coverage helped Turkey's prime minister romp home in the country's first direct presidential election, international observers have warned. Unofficial results show Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who has dominated Turkish politics for more than a decade, won the presidency outright yesterday with nearly 52 per cent of the vote. But monitors from the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe said today Erdogan's 'use of his official position, along with biased media coverage, gave him a distinct advantage over the other candidates.'

Erdogan supporters cheer and wave flags in Istanbul after hearing news of the election win . Two Turkish women pose with a cardboard cut out of Erdogan outside the AKP Party HQ in Istabul . Erdogan's campaign dominated the media coverage, according to the Associated Press. Unofficial vote tallies by the Turkish media showed Erdogan won about 51.9 percent in Sunday's election, with his main challenger Ekmeleddin Ihsanoglu following with 38.3 percent. Selahattin Demirtas, a young Kurdish politician running on a left-wing platform, was in third place with 9.7 percent. The election commission was expected to issue official vote figures later today. A three-term prime minister who has dominated Turkish politics for more than a decade, Erdogan has been a divisive figure. Revered by many as a champion of the people who has steered Turkey to years of economic prosperity, he has been criticised by others for an allegedly autocratic style of governance that critics say has tried to impose his religious and conservative mores on a nation built on secularism. Moreover, Erdogan has now vowed to transform the presidency from a largely ceremonial post into a powerful position. He has said he will activate the post's rarely used dormant powers - a legacy of a 1980 coup - including the ability to call parliament and summon Cabinet meetings. 'Erdogan got what he wanted,' Murat Yetkin, Editor-in-Chief of the Hurriyet Daily News, wrote in an editorial Monday. 'He wanted to consolidate all the executive power in his hands and now he has the chance and capacity for that.'

A man reads a newspaper in central Istanbul: The front page is reporting Erdogan's election victory . In his victory speech Sunday night, Erdogan struck a conciliatory tone toward critics who fear he is bent on a power grab as he embarks on another five years at the country's helm. 'Today is a milestone for Turkey. Today is the day Turkey is born from its ashes and a new Turkey is built,' he told thousands of cheering, flag-waving supporters from the balcony of his party headquarters in the capital, Ankara. 'I will not be the president of only those who voted for me. I will be the president of 77 million,' he vowed. Not everyone was convinced. 'For me, he is not my president. I'm the people but he is not my president. First of all, the elections period wasn't fair,' said Sener Gunduz, a surveyor in Istanbul. International election monitors who visited a limited number of polling stations said Sunday's vote was 'generally organised in a professional and efficient manner.' But they said unbalanced media coverage prior to the vote strongly favored Erdogan. Erdogan's dominance in media coverage ahead of the election 'almost certainly was to his benefit when voters entered polling booths,' said Vilija Aleknaite Abramkiene, coordinator for the monitors from the OSCE. But she added that the vote showed 'there is a vibrant political life in Turkey' and the results showed 'the potential for a healthy balance in political forces.'","Unofficial count shows Recep Tayyip Erdogan won with 52 per cent of votes .

"A British Playboy model  who was diagnosed with brain cancer last year says she has now become a shy introvert after surgery to remove the tumour. Kerri Parker, 30, used to spend her time partying at Hugh Hefner's Playboy mansion in LA, drinking with A-list stars including Leonardo Di Caprio, and was once a body-double for Megan Fox. But now she says she would rather spend time on her sofa with a cup of tea after surgery to remove a cancerous tumour left her with a 'personality transplant'. Scroll down for video . Kerri Parker, 30, was a lab technician but in 2003 became a model after winning a competition. However following surgery to remove a brain tumour, she says she has now become a 'wallflower' In an interview with the Sunday People, she said: 'At first it was small things but soon I noticed bigger changes. I thought it would be a good idea for me to get back into modelling but when I tried I just felt above it all. 'It's bizarre. I used to be the heart and soul of the party and now I'm a wallflower. I've swapped my skimpy dresses for comfy trackies.' Miss Parker grew up in Norwich where she was a straight-A student, and studied at the University of East London before becoming a lab technician at Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital. However, all that changed in 2003 after she entered herself into a modelling competition in FHM magazine and made it to the finals. She left her job to compete in national beauty pageants, and was picked up by the likes of lads magazine Max Power and U.S. swimwear brand Starwear. She also appeared in American FHM, Maxim and American Playboy, starred in films such as Lesbian Vampire Killers, The Bourne Ultimatum, Batman: The Dark Knight and was a body-double for Megan Fox on the set of How to Lose Friends and Alienate People. In 2012 she became an official Playmate and moved to the Playboy mansion in LA, spending time between there and the UK where she owns one of the UK's largest modelling agencies. However, last November she was diagnosed with a brain tumour aged 29 following a holiday to Egypt. At the time she told the Eastern Daily Press: 'I had been feeling unwell for about a year and have been getting worse and worse. 'When I got back from Egypt this week I had a really bad headache and was feeling sick. I couldn’t look at bright lights and I ended up being rushed into A&E.' In February she had surgery on her frontal lobe, the part of the brain that controls memory and personality, including spontaneity,  impulse control, and social and sexual behavior. While the surgery was a complete success with no physical side-effects, Miss Parker says she now struggles to come to terms with her new personality. She told the People that  she has lost friends because of the extreme change, which even affects what types of food she finds appealing. She added that she is trying to remain positive and is taking steps to try and reverse the personality change, but does not know how long it will take.

"As Cara Delevingne, Jourdan Dunn and Hailey Baldwin hit the Topshop Unique runway today, it wasn't just their fierce attitude and covetable clothes that caught our eye. With their flawless skin, bold red lips and tonal eyes, Sir Philip Green's girls looked picture perfect as they strutted their stuff on the catwalk - but it takes a lot of work and a team of experts who work like a well-oiled machine to look this good. FEMAIL went backstage ahead of the show and watched Cara and co be beautified by Topshop Beauty's mastermind make-up artist, Hannah Murray. Scroll down for video . Access all areas: FEMAIL went backstage at Topshop Unique where Cara Delevingne and her model pals were being beautified by Hannah Murray, Topshop Beauty's head make-up artist . 'This look is inspired by the beachy glamour of the British seaside to complement the clothes,' she told us while expertly applying make-up to Cara's face. 'The look is fresh faced, youthful and natural looking. There's no base, just primer on the T-zone, concealer where it's needed and Vaseline and a hint of cheek gel on the apple of the cheeks.' Up close and personal: The look was inspired by the beachy glamour of the British seaside to complement the clothes. Jourdan Dunn can be seen getting beautified . Ready for her close up: Cara is worked on by Hannah's team who created a fresh faced, youthful and natural look for Sir Philip Green's show . Touch up: While the skin was kept minimal, it was the lip that took centre stage and cheeks complemented the bold lip thanks to a pop of blush . While the skin was kept minimal, it was the lip that took centre stage. ‘Lips are effortless, with a pop of colour and a just kissed glow. The whole look is designed to look like the girls have done it themselves on the bus, they don't care if their lipstick is smudged,' said Hannah. It's easy - and purse-friendly - to do yourself at home. Use your finger to help create two textures, firstly pat on Lip Ombre in Baffle, before applying Lipstick in Temptation in the same fashion creating a deep burgundy colour on the lips. With a clean finger, smudge around the lips to achieve an intense finish with a soft diffused edge and voila, lips a la Cara. The master at work: Hannah Murray completes Jourdan's beauty look using two textures. Firstly she patted on Lip Ombre in Baffle, before applying Lipstick in Temptation in the same fashion . Bold: Lips were designed to look effortless, with a pop of colour and a just kissed glow. The whole look is designed to look like the girls have done it themselves on the bus, said Hannah . Eyes adhered to the theme we've been seeing at a lot of shows - vivid, tonal and understated. ‘I used a cream nude eye shadow on the eyelids, blending out to create a soft wash of colour before smudging kohl pencil into the lashes and only applying mascara to the top lashes,' added Hannah. And it wasn't just the model's faces that Hannah's team paid attention to: nails were beautified too (they are yet another accessory after all). Taking inspiration from a red, rusty coloured leather jacket, the girls' nails were painted bold red to perfectly complement the vibrancy of the popping lip. 'This girl has attitude but it’s a subtle confidence, on this occasion it steers away from grungy or harsh lines. With diffused edges and smudges she’s effortlessly cool, allowing her skin to speak for itself,' added Hannah.

"When it comes to high street shops, Topshop undoubtedly holds the title as the coolest kid on the block so the Unique SS15 show today was the weekend's most anticipated - and Sir Philip Green sure knows how to blow every other show out of the water. The Arcadia boss called on his A-list pals, including Poppy Delevingne, Ellie Goulding, Laura Carmichael and Alexa Chung, to occupy the front row. His model roll call was equally as starry. The pack was lead by none other than Cara Delevingne (she is the face of Topshop after all), followed by her best friend Jourdan Dunn, Lily Donaldson and Malaika Firth. Still with us? Good, because Brit favourites Matilda Lowther, Sam Rollinson and Charlotte Wiggins walked too and Kendall Jenner's sidekick Hailey Baldwin even flew in from LA to complete the formidable crew of Topshop clothes horses.

'At its core is a switched-on, youthful spirit - a dance-all-night, sea-sprayed celebration of British youth culture that lives for the weekend.' Undeniably athletic in style, bold cycling jerseys in white, midnight blue and pillarbox red, were teamed with derrière-baring frilly knickers, which were as fun as they were flirty. Party girls: For SS15, the inspiration is faded glamour of the British seaside and the girl is a switched-on, youthful spirit - a dance-all-night, sea-sprayed celebration of British youth culture that lives for the weekend, said designer Emma .

"A super-slimming bride has  lost over seven stone in time for her wedding day. The hairdresser finally decided to lose weight when she was ordered off a ride at Walt Disney World in Florida for being too fat. Becky Hames, 25, from Cannock in Staffordshire piled on the pounds after gorging on an unhealthy diet of McDonald's, crisps and chocolate bars since childhood. Super slimmer: Pictured Becky Hames, 25, from Cannock in Staffordshire lost over seven stone in time to tie the knot . At her heaviest, Becky tipped the scales at 17st 4Ibs and ballooned to a hefty size 24. Her bulging waistline of 39in meant she was unable to bring herself to try on wedding dresses after her fiancé Stephen, 27, proposed to her in 2011. But the final straw came the following summer when her family took a trip to Walt Disney World in Orlando, Florida. Stuck in a rut: Becky Hames pictured with Minnie Mouse at Disney World Florida in September 2012, where she was told she was too fat to go on a ride . While queuing for a ride at the Aquatica water park, Becky was horrified when lifeguards told her she could not go down the slide in case she got stuck. She was then left in tears as she was forced to embarrassingly walk back down the steps in front of dozens of other people. Yet the incident inspired her to take drastic action and lose weight in time for her wedding day, so after returning from holiday, she joined her local Slimming World in Cannock . Blushing bride: Becky Hames (right) with sister Amy Less (left) on her wedding day in August 2014 showing off her incredible weight loss . Becky says: 'I didn't want to be a fat bride but the incident at Disney World just tipped me over the edge. That is when I felt the most down. 'They stopped me from going on a water slide because they said I was too big. It was horrible and so embarrassing having to walk back down in front of all those people. 'In the end none of my family went on it because they didn't want to leave me behind. What a difference: Becky Hames pictured left weighing 17st 4Ibs and pictured right after losing over seven stone . 'It's one of the worst things to ever happen to me and just left me feeling rubbish. It was then I knew I had to do something about my weight in time for my wedding.' Incredibly within 18 months she had lost more than seven stone and weighed a trim 10st 2Ibs. Becky managed to slim down for her big day by transforming her diet and now eats at least 10 fruit and veg portions a day. The past: Becky Hames piled on the pounds after gorging on an unhealthy diet of McDonald's, crisps and chocolate bars since childhood . New beginning: Becky Hames didn't want to be a fat bride but the incident at Disney World tipped her over the edge . She explains: 'We had been engaged a year and had set a date but I couldn't bring myself to try on any dresses because I just felt so awful about my weight. 'Stephen always said he loved me whatever size but I had to do this for me. 'Now I am just two pounds off my personal ideal weight and have gone from a size 24 to a size 12. Happy ending: Becky Hames with husband Stephen cutting the cake on their wedding day, managed to slim down for her big day by transforming her diet and now eats at least 10 fruit and veg portions a day . 'My wedding dress even had to be taken in, I was beyond chuffed. 'I felt amazing, I had never experienced feeling good in clothes and the first time I ever wore a dress was for my hen party. 'When I saw the wedding picture I knew all the hard work was worth it. I still can't believe it is me.' Family time: Becky Hames (left to right) with Vicky Hames, husband Stephen Hames, Debbie Hames and Grant Hames on her wedding day in August 2014 . Last month, the blushing bride tied the knot with Stephen, an IT worker, in a lavish ceremony at Moor Hall Hotel in Sutton Coldfield. Now the couple are planning to head back to Orlando for a two week honeymoon, so Becky can finally experience the slide she was banned from. She added: 'I am really looking forward to going to water parks and wearing a swimming costume without having to wear extra clothes to try to cover myself up. 'I feel as confident as ever and I'm going back there so I can finally ride this slide - it better be a good one.'","Becky Hames, 25, from Cannock in Staffordshire ballooned to a size 24 .

"Kings Park is a small suburban town on the north shore of Long Island, New York. The town itself was created around 1885 as somewhere to live for the workers of the Kings Park Psychiatric Center, which opened that year. Then known as Kings County Asylum, it was an institution that housed some of the most psychologically ill and dangerous people, with a patient census of 9,303 in 1954. But after closing down in 1996, ending a 111-year-run, the sprawling 13-story hospital sits abandoned, towering over the tiny town. The ruins of Long Island¿s Kings Park Psychiatric Center - which have been abandoned since 1996 - are often described as the perfect setting for a horror movie, and several have been shot there . Old patient beds can be seen sitting dormant at the site, which has become a mecca for trespassing, graffiti and vandalism . Spooky: Kings County Asylum followed the farm colony model popular at the time, designed as a self-sufficient community where residents were put to work raising crops and livestock to support the sprawling campus. The labor was thought to be therapeutic . Throughout its history, Kings Park was notable for staying on the cutting edge of psychological science, cementing its place in history as an early adopter and proponent of a succession of new procedures and medications that eventually led to the institution¿s decline, such as the lobotomy . The lobotomy is remembered as one of the most grotesque treatment methods of the era, in which a metal tool was inserted through the eye socket into the skull cavity, and wrenched around to sever the connections of the pre-frontal cortex from the rest of the brain . Today, covered in vines, the decaying hospital stands as a constant reminder to the residents of Kings Park about what their town is built around . Layers of colored paint peel from a hallway of isolation rooms . In the first half of the 20th century, the psychological community was in a state of desperation, charged with the task of caring for a growing number of mentally ill patients with few treatment options available aside from psychotherapy and the rampant use of restraints and confinement . Each floor was nearly identical, with subtle variations in color and layout . According to the blog Abandoned NYC, Kings Park was known for its controversial use of psychological science, pioneering new procedures and medications throughout history, which inevitably led to the institutions decline. In the first half of the 20th century, the psychological community was in a state of desperation, charged with the task of caring for a growing number of mentally ill patients with few treatment options available aside from psychotherapy and the rampant use of restraints and confinement. Once a patient was admitted to an asylum, they had no right to give or deny consent for treatment. The 1940s saw the rise of two groundbreaking but brutual procedures - shock therapy and the lobotomy. Shock therapy was conceived when doctors observed that the mood of epileptic patients suffering from depression improved after a seizure, so the procedure attempted to replicate these benefits by inducing a seizure through electricity or insulin injection. Electroconvulsive therapy, as it’s known today, is still considered an effective treatment, even having a resurgence in recent years. The lobotomy is remembered as one of the most grotesque treatment methods of the era. It was a simple procedure, in which a metal tool was inserted through the eye socket into the skull cavity, and wrenched around to sever the connections of the pre-frontal cortex from the rest of the brain. It was an imprecise and brutal operation, which left lobotomized individuals with no trace of their former selves. The development of effective antipsychotic medication in the mid-1950s signaled the decline of these extreme measures and the institution system as a whole. For the first time, residents once considered hopeless were able to manage their mental illness and live independently because of medication, leading to a dramatic shift in institutions across the country from severe overcrowding to near-abandonment. Despite a population boom post World War II,  by the early 1990s, the Kings Park Psychiatric Center was operating as a ghost of its former self, with many of the buildings being shut down or reduced in usage. Eventually, the remaining patients were transferred the and the center closed in 1996. Apart from numerous documentaries, several horror movies have been filmed at the site, including Blood Night: The Legend of Mary Hatchet in 2009 and Peripheral Vision in 2010. Kings County Asylum operated from 1885 until 1996, when the State of New York closed the facility, releasing its few remaining patients or transferring them to the still-operational Pilgrim Psychiatric Center . Post-World War II, Kings Park and the other Long Island asylums would see their patient populations soar. In 1954, the patient census at Kings Park topped 9,303, but would begin a steady decline afterwards . The hospital stopped the use of controversial procedures in 1955 following the introduction of Thorazine, the first widely used medication in the treatment of mental illness . Old tables remain in one of the cafeteria rooms . Alot of furniture and equipment were left behind on the ground floor of the building .

"The Los Angeles Police Department is launching an internal investigation into the arrest of a Django Unchained actress who claims she was stopped by cops who thought she was a prostitute. Daniele Watts' boyfriend Brian Lucas filmed her crying as she was handcuffed and questioned by police for simply kissing her partner in public. Police also questioned Lucas and asked him questions like 'Do you really know her?' - seemingly insinuating that Watts was soliciting. The couple described the humiliating incident to Buzzfeed, saying they were kissing in Lucas' car outside the CBS Studio Center in Studio City on Thursday when someone in a nearby office walked by and told them to stop. 'A Caucasian guy in a business suit comes downstairs and says, 'Can you guys stop putting on a show? I have people who are trying to work up there,'"" Watts told ABC 7. Humiliating: Django Unchained actress Daniele Watts (left) was stopped by police in Los Angeles last week after she was reported for kissing her boyfriend Brian Lucas (right). She claims police thought she was a prostitute . The Los Angeles Police Department has long been accused of using racial profiling in their arrests . A 2008 study conducted by Yale economist Professor Ian Ayres found that blacks are three times more likely to be stopped in L.A. than whites. The study also found that of 1,200 complaints of racial profiling over a five-year period, none of the officers were actually found guilty of the charge and disciplined. And this isn't the only time in recent weeks that the LAPD has been accused of racial profiling. Last month, a black film and television producer was arrested on his way to an Emmy party and held for six hours by police who thought he was a robbery suspect. The producer, 51-year-old Charles Belk, was later released when officers realized he had nothing to do with the crime. Last year, the LAPD launched a program to address these complaints, bringing officers and the citizens who accuse them of profiling together for mediated talks. Officers who participated in the so-called 'Community-employee education pilot program' are rewarded by having the internal investigation into the incident dropped. Watts says she was fully dressed and only kissing when police were called to the scene, and asked for the couple's identification. Lucas handed police his ID, but Watts refused and started walking away from the scene. 'I didn't have the stomach for someone on a power trip when I knew I hadn't done anything wrong,' Watts told Buzzfeed. That's when police stopped and handcuffed her, bringing her back to the scene where the couple was questioned. Lucas found the kinds of questions troubling. 'How do you know her, what relationship, they were questions that quite frankly made me feel like that they were questioning me being like the client of a prostitute,' Lucas said. 'He didn't say anything ever about that, I just felt that energy from it.' Watts was eventually let go after providing photo ID. While the LAPD initially refused to comment on the incident, since there had been no official arrest, they have since released a statement saying they are investigating. They said two officers were dispatched to the scene on a report of 'indecent exposure' and briefly detained the two individuals. 'Upon further investigation it was determined that no crime had been committed. Ms. Watts and her companion were subsequently released,' police said. News of the arrest spread after the couple wrote about it on their social media accounts. Watts wrote on her Facebook page: 'Today I was handcuffed and detained by 2 police officers from the Studio City Police Department after refusing to agree that I had done something wrong by showing affection, fully clothed, in a public place.' She also posted a photo of crying as she stood in the street wearing patterned shorts, a t-shirt with 'New York' written on it and running shoes with a  policeman next to her. Watts, who plays Martin Lawrence's daughter on the new FX comedy Partners, continued: 'When the officer arrived, I was standing on the sidewalk by a tree. Django Unchained actress Daniele Watts is claiming she was 'handcuffed and detained' by police after being mistaken for a prostitute as she kissed her white boyfriend.

Watts and her boyfriend Brian James Lucas claim that they were kissing on a Hollywood street when police were called and they were asked to show their ID card to which Watts refused . Watts posted the news on her Facebook page and said her arm was cut when she was handcuffed . Watt's boyfriend wrote: 'So they handcuffed her and threw her roughly into the back of the cop car until they could figure out who she was. In the process of handcuffing her, they cut her wrist' The pair both wrote about the alleged incident on their respective Facebook pages . Happy: The couple pictured above in a photo posted to Watts' Facebook . 'I was talking to my father on my cell phone.

He wrote: 'From the questions that he asked me as D was already on her phone with her dad, I could tell that whoever called on us (including the officers), saw a tatted RAWKer white boy and a hot bootie shorted black girl and thought we were a H* (prostitute) & a TRICK (client).

"A New York City real-estate mogul has filed a lawsuit against the architect who designed his Southampton mansion five feet too low. In papers filed in the Manhattan Supreme Court, Laurence Gluck claims James R. McDonough shortchanged the structure of crucial attic space. Gluck, who leads Stellar Management in New York City, purchased two side-by-side Southampton properties for $6 million in 2012. Size matters: Laurence Gluck says his Southampton mansion was designed five feet too low . He then hired McDonough to design him a seven-bedroom, 12-bathroom home complete with fireplaces, garage, tennis court, pool and cabana for a further $6.5 million. However, once construction was completed on the home, Gluck discovered that the height of the house fell short by five feet. According to the New York Post, Gluck's lawsuit claims that McDonough erred by counting the house's chimneys against Southampton's 32-foot height limit, meaning the roof is only 27 feet. The suit claims the shorter roof height leaves 'virtually no attic space or room to run duct work throughout the second floor.' McDonough denies Gluck's charges unequivocally. 'Absolutely not,' he told the New York Post. 'The height of the house was never once discussed.' Gluck says the alleged error has 'substantially delayed' the completion of his new home and is seeking $500,000 in compensation.

"Dame Judi Dench claims acting has become elitist as many young people cannot afford to attend drama school or the theatre. The Oscar-winning actress reveals she is inundated with requests for help from youngsters wanting to enter the profession. The 79-year-old actress said: ‘Anyone who’s in the theatre gets letters countless times a week asking for help to get through drama school. You can do so much, but you can’t do an endless thing. It is very expensive.’ Dame Judi Dench said that financial barriers to training are making the acting profession elitist . Dame Judi, who attended the private Mount School in York where fees cost £8,700 a year, said that financial barriers to training have made the profession more elitist since the demise of repertory theatre. She said it is vital for youngsters to learn by watching professional stage performances, but recognises the high costs of tickets. ‘I always say to young students, “Go and see as much as you possibly can”, which is what we used to do,’ she told The Observer. ‘But then we paid a pittance for sitting in the gods.’ It follows a plethora of public school-educated stars who have emerged in Hollywood films and TV series. Birdsong star Eddie Redmayne, Homeland’s Damian Lewis, The Wire’s Dominic West and War Horse actor Tom Hiddlestone all attended Eton College. Damian Lewis, who played Sergeant Nicholas Brody in hit series Homeland, is one of a string of successful actors who attended Eton College .","Oscar-winning actress says financial barriers have made profession elitist .

"Miss Nebraska may not have won the crown at this year's Miss America pageant, but she certainly left a lasting impression on viewers when she accidentally flashed the audience during the live broadcast. Megan Swanson, 21, of Omaha, Nebraska, was seated directly behind host Chris Harrison when she leaned over to chat with one of her fellow contestants at the start of  the evening wear portion of the competition Sunday evening, and forgot to keep her legs together, giving all of America a look up her short black skirt.

"Americans with accounts on President Barack Obama's health insurance enrollment website, HealthCare.gov, were advised that their passwords had been reset to guard against the ""Heartbleed"" bug, in a message posted on the site on Saturday. The warning marks the latest fallout from the widespread security bug, which surfaced this month and allows hackers to steal data online without a trace. Companies from Amazon.com Inc to Google Inc. have been forced to take steps to protect against Heartbleed. A message on HealthCare.gov said users who visited the website would need to create a new password to access their accounts. Taking precautions: The Homeland Security Department is conducting a security review of the federal government's websites, and, administrative officials maintain that no Obamacare vulnerabilities have turned up, they are urging users to reset their passwords as a precaution . 'While there's no indication that any personal information has ever been at risk, we have taken steps to address Heartbleed issues and reset consumers' passwords out of an abundance of caution,' said the message posted on Saturday. The Heartbleed security flaw is a 'catastrophic bug' believed to affect two out of every three Web servers, according to the Electronic Freedom Foundation. HealthCare.gov, a health insurance exchange for the 36 states that opted out of creating their own state insurance exchanges, was created under Obama's signature health care law, the 2010 Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. The website's launch last fall was dogged by complaints that many users could not access the site to buy insurance or research healthcare plan options. Security experts are warning that the Heartbleed bug allows the stealing of certain information that is normally protected . Most of the website's most prominent flaws were eventually remedied. Obama on Thursday announced in the White House briefing room that 8 million people had signed up by the latest enrollment deadline of April 15. The program's original goal was 7 million signups by the end of March, which was met. Republicans have been relentless in their criticism of the healthcare law ahead of November's congressional elections, when the GOP hopes to reclaim control of the U.S. Senate and strengthen its majority in the House of Representatives. Some 8 million people signed up by the latest Obamacare enrollment deadline of April 15, the White House announced this week . Critics of Obama's health initiative have suggested HealthCare.gov might be vulnerable to security flaws. The Heartbleed bug exploits a glitch in a widely used Web encryption program known as OpenSSL. It has not affected only corporations. Canada's tax-collection agency said this month that the private information of hundreds of people had been compromised as hackers exploited the Heartbleed bug.","Administrators encouraging HealthCare.gov users to change their passwords .

"High heels may make you feel sexy but — and it’s a big but — they often fail the most basic of shoe requirements: to get you from A to B. According to top shoe designer Penelope Chilvers, whose fans include the Duchess of Cambridge, Cate Blanchett, Elle Macpherson and Claudia Schiffer, there’s a radical solution: ditch heels, because flat shoes can actually look far better. And she knows what she’s talking about: Penelope was the designer who finally got Kate out of her famous LK Bennett nude heels and into a pair of tasselled Spanish riding boots. ‘You simply walk taller in flats,’ Penelope says. ‘You feel comfortable in them, so you’re able to walk with more confidence, keeping your spine straight, so giving you better posture. ‘Plus, they work for every occasion; I’m 5ft 2in and I wear them everywhere — even to weddings.’ To show just how versatile flats can be, here Penelope picks some of the best designs around this season and matches them with the outfits that show them off best . . . Scroll down for video . CANKLE HIDERS . The height of these boots is perfect to hide a cankle — where the calf looks a similar thickness to the ankle. The stretch panel makes them easy to pull on, and means you have a bit of give for comfort. They have a small, 5cm heel that lifts you very slightly, but means you can still leap about. Wear them with jeans, trousers, skirts just below the knee or maxi dresses. Boots, £269, penelopechilvers.com . Sweater, £45, marksandspencer.com . Faux leather skirt, £35.99, zara.com .

Look out for gems, bright colours and unusual shapes. This great pair of patent pumps are slick and chic with a very slight gold heel, which will give you a lift, while still being practical. They are smart enough for work, but still feminine, thanks to the front bow detail. Burgundy will be one of the colours this winter, and looks great against black and grey.

A V&A exhibition about Oscar Wilde, among others, inspired me to design them.

"Stroke, pictured, could affect patients' moral compass, altering the way they think about errors and intentions, a new study has found . Stoke could affect patients' moral compass, altering they way they think about mistakes and people's intentions, a new study has found. Scientists in Buenos Aires found those victims who suffered a stroke affecting the frontal region of the brain were more likely to forgive, as long as no actual harm was done. The study concluded the effect on moral judgement was similar to those patients diagnosed with frontotemporal dementia (FTD). It found the stroke patients placed more emphasis on the outcome of a situation, focusing less on what a person's intentions were. Agustin Ibanez, of the Institute of Congitive Neurology in the Argentinian capital, and his team, said: 'For both disorders, patients judged scenarios where the protagonists believed that they would cause harm but did not as being more permissible than the control group. Altogether, 'the performance of both groups is characterised by an over-reliance on outcome rather than by the integration of intentions and outcomes,' everydayhealth.com reported. Researchers compared eight patients who had suffered stroke in the frontal region of the brain, and 19 patients believed to be suffered frontotemporal dementia, and an equal number of healthy, control patients. None of the study participants had been diagnosed with any other psychiatric disorders, neurological diseases or had suffered brain damage. They were presented four different scenarios. They involved no intended or actual harm, accidental harm, unsuccessfully-attempted harm, and successfully-attempted harm. Both those patients who had suffered a stroke or had FTD rated the scenario in which harm was intended but not actually caused as more acceptable, than the control group. The patients with FTD also deemed accidental harm as less acceptable than the control group and stroke patients. The researchers added: 'The results of this study suggest that the moral judgement abnormalities in both groups are related to an impaired integration of intentions and outcomes.' Dr Ibanez, told medicalresearch.com: 'Both patients with the behavioral variant of frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD) and patients with frontal strokes presented moral judgment abnormalities. 'Their deficits were related to impairments in the integration of intentions and outcomes. 'Specifically, both patient groups judged moral scenarios by focusing on the actions’ outcomes instead of the protagonists’ intentions.'

"According to a recently released study, the average American household has access to nearly 200 cable television channels - and most of those households only actually watch fewer than 20 of them. On Tuesday, Nielsen released its Advertising and Audience report, which found that the average U.S. home had access to 189 cable channels in 2013 - a big jump 2008, when the average household had about 129 channels. According to Nielsen's study, the average American only watches about 17 of the 189 television channels that they pay for, which has technology analysts concluding that cable customers are getting much less value for their money than they have in the past. Cable bill: The average American pays for 172 cable television channels that they don't actually watch . 'Cable companies keep adding more channels to watch and keep increasing . the price we pay month after month, yet we still only watch the same . channels,' technology consultant Jeff Kagan tells Marketwatch.com. 'We pay roughly double this year compared to what we . paid ten years ago.' The national average bill for cable customers is about $90 per month - which has nearly doubled since 2003. By 2020, experts estimate that the average cable bill will be more in the neighborhood of $200 per month. The study concludes that more content - or television channels - doesn't result in increased channel consumption. The numbers should be a sign to advertisers and content creators that quality is crucial because consumers have so many options in terms of what type of programming they view. Streaming: Many Americans have ditched cable altogether and are replacing it with less expensive video streaming services like Netflix . 'This data is significant in that it substantiates the notion that more . content does not necessarily equate to more channel consumption,' Nielsen explains in its report. 'And that means quality is imperative -- for both . content creators and advertisers. So the best way to reach consumers in a . world with myriad options is to be the best option.' This is a crucial time for cable providers, as many former customers have opted to 'cut the cord' and ditch cable TV altogether rather than pay for more than 100 channels they don't watch - many media consumers are now using video streaming services like Netflix and Roku rather than rely on the cable company. Currently, a subscription to Netflix costs $7.99 per month.","The average American has access to 189 cable TV channels .

"The Obama administration says its healthcare.gov website is much improved and far less crash-prone, but cybersecurity experts warn that using it is an invitation to hackers and identity thieves. David Kennedy, a former NSA analyst whose company TrustedSec is hired by big companies to test the security of their computer systems, told CNBC that the Obamacare website is a worst-case online scenario. 'It's really hard to go back and fix the security around it because security wasn't built into it,' Kennedy said. 'We're talking multiple months to over a year to at least address some of the critical-to-high exposures on the website itself.' Morgan Wright, CEO of Crowd Sourced Investigations, went further, saying that the entire Affordable Care Act enrollment website should be scrapped and rebuilt from scratch with a proper security backbone in place. 'There's not a plan to fix this that meets the sniff test of being reasonable,' said Wright. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . TrustedSec CEO David Kennedy said it would take 'multiple months to over a year to at least address some of the critical-to-high exposures on the website itself' Signing on to healthcare.gov is easier now, but signing up could expose taxpayers to hackers or identity thieves, experts say . He and Kennedy testified last month in a House Science Committee hearing that examined whether consumers' personal information would be safe on healthcare.gov's servers. The consensus was overwhelming. 'Americans should be scared to death,' warned Utah GOP Rep. Chris Stewart. Alabama Rep. Mo Brooks, another Republican, said providing the federal government's untested website with Social Security numbers, income levels, mortgage information, dates of birth and home addresses would create 'a mother lode for identity theft.' 'There's not a plan to fix this that meets the sniff test of being reasonable,' said cybersecurity CEO Morgan Wright . 'It's not only Social Security numbers,' Kennedy agreed. 'It’s one of the largest collections of personal data, social security and everything else, that we’ve ever seen.' Brooks asked the panel whether they think the public can use the Obamacare website safely. 'Given healthcare.gov’s security issues, and assuming for the moment that you would be personally responsible for all damages incurred from your advice,' he asked, 'would any of you advise an American citizen to use this website as the security issues now exist?' 'No,' replied all four, including Kennedy and Wright. Three of the witnesses agreed that the site should be shut down and rebuilt. Kennedy told CNBC that that 15 state-level health insurance exchange websites, including one run by the District of Columbia, are equally vulnerable and will be 'a large area for attack.' He pointed to a problem on the Vermont website on Friday. On Nov. 22, officials in charge of the Vermont Health Connect website admitted that one user was shown the personal information of another – including a Social Security number. In another case, a government website delivered a South Carolina man's personal information to an unrelated person in North Carolina. President Obama returned to campaign mode on Tuesday, trying to re-sell the Affordable Care Act to the American people amid concerns that its flagship website is unworkable and lacks security features . A Nov. 19 House Science Committee hearing found that none of the four witnesses would recommend healthcare.gov as a safe website for consumers to use .","CEOs from computer security firms say it would take a year or more to plug healthcare.gov's security holes – if it can be done at all .

"Scotland will not join the euro for ‘the foreseeable future’ if it breaks away from the rest of the UK, Alex Salmond insisted today. The Scottish First Minister was forced to repeatedly defend his claim that if voters back independence in next year’s referendum it will not mean having to reapply to join the European Union. And he went further, claiming it was ‘simply incredible’ to think Brussels would not welcome the new independent nation with open arms. First minister Alex Salmond insisted the European Union would welcome 'oil-rich, fishing-rich, renewable energy-rich Scotland' This week Parliament is due to sign off the rules for holding the independence referendum in autumn 2014. Questions about an independent Scotland’s place in the EU have dogged Mr Salmond for months, with the European Commission insisting a new nation would have to make a new application. But he said: 'This is a negotiation that will take place after the constitutional referendum of 2014, of course Scotland will still be a member of the UK and therefore, by definition, negotiating from within the European Union. 'The point of independence doesn’t happen until the transfer of sovereignty, which will happen before the Scottish elections in 2016. We’re talking about after the referendum of 2014, giving that time for negotiation.' Several countries including Spain have made clear it would block Scotland’s entry. But Mr Salmond said: ‘The idea that oil-rich, fishing-rich, renewable energy-rich Scotland will not be wanted as part of the European Union is simply incredible.’ He contrasted his enthusiasm for joining the EU with David Cameron's move, in a speech this Friday, to renegotiate powers back from Brussels. Mr Salmond’s Scottish National Party has previously backed the idea of Scotland joining the single currency, but today he ruled it out. ‘There’s no prospect of them being members of the euro and currently and for the foreseeable future there’s no prospect of Scotland, an independent Scotland, being a member of the euro,' he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. ‘What there is every prospect of is that oil-rich, fishing-rich, renewable energy-rich Scotland will certainly be wanted in the European Union and it’s also the case that a country which actually wants to be part of the European Union is more likely to end up as part of the European Union.’ MPs last night tonight agreed to hand the Scottish Parliament the powers it needs to hold the referendum on independence. Prime Minister David Cameron and Scottish First Minister Alex Salmond agreed a deal to stage a referendum in autumn 2014 . The Government's order, which hands power to Holyrood to hold the poll in the autumn of next year, now needs to be approved by the House of Lords today. The order was passed unopposed by MPs as Scottish Secretary Michael Moore told the House of Commons the ‘great debate’ about whether Scotland could now separate from the rest of the United Kingdom could begin. He said the legal order would give the Scottish Parliament the legal, fair and decisive referendum pledged in the Edinburgh Agreement and signed by Mr Salmond and Mr Cameron last year. Mr Moore said: ‘Deciding Scotland's future within the UK will be the most important decision we as Scots take in our lifetime. ‘It is now essential the referendum decision is focused on determining whether Scotland chooses to remain an integral part of the most successful partnership of nations the world has ever seen, to remain part of a family of nations that works in the interests of all - or whether Scotland wishes to leave and go it alone.’","Scottish First Minister rejects the idea of independent nation having to join single currency .

"A grandfather died in agony and begging for pain relief after doctors failed to spot he had seven broken ribs, his family say. Peter Bellinger, 77, slipped on ice outside his home and was admitted to Blackpool Victoria Hospital in  Lancashire, where he was left undiagnosed and untreated for days, it is claimed. By the time staff realised his ribs were fractured, he had contracted pneumonia, which led to blood poisoning. Grandfather Peter Bellinger, 77, (left) died in 2010 after doctors failed to treat the seven broken ribs that led to him contracting pneumonia and blood poisoning. His wife, Angela (right) said she fears conditions at the hospital have not improved . The hospital trust in charge of Mr Bellinger's care has admitted that mistakes were made and have apologised to his family . Pneumonia can develop after rib fractures if patients are not breathing deeply enough. NHS bosses at Blackpool Teaching Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, who are charged with running the hospital, admitted that failings by medical staff led to Mr Bellinger's death in 2010. The hospital has admitted the care Mr Bellinger received 'fell below the standard expected' but insisted improvements in the care of pneumonia and sepsis have been made, and staff levels are being improved. But Mr Bellinger's family say they fear conditions have not improved enough. In April this year, the Care Quality Commission (CQC), which is in charge of inspecting hospitals, released a damning report about care at the hospital. After an inspection, five of the eight departments at the hospital were rated as either 'inadequate' or 'requiring improvement'. Although it was found that the trust had undertaken work on improving clinical pathways, the CQC said the trust's  reporting of accidents and near misses was not good, the quality of patient notes were poor and information on patients was difficult to access. The trust is also currently undergoing an investigation into why it has a higher rate of significant bleeding after childbirth. Mr Bellinger's daughter Michelle Lunn, 49, from Thornton, Lancashire, said failures at the hospital meant her father died in agony. She said: 'I only saw my father cry twice in his life. 'Once was when his own mother died, the other was when he cried in pain, begging for pain medication at the hospital. 'My mother has never been the same. They were joined at the hip. Mr Bellinger's daughter, Michelle Lunn, 49, said her father went from a man who loved going on holiday with his wife (left) to dying in agony, 'crying for pain medication' 'When he died she lost her right hand. He was a fit and healthy man and was well known in Blackpool. 'He used to love travelling and going away on holiday with mum. He shouldn't have died after breaking a few ribs.' She said the family want to see improvements so others don't die in this way. She said: 'If he had been looked after properly, he would still be with us, looking after us all and enjoying time with his family and friends. 'No apology can ever make up for what has happened. We just want to make sure it doesn't happen again and no-one has to go through what we have. 'We will never stop missing him.' A report from the Care Quality Commission from April found that five of the eight departments at the hospital  were rated as either 'inadequate' or 'requiring improvement' A spokesperson for Blackpool Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust said: 'The Trust has extended its deepest apologies and condolences to the family of Mr Bellinger and acknowledged failings in this case. 'We fully accept that the delivery of care received by Mr Bellinger, and his family, fell below the standard expected and a full admission has been made in that respect. 'We would like to assure both Mr Bellinger's family, and our residents, that we have made significant improvements since 2010 which were acknowledged and commended by the CQC inspection of the Trust in January 2014. 'This included advances in new care pathways for both pneumonia and sepsis and improvements in staffing levels and reductions in mortality rates. 'Patient safety is the Trust's continuing number one priority and we are dedicated to learning lessons at all times to make sure we provide the highest possible standards of safety and care.'","Peter Bellinger, 77, from Blackpool, slipped on some ice outside his home .

Authorities say they still don't know what caused more than 200 girls in El Carmen de Bolivar to come down with symptoms ranging from fainting to numbness in the hands and headaches. Some have hinted that the town of 95,000 near Colombia's Caribbean coast could be experiencing a rare case of mass hysteria. Mystery: Authorities say they don't know what caused more than 200 girls in El Carmen de Bolivar to grow ill. But parents say they were all injected with a vaccine against cervical cancer (stock image) Parents are on edge however because all the girls, ranging in ages from 9 to 16, were injected in recent months with the vaccine Gardasil. On Wednesday, residents marched peacefully to demand a thorough investigation. Francisco Vega, the town's mayor and a trained physician, told The Associated Press that illnesses first appeared at the end of May and have been steadily increasing since. Over the weekend 120 girls were rushed to hospitals, collapsing the town's limited medical facilities. None of their symptoms were life-threatening and all have since been released, he said. Echoing the assurances of national health and toxicology experts, who have travelled to the town to collect blood samples and investigate possible environmental hazards, he said there's no evidence the vaccine, which has undergone extensive testing and regulation globally, is to blame. 'It's not our drug': Merck, the U.S. drug manufacturer which makes Gardasil, said all lots of the vaccine, including the ones sent to Colombia, meet all required quality and safety standards . Meanwhile, Health Minister Alejandro Gaviria is criticizing hyped coverage by the media for stirring panic, saying concerns about their vaccine, which has been applied to 2.9 million women in Colombia, are baseless. 'On one side we have the weight of scientific evidence and on the other are opinions and moral prejudices,' he told W Radio on Wednesday, adding the cervical cancer claims the lives of more than 3,000 women every year in Colombia. Veronica Trulin, head of communications in Latin America for Merck, said all lots of the vaccine, including the ones sent to Colombia, meet all required quality and safety standards. 'We don't comment on speculation about our products,' she said in an email .","200 girls have come down with symptoms from faintness to numb hands .

"'World's greatest hacker': Kevin Mitnick is a renowned former cybercriminal who now works to stop suck crimes. He says the security built into healthcare.gov is 'shameful' A man who was once the FBI's most wanted hacker says Healthcare.gov  is a cybercriminal's dream. Kevin Mitnick has been a legend in the hacking world since his 1990s heydays, but he's now playing for the good guys and sent a dire message to a congressional security panel on the ObamaCare website on Thursday. 'It's shameful the team that built the Healthcare.gov site implemented minimal, if any, security best practices,' he wrote in a letter submitted to panel chairman Lamar Smith, a Texas Republican. Mitnick served five years in prison for hacking into corporate computers and stealing software after a three-year cat and mouse game with federal authorities. After he got out in 2000, he put his unparalleled hacking prowess to use helping the sorts of companies he once burglarized. 'it's clear that the management team did not consider security as a priority,' said the Las Vegas-based security expert. In 2011, Mitnick told America his tale of intrigue and technological feats in the memoir Ghost in the Wires. Now he's telling the nation to watch out for people like him out to exploit he site's shoddy security. Mitnick was backed up by CEO of consulting firm TrustedSec LLC David Kennedy. 'HealthCare.gov is not secure today,' Kennedy told the House Science, Space and Technology Committee. HealthCare.gov is the consumer web portal to a 36-state federal health insurance marketplace, which offers private insurance, with federally subsidized rates for some consumers. The 14 other states have built their own marketplaces. 'It's shameful the team that built the Healthcare.gov site implemented minimal, if any, security best practices to mitigate the significant risk of a system compromise,' said Mitnick, who served five years in prison for his crimes . Mitnick told America his story of cyber intrigue in the 2011 memoir Ghost in the Wires. Now, by writing a letter of warning to Congress, he's telling the nation to watch out for people like him . Kennedy said 'nothing has really changed' since a hearing of the same committee in November, when he and three other expert witnesses said they believed the site was not secure and three of them said it should be shut down immediately. 'I don't understand how we're still discussing whether the website is insecure or not,' said Kennedy, who worked for the National Security Agency and the U.S. Marine Corps before entering the private sector. 'It is insecure -- 100 percent.' Before the hearing, Kennedy told Reuters the government has yet to plug more than 20 vulnerabilities that he and other security experts reported to the government shortly after HealthCare.gov went live on October 1. Hackers could steal personal information, modify data, attack the personal computers of website users and damage the infrastructure of the site, Kennedy said in an interview. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), the federal agency responsible for HealthCare.gov, said in a statement to Reuters, 'There have been no successful security attacks on Healthcare.gov and no person or group has maliciously accessed personally identifiable information from the site.' CMS said Kennedy's methodology undermined his findings: 'Because this individual had no direct access to the operations of the HealthCare.gov website, the information in the report is based on assumptions, not fact.' The agency's information security chief also publicly tried to reassure lawmakers that the site is safe. The CMS chief information security officer, Teresa Fryer, said the website underwent end-to-end security testing on December 18 and met all industry standards. 'The (federal marketplace) is secure. In many instances, we have gone above and beyond what is required, with layered protection, continuous monitoring and additional penetration testing,' Fryer said before the House Oversight panel. As the hearings took place, Republicans sought to amplify their anti-Obamacare message by advancing another bill to tweak the law. The legislation, which passed by a 259-154 vote, would require the Obama administration to issue weekly enrollment statistics. The White House considers the transparency bill another Republican attempt to hamstring implementation of its healthcare reform. However, 33 Democrats voted for the measure, as some Democrats are eager to cast targeted votes critical of the healthcare program, in case they think they need it during their election campaigns. Last week, the House passed a Republican measure that would require the government to notify Americans within two days if their personal information on HealthCare.gov has been compromised.","Kevin Mitnick says creators of the troubled site 'did not consider security as a priority'

"The first day of The View's earthshaking new host lineup saw the triumphant return of cantankerous former emcee Rosie O'Donnell after an eight-year absence, along with two completely new co-hosts who will no-doubt make this relaunch one of the most memorable yet. Appearing for the first time on the panel was token blonde Nicolle Wallace, who conservative credentials beat even Bush-loving Elisabeth Hasselbeck since Wallace actually worked for George W. And in the third corner, the wildcard: known for her voice as much as for her no-holds-barred New York City attitude--actress Rosie Perez. Scroll down for video . Shoeless: Rosie was sure to get a pedicure over fears her unkempt feet might draw attention from the new improved show as she recovered from some sciatica. The first day of The View's earthshaking new host lineup saw the triumphant return of the cantankerous former emcee after an eight-year absence, along with two completely new co-hosts who will no-doubt make this relaunch one of the most memorable yet . Two Rosies! Rosie O'Donnell is back after a contentious exit and several years absence and she's brought another Rosie with her--actress and activist Rosie Perez . Barbara gave her blessing: The queen herself made an appearance in a pre-taped segment as the ladies of her show held court and each kissed her hand . But don't expect too many screaming matches or claims that the world is flat (here's looking at you Sherri Shepherd): O'Donnell says the new View will be smarter, calmer and an all-around better show. The live show began calmly, with introductions and a nod to creator and news media queen Barbara Walters, who held court from a throne and had her hand kissed by each of the hostesses, including the only one remaining from the previous season, Whoopi Goldberg. 'Welcome to the newer view,' joked Whoopi, before introducing Rosie O'Donnell. O'Donnell kicked things off by catching up with viewers, including a discussion of her heartache and the gastric bypass surgery that followed. Up next, an introduction of the other Rosie--actress Rosie Perez, who plugged her upcoming Broadway show and memoir. Then came Nicolle Wallace: former George W. Bush press secretary for six years. 'I am a Republican, I should get that out of the way,' she said through a smile to audience uproar on both sides of the aisle. Before things got too out of control, fiery liberal Rosie O'Donnell piped in: 'And I like her, I swear!' True to form, though, the group jumped right into a contentious topic--the Ray Rice domestic abuse saga and further questions over child and sex abuse. 'All about money, all about the brand being jeopardized,' politico Wallace chimed in first on the Rice issue. Perez agreed there's no excuse for hitting women, used her sports hero, convicted abuser Floyd Mayweather, to make the point that one's environment could be at fault as much as the individual.'[You] Respond the way you were taught,' said the actress. But should one continue to support the likes of Mayweather and Rice by paying for event tickets? O'Donnell didn't think so. 'I haven't seen a Woody Allen movie since the allegations came out,' O'Donnell said, moving the conversation along to her own struggles with abuse. Though she did say she continues to appreciate Chris Brown as an artist, despite his violent past. Values clash? Whoopi is back, of course, but a woman with decidedly different politics from hers is on this year, too. Not just a mom-first, mouthy conservative like former host Elisabeth Hasselbeck, new token blonde conservative Nicolle Wallace actually worked George W's White House . Pulling her weight: All the ladies on the panel were fascinated as former Bush staffer turned Sarah Palin wrangler recalled her days in the controversial White House and ill-fated McCain campaign trail . Perez and O'Donnell introduced a new audience participation game they will play each day together, a play on their identical names called Ro or Ro? In the game, the audience members tries to win a prize by deciding which Rosie does the thing being described on a card. In one of the inaugural game's questions, O'Donnell asked which of the Rosies practices tae kwon do. 'O'Donnell!' replied the contestant. 'Wrong,' O'Donnell belowed to the young lady's chagrin. With two comedians and a funny lady actress on the panel, the group also addressed the recent tragic deaths of Robin Williams and Joan Rivers. 'I've been at that place,' O'Donnell said, empathizing with her depression-plagued late friend Robin Williams. O'Donnell suggested that, for the depressed, leaving grieving children behind isn't enough to stop someone bent on suicide. Ask Me Anything: A new segment gave the ladies and their viewers some time to catch up and get to know the panel--for instance: Wallace hates Hillary, Rosie O'Donnell has a gastric bypass, Perez has a forthcoming memoir, and Whoopi, well, she's been enjoying her shoes . Another new segment came in the form of an audience participation game called Ro or Ro? where contestants must decide which Rosie is being described on a card . Loss but a win: While this episode's contestant lost Ro or Ro? with only one correct answer, the game did reveal a little known and astonishing fact about Perez--she practices tae kwon do! When the topic had turned to politics, all eyes turned to Wallace. 'Hillary Clinton and I were not good friends,' she said as the group touched on the Clintons' recent trip to Iowa. She's definitely running 100 percent, though, said the Washington insider. While Hillary is today's hot topic, the group was more interested by far to hear Wallace's stories about her days as Sarah Palin's wrangler during the the McCain campaign. Wallace kept her cool but did reveal that Palin blamed her completely for the VP candidate's infamous interview with Katie Couric and said the candidate and aide's relationship was irreparably damaged that day in 2008. She also gave a comic rendition of the day she learned Vice President Cheney had shot a man during Bush II's already unpopular second term that left the ladies in stitches. The show concluded with a tribute to Rivers that began with a song in the comedienne's honor by Broadway diva Kristin Chenoweth. A best-of montage of some of Rivers' over 30 appearances then followed, to much applause and teary eyes. 'She gave and gave and gave,' Perez said as O'Donnell joked about the snarky comments Rivers made to her regarding her unconventionally feminine persona. 'Loved it,' she said. Big fans of Joan: The show concluded with a tearful tribute to a dear friend of the View, the recently passed Joan Rivers, who appeared on the show over 30 times . Tribute: Guest Kristin Chenoweth gave a beautiful tribute to Joan Rivers through song to help close out the show .","Rosie O'Donnell is back and promises a lot more smart talk and a lot less squabbling (and no mentions of the earth being flat)

"Kicking up a stink: People living in the small Welsh village of Varteg are protesting against plans to rename it 'Farteg' People living in the small Welsh village of Varteg are kicking up a stink about plans to rename it 'Farteg' - claiming it sounds like a 'schoolboy's playground insult'. Welsh language campaigners say the ancient name should be replaced because there is no 'V' in the ancient tongue of Wales. However, villagers fear they will be the butt of playground jokes if road signs are put up displaying the flatulent name. Sioned Jones, 42, who lives in the village near Pontypool, South Wales, said: 'Just imagine how embarrassing it will be to have the word ""fart"" in your village's name - never mind being followed by ""egg"". 'I'd be humiliated every time I told someone my address. Everyone will be laughing at us and coming to get photographed next to the street signs. 'I just think it's ridiculous - these Welsh language campaigners are a lot of gasbags, they’re full of hot air.' Fellow villager Ray Leyshon, 62, said: 'Can you imagine the bus going past and some naughty schoolboy shouting: ""You are going to Fart Egg"". It is just a bad joke.' Many road signs in Wales display place names in both English and Welsh - and Torfaen council is now consulting on which form should be used in Varteg, which has a population of about 1,000 people. Proposal: Welsh language campaigners are calling for the Welsh translation 'Farteg' to be added to road names and street signs in the village near Pontypool, South Wales . Butt of jokes: Villagers fear they will be ridiculed if road signs are put up displaying the flatulent name . Campaigners are calling for the Welsh . translation 'Farteg' to be added to road names and street signs in the . village. However, the idea has been slammed by Torfaen MP Paul Murphy, . who described the new name as 'dubious', . 'Why should people in Varteg be told how to spell their own place name?' he said. 'Varteg is not an English word so translating it is totally unnecessary. “It’s a name that reflects our rich history and culture in the Eastern Valley, with its Welsh language and English language influences. Debate: A Torfaen council spokesman said changing the village's current name to 'Farteg' would be 'inappropriate'. But the village could still have its name changed to 'Y Farteg' 'I’m supportive of sensible steps to . help the Welsh language, but this is not the way to achieve that - it . will only fuel resentment.' The Welsh alphabet traditionally consists of these 28 letters:a, b, c, ch, d, dd, e, f, ff, g, ng, h, i, l, ll, m, n, o, p, ph, r, rh, s, t, th, u, w, yThe letter 'j' is now often included in the alphabet, between the letters 'i' and 'l' A Torfaen council spokesman said changing the village's current name to 'Farteg' would be 'inappropriate'. However, village could still have its name changed to 'Y Farteg' - with locals now being consulted about this. The spokesman said: 'After discussion with the local councillor, 'Farteg' was considered inappropriate and was not adopted at the time. 'The Welsh language commissioner has proposed the alternative name “Y Farteg,” upon which the residents of the Varteg community will be able to express their views.' The hamlet of Shitterton in Dorset has been voted the UK's most unfortunate place name. The tiny collection of homes, which lies between Dorchester and Poole, is widely considered to be the most embarrassing place to live, according to a survey by www.findmypast.co.uk last year. Unlucky: The hamlet of Shitterton holds the title of the UK's most unfortunate place name . It beat the nearby valley of Scratchy Bottom, near Durdle Door in Dorset, and Brokenwind in Aberdeenshire. Shitterton is a very literal English translation of the village name recorded in Norman French in the 11th century Domesday Book as Scatera or Scetra. It means a little town that is on the stream of a midden or sewer. The unfortunately-named hamlet also beat off competition from Crapstone in Devon, Ugley in Essex, Back Passage in London, Sandy Balls in the New Forest, Old Sodbury in Gloucestershire and North Piddle in rural Worcestershire. Contenders for the UK's most unfortunate street name included Slag Lane in Haydock, Merseyside, Pratts Bottom in Kent and Hooker Road in Norwich.","Campaigners say the ancient name should be replaced because there is no 'V' in the Welsh language .

"As children they were inseparable, not just cousins but the best of friends. As adults, Laura Plane and Jade Popplewell have shared a unique experience, fighting breast cancer together. The cousins, both 34 and from Plymouth, endure chemotherapy together, go to hospital appointments with one another and step in to help when the other is facing a tough day. But while Jade should be given the all-clear later this year, Laura's future is less certain. Her disease is incurable having spread to her bones and spine. Cousins and best friends, Laura Plane, second left and Jade Popplewell, third left, are both fighting cancer. Laura was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2009, while Jade was diagnosed this year . The cousins, both now 34, were inseparable as children and are now helping each other through their disease. Jade credits Laura's tireless campaigning with encouraging her to check her breasts and detect her lump early enough for life-saving treatment. Doctors have said she should be cancer-free by the end of the year . The day Laura called her cousin to tell her the devastating news, Jade revealed she too had found a lump. She credits Laura's diagnosis and tireless campaigning, encouraging women to regularly check their breasts, with her early diagnosis - in time for life-saving treatment. Laura, a teacher, did not detect the tumours in her breast until the largest had grown to measure 7cm. She said: 'I found my cancer too late, but if everything goes to plan, Jade will be one of the lucky ones, I'm so pleased for her.' Laura discovered that her cancer had spread in February last year - at the same time that Jade had discovered a lump. Laura, who supports the charity CoppaFeel, said: 'When I found out that Jade had cancer too I couldn't believe that life could be so cruel. 'We're not just cousins - we're best friends - so the news was horrendous. 'But when we realised that her cancer was treatable because it had been discovered so early, it was a relief. 'To know that my work with CoppaFeel made Jade aware of the importance of checking your breasts was fantastic. Jade said: 'Before Laura had cancer I never checked my breasts, I didn't know I needed to. But for Laura, left, the future is less certain. In February last year, after suffering back pain, scans revealed her cancer had returned and spread to her bones and spine. Doctors have told her the disease is now incurable . Laura, pictured left during treatment, said: 'I found my cancer too late, but if everything goes to plan, Jade (far right, after having her head shaved) will be one of the lucky ones, I'm so pleased for her' Laura (right, aged six) discovered her cancer had spread in February last year - at the same time that Jade (left, also six) had discovered a lump in her breast . 'But with her charity work, she showed me how important it was. 'I was away working on a cruise ship when I found the lump while showering. 'Laura had Skyped me to tell me about her secondary cancer and in the same conversation I told her I'd found a lump. 'We were both so emotional - not only was I going through cancer, but so was my best friend. 'But if it wasn't for Laura, I wouldn't have found the lump as early as I did, she's helped to save my life.' Laura was first diagnosed with cancer five years ago. She said: 'I found it in March 2009 - I wasn't particularly checking my boobs, I think something just felt different. 'The idea of cancer never even crossed my mind. 'I hardly told anyone as I didn't want people to worry, but on a friend's hen do I told Jade. 'She told me to get it checked out, so I went to the doctors and was eventually told I had cancer. 'The day I found out Jade and I had planned to go to a Kings of Leon concert - Jade said we didn't have to go but I was determined to live my life as normal as possible despite having cancer so we went anyway. 'It was that point that I decided I was going to carry on as normal no matter what, and I have done ever since.' Laura was given the all clear from breast cancer in 2010 - she returned to work and got involved with CoppaFeel. But when her back began to ache almost four years later, doctors sent her for another scan. The cousins said they have always been close, growing up and holidaying together. But Jade (far right and top left) said fighting cancer together has brought them even closer . Jade said: 'Laura had skyped me to tell me about her secondary cancer and in the same conversation I told her I'd found a lump.'We were both so emotional - not only was I going through cancer, but so was my best friend' Laura (far left and far right) now has regular scans to monitor her disease, which is currently stable . Laura (right) said: 'I live my life normally - I still work, I have as much fun as I possibly can.' She has helped to raise more than £20,000 for the charity CoppaFeel, which encourages women to regularly check their breasts . Charity CoppaFeel say there is no right or wrong way for a woman to check her breasts. They advise women to know the signs and symptoms of breast cancer, check their breasts regularly and seek medical advice if a woman notices something that is abnormal for them. The charity advises to look out for: . One in eight women will experience breast cancer in their lifetime, with 400 men being diagnosed every year. Doctors revealed that the cancer had spread to Laura's bones and spine. It was then they told her the disease was incurable. 'I knew I could go one way or the other,' she said. 'I could either focus on what was wrong with me, or I could live my life. 'I now have regular scans to monitor the cancer and its growth and at the moment it's stable, but obviously it won't go away. 'But I live my life normally - I still work, I have as much fun as I possibly can, and so far we've raised more than £20,000 for CoppaFeel.' Now, the cousins continue to support each other throughout their illness. Jade said: 'On the days where I'm not so good, Laura will come round to mine, armed with sweets and DVDs, and chill out on the sofa, and I'll do the same for her. 'And if we're both feeling particularly good, we'll make sure we make the most of it and have fun. 'We go to hospitals and chemo with each other, we're always together. 'We've always been close, we grew up together and spent holidays together, but now we're even closer. The cousins now help each other through their illnesses.

My cancer was grade three aggressive, so if I hadn't have found it as early as I did, I may not be here' 'We both know exactly what the other is going through, so it's great to have someone to talk too. 'Because Laura has been through it all before she could tell me what to expect and prepare for it all. 'She gives me tips about wigs and things like that - just small things that make life a bit easier. 'I feel incredibly grateful to Laura for making me realise how important it was to check my breasts. 'My cancer was grade three aggressive, so if I hadn't have found it as early as I did, I may not be here.' Laura said: 'Early detection is just so important,' she said. 'When I found my lump it was 7cm, but when Jade found hers it was just 2.5cm. 'Now Jade is undergoing treatment and should be cancer free very soon, whereas for me there is no cure. 'Now I go around to schools and various groups to educate people on checking their breasts. 'Jade and I are proof that it can make a real difference. 'I always be thankful that I've played some part in ensuring my cousin is going to be ok.'

"Created: . 06:08 EST, 17 August 2014 . The family of Cliff Richard have defended the singer, who is currently being investigated over an alleged sexual assault on a boy under the age of 16 at a religious event in 1985. Sir Cliff’s cousin Garth Gregory, 59, branded the police raid on the singer’s Berkshire on Thursday home a 'witchhunt'. Meanwhile his niece Linzi Jolin, added: 'I know my uncle is innocent.' The niece of Sir Cliff Richard, Linzi Jolin, says her uncle is innocent. Right, the singer with his 'Man Friday' Father John McElynn who is said to be supporting him through the crisis . Sir Cliff, who was in Portugal when the police raid took place and was playing tennis with friends there last night, could fly back to be interviewed under caution as early as today. They are also angry at South Yorkshire Police . officers, who have been blasted for the way the they have conducted the . case so far, reports the Sunday Mirror. Officers admitted to working with journalists before searching the £3million home. But the force has complained to the BBC and accused it of breaching its own editorial guidelines after the broadcaster found out about a search the force was planning to carry out at the home of the pop star. The singer's Berkshire penthouse was searched for five hours on Thursday by officers from South Yorkshire and Thames Valley Police as part of the investigation. Former Attorney General Dominic Grieve accused the police of having a 'collusive relationship' with the BBC. Speaking to the Sunday Telegraph, the prominent barrister said: 'I can see that police might not want to warn somebody about a search because they fear a suspect will destroy the evidence. 'But it was much odder to tip off the BBC that they were carrying out the raid. That seems quite extraordinary.' South Yorkshire Police said it was 'disappointing' that the BBC was slow to acknowledge that the force was not the source of the 'leak'. Scroll down for videos . BBC . reporter David Sillito provides news of the raid on Sir Cliff Richard's . Berkshire home on Thursday, with police vehicles in the background . It acknowledged that it did confirm to a reporter at the corporation the date of the search of Sir Cliff's house, but only because the BBC had already contacted the force to say it knew about a planned investigation. Sir Cliff, who was in Portugal when the search took place, firmly denied any wrongdoing and hit out at the fact BBC journalists were apparently tipped off about the plan. A press helicopter was reportedly at his home before police even arrived. In a statement the force reiterated that 'at no point' had it leaked information, which has been confirmed publicly by the BBC. On Friday Jonathan Munro, the BBC's head of news gathering, said there had been lots of questions about the original source of the story, tweeting: 'We won't say who, but can confirm it was not South Yorks Police.' South Yorkshire Police said: 'The force was contacted some weeks ago by a BBC reporter who made it clear he knew of the existence of an investigation. It was clear he (was) in a position to publish it. 'The force was reluctant to co-operate but felt that to do otherwise would risk losing any potential evidence, so in the interests of the investigation it was agreed that the reporter would be notified of the date of the house search in return for delaying publication of any of the facts. 'Contrary to media reports, this decision was not taken in order to maximise publicity, it was taken to preserve any potential evidence.' During the miners strike of 1984 officers from South Yorkshire attacked miners, before arresting 95 on the charge of rioting, at the Battle of Orgreave. Afterwards it was found that the force had fabricated evidence, carried out false arrests and assaulted miners. In 1991, it was forced to pay out half a million pounds to 39 miners who were arrested. Michael Mansfield QC described the evidence given by South Yorkshire Police as 'the biggest frame-up ever' and said that the force had a culture of fabricating evidence. It was for Hillsborough, in which 96 people died, that the force was condemned by Prime Minister David Cameron in September 2012 for their handling of the event, which led to an apology from the current Chief Constable David Crompton. The Hillsborough Independent Panel found the force had attempted to divert blame from their own mishandling of the tragedy by feeding false information to the media and altering statements given by their own officers. It added: 'South Yorkshire Police . considers it disappointing that the BBC was slow to acknowledge that the . force was not the source of the leak. 'A . letter of complaint has been sent to the Director General of the BBC . making it clear that the broadcaster appears to have contravened it's . editorial guidelines.' The force added that it would now welcome an investigation into the original leak. A . BBC spokeswoman said: 'A BBC journalist approached South Yorkshire . Police with information about the investigation. The BBC agreed to . follow normal journalistic practice and not to publish a story that . might jeopardise a police inquiry.'

His wife said he could still walk and understand the jokes made about him by people living in his neighbourhood, who have called him the 'half head man' or 'Frankenstein', according to the International Business Times. Now, in a surgery that was one of the first of its kind, doctors at Xijing Hospital replaced his skill with a customised 3D printed titanium mesh that was moulded in the shape of the part of his skull that had been lost. Doctors hope the surgery will not only restore the shape of Hu's skull but also may allow the brain to repair itself and grow so Hu can regain the ability to speak. The hospital brought in doctors from around the world to help come up with a solution to Hu's injuries. After deciding to implant the 3D printed titanium mesh, the surgery was performed on the 28th August and lasted for three and a half hours. The lead surgeon was Professor Shu Mao Guo, head of the department of Plastic Surgery at Xijing Hospital, and has published several papers researching advancements in medicine to restore tissues or organs. The hospital brought in doctors from around the world to help come up with a solution to Hu's injuries . Hu's wife said people living in his neighbourhood have called him the 'half headman' or 'Frankenstein' ( . Hu's scalp and meninges - the protective membranes covering the brain - were melded together after the accident. They had to be peeled apart before the titanium mesh could be implanted. The surgeons also had to separate temporal muscles at the front of the head without causing further injury. The printing materials were made specifically for Hu in Belgium, at one of the world's few specialist 3D printing facilities. They have been sponsored by Stryker, an American medical device manufacturer. Titanium mesh was chosen because it usually doesn't cause any adverse reaction- although doctors now will watch Hu to make sure the implant is not rejected by his body. Using 3D printers create customised replacement body parts is revolutionising medicine. This year, surgeons in China successfully implanted an artificial 3D-printed vertebra into a 12-year-old bone cancer patient to help him walk again. Doctors at Peking University Hospital in Beijing first removed a tumour located in the second vertebra of the boy's neck. Last month, surgeons in China successfully implanted an artificial 3D-printed vertebra (pictured) into a 12-year-old bone cancer patient to help him walk again . They then replaced it with the 3D-printed implant between the first and third vertebrae to allow him to lift his head. The five-hour surgery was a world first and will enable the boy named Minghao to walk again after spending two months confined to a hospital bed. While 3D-printed organs are not yet commonly used, there have been previous cases of patients being implanted with 3D-printed jaws, hips and even a pelvis. 'This is the first use of a 3D-printed vertebra as an implant for orthopaedic spine surgery in the world,' Dr Liu Zhongjun, who performed the surgery, told Chinese media CCTV. Using existing technology, the patient's head needs to be framed with pins after surgery. The patient's head cannot touch the bed when he is resting. This lasts for at least three months,' Dr Liu said. 'But with 3D printing technology, we can simulate the shape of the vertebra, which is much stronger and more convenient than traditional methods,' said Dr Liu Zhongjun, who performed the surgery . And last year, British surgeons used 3D printing technology to recreate the severely injured face of a road accident victim. The unaffected side of the biker’s face was used to create a mirror image, to enable perfect facial reconstruction. The images are were both to design guides to cut and position facial bones with pinpoint accuracy and create tailor-made implants for the patient.","46-year-old Hu Wei was injured after falling from the third floor of his home .

"An art student with a debilitating condition who was warned she may never pick up a paintbrush again has scored an A* grade at A-level. Doctors advised Heather Purdham to give up art after she was diagnosed with hypermobility syndrome, a condition that made it too painful for her to hold a brush in her hand. But the 17-year-old was so determined to complete her course that she taught herself to paint while holding the brush in her mouth. High achiever: Heather Purdham, 17, has been awarded an A* in A-level art after teaching herself to paint with her mouth . The resourceful teenager, of Westcliff, Essex, mastered the technique in less than a year, with extraordinary results. Heather said: 'Doctors told me to give up art last summer but I am very stubborn. 'I can’t remember a time when I didn’t enjoy drawing so I knew I just had to learn to adapt.' Heather's hopes for an A-level in art looked all but over last summer when she began to suffer excruciating pain as she gripped her paintbrush. 'I had first noticed a problem through my GCSEs when I was writing a lot more,' she said. Nice work: Heather Purdham stands with the painting which earned her an A* in art . 'I got to my AS levels last year and I couldn’t keep up any more - it was too painful and I had to stop.' Medics believed that Heather was suffering from carpal tunnel syndrome, and she underwent surgery to fix the problem. But further analysis found that her discomfort was actually caused by hypermobility syndrome - a condition which loosens joints and can make gripping items impossible. Heather, who attended Westcliff High School for Girls, could have given up, but she said she felt inspired by the successful English artist Alison Lapper, who was born without arms. Heather said: 'After the operation I was told I would not be able to do any drawing with my right hand for six months. 'I had my arm in a sling for a month so I took inspiration from disabled artist Alison Lapper and began experimenting with other techniques including painting with my other hand, my fingers, my feet and my mouth. Improvisation: Heather taught herself to produce art with her mouth after a debilitating condition made it too painful for her to grip a brush in her hand . Inspired: Heather also tried to produce pictures by holding implements between her toes . 'It was really tough at first as everything I drew came out as just ridiculous scribbles. 'But I worked on it throughout the summer and began to build a technique of dabbing the paint onto the canvas whilst holding a brush in my mouth. 'It was slow work but it seemed to get results. 'When we were given our coursework title, View Points, I set about to really challenge myself. 'I grabbed a huge canvas and got to work. It took 16 hours but I think the end result was really worth it.' Heather also received an A* in psychology, and two A grades in geography and religious studies. She now plans to study psychology at York University - but has vowed she will continue to indulge her passion for art in her spare time. Role model: Heather (right), who plans to study psychology at York University said she felt inspired by the successful English artist Alison Lapper (left), who was born without arms . She said: 'I absolutely love art so will keep it up as a hobby and hopefully I can incorporate it into my future career. 'I want to work as a paediatric psychologist so I would love to be able to use art therapy as a way of inspiring children to challenge themselves. 'Hopefully my story might even inspire them too.' Heather's parents Anne, 50, and Graham Purdham, 55, said they never doubted their daughter’s determination to complete her art course. Mrs Purdham, who teaches arts and crafts part-time, said: 'Heather has always loved art from a very early age and so we knew even a major operation wouldn’t get in her way. 'You always hope your children will do well in their exams but we were amazed when we heard Heather had achieved an A* - especially after having had less than a year to teach herself the new technique. 'She really deserves it for all the hard work she put in.'","Heather Purdham, of Westcliff, Essex, was advised to give up art after being diagnosed with debilitating condition that affected her hands .

"A pair of grandmothers have been banned from taking their mobility scooters into a town's shopping centre after they were accused of stealing a packet of kitchen rolls. Bosses at the Britannia Centre, in Hinckley, Leicestershire barred Lillian Clarke and Margaret Yates, labelling them a 'nuisance' after Mrs Clarke, 75, left a branch of Wilkinsons without paying for the paper towels.

Barred: Lilian Clarke, 75, (left) and Margaret Yates, 71, (right) have been banned from entering the Britannia Centre, in Hinckley, Leicestershire, after being branded a 'nuisance' Trouble: The ban came into place after Mrs Clarke left the centre's branch of Wilkinsons without paying for the paper towels. She returned to pay for them the following day, only to be banned on her next visit . 'I went back to pay for them the next day when I realised,' said Mrs Clarke, a widow with three children. 'But next time I went to go in with Margaret we were accused of stealing. 'I went to get two scratchcards and as I came away from the till the manager came up to me and said that I was barred. 'Then the next thing is we are barred from the whole of the Britannia Centre.' Mrs Clarke said she was told by a staff member at centre that she and Mrs Yates were 'a nuisance on their scooters'.

'We go to all the shops in there and everyone loves us. We've not done anything wrong.' Mrs Clarke admitted trying to enter the Britannia Centre - despite the ban. She said she called into the centre's Argos branch to pick up a catalogue, but was 'chased out of the centre'. She added: 'The man that chased me was like a peeping Tom - hiding around the corner and then he just chased me. I can't go anywhere at all.' Still welcome: Mrs Clarke and Mrs Yates  have refused to let the ban get them down, and are still welcomed elsewhere on the high street . The friends have refused to let the ban get them down, and are still welcomed elsewhere on the high street in their mobility scooters emblazoned with signs for their alter-egos - the Silver Lady and Scarlet Woman - and heart-shaped badges on the back, advising: 'Love is all you need.' Mrs Yates added: 'We used to spend a lot of money at the Britannia Centre. It's a good job we don't have to pick up our medication from the chemist there. 'We go to Morrisons now.' Phil Wheeler, manager at Britannia Centre, said the ban against Mrs Clarke and Mrs Yates must remain in place. Holding firm: Phil Wheeler, manager at Britannia Centre, said the ban against Mrs Clarke and Mrs Yates must remain in place . He said: 'This applies to anyone - if someone is caught shoplifting from any of the shops in the centre they will be automatically banned. 'If they try to come back into the centre when they are banned, technically they are trespassing.'

"From Helmand to Hastings, the brutality of battle can be seen in these poignant images of war kits given to British soldiers over the course of 1,000 years. Back in the 13th Century, an axe was the weapon of choice to grind down opponents. But today, soldiers have iPads as part of their equipment. The change in battle inventory has been captured in these series of images, named ‘Soldiers’ Inventories’, taken by London-based photographer Thom Atkinson. Scroll down for video . From Helmand to Hastings in 1066 (pictured), the brutality of battle can be seen in these poignant images of war kits given to British soldiers over the course of 1,000 years. These images, named 'Soldiers' Inventories', were taken by London-based photographer Thom Atkinson . The 33-year-old became fascinated by how every day army equipment could reveal intimate details about soldiers’ lives during iconic moments in history. Mr Atkinson’s images provide a story of war starting with the Battle of Hastings in 1066 and following soldiers’ equipment carried into 12 other historic conflicts. ‘One object that is quite sobering is something called a trench club,’ Mr Atkinson told MailOnline. ‘It’s basically a mace for killing people and it’s almost exactly the same in the WW1 image as the one in the medieval knight picture. It is quite shocking to realise the brutality.’ A kit for a fighting archer issued for the Battle of Agincourt in 1415. One tactic used during Agincourt was the planting of wooden stakes (bottom) to defend against cavalry . A 1485 battle kit given to a Yorkist man-at-arms during the Battle of Bosworth. Kit included long boots, a hat, a helmet that protected the face, a cloak and a gauntlet (right). The armour shows how large panels were used to stop the soldier being hurt from the sides or when facing away from their opponent . The knight picture from 1244 shows equipment used when the Christian garrison in Jerusalem came under siege. In its inventory, the knight’s weapons included a flanged mace, a crescent axe, a sword, a dagger, and an early type of polearm weapon. As well as revealing the violence of war, the kits show the essential, everyday items used by soldiers over the years such as playing cards, checkerboards and cutlery. ‘The thing that gets me is the objects that stay the same,’ said Mr Atkinson. ‘It compresses time and you realise soldiers, throughout the ages, had the same needs.’ For instance, Mr Atkinson highlights the fact that a spoon can be seen in every photograph. This . 1588 kit includes a woollen jacket with a waistcoat over the top . (top left), a petticoat that holds the trousers up (top left). Other . items include a wool bag with playing cards and dice (centre left) and pouch . A . 1645 kit used in the Battle of Naseby.  It included a sword (bottom . right), latchet shoes (top left), a red coat issued by the New Model . Army (top right) and a Matchlock Musket (bottom centre) A . 1815 private soldier kit from the Battle of Waterloo. It shows a Belgic . Shako as worn by a centre company soldier of the Coldstream Guards . (centre). The kit also includes fingerless gloves, a soldiers . red coat bearing the rank of Corporal (top right), linen shirts . and under garments . Mr Atkinson took the images with the help of historians who collect these items for historical re-enactments. ‘Britain likes fighting people so there are plenty of wars,’ he said. ‘I’ve chosen to picture the conflicts that are legendary in our history.’ He added: ‘It’s like a giant game of Tetris. You have to get everything in to the pictures to make it work visually.’ In today’s kits, the pocket watch of 1916 is replaced by a waterproof wristwatch and the basic rifle by laser-sighted guns. In earlier photos, soldiers had fewer things to carry into battle, largely due to the heavy weight of the items needed on the front line. ‘One thing that's interesting is the way has armour has evolved,’ said Mr Atkinson. ‘It begins with there being armour and suits of chainmail and then gradually, as time progresses, it gets phased out in favour of soldiers getting quicker and more manoeuvrable.’ ‘In the final photo, we go back to using armour again... in a way, it has almost gone full circle.’ A 1916 kit given to British soldier during the Battle of the Somme shows the simplicity of some of the equipment. Along with a gas mask a private would be issued with a spiked ‘trench club’. Some of the more unusual items include puttees for binding trousers around lower legs (to the right of the boots), a tin of stewed apples (top right, second row), Oxo cubes next to the tin, a leather belt with leather pouches (centre) and a trench club (centre left) A 1944 lance corporal kit from the Parachute Brigade during the Battle of Arnhem. The kit includes a parachute harness with parachute, camouflage and a battledress jacket. Other items include a a aluminium mess tin, mug, water bottle and ration kit including tin of corn beef, boiled sweets and a block of chocolate . A kit issued this year to a Royal Engineer serving in Helmland Province. It includes a camera (centre left), Osprey body armour (top), warm weather hat, spare clothing and a shemagh - to soak up sweat (top right). Rations are included with 24 hours worth of food (centre).

"Investigators in Saratoga Springs, Utah, broke their silence over what prompted officers to shoot and kill 22-year-old Darrien Hunt outside a fast food restaurant on Wednesday, saying he lunged at them with a sword. 'When the officers made contact with Mr. Hunt, he brandished the sword and lunged toward the officers with the sword, at which time Mr. Hunt was shot,' according to a prepared statement from Utah County Chief Deputy Attorney Tim Taylor. But an attorney for the man's family questioned that scenario, contending that an autopsy shows Hunt was shot numerous times from behind as he ran away from police, KSL reported. This photo of Darrien Nathaniel Hunt being confronted by two officers was taken minutes before they shot and killed him . Saratoga Springs police had been responding to reports of a 'suspicious' man and carrying a 'Samurai-type sword'. The police statement came a day after Hunt's mother said her son was shot because he was black. 'There is currently no indication that race played any role in the confrontation between Mr. Hunt and the police officers,' the statement said. But Susan Hunt said she thinks he wouldn't have been shot were her son white. . 'I'm in Saratoga Springs, cause it's a safe little community and they killed him,' Susan Hunt said on Friday. 'They killed my son because he's black. No white boy with a little sword would they shoot while he's running away.' Susan Hunt said she thinks her 22-year-old son Darrien would never have been shot were he white like her . Susan Hunt, middle, said Darrien had been going through some tough times emotionally since she left an abusive relationship three years ago . 'Would they have done that to any white boy?' she added. Police say they shot Darrien Nathaniel Hunt, whose father is black and mother is white, on Wednesday while he was carrying what they have described as a Samurai sword. 'Those stupid cops thought they had to murder over a toy,' Ms Hunt said. 'This is my baby. This is my family. And they ruined my family.' Officers stand at the scene of the shooting in Saratoga Springs. Police deny Hunt's race had anything to do with the shooting but have declined to provide more details about what prompted officers to shoot him . Friends and family of Hunt's have been leaving flowers, pictures and other objects at a makeshift memorial near where he was killed . 'We sympathize with Mr Hunt’s family during this difficult time. Any claim that our officers’ actions were a result of Mr Hunt’s race are completely unfounded and speculative. Our officers responded to a call for service and addressed the situation that was presented to them. The Utah County Attorney’s Office continues to investigate the incident,' according to a statement from the city. Differing accounts from several eyewitnesses have confounded the confusion over what actually happened. Police say Hunt was carrying a Samurai sword but didn't reveal any other details about what prompted officers to shoot him . Most agree he had a three-foot sword, either in his hand or strapped to his back, but some described him as 'distressed', while others said he was 'totally calm', according to media reports. Hunt was walking near a cluster of shops, including a Panda Express, a gas station and a credit union. One of the witnesses  sent Ms Hunt a photo of police confronting her son outside the bank just before shots were fired. The pictures shows two officers standing on either side of Darrien Hunt, with no sword visible. At that point a shot was fired, according to the Hunt family's limited information, and more rang out as Mr Hunt ran toward the Panda Express, and the young man was struck and killed. 'I've been begging the police, why from the time I saw the pictures of you just standing by him with his hands to his side, does he end up seconds later with a bullet in him?' Ms Hunt said. 'And then if he's running, why you had to put in more bullets, and I don't even know how many? That's what I want to know. Would they have done that to any white boy?' Hunt reportedly ran toward this Panda Express during the confrontation with officers, when he was killed. The memorial was set up on the right side . Ms Hunt said her son was a tender young man who cared about the world and was emotionally confused after her family fled an abusive relationship. The letter at right was affixed to the small memorial at the scene of the incident . She described the sword as a Katana blade purchased at an Asian souvenir shop in the area and unable to cut anything. Ms Hunt said her son loved everyone and was deeply concerned about the environment and problems plaguing other parts of the world.. A boy in a man's body, Mr Hunt was still coming to terms with life after their family fled an abusive relationship three years ago, she said. He was born in Salt Lake City, and the family later moved to Kentucky and Virginia before returning to Utah. 'My son is a tender heart who would not hurt anybody. Just wanted to be loved. And he was so confused. He was abused his whole life,' she said. 'My son is a beautiful, bright-eyed, intelligent boy.' In January, Hunt took a plea in abeyance to a misdemeanor charge of assault, according to state court records, according to KSL.com. Ms Hunt said he should never have been charged with the incident because he was drunk and venting and only lightly pushed her. He also punched other teenagers in the house who were trying to control him. A growing makeshift memorial sprung up in front of the Panda Express on Friday, with balloons, flowers and pictures of Darrien. The Hunt family has set up a fund to help pay for funeral expenses. Donations can be made at any America First Credit Union under Darrien Hunt's name.","Hunt family attorney said the autopsy shows Darrien Hunt was shot many times from behind as he ran away from police .

"Alejandro Sabella has emerged as a shock contender to become the new manager at Leeds. Sabella, who quit as Argentina manager following their defeat by Germany in this summer’s World Cup Final, is on Elland Road owner Massimo Cellino’s wishlist after caretaker Neil Redfearn was ruled out of the running to replace the sacked Dave Hockaday. Sabella, 59, is considering a return to Elland Road 33 years after ending a nightmare 19-month spell with them as a player. Alejandro Sabella led Argentina to the World Cup final before suffering a 1-0 defeat to Germany at Brazil 2014 . He made just 23 appearances for Leeds after joining as a £400,000 signing from Sheffield United in 1980 before being sold on to Estudiantes. Argentina media spoke to Sabella last night and he said: 'The Leeds situation is intriguing, and I feel I have unfinished business with that club.' Cellino initially said he would prefer a British coach and former Liverpool striker Robbie Fowler is among those to have expressed an interest, however, persuading Sabella would represent a major coup for the club. Leeds are monitoring Sabella who has experience of working with stars including Lionel Messi . Sabella claims he has unfinished business at Elland Road following a 19-month playing spell in the early 1980s where he failed to sparkle following a £400,000 move from Sheffield United . Speaking to the Yorkshire Evening Post, Cellino said: 'Neil Redfearn`s very busy with the academy and I need him in that job. 'He`s an outstanding coach, a guy who knows how good teams should play, but it would do too much damage to the academy if he stays as (head) coach. 'He`ll be coach at Bournemouth, 100 per cent, and maybe on Saturday as well. But I`ve got ideas about what I`ll do. I`m thinking about a foreign coach, an international coach who I can work with. We need to meet and talk but I think he could be good for us.'","Alejandro Sabella resigned as Argentina boss after World Cup final defeat .

'Feels great to influence such a young generation and I hope he's living a happy and healthy life.' The picture has now been shared almost 5,500 times. Brandon said today his favourite sport is gymnastics and he hopes to one day win a gold medal at the Olympics. He said he enjoys working out as it 'makes him feel happy'. He said: 'I want to be able to do all the things which Frank (Medrano) can do and I also want to be really strong as well.' Proud father Mark, 32, a former semi-pro footballer, said: 'Frank Medrano spotted him on Instagram and took a screengrab and put it on Facebook. Brandon's father, a semi-professional footballer, says his son's love of fitness inspired him to lose weight . Brandon's father says the boy was thrilled when the bodybuilder posted his picture online . Brandon, who weighs 25kg, pictured with his father Mark, mother Corinne and his sister Sienna . 'It went viral and people were talking about Brandon in Hong Kong and Australia. It was crazy. 'Brandon was just delighted he was noticed by his hero. Not that he needed it, but it's motivated him even more. 'He's a very active little boy and he doesn't do any weights. He is into gymnastics and that is where his physique comes from. 'He's developed it over the past year - it is crazy looking at him. Brandon is happy and healthy and his core strength is amazing, he is an inspiration. 'I put on a lot of weight and Brandon actually motivated me to lose it. He has been my son and my mentor. Brandon is a fan of calisthenics - exercise which doesn't need any equipment. The type of exercise consists of a variety of rhythmical movements - such as jumping swinging, twisting or kicking - completed without any apparatus. The exercise increases body strength and flexibility as well as muscular and cardiovascular fitness. Frequent users also note improved balance, coordination and agility. Military units and sports teams are known to use the technique to help team work and group discipline. 'But he is just an ordinary little boy who loves playing with his friends. There is a small element of people who are saying it is bad, but it is not - I think it sends a positive message.' Brandon has a healthy diet consisting of cereal in the morning, fruit throughout the day and meat and two veg of an evening. He is not really into sweets - but will normally have some on a Friday as a treat. He achieved his shape through calisthenics - or exercise which doesn't need any equipment. His father added: 'Brandon is very well behaved for an eight-year-old. He's energetic, but respectful. He likes to look after his little sister Sienna, who is two. 'He is a very determined little boy. I'll come home and see he's on a chin-up bar saying he has just done 50. 'When he brings his friends around I almost trip over them as they're all doing press-ups. We have to encourage him to of and play on his Xbox.' Andy Myers, a friend of Mark's and a personal trainer who runs AM Fitness in Kildare, often advises the boy on fitness. He said: 'Some people will jump to a conclusion about Brandon and they will be wrong. I'm not hands on with him. It is all about living well, eating well, sleeping well and being free from stress. 'Some parents push their kids to play football, but Mark has let Brandon do his own thing. 'There is nothing excessive about what Brandon does and hopefully he will inspire others. It is completely natural and great that he has taken to it. It is to be celebrated.'","Brandon Blake became online sensation when fitness star posted picture .

"Nasa's effort to identify potentially dangerous space rocks has taken a hit. The space agency's inspector general has released a report blasting Nasa's Near Earth Objects program, which is meant to hunt and catalog comets, asteroids and relatively large fragments of these objects that pass within 28 million miles of Earth. Just one million of the program's $40 million annual budget is spent on strategies to deflect an incoming asteroid or evacuate areas in danger of impact, said the report by Nasa inspector General Paul Martin. Scroll down for video . In a 44-page report, Inspector General Paul Martin said the Near Earth Objects program needs to be better organized and managed, with a bigger staff. For nearly a decade, the report noted, NASA has been tracking near-Earth objects bigger than 460 feet across. The goal was to catalog 90 percent by 2020. The space agency has discovered and plotted the orbits of more than 11,000 near-Earth objects since 1998, an estimated 10 percent. It does not expect to meet the 2020 deadline. The purpose is to protect the planet against their potential dangers. Most near-Earth objects harmlessly disintegrate before reaching Earth's surface. But there are exceptions, like the nearly 60-foot meteor that exploded over Russia in 2013, causing considerable damage. In a 44-page report, Inspector General Paul Martin said the Near Earth Objects program needs to be better organized and managed, with a bigger staff. 'We believe the program would be more efficient, effective and transparent were it organized and managed in accordance with standard NASA research program requirements,' it said. The report faulted the NEO Program's lack of structure, and said its resources are inadequate for handling its growing agenda. It said the program's executive office fell short when it came to overseeing progress in the asteroid-tracking effort. There were no formal partnerships with the Defense Department or the National Science Foundation, or with international space agencies, it pointed out. Those groups could make significant contributions to the effort, the report said. The 'lack of planning and resources has prevented the NEO Program from developing additional agreements that could help achieve program goals,' it added. 'For example, establishing formal partnerships with the Department of Defense, the National Science Foundation, and international agencies could give the NEO Program access to additional Earth-based telescopes and thereby increase its ability to detect, track, and characterize a greater number of NEOs. The space agency has discovered and plotted the orbits of more than 11,000 near-Earth objects since 1998, an estimated 10 percent . NASA's science mission chief, former astronaut John Grunsfeld, agreed and promised the problems will be fixed.

The space agency has discovered and plotted the orbits of more than 11,000 near-Earth objects since 1998, an estimated 10 percent. It does not expect to meet the 2020 deadline. The program has insufficient oversight, Martin's office concluded, and no established milestones to track progress. In addition, NASA needs to do a better job of overseeing the various observatories searching for near-Earth objects, and teaming up with other U.S. and international agencies, the report said.

"Newcastle legend Alan Shearer fears his former side could be relegated as they don't look like scoring or keeping clean sheets. Alan Pardew's men remain rooted to the bottom of the Premier League after picking up just two points from their opening four games, with many Toon fans calling for the manager's head during the 4-0 defeat at Southampton. And Shearer doesn't see things changing drastically and says the pressure is really on Newcastle now. Alan Shearer has major concerns over his former side Newcastle this season . Newcastle are lacking the killer instinct they had when Shearer was up front . In his column for The Sun he said: 'Newcastle do not look like scoring and do not look like keeping clean sheets. 'That's a recipe for relegation in anyone's book - and boss Alan Pardew is now under massive pressure. 'The display against Southampton was just terrible from start to finish.' While Toon owner Mike Ashley has given Pardew a vote of confidence following Saturday's 4-0 defeat at Southampton, time is seemingly running out for the 53-year-old, with Shearer stressing that the pressure will continue to build until Newcastle finally turn the corner. He added: 'Newcastle just simply have to win now. The longer you go without a win, the harder it is to get one. The pressure is well and truly on.'

"It was a second set visit for the Queen in two days after she met Antiques Roadshow experts, 24 hours after touring the Game of Thrones set in Belfast. While she refused to take a seat on the HBO drama's infamous Iron Throne, today the Queen was all smiles, eagerly picking up a minature bronze horse taken from the Royal Collection. She even confessed to watching the show, with the Duke of Edinburgh quizzing producers and presenter Fiona Bruce about when the episode starring them would air. Scroll down for video . That's more like it! The Queen inspects a bronze sculpture of 1863 Derby winner, a horse named Macaroni . The Queen turned from signing the visitors' book to add: 'If it is in . August then even better because we might have a chance to see it.' Among the pieces to find favour with the monarch was a small, bronze sculpture of a horse and jockey, believed to be of the 1863 Derby winner Macaroni. The history of the work by French artist Pierre Jules Mene, and the race, stirred interest after the experts revealed the Epsom winner took home the spoils after 32 false starts. 'It seems very incompetent doesn’t it,' commented the Queen, a racehorse owner who has had runners in the Derby herself. 'But quite interesting.' Just the thing! The Queen appeared more enamoured with the Antiques Roadshow than Game of Thrones . Gracious guest: The Queen took time to sign the visitor's book at Hillsborough Castle . Leaving his mark: Prince Philip was also keen to leave his signature in the guest book . Enjoying herself: The Queen appeared particularly enamoured with the bronze of Macaroni . With its . gentle experts and enthusiasm for all things historical, Antiques . Roadshow is far more in keeping with the Queen's personal taste than Game . of Thrones, although Buckingham Palace refused to confirm which of the . shows Her Majesty watches. The HBO . drama, which emerged from a set of fantasy novels by George R. R Martin, . is thought to be loosely based on the Wars of the Roses, which saw two . opposing dynasties battle it out for the throne of England. With York on one side and Lancaster on . the other, England was convulsed by a series of battles, dastardly plots . and pretenders lurking on the other side of the Channel until, with the . death of Richard III, Lancaster finally triumphed. Although the Queen is a descendant of the House of Lancaster - and is the current holder of both title and duchy - she appeared far more engaged when discussing antiques with the BBC One experts. Along with Macaroni's bronze, the royal couple were also shown a George IV library table, which is one of a pair kept at Hillsborough, an 18th century Chinese soup tureen and five figurines from a Meissen monkey orchestra - both of which are held in the National Museum of Northern Ireland. One of the more interesting pieces was a Wagga Wagga stick which was gifted to the Queen on her tour of Australia in 1954, although there was no explanation for how the Aboriginal fighting club ended up in Hillsborough. Greeting: The Queen was also introduced to Antiques Roadshow's presenter, Fiona Bruce . Interesting: The Queen with Antiques Roadshow experts Hilary Kay, Paul Atterbury and John Axford . Prince . Philip was particularly interested in the club but couldn't resist a . joke questioning the evidence linking the item to the royal collection. 'Where’s the evidence?' he quipped. 'The . story between then and now is mysterious,' riposted Antiques Roadshow's bric-à-brac expert, Paul Atterbury. 'I think that’s like a lot of . things that arrive here in the palace without any clear knowledge of how . or why. All the things here (on the table) are in the house for one . reason or another without the back story.' Take your fancy? The Queen was particularly keen on a silver christening cup that has a strong connection to the Royal Family . Mr Atterbury and fellow experts John Axford, a ceramics and Far East specialist, and Hilary Kay introduced the items and spent 10 minutes with the royals. Among the items shown by Ms Kay to the Queen was a christening cup that has a strong connection to the royal family. 'What was lovely about this is, this is a piece unlike the other objects as it has a direct family connection,' she said. 'She . loved the silver and she was very interested in the stories behind the . items - they were both interested in everything on the table.' One is not sitting there! The Queen chose to give the Iron Throne a wide berth during a visit to the HBO set . Nice to meet you: The Queen met Game of Thrones cast, among them Kit Harrington and Lena Headey . The . cup was gifted to the daughter of the chief engineer on a transatlantic . liner after she was born while Lord Granville, Governor of Northern . Ireland, and his wife, were travelling on the ship to America. On hearing the news Lady Granville, the Queen’s aunt, said she would send a gift for the new arrival, Rose. The . Queen was told how the young woman gifted the silver cup back to the . royal family, along with two . family photographs, to add to their collections. Afterwards, the Queen was flown by helicopter from Hillsborough to Coleraine in County Londonderry, where they are guests of honour at an event marking the work of the British Legion. The Queen ended her three day trip on a somber note as she lay a wreath as tribute to the Irish servicemen who died in the First World War. Her Majesty and Prince Phillip were guests of honour at the commemorative event in Coleraine to mark the centenary of the outbreak of conflict and those who lost their lives in the four years that followed. Servicemen from all over Ireland fought in the First World War, which ended three years before the island was partitioned. The Queen and Prince Philip laid a wreath as tribute to the fallen soldiers of Ireland in WW1 . Members of the Royal British Legion from both sides of the Irish border joined the Queen and Philip at the civic reception in the Town Hall. Despite a heavy downpour, the Queen and Philip were met by hundreds of well-wishers, hoping to steal a glimpse of the royal couple. There was a somber mood at Coleraine as the royal couple and well-wishers stood for a minutes silence . There was a nostalgic feel to the afternoon as re-enactors dressed in period costume for the memorial . The streets of Coleraine were . bursting with crowds waving Union Jacks and local shopkeepers and office . workers took a break to watch from the windows of their businesses. The . town created a nostalgic feel to the day with re-enactors dressed in . period costume and, after the solemnity of the wreath laying and . minute's silence, the Queen embarked on a walkabout to say greet some of . her adoring fans. The Queen wore a mournful expression at today's memorial . Despite a downpour of rain, hundreds of well-wishers came to catch a glimpse of the Queen and Philip .

"The BBC handed out £26million in severance payoffs over the past 12 months, it admitted yesterday. A year after it promised to get a grip on the spiralling costs of ‘golden goodbyes’, the corporation is still paying out huge sums to hundreds of departing staff. The BBC refused to name the recipients, but in total, 12 of the BBC’s managers . received payments totalling £2.8million – an average of more than . £230,000 each – despite new director general Tony Hall, pictured, . pledging in April 2013 to cap deals at £150,000. Former BBC1 controller Peter Fincham (left) walked away in 2007 with £500,000 after resigning over the so-called Crowngate scandal and George Entwistle took £470,000 when he resigned as director-general . Tory . MP Stewart Jackson, who sits on the Commons public accounts committee . which investigated the original payoff scandal, said the BBC ‘does not . seem to have learned its lessons’. The . figures, published in the BBC’s annual report, reveal a total of . £25.6million was given to 413 staff from April last year until the end . of March. This included £3.6million handed to just 22 senior managers. The . report comes a year after the National Audit Office found the BBC paid . departing staff £369million over eight years, including £61million to . 401 senior managers. Last . financial year’s payoff total was a significant fall on 2012/13, when . £40million was handed to 793 staff, with senior managers receiving . £5million. In an internal . review published alongside the report, Dame Fiona Reynolds, a BBC . non-executive director, said ‘more needs to be done’ to clamp down. The BBC said the 12 payoffs of more than £150,000 had been ‘in the pipeline’ before the cap came into effect in September. A . spokesman added: ‘Severance payments have declined since Tony Hall . introduced a cap ... but like any organisation when long-standing . members of staff are made redundant they are contractually entitled to . payments. The cap means no longer can anyone receive more than . £150,000.’ Cutting costs: The BBC  revealed that it has slashed £6million from the amount paid to its top stars. Susanna Reid (pictured second from left with her Good Morning Britain co-presenters) left the BBC for ITV in April, where she reportedly receives a £400,000 a year salary . Big earners: The BBC has been criticised for the amount it spends on stars such as Jeremy Clarkson and Graham Norton, but today announced its talent bill has been cut from £200m to £194m in the past year . As the report was published yesterday, the BBC . Trust, the corporation's governing body, said there had been successes, . highlighting shows like Call The Midwife and Rev, but acting chairman . Diane Coyle added: 'There have also been some high-profile failures. 'The . BBC’s Digital Media Initiative project was closed at a cost of nearly . £100 million. And there was the controversy surrounding past severance . payments... 'Both . of these episodes involved significant sums of public money and saw the . BBC falling well short of what licence fee-payers expect.' Excessive . payouts came under scrutiny last year when it emerged that deputy . director-general Mark Byford left the BBC with a total payout of . £949,000 and former chief operating officer Caroline Thomson was given . £680,000. George . Entwistle took £470,000 when he resigned as director-general in the . wake of the Jimmy Savile scandal after being in the role for just 54 . days, with 150 managers between them receiving £25 million in pay-offs. The . Commons Public Accounts Committee was critical of the payments in a . report late last year, with the chairman saying the BBC had 'put its . reputation at risk'. The report also showed the amount paid to the broadcaster’s top stars was slashed by more than £6 million last year. The corporation had been heavily criticised for the amount it pays its top talent, with presenters including Jeremy Clarkson and Graham Norton reportedly among its biggest earners. In its annual report for 2013/14, the BBC said talent pay was slashed by more than £6 million, bringing a 15 per cent fall in its talent bill since 2009. The number of senior managers was cut by 8 per cent last year, while the number of top earners on salaries of more than £100,000 fell for the fourth consecutive year. High salary: Departures, such as that of former Newsnight presenter Jeremy Paxman who left his post in June will help trim the wage bill in this financial year . Further high profile departures, such as that of former Newsnight presenter Jeremy Paxman - thought to have been on a salary of more than £500,000 a year - who left his post in June will help trim the wage bill in this financial year. In addition to the falling talent bill, Lord Hall is set to announce that the BBC is 'delivering on its commitments', with popular shows such as Sherlock and Happy Valley, despite a 26 per cent reduction in funds available for BBC services over six years. Among the 150 BBC executives thought to have received huge pay-offs from the corporation is Peter Fincham. The former BBC1 controller who walked away in 2007 with £500,000 after resigning over the so-called Crowngate scandal. Mr Fincham, who is now ITV director of TV, wrongly told the Press at a screening that the Queen walked out of a photoshoot featured in a royal documentary ‘in a huff’. It later emerged that a promotional trailer for the programme had been misleadingly edited and that his account was untrue. Mark Byford, the former deputy director general of the BBC, received a controversial pay-off package that saw him leave the BBC in 2011 with £949,000. George Entwistle took £470,000 when he resigned as director-general in the wake of the Jimmy Savile scandal after being in the role for just 54 days. Senior BBC managers received a total of £25milion in severance deals between 2009 and 2012, and nearly £3million was paid over and above what they were entitled to in their contracts in the six years to 2012, a National Audit Office report found. It follows a licence fee freeze and new commitments given to the BBC such as part-funding the roll-out of superfast broadband, the corporation will say. Lord Hall will also pledge a 4 per cent increase in spending on content and delivery over the next three years. The BBC said it is 'delivering on its commitments', with popular shows such as Sherlock and Happy Valley, despite an effective 26 per cent reduction in funds available for BBC services over six years following a licence fee freeze and new commitments given to the BBC such as part-funding the superfast broadband roll-out. BBC director-general Tony Hall is also pledging a 4 per cent increase in spending on content and delivery over the next three years. Last week BBC News announced plans to axe 415 posts to save £48 million a year by 2016/17. The cuts will be offset by around 195 new roles, meaning a net reduction of 220 jobs. The BBC annual report shows that a total £3.62 million was made in severance payments to 22 senior management staff in 2013/14. That was down on the £5.06 million for 2012/13. Severance payments to all staff, including senior managers, was £25.6 million in 2013/14 compared with £40.2 million in 2012/13. The report also showed that 'audience appreciation' has decreased for BBC1, BBC2, BBC3 and BBC4. Ms Coyle said that the BBC had 'found its feet' after a 'bruising period'. She added: 'The BBC executive has made good progress on its priorities for the past 12 months, and we are expecting further progress in the next year on areas including... the variety and originality of programmes, value for money and serving an increasingly diverse UK.' Spending: Tony Hall, the BBC director-general, pledged to increase spending on content and delivery . Popular: Lord Hall is set to announce that the BBC is 'delivering on its commitments', with popular shows such as Sherlock, despite a 26 per cent reduction in funds available for BBC services over six years . Audience appreciation of BBC television has fallen slightly for the first time in a number of years, to 82.1 per cent. The BBC defended the fall at a press conference, saying that it was because it had done so well the previous year with the London Olympics, the European Championship and the Diamond Jubilee. Danny Cohen, director of television, added: 'There's no doubt if you take 26 per cent of your spending out, you are going to have an impact on how people feel about things. 'But I feel very, very confident in the quality of what we are doing, in its distinctiveness, and I feel very confident that the overall appreciation of our channels will grow.' Among the stars to leave the corporation in the last year was BBC Breakfast presenter Susanna Reid, who left to join ITV's Good Morning Britain. Reid, who became a household name when she reached the final of last year's Strictly Come Dancing, left the BBC in April for an opportunity she 'couldn't turn down', which reportedly netted her a £400,000 a year salary. Earlier this month the BBC Trust ordered a review into how the corporation pays its stars but said it will not publish details of 'individual talent deals'. A planned strike by BBC staff scheduled for the first day of the Commonwealth Games on Wednesday was called off last week. The BBC has announced plans to axe 415 posts to save £48 million a year by 2016/17.

"Hours before Robert Xie allegedly murdered five members of the Lin family he shared a dinner with three of them, a court has heard. Lian Bin 'Robert' Xie, 50, is accused of murdering his brother-in-law Min 'Norman' Lin, 45, Mr Lin's wife, Yun 'Lily' Li Lin, 44 and their sons Henry, 12, and Terry, 9 in the early hours of July 18, 2009 in their home in Sydney's northwest.

He is also alleged to have killed Lily's sister, Yun Bin 'Irene' Yin, 39. Xie, who has pleaded not guilty, is facing a retrial after his trial earlier this year was cut short. In opening the crown case for a second time at the Supreme Court on Tuesday, prosecutor Mark Tedeschi QC said Xie was 'motivated by intense bitterness and hatred' when he went to their North Epping home and turned off the electricity. Walking around silently, it is alleged he went into Min and Lily's bedroom first and murdered them in their beds. He then killed the third adult, Irene. All three adults had 'very substantial deformation of their faces', with the assault upon them occurring while they were asleep or just waking up, Mr Tedeschi told the jury. Having killed those that represented the largest 'threat', the crown says Xie then went into the bedroom the two boys Henry and Terry shared. Here a struggle did break out. 'The boys were not in their beds ... from the way the room was found there had been a furious struggle,' Mr Tedeschi said. Mr Tedeschi the evidence would establish that there was 'one primary weapon used to subdue and cause the most horrendous injuries to the five victims'. Scroll down for video .

"A police officer broke down at the murder trial of Robert Xie, pictured, on Wednesday reliving the day he discovered the slain bodies of the Lin Family . A police officer has fought back tears in court as he relived the moment he discovered the battered and bloodied bodies of two children and their parents and one of their aunts, at the Lin family home in Sydney. Sergeant Lachlan Kirby had to take a break at the NSW Supreme Court on Wednesday as he gave evidence at the trial of accused murderer Lian Bin 'Robert' Xie. Xie is accused of creeping into his brother-in-law's home in North Epping in Sydney's northwest in the early hours of July 18, 2009. Using a hammer-like weapon, he allegedly murdered his brother-in-law Min 'Norman' Lin, 45, Mr Lin's wife, Yun 'Lily' Li Lin, 44, and their sons Henry, 12, and Terry, nine. He is also alleged to have killed Lily's sister, Yun Bin 'Irene' Lin, 39. Xie has pleaded not guilty. Sgt Kirby was a senior constable when he was one of the first two police officers to enter the bloody scene. As he went up the stairs of the family home, he was followed by Senior Constable Robert Levins. Once on the second floor the two separated and went to explore the bedrooms separately. When Snr Const Levins nudged open the door to the master bedroom with his foot he saw blood on the walls and Lily's battered head hanging over the side of the bed. Yun Bin 'Irene' Yin (left) was staying with her sister Lily (right) and Lily's husband Min when they and Irene's nephews Terry, 9, and Henry, 12, were bludgeoned to death with a hammer-like object . 'We've a dead one in there,' he called to Sgt Kirby. 'Same in here,' Sgt Kirby replied from Irene's room. Sgt Kirby told Snr Const Levins to go downstairs and check on Xie's wife Kathy who was distressed while he continued looking in the bedrooms. It was then he discovered the bodies of the two young boys.

"Nick Clegg today admitted that a government crackdown on vile websites will not be enough to protect children from web filth. The Deputy Prime Minister said parents had to police what youngsters were viewing online. And he called for very young children to be taught about the dangers that lurk on the internet to ‘make the child responsible’. Warning: Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg, pictured today, said parents had to keep a close watch on what children viewed online . David Cameron has spearheaded a government crackdown on 'poisonous' websites which he says are 'corroding childhood'. In a major speech last week he announced every householder connected to the internet will have their access to online porn blocked unless they ask to receive it. Pornography depicting rape will be outlawed. But Mr Clegg said pop-up warnings would not be enough and parents had to tightly control what their family views on the internet. Speaking on his weekly radio phone-in he said: ‘At the end of the day we are giving our children unparalleled opportunities to access more information than any previous generation's ever had access to. ‘And I don't think there's a simple . push-of-a-button solution. Yes you need to use technology but you also . need at a much earlier age than any of us were used to, to actually . educate kids to kind of take quite mature decisions for themselves. Dangers: The Prime Minister said he was worried about his children's access to the internet, including using his iPad . ‘That's a tricky thing to do,’ he told LBC 97.3. Mr Clegg is the latest senior politician to voice fears about what his children are viewing online. Labour leader Ed Miliband has said that ‘like any parent’ he was concerned about how easy it is for sons Daniel, four, and 2-year-old Sam to see violent adult images on mobile phones or computers. And earlier this week Mr Cameron revealed he will allow his children to have Facebook accounts – but only if he can monitor what they post. The Prime Minister said he was worried that holiday snaps uploaded to social networking sites could stop his three children from securing jobs in future. He also revealed he has started talking to his nine-year-old daughter Nancy about the pressures put on young girls by images of women in the media. Mr Clegg said his three sons, aged 11, nine and four, do not yet have Facebook pages and said the company's lower age limit of 13 for membership ‘feels about right’. The Deputy Prime Minister said his children - particularly eldest son Antonio - ‘spend a lot of time... taking my wife's iPad and playing around on it’. He added: ‘I'm forever kind of sort of peering over his shoulder, making sure that, like any anxious parent, he doesn't stumble on stuff that you don't want your child to see... ‘I can see it with him and his friends and his peer group. They are all incredibly tech-savvy already, particularly on tablets. They spend a lot of time telling each other ""Look at this clip, look at that clip"" on YouTube. So they're forever dipping in and out.’ Mr Clegg explained how he had tried to ensure his son used the internet safely: ‘Of course I've had to sit down with my 11-year-old and say, `There's stuff that you can get to see on this machine which I don't want you to see and which you want to'. You have to try and make the child responsible.’","Deputy Prime Minister reveals fears for what sons view on internet .

"Sony CEO Howard Stringer is to step down after six years, the company revealed today. Sony is struggling to maintain its standing due in part to its TV division's battle to keep up with Samsung . Welsh-born Sony CEO and President Sir Howard Stringer is to step down after six years, the company said today. Sony said on Wednesday that Vice President Kazuo Hirai will take over the roles of CEO and president on April 1. Hirai is currently president of Sony's consumer electronics division, and is best-known for the launches of the company's successful PlayStation and PlayStation 2 consoles. Stringer will retain the chairman’s post. The company is now struggling to regain its standing in the consumer electronics sector in which it was once a driving force. Sony has been losing money in its television division as it loses ground to South Korean rival Samsung. Sony signalled last March that Hirai would be Stringer’s successor by promoting him to head consumer products and services, which makes up the bulk of Sony’s $85 billion in annual sales. Early last month, Japanese media reported that Hirai was due to take the president’s post as early as April. Sony has forecast a fourth year in a row of net losses for the year ending on March 31. Analysts gave a consensus forecast of 8.8 billion yen ($115.41 million) in operating profit for the fourth quarter of last year and 8.2 billion yen for the full financial year to March. Stringer's successor Kaz Hirai is currently president of Sony's consumer electronics division, and is best-known for the launches of the company's successful PlayStation and PlayStation 2 consoles.

"The Nebraska doctors treating an American aid worker infected with Ebola said today he has responded well to aggressive treatment in the past week. Dr Rick Sacra received blood transfusions from Ebola survivor Dr Kent Brantly shortly after he arrived at the Nebraska Medical Center last Friday, Dr Phil Smith said on Thursday. The 51-year-old Sacra, who had been working at a hospital in Liberia, also received an experimental drug that doctors refuse to identify. And he has received supportive care including IV fluids. Debbie Sacra, wife of Dr Rick Sacra, reads Bible verses to him (on screen) during a video conference at the Nebraska Medical Center in Omaha on Wednesday. His condition improving after he contracted Ebola . Dr Rick Sacra (left) received blood transfusions from Ebola survivor Dr Kent Brantly (right) shortly after he arrived at the Nebraska Medical Center last Friday . Smith says doctors wanted to treat Sacra with everything available to give him the best chance of recovering. The doctors treating Sacra are talking with doctors at Emory University Hospital who have treated three other Ebola patients. They hope to develop to develop new treatment plans based on the experience. Dr Sacra's wife Debbie spoke of her deep gratitude to Dr Brantly for donating his blood to help her husband. Mrs Sacra said that she and Dr Brantly's wife Amber had marveled that both their sick husband's shared a blood type. She said: 'It really meant a lot to us that he was willing to give that donation so soon after his own recovery.' Dr Sacra, who is being treated in a special biocontainment unit at the University of Nebraska Medical Center in Omaha, received two doses of plasma from Brantly, which doctors are calling a convalescent serum. 'I don't know how much of his recovery is due to the drug, how much is due to the convalescent serum and how much to the aggressive intravenous fluids,' Dr Smith said. Brantly's blood likely contains protective antibodies that may help buy Sacra some time while his body tries to fight off the infection, Smith said. A worker in a Personal Protection Equipment suit (PPE) uses a stick to move garbage inside the high-risk quarantined zone of the John Fitzgerald Kennedy hospital in the Liberian capital Monrovia. The fourth American who contracted the disease in West Africa is said to be improving . The hospital tried a number of potential donors, but Brantly's blood type turned out to be a match for his friend and fellow missionary Sacra. The worst-ever Ebola outbreak, which has already killed at least 2,296 people in West Africa, has triggered a scramble to develop the first drug or vaccine for a deadly disease that was discovered nearly 40 years ago in the forests of central Africa. Smith said he has been asked not to disclose the name of the experimental drug Sacra is receiving because it is still in the early stages of development and there is no data on whether it works. Sacra arrived at the Nebraska hospital from Liberia on Friday, September 5, and has since shown a 'remarkable improvement,' Dr. Angela Hewlett told the briefing. Smith said Sacra's first day was 'pretty rocky' but he began improving by the third day of care. His wife, Debbie, said she is 'amazed' at how quickly Sacra has 'turned around since he arrived.' She said Sacra contracted Ebola on August 29 while working at a hospital in Liberia on behalf of the North Carolina-based Christian group SIM USA. Sacra had worked in the obstetrics ward at the ELWA Hospital of SIM in Monrovia.","Dr Rick Sacra received blood transfusions from Ebola survivor Dr Kent Brantly shortly after he arrived at the Nebraska Medical Center last Friday .

"The cost of a hospital delivery in America has tripled since 1996, averaging out at $9,775 for a vaginal delivery - the highest cost of any country in the world, according to a new analysis. A report by Truven Health Analytics for the New York Times found that the average total price for pregnancy as well as newborn care is about $30,000 for vaginal delivery, and $50,000 for a C-section, with insurers paying out an average of $18,329 and $27,866 respectively. What's more, America is uniquely expensive when it comes to childbirth; in other developed countries, delivery is often cheap or even free, and post-birth care is significantly more extensive. The price of pregnancy: The cost of giving birth in a hospital in America has tripled since 1996, averaging at $9,775 - the highest cost of any industrialized country in the world . Even insured women in the U.S. pay out-of-pocket costs of $3,400 on average, compared to little or nothing 20 years ago. The difference in the cost of pregnancy and delivery between the U.S. and other industrialized countries is staggering. In America, the average cost of a C-section delivery is $15,041, compared to $6,441 in France and just $4,435 in the United Kingdom. And while pregnancy and childbirth is less expensive in other countries, that's not to say it is any less comprehensive. Indeed, in Ireland, where women receive the same amount of high-tech maternity care as Americans, delivery is free at public hospitals. Women here can also opt to pay a fee for private deliveries. In the U.S., insurance is supposed to cover childbirth, but the report found that 62per cent of women covered by private plans did not have coverage for prenatal costs. One issue, says Gerard Anderson, an economist at the Johns Hopkins School of Public Health, is that Americans 'pay individually for each service and pay more for the services we receive'. In other countries, like Denmark, for . instance, women are often charged a single fee for all the services . provided during childbirth - from blood tests to an epidural. 'If a woman wants acupuncture, an epidural or birth in water, . that's what she'll get,' said Charlotte Overgaard, an assistant professor at Aalborg University in Denmark. 'In Denmark, if a woman wants acupuncture, an epidural or birth in water, that's what she'll get' But in the U.S., there is a separate fee for everything from an ultrasound to an epidural to an extra night in a private hospital room. Indeed, one woman told the New York Times that she 'decided to be more assertive about holding down costs' when becoming pregnant with her second child. She only had one ultrasound, kept a list of all the medications she received, received no anesthesia and had a midwife deliver her baby. But when the bill came, it was still over $6,000. 'Even removing the placenta can be coded as a separate charge,' notes the New York Times. And paying higher hospital fees does not ensure better health care; a recent Save the Children report found that America has one of the highest rates . of birth and infant death in the world. Separate charges: In America, services like an epidural, an ultrasound, a blood test, and even placenta removal cost a fee. Many other countries instead charge a flat fee for prenatal care and birth . Problems: The factors that contribute to America's higher cost are excessive testing and ultrasounds, overly 'medicalized' deliveries and a tendency not to use midwives . Post-birth care for mothers also pales in comparison to other countries like France, where women . often remain in hospital for several days after birth, recovering and . learning how to breastfeed. In America, however, they are discharged after one or two days, since most insurance only covers that which is considered medically necessary. Another factor that makes delivery less . expensive in other countries is the frequency of midwives, who are used by only . eight per cent of Americans. By . contrast, 68per cent of births in Britain and 45per cent of births in . the Netherlands are attended by a midwife, who perform simple deliveries, do most of the prenatal examinations, and, according to the New . York Times, can charge less than $325 for an 11-hour delivery. 'Making women choose whether they want to pay $1,000 for an epidural didn't seem right' Americans also tend to have a preference for 'medicalized' deliveries involving IVs, anesthesia, and more ultrasounds than may be necessary, all of which add up. What's more, more than 30per cent of American women have C-sections or drug-induced labor - a far higher percentage than other developed countries. This frequency of C-sections is also 'far above rates that the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists considers necessary'. Some hospitals are trying to combat high costs by introducing all-inclusive flat rates for pregnancy, much like those in other developed countries. At Maricopa Medical Center, for example, a public hospital in Phoenix, Arizona, Dr Dean Coonrod charges uninsured patients a flat fee of $3,850 for vaginal delivery with or without an epidural, and $5,600 for a planned C-section. 'Making women choose during labor whether you want to pay $1,000 for an epidural, that didn't seem right,' said Dr Coonrod.","The average cost of a hospital delivery in America is $9,775, the highest in the world .
In France, delivery costs $3,541, and in the UK it is just $2,641 .
Many industrialized countries offer flat fees for prenatal care and delivery, but in America, there is a separate charge for everything from a blood test to removing the placenta ."
"Brian Chapman is accused of falsely claiming around £45,000 in expenses whilst he was a director at accountants KPMG . A director at top accountancy firm KPMG falsely claimed nearly £45,000 in expenses to feed a gambling habit, a court has heard. Management consultant Brian Chapman, 55, was struggling to maintain payments towards his mortgage and 12 credit cards at the time of the fraud, it is claimed. Although he was earning a gross annual salary of more than £100,000, the Old Bailey was told he had £90,000 debts and lost an average of £330 a month gambling. Chapman allegedly double and triple-claimed the same expenses, including flights, hotels and mobile phone bills. His scam lasted for more than five years until KPMG's risk and control team launched an investigation in 2012, the court heard. Prosecutor Jane Osborne told the court: 'Mr Chapman was a consultant working for KPMG at director level in their financial services sector. 'Travelling was frequently part of that role and he would legitimately incur substantial expenses which had to be claimed back. 'Those expenses were not quite as substantial as those that he claimed for and over the course of a five year period there were almost £45,000 of expenses that he claimed that were not in fact owed to him. 'He did that deliberately, no doubt because at the time his personal financial circumstances were characterised by mounting and very substantial debt.' Miss Osborne said that KPMG's expenses system was at that time run on trust. Chapman was given a corporate American Express charge card but was also allowed to claim back 'out of pocket' expenses backed up with a receipt. Prosecutors say Chapman double and triple-claimed money for flights, hotels and mobile phone bills while at KMPG, whose headquarters are in London's Canary Wharf. He denies fraud . Miss Osborne said: 'What he was doing was quite simple. When an expense was incurred by him he would claim that expense but sometimes he would claim that same expense not once but twice and sometimes three times. 'KPMG has paid off the debt on the Amex card but also transferred money to Mr Chapman ensuring that he benefited personally. 'If it was small sums of money perhaps it could have been done without noticing, but on occasion it was thousands of pounds paid into his bank account.' Chapman's expenses were first investigated when he was identified as one of the company's top 50 debtors to Vodafone, the court heard. Although he had already claimed back some of the bills as expenses, the money had not been passed on to the phone company. Chapman then put the whole amount on his corporate charge card, resulting in double claiming, jurors heard. The case was passed to the City of London Police and it emerged that Chapman had 12 credit cards with a debt totalling £90,000 in October 2007, increasing to £94,000 in October 2011. 'He had also been running an online gambling account with Betfair, betting on a daily basis,' said Miss Osborne. 'He lost more than he won and his monthly loss averaged about £330.' Chapman received a net salary of around £5,500 a month but virtually the whole amount was spent paying his mortgage, his gambling and the monthly credit card minimum payment, it is claimed. Chapman, of Binniehill Road, Cumbernauld, Glasgow, denies a single count of fraud. The trial continues.

"Britain's political class today stands accused of ‘industrialising the countryside’ by allowing the spread of wind and solar farms that have ‘blighted landscapes’ across the UK. Sir Andrew Motion, president of the Campaign to Protect Rural England, condemns the ‘gung-ho’ way in which all three main political parties have put development ahead of protecting ‘Britain’s green spaces’. He warns that the ‘dismaying short-termism’ of British politicians will condemn the countryside to pollution, waste and damage, while ‘derelict sites’ in inner cities are ‘left to rot’. Accusation: Wind farms are 'blighting landscapes' across the UK, claims ex-Poet Laureate Sir Andrew Motion . Sir Andrew – the former Poet Laureate – warns that the changes to planning rules risk leaving greenfield sites in rural areas ‘more vulnerable than ever’ and people with ‘no say’ about new development in their communities. In a coded attack on David Cameron, Sir Andrew accuses the Government of embarking on a ‘second industrial revolution in order to compete in the global race’ – a phrase popularised by the Prime Minister. Condemnation: Sir Andrew says all three main political parties are putting development ahead of protecting 'Britain's green spaces' And taking aim at Ed Miliband, he denounces the Labour leader’s support for towns to expand. Sir Andrew writes: ‘The emerging political consensus, with its gung-ho emphasis on growth, promises a future of urban sprawl and exploitation of the natural world whichever leaders we elect. 'Unless, that is, our politicians think again and recognise the rising public anger about the loss of our green spaces. Mr Cameron has called for the Coalition to ‘ditch the green crap’ and Tory ministers have slashed the subsidy for onshore windfarms. Environment Minister Greg Barker is expected to announce soon that four million solar panels covering land the size of 3,400 football pitches could be built on government land. While the CPRE is a non-political organisation, Sir Andrew’s intervention is significant since he has previously indicated that the group’s members might not turn out to vote for parties who don’t listen to the concerns of rural voters. The group has been highly critical of the Government’s new National Planning Policy Framework, issued last year, which established a presumption in favour of sustainable development – a move that critics say has led to more building on greenfield land. Labour has pledged to review the NPPF . but Mr Miliband has also backed the right of towns to expand so more . houses can be built, at the loss of greenfield land. Attack: In a coded attack on David Cameron (left), Sir Andrew accuses the Government of embarking on a 'second industrial revolution'. He also denounces Ed Miliband's (right) support for towns to expand . He . said: ‘Of course it is right that local communities have a say about . where housing goes. But councils cannot be allowed to frustrate . continually the efforts of others councils to get homes built.’ A . senior Tory source said Sir Andrew’s warnings were simply . ‘attention-seeking’, adding: ‘The NPPF contains explicit protection for . the greenbelt so he clearly hasn’t read it. The greenbelt has been . strengthened. Protecting the countryside is sacrosanct in our plans. It . is not going to be built on.’ As we reach 2014, we come to a fork in the road. In one direction runs a path to a greener, fairer and happier society, nourished by urban regeneration, energy efficiency, and proper protection of the environment. In the other direction runs a stony track surrounded by blighted landscapes, where inner cities and derelict sites are left to rot. Concern: The former Poet Laureate says the emerging political consensus 'promises a future of urban sprawl' Are we really prepared to head down that dismal route? To risk so much of what is precious to us and worth celebrating in our environment? To allow our appetite for economic success to create such pollution, such waste, such damage? Unhappily, it seems that we ordinary people may have no say in the matter. The emerging political consensus, with its gung-ho emphasis on growth, promises a future of urban sprawl and exploitation of the natural world, whichever leaders we elect. Unless, that is, our politicians think again and recognise the rising public anger about the loss of our green spaces. CPRE has warned repeatedly about the Coalition’s planning policies, arguing that they have made England’s countryside – our priceless national inheritance – more vulnerable than ever. Awareness: The former Poet Laureate says politicans need to recognise the rising public anger about the loss of our green spaces . But the situation is even more worrying now the Opposition has jumped on the same bandwagon: for their ‘right to grow’, read ‘right to sprawl’. The solution to our urgent housing needs is not to smear housing estates across open countryside, even if they are dolled up as ‘eco-towns’ or ‘garden cities’. Especially since they probably won’t be affordable to those most in need of a home. Only by concentrating a building programme on England’s 1.5 million brownfield sites can we meet our triple need: to save the countryside, revitalise our cities, and provide the necessary increase in new homes. Economic growth continues to be the politicians’ mantra, and fair enough. But we need green growth that respects the environment and our primal connection with the land. We can’t just go for growth and ignore the reality of climate change, attempting what a Treasury minister has called ‘the biggest programme of infrastructure development since the Victorian era’. The Victorians didn’t have to think about their carbon footprints. We do. And yet all our politicians’ stories about the growth of infrastructure depend on us consuming more fossil fuels, on building more roads and runways. Even farming is implicated in this, with wind and solar farms industrialising the countryside they set out to preserve. So often, this industrialisation simply isn’t necessary. The Energy Minister himself has pointed out that we can meet solar energy targets by installing panels on just 16 per cent of UK commercial and industrial roof-space. And we can dramatically reduce the amount of energy infrastructure we need – and improve our energy security – by focusing on energy efficiency. Driven by a dismaying short-termism, our leaders want to embark on a second industrial revolution in order to compete in ‘the global race’. But the difference in scale alone means we can never compete with the largest economies in the world. So let’s stop pretending we can, and instead make the most of our own particular, distinctive attributes and advantages. Maintaining our irreplaceable countryside must lie at the heart of that ambition. Not just for the sense of benefit and wellbeing that is essential to our humanity, but for good practical reasons as well: for the huge contribution that rural tourism and farming make to the Exchequer.","Sir Andrew Motion condemns main political parties for 'gung-ho' policies .

"A 'Lingerie Legends' American Football match descended into chaos, when a mass brawl ensued between two sides in the Legends Football League. Atlanta Steam and Jacksonville Breeze were competing in an Eastern Conference play-off match, when a Jacksonville player flung a filthy insult at an Atlanta lady during the post-match handshake. Before long both sets of players, along with coaches and officials, were involved in the melee, and one Jacksonville player even appears to strike an Atlanta player with their helmet. Fighting words: A fight between the Atlanta Steam and Jacksonville Breeze began when a Breaze lady had some unkind words for the opposition during the post-game handshake . The free-for-all, caught on camera during what was supposed to be the traditional end-of-match handshakes, has since gone viral.

"American and Iranian leaders tussled Monday afternoon after Iran's Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, said he rejected overtures from the United States to join its coalition aligned against the self-proclaimed Islamic State of Iraq and al-Sham (ISIS). 'The American ambassador in Iraq asked our ambassador [in Iraq] for a session to discuss coordinating a fight against Daesh,' Khamenei said, referring to ISIS by an alternate name in quotes carried by the state-controlled news service IRNA. 'Our ambassador in Iraq reflected this to us, which was welcomed by some [Iranian] officials, but I was opposed. I saw no point in cooperating with a country whose hands are dirty and intentions murky.' Iran has also claimed U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry asked Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif if his country would join the Obama administration's anti-ISIS coalition. In two press briefings hours later, Obama administration officials tried to swat the accusation away as they struggled to maintain that the U.S. has never intended to work with Iran in any way. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Caught in the middle: Iran's supreme leader claims US Secretary of State John Kerry asked the Iranian foreign minister to join America's anti-ISIS coalition, a contention the Obama administration dies -- sort of . Ailing but itching for a fight: Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, shown in his hospital bed with former president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, insisted that he vetoed an American proposal to help defeat ISIS . Noncommittal: White House Press secretary Josh Earnest dodged a question about whether there was a 'request from the United States for cooperation of any kind with the Iranians' Asked if the United States had made any appeals to Tehran for help, White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest would only say, 'Certainly none that I'm aware of.' A reporter asked Earnest to confirm that 'there has been no request from the United States for cooperation of any kind with the Iranians in this battle' against ISIS. Earnest fell back on a policy statement. 'Our posture,' he said, 'is that we are not going to coordinate our military actions or our intelligence sharing activities with the Iranians.' Citing a 'shared interest' of both Iran and the U.S. in defeating ISIS, he acknowledged that 'there will continue to be back-channel communications – back-channel conversation – on this topic between the United States, and other members of the international community, and the Iranians.' But despite 'Iran's significant military capability, and given their significant interest in the outcome' as ISIS mows through territory in neighboring Iraq, he insisted that the Obama administration is not 'going to coordinate with Iran.' Earnest added that are no plans for President Obama and his Iranian counterpart, Hassan Rouhani, to talk when they are both in New York city for a United Nations General Assembly meeting in two weeks. A few blocks away and an hour later at the State Department's headquarters, deputy spokeswoman Marie Harf framed her initial response as a hypothetical. 'I'm not confirming one way or the other any reports of contact' between the two nations, she said. 'We are not going to cooperate' with Iran, Harf added, 'so obviously that would follow that we haven't asked them to.' One reporter pressed her for a more definitive denial. 'Any contact you have had, or may have in the future, will not be an ""ask"" of Iran?' he clarified? 'Correct,' Harf said. 'Absolutely correct.' But then, speaking only in the present tense, she said: 'We're certainly not discussing coordinating with them.' Iran's military could be a fearsome weapon against ISIS, and Iran shares a common interest with the US since Iraq is on its western border . 'We are not going to cooperate' with Iran, State Dept. deputy spokeswoman Marie Harf said vaguely, 'so obviously that would follow that we haven't asked them to' State Dept. chief spokeswoman Jen Psaki tweeted on Monday that the US 'will not coordinate militarily with Iran,' but was silent on the question of whether the Obama administration had ask the Islamic republic to help . State Department chief spokeswoman Jen Psaki refused comment to CBS News about whether any approach was made. Earlier in the day, she tweeted a version of Harf's talking points, writing that 'we are not and will not coordinate militarily with Iran.' Their boss, Secretary of State John Kerry, was in Paris on Monday for an international diplomatic conference aimed at resolving how to hamstring ISIS, which now controls more than one-third of the combined territories of Iraq and Syria. A joint statement issued afterward described a collective aim of defeating ISIS and supporting Iraq 'by any means necessary, including appropriate military assistance.' Representatives from Iran were not invited. Kerry, like the White House, was noncommittal but seemed intent on not slamming any doors in Rouhani's face. 'I have no idea of what interpretation they drew from any discussion that may or may not have taken place,' Kerry told Reuters. 'We are not coordinating with Iran. Period.' Khamenei insisted Monday that he 'rejected' entreaties from Secretary of State John Kerry and from US Ambassador to Iraq Stuart Jones . Angry: Iran's supreme leader, a religious cleric, accused the US -- not ISIS -- of fomenting terrorism . But in his next breath he said he was not 'opposed to the idea of communicating to find out if they will come on board or under what circumstances or whether there is the possibility of a change.' 'Having a channel of communication on one of the biggest issues in the world today,' Kerry said, 'is common sense.' Khamenei, Iran's 75-year-old religious patriarch, appeared less enthusiastic. He had claimed earlier in the day, following his release from a hospital where he had what his government called a routine procedure on his prostate, that 'we are proud that the U.S. has become disappointed at Iran not having a part in a collective wrongdoing.' 'We do not work with the Americans, as they have evil intentions and stained hands,' he said. 'How is it possible to cooperate with Americans under such circumstances?' Now they are lying,' Khamenei charged, 'in saying that it is them who excluded us from their coalition, while it was Iran that refused to participate in this coalition to begin with.' He claimed the Obama administration wanted to regain in Iraq what it once had in Pakistan, 'a playground where they can enter freely and bomb at will.'","Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said he rejected overtures from the United States to join its anti-ISIS coalition .

"Kathryn Anne Fisher, 20, wept as she was told she should be 'thoroughly ashamed of herself' after she admitted theft at Mold Crown Court today . A school secretary has been found guilty of stealing £3,400 of children’s dinner money in order to bankroll herself because she 'couldn't manage her finances'. Kathryn Anne Fisher, 20, wept as she was told she should be 'thoroughly ashamed of herself' after she admitted theft at Mold Crown Court today. The court heard she had abused a position of trust as the school secretary at Pentre Broughton County Primary School near Wrexham. An audit showed discrepancies of £11,600 but Fisher was charged with stealing £3,395, the money which had been paid into her account. Judge Nicolas Parry told her that she should be 'thoroughly ashamed of yourself.' 'This was despicable behaviour, serious dishonesty, theft in breach of a high degree of trust.' But the judge said he believed the secretary, who was of previous good character, was truly sorry for her actions. He said: 'I accept that you are truly remorseful.' Judge . Parry said that she was only 20, and had been a hard-working young . woman, who had acted out of character because she was incapable of . managing her own financial affairs. He said that the thefts were carried out repeatedly over a nine month period in multiple transactions. The thefts were of monies collected from children. 'You would have known that your criminality was highly likely to have an impact upon children, the reputation of the school and upon the reputation of the staff,' Judge Parry told her. The judge said that it may be that the school processes could have been stricter. 'But it is a sad state of affairs if a head teacher at the school cannot trust a member of its staff,' he said. The greatest mitigation was her guilty pleas at the first opportunity for which she would receive maximum credit. She received an eight month youth custody sentence, suspended for 12 months, and was ordered to carry out 300 hours unpaid work. The judge said that she should be 'extremely grateful' to her grandfather who had offered to pay the compensation. He ordered compensation in full within three months. He said a further claim by the school to pay for temporary cover while the defendant was suspended was properly made but he would not order that be paid because of her lack of means. Sarah Morgan, prosecuting, said that Fisher, of Pentre Broughton, admitted 18 charges of theft amounting to £3,395 during a nine month period from Black Lane primary. She was appointed secretary and administrator responsible for money collected, and enter it on daily spreadsheets ready to be banked by the head. Fisher wept as she was told she should be 'thoroughly ashamed of herself' after she admitted theft at Mold Crown Court today . The school became aware that sheets had been filled in incorrectly, an audit was undertaken and discrepancies of £11,600 was discovered. She had been charged with the money that had been paid into her bank. Initially she denied doing anything wrong but in November made admissions of taking money to fund her life-style. It was a small school with about 150 pupils. Mark Davies, defending, said that Fisher - who had led an unblemished life - had started to take money with the intention of repaying it. He handed in references and a letter from the defendant - together with a copy of the local newspaper which had caused great shame and embarrassment, the whole family had been affected by the report. As a result of which there has been abuse, threats and indeed has resulted in causing Miss Fisher so much distress that she made an attempt to take an overdose, he said. She had been employed for a comparatively short period of time and the auditor’s report showed that she had been able to take advantage of the fact that controls abound banking and reconciliation were weak at the school. If there had been a greater degree of supervision, the matter would not have gone on for so long and the amounts would have been less, it was claimed. 'I am not for a second trying to blame other people for what she has done,' he explained.","Kathryn Fisher, 20, wept as she was .

"Alistair Darling skewered Alex Salmond before the live TV debate even started, by telling his rival to pretend they liked each other as the cameras rolled, it emerged today. Mr Darling made the gibe as they shook hands at the beginning of the showdown, which saw Mr Salmond hammered over his currency plans if Scots back independence in next month's referendum. The Better Together campaign said it was proof Mr Darling was calling the shots, as Mr Salmond was forced to desperately insist: 'It's Scotland's pound and we are keeping it.' Scroll down for video . Alistair Darling (right) made the gibe as he shook hands with Alex Salmond before the start of the TV debate which has electrified the referendum campaign . Mr Darling was widely regarded to have triumphed in Tuesday night's debate, repeatedly challenging his opponent over the detail of how independence would work in practice. Microphones which were left on as the two men shook hands for the cameras before the debate picked up how Mr Darling planned to dominate the clash. As they were applauded by the audience, he was heard to tell Mr Salmond: 'Pretend we're pleased to see each other,' The Sun reported. One of the biggest threats to the Yes campaign has been growing doubts about the currency an independent Scotland would use. After ditching the idea of adopting the euro, the SNP has claimed it would enter a currency union with the UK and continue to use the pound. However the Tories, Labour and Lib Dems have all made clear they would block a deal, whoever wins the next general election. Mr Darling hammered his rival over his plans for a currency if Scots back independence in next month's referendum . During the TV debate, Mr Darling drew huge applause when he told Mr Salmond: 'Any eight-year-old can tell you the flag of a country, the capital of a country and its currency. 'I presume the flag is the Saltire, I assume our capital will still be Edinburgh, but you can't tell us what currency we will have. What is an eight-year-old going to make of that?' Yesterday Mr Salmond resorted to playground tactics as his currency plans for a separate Scotland fell into chaos. Labour leader Ed Miliband today insisted he would block any currency union between an independent Scotland and the rest of the UK . He said the rest of the UK would have to accept a deal because it would be the 'sovereign will' of the people of Scotland following a Yes vote – ignoring the views of those in England, Wales and Northern Ireland. But in a speech today Labour leader Ed Miliband insisted he would veto a currency union if he becomes Prime Minister after next year's general election. He warned the risks to the UK of sharing the pound with an independent Scotland would outweigh the benefits of cutting the UK national debt or preventing cross-border transaction costs. Scotland's share of the UK debt would amount to about £120 billion - around £5 billion a year in repayments. But the Scottish Government has threatened to withhold its share if the UK does not agree to share the pound. Speaking after an address to the Scottish Chambers of Commerce in Glasgow, Mr Miliband said: 'Of course you want to avoid the transaction costs, which is one of the reasons we want the UK to stay together. 'But I'm afraid the cost of a currency union without political union, without a fiscal union, without banking union, are costs that will be too high for the UK.' But Scottish Financial Secretary John Swinney told BBC Radio Scotland, said: 'The position will crumble after a Yes vote in the referendum because what Mr Miliband or Mr Cameron or Mr Clegg or whoever is leading the United Kingdom after the 2015 election would have to do would be they would have to say to the rest of the UK 'Look, we're going to put a barrier up for your trade with Scotland which would increase the cost for business in the rest of the UK by £500 million, we're going to undermine sterling by rejecting the contribution made by oil and gas and whisky into a sterling area, and we're also going to absolve the Scots of a GBP120 billion share of the UK debt which translates into an annual cost of GBP5 billion a year, simply because we won't agree to a currency union'.","Darling made gibe at his rival moments before televised showdown .

"Police forces can never be free of corruption, a Scotland Yard chief has admitted. Alaric Bonthron, head of anti-corruption at the Metropolitan Police, said trying to stop criminals infiltrating the ranks was a very difficult challenge. ‘There is a threat to any law enforcement agency,’ said the detective chief superintendent. Challenge: Alaric Bonthron, head of Scotland Yard's anti-corruption unit, said corruption will always exist . ‘You will never eliminate corruption. You can make it very difficult and put systems in place. Organised crime by its very nature is very challenging. ‘Has corruption gone away entirely? I don’t think it has, you have always got vulnerabilities. ‘Part of our role is to make sure the organisation is absolutely doing the best it can to be corruption-proof.’ Mr Bonthron, who took charge of the Metropolitan Police’s Professional Standards Unit nine months ago, said 99 per cent of officers are ‘honest, law-abiding individuals’. Previously the work of the PSU has been shrouded in secrecy due to the nature of its work. But in a frank interview, Mr Bonthron told The Independent newspaper: ‘One officer, one member of staff, headline news … and it discredits the organisation.’ Temptation: Sir Hugh Orde, president of the Association of Chief Police Officers, sparked outrage among some MPs last week when he said poorly-paid junior officers were more susceptible to bribes to make ends meet . The officer, who has worked in the police in London for 29 years, denied that the Met was rife with ‘endemic corruption’, as has been claimed was the case in the Eighties and Nineties when some of Britain’s most notorious criminals were allegedly able to gain influence and information to compromise investigations. He said the Met’s Directorate of Professional Standards has 385 staff, spending £24 million every year. Sir Hugh Orde, one of Britain’s top officers, warned recently that police are more likely to take bribes if they are underpaid and have money problems. Sir Hugh pointed to the £19,000 starting salary for junior PCs and said that financial pressure felt by ‘certain ranks’ could fuel a wave of corruption.","Comments were made by Met Police anti-corruption boss Alaric Bonthron .

"Fetuses aborted in Canada have been burned at an energy plant to provide power to Oregon homes, the British Columbia Health Ministry has admitted. The biomedical waste shipped to the Covanta Marion plant in Brooks, Oregon also includes 'surgically removed cancerous tissue' and amputated limbs, officials revealed in an email. The unsettling details emerged in email correspondence between a Vancouver-based newspaper, the B.C. Catholic, and officials from the British Columbia Health Ministry. 'The ministry understands that some . [biomedical waste] is transferred to Oregon,' the email said. 'There it . is incinerated in a waste-to-energy plant.' Revelations: Medical waste shipped from Canada to the waste-to-energy Covanta Marion plant in Brooks, Oregon (pictured) includes fetal tissue, cancerous tissue and amputated limbs, it has emerged . The Marion County board of commissioners has now ordered the incinerator to stop accepting boxed medical waste to generate electricity. Sam Brentano, chairman of the board, said it is taking immediate action to prohibit human tissue from future deliveries at the plant that has been turning waste into energy since 1987. 'We provide an important service to the people of this state and it would be a travesty if this program is jeopardized due to this finding,' he said in a statement. 'We thought our ordinance excluded this type of material at the waste-to-energy facility. We will take immediate action to ensure a process is developed to prohibit human tissue from future deliveries.' When contacted by The Associated Press on Wednesday, a Covanta Marion representative said he did not know if fetal tissue was included in shipments from Canada or elsewhere. Commissioners in Marion County did not . say why they ever believed medical waste shipped to the plant should be . free of fetal tissue. Waste: The county has banned the incinerator accepting medical waste to generate electricity (file picture) The facility is owned and operated by Covanta in a partnership with Marion County. According to its website, it processes 550 tons per day of municipal solid waste, generating up to 13 megawatts of energy sold to Portland General Electric. Marion County estimates that the facility processes about 700 tons of in-county medical waste each year and about 1,200 tons from elsewhere, making it a small percentage of the total waste burned. Out-of-town medical waste is charged a higher fee. County spokeswoman Jolene Kelley said medical waste has been included in the program for some time, but the commissioners never had any indication that fetal tissue might be included. 'We learned that today,' she said. The B.C. Catholic reported that around 14,000 fetuses are aborted in the province each year and some parents - 'few' - choose the option of a conventional funeral service. Most leave the waste to be discarded by hospitals. Since they have no idea what's been arriving in the sealed shipments, the commissioners decided to temporarily suspend all medical waste, Kelley said. They've scheduled an emergency hearing for Thursday and might rewrite an ordinance to clarify what type of material can be accepted. Covanta Marion is believed to be the only plant generating energy from waste in Oregon. The Environmental Protection Agency says medical waste from hospitals is generally excluded from the municipal solid waste used to generate electricity. The details come one month after it emerged that the . remains of more than 15,000 aborted babies were incinerated, along with other 'medical waste', to heat and generate . power for British hospitals.","The British Columbia Health Ministry has admitted that fetal tissue, cancerous tissue and amputated limbs have been shipped to Oregon .

"Sarah Palin was photographed sweaty and make-up free as she ran errands around Anchorage, Alaska on Monday - marking the first time she's been seen in public since a violent family fight this weekend. A fight allegedly broke out at a house party most of the Palin family was attending on Saturday night in south Anchorage, when daughter Willow's ex-boyfriend Connor Cleary tried to get in a Hummer limousine after engaging in some unspecified 'questionable behavior'. Sarah's eldest son Track left the fight with four broken ribs and husband Todd suffered a bloody nose. Scroll down for video . No make-up Monday: Former vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin was pictured running errands in Anchorage, Alaska on Monday . Trouble at home? Palin appeared to have just worked out when she was photographed, wearing casual dress and without her wedding right . Palin looked like she had other things on her mind as she stepped out in the casual attire and with damp hair . Bristol Palin (pictured right) and little sister Piper (left) hit Costco in Anchorage, Alaska on Monday to stock up on groceries including bulk purchases of toilet paper, bottled water, yogurt, whipped cream and apple sauce. The Palin family were recently caught up in a reported disturbance at a house party in Anchorage . RealClearPolitics spoke with a source close to the Palin family, who wanted to provide their version of the events in question. The source said oldest son Track, 25, soon found himself struggling against four men who had 'piled on him'. That was when father Todd Palin - who was celebrating his 50th birthday that night, although it was not his party- became involved. Partygoer Eric Thompson told Good Morning America: 'I heard Sarah Palin scream out, 'You know who we are, don't you?'' Palin was captured make-up free as she ran errands in her first appearance since the family brawl . Palin is pictured for the first time since the incident, which involved 'roughly 20 people' at a house party . But the source told the website Palin was shouting: 'Don't you know who he is? He's a vet!' Her son Track served with the U.S. Army in the Iraq War. Exes: The fight allegedly broke out when Willow Palin's ex-boyfriend Connor Cleary (pictured) tried to get in a Hummer limousine after engaging in 'questionable behavior' According to the source, Track left the fight nursing four cracked ribs, while his father suffered a bloody nose. The former vice presidential candidate has yet to publicly comment on the brawl. On Monday, she left a shopping mall dressed casually, and without wearing her wedding ring. Her daughters Bristol, 23, and 13-year-old Piper were also spotted out and about on Monday in Anchorage, stocking up on food supplies at a CostCo. The two sisters looked serious as they pushed a cart into the parking lot, filled to the brim with bulk purchases of toilet paper, bottled water, apple sauce, yogurt and whipped cream. Several local sources reported on the incident, initially scooped by Alaska political blogger Amanda Coyne. She wrote: 'Word is that Bristol has a particularly strong right hook, which she employed repeatedly.' But the source said that Bristol is left-handed. One report suggested host Korey Klingenmeyer was allegedly punched in the face seven times by Bristol when he politely asked her to leave the party. Another report claimed that Willow and Bristol apparently tried to go after the mother of Willow's ex-boyfriend. The fight involved 'roughly 20 people' and alcohol is believed to have been a factor in the incident, which took place around 11pm on Saturday night, The Anchorage Police Department said. 'Anchorage police responded to a report of a verbal and physical altercation taking place between multiple subjects outside of a residence,' police spokesperson Jennifer Castro told Alaska Dispatch News. 'A preliminary investigation by police revealed that a party had been taking place at a nearby residence and a fight had broken out between multiple subjects outside of the residence. 'At the time of the incident, none of the involved parties wanted to press charges and no arrests were made. 'Alcohol was believed to have been a factor in the incident. Some of the Palin family members were in attendance at the party.' Although none of the parties wanted to press charges at the time of the incident, police confirmed that the case is still an active investigation and is being reviewed by APD and the Municipal Prosecutors Office. It had been reported that the drunken brawl started when the Palin pack allegedly had a run-in with Connor Cleary, an ex-boyfriend of Willow, 20 (pictured to the left of her mother, in a blue dress). The Palins are pictured in 2007 . Sarah Palin has claimed that she owes the United States a 'global apology' for the 2008 Republican presidential ticket's loss to President Barack Obama and Vice President Joe Biden. During an interview with Fox News' Sean Hannity, Mrs Palin, who ran for vice-president on John McCain's ticket, spoke about Obama's long-term strategy for defeating ISIS, which he laid out in a speech on Wednesday night. 'As I watched the speech last night, Sean, the thought going through my mind is, I owe America a global apology,' she said. 'Because John McCain, through all of this, John McCain should be our president.' She added: 'It's not just a vision that's so obvious. It's an articulated mission that they're on, and that is the caliphate. That is a takeover of the region. And guess what? We're next on the hit list.' The former Alaskan governor compared ISIS to Hitler and questioned how seriously Obama is taking the threat. She said: 'So when Barack Obama, like the rest of us, hear these bad guys, these terrorists, promising that they will raise the flag of Allah over our White House, for the life of me I don't know why he does not take this serious, the threat. Because yes, it's more than a vision. 'They're telling - just like Hitler did all those years ago, when a war could've been avoided, because Hitler, too, did not hide his intentions. Well, ISIS, these guys aren't hiding their intentions either.'","The former VP candidate was pictured running errands in Anchorage, Alaska on Monday .

When the odds were better and Fowler wanted Jake to win,  he would feed him Viagra or a testosterone-based drug – then watch him ‘run his head off’. John Ellwood, prosecuting for the RSPCA, said police interviewed Fowler last September after receiving reports he was involved in selling cannabis. Mr Ellwood said: ‘He admitted in interview that he fed his greyhounds cannabis when he wanted them to lose races. He did so by boiling the cannabis. ‘When he wanted the dog to win the race he injected it with a drug which turns out to be nandrolone, which is a testosterone derivative. Race fixing: Fowler would also give dogs cannabis to slow them so they would lose races, a court heard (File picture) ‘He explained that the nandrolone and travel sickness pills which he had would affect the way the dogs would run and in particular he showed the officer Viagra tablets which according to him make them “run their heads off”.’ A greyhound trainer fed his dogs Viagra to run faster . Fowler was interviewed by an RSPCA inspector at a later date but by this time Jake was dead. He escaped jail for causing unnecessary suffering to Jake but was given an 18-week custodial sentence, suspended for 18 months, and ordered to pay £1,000 costs at £10 a week. Mr Ellwood told Hartlepool Magistrates' Court that Fowler had Jake put down after he injured his shoulder at a race track. The grandfather, from Stockton-on-Tees, previously admitted two charges of causing unnecessary suffering to Jake and two charges of administering drugs to a dog knowing it to be poisonous. John Nixon, defending, said there was no evidence Jake suffered anything other than being lethargic after taking cannabis and pointed out that police sniffer dogs often ingest the drug. Banned: Fowler escaped jail at Hartlepool Magistrates Court but is now allowed to keep dogs for the rest of his life .",Trainer pumped dog full of Viagra to speed it up and cannabis to slow it down .
"Italy and France need to work 'harder and faster' to resolve their structural problems, a senior ally of German chancellor Angela Merkel said today. Michael Meister, a key figure in Merkel's Christian Democrats, said: 'Italy and France have structural problems to resolve and not economic problems. 'They can't wait any longer. More time won't relieve the problem. It'll only make it worse.' However, French president Francois Hollande warned that the EU's austerity policy was threatening the continent's stability and could even see Europe 'wiped out from the world map'. The most unpopular president in the history of the Fifth Republic: France has fallen into recession on the year anniversary of Francois Hollande, pictured with his partner Valerie Trierweiler, coming to power . A new damning book highlights the privileged background of Francois Hollande, pictured celebrating with his companion Valerie Trierweiler (who graduated from Pantheon-Sorbonne listed by The Times as one of the top 100 universities for its reputation) - after winning the presidential second round . Figures yesterday showed France has plunged back into recession exactly a year after Hollande took office, piling more . misery on the beleaguered socialist leader. Italian government bond yields have also fallen in recent months while the eurozone is suffering its longest ever downturn. The French economic collapse, confirmed last night, means that nine of the 17 eurozone countries are now in recession. Mr Hollande told a news conference in . Paris that the financial crisis is now 'behind us', but predicted that . widespread austerity measures could push the continent into a fresh . disaster. 'What is hitting Europe is a recession provoked by the austerity policy,' he said. 'If Europe does not advance it will . fall or even be wiped out from the world map - my duty is to bring . Europe out of its lethargy.' Gumbel said that while British Prime Minister David Cameron, left, comes under scrutiny for surrounding himself with the Oxbridge elite, he is harmless compared to French President Francois Hollande, pictured right . Mr Meister said the European Central Bank should . stop buying Italian government debt if Italy failed to meet its debt . reduction requirements . The value of Italian bonds has fallen as investors put their faith in the . ECB's ability to prevent indecisive elections earlier this year driving . Italy into full-blown crisis. But Mr Meister's comments to the Neue . Osnabruecker Zeitung newspaper also come just as Germany's campaign for . the September election gets into full swing. He said Italy urgently needed to work on improving its competitiveness and consolidating its budget. 'That's the job of national political . leaders and not the ECB,' he said. He added the new Italian government . was capable of taking the necessary action and the country has a . relatively strong industry. 'Italy can do it on its own strength,' he said. 'Old boys' club': French minister of Economy, Finances and Foreign Trade Pierre Moscovici, . pictured left with British Chancellor of the Exchequer and Oxford . graduate George Osborne, attended the prestigious École nationale d'administration where Hollande was educated and which has just 100 graduates a year . Meanwhile figures showed that France, the single currency’s second largest economy, saw its output shrink by 0.2 per cent in the first three months of the year. As . it shrank by the same amount in the final three months of 2012, it . means France has experienced a double-dip recession – after the economy . contracted in 2009 when the banking crisis sparked the deepest global . slump since the Second World War . Mr Hollande is the most unpopular . president in French history, according to opinion polls. He has often . been criticised for his handling of the economy, ridiculed for . attempting and failing to introduce a 75 per cent tax on the wealthiest, . and lampooned for his personal life and his relationship with partner . Valerie Trierweiler. Under the tenure of the tax-and-spend . Left-winger, the country has seen unemployment soar and business . confidence drop. Unemployment in France has reached 3.22 million, or . 10.6 per cent, the worst since 1997. Youth unemployment is  25.4 per . cent. Under Mr Hollande, the French economy . has failed to grow at all. In contrast, the UK avoided re-entering . recession – two consecutive quarters of decline. Our economy grew by 0.3 . per cent between January and March. European Commission President Jose . Manuel Barroso urged Mr Hollande to proceed faster with economic reforms . in return for being granted two more years to bring its budget deficit . below the EU limit. France had to make up for 20 years of lost competitiveness and reduce ‘the exorbitant weight of debt’ on its economy, he said. French finance minister Pierre . Moscovici blamed the decline on the moribund economies of the countries . around it. He said: ‘We are in Europe, the eurozone countries are our . main clients and our main suppliers, and when the environment around us . is depressed, well, that’s the main factor in the slowing of the French . economy.’ Breaking the mold: Former French Justice Minister Rachida Dati rose to high government from relatively humble origins as the second of 12 children born to a Moroccan father and an Algerian mother . The bad news for the French economy . came as the recession across the 17-nation eurozone – of which Britain . is not a member – entered its sixth consecutive quarter, falling 0.2 per . cent. The euro bloc has been in recession . since the end of 2011, but this is the first time that the economic . malaise has spread to the core nations, France and Germany. Germany, the largest economy, narrowly . avoided entering recession after its economy grew 0.1 per cent, up from . a decline of 0.7 per cent last quarter. Portugal, Spain and Italy, . officially remain in recession, with Ireland, Malta and debt-hit . Slovenia still to report on the last quarter. The economies of all three . shrank at the end of 2012. Unemployment across the eurozone is at . a record high of 12.1 per cent, and in countries such as Greece is as . high as 27.2 per cent.

"Splash out on a jet-ski, learn to play the guitar and knit – that is how to beat the recession blues, according to a self-help guru created by new Tory chairman Grant Shapps. Mr Shapps, who was promoted  in last week’s reshuffle, used the fictional alter ego ‘Michael Green’ to write motivational material for the internet marketing company he founded, HowToCorp. But Mr Green’s 2010 tome How To Bounce Back From Recession is unlikely to be on the bedside table of Chancellor George Osborne, with its baffling gobbledegook, bizarre tips – and advice on borrowing your way out of recession. Tips: Grant Shapps was promoted to Tory party co-chairman in the cabinet reshuffle last week . For instance, those who find themselves unemployed are advised that it is ‘ree-dic-clu-ous’ to blame themselves for their predicament. To put themselves in a more positive frame of mind, Mr Green suggests that they take up cycling, fishing, learning to play the guitar or even knitting. ‘Cut out the riotous living,’ he adds. ‘Barter for goods or services... be as good to you as you can. Everyone, even the primary breadwinner, needs some time out from worry and stress. Learn skills or hobbies [eg] playing an instrument, weaving a shawl [or] carpentry.’ Mr Green also offers other suggestions, including taking advantage of low interest rates ‘to buy a house or vehicle, or just borrow money... Prices are low for package vacations and cruises. Many recreational vehicles, cycles, snowmobiles and ATVs [all-terrain vehicles], boats, jet-skis and watercraft, and even airplanes and timeshares are being offered’. Mr Shapps is at pains to point out . that he no longer masquerades as Mr Green and had no involvement in the . recession book. He passed his share of the company behind HowToCorp to . his wife Belinda in 2008. But . Mr Green lives on as a lingering reminder of Mr Shapps’ previous . career, and continues to generate income for the HowToCorp. Yesterday, . The Guardian newspaper claimed that Google had blacklisted a series of . websites linked to HowToCorp for deploying techniques to raise them . higher up  search rankings – and therefore boost advertising revenue – . against the internet giant’s policies. Mr Shapps’ aides disputed the . claims and said that his lawyers were looking at the allegations carefully. As recently as 2010, a rival internet business linked Mr Shapps' background to Mr Green. Alter-ego: A description of 'Michael Green' appears on a blog offering money-saving tips, accompanied by a picture of an unidentified male . Thedailyincome.com, a blog offering money-making tips and links, described Michael Green as  ‘a member of the UK Parliament’ who ‘actually flies his very own  personal plane and lives in a fabulous mansion’. Mr Shapps holds a pilot’s licence. The account ran next to a picture of an unidentified male, who was wearing a jumper similar to the sort favoured by Mr Shapps. While Mr Shapps is part of a  Government which is trying to curb the public-sector wage bill, Mr Green advises readers to move into ‘recession-proof’, taxpayer-funded jobs in teaching or healthcare. Other references are simply baffling, such as the advice: ‘Beware the hungry hippos of the business jungles and swamps!’ The guide concludes: ‘The roller-coaster ride of the recession will eventually  end and you will get off. We want to help ensure you are smiling and refreshed – not blown to bits and dragging.’ Mr Green is also the author of another of the company’s publications, The Meaning Of Your Dreams, in which he promises readers will soon be ‘relieving your repressed emotions’ and ‘indulging in life, freely and unhampered’. Other ‘toolkits’ produced by the company include How To Find  Happiness, How To Achieve The Swing In Golf and of particular interest to Mr Shapps in his campaigning new job: How To Promote A Product. He set up the web sales business with his wife in 2002, three years before he became the MP for Welwyn Hatfield. After he transferred his share of the company to his wife, she took over the pen name of Michael Green. A spokeswoman for Mr Shapps said yesterday that he did not derive any income or dividends from HowToCorp and was not involved with it in any way. She added that the Daily Income blog had nothing to do with Mr Shapps – and said that the MP had no idea where the website had got its information from, or who the man in the photograph was.","Grant Shapps was promoted to Tory party co-chairman in the cabinet reshuffle .

"Arsenal striker Olivier Giroud dealt with the news he will be out for the rest of 2014 by watching his side qualify for a 17th consecutive Champions League group stage on TV with his left foot elevated on a pile of blankets. The France international striker underwent surgery on Wednesday after picking up an injury later revealed to be a small fracture near his ankle in the dying minutes of Saturday’s 2-2 draw with Everton. After Arsenal beat Besiktas 1-0 courtesy a goal from makeshift striker Alexis Sanchez, Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger revealed he could be without his number one marksman until as late as January.

Nightmare:  Arsenal physio Colin Lewin attends to Giroud after he sustained an ankle injury late in the match . ‘He had surgery today and it went well but he will be out for competitive action at top level until end of December, beginning of January,' Wenger revealed after the match. The absence of Giroud, who picked up the freak injury when the ball smashed into the sole of his boot forcing his foot towards his shin, leaves Wenger with a short supply of recognised strikers. But the manager says the set-back won't force him into a panic purchase. ‘I don’t know yet [on signing another striker] but we try to look around and we want quality. We have that with Walcott coming back soon - we have Podolski, Sanogo and Campbell too. ‘You can't always buy if you have a problem. If you have an injury after September 1, you have to live with it. ‘I bought Sanchez to be a striker. Walcott can be very good. Sanogo and Podolski can play there.

"As the autumn sun shone down and the ear-splitting sounds of pipes and drums from thousands of Orange Order marchers filled Edinburgh, the Californian tourists could not have been happier. ‘This is so fabulous,’ said Mary, a film location scout, smiling as her husband snapped away with his camera at loyalists parading along the Royal Mile in their bowler hats and banners. ‘We are watching history in the making on our holiday.’ Perhaps. There are just 100 hours to go until voting starts in the independence referendum that will define Britain’s future, yet it remains impossible to determine if we are witnessing a seismic moment in our island’s story. Scroll down for video . There are just 100 hours to go until voting starts in the referendum that will define Britain’s future . Yesterday the two rival camps fanned out in force across Scotland, that famous blue-and-white Saltire fluttering from hundreds of stalls as thousands of campaigners argued over independence. But the result – the future of a 307-year-old union – remains poised on a knife-edge. The latest poll released yesterday by Better Together gave the No camp an eight-point lead, showing a recent barrage of warnings from business leaders and economists may have tilted the balance. But their rivals Yes Scotland insisted results from 25,000 canvas daily returns gave them a majority. And, confusingly, another poll showed the Yes campaign eight points in the lead instead of behind. Last night this astonishing battle for Britain intensified as the No campaign warned that with five days left, nationalists had not answered key questions on jobs, pensions, public services and the pound. Alistair Darling, the former Labour Chancellor leading the campaign to preserve the United Kingdom, said the referendum was the biggest decision most Scots would ever make – yet critical issues were not resolved. ‘We still don’t know with five days to go what currency we would have,’ he said. ‘How confident can we be that our public services will be funded?’ His campaign, which saw a 22-point lead wiped out, has been accused of lacking energy to counter the romantic appeal of independence. But Darling insisted he was confident of victory with the support of ‘the silent majority’ – and even displayed a rare burst of passion. ‘If we vote to leave by just one vote then that is it. If we leave, there is absolutely no going back. It is not just for a generation but for our children’s children.’ Alistair Darling, the former Labour Chancellor leading the campaign to preserve the United Kingdom, said the referendum was the biggest decision most Scots would ever make – yet critical issues were not resolved . The stumbling No campaign has been hampered by personal feuds among key Labour figures. The Tories are so reviled in Scotland they have taken a back seat, even though there is so much at stake the vote potentially threatens the Prime Minister’s future. But yesterday Gordon Brown, re-invigorated by this referendum after his dismal days in Downing Street, delivered another fiesty speech in his Kirkcaldy constituency. ‘None of us here should allow it to be said that anybody who votes No is less patriotic and less proud of our country. We are patriotic Scots with a patriotic vision for the future.’ There is anger among many supporters of the union at the way SNP leader Alex Salmond has portrayed the independence vote as a struggle between Scotland and Westminster. ‘I am Scottish and proud of it, so who is he to tell me that I am unpatriotic by voting to keep the greatest political union the world has ever seen,’ one Edinburgh lawyer said to me. ‘I’m sick of this nationalism which is so divisive.’ This came from a man I have known for three decades whom I have never seen so impassioned on a political issue – or so infuriated by a leader. It indicated how tensions are rising as this landmark vote comes close. Salmond was on the back foot yesterday over threats of revenge against companies opposing separation, as Marks and Spencer and several phone companies became the latest to warn prices would rise following independence. The First Minister slapped down Jim Sillars, a former deputy leader of his party who warned such firms faced ‘a day of reckoning’. Salmond said the day after a Yes vote would be one of celebration, not reckoning, with opposing sides uniting in ‘Team Scotland’. ‘We must rise above these underhand Tory tactics and be confident of the new spirit in Scotland,’ he said. ‘The people are in no mood to be bullied by big Westminster government putting pressure on big business to intimidate the people of Scotland.’ 'We are patriotic Scots with a patriotic vision for the future': Gordon Brown delivered another feisty speech on behalf of the No campaign on Saturday . Orangewomen march during a pro union parade, less than a week before voters go to the polls . Yet Sillars kept up his attacks yesterday, accusing Bob Dudley, BP’s chief executive who has put out an anti-independence statement, of being ‘an agent of Downing Street.’ However a study by Deutsche Bank claimed a vote for separation would go down as one of the great political and economic mistakes of recent history, warning of negative consequences ‘far beyond what people had imagined.’ Rather incredibly, the future of the UK hinges this week upon a vote in which only one in 14 of the country’s citizens will participate. It could impact on everything from the economy to our place on the United Nations Security Council. When the referendum was announced in 2011, polls put backing for independence at under 35 per cent. Last week a YouGov poll put Yes in front, which woke up those south of the border. The Orange Order march – disowned by Yes campaigners although the organisation’s membership in Scotland is bigger than any political party – underlined this sudden focus on the debate. Ron Bather, grand master of the Grand Orange Lodge of England, told a rally: ‘To you Scottish sisters and brethren, this coming week is your chance to defeat once and for all the separatists, the people that want to change your way of life.’ Another speaker put it in familiar loyalist terms. ‘No to independence and no surrender to separatism.’ Joining the 15,000 marchers were loyalists from Liverpool in Union Jack suits, children from Glasgow dressed as ‘King Billy’ and even a stag party of Protestants from Donegal. ‘We’re supporting Scotland to stay part of the UK,’ said Jason Mahon, 27, the bridegroom. Logan, seven, joined the Orange Lodge March Edinburgh in support of the No Campaign . As the parade passed a restaurant draped with Yes posters, its owner said their involvement would push moderates into the separatist camp. ‘They don’t seem to realise this campaign is for people like them, to build a new community in Scotland,’ he added, shaking his head sadly. Amid the swirl of claim and counter-claim, it is clear many Scots remain confused despite the intensity of debate. Darling claimed yesterday 500,000 voters – one in eight of those eligible to vote – are still to finalise their decision. Given the lack of comparative polling data, the reduction of voting age to 16 and the anticipated turnout of 80 per cent, it remains a highly unpredictable contest. The appeal of the separatist cause was highlighted yesterday by a prominent Tory donor declaring support for independence. ‘I look forward to awaken to the dawning of a new Scotland [...] confident [...] to face the next 100 years and beyond as an independent nation,’ said John McGlynn, founder of the Airlink Group of car parks. Already this ballot has become the biggest political betting event in history, with stakes reaching the same level as the last British General Election and US presidential contest combined. One punter gambled £800,000 on a No vote. Yes Scotland claimed it will have 35,000 volunteers at 500 street stalls over the weekend in a last push to persuade people, with more than 2.6m leaflets being delivered. Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland’s deputy first minister, said they would focus on job-creation and the health service in the final days of campaigning; few dare point out how the Scottish NHS costs more and achieves worse outcomes than south of the border. Sturgeon said: ‘The Yes campaign has been carried along by a flourishing of self-confidence among people in Scotland. This means we can say with certainty to people still making up their mind: ‘Let’s do this.’ The world is watching with great interest, especially since Catalonia’s government holds a similar referendum on independence from Spain in two months time. Prominent Putin supporters and North Korean leader Kim Jong-Un have backed independence, while President Obama supports the status quo. Even a No vote looks set to alter the political landscape after the panicked pledge by all three main party leaders to offer ‘devo max’ to Scotland. This prompted Ukip’s Nigel Farage to demand a ‘new constitutional settlement’ for voting at Westminster on English matters. But yesterday saw signs of a backlash against federalisation in Britain with Tory MP Christopher Chope warning that there was no guarantee the promised powers would get through parliament. One more thing for those 4m voters to ponder as they enter polling booths from the Highlands and Islands to Edinburgh, Glasgow and the borders. Their decision on Thursday could determine all our futures.","Just 100 hours to go until voting starts in the independence referendum .

"Beth Prout has been denied potentially life-saving treatment for a rare stomach lining cancer . A Welsh nurse has been forced to wait for potentially life-saving treatment after local health bosses refused to fund her care in England. Beth Prout, from Pembroke, West Wales, has been diagnosed with a rare form of stomach cancer. There are two hospitals in the UK able to provide the treatment the 57-year-old needs. But NHS chiefs in Wales have refused to cover the cost of sending her to England for therapy. A hospital in Manchester has agreed to provide the care, which could save Ms Prout's life. Welsh NHS bosses have agreed to pay £1,000 for an assessment, but are 'awaiting further clinical information' before reviewing her case. The mother-of-two said: 'If I lived in England I'd be in hospital now. 'I've worked all my life and paid taxes to central government. Because I live in Wales I've been treated as a second-class citizen. 'You hear about a postcode lottery, with people not getting treatment because of where they live. I'm fighting this for them too.' The single mother is battling a rare form of cancer in her stomach lining and needs specialist treatment. The Christie Hospital in Manchester has agreed to assess and treat her. Ms Prout is now battling with a health committee of the Welsh NHS to try and get funding after bosses refused to send her to Manchester in August. She has gone to her local MP, Simon Hart, who is helping her challenge the Welsh NHS ruling. Mr Hart asked the Welsh Health Specialised Services Committee (WHSSC) to reconsider their decision, and earlier this month Ms Prout's doctor appealed on her behalf, branding the decision 'unethical'. Mr Hart said: 'I'm shocked and saddened by what is happening to Beth and others refused treatment by NHS Wales, which would be available if they lived in England.' Responsibility for health care in Wales was passed to the Welsh Government under devolution in 1999. In England, Clinical Commissioning Groups (CCGs) are responsible for deciding on which specific care services are needed in each local area. In Wales, that responsibility falls to seven Local Health Boards (LHBs). Each LHB is responsible for delivering all NHS healthcare services in its geographical area. Due to this structure, a so-called 'postcode lottery' has emerged, whereby local decision-making and budgets determine the allocation of healthcare services. Ms Prout, pictured with her daugther Kate Prout, soon to be daughter-in-law Samantha Ward, and granddaughter Isla Morgan, has been accepted for treatment at a Manchester hospital but was told the NHS in Wales would not cover the £7,000 cost across the border . It means access to cancer drugs, for example, is restricted in some areas, while patients living in neighbouring health authorities  - such as even a few miles away over the border in England - are able to be prescribed the same treatment on the NHS. The Welsh Health Specialised Services Committee has said it will now pay the £1,000 cost for Ms Prout to have an assessment. A spokesman said: 'We are currently awaiting further clinical information on this case so that it can be considered by the all-Wales Individual Patient Funding Request Panel (IPFR panel) which makes decisions on such cases. 'In this particular case it has already been agreed that a clinical assessment will be funded in order to understand if the peritoneal disease can be managed by CRS and HIPEC. 'Once there is a clear clinical judgement, then the IPFR panel will be able to make a clinical decision on the best way forward for this individual.' Last week it emerged multiple sclerosis patient Phil Grace is being forced to pay £450 a month for a drug which helps him stand and walk. The treatment is prescribed free of charge on the NHS in other parts of the country. Mr Grace, who lives in Great Tey, Essex, was diagnosed with MS in 2000 after suffering symptoms since his mid-20s. Constant muscle spasms left the 59-year-old unable to sleep at night and relying on a stick to walk. But his life was transformed when he found a drug on the internet, used by other MS sufferers. Phil Grace, 59, from Great Tey in Essex said he has been forced to spend £450-a-month on a cannabis-based drug that helps him walk and stand up after his local Clinical Commissioning Group refused to fund the treatment despite it being available in other parts of the UK free of charge . The cannabis-based drug Sativex controls Mr Grace's muscle spasms, enabling him to walk. He asked his GP if he could be prescribed the drug but was devastated when the Clinical Commissioning Group (CCG), which commissions care for the area, refused to fund it. Mr Grace said his only option is to pay £450 a month for 11 daily doses of the drug. He said: 'It is free in some areas and you can get it willy nilly in Wales but my local authority say it is not value for money. 'It is absolutely ludicrous really, they have never looked at the bigger picture.' A spokesman for the Mid-Essex Clinical Commissioning Group, who denied Mr Grace's funding application, said they may consider handing out Sativex if it is recommended by Nice. He said: 'Nice is currently reviewing its guidelines for the management of multiple sclerosis and is including Sativex in the scope of the consultation. 'The guidelines are due for publication in October after which the CCG will consider any recommendations. 'We do not routinely fund Sativex however patients have the right to be considered for exceptional funding if their GP or consultant feels they meet the criteria. 'A referral can be made to the CCG's exceptional case panel with clinical evidence to support the request.'","Beth Prout was diagnosed with cancer of the stomach lining .

"Dramatic new footage has emerged from the aftermath of the Kenyan shopping mall massacre of terrified survivors being rescued from a butcher's freezer bolt hole where they were hiding. The group of men locked themselves inside the walk-in fridge in the supermarket of Nairobi's Westgate Mall when a gang of armed Islamic terrorists stormed the building and opened fire. For what must have felt like an eternity of whizzing bullets and the . screams of terrorists and victims alike, the three men cowered in the freezing icebox for hours as the atrocity unfolded outside. It comes as Somali Islamist group al . Shabaab suggested the bloodbath, and its subsequent four-day siege, . would be followed by other attacks by its 'warriors'. Scroll down for video. Rescue: Their hands held above their heads, three men emerge from the butcher's freezer after being rescued by Kenyan special forces . Relief: Fear etched across his face, the first to emerge from the giant cooler then turns to the others and says, 'police, police', to reassure them . The video was filmed by civilian security guards who went to the site to help. 'We are civilians,' the guards can be heard saying. 'Put your hands up, put your hands up.' Fear etched across his face, the first to emerge from the giant cooler then turns to . the others and says, 'police, police', to reassure them. Another person can then be heard saying, 'it's ok', as all three men walk out to safety with their hands above their heads. Morgue officials in Nairobi still expect a . large influx of bodies still in the mall. Officials have told AP that . the shopping center, which the terrorists held for four days, could hold . dozens more bodies. The government has confirmed 72 total deaths: 61 . civilians, six security forces and five attackers. The Red Cross says 71 . people remain missing. And today al Shabaab issued a new, chilling statement through Twitter after it taunted Kenya during the mall raid when its militants were still holding out. 'The mesmeric performance by the #WestgateWarriors was undoubtedly gripping, but despair not folks, that was just the premiere of Act 1.' Relief: For what must have felt like an eternity of whizzing bullets and the screams of terrorists and victims alike, the three men cowered in the freezing icebox for hours as at least 67 fellow shoppers were murdered around them . Safe haven: The group of men locked themselves inside the walk-in fridge in Westgate Mall's supermarket, in Nairobi, when a gang of armed terrorists stormed the building and opened fire . Kenyan authorities are holding eight people in connection with the attack and have released three others, the interior minister said on Friday. A top Kenyan military official played down reports of a build up of Kenyan forces near the Somali border, saying that troops who had gathered near Somalia were rotating to join African peacekeepers there and replace other Kenyan soldiers. Al Shabaab said it launched the attack to demand that Kenya withdraw its troops from Somalia, where Kenyan forces deployed in 2011 to strike at the group which Nairobi blamed for attacks and kidnappings in Kenya's northern area and coastline. President Uhuru Kenyatta has said Kenya will not withdraw. Today's video is one of a number of dramatic scenes caught on camera during and after the attack that left at least 71 people dead. Earlier today, the identity of a man who selflessly saved a mother and her three daughters from the Nairobi shopping mall as gunmen threw grenades and sprayed bullets yards away was revealed. Their story: Portia Walton runs for the safety of Kenya mall hero Abdul Haji. The Waltons have now shared their harrowing tale, giving backstory to this now-iconic photo . Hero: Haji became a hero when he helped the Waltons and many others escape the mall after terrorists struck . Carnage: A soldier takes a shooting position inside of the Westgate shopping mall after the shootout. Kenyan authorities have arrested eight people so far . Somali Muslim Abdul Haji was hailed a hero after a now-iconic photograph of him reaching out to Katherine Walton's four-year-old daughter Portia as she runs away with fear etched on her face was published around the world. Mrs Walton . feared she and her children would not get out alive after becoming . trapped under a table outside a supermarket in the Westgate complex. But . they were saved by Mr Haji, the son of a former Kenyan security . minister, who bravely ushered them to safety as he fired back at the . terrorists with a handgun. Speaking of her terrifying ordeal, she told the Daily Telegraph: 'We were just going to meet my two older boys in the supermarket when we heard an explosion,' said Walton, 38, who moved to Kenya from North Carolina two years ago. Chilling new threat: Al Shabaab issued a new threat on Twitter today hailing 'the mesmeric performance by the #WestgateWarriors' and promised that this was 'just the premiere of Act 1' ‘I grabbed the girls and started . running. A woman pulled us behind a promotional table opposite. I could . see the bullets hitting above the shops and hear the screaming all . around us.' When they were . too afraid to move as group, it was four-year-old Portia who emerged . from under the table and became part of the unforgettable image captured . during the Kenya mall siege. The . girl is seen running toward Haji, whose hand is outstretched. Behind . her, Walton and the others can just barely be made out crouching beneath . an Asus promotional table. ‘I don't know how she knew to do it but she did,’ Walton told the Telegraph. ‘She did what she was told and she went. 'I think I owe Mr . Haji a hug or two.' Al-Shabab said the Kenyan government assault team carried out 'a demolition' of the building, burying 137 hostages in the debris. A government spokesman denied the claim and said Kenyan forces were clearing all rooms Wednesday, firing as they moved and encountering no one. Men were said to have been castrated and had fingers removed with pliers before being blinded and hanged during the four day siege . Pictured is the aftermath at Westgate Shopping Mall where the roof of the car park collapsed crushing three floors . The al-Shabab claim appeared to refer to the rocket-propelled grenades fired inside the Nakumatt department store, in the incident described to AP by a government official. In a series of tweets from a Twitter account believed to be genuine, al-Shabab also said that 'having failed to defeat the mujahideen inside the mall, the Kenyan govt disseminated chemical gases to end the siege.' Kenyan government spokesman Manoah Esipisu told AP that no chemical weapons were used — including tear gas — and that the collapse of floors in the mall was caused by a fire set by the terrorists. 'Al-Shabab is known for wild allegations and there is absolutely no truth to what they're saying,' he said. But officials said the death count will likely rise.","Three men locked themselves in the walk-in freezer in mall's supermarket .

"Doctors may soon be able to diagnose ADHD in children with a simple brain scan. The breakthrough was made after scientists found the brains of children and teenagers with the condition develop more slowly than other youngsters of the same age. This means the connections between and within key brain networks are less developed - and may explain common characteristics of the condition, such as struggling to focus. U.S. researchers analysed brain scans of 323 children with and without ADHD and found that key connections in the brains of those with the disorder developed more slowly than those without it. In the future, brain scan could help diagnose the condition, they said . Brain networks are a cluster of pathways  that form in the brain as it develops. Different pathways will control different processes - such as analysing an image, or accessing a memory. Different brain networks connect with others for the brain to perform a function. For example, when we look at a picture, one pathway in our brain will be processing taking in the colours and shapes, and another pathway might be recalling memories associated with them. Researchers found that the brains of children with ADHD showed less mature connections between a brain network that controls internal thoughts - such as daydreaming - and brain networks that allow a person to focus on external tasks. This lag may help explain why people with ADHD get easily distracted or struggle to stay focused, researchers said. Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a group of behavioural symptoms that include inattentiveness, hyperactivity and impulsiveness. Common symptoms of ADHD include: . ADHD can occur in people of any intellectual ability, although it is more common in people with learning difficulties. People with ADHD may also have additional problems, such as sleep and anxiety disorders. Symptoms of ADHD tend to be first noticed at an early age, and may become more noticeable when a child's circumstances change, such as when they start school. Most cases are diagnosed in children between the ages of 6 and 12. The symptoms of ADHD usually improve with age, but many adults who are diagnosed with the condition at a young age will continue to experience problems. Source: NHS Choices . And the new findings may one day allow doctors to use brain scans to diagnose ADHD, and track how well patients respond to treatment. At the moment, ADHD in children is diagnosed when a GP who has talked through the symptoms with the child's parents decides it is appropriate to refer them to a specialist - such as a paediatrician or psychiatrist - for a formal assessment. The assessment would be based on a discussion or an observation of the child's symptoms. A diagnosis based on a 'biomarker' - defined as a measureable indication of a condition - doesn't yet exist for ADHD, or any other psychiatric condition. Around three to seven per cent of children, or 400,000, are believed to have ADHD in the UK, with many being prescribed drugs to try and improve their concentration at school. The study used computing techniques to analyse a pool of brain scans that were publicly shared for scientists to study. The team looked at the brain scans of 275 children and teenagers with ADHD and 48 others without it. They used 'connectomic' methods that can map the connections between networks in the brain. The researchers found lags in the development of connections within the internally-focused network, called the 'default mode network'  and the devlopement of connections between this and networks which process externally-focused tasks, called 'task-positive networks'. The findings could help further research looking into how ADHD develops from childhood into adulthood. Some children or teenagers grow out of the disorder, while others have ADHD throughout adulthood. Indeed, studying the way that brain networks mature in ADHD could help experts find out why some children grow out of ADHD, said Dr Chandra Sripada, from Michigan University Medical School's Department of Psychiatry. The findings could help understand other disorders that are caused in differences in the connections in the brain, including autism and schizophrenia . He said: 'We and others are interested in understanding the neural mechanisms of ADHD in hopes that we can contribute to better diagnosis and treatment. 'But without the database of MRI images, and the spirit of collaboration that allowed them to be compiled and shared, we would never have reached this point. 'It is particularly noteworthy that the networks we found to have lagging maturation in ADHD are linked to the very behaviours that are the symptoms of ADHD.' He added: 'The results of this study set the stage for the next phase of this research, which is to examine individual components of the networks that have the maturational lag.' He said that 'connectomics' could be used to examine other disorders that are caused in differences in the connections in the brain, including autism and schizophrenia. The study was published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, .","Test would be the first using a brain scan to diagnose this type of condition .

In particular, the connections within and between key 'brain networks' mature more slowly in children with the condition .

"A Japanese court has ordered the release of the world’s longest serving death row inmate because the evidence used against him was likely made up. Iwao Hakamada, 78, a former professional boxer convicted of the 1966 murder of a family, has spent the last 45 years behind bars on death row, a Guinness World Record – including 30 years in solitary confinement waiting to die. The court ordered a retrial for Mr Hakamada - who was sentenced to death in 1968 but not executed because of a lengthy appeals process - although the prosecution has four days to decide whether it will appeal the decision. According to local media, Mr Hakamada was released from Tokyo Detention House for the first time in decades at around 5pm today, Japanese time. Accompanied by his sister, Mr Hakamada, in a yellow shirt, made his way slowly out of the court to a car before being driven away. A Japanese court has ordered the release of Iwao Hakamada, the world's longest serving death row inmate who has spent nearly 50 years behind bars, because evidence against him was likely to have been made up . The court ordered a retrial for Mr Hakamada, a former professional boxer, who was sentenced to death in 1968 . Presiding judge Hiroaki Murayama said he was concerned that investigators could have planted evidence to win a conviction as they sought to bring closure to a crime that had shocked the country. ‘There is possibility that (key pieces of) evidence have been fabricated by investigative bodies,’ Mr Murayama said in his ruling, according to Jiji Press. The court said today that DNA analysis obtained by Mr Hakamada's lawyers suggested that investigators had fabricated evidence. Blood stains detected on five pieces of clothing, which investigators said were worn by the culprit during the crime, did not match the DNA of Hakamada, and trousers that prosecutors submitted as evidence were too small for Hakamada and did not fit when he tried them on. Shizuoka District deputy chief prosecutor Takashi Nishitani said the ruling was unanticipated and that prosecutors would discuss whether to appeal to a higher court. It took 27 years for the Supreme Court to deny his first appeal for a retrial. He filed a second appeal in 2008, and the court finally ruled in his favour today. There has long been speculation he was innocent, and in 2007 one of the three judges who originally convicted him publicly declared he had thought Mr Hakamada was innocent. Mr Hakamada initially denied accusations that he robbed and killed his boss, the man's wife and their two children before setting their house ablaze. But the former boxer, who worked for a bean-paste maker, later confessed following what he subsequently claimed was a brutal police interrogation that included beatings. He retracted his confession, but to no avail, and the supreme court confirmed his death sentence in 1980. Mr Hakamada was released from Tokyo Detention House (pictured) for the first time in decades today . This photograph shows Mr Hakamada in a car being driven away from Tokyo Detention House . Prosecutors and courts had used blood-stained clothes, which emerged a year after the crime and his arrest, as key evidence to convict Mr Hakamada. The clothes did not fit him, his supporters said. The blood stains appeared too vivid for evidence that was discovered a year after the crime. Later DNA tests found no link between Mr Hakamada, the clothes and the blood stains, his supporters said. But the now-frail Mr Hakamada has remained in solitary confinement on death row, regardless. His supporters and some lawyers, including the Japan Federation of Bar Associations, have loudly voiced their doubts about the evidence, the police investigations and the judicial logic that led to the conviction. Even one of the judges who originally sentenced Mr Hakamada to death in 1968 has said he was never convinced of the man's guilt but could not sway his judicial colleagues who out-voted him. Japan has a conviction rate of around 99 per cent and claims of heavy-handed police interrogations persist under a long-held belief that a confession is the gold standard of guilt. Waiting to die: Iwao Hakamada has spent 30 years in solitary confinement during his time behind bars . The man (whose sister, Hideko Hakamada, is pictured, centre) was sentenced to death in 1968 . The decision to grant Mr Hakamada a retrial came as Amnesty International issued its annual review of reported executions worldwide, which showed Japan killed eight inmates in 2013, the ninth-largest national tally in the world. Amnesty, which has championed Mr Hakamada's cause and says he is the world's longest-serving death row detainee, called on prosecutors to respect the court's decision. ‘It would be most callous and unfair of prosecutors to appeal the court's decision,’ said Roseann Rife, the organisation's East Asia research director. ‘Time is running out for Hakamada to receive the fair trial he was denied more than four decades ago,’ she said. Amnesty is urging prosecutors to accept the court's decision. Roseann Rife, East Asia Research Director at Amnesty International, said: ‘The Japanese authorities should be ashamed of the barbaric treatment Hakamada has received. ‘For more than 45 years he has lived under the constant fear of execution, never knowing from one day to the next if he is going to be put to death. This adds psychological torture to an already cruel and inhumane punishment. ‘It would be most callous and unfair of prosecutors to appeal the court’s decision. Time is running out for Hakamada to receive the fair trial he was denied more than four decades ago. 'If ever there was a case that merits a retrial, this is it.  Hakamada was convicted on the basis of a forced confession and there remain unanswered questions over recent DNA evidence.’ Hideko Hakamada (left) is pictured here at a press conference after the order for a retrial of her brother . In an interview last year, Hideko Hakamada, who has spent decades speaking out on behalf of her brother's plight, said she was worried about the mental state of Mr Hakamada, who now 'talks nonsense' Mr Hakamada's sister, Hideko, 81, who . has passionately campaigned for a retrial for decades, thanked dozens of . supporters who gathered in front of the court house. ‘I want to free him as soon as possible,’ she told a press conference held shortly after the court announced its decision. ‘I want to tell him, ""You did well. You will finally be free"",’ she said. Mr . Hakamada seems to have developed psychological illnesses after decades . in solitary confinement, Hideko told AFP in an interview last year. ‘What . I am worried about most is Iwao's health. If you put someone in jail . for 47 years, it's too much to expect them to stay sane,’ his sister . said in the interview. Thursday's ruling underscores Japan's much-criticised closed interrogations, which rely heavily on self-confession. Mr Hakamada had confessed in a closed interrogation. Mr Hakamada was convicted of killing a company manager and his family and setting fire to their central Japan home, where he was a live-in employee. Apart from the United States, Japan is the only major industrialised democracy to carry out capital punishment, a practice that has led to repeated protests from European governments and human rights groups. Japan carries out a handful of . executions every year. The country has around 130 death-row inmates, who are usually . confined to their cell with little or no contact with other inmates. Prisoners . are typically notified about their impending deaths just hours before . they are hanged, and their families are told only after the execution. The only crimes that can lead to a death sentence in Japan are murder and treason. Between 1946 and 2003, 766 people were sentenced to death in Japan, according to Hoover. Of these, 608 were executed. According to Amnesty International, a number of prisoners on death row in Japan have, like Mr Hakamada, been driven to mental illness. The charity revealed in 2009 that prisoners are kept in isolation cells and are forced to sit at all time. Prisoners are generally kept in solitary confinement, televisions are banned and visits are limited and often denied.

"If Louis van Gaal had sat down with that clipboard of his and sketched out the perfect scenario for his new-look Manchester United, he could not have planned it any better than Sunday’s win over QPR. A spectacular Old Trafford introduction for record £60million signing Angel di Maria, Ander Herrera’s first goal in a United shirt and hugely impressive debuts from Daley Blind and Marcos Rojo meant that Van Gaal had the luxury of sending on Radamel Falcao with his team 4-0 up and in cruise control. The surge of optimism around Old Trafford was palpable. After the slide into mediocrity under David Moyes and a worryingly slow start to Van Gaal’s reign, here was evidence of a complete transformation. Angel di Maria celebrates scoring his first goal for Manchester United on his home debut against QPR . Robin van Persie (left) holds his hands aloft in frustration against QPR after failing to find the net once more . Juan Mata unleashes an unstoppable shot past Robert Green in the QPR goal to score United's fourth . Ander Herrera is understandably delighted after scoring his first Manchester United goal to put them 1-0 up . Daley Blind (left) and Marcos Rojo (right) were impressive during their United debuts against QPR . If there is one problem for the Dutchman, and it has become a recurring theme in recent weeks, it is how he accommodates his Gaal-acticos. The man who appeared to be most under threat in the new order was Juan Mata. Many people saw the £37m signing of the Spaniard in January as a panic buy. Some still do. Certainly the way he was shunted around the pitch under Moyes suggested that little forethought had gone into the move. Ryan Giggs dropped Mata for his first game in temporary charge at the end of last season and Van Gaal was certainly under no obligation to find room for the former Chelsea man when he took over. With the new manager looking to inject more pace into the team, it was suggested that Mata might actually slow United down. Four games into the new season, and it would appear that he has an integral role to play at No 10. Mata’s goal against QPR on Sunday was his eighth in the last 10 Premier League games, quite some record for a player who is essentially out there to provide assists. The way he linked up with Di Maria, Herrera and Blind at the top of the midfield diamond was central to United’s game plan, and may continue to be so even when Michael Carrick and Marouane Fellaini return from injury to give the manager an even bigger selection quandary. Mata runs off with his first pumped in celebration after netting United's fourth and final goal against QPR . Mata's form - he has scored eight goals in 10 Premier League games - puts Van Persie's place under threat . Juan Mata - Eight goals in last 10 Premier League matches . Robin van Persie - Two goals in last 10 Premier League matches . So who will be the odd man out among United’s big names? On current form, the player most under threat would appear to be Robin van Persie. Amid the wave of euphoria on Sunday, it was overlooked that the Dutchman did not actually play very well. In fact, he has not played particularly well for United for some time. The man credited with tipping the title balance in United’s favour after he arrived from Arsenal two years ago, faded under Moyes last season. The highlight, a Champions League hat-trick against Olympiacos, was followed by news that he would miss six weeks with a knee injury. It was not enough to prevent Van Persie from playing for Van Gaal at the World Cup and scoring that spectacular diving header against Spain in the opening game, but earlier this month he was forced to deny rumours that he will need surgery to cure his knee after United moved to sign Falcao. You can like our Manchester United Facebook page here . Louis van Gaal has a big decision to make as to whether he should keep Van Persie in his starting XI . Radamel Falcao (right) came off the bench to make his debut against QPR and could replace Van Persie (left) Wayne Rooney fires home emphatically to put Manchester United 3-0 up against QPR before half-time . Certainly his form in the early part of the new season has failed to dispel concerns that he is still struggling with the problem. On Sunday, Van Persie posed very little threat apart from one moment in the second half when he was played in by a quite wonderful flick from Di Maria. He chose to hit it first time rather than take the ball down and beat Rob Green, and normally you would have backed him to bury it. Instead he snatched at it and fired straight at the QPR keeper. It was only one moment, but it seemed to sum up Van Persie at present. When Van Gaal was confirmed as United’s new manager in May, it was assumed that his fellow Dutchman would be an automatic choice for a first-team place - if not the captaincy as well. That honour went to Wayne Rooney, of course, and now Van Persie finds himself in serious danger of being squeezed out of the line-up altogether. When Falcao is fully fit and ready to start, something will have to give. Rooney could drop into midfield in place of Mata, or Van Gaal could switch his formation again. That is unlikely, however, and Van Persie has every reason to be worried . Former United defender Rio Ferdinand (right) competes with Van Persie during the match with QPR .

"A number of European countries have already contacted FIFA about possible training bases for the 2018 World Cup, despite it being under two months since the 2014 final. And this ultra-forward planning comes at a time when European Union diplomats are supporting a boycott of the tournament in Russia as an effective protest from the West over Vladimir Putin’s military stance over Ukraine. David Cameron is also said to back the recommendations to suspend Russia from high profile sporting events, including the World Cup, in an options paper being circulated around the European capitals.

And Russia’s planning for the event, unlike the chaotic build-up to Brazil 2014 and the continuing concern over Qatar 2022, is already well advanced. This includes laying on extra flights to the more remote World Cup venues. The qualifying draw will take place in St Petersburg next July.
