A woman with narcolepsy who suffers up to six sleep attacks a day has had her life transformed by a very special dog. Annick, 35, from Belgium, never knows when she will drop off. She slept up to 16 hours a day and needed careful supervision from her parents. But she has been given a new lease of life thanks to the arrival of a little white dog called Idefix. The five-year-old mixed-breed dog is trained to wake her by nipping her ankles or ears at train and bus stops or when he hears an alarm.

'She is now able to move around the city, meet friends, arrive at appointments on time, cook and go for walks.' It is one of the first times a dog has ever been trained as an assistance dog for someone with a sleep disorder. However, . the road to creating a successful pairing was not a smooth one.

'He had a slightly peculiar character,' Dr Le Bon said. 'He was rather isolated from the other dogs and was quite stubborn.' Narcolepsy is a chronic neurological condition producing disruption to the normal sleep pattern. This produces excessive daytime sleepiness that can prove impossible to resist.They may therefore nap during normal activities such as eating and talking. It affects around one in 4,000 people and usually develops during adolescence. The precise cause is unknown though the neurotransmitter orexin is thought to be involved. There is no known cure. Scheduled naps and exercise can help ease symptoms. Stimulants can be prescribed but have significant side-effects. Further information from the NHS here .

Over the course of a year he learnt to wake up Annick on . hearing an alarm clock in the morning, even if this required half an . hour of gentle biting. The five-year-old dog was then . trained to wake his owner up when he heard her mobile phone ring or when . a timer went off. Finally he learnt to wake her  at the next bus, metro or tram stop if she had nodded off on public transport. Annick's new canine companion has given her the independence she has long craved for. She said: 'I had been handicapped by my condition for many years and now I feel like I have been given a second life.' Meanwhile Dr Le Bon hopes more dogs will be trained to help narcoleptic patients who don't respond to medication.

He may be the infamous founder of Italian fascism who allied with Adolf Hitler, tore up democracy and introduced a string of anti-Semitic laws to Italy. But it seems former dictator Benito Mussolini is still lauded in the country almost 70 years after he was shot, strung up by piano wire and his body spat upon by passers by. Many Italians are marking the dawn of a new year by adorning their walls with calendars featuring pictures of Il Duce. Resurgence: Former Italian dictator Benito Mussolini, pictured left in 1940, is still lauded by many with sales of calendars featuring his image said to be selling in higher numbers than a decade ago . And while calendars featuring Mussolini are nothing new - they go on sale alongside ones featuring sports stars and animals every year - worryingly sales are on the up according to one of the firms that makes them, with many young Italians starting to idolise the dictator once again. Renato Circi, head of Rome printer Gamma 3000, told The Guardian that his company are selling more Mussolini calendars than they were a decade ago. He said: 'I didn't think it was still a phenomenon, but young people are buying them now too.' The re-emergence of Mussolini ideology seems to have made something of a resurgence in Italy. Fascism has long left its mark on the country, with groups of so-called Ultras sporting extreme views that hark back to 1920s Italy taking to the nation's football terraces for several decades. But the cult-figure appears to have slipped back into mainstream public consciousness. He is venerated by neo-fascist youths who stormed Rome high schools back in October clutching neo-fascist flags and launching smoke bombs into classrooms while lessons were going on. Popular: Calendars of the Italian dictator are nothing new - pictured are calendars from this year and last - but sales are said to be on the increase by manufacturer Gamma 3000 . The capital has been rocked by an increase in extreme right militancy since the autumn with neo-fascist youth group Blocco Studentesco holding weekly demonstrations in Rome that have often ended in violent clashes with police. And in November, an attack on Tottenham Hotspur fans, who had travelled to Rome for a Europa League match against Serie A giants Lazio, was linked to neo-facist fans. A 25-year-old Spurs fan, Ashley Mills, was stabbed in that incident. Earlier in 2012, a village south of Rome paid tribute to Field Marshal Rodolfo Graziani by splashing out £100,000 on a statue of the infamous general. A leading businessman also mooted the idea of renaming Forli airport in northern Italy as Mussolini Airport. Idolised: Fascist ideology has been adopted by extreme football fans known as Ultras for decades, but Mussolini's views seem to be re-emerging in mainstream consciousness . Not only is the re-emergence of fascist ideas attributed partly to Silvio Berlusconi who brought post-fascist conservatives into his coalition government in 1994 and 2001. But while Germany sought to distance itself from Fascism following the fall of the Nazis in 1945, Italy has never fully endorsed powers that outlaw the existence of fascist parties drawn up in 1952. Partly because it posed a risk to the italian constitution and partly because of a 'sneaking admiration' for fascist ideology, according to James Walston, politics professor at the American University of Rome. His resurgence as an idol among some Italians is also said to be the result of the recession, which has hit Italy particularly hard. The country is in the grip of its fourth recession in a decade and its economy has barely grown in that period. Italy's national debt is among the largest in Europe. And it is thought that many young Italians are increasingly looking to right wing groups and ideologies in the hope that a strong leader may emerge and improve the nation's fortunes. Of course Italy was in financial dire straits following the First World War and Mussolini's economic fascism saw the economy grow more than 20 per cent in four years at the start of the 1920s and unemployment fall by almost 80 per cent. Italian neo-fascist group CasaPound's vice-president Simone di Stefano told The Guardian: 'Whoever buys the (Mussolini) calendar admires his work - the two things cannot be separated. 'There is a need today for his politics, for someone who will put the banks and finance at the service of italy.' Benito Mussolini pictured giving a fascist salute . Benito Amilcare Andrea Mussolini was born in Predappio, northern central Italy, in July 1883. The son of a blacksmith, he moved to Switzerland in 1902 because jobs were scarce in his home region and became involved with socialist politics there. He moved back to Italy two years later and began work as a journalist on socialist papers. Mussolini later broke from socialist ideologies when Italy decided to enter World War One and he was enlisted in the army in 1915. He formed the Fascist Party following the war in 1919 and capitalised on the support of unemployed veterans organising supporters into squads known as the Black Shirts who terrorised anyone who disagreed with their politics. As Italy fell into political chaos in the autumn of 1922, Mussolini's Black Shirts marched on Rome and he was invited to form a government. He made himself dictator in 1925 and gave himself the nickname Il Duce, setting about re-establishing Italy as a major European power. Mussolini supported General Franco in the Spanish Civil War and became involved in an increasingly strong alliance with Adolf Hitler's Germany. His declaration of war on Britain and France in June 1940 exposed Italian military weakness and was followed by a series of defeats in North and East Africa and the Balkans. In July 1943, Allied troops landed in Sicily. Mussolini was overthrown and imprisoned by his former colleagues in the Fascist government. In September, Italy signed an armistice with the Allies. The German army began the occupation of Italy and Mussolini was rescued by German commandos. He was installed as the leader of a new government, but had little power. He was eventually killed in April 1945 by partisan Italians as the Allies moved north through Italy.","Calendar sales have increased over the past decade .

Lawsuit: Associated Investigative Services claims Zimmerman failed to pay more than $27,000 for protection services . A security company has filed a lawsuit against George Zimmerman, his wife and attorney claiming that they owe more than $27,000 for protection services. Associated Investigative Services filed the lawsuit in Orange County Circuit Court on Friday against Zimmerman, who is awaiting trial on second-degree murder charges in relation to the shooting of Florida teenager Trayvon Martin. The civil complaint, which is also against his wife and attorney Mark O'Mara, claims O'Mara hired the company in June to provide security for the Zimmerman family but promised payments stopped after an independent trustee took over Zimmerman's defence fund. The company provided a detail for Zimmerman's second bond hearing on June 29, according to the complaint, and the arrangement stepped up into 'nearly constant' watch on Zimmerman's family. But AIS alleges payments stopped soon after an independent trustee took over the defence fund, the Orlando Sentinel has reported. The company says O'Mara told Zimmerman and the trustee wanted to 'clamp down' on the defence fund because it was running low. The lawsuit alleges breach of contract, among other claims, and requests a monetary judgment of $27,027.08. O'Mara told the Orlando Sentinel he was surprised the suit had been filed.He said 'We've paid them over $40,000' He said the company no longer provided protection to George and Shellie Zimmerman, partly because at one point it was billing them $7,000 per week, whereas they are now paying $700 a week for protection. The AIS complaint acknowledges the $40,000 paid and also says the company warned O'Mara the amount of security he requested was 'excessive'. Zimmerman is awaiting trial on second-degree murder charges in the shooting of Trayvon Martin. Zimmerman contends the unarmed teenager attacked him and is claiming self-defense in the February killing. Zimmerman is free on $1 million bail and is in hiding. Orlando Sentinel website .

Christmas is one of the busiest times of year for supermarkets, however the seasonal rush may have failed to deliver grocery giant Morrisons the boost in sales the company had hoped for. An update for the six weeks to the end of December, released tomorrow, is likely to show like-for-like sales fell by more than 2% on a year ago for the chain, as the UK's fourth biggest grocer is squeezed by bigger rivals and discounters such as Aldi and Lidl. The latest figure will fuel expectations that the chain's under-pressure chief executive Dalton Philips will be forced to downgrade profit hopes. Under pressure: Morrisons chief executive Dalton Philips may be forced to downgrade the company's profit hopes . Analysts believe Morrisons is struggling to compete because of its lack of grocery delivery service and limited number of convenience stores. Competition in the sector over the Christmas period has been as fierce as ever, with the big players focused on promotional deals and money-off coupons. Tesco sharpened its performance after a disastrous 2011 and is likely to show a modest return to like-for-like sales growth later this week, while Sainsbury's will also be up by about 1% in sales figures on Wednesday. The most recent set of figures from Morrisons in November showed like-for-like sales, excluding VAT and fuel, were down 2.1% after the Bradford-based firm admitted it had not done enough to advertise its promotions. Competition: The new figures are expected to show a 2% drop in sales compared to last Christmas . Despite a pledge to step up discounting and tactics to draw in hard-up shoppers - including a Christmas meal with all the trimmings from £2.49 per person - Morrisons is again seen reporting sales down by around 2%. Broker Jefferies is even more pessimistic, believing same-store sales fell by as much as 2.8% as discounters such as Aldi and Lidl attract more business. Mr Philips has led a major push to promote the chain's fresh food credentials, announcing an advertising deal with TV presenters Ant & Dec and sponsorship of hit shows Britain's Got Talent and Ant & Dec's Saturday Night Takeaway. He is expected to signal a move into online shopping later this year, while the company hopes to have 70 convenience stores by the end of 2013.","Update expected to show December sales fell by more than 2% .

In the 1950s a Dinky Toy craze hit the UK with childrern and adults wanting replicas of their favourite cars. Most of the models were in a scale of approximately 1:48 (but ranged from 1:8 to 1:2000*), which blended in with O scale railway sets. Larger models (Dinky Super Toys) were not scaled down, and started to come with more action features. In 1954, the Dinky line was reorganized: cars were sold in individual boxes and a separate line of models were made abroad. Both English and French Dinky Toys were exported to the United States. As a result of stiff competition and a change in the way children played English Dinky started to experience problems in the 1970s before closing and later becoming part of Matchbox International. The collection covers contemporary to tinplate manufacturers including Dinky, Corgi, Matchbox, Autoart and some of the more unusual like Tekno, Solido, Nicky and Norevover.

Former home secretary Jacqui Smith believes voters blame Labour for the current deficit . Labour risks being seen as the party of 'scroungers' by opposing a squeeze on benefits, according to former home secretary Jacqui Smith. Railing against her party's position on welfare, the former minister said party activists were being told on the doorstep that Labour was lacking ideas to cut the deficit. Ed Miliband has ordered his party to vote against freezing rises in benefit payments to 1 per cent for the next three years in the Commons tomorrow, instead of the inflation rate which is currently 2.7 per cent. The Labour leader has argued that most of those who will be affected are in work because the cap will also apply to tax credits. He called the policy an attack on 'strivers'. But tensions within his party emerged last month when a senior Labour figure had described the policy as 'politically suicidal' and revealed a 'caucus of new Labour figures' were set against it. This is because it left the party open to charges that it sided with 'scroungers' and was 'in denial over the need to cut the benefits bill'. Yesterday Miss Smith weighed in to the debate, saying: 'Frankly you can count me into this 'caucus'. It would include a large number of people [Labour canvassers] who've knocked on doors recently and been told the problem for Labour is that they think we caused the deficit and they're not yet convinced we know how we'll solve it. 'The Tories want to paint us as a party which cares more about those unwilling to work than those struggling in work.' A number of polls showing high levels of public support for a cap have painted Labour into a corner over its opposition to a freeze which would apply across the board except for carers benefits, some disability payments and the basic state pension. The Treasury released figures yesterday showing that by opposing cuts to welfare spending, Labour would have saddled every working family with £5,000 of national debt by the next General Election. They claim all welfare savings, including the move to aggregate most benefits into a Universal Credit, the 1 per cent cap, changes to child and housing benefit and council tax, and a crackdown on fraud and error in the system will save £83billion by 2015-16. However Labour say 60 per cent of those who would be affected are in work and would be left struggling. Ahead of the vote on the Welfare Uprating Bill, David Cameron said this argument was 'very odd' as they had backed a 1 per cent pay freeze for public sector workers, who the Prime Minister said 'work hard and do absolutely vital jobs'. Prime Minister David Cameron told BBC's Andrew Marr that Labour opposition to a benefit freeze was a 'very odd argument' Mr Cameron told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show: 'The Labour party agree with the 1 per cent increase in public sector pay but they don't agree with the 1 per cent cap on welfare. It's a very odd argument to say people out of work, their incomes should be going up faster than people in work - we don't think that is right.' Tory chairman Grant Shapps admitted there were probably 'a very small number' of 'shirkers' who preferred not to work. But he said the system under Labour was 'blatently unfair' and so complex it prevented people working more hours. Liam Byrne MP, Labour's Shadow Work and Pensions Secretary, said: 'This government are handing a £107,000 tax cut to millionaires but hitting millions of soldiers, nurses, cashiers and electricians with a strivers' tax that will cost them hundreds of pounds a year.' Benefit claimants in the North of England could be paid less than those in the South to reflect the lower cost of living, if the Tories win the next election. It is one of the radical ideas for the next manifesto put forward by the influential 2020 Group of Conservatives MPs, including cabinet ministers such as Michael Gove and Justine Greening. Yesterday Ed Balls attacked the 'lies' about benefit scroungers yesterday, saying two thirds of those affects are in work, on low or middle incomes and two thirds and these are women. The shadow chancellor also backed the Government's cap on benefits of £26,000 per family to 'get a grip on the benefits bill', but that it should be higher in London, saying it could lead to homelessness if set too low. He said: 'There are people looking for work, who currently can't find work because the economy is in a bad state. These aren't the feckless, the work shy, people behind curtains whilst others go to work, these are striving people. 'And why should they see their incomes cut while our Prime Minister at the same time is cutting taxes for the richest people?'","Former home secretary rails against her party's welfare policy .

Missing: Malcolm Levesconte was last seen by regulars at the Royal Oak pub last Sunday . Regulars at a village pub where the landlord has gone missing along with £30,000 of their savings money from a thrift fund have told how they now face a miserable Christmas. Malcolm Levesconte, landlord at the Royal Oak pub in Shrewton, near Salisbury, Wiltshire, was at the centre of an international manhunt this week after allegedly making off the cash he held on behalf of his customers. The 59-year-old is listed by officers as a missing person and is last known to have boarded a ferry bound for St Malo in France at Portsmouth Harbour last Sunday. He was last seen at the village pub, which he ran since 2002, earlier the same day when he reportedly told several drinkers 'It's been nice knowing you' as he left. Mr Levesconte had collected funds from villagers wishing to save for Christmas every Friday telling them that he would pay the money into a bank account. Each investor would then be paid their share before Christmas - the money should have been paid out on Friday, but both Levesconte and the funds are missing. It is thought that the money was never paid into the bank account. Widow Natasha Dunford, 36, told the Sunday People that she can now no longer afford to buy her 11-year-old son Josh the iPad he wants for Christmas. She added that her and her son, whose father Alan died from a heart condition aged 47 five years ago, will no longer be able to spend Christmas with family in Wales. She said: 'It'll just be me and Josh this year, we might just have to get a pizza.' Also among Levesconte's alleged victims are Geraldine and John Rose who have lost out on nearly £1,000. The most any of the pub's regulars is thought to have had in the fund, which has been running for between 15 and 20 years, is £2,400. As well as his customers, Mr Levesconte is also alleged to have duped his partner Jan Handsley and former friend Chris Bolter who helped him run the thrift fund. Hard times: Widow Natasha Dunford, pictured left with son Josh 11, and Geraldine and John Rose, right, had invested money in the Royal Oak thrift fund . Mr Bolter, 57, said that that it was Levesconte's distressed partner Jan who raised the alarm that Malcolm had gone missing. Mr Levesconte, who regulars say seemed normal at the bar on the day he disappeared, is said to have left a note at the pub saying he was going to board the boat but that he wouldn't complete the journey. Mr Bolter said: 'It's not nice to have to tell people their money is gone and they're not going to get it back. 'He's a coward so I don't think he'll ever come back here.' An emergency meeting of the local parish council launched a fundraising appeal and more than £9,100 of the lost money has been recouped through events and donations. One of the victims, Lee Acton, said he and his family had paid £2,400 into the savings club and had been saving £50 a week to pay for Christmas. He said: 'I have two daughters, one of four and one nine. I don't want them to know all their Christmas money has gone and I'm trying to find ways of getting all their presents. 'I don't think they should know what's going on because I don't want to ruin their Christmas. 'I'm amazed how the whole village has come together to try and help out not only myself but everyone else in this thrift club.' A note on the pub door said that the Royal Oak will be 'Closed until further notice' yesterday. Police said that Mr Levesconte was due to return from St Malo the following day but officers do not believe he boarded the ship to return. Detectives were working with their French counterparts to trace Mr Levesconte. French police say that it is possible he arrived in the country but may have since crossed the border into another country. He was last seen at the village pub in Amesbury Road, Shrewton, Wiltshire last Sunday. On the same day, he booked tickets for and later boarded a ferry at Portsmouth bound for St Malo in France, according to police. A spokesman for Wiltshire Police said: 'At this stage, officers are treating this as a criminal investigation but also as a missing person inquiry.' Detective Sergeant Mike Standing from Salisbury CID said they would be contacting the 60 victims by letter outlining the action they need to take. Concern: Police are treating the case as a criminal investigation, but also treating Mr Levesconte, left, as a missing person. The pub will remain 'Closed until further notice' according to a handwritten sign . The landlord was last seen at the village pub in Amesbury Road, Shrewton, Wiltshire last Sunday .

Each year, 14 million tourists visit the cathedral, which holds five Masses a day during the week, and seven on Sunday. The structure took nearly 90 years to build. Last September, the largest of the nine new bells was cast at a foundry in Holland. The six-ton bell, named Marie, was cast in a blend of copper and tin using a centuries-old formula at Holland's Royal Eijsbouts Bell Foundry. After the revolution, the north tower's bells were replaced in 1856, but they will replaced again with bells made of better quality metal that will produce a clearer sound . Many of the original bells were removed during the French Revolution. It is thought the looted bells were melted down to make cannon balls . Gabriel, one of the replacement bells. The largest remaining bell, Emmanuel, has been tolled to mark the end of the First and Second Wars, the liberation of the city in 1944, and the September 11, 2001 attacks on the Twin Towers in New York . French Interior Minister Manuel Valls said the cathedral's 850th anniversary 'is moving for all who see in its towers the image of France in all its greatness' Marie will be a long-awaited replacement . for a much older bell of the same name that was removed during the . French Revolution, when insurgents took over the cathedral and removed . all of its bells except the largest one, which is called Emmanuel. It is . thought the looted bells were melted down to make cannon balls. Emmanuel has been tolled to mark the end of the First and Second Wars, the liberation of the city in 1944, and major state occasions, as well as ringing on the hour. It was also rung on September 11, 2001 after the attacks on the Twin Towers in New York. The foundry worked with the Technical University of Eindhoven to create computer software that would allow the foundry to design a bell as well as hear it. The shape of the bell determines how it sounds. The idea is to make music from the cathedral sound as it did before the French Revolution. Experts have found manuscripts indicating what note the original bell would have produced.","Many of the original bells were looted during the French Revolution .

Gabby Adler, an independent buying . agent, said: ‘In the capital, competition for the most desirable homes . is very hot indeed with properties achieving above the asking price.’ At . present, a 582sq ft one-bedroom flat in Kensington is on the market for . £1million on the Rightmove website.

"By . Niamh O'doherty . PUBLISHED: . 14:32 EST, 11 December 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 16:31 EST, 11 December 2012 . Conrad De Souza has been ordered to pay back £270,000 of the money he earned while pretending to be a qualified doctor for Lewisham . Primary Care Trust (PCT) between 2001 and 2010. He was jailed for 27 months in October last year. De Souza, 54, of Whitmore Road, in Beckenham, received more than £329,000 from the NHS in fraudulently obtained earnings, Croydon Crown Court heard on December 5. At the PCT, he was employed in highly-paid strategic roles for which it was essential to have a degree and clinical specialisms — however, he had neither. De Souza, pictured left, was asked to supply the DNA sample after medical researcher Silke Luetzelschwab, right with her daughter, became pregnant following an affair . NHS Protect anti-fraud specialist David Horsley said: 'As a result of his deception, Mr De Souza has not only served a substantial prison sentence for his crimes but has also been ordered to pay £270,000. 'The confiscation order of £270,000 should serve as a warning to anyone tempted to defraud the NHS that, wherever appropriate, NHS Protect will not only seek criminal, civil and disciplinary sanctions but will press for the recovery of any lost NHS funds.' De Souza's deception was discovered when he was caught faking a DNA sample to avoid maintenance costs for a child he had with a one-time lover. He pleaded guilty to two counts of fraud by false representation at Croydon Crown Court. At the trial, prosecutor Robert O’Sullivan said De Souza had lied about having three years’ experience at a busy practice in Beckenham. The court heard his CV 'could be . described as a work of fiction' and that he had used details of another . doctor with a similar name to get the jobs. The . Tanzanian-born British citizen had enrolled at the University of London . medical school in 1980 but never graduated. Sangita Modgil, mitigating, . said De Souza had come from a successful family and could not cope with . having failed university. Croydon Crown Court heard that De Souza, 54, had received more than £329,000 from the NHS in fraudulently obtained earnings . She said describing himself as a doctor was something of huge importance to his self-esteem. At the time a spokesman from NHS Lewisham said De Souza had never treated patients, examined them or prescribed medication to them while in his roles as clinical advisor at NHS Lewisham and as assistant clinical director for the South East London Cardiac and Stroke Network. Judge Simon Pratt described his behaviour as 'brazen' and said he had been 'deeply dishonest and wilfully manipulative.' He said: 'You were an articulate, driven and deeply dishonest man without any apparent conscience about what you were doing.' In a separate case heard at Bromley Magistrates’ Court, De Souza had pleaded guilty to a charge of fraud by false representation after falsifying a DNA sample. He was asked to supply the sample after medical researcher Silke Luetzelschwab became pregnant following an affair. De Souza refused to acknowledge fathering the child and Miss Luetzelschwab was forced to contact the Child Support Agency. The court heard he supplied the DNA of a close male relative, most likely his father’s. De Souza was later proved to be the father of Miss Luetzelschwab’s daughter, who was born in December 2009, after which the investigation began. It was also revealed that he was in fact married. Speaking after sentencing, Stuart Richards, the principle legal enforcement manager for the Child Support Agency in the south east, said De Souza had been 'living a lie'. He said: 'This was perhaps the most sophisticated attempt to cheat a mother and child out of financial support that the CSA has ever seen.'

If he is looking a bit glum, perhaps it’s because he’s just seen the forecast. This Christmas is highly unlikely to be a white one, according to meteorologists. Instead, it will bring a mixture of rain and bright spells across the country – alongside rather mild temperatures. Bad news: If he is looking a bit glum, perhaps it's because he's just seen the forecast. This Christmas is highly unlikely to be a white one, according to meteorologists . And with highs of 11C on Christmas Day, this extremely well-insulated robin may even find himself feeling slightly toasty. Martin Hicks, who snapped  the bird perched on a string of fairy lights in the garden of his home in Crawley, West Sussex, said: ‘I’ve never seen such a fat-looking robin. It just sat there staring at me.’ But while the round robin may look like he has swallowed a bauble or a few mince pies, experts said his size was probably not due to over-eating. Grahame Madge of the RSPB said: ‘They eat more in the winter as they need more energy to survive the cold. Eating more creates a fat store but it doesn’t usually make difference to their weight as they burn it off quickly. ‘They fluff up their feathers during cold weather so they  trap air close to the body to keep them warm.’ For . those of us who aren’t able to use such tactics, umbrellas and . raincoats may come in useful today instead, as persistent showers are . forecast into this evening. The South-West is set to get the worst drenching, and there is a risk of localised flooding with two-and-a-half inches of expected to fall in less than two days. Other parts of Britain have also been warned to brace themselves as successive bands of heavy rain move across the country. The Environment Agency said swathes of southern and south-western England, south-eastern Wales and the Midlands should be alert to the possibility of flooding today. Looking ahead to Christmas Day, Met . Office forecaster Dan Williams said: ‘At this early stage, it looks that . we won’t see a white Christmas for a large part of the country. Perhaps . there will be a chance of snow on highest Scottish peaks. ‘Generally, it is looking like it will be a mild day for much  of Britain, with temperatures of up to 11C.’ Travel . to the Isles of Scilly will be much harder over Christmas after Land's . End Airport announced that it will close from today until December 27 because of the severe weather. The west Cornish airport only reopened on Tuesday after closing on Friday due to a waterlogged runway. Worse is yet to come: Shoppers in Exeter, Devon, endure rain yesterday but conditions were expected to get worse overnight . It means families may have difficulty getting to and from the island to visit loved ones for Christmas. Nick . Sanders, Group Commercial Manager for the Isles of Scilly Steamship . Company, said: 'The water table at Land's End in this weather - we've . had 15mm of rain last night - takes us beyond the point of no return . because of the grass runway. Umbrella weather: Shoppers in Exeter, Devon, brave the worsening conditions to pick up Christmas gifts . Weathering the storm: A man with an umbrella braves the downpour in Cardiff as the deluge swept the country . 'Landing heavy aircraft on grass would tear up the ground, so we're now running passengers up from Land's End to Newquay, free of charge.' Plans to potentially solve the runway problem at Land's End could include hardening the whole runway or bringing in Perfo plastic meshing. Under my umbrella: Britain is set to be battered by rain with little let-up over the coming seven days . On Tuesday night, the Environment Agency issued three flood warnings for South West England and one in East Anglia. The band of heavy rain expected to . arrive in the South West early yesterday morning would exacerbate an . existing problem with standing surface water, officials said. ‘This will be followed by a band of . further rain, throughout Wednesday night into Thursday morning,’ the . agency added. ‘The outlook for the weekend is unsettled.’ A further 41 areas have been put on . flood alerts, mostly in the . South West, but also in the South East and . North East of England as well as parts of the Midlands. Emergency services in Devon and Somerset are advising motorists of the dangers of ignoring warning signs and driving through floodwater. The fire service said conditions could be similar to those experienced at the end of last month - with heavy rain falling on already saturated ground. During one 24-hour period in November alone, Devon and Somerset Fire Service attended 51 incidents involving vehicles stuck in floodwater. For days after the flooding, crews were still being called to vehicles stranded in floodwater after motorists had ignored or moved road closure signs. Fire officers are asking residents not to drive through floodwater, as they could be putting themselves or others in danger. Crews attending preventable incidents could also be diverted from other incidents where lives are at risk. Area manager Alex Hanson said: 'It is impossible for motorists to tell how deep water is or the condition of the ground beneath. 'There is a significant risk to life if motorists become stranded. 'We recommend that people do not make non-essential journeys tonight or tomorrow morning if they live in areas prone to flooding. 'If they do see floodwater on the road, they should not attempt to drive through it but should try to find an alternative route. 'And if a road has been closed, it is for the safety of the public and closure signs should be respected.' Large swathes of England and Wales . were brought to their knees last month when flood water surged through . streets and down roads. Communities were cut off and dozens of residents were forced to flee their homes, while travel became a dangerous minefield. Rivers burst their banks and fields were flooded as several days of rain fell in just a few hours. Calm moment: Sheep graze in a field as winter mist envelops the Cheshire countryside yesterday in Northwich, ahead of the deluge forecast for today . Enchanted lake: On Monday, the chances of snow in London were 5/2 but on Tuesday Ladbrokes said they were 6/1 . Warm glow: A man walks his dog, with severe weather warnings issued by the Met office and 45 flood warnings and alerts in place for Britain . Many people in 'risk' areas will now . be torn between going to see their loved ones and staying at home to . save what they can if their houses are hit by more floods. With the ground already saturated, the wet weather is likely to lead to property flooding from rivers and surface water as well as disruption to road and rail networks. The counties of Cornwall, Devon, Dorset, Hampshire, West Sussex and Northamptonshire are particularly at risk, and people are being urged to keep up to date with the latest information from the Environment Agency website, sign up to free flood warnings, check their route for disruption before travelling, and not to drive or walk through floodwater. Craig Woolhouse, flood risk manager at the Environment Agency, said: 'Our teams are out around the clock to minimise the risks and prepare for flooding, clearing drainage channels and ensuring that flood defences are working properly. 'We urge people to keep up to date with the weather forecast and local news overnight and remain prepared for flooding in their area by signing up to receive free flood warnings and staying away from dangerous flood water.' For the past three weeks, huge swathes of the Somerset Levels have remained submerged as the deluges from the November storms continue to cause misery and the forecast new rain will only add to the chaos. One family forced to rush to safety from their home after costly new flood defences in a Worcestershire village failed last month have been given a home over Christmas by the local vicar. The Crosby family had to evacuate their rented house after expensive pumps were overwhelmed and stopped working at the Kempsey flood defences. The vicar of Kempsey, the Rev Mark Badger, has taken his house in Worcester off the market and has given it to the family to stay in so they have a roof over their heads for the festive season. Drenched: The Met Office already has weather warnings for heavy rain and ferocious winds in place for today (top) and Saturday (above) Malcolm Crosby said the offer was 'very generous and really unexpected' and said it meant his family would now have 'a bit of stability before Christmas'. The Kempsey flood defence pumps were officially unveiled in July, as part of a £1.5m project that included earth embankments and a series of sluice gates. About 30 houses in the village were evacuated in the early hours of Sunday November 25th after heavy rain led to flooding. Traffic information company Inrix said around 18 million drivers could take to the road this festive season, and driving home for Christmas could take up to six times longer than usual in places - especially if the roads are icy and wet. Tyre company Michelin said those living in London would travel the furthest, motoring an average of 167 miles (269km). It added that around 7% of drivers had changed their travel plans due to the rising cost of petrol. Wash out: The Environment Agency issued three flood warnings for South West England and one in East Anglia, plus 41 flood alerts in the South of England and the Midlands . British Airways predicted its busiest day would be Friday, with the airline handling more than 100,000 passengers. Even on Christmas Day, BA will carry 27,000 people, with the busiest day after the Christmas break being January 2, when more than 91,000 passengers will fly. Top long-haul destinations for BA this Christmas are New York, Miami, Cape Town, Dubai and Hong Kong, while the top short-haul spots are Edinburgh, Geneva, Glasgow, Amsterdam and Manchester. Gatwick said around 1.5 million people would be travelling through the West Sussex airport between December 17 and January 2. Its busiest departure date is set to be Saturday, with around 56,000 festive travellers leaving. Gatwick’s top three Christmas destinations are Geneva, Edinburgh and Dubai.

Egypt's pope urged his congregation to be joyful and 'not be afraid' in his Mass for Coptic Christmas as he attempted to reassure a community anxious about the rise of Islamists to power. Pope Tawadros II's words came before the Egyptian military revealed it foiled an attempted car bombing which was likely targeting an abandoned church or a nearby military camp under construction along the Egypt-Gaza border. Tawadros also prayed for peace and stability for Egypt when he led his first Christmas Midnight Mass late on Sunday night in Cairo. Pope Tawadros II urged Copts not to be afraid during his Christmas Midnight Mass on Sunday - the same night the Egyptian military foiled an attempted car bombing which could have been targeting a church . In his first Midnight Mass, Tawardros' prayers reflected the concerns of Coptic Christians . He asked God to guide Islamist President Mohammed Morsi and his government to lead 'wisely'. On Monday Egyptian military spokesman Colonel Ahmed Mohammed Ali said security forces learned militants were preparing a car bomb late Sunday in a deserted part of the city of Rafah, which borders Gaza. Three military vehicles raided the site, forcing the suspected militants to flee, some by foot and others in an unmarked pick-up truck. They left behind a vehicle packed with explosives, bullet casings, and a rocket-propelled grenade, the spokesman said. Ali said it was not immediately clear what the militants intended to attack, but that officials suspected the target was likely an abandoned church or a military camp used by police and border guards. Egypt's Copts were celebrating Christmas today, and the potential violence against a church on the holiday is unsettling for a community already anxious about the rise of Islamists to power in Egypt following the uprising that toppled longtime leader Hosni Mubarak. Pope Tawadros II prayed for peace and stability for Egypt and asked God to guide Islamist President Mohammed Morsi and his government . Tawadros was elected in November to replace longtime Pope Shenouda III, who died in March after 40 years as leader of the ancient church. His prayers reflected the concerns of the Coptic Christians, who represent about ten per cent of Egypt's 85 million people. Many are feeling unsettled under the country's first Islamist president and a newly passed constitution that could open the way for stricter Islamic law in Egypt. Even before the rise of Islamists to power, the Christian minority had long complained of discrimination by the state and the Muslim majority. But since Egypt's uprising against authoritarian rule, the community has grown more concerned about its future as Islamist political forces, long repressed under the previous autocratic regime, grew more assertive. Pope Tawadros II was elected in November to replace longtime Pope Shenouda III, who died in March after 40 years as leader . 'Don't be afraid,' Tawadros said in his midnight sermon, selecting messages from the Bible to reassure his congregation. 'Even if humans feel lots of fear, remember God will take care of you. This is a collective message because fear is contagious... This is a message of reassurance.' Coptic Christians celebrate Christmas today according to a different calendar than Roman Catholics and Protestants use. Tawadros said: 'We pray for this beloved country, Egypt, for God to protect her safety, security, stability; to protect her unity and more so, her image. 'We don't pray for the land. We pray for the humans, all humans ... starting with the president, Mohammed Morsi, and all officials, and for God to give everyone wisdom and responsibility to manage the affairs of this country and its people in true Egyptian spirit.'

A man convicted of coldly strangling his wife and leaving her body in a Massachusetts parking lot will be the first inmate in the nation to receive sexual reassignment surgery paid for by the state, a federal judge ruled today. Robert Kosilek, who has been known as Michelle for more than a decade, has already received hormone treatments, psychotherapy and electrolysis while serving a life sentence as a woman in an all-male prison. While imprisoned, she has tried to commit suicide twice and tried to castrate herself. U.S. District Judge Mark Wolf ruled today that Kosilek, who was convicted of first degree murder in the killing of his wife Cheryl in 1990, has won the right to receive a $20,000, state-funded sex change operation because it is a 'serious medical need'. Prison officials have opposed the decision based on the safety of Kosilek, saying that her housing and security needs would be impossible to meet as she would surely be a target for assault. Scroll down for video . Victory: Robert Kosilek, who has been known as Michelle for more than a decade, has already received hormone treatments, psychotherapy and electrolysis while serving a life sentence as a woman in an all-male prison. Michelle is pictured on January 15, 1993 in Bristol County Superior Court, in New Bedford, Massachusetts . Convicted: Robert Kosilek was convicted of murder in the killing of his wife in 1990. He is pictured on May 24, 1990, being led to the county jail following his arraignment on drunken driving charges, in New Rochelle, NY . According to court documents, Kosilek began transitioning to a female after his arrest and indictment. He first launched his campaign against the Massachusetts Department of Correction 12 years ago. 'Everybody has the right to have . their health care needs met, whether they are in prison or out on the . streets,' Kosilek said last year from a state . prison in Norfolk, Mass. 'People in the prisons who have bad hearts, hips or knees have . surgery to repair those things.' She continued: 'My medical needs are no less important or more important than the person in the cell next to me.' In 2002, Wolf ruled that Kosilek was entitled to treatment for gender-identity disorder, but stopped short of ordering surgery. She was also granted electrolysis treatment and hormone therapy. Kosilek sued again in 2005, arguing that the surgery is a medical necessity. In his ruling Tuesday, Wolf found that surgery is the 'only adequate treatment' for Kosilek's 'serious medical need.' 'The court finds that there is no less intrusive means to correct the prolonged violation of Kosilek's Eighth Amendment right to adequate medical care,' Wolf wrote in his 126-page ruling. Prison officials have repeatedly cited security concerns in the case, saying that allowing her to have the surgery would make her a target for sexual assaults by other inmates. Massachusetts Correction Commissioner Kathleen Dennehy has said that if Kosilek has the surgery, the consequences would be unprecedented. 'The safety and security concerns are enormous,' Dennehy testified, according to CBS. But Wolf found that the DOC's security concerns are 'either pretextual or can be dealt with by the DOC.' He said it is up to prison officials to decide how and where to house Kosilek after the surgery. Change: Kosilek first sued the Massachusetts Department of Correction 12 years ago . Cheryl Kosilek was found dead in the back seat of her car in a shopping mall parking lot on Sunday, May 20, 1990. Markings showed she had been strangled with a rope and a wire and a taxicab driver testified in court that he had picked up Kosilek from that very mall in the afternoon and driven him home. A few hours later, Kosilek called police to report his wife missing, suggesting that she might have gotten into a car accident.

A few hours later, Kosilek called police to report his wife missing, suggesting that she might have gotten into a car accident. Police picked him up at his Mansfield home and questioned him, telling him that 'a body was found in the back seat' of Cheryl's abandoned vehicle. Kosilek said his wife was at work all day and had intended to stop by the mall afterwards and that he was busy at the couple's home all day. Timothy McCaul, Cheryl's 15-year-old son who lived with the couple, said that he called home for a ride around 5 p.m. and no one answered the phone. Kosilek was questioned again, only this time he left half way through the interview and said he was getting an attorney. Two days later, Kosilek was involved in a car crash at midnight. Officers found him in the driver's seat dressed in women's clothing and sent him home. On May 24, 1990, Kosilek was stopped for speeding in New Rochelle, New York, and arrested him for drunk driving. 'You would be drunk too if the police thought you killed your wife,' he said. Later, at the police station, the defendant stated, 'Look, I had a fifteen year old son and a wife. I can't call my wife. I murdered my wife. Now, I need to call a psychiatrist now.' He later admitted to a reporter that . he and his wife got into a heated argument during the day and she had . thrown boiling water in his face.

After he was indicted for the crime, he began the transition from male to female and legally changed his name to Michelle. Kosilek's lawsuit has become fodder for radio talk shows and lawmakers who say the state should not be forced to pay for a convicted murderer's sex-change operation – which can cost up to $20,000 – especially since many insurance companies reject the surgery as elective. Wolf noted that Kosilek's gender-identity disorder has caused Kosilek such anguish that she has tried to castrate herself and twice tried to commit suicide, including once while on Prozac. Kosilek's lead attorney, Frances Cohen, called the decision courageous and thoughtful. 'We feel very grateful that the judge listened very carefully to the medical experts and has given Michelle Kosilek what the prison doctors had recommended,' Cohen said. Inmates in Colorado, California, Idaho . and Wisconsin have sued unsuccessfully to try to get the surgery, making . similar arguments that denying it violates the U.S. Constitution's . protection against cruel and unusual punishment. 'This is not a choice. Transsexuals are born and not made,' said psychiatry professor George R. Brown at East Tennessee State University. 'If you didn't have this condition, why would you want to have your genitals removed, if not by a competent surgeon but by your own hand?' According to research by Brown, about 27,000 people nationwide have gender identity disorder. Experts estimate 500 to 750 Americans undergo the surgery each year, with hundreds more seeking the procedure abroad. Federal courts have said prisons must provide adequate medical care, and that they must protect inmates from themselves. But correctional officials and lawmakers balk at using taxpayer money for sex-change operations that can cost up to $20,000. Brown estimates that at least 750 of the more than 2 million prisoners nationwide had gender identity disorder in 2007, his latest count.

Victim: Jason Lewis, 34, was a father of three who was shot and killed at his local diner after he defended his girlfriend against a drunken suitor . After a verbal exchange between the trio, Mr Gainer, who was celebrating his birthday, allegedly slapped Jason Lewis in the face. ‘Why did you smack me? We don’t have to shed blood for this,’ was Mr Lewis’ alleged reply, to which Mr Gainer took out a .22-caliber handgun and shot him in the chest in front of shocked guests and staff. ‘He just put the gun to his heart and pulled the trigger,’ owner Hakim Abdel told New York Daily News. ‘Two seconds – it just took two seconds.’ The incident was caught on CCTV where Mr Gainer can be seen arriving from celebrating his birthday in a strip club, and approaching Mr Lewis' girlfriend, a 911 dispatcher.

An ambulance crew took forty-one minutes to reach a critically ill six week old baby because they finished their break before responding to the emergency 999 call. Thomas Passant died for four minutes after suffering a cardiac arrest and he continues to fight for his life at Birmingham Children's Hospital two weeks after he stopped breathing and started to turn blue at his home. The child has endured 14 hours of open heart surgery in 11 days since his parents' emergency call to West Midlands Ambulance Service - and now faces a potential life of disability. His grandfather, Paul Passant, a former fireman from Bridgnorth, Wolverhampton, has . now vowed to 'fight until his last breath' to improve ambulance services . so no family ever have to endure the same heartache. Six-week old Thomas Passant who suffered a heart attack over Christmas but had to wait 45 minutes for an ambulance to arrive. He is still recovering in hospital . Ambulance bosses have now confirmed that the mercy crew which responded to the family's 999 call could not be dispatched until they had finished their break. They had opted to take 'undisturbed breaks', which meant they did not show up on the operator's system at the time. Mr Passant, a 56 year-old fire risk assessor, said: 'I understand that they have got to have breaks, but, if years ago when I was a fire officer, I had sat outside someone's burning house and told them I was just going to finish my sandwich, I don't think they would have been at all pleased. 'They knew how critically ill Thomas was and how important time was. I think it's disgusting.' A spokesman for West Midlands Ambulance Service said: 'The crews work 12-hour shifts and obviously have the right to a meal break. Individual staff can request that their break is not disturbed, meaning that they will not show up as an available ambulance to send to jobs. The service is duty bound to honour that choice. 'The crew that was sent to Thomas was on an undisturbed break when the 999 call came through. As soon as it was over, they were shown as available and sent to Bridgnorth.' Mr Passant spent much of Christmas drumming up support for his Return Our Ambulance Service to Bridgnorth campaign which he said he promised Thomas he would win while his grandson was on a life support machine. He spent nine days - including Christmas Eve night - to get people to sign his petition and has collected around 2,000 signatures in just nine days. He said he does not want another family to suffer such heartache. He said: 'It is always going to be in . our minds that the damage that has been done to Thomas's heart was . caused by the hold-up of the ambulance service. 'My grandson will have a disability and he's going to miss out on so much. It is breaking our hearts. 'If we had an ambulance in Bridgnorth he could have been in hospital in half an hour. 'He wouldn't have gone into cardiac arrest, and he wouldn't have gone into respiratory arrest in the ambulance on the way over. 'I . won't stop. I promised Thomas when he was fighting for his life on a . machine that I will fight until my last breath so another family will . not have to go through what we have gone through. I feel the service . Thomas got was what you'd expect in a third world country.' 'There . are days when we don't have any paramedic cover in Bridgnorth at all. People are really angry. The support I have had from the whole town is . amazing.' Grandfather Paul Passant, from Bridgnorth, has now launched a campaign for a better ambulance service . Thomas has endured 14 hours of open heart surgery in 11 days since his parents emergency call to West Midlands Ambulance Service . Surrounded by tubes, Thomas has two injections every day to prevent another devastating blood clot from developing on his heart. Now aged eight weeks, his sports-loving family have been told that he will never be able to kick a ball around with his friends or take part in any contact sport. His parents, Kate Oram and Matthew, dialled 999 at 12.47pm on December 17 from their home in Bridgnorth, Shrosphire. The family waited for 15 minutes for help from a community paramedic, despite living just 300 yards away from the mercy base in Stourbridge Road, where the family claim 24/7 cover was promised when the town's ambulance station was closed in April. They say there was no-one working in Bridgnorth so a community paramedic had to travel from nearby Tweedale. It took until 13.28pm for an ambulance to respond to their life-saving call because it had to travel from Donnington. Thomas was initially taken to Princess Royal Hospital in Telford. Mr Passant said: 'Thomas was struggling to breathe and his breathing was really rapid. You could see his little chest going up and down, and he was going blue at the lips. 'As soon as he got into the Princess Royal Hospital he went into cardiac arrest and Kate, Matthew and my wife Christine watched for three hours as anaesthetists desperately tried to provide him with oxygen. There was blood pouring out of his mouth. It was the most awful thing to witness.' Doctors at the Telford hospital spent eight hours stabilising Thomas before he was transferred to Birmingham Children's Hospital. The next day he underwent his first six hours of open-heart surgery, and two more the day after, as doctors closed his tiny chest back up. But the family's heartache was far from over. A week after his first operation doctors discovered a leak in one of Thomas's heart valves had worsened and that the already weak baby would need to go back under the knife. 'We thought he was doing really well but then he took a turn for the worse,' Paul said. 'Two doctors were trying to get lines into him with drugs and adrenaline but they couldn't get them into his little arms or legs. The family still have a pile of unopened Christmas presents ready to open with baby Thomas . 'In the end they managed to get two canulas into his head and it was a good job because he crashed right at that moment.' Thomas was taken in for four more hours of surgery to replace his mitral valve with an artificial valve and then endured another two hours to close his chest again. He will need a further operation around the age of 12 to have the artificial valve replaced with a larger one as he grows. 'I had a little, weak smile off him the other day and it was just heartbreaking,' Mr Passant said. 'He's been through such a lot but he's a real fighter.' Mr Passant said the ambulance response time was slower than that of a vet attending his elderly mother's dog Oscar. He added: 'It's absolutely ridiculous that a vet can get to a sick dog within 15 minutes but it takes them almost an hour to get a baby to hospital.' The family have also started raising funds for Birmingham Children's Hospital and GBP450 has already been donated to their appeal from a quiz night at the Crown Hotel in Bridgnorth. A spokesman for West Midlands Ambulance Service said: 'Due to the level of demand at the time of the call, every ambulance in Shropshire was committed to a patient. 'The Community Paramedic arrived 15 minutes after the start of the call and began to treat the boy. 'Throughout all this time, the control room continued to search for an available ambulance. 'It is also important to note that at the time of the call to Stourbridge Road, an elderly woman who had suffered a stroke in Bridgnorth, was already being tended to by an ambulance crew and was taken to Princess Royal Hospital, becoming available at 1.42pm. 'There would not have been an ambulance available in Bridgnorth and an ambulance would have been called in from elsewhere to tend to the boy. The response would not have been quicker; it could even have been longer.'","Thomas Passant died for four minutes after suffering a cardiac arrest .

A health boss played an innuendo-laden game of scrabble with a newly qualified nurse as he waged a campaign of harassment, a tribunal has heard. Peter King is accused of bombarding the nurse with text messages and making lewd remarks. The senior manager of a community mental health in Swindon, Wilts, is also accused of using sexually suggestive words during a game of online Scrabble on Facebook. The senior manager pressured the nurse into adding him as a friend on Facebook then sent her saucy messages while they played Scrabble . The hearing in central London yesterday heard that in one exchange, King said: ‘You are obviously not catching on too quickly, and I’m getting bored of inferring things. 'I’ll be blunt, I think you are f********.’ The nurse was so repulsed by his approaches she reported King to Wiltshire Police who made him sign a document promising not contact her again. King, who was already on a final warning for harassing student nurses, yesterday faced a Nursing and Midwifery Council misconduct hearing, accused of waging a campaign of sexual harassment. Nurse A, whose identity has been protected during the hearing, joined his team on August 2 as she qualified as a psychiatric nurse, and immediately became the object of King’s attention, it is said. ‘Nurse A’s experiences had left her fearful, intimidated and threatened’, said Ros Stower, who investigated the complaints against King. ‘Throughout the whole time I was interviewing her, she was tearful, anxious, and very distressed.’ King allegedly text the nurse saying: 'You will see from the texts I don't chase for long, and I don't like failure. xx pity' (posed by model) Nurse A began keeping a diary of alleged approaches by King, which started on August 12 when he is accused of saying to her: ‘You mean you have been in my car before and I did not molest you?’ ‘Those are exactly the words she used and she read them out from her diary herself’, said Ms Stower. On August 18, King is alleged to have sent saucy messages through Facebook as he and nurse played a game of scrabble online. ‘There were interactions on Facebook and some chat which was flirtatious with sexual innuendo’, said Ms Stower, although she admitted there was no evidence of the online exchanges. King allegedly told nurse A she was ‘f*******’ on August 20, and sent her a series of text messages the next day out of working hours. Nurse A went off sick on August 24 with stress, but King allegedly continued to pursue her by trying to get her personal mobile phone number through her mentor. Ms Stower told the hearing King had been on his last warning at work, with sexual innuendo part of daily life in his department. ‘He was on a final written warning because of complaints raised by student nurses of sexually inappropriate comments towards them while they were on a placement with his team’, she said. ‘From the interviews it appeared his team was quite split, with Peter King held in high regard by some and others hold him in less regard. ‘The consistent message was Peter King was quite friendly with his team, and there was a lot of belief he did not consistently present in a professional manner. ‘Sexual innuendo was a long-established culture on his team.’ King was suspended from his role as manager of the community mental health team based in The Mall, Swindon, and was eventually sacked by Avon and Wiltshire Mental Health Partnership NHS Trust for serious gross misconduct in March 2011.

But the National Medical Council did not accept any admissions of guilt had been made. Nurse A told the hearing her ‘world fell apart’ as former soldier King’s advances became more aggressive and threatening. Giving evidence yesterday, the nurse said she put his comment about ‘molesting’ her in his car down to his reputation among the nursing team. ‘This was the first time Peter King made me feel uncomfortable, but he had a bit of a reputation among student nurses as being a bit of a ladies man’, she said. When she got into a game of online Scrabble with King via Facebook, he laid the eight-point word BOOB while sending her sexually charged instant messages, it is alleged. ‘I can’t be 100 per cent certain what he wrote, but I have some memory of the word boob being placed on the board’, she said. ‘I just thought he was mucking around. ‘I am absolutely sure he made sexual innuendos, he made me feel uncomfortable during one of the games, so uncomfortable I made excuses that I had to go and tend to one of my children, which wasn’t the case.’ Nurse A said King had pressured her into adding him as a friend on Facebook, and said she felt she had no choice after he asked three days in a row.

When King went out for a cigarette on August 20, just over two weeks after he hired her, and allegedly commented that the mother-of-three was ‘f*ckable’. ‘This just knocked me for six’, she said. 'I was scared, and disgusted that it had gone to a new level. ‘Prior to that, some people may have seen what he was saying as banter, but it wasn’t banter anymore. ‘I felt really disempowered as he was my boss. If another man said that to me I would respond, but I didn’t feel I could because it was him and at that point he was frightening me.’ Nurse A said the situation deteriorated rapidly at the end of the week when she received a text message from King, saying: ‘You will see from the texts I don’t chase for long, and I don’t like failure. xx pity.’ ‘That was the moment when my world fell apart’, she said. ‘I took it as a threat, and took it that he was clearly after me in a sexual way and he was angry that I didn’t want to do it. ‘He had clearly got the message that I wasn’t interested and I really felt when he said “pity” he meant pity for me as I was only two or three weeks into my job.’ Nurse A said King, who she described as having an ‘army persona’, had isolated her from other colleagues since joining the team, so she had no one to confide it. ‘It seemed like every time I tried to beat him off, as politely as possible, he kept coming back saying it’s OK I won’t tell anyone’, she added. She thought about quitting nursing, and was signed off sick with stress on August 24. After she confided in a colleague the alleged harassment was reported to a senior manager in the trust. Nurse A, who fought back tears as she gave evidence to the hearing, was eventually moved to a different mental health team within the trust. She was promoted to a band 6 nurse in September last year, and took on a new job as a specialist practitioner in April this year.

Obsessed with blades: Teenager Guriyot Singh, pictured posing with a huge sword, has been jailed for seven years after stabbing a university student repeatedly in a savage gang attack . A knife-obsessed teenager has been jailed for seven years after repeatedly stabbing a university student who was trying to defend his girlfriend during a violent gang attack. Gurjyot Singh, 17, was part of a gang of youths, some as young as just 14, when he stabbed Edward Vos five times and left him fighting for his life. A court heard how Singh, who attacked his victim with a deadly lock knife, was obsessed with blades and posed for photos found on his computer and mobile phone while brandishing a sword. Singh almost killed Mr Vos, a 19-year-old first-year undergraduate studying in Birmingham, after stabbing him in the elbow, chest and abdomen, the court heard. He posed on the internet, brandishing a sword, with a knife tucked in his belt, had a knife hanging on his bedroom wall and photographs of other blades on his phone and computer. Singh, from Rednal, Birmingham, led a gang of five teenagers, the youngest of whom was just 14 years old, who attacked Mr Vos, his girlfriend Sarah Laight and their two female friends as they walked along Birmingham's Bristol Street at 1am on April 28, last year. Ms Laight, who was about to leave university, had been celebrating handing in her final dissertation as the gang attacked her and Mr Vos and their friends on the way home. Also jailed at Birmingham Crown Court on Friday was 15-year-old Luke Timby, from Winson Green, who was sentenced to six years. A 15-year-old boy from Rednal, who cannot be named for legal reasons, was handed a two-year youth rehabilitation order, a two-year supervision order and a six-month home curfew. A 14-year-old boy, from Rubery, who also cannot be named for legal reasons, was handed a two-year youth rehabilitation order. A 16-year-old girl, from Bournville, will be sentenced in the coming weeks. Before the attack, Singh had been showing off a deadly lock knife with a three-inch blade as the gang of five drank at the 16 year-old girl's home. He even told detectives he had a knife in his shoe when they first questioned him and officers found pictures of other knives on his mobile phone and computer. During the four-week trial at Birmingham Crown Court, the jury heard how in the early hours of the previous morning the group had roamed the streets of Birmingham goading innocent passersby. Left for dead: Edward Vos, 19, and his girlfriend Sarah Laight (both pictured) were attacked by a gang of youths, some as young as 14, as they walked home in Birmingham at 1am in April last year . Deadly: Singh stabbed Mr Vos in the chest, abdomen and elbow with this lock knife . As the group of students came out of a pedestrian subway, they were followed along Bristol Street by the gang who began shouting abuse at them. The taunting quickly turned more sinister as the 16-year-old girl started telling Mr Vos how she was going to 'batter' his girlfriend before pulling her to the ground by her ponytail. While on the ground, the young attacker straddled her victim and repeatedly punched her in the face and about the body before dragging her by her hair towards passing traffic. At the same time, the four teenagers then set about her boyfriend, placing him in a 'sleeper hold'. Despite being outnumbered, the brave student managed to break free and throw the girl off Ms Laight, allowing her to run to safety. Came to her rescue: One of the gang members pulled Ms Laight towards passing traffic by her hair, but despite being outnumbered Mr Vos broke free and threw the attacker off her, allowing her to escape . Angered by his victim's actions, Timby held him from behind while Singh stabbed him five times in the elbow, chest and abdomen. Despite his serious wounds, the student once again broke free and ran towards Belgrave Middleway pursued by two of the gang. Only when the lad collapsed metres from his front door did the pair run off with Singh shouting triumphantly 'I've stabbed him!' As their attackers fled, Ms Laight made a frantic call to police in which she begged for help. Officers were immediately dispatched and provided life-saving first aid until medics arrived and took the pair to hospital. Mr Vos was placed in a medically induced coma with doctors fearing the worst as a vein near to his spine and leading from the back of his heart had been severed. 'Shocking attack': Singh (left) and his accomplice Luke Timby (right), who held Mr Vos while he was stabbed, have been jailed for seven and six years respectively . Meanwhile, a police helicopter was dispatched to hunt the gang, who were all caught in the hours following the attack. When Singh was arrested, he told officers: 'I may as well cough it now, I've got a knife in my shoe.' When tested, the weapon was found to have traces of the victim's blood on the blade. Ranjit Lallie, mitigating for Singh, said what happened was a 'moment of madness'. Singh was jailed for seven years at Birmingham Crown Court on Friday after previously pleading guilty to wounding with intent, affray and possessing a knife. Timby, 15, was sentenced to six years in a young offenders institution after he was found guilty of wounding with intent and affray. The four other attackers were found guilty of affray and wounding. Sentencing the four boys, Justice Judge Creed said: 'This was a shocking attack. The victim went to his girlfriend's rescue and was set upon suffering life-threatening wounds. 'You show remorse but no-one showed concern for the victim on that night you simply ran away.' Judge Creed deemed the case so serious that for the two main offenders he lifted the usual reporting restrictions which give anonymity to people under 18 years old. Speaking after the case, Detective Chief Inspector Simon Wallis, of West Midlands Police, said: 'Our determination to bring those responsible to justice reflects the seriousness with which West Midlands Police and society in general regards knife crime.'","Guriyot Singh, 17, stabbed Edward Vos, 19, in chest, abdomen and elbow .

New allegations: The Met Police will reveal that Jimmy Savile abused the sick and dying at a UK hospice . Jimmy Savile targeted at least one UK hospice where he abused sick and dying patients, as well as the staff caring for them, an official report will reveal this week. The Metropolitan Police will also name hospitals, prisons and schools across the UK where the paedophile DJ sexually assaulted and raped at least 200 people. Although Savile's abuse at Stoke Mandeville, Broadmoor and Leeds General Infirmary hospitals have become well-known since his death, it is thought he may have attacked people in at least seven other places. Some of these institutions allowed him to wander around freely, handed him sets of keys to visit out of hours and even gave him his own room with a bed to sleep in. But his attacks in the unnamed hospice were unknown until now. Mark Williams-Thomas, the former policeman whose ITV documentary exposed Savile, said: 'There seems to be nowhere Savile went . where he did not abuse people.' The name and location of the hospice will be revealed in the Met's first report into his crimes, written by officers working on Operation Yewtree. Scotland Yard told MailOnline today they would not comment on the latest allegations but confirmed their report would be released imminently. The Met say a total of 31 allegations of rape have been made against Savile so far. And 589 people have come forward with information relating to the scandal, with a total of 450 complaints against the BBC presenter and DJ himself, mainly alleging sexual abuse. Meanwhile, DJ Dave Lee Travis has been bailed again by police investigating the Jimmy Savile sex abuse scandal and other unconnected allegations. The former Radio One presenter denied groping two women in BBC studios when he was held in November and said that in the past, tactile behaviour was regarded as 'giving somebody a cuddle'. Travis, 67, has taken great pains to distance himself from Savile and stressed the allegations against him have 'nothing to do with kids' and are not linked to the disgraced TV presenter. He spoke out in the wake of his . arrest to say he had been accused of 'squeezing the boobs of a couple of . women' - something he vigorously denied. The DJ - known as DLT - was held at 7.45am on November 15 and later released on bail. Attacks: Jimmy Savile with female patients at Stoke Mandeville Hospital. The DJ's abuse there and at other institutions have become well known . He is alleged to have put his hand up one woman's skirt and 'jiggled' the breasts of another. The Magic AM presenter was taken off air by the radio station's owners when the claims emerged. He was granted bail for a second time today and ordered to return to a police station on an unspecified date in March, Scotland Yard said. Ten weeks after the launch of Operation Yewtree, police recorded 199 crimes in 17 force areas in which Savile is a suspect, with 31 allegations of rape. Others who have been arrested include former pop star Gary Glitter, comedian Freddie Starr, publicist Max Clifford and Jim Davidson. Those four are on police bail. They have denied the allegations. Ten men in total have been arrested by Yewtree officers. Today Esther Rantzen launched a blistering attack on the Jimmy Savile police inquiry team over its concentration on arresting celebrities. The ChildLine founder claimed Scotland Yard’s high-profile Operation Yewtree’s focus on the famous could even jeopardise the chances of young abuse victims seeing justice. She said the £2million investigation was in danger of trivialising and sensationalising child abuse.

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . PUBLISHED: . 05:15 EST, 7 January 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 07:21 EST, 7 January 2013 . The UK Independence Party could help form the next government, leader Nigel Farage claimed today. Despite not having a single MP in Parliament, Mr Farage claimed his party’s trajectory could mean he plays the role of deciding who becomes Prime Minister in the event of another hung parliament. The extraordinary boast comes as David Cameron tries to see off the electoral threat posed by the Eurosceptic party with a landmark speech in the Netherlands on Tory policy for Britain’s future relationship with Brussels. UKIP Leader Nigel Farage claimed he could help form a coalition in the event of another hung parliament in 2015 . Tensions have been growing between the Conservatives and UKIP after Mr Farage’s party’s poll ratings soared, reaching 16 per cent in a poll yesterday – up from 4.5 per cent a year ago. Mr Cameron yesterday branded UKIP 'pretty odd people' in a fresh attack which Mr Farage had suggested would make an electoral pact before polling day impossible. But the UKIP boss said that if the progress in the polls continues, he could help form the next government if there was another hung parliament. ‘Don’t think about UKIP forming the government in 2015 but if we continue at anything like our current progress, who knows? ‘The “first-past-the-post” system is brutal to a party like us, we’ve got a lot of work to do on that and to build up our stronger areas, but who’s to say that in 2015 UKIP may well be needed in a coalition?’ However, he warned against getting carried away by good poll ratings. ‘When David Steel said to the Liberal party “go home and prepare for government”, it made him a laughing stock and people are still laughing at him about that now. ‘We’ve got to keep our feet on the ground. We are making progress, we’re not yet a party that is poised to take government in this country,' he told BBC Radio 4. ‘We are a voice for good, ordinary people in this country, we are not hidebound by political correctness, we’ve proved ourselves to be great campaigners, let’s see how the UKIP story evolves.’ David Cameron took a swipe at UKIP supporters, branding them 'pretty odd people' as former Labour minister Lord Mandelson warned putting a question mark over Britain's EU membership was 'economically insane' UKIP are predicted to win the European Parliament elections in 2014 and beaten both Tory and Lib Dem candidates in by-elections. A Survation survey for the Mail on Sunday put Labour on 38 per cent, the Tories on 29, UKIP on 16 and the Lib Dems on 11. Translated . into votes at the  next General Election, that would cost the . Conservatives 51 seats and present Labour with a thumping victory and an . overall majority of 94. Mr Cameron renewed his attack on UKIP yesterday, saying it contains some ‘pretty odd people’. He spoke as a poll suggested that the anti-Brussels party is enjoying record support, at 16 per cent, taking third place from the Lib Dems. Asked yesterday on the BBC about his previous description of UKIP supporters as ‘fruitcakes, loonies and closet racists’, Mr Cameron said: ‘There are some pretty odd people.’ But Mr Farage hit back: 'Do I want a party where we've got some eccentrics and occasionally someone causes us an embarrassment – or do I want a party made up of a bland lot of ghastly people whose names I don't even know? 'I'm in politics, and I've never heard of half the MPs who come on the telly. I meet them at cocktail parties and after 30 minutes I can't remember their name,' he told The Guardian. The Prime Minister is expected to give a major speech on repatriating powers from Brussels in the Netherlands before the end of the month. He will rule out the idea of leaving the EU to become a trading partner, like Norway, and instead advocate using moves by eurozone countries towards closer integration to bring powers back to London. The 'fresh settlement' would then be put to British voters in a referendum. But today former Labour Business Secretary Lord Mandelson, an ex-European commissioner, warned the Prime Minister not to think he can '""put a gun' to the heads of EU leaders over repatriating powers. In an article for the Guardian he wrote: 'The Prime Minister seems to think he can only pacify his party by conceding to anti-Europeans their long coveted referendum. 'I think his hopes for buying peace will be disappointed. The Tories risk dividing into irreconcilable factions, those who want to adjust the terms of Britain's EU membership in order to stay in, and those who will do everything they can to get Britain out. 'That's what happens when madness takes over a political party. Ask anyone who was in the Labour party in the 1980s. 'Beginning 2013 by placing this large and indefinite question mark over our membership of the EU, and all the trade and investment privileges it brings us, can only be described as economically insane.'","Party boss says surge in polls could secure enough MPs to hold the balance of power in another hung parliament .

A man who was shot 20 times with a pellet gun for appearing to be Middle Eastern refused to retaliate even though he had an actual gun on him at the time. 'I don't know. I just couldn't do it,' Cameron Mohammed said when asked why he did not shoot back at Daniel Quinnell when Quinnell attacked him in the parking lot of a Walmart in Lutz, Florida. Quinnell believed that Mohammed was Muslim or from the Middle East but he is neither: he was born and raised in Florida and his parents are from Trinidad, and he is Catholic. Surveillance video shows Quinnell, who has been arrested 10 times with a number of battery and assault charges, approached 24-year-old Mohammed as he was walking into the store around 3am on Wednesday with his girlfriend. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Victim and attacker: Cameron Mohammed (left) was born in Florida and his parents are from Trinidad, but Daniel Quinnell (right) assumed that he was Muslim and from the Middle East, neither of which are true . He told police that as he and his girlfriend- whose name has not been released- walked from their car into the Walmart to get some food, Quinnell asked Mohammed if he was Muslim or if he was from the Middle East. Mohammed is neither, as his parents are from Trinidad but he was born and raised in Tampa, and he is Catholic. Mohammed simply replied no and kept walking, but that was not sufficient for Quinnell. The 25-year-old allegedly yelled at Mohammed for being a 'n***** with a white girl' as he shot him with a gas-propelled pellet gun. Walking in: Mohammed (second from left) is walking in from the parking lot with his girlfriend (left) as Quinnell (right) follows them. The fourth person is unrelated and uninvolved in the incident . First shot: After asking if Mohammed is Muslim or from the Middle East, Quinnell begins to fire his pellet gun at close range and Mohammed's girlfriend takes his prior advice and looks for cover . Firing: Quinnell went on to fire 20 shots at Mohammed before running away . When police finally captured Quinnell and told him that Mohammed was neither Muslim nor Middle Eastern, he reportedly replied that he didn't care and 'they're all the same'. The security footage shows Mohammed's girlfriend quickly run to hide behind a column as the shooter begins to fire at close range at her boyfriend. Mohammed told The Tampa Bay Times that there was a reason for her move, as Mohammed said that he previously told her that if they were ever in harm's way, that she would stay quiet and find cover. The video also shows Mohammed's hand go for his waist where he kept his holstered gun, but he never chose to fire. 'I couldn't blow this guy away for something he could change later in life. I'm not going to decide this man's fate,' Mohammed told The Tamba Bay Times. He bought his weapon legally and has had a concealed weapons permit for the past five years. Quinnell's . weapon was also legal: he told officers that he knew he was not allowed . to own a firearm so he purchased a pellet gun, which uses compressed . air inside metal casings making it a non-lethal weapon. That said, it still did damage to Mohammed as he now has to have surgery to have a pellet removed from above his eye. Tipped off: Police released security footage from the Walmart that showed Quinnell's face, leading to his own mother tipping them off about his whereabouts . Criminal history: Quinnell has been arrested 10 previous times and he said that he knew he was not allowed to have a real gun because of those felonies so that is why he used a pellet gun . 'This is a heinous crime, there's no doubt about it,' Pasco County Sheriff Chris Nocco said. Police eventually captured Quinnell with the help of his own mother. She called the tipline and told them the room number that he was staying in at the Comfort Inn off a highway on Land O'Lakes. He was charged with aggravated assault. There are haunting similarities between this assault and the incident in New York City where a racist woman pushed a man she believed to be Middle Eastern onto the subway tracks as a train was approaching. That victim, Sunando Sen, was from India and not the Middle East, and the attacker, Erika Menendez, used 'Hindu' and 'Muslim' interchangeably in her police statement, showing that she clearly does not understand the difference. The New York Police Department spokesman described her statement as effectively saying: 'I pushed a Muslim off the train tracks because I hate Hindus and Muslims ever since 2001 when they put down the twin towers I’ve been beating them up.' Sen died on the tracks in Queens on December 29. WATCH THE VIDEO HERE .","Daniel Quinnell, 25, arrested for shooting Cameron Mohammed, 24, with pellet gun 20 times in Walmart parking lot .

Tragic: Chevonea Kendall-Bryan, 13, fell 60ft from a London block of flats a month after being bullied into a sex act by two boys, an inquest heard . A 13-year-old girl being bullied at school plunged to her death weeks after being sexually abused at a party, an inquest heard. Teenager Chevonea Kendall-Bryan fell 60ft from the top floor window of Seldon House in Battersea, south-west London, in March last year . Her friends said Chevonea, who self-harmed, was the victim of school bullying, and it emerged that a month before she died she had been molested by a boy at a party. The next day she was then forced to perform a sex act on another boy, it was claimed. Her mother, Amanda Kendall, also told North Westminster Coroners’ Court how her daughter was slapped and pushed by other pupils. 'Chevonea was very bubbly and always laughing and joking. She was a nice little girl,' she said. 'She was getting bullied. It started with name calling but got physical - tripping her up, pushing, slapping. 'She wasn’t the same bubbly person she was when she started at school. Matters got worse, she started self-harming - cutting herself on her arm. 'That was a way of taking away the pain of being bullied.' But despite the bullying easing as Chevonea entered year nine, it got worse a month before she died. Ms Kendall said her daughter was at a party where she was forced to carry out a sex act on a boy. The next day she was bullied into doing it again on another boy who threatened her and her home, the inquest heard. North Westminster Coroners’ Court heard how Chevonea suffered cardiac arrest following the fall, and died from severe injuries to the brain. A witness statement from London Ambulance Service paramedic Ian Kirton said: 'I was directed to the outside by an unknown member of the public. 'Turning the corner, I found a young female lying on the ground. She was unresponsive. 'There was an adult lying by her head, who informed me she had fallen from an open window. 'The patient had obvious head injuries. Shortly after the medical team arrived, she went into cardiac arrest so life support was undertaken.' Scene: Miss Kendall-Bryan fell to her death from the window of the flat she lived in Battersea (top right) Chevonea was rushed to King’s College Hospital still in cardiac arrest, where she died just before 9pm surrounded by her family. Chevonea's mother Amanda Kendall claimed she warned her school of an impending tragedy if they did not step in to tackle bullying - six months before the teenager died, the inquest heard. Ms Kendall and Chevonea's godmother wrote to the school in October 2010 demanding action over 'disgusting' abuse being aimed at the girl. Claims: Her mother Angela Kendall (pictured) told the Westminster inquest how her daughter had been 'bubbly' but bullying had led to her self-harming . 'Will it take a tragedy to happen before the school actively stops these two boys from bullying a vulnerable girl?', they asked. The alleged bullies had been asked to sign a contract agreeing not to persecute Chevonea, but the letter accused the school of failing to enforce it or take sterner action. Ms Kendall also demanded the bullies be excluded immediately. Her teenage daughter also refused to tell police who had allegedly attacked her and pleaded with her mother to drop the matter, her mother said. 'She was scared of being called a snitch, a snake, by talking to the police', she said. Of the bullying, she told the hearing: 'She said it was bad, there were hand gestures and calling her names. 'I wanted to tell the school, but she said 'what's the point of telling the school, nothing was ever going to be done about it'. 'By me telling the school, she didn't want it to come up again, the allegations of sexual abuse and that.' The school reported the alleged sex attacks on Chevonea after she pleaded with her mother not to pursue the allegations. 'I had a conversation with Chevonea saying she didn't want to report it, but the teacher reported it on my behalf because I didn't want it to seem like I was going against her wishes', she said. Michael John, Chevonea's step-father, told the inquest he heard the sound of her falling from the window, but said there were no signs of her being depressed or upset that evening. 'I came in as normal and Chev was in the bedroom playing with the baby', he said. 'I asked if she was alright, and she said she was fine. 'She was laughing and playing with the baby, it thought it was a normal day.' The inquest has heard Chevonea's relationship with her mother had broken down since the birth of her baby with Mr John. The inquest, which is expected to last five days, continues.","Chevonea Kendall-Bryan had also been forced into performing a sex act on a different boy a month before she died, her inquest was told .

Poachers have killed a family of 11 elephants in the biggest mass shooting of the animals on record in Kenya, wildlife officials have said. A gang of about ten attackers hacked off the elephants' tusks in Tsavo East National Park, on Saturday, in the latest sign of a resurgence of demand for ivory jewellery and ornaments, mainly coming from Asia. The Kenya Wildlife Service has now said foot, dog and aerial units were hunting the gang. An elephant forages at the Tsavo East National Park last year, the scene of the latest mass shooting which saw a family of 11 of the animals die . In a statement the service said: 'The entire family of 11 elephants have been confirmed poached and tusks chopped off. All the carcasses had bullet wounds.' Elephant poaching in Kenya declined sharply after 1989 when the government banned trade in ivory. But there has been a rise in the illegal practice in recent years. Kenya Wildlife Service spokesman Paul Udo said the latest killing was the worst single incident of its kind recorded in the East African country. He said: '(It) shows the great lengths these criminal cartels are ready to go to get ivory. It's really tragic.' Demand for ornamental ivory is rising fast in Asia in tandem with growing Chinese influence and investment in Africa. A Kenya Wildlife Service senior warden in 2008 holds one of hundreds of ivory tusks captured by his men from poachers at the park . In May, 359 tusks weighing 1.6 tonnes impounded in Sri Lanka were found to have come from Kenya's Mombasa port. Police found 214 tusks worth $1.32 million hidden in a coffin and fertiliser bags in neighbouring Tanzania in October.

John Tatton forced a teenager to pay her rent in 'sexual favours' A teenage girl who was forced to pay her rent with 'sexual favours' to an infamous trafficking gang has helped jail a tenth predatory paedophile. The victim, who was 15 at the time, was abused by landlord John Tatton, 72, after he forced her to pay the rent in 'sexual favours.' At the time the girl was being repeatedly abused by members of a group of nine men who preyed on underage teenage girls in Heywood, Rochdale, Greater Manchester, and who were later jailed for a total of 77 years. During police investigations into the ring, the girl told officers about her abuse ordeal at the hands of Tatton at a house in Rochdale. Today Tatton was jailed for four years after being convicted of five offences of sexual activity with a child and one offence of sexual assault. The girl had to testify against him during the five day trial, and she was one of a number of girls who gave evidence in the trial last year. Police said the victim had been going through some 'difficult times' at home and started to form friendships with a number of other teenage girls who had chaotic lifestyles involving alcohol, drugs and eventual sexual exploitation. She moved into a house in Heywood, near Rochdale, with a number of these other girls. Tatton, who owned the house, told the victim she couldn’t live there rent free and had to pay for her stay with sexual favours. Bolton Crown Court was told she was sexually abused by Tatton repeatedly over the course of six months. Tatton, now of Hanley, Stoke On Trent, denied wrongdoing. But Detective Constable Dave South, of Greater Manchester Police said: 'Tatton is a sexual predator who took complete advantage of a vulnerable teenage girl. 'He subjected her to a campaign of abuse over a six month period, during which she was forced to submit to him to ""pay"" for her rent. 'Tatton is clearly a danger to young people and I hope today’s sentence provides a level of reassurance to his victim.' Jailed: Shabir Ahmed, 59, (left) was jailed for 19 years for two rapes, aiding and abetting rape, sexual assault and trafficking for the purposes of sexual exploitation, and Abdul Aziz, 41, (right) was jailed for nine years for conspiracy and trafficking for sexual exploitation . Behind bars: Hamid Safi, 22, (left) was given four years for conspiracy and trafficking but was found not guilty of two counts of rape, and Adil Khan, 42, was found guilty of conspiracy and trafficking for sexual exploitation and jailed for eight years . Tatton was also ordered to sign the Sex Offenders Register for life. Last May nine Asian men were convicted of the systematic grooming and sexual abuse of white girls in Heywood and Rochdale. The . victims were vulnerable teenagers from deprived, dysfunctional . backgrounds who were targeted in 'honeypot locations' where young people . regularly congregated, such as takeaway food shops. Conviction: Abdul Rauf, 43, was found guilty of conspiracy and trafficking for sexual exploitation and jailed for six years . All the girls were coerced and bribed into keeping quiet about the abuse through a combination of free alcohol and drugs, food, small sums of money and other gifts. Although some of the victims willingly had sex with their abusers, others were physically assaulted and raped by as many as five men at a time. They were plied with drugs and alcohol and were passed around to friends and family being taken to various locations around the north of England. One 13-year old girl recounted that, after being forced to have sex in exchange for vodka, her abuser immediately raped her again and then gave her £40 to not say anything about the incident. Another thirteen-year-old victim had an abortion after becoming pregnant. The investigation led to three other inquiries being launched in the town and also led to Keir Starmer, QC, the Director of Public Prosecutions, to order a major overhaul of the Crown Prosecution Service’s response to sex grooming, with the aim of increasing the number of convictions. Mr Starmer admitted that a failure to understand the nature of abuse by police, prosecutors and the courts meant that men who groomed teenagers for sex had escaped justice for decades. The nine men were jailed for a total of 77 years last may, with their leader, divorced father-of-four Shabir Ahmed, 59, of Oldham, known as 'Daddy', being sentenced to 19 years. Mohammed Sajid, 35, of Rochdale, received 12 years for conspiracy, trafficking, one count of rape and one count of sexual activity with a child. Co-defendants: Abdul Qayyum (left), 43, and Mohammed Amin (right) 45, were both jailed for five years for their part in the grooming .

A driver who advertised on Facebook for a volunteer to take his speeding penalty points has been jailed. Scott Woodburn, 32, paid Daniel Baggaley, 26, £250 to admit his speeding . offence so he could escape being banned from driving, Highway officials said today. South Yorkshire Safer Roads Partnership said his five-month sentence given to him last month 'will send a warning to anyone who would consider anything so irresponsible'. Jailed: Scott Woodburn was caught speeding on the A61 Halifax Road in Sheffield, pictured, but asked a friend to take his points so he wouldn't be banned from driving . Woodburn, from Rotherham, was caught breaking the speed limit on the A61 Halifax Road in Sheffield on November 6, 2011. As a result of the single offence he was expected to have points added to his licence. But the points for speeding would have tipped him over the 12 point maximum of allowed penalty points and he could have been disqualified from driving. So according to the Safer Road Partnership, he posted on Facebook asking someone to take the points in return for payment. Baggaley, who does not hold a driving licence, took up his offer and admitted the speeding offence and was paid £250 by Woodburn. A spokesman for the partnership, which represents organisations including police, councils and the Highways Agency, said Woodburn refused to co-operate with the investigation and only pleaded guilty to perverting the course of justice when the strength of evidence against him became clear. Police used forensic evidence to prove it was Woodburn driving, the spokesman said. On top of the five-month prison sentence, Woodburn was disqualified from driving when he appeared at Sheffield Crown Court on December 19. Social networking: Woodburn posted on Facebook asking someone to take the points in return for payment . Baggaley, from Sheffield, received an 11-week prison sentence suspended for 12 months and a 12-month supervision order when he admitted the same offence in June last year. A spokesman for South Yorkshire Police confirmed Woodburn . had accumulated a number of points due to previous offences and the . latest speeding offence would have taken him over 12 points which could . have led to his disqualification from driving. The spokesman for South Yorkshire Safer Roads Partnership said: 'Hopefully this case will send a warning to anyone who would consider anything so irresponsible. 'It is a crime to admit an offence on behalf of someone else. If someone approaches you to admit an offence on their behalf you should inform the police. 'Woodburn showed no regard for anyone else. He was prepared to drive at excessive speed. Once caught, rather than changing the manner of his driving he selfishly paid to have someone else to take the blame so that he could continue behaving as before.' He added: 'South Yorkshire Safer Roads Partnership aim to improve road safety on South Yorkshire's roads by tracing and prosecuting serial offenders who provide false information in an attempt to avoid prosecution. These offenders are a danger to themselves and other road users.'","Scott Woodburn, 32, was caught speeding on A61 Halifax Road in Sheffield .

The woman was asked by 35-year-old Ritchie, as 'Marina', to go around to their home and have sex with her husband, Benjamin, film the events and send her the recording. After the woman had complied she received a message from 'Marina' threatening if she did not continue to have sex with Benjamin and film it, then the initial sex recording would be sent to her family and work colleagues. Under duress, the woman engaged in sexual activity again with Ritchie on a number of occasions before she became suspicious and reported him to police. Ritchie, who admitted rape and two counts of sexual assault, was jailed for seven years at Derby Crown Court. Investigating officer Detective Constable Claudia Musson said: 'Ritchie preyed on a vulnerable young woman and deceived her at every turn.

Abducted: Moira Anderson went missing in 1957 and is thought to have been murdered by rapist Alexander Gartshore . She has been missing, presumed murdered, for 56 years, but yesterday the search for schoolgirl Moira Anderson reached what is certain to be its final destination. In a graveyard a short distance from the 11-year-old's former home, police erected protective tents around a family lair where eight bodies are known to be buried. As officers prepare to begin exhuming the bodies, they may learn whether there is a ninth set of remains buried in the Upton family plot in Old Monkland Cemetery, Coatbridge, Lanarkshire. If an extra body is found, forensic tests will establish if it is that of Moira, who would have been 67 if she had lived. If nothing untoward is uncovered, then her disappearance will continue to haunt her family and hometown forever. The youngster is believed to have been abducted and murdered by Alexander Gartshore, who was driving the bus that Moira took as she set off to a local shop in Coatbridge on February 23, 1957. Gartshore, a known sex offender, was jailed for rape shortly after Moira's disappearance but he did not figure in the initial police inquiry. He died in 2006 shortly after telling his daughter Sandra Brown that Moira had haunted him all his life. Mrs Brown, 63, has believed for decades that her father was Moira's killer and it was she who identified the Upton family lair as the most likely burial spot. Last month, Sheriff Frank Pieri granted a petition brought by Moira's sisters Janet Hart and  Marjory Muir to allow exhumation after relatives of those buried in the lair raised no objections. Digging is expected to begin shortly . after dawn under a team led by forensic anthropologist Professor . Sue Black of Dundee University. The exhumation process may last several days. It . has been suggested that Gartshore secreted Moira's body into the lair . in the weeks following her death when the grave was opened for the . burial of Sinclair Upton, who died aged 80. It has emerged that Gartshore once told a colleague that Mr Upton had done him 'a big favour'. Mrs Brown, who has extensively researched the case, said: 'I believe in my heart we'll find her. 'The evidence we have only points in . that direction. I pray for a successful conclusion because, whatever . happens, this will be the last act. There is no other avenue to go . down.' Mrs Hart, 69, who lives in Australia, said: 'Our mother and father went to their graves never knowing  what happened to Moira. 'My sister and I are growing old. We don't want to suffer the same fate. We'll be by our phones, praying for news.'

Figures from the Office of National Statistics suggest the popularity of packages holidays is on the rise . Industry experts point out modern-day package holidays are now a far cry from the cheap and cheerful breaks to resorts such as Benidorm enjoyed by millions in the Sixties and Seventies. However, the prices of such breaks can start from £2,000 per person for long-haul destinations during peak weeks. And critics say many who book all-inclusives rarely venture out to experience the local culture. TUI Travel’s chief executive, Peter Long, said the package holiday has ‘evolved’. ‘When you look at our typical customers who take a package with us once a year, they are not seasoned travellers, they are hard-working people who want  a break in the sunshine,’ he added. ‘They want peace of mind and not to be shouting at each other when something goes wrong.’ According to a report by analysts at Morgan Stanley, the number of package holidays  sold grew 5 per cent between 2010 and 2012.

Two of the Kennedy cousins spoke out about their battles with addiction, saying that their family’s history with substance abuse contributed significantly to their own health problems. Christopher Kennedy Lawford said that he began drinking and using drugs when he was only 12-years-old and he ‘had desire to stop, I had all the resources to stop, and it was difficult for me’. He is now 26-years sober and has written a book about battling addictions, but the fight is much more fresh for his cousin, former Congressman Patrick Kennedy. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEOS . Family troubles: Christopher Kennedy Lawford (left) and his cousin former Congressman Patrick Kennedy (right) appeared on the Today Show to talk about their respective battles with substance abuse . Knowledge: Christopher, who is the son of JFK's sister Patricia, said that he wrote about about addiction because he learned a great deal from his own experiences, having started drinking at age 12 . Patrick, who is the son of the late Senator Ted Kennedy, will be two years sober next month meaning that his last relapse was right around the time that he finished his term as the Representative for Rhode Island. ‘It took me leaving my public life to finally get into long-term sobriety. Before, it was stopping and starting, stopping and starting. That's the case for most people with these illnesses,’ he said during their joint appearance on the Today Show Monday morning. The cousins were speaking about their personal health issues while promoting the book that Christopher wrote about various expert advice on treating addiction. ‘People ask me where my addiction came from and I say I was the prodigy of an addictive perfect storm. I have the genetics. Alcoholism didn't run in my family, it galloped,’ Christopher said in interview with Huffington Post Live. Political family: Patrick's father the late Senator Ted Kennedy (right, seen with his brothers former President John F Kennedy at the left and former Senator Robert in the middle) was said to be a heavy drinker . Christopher is the son of Patricia . Kennedy, whose brothers included former President John F. Kennedy and . Senators Robert and Edward Kennedy. Patrick’s . deceased father Ted Kennedy was known to be a heavy drinker and was involved in a fatal . car accident in Chappaquidick Island where alcohol is thought to have . been a factor. His mother Joan, who later divorced Ted, has openly . admitted she is an alcoholic. Bobby Kennedy’s 11 children have all had public issues with drugs. RFK . Jr. was arrested for heroin possession in 1983, and more recently his . estranged wife Mary killed herself amid an on-going battle with . depression and addiction. His younger brother David died of a drug overdose in 1984 while on vacation in Palm Beach. Their . sister Kerry, who used to be married to current-New York governor . Andrew Cuomo, was in a car accident earlier this year after allegedly . becoming disoriented while on the sleeping pill Ambien. Jean Kennedy’s son William Kennedy Smith was accused of drunkenly raping a woman after returning home from a bar. While he did not go into specifics about the types of drugs he used, his book includes references to alcohol, pills and heroin. He . said that in addition to genetics, the general culture of the time and . his family dynamics also contributed to his substance abuse. ‘When . I began my drug use at the age of 12 (in 1969) it was an entirely . different culture. You know back then it was just after the summer of . love it was all about experimentation we didn't know what we know today . and we accepted behavior that we wouldn't accept today,’ he told . Huffington Post Live. ‘We . know today that an adolescent who suffers great trauma in their . adolescence who has genetic frontloading for addiction is much more 40 . per cent more likely to develop this later in life. I had huge trauma as . a kid, both my uncles were assassinated, I come from a divorce. ‘There's a lot of stuff that I didn’t know what was going on but I was looking for medication.’ He said that after having to try to beat the disease a number of times, he became suicidal and just wanted to give up. ‘I was going to kill myself but I didn't really want to kill myself so I did the next thing which was basically I surrendered. I didn't really realize I was doing that at the time but I did the one person in the world I didn't want to call, a relative of mine who I had competed with my whole life, and I said tell me what to do and he told me what to do,’ he said without naming which relative provided relief. Working on it: Patrick Kennedy said that he has been sober for nearly two years, and that it helped having resigned from his post in Congress because now he can focus on his personal life . ‘If he had said ""Crawl on your belly over broken glass to New York"" I would have done it. So that's the level of surrender that's necessary.’ Christopher and Patrick are far from the only Kennedys who have a history of drug problems. Patrick’s father Ted was known to be a heavy drinker and was involved in a fatal car accident in Chappaquidick Island where alcohol is thought to have been a factor. His mother Joan, who later divorced Ted, has openly admitted she is an alcoholic. Problems: RFK Jr, seen here with his late ex-wife Mary, was arrested for heroin possession in 1983, and Mary had issues with drugs and alcohol before her suicide in 2012 . Fatal: David (center) Kennedy, another son of Bobby's, died in a drug overdose at the age of 28 in 1984 . Latest: Kerry Kennedy, one of Robert's daughters seen here with her mother Ethel, was involved in a car accident in 2012 and she told police that she had just taken the prescription sleeping pill Ambien . Among the other cousins, three of Bobby Kennedy’s 11 children have all had public issues with drugs. RFK Jr. was arrested for heroin possession in 1983, and more recently his estranged wife Mary killed herself amid an on-going battle with depression and addiction. His younger brother David died of a drug overdose in 1984 while on vacation in Palm Beach.

Jean Kennedy’s son William Kennedy Smith was accused of drunkenly raping a woman after returning home from a bar. Trifecta: Christopher said that his genetics, the childhood traumas of his uncle's assassinations and parent's divorce, and the culture of drug use at the time all contributed to his substance abuse battle . Patrick and Christopher say that their family’s struggles with curbing addiction- even though they are wealthy enough to afford treatment- shows that the disease cannot be won or lost because of money. ‘One of the things that Chris and I have had access to is good treatment but most Americans are trying to fly in the night in terms of what's understanding out there and what is good for them,’ Christopher said on the Today Show. ‘I come from a family where when we have a hardship or we have a challenge we meet it and we try to make lemonade out of lemons and that's sort of what I did here. The need was so profound and I come from a family that the ethic of public service is really strong,’ he explained to Huffington Post Live as the rationale for his new book. ‘My Uncle Teddy would be really mad at me if I turned my back on this.’ WATCH THE VIDEOS HERE .

More stores are expected to go bust following a Christmas that saw families tightening their belts and spending less money on the high street. The warning comes from the British Retail Consortium against the background of the longest cost of living squeeze in a century. With families cutting back over Christmas, the value of sales through bricks and mortar outlets in December dropped compared with last year. Foreign factor: Experts said stores were boosted by customers from China and the Middle East. Shoppers are pictured on Boxing Day at Selfridges in London . The figure would have been even worse but for a last minute rush on the weekend before Christmas, with shoppers taking advantage of savage price cuts on gifts and clothes. The total value of retail sales in the  crucial month of December rose by an ‘underwhelming’ 1.5 per cent. But the experts said it was only the increase in online shopping – where sales rose 17.8 per cent on a year ago – that ensured total retail sales did not fall into the red. The figures were revealed as the UK’s fourth largest supermarket, Morrisons, announced its Christmas sales were down by 2.5 per cent. Customers switched to budget rivals, such as Aldi and Lidl, and internet shopping, which Morrisons does not offer. The high street is facing an unprecedented squeeze as struggling families cut back on their spending and switch to shopping online. Families battered by rising food and energy prices, which have outpaced increases in pay and pensions for four years, are making major lifestyle changes and are spending less and less on the high street. Retail chains closed stores at a rate of 32 a day during last year in a dramatic escalation of the crisis turning many urban centres into ghost towns. Falling: The UK's fourth largest supermarket, Morrisons, said its Christmas sales were down by 2.5 per cent . A number of household names – Comet, . Peacocks, La Senza, Blacks, Game, Clinton Cards, and JJB Sports – all . went into administration. And the BRC say this trend is likely to continue into 2013. It said half of all squeezed families – 51 per cent – intend to cut back on food spending over the next six months. Sales of traditional toys fell this Christmas as youngsters switched to technology such as tablets and smartphones. Money spent on toys that involve handling, building or the imagination were down by two per cent during 2012, according to the BRC. It said: ‘Toys didn’t have the best Christmas ever. Some items like Lego were particularly trendy, but retailers reported a shift in the Christmas shopping pattern seeing interest for traditional toys and gifts replaced by more electronic items, tablets in particular.’ Traditionalists will rue the change in culture, for many technology based games involve solitary play, rather than groups, and leave little room for imagination. Apart from tablets, such as the Apple iPads, Amazon Kindle series and Google Nexus, the BRC said there were strong sales for trendy earmuff style headphones. It said department stores had a good Christmas and highlighted the huge influx of foreign tourists for the January sales, who were chasing designer handbags and shoes. The BRC said: ‘A significant portion of the growth came from ‘export’ sales to customers from China, the Middle East and Nigeria.’ The figure rises to 67 per cent for . parents with teenagers, who are finding it particularly tough to put . food on the table while paying for other essentials. It suggests Government pledges to tackle high street decline and the decision to hire ‘Queen of Shops’ Mary Portas to devise a rescue plan have little chance of success. Miss Portas published an action plan last year calling for measures to make it easier to change shops to other uses, more free parking in towns and cuts in business rates. Following her proposals, the Government announced that 15 towns would be given £100,000 each to resurrect their fortunes as part of a project that Miss Portas will feature in a new TV series. But the scheme has been dismissed by critics. Even Miss Portas has admitted that a number of high streets are beyond saving and town centres need to be switched to other uses such as housing, schools, gyms and community facilities. BRC director general Helen Dickinson warned of tough times, saying: ‘During 2012, the number of shop failures went up by about 6 per cent on the previous year. ‘Looking into 2013, with a tough environment there is a risk that we are going to see more of the same. ‘Growth in sales is effectively flat once you strip out the changes in shop prices. ‘If you are operating in a low growth environment with costs you need to manage, that becomes more and more difficult.’ She said families do not have the cash to spend, which means there is little hope of any improvement. 'Queen of shops': Mary Portas published an action plan last year calling for measures to make it easier to change shops to other uses, more free parking in towns and cuts in business rates . ‘If you look at the amount of money people have got in their pockets that is expected to continue to be under pressure. Consumers can’t create money out of nowhere,’ she said. The BRC’s Retail Sales Monitor is compiled in partnership with accountants KPMG, whose head of retail, David McCorquodale, said: ‘While consumer confidence remains low, shoppers will tighten their belts and rein in their spending, making life difficult for the average retailer. ‘There will be no boom and it’s likely more than a few will go bust.’ Morrisons’ disappointing Christmas figures were driven by a shift in shopping habits towards budget stores. The company also lost out because it does not have as many small convenience stores as rivals and is not selling groceries via the internet. It is expected to make a move into online food sales later this year, while it has signed up Ant and Dec to front its advertising.","BRC warning against backdrop of longest living cost squeeze in a century .

Researchers believe companies could save millions of pounds by analysing the emails of suspected employers . The most common words used by rogue traders and fraudsters when emailing about their plans at work have been revealed by investigators working with the FBI. 'Cover up', 'write off', 'illegal', and 'failed investment' were used most often by employees carrying out rogue trading and fraud. Ernst & Young's Fraud Investigation and Dispute Services Practice collaborated with the FBI  using specialist software to identify more than 3,000 terms. Researchers say the analysis of emails written by employees under suspicion could save companies millions of pounds by flagging  concerns before money is lost through fraud. Fraud investigators said that suspicious terms such as 'nobody will find out', 'grey area' and 'they owe it to me' were also among the most used phrases. 'Special fees' and 'friendly payments' were regularly used in bribery cases and phrases such as 'do not volunteer information' revealed concern at getting caught out. Rashmi Joshi, director of the company's Fraud Investigation and Disputes Services, said the research and new technology can help businesses identify rogue trader behaviour earlier. Cover up .

Shee told the website that analysis of language and statistics can help 'identify rogue trader behaviour' in a cost effective way, as well other fraud, abuse and employee misconduct. Also in the research, investigators found that employees often disclose their reservations about the plans with phrases such as 'want no part of this' and 'don't leave a trail'. They also try to rationalise their behaviour in emails by saying 'not hurting anyone', 'won't miss it', 'fix it later' and 'told me to'. The specialist software used by investigators also scanned for phrases that showed the writer did not want to leave a trail, such as 'call my mobile' or 'come by my office'. It was also used to track and highlight changes in tone and language.

She is one of the world's most iconic boats which for almost 40 years travelled the world's seas. But following retirement in 2008, the much-loved Queen Elizabeth 2, known as the QE2, is now under threat of being broken up and sold for scrap. However, an ambitious multi-million pound scheme has now emerged to save the boat by permanently moving it to London and opening it as a plush hotel on the River Thames. The vessel is currently based in Dubai and its owners are said to be in talks with China about stripping it for scrap metal. But it is hoped that this can be prevented by moving the ship to London and transforming it into a luxury hotel. Ambitious: A multi-million pound scheme has now emerged to save the QE2 by permanently moving it to London and opening it as a plush hotel on the River Thames. This image shows how the boat, bottom right, could look . Base: She would be stationed at Carlsberg Wharf, opposite the O2 Arena, in London . She would be stationed at Carlsberg . Wharf - opposite the O2 Arena, and near the Emirates Cable Car, Excel . Conference Centre, and Canary Wharf. If . approved, the ambitious multi-million pound scheme would save the . retired ship from the threat of being broken up and sold for scrap. The Mayor of London's office have been informed of the plans and Government ministers have been urged to back them. Shipping expert Martin Cox, who runs the website Maritime Matters, said a reception building and walkway would be built on the riverside. Position: The boat would be located on the opposite side of this bank . Arrival: The Queen Elizabeth 2 is escorted by the UAE coast guard as she arrives in Dubai, United Arab Emirates following her retirement in 2008 . And the five star development could even house a decommissioned Concorde aeroplane. He . said: 'Recent correspondence with the Mayor of London's office and . other related UK sources illuminated a fully realised vision for QE2's . next era on the River Thames. 'Phase . One would see the whole area of Carlsberg Wharf demolished, replacing . it with parking, a reception building and a walkway to the ship. 'Phase Two would include the construction of additional commercial visitor attraction buildings, and possibly incorporate the supersonic Concorde plane. 'Of the original passenger accommodation, it is intended to use the 330 first class cabins and 250 of the larger tourist cabins for the hotel.' The QE2 spent 39 years carrying passengers around the world in luxury after she was launched by cruise firm Cunard in 1969. The QE2 was launched at the yard of John Brown in Clydebank, Scotland, pictured, in 1967 . She left her home port of Southampton for the last time in November 2008, sailing to Dubai.She was due to open as an international tourist attraction but development stalled as the global recession took hold and she has not moved since. The ship's Dubai owners are now said to be in talks with China about stripping it for scrap metal. Former owner Cunard has cast doubt on the reports - but fans of the legendary liner fear for her future. Almost 1,000 people have already signed an official e-petition urging the Government to support the 'QE2 London' project. It would be an expensive operation because the QE2 is unlikely to be able to make the voyage from Dubai under her own power after a long lay-up. QE2 would be loaded with enough ballast to sit on the tidal river bed and open as a five-star hotel with tours for the public. The QE2 was initially designed as a transatlantic service between her home port of Southampton and New York. Operated by Cunard, she began an almost 40 year career in 1969 and served as the flagship of the line until succeeded by RMS Queen Mary 2 in 2004. During her years of service, the QE2 undertook regular world cruises and was known as being the height of glamour. Historic: Queen Elizabeth II questions one of the experts as she tours the kitchens during a visit to the QE2 at Southampton on the eve of the liner's maiden trans-Atlantic voyage to New York in 1969 . Originally featuring three classes of service, the ship appealed to stars such as Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton and also captured the imagination of those less affluent,who were blocked by stairways and elevators from entering first-class spaces even for a peek. Passengers dressed for dinner in formal gowns and tuxedos and top-name show-biz stars entertained. In May 1982 she even took part in the Falklands War, carrying 3000 troops and 650 volunteer crews. This involved her being refitted with three helicopter pads, dormitories and fuel pipes to allow for refuelling at sea. Incredibly, more than 650 Cunard crew members volunteered for the voyage to transport the members of the Fifth Infantry Brigade. The vessel returned to the UK in June 1982 and was greeted in Southampton by Queen Elizabeth, the Queen Mother.","She would be stationed opposite the O2 Arena in London .

A woman has been arrested for allegedly orchestrating a plot to kill her husband in a drive-by shooting after she started a romantic relationship with their 21-year-old adopted son. Amy Bessey, 42, allegedly enlisted the help of her son, Michael Bessey, and her brother, Richard Pearson, 39, to shoot her husband as he drove on Interstate 15 near Las Vegas, Nevada on November 14. Robert Bessey, who was going through a divorce with his wife, was struck by a bullet in the neck around 4.30am after a gunman fired a shot from a  gold SUV driving alongside him. But he survived and identified the SUV as belonging to Richard Pearson's girlfriend. Michael Bessey and Pearson . were charged in the murder plot last year, but police only implicated Amy Bessey last week when her son told his cellmate that she had been involved. She was arrested by Las Vegas police on Friday on charges of attempted murder, battery and conspiracy to commit murder against her husband, the Las Vegas Review-Journal reported. She was apparently motivated by a a $250,000 insurance policy on Robert Bessey's life, which was due to expire after their divorce was finalized. Police said the unusual relationship between Amy Bessey and her son also appeared to be a motive. Robert Bessey told detectives that his wife and son's 'close' relationship had prompted the divorce, while Michael Bessey's ex-girlfriend said Amy was also the reason they had broken up. Co-conspirators: Her adopted son, Michael Bessey, left, and her brother, Richard Pearson, allegedly carried out the attempted murder last year. Amy Bessey allegedly has an 'unnatural relationship' with her son . Relatives claimed the pair had an 'unnatural relationship' and one friend said they would go to nightclubs together and 'grab each other's buttocks', police said. Robert Bessey also told police that he had read a letter his son had written to his wife from jail which said: 'I miss touching you'. The man added that his wife and son both had made various statements wishing he were dead. But Amy Bessey was only implicated in the gruesome plot when her son's cellmate, Tremel Palmer, claimed he told him that the three planned the killing and were shocked Mr Bessey survived. Plot: Michael Bessey, pictured brandishing a gun on his Facebook page, allegedly told his cellmate that he shot his father to get money from his life insurance plan so he could buy a truck . 'Close': Michael Bessey, left, allegedly wrote his mother, right, a letter from jail saying: 'I miss touching you' Michael Bessey allegedly told Palmer that he was the one who had fired the bullet. He and Pearson then went to a diner for Amy Bessey to collect them, he allegedly said. Michael Bessey added that he expected to receive a total of $400,000 from the death, with which he would buy a truck, while his mother would pay off her mortgage, police said. Bessey said that he wanted his father dead as he had physically abused his mother and mentally abused the family, the Journal-Review reported. He added that he planned to blame the plot on his uncle, Richard Pearson, who recently finished a prison sentence, by claiming the man had forced him to get involved at gunpoint. Scene: Robert Bessey was shot in the neck as he drove along Interstate 15, pictured, near Las Vegas . In an eerie twist following the shooting, Amy Pearson cooperated with police and handed over her brother and her son to police by identifying them in a video taken at a gas station near the scene. After her son was arrested in November, she told the Review-Journal: 'I have no idea what's going on. I wish I did'. Michael Bessey, Richard Pearson and Amy Pearson have all been charged with attempted murder with a deadly weapon, conspiracy to commit murder and battery with a deadly weapon resulting in substantial bodily harm. Richard Pearson was also charged with violation of parole. Amy Bessey will appear in Las Vegas Justice Court on Wednesday.","Amy Bessey 'had an unnaturally close relationship with her son'

"By . Guy Smallman In Kabul . PUBLISHED: . 07:16 EST, 8 January 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 09:43 EST, 8 January 2013 . On a frozen windswept hill on the outskirts of Kabul, half a dozen Pashtun men broke the icy ground with pick axes. Nearby, the body of eighteen-month-old Saiyma Gadazai lay wrapped in a plain blanket, her pale face glowing in the gold winter sun. All morning her mother and aunts had washed her remains and prayed over her, in keeping with Muslim tradition. Now the men and boys took responsibility for her final journey. Heartbreaking: The tiny body of eighteen-month-old Saiyma Gadazai is carried to her final resting place after she froze to death in a refugee camp in Kabul . Killed by the cold floor: Saiyma's father, Safarali, tried to wake his daughter, but she was not breathing. He said he was not able to afford a decent stove or the fuel . Saiyma’s father, Safarali Gadzai, crouched nearby. Inconsolable, he was supported physically and emotionally by her uncle. In between the sobbing and tears, he said: 'Yesterday she was OK. She had a little cough and I took her to the doctor. He gave us medicine. 'She even spoke children’s words to him. When she went to sleep she was fine. This morning, I went to check on her, she was under her blanket by the wood burner. 'I went to shake her awake and she was not breathing. I could not afford a decent wood stove or the fuel. The floor was too cold and this is what killed my daughter. She has taken her path and left us alone.' This is the nearest cemetery to the sprawling Characumba refugee camp and this routine is sadly common during the coldest months. As the hole nears completion, a tribal elder draws my attention to a fresh grave next to it. Inside lay a three-year-old boy called Janaan. Also from the camp, he like Saiyma, died in his sleep from exposure. Last goodbyes: Saiyma is tenderly wrapped in cloths and blankets ready for burial at a makeshift cemetery . Sombre: Pashtun men and women gather by the burial ground, the nearest cemetery to the sprawling Characumba refugee camp, where around 90 per cent of residents have fled from the fighting in Helmand . As the men completed the digging, two . dozen more gathered in lines to say prayers for the little girl before . gently lowering her into her tomb. A large piece of slate was placed over her shrouded remains before the . dirt and pebbles were returned to the earth. Finally the mound had two . upright stones placed at either end. A . cloth was tied between them to discourage birds from landing on the . grave. Animals are not welcome in the resting places of such deeply . superstitious people. We . gave Safarali and his brother a lift back to the camp. Upon arrival, we . navigated the narrow passageways in between the huts to reach the . Mosque. The recent snow . had melted quite suddenly turning the streets into sludge. Barely . distinguishable from the network of open sewers, that ran through their . centre. Temporary undertakers: Around half a dozen men used pick axes to dig the grave out of the icy groind on a frozen windswept hill just outside Kabul . Regrettable ritual: As the men completed the digging, two dozen more gathered in lines to say prayers for the little girl before gently lowering her into her tomb . The mud brick buildings of the camp have multiplied year after year since the first tents were pitched eight years ago. At present the Aschianna NGO estimates that over 1,000 families reside here. Local . people in Kabul treat them with suspicion. Unlike other internally . displaced Afghans, the people of Characumba are brought here directly by . the war rather than the more common land disputes. Ninety . percent of the residents come from Helmand province. The rest, from . Kandahar. Hailing from the sun burnt fields of the south these people . fair particularly badly in the bitter Kabul winter. As . we strode towards the heart of the camp, burka-clad women passed by us. Usually they would be out of sight hidden from view by deep-set . traditions. But today . Ashianna were operating their tent health clinic so sick children were . being brought there in their droves by anxious mothers. The . queue for the facility stretched back into the twisting lanes of the . city of mud. Other children congregated near two larger tents. Too common a sight: This routine is sadly a regular occurrence during the coldest months . Fleeing violence: Those attending the funeral live at the sprawling Characumba refugee camp, which currently accommodates around 1,000 families . There are around 460,000 displaced people in Afghanistan, according to the Save The Children charity. In Kabul alone, there are 55 informal camps, home to more than 30,000 people, including 5,208 families. An estimated 70 per cent of the Afghan population live in poverty. The camps in Kabul sprung up spontaneously when displaced people arrived in the capital looking for help, and are not formally run by any agency, although charities like Save the Children provide assistance. Children under five are most vulnerable to the cold, especially if they are already weakened by malnutrition and poor health. Last year, more than 40 children died from the cold in one month alone. Earlier they had attended lessons in two makeshift schools housed in marquees another service provided by Aschianna. The boys and girls of the camp get a basic education in strict segregation from each other. More composed now, Safarali poured us tea at the entrance to the Mosque. He was in his late 20s but looked much older. When . asked how his family came to be in Kabul, he replied: 'We are not here . for sightseeing. We left Helmand because of the fighting, also there was . no work and we have no land. 'If you carry an ID card and the Taliban stop you, they will claim that you are a spy for the government. 'If . the police find you without one, they will arrest you on suspicion of . being Taliban or al-Qaeda. I don’t care who is in charge whether the . government or the Taliban as long as we have peace.' Asked if he would return if the fighting ceased following the withdrawal of foreign troops in 2014, his answer was surprising. 'There . is no point in going back there,' he said. 'There is no work except . smuggling, or selling drugs, I cannot do this. Even the work here is . better.' Displaced: Unlike other internally displaced Afghans, the people of Characumba are brought here directly by the war rather than the more common land disputes . Superstition: Finally the mound had two upright stones placed at either end with a cloth tied between them to discourage birds from landing on the grave . Like most men from the displacement camps he relied on casual labouring work from the market places around Kabul, though work was rare and poorly paid. He said: 'Each morning I get up early and go to Hodkhail (a local labour market), If I find work, then I can earn around 200 afghanis ($4). 'It costs me one hundred to travel there and back so I am left with just one hundred to support my family. From this I must buy food, firewood, tea and medicine.' To add to the desperation of Safarali and other men in his position, much of the work would dry up when the snow arrived in the coming weeks. Building sites cannot operate when the roads are impassable, so their meagre income would wither just as the weather was at its cruellest. He concluded with a plea to the government: 'We have lived in this poverty now for five years. 'These living conditions are not suitable for animals. We are tired of moving around we demand and end to the war and a permanent place to live. 'They should be like our parents, instead they neglect us.' His brother snorted and added: 'They think we are stupid. We know that other countries are sending us money for the things we need. But they are stealing it from us. That is why my niece is dead.'","Saiyma Gadazai froze to death because father couldn't afford decent heater .

An animal rights campaigner was forced to abandon a protest outside KFC while dressed as a chicken as he was punched, rugby tackled and pelted with poultry. Olly Tyler arrived at his local branch in Wiltshire dressed in a bespoke £600 costume and planned to wave a placard outside for two days to deter customers. But within hours his feathers were ruffled when diners began hurling sachets of sauce, chicken wings and nuggets at him. Animal protest: Olly Tyler stood outside his local KFC in a 7ft chicken suit only to be pelted with food, punched and rugby tackled . Dedicated: Olly spent £600 on the bespoke costume paid for with money given because he did well in his GCSEs . One diner punched him in the head and two men jumped from their car and rugby tackled him to the ground. Violent: Olly was hit with sauces, chicken wings and nuggets in the attacks that made him too scared to return . The 16-year-old, was saved from injury thanks to his 7ft tall padded chicken suit, but was so shaken he has vowed not to return. However, he said despite the violence aimed at him he did not want to waste the police's time by asking them to investigate the attack. 'I was standing on a grass island outside the KFC so I was completely exposed. It was quite hard to see where the attacks were coming from because of the suit,' he said. 'I've protested outside this KFC before and I was pelted with three chicken wings but this time it was much worse. 'People threw sauce and chicken wings at me as well as chicken nuggets. When I left the ground was covered in them. 'One guy punched me in the head. It didn't hurt but I was really shocked. Twenty minutes later, two guys got out of their car and rugby tackled me to the ground. 'I have no idea why they did it. I think they just got caught in the hype.' Olly was given money from relatives after doing well in his GCSEs and used it to buy a £600 chicken suit, which was handmade in Paris. The teenager, who has won an award for his work from PETA, decided to protest outside KFC after reading an article claiming the factory hens are kept in horrific conditions. He stood outside the restaurant on Spitfire Retail Park on October 12 and spent seven hours receiving a 'positive reaction' from passers-by. Olly decided to return to make his stand on December 22 and 23 and planned to spend at least seven hours outside the fast food joint on both days. He added: 'I arrived at 10am and the KFC workers were already outside. They are never that nice to me but they don't do anything. Man of action: Olly has taken his welfare protest to Shell as well (left) and he was awarded a prize by PETA (right) for his work . 'The KFC is next to a McDonald's and they are lovely in there, they came out and offered me a meal but I had to turn it down because I'm a vegetarian. 'Most people were nice, they were beeping and waving at me but then it became dangerous. 'I wanted to spend all day there but I left by 2.45pm because I was worried for my safety. The area has no CCTV and I felt really vulnerable. 'I decided not to return the next day. When you are in a chicken costume you can't do anything to defend yourself.' Olly is currently supporting Greenpeace's Save the Arctic campaign and plans to protest in Bristol and Bath in the future. A spokesman for KFC insisted: 'At KFC, we are committed to poultry welfare and we use only reputable suppliers, that are the same as the UK's leading supermarkets and restaurants, which meet or exceed UK and EU regulations on quality and welfare.'","Olly Tyler, 16, was pelted with sauces, chicken wings and nuggets before being punched in the head and rugby tackled to the ground .

A Spanish teenager who killed a British mother and her two children in a road crash and left their father in a wheelchair, has been jailed for just three years. Sally Austin  and children Samuel, 13, and Claire, 11, died in the horrific smash on the island of Menorca, while husband Nicholas Austin suffered life-changing spinal injuries. They were killed after a head-on collision with another family of British holidaymakers who needed hospital treatment. Killed: Sally Austin and children Samuel, 13, and Claire, 11, died in the horrific smash on the island of Menorca, while husband Nicholas Austin suffered life-changing spinal injuries in 2007 . Mr Austin, 51 at the time, was initially thought to be at fault over the July 25 2006 accident on a road linking the island capital Mahon to the town of Ciutadella. But a police investigation revealed Spaniard David Fernandez had clipped the holidaymaker's hire car and forced him into the path of a another vehicle driven by the second Brit family after overtaking in heavy traffic. The local, 19 at the time, was found guilty of the manslaughter of Mrs Austin and her two children, from Billericay in Essex, through reckless driving, after a trial in Mahon. Smash: The trio were killed after a head-on collision with another family of British holidaymakers who needed hospital treatment . He was also convicted of injuring Mr Austin and fellow Brits Paul Blackwell, his wife Rebecca, their son Sebastian, then five, and their daughter Francisca, then two, from Warfield near Bracknell in Berkshire. Judges heard Fernandez, from Ciutadella in north west Majorca, had overtaken several times in heavy traffic in his souped-up Ford Probe in the run-up to the accident. An oncoming bus was forced onto the hard shoulder to avoid a head-on crash during a near-miss moments earlier. He hit Mr Austin's Ford Ka as he tried to slot back into his carriageway after overtaking several vehicles. Mr Austin only found out he lost his family after waking up in intensive care in hospital on the neighbouring island of Majorca several days after the crash. He suffered serious spinal injuries that left him unable to walk. Cause: A police investigation revealed Spaniard David Fernandez had clipped the holidaymaker's hire car and forced him into the path of a another vehicle driven by the second Brit family after overtaking in heavy traffic . His daughter was thrown nearly 100 feet out of the family's hire car from the force of the impact. Paramedics pulled her mother alive from the wreckage of the Ford Ka, which was almost cut in half by the impact of the collision, but she died shortly after. The Blackwells were nearing the end of a two-week holiday on Menorca. Mr Blackwell, a keen runner and regular churchgoer, suffered head injuries and spent time in intensive care. His wife and two children suffered minor cuts and bruises and were released from hospital after treatment. Mr Austin's elderly mother Beryl, speaking after the accident, said: 'We can't believe we have lost all three of them. 'My grandchildren were such wonderful children. 'We just have to hope now for our son.' A local fireman, describing the scene of the accident, added: 'We arrived to find the car in which the adult and two children died cut in half in the middle of the road. 'The woman was brought out alive but died minutes later. 'Her husband was beside her and although he was conscious, he wasn't able to take in the full impact of what had happened. 'The young boy was already dead in the back of the vehicle and his sister's body had been flung into a ditch about 25 metres from the car.' Fernandez, thought to have been travelling with a pregnant woman at the time of the crash, was also banned from driving for five years. He was ordered to pay Mr Austin nearly £310,000 in compensation. The jail sentence has already been ratified by a higher provincial court.","Sally Austin and children Samuel, 13, and Claire, 11, died in Menorca .

A former Moulin Rouge showgirl who enjoyed a lavish globe-trotting lifestyle was on the run yesterday after being exposed as a brazen benefits fraudster. Mother-of-two Dawn Orton, 47, had claimed incapacity benefit for an injured shoulder and for 13 years received welfare payments as a lone widow struggling to make ends meet. In reality she played badminton, enjoyed skiing trips and even went scuba diving with sharks while claiming to be disabled. Dawn Orton dressed to take the stage at the Moulin Rouge. The former dancer has been found guilty of benefit fraud . The supposedly poverty-stricken . single mother also failed to inform officials she was in a long-term . relationship with a company director who took her on 41 foreign trips in . 13 years. Orton kept her fraud secret from . partner Marc Lissimore, 47, who discovered the truth only after she left . him for an American yacht salesman in 2010 and he opened her mail to . find she was being pursued by the Department for Work and Pensions. She was prosecuted for defrauding . taxpayers out of £29,000, but the total value of her false claims may . have been as high as £100,000. Orton eloped with a new lover and refused to return to the UK for her trial at Hull Crown Court. She was convicted of benefits fraud . and sentenced in her absence to 12 months’ jail. An international . warrant has been issued for her arrest. Dawn Orton, 47, a benefit cheat, laughs as she arrives at court for a preliminary hearing in October. She was found guilty of failure to declare a change in circumstances . Glamour: Dawn Orton poses on the balcony of her holiday in Gran Canaria in 1998. Orton, who was in a relationship, claimed Widowed Mothers Allowance, which only single people are entitled to. Judge Jeremy Richardson QC said Orton . had written to inform the court she was on holiday in Spain and . suggested the hearing move to Gibraltar to accommodate her – a move he . branded ‘audacious’ and  ‘massively impertinent’. The court heard Orton was a dancer in her youth and worked all over Europe, including at the famous Moulin Rouge in Paris. She started claiming incapacity . benefit for a shoulder injury, but was able to play badminton at her . local club in Cottingham, East Yorkshire, during that time and also went . skiing, the court heard. She also bought a nearly new  Mercedes car, which the judge described as ‘even more audacious’. Exhibitionist: Orton poses by the Christmas lights in Cottingham in December 2002. The picture on the right shows her relaxing on holiday in Rhodes, Greece . Luxurious: Orton in front of the temple of Abu Simbel in Eygpt in 2005. She paid for the holidays with the money she scammed . After the death of her husband in 1996 . she switched her benefit to the higher Widowed Parents Allowance. To . receive the payment, currently £105 a week maximum, the claimant must . not be in a relationship, the court heard. Later that year she began a . relationship with Mr Lissimore, described by the judge as ‘akin to . marriage’, and failed to report her change of circumstances to the DWP. The judge said Orton had obtained at least £29,000 from public funds ‘which she was not entitled to’. This is based on the assumption that . her disability claim was genuine, and is the difference between the . widow’s allowance and incapacity benefit. Jet setter: On a flight to Lanzarote in 2004. She fled to Spain in late 2012 and is now the subject of an international arrest warrant . Performer: Orton was a professional dancer and appeared at venues all over the world, including the famous Moulin Rouge in Paris . However, if the judge’s ‘suspicion’ had been proved that Orton was also never entitled to incapacity . benefit, the total value of her fraud would have been about £100,000. Orton lived with Mr Lissimore in a . £280,000 five-bedroom house in Cottingham and they also bought a craft . shop together where she worked part-time. Speaking outside court, Mr Lissimore . said he had lost £130,000 in a financial agreement with Orton over their . split. ‘I couldn’t believe it when I found out she had been claiming . all this money,’ he said. ‘Her whole life has been about greed.’ Orton was not in touch with her sons Reece, 19, and CJ, 22, he said. Orton now faces an investigation under the Proceeds of Crime Act to claim back the ill-gotten gains.","Dawn Orton, 47, had claimed incapacity benefit for an injured shoulder .

Dishonest: Alan Lawson, 58, was jailed after claiming nearly £90,000 in benefits because of a crippling back injury while working as a fitness instructor . A benefit cheat who claimed he was unemployed and could barely walk was caught working as a council fitness instructor and teaching people how to lift weights. Alan Lawson, 58, raked in nearly £90,000 over more than eight years claiming he suffered severe back and leg pain. But he was jailed for eight months after investigators discovered he was working at Newton Aycliffe sports centre in County Durham and was instructing new members how to use weights. Lawson, . of Newgate Street, Bishop Auckland,admitted benefit fraud totalling . £88,008. Durham Crown Court heard how he had to have back surgery in 1995 following an . accident and had started claiming incapacity benefit legitimately. He said he was unable to walk without . the aid of a stick and could barely make it 100 yards without having to . stop. But he admitted failing to notify the Department for Work and Pensions of an improvement in his condition. Susan Hirst, prosecuting, said: 'He . said he was unable to walk without a stick, and suffered severe back and . leg pain after walking just a short distance. 'On a good day he said he could walk 100 yards if he stopped every 20 yards or so. 'He said he needed help getting out of bed, washing and dressing, plus other aspects of personal care.' Locked up: Recorder Alistair MacDonald jailed Lawson for eight months at Durham Crown Court telling him he had became 'ingrained in dishonesty' Miss Hirst said from September 2010 he also claimed housing and council tax benefit, as he was supposedly unemployed. But, inquiries began after it emerged he had been working as a fitness instructor at the sports centresince October 2003. Caught Out: Investigators found Lawson working as a gym instructor at Newton Aycliffe sports centre in County Durham last year . Miss Hirst added: 'He was earning . £200 a week, but he didn't declare it, or that his physical condition . improved, to either the DWP or to the county council.' 'He . began working part-time to see if he could do the work. The hours . increased and he said the years simply went by and he didn't report it.' Ian West, defending, said: 'He's admitted he was wrong in continuing these claims. Effectively, he 'slid' into this offending. 'The accident left him unable to work, severely disabled and walking with two sticks. 'It was a big lifestyle change for him and, some in his position might have given up, and accepted life on benefits. 'He . got physiotherapy and acupuncture and it worked. His physical fitness . got back to a position where he hoped he could get back to the world of . work. 'He started by getting qualifications and doing fitness training. 'He . was never as fit as before, but he was able to go back to work . part-time and was trying to see if he could ease himself back into . full-time work.' Mr West said Lawson only had to be able to instruct gym users how to use the equipment, but wasn't lifting weights himself. Jailing him, Recorder Alistair MacDonald QC, told Lawson: 'It's ironic you say you battled back to some form of fitness. 'You said you didn't have to be as fit as your potential clients. You became ingrained in this dishonesty. 'Many . people are forced out of work but do not claim benefits to which they . are not entitled. Every penny obtained fraudulently by you is a penny . legitimately paid by taxpayers.' Following the sentencing, a spokesperson for Durham County Council said: 'Alan Lawson no longer works for Durham County Council. 'The council takes benefit fraud very seriously and we investigate and assist with any investigations where any member of staff is suspected of falsely claiming benefits.' John Carter, from the DWP, said: 'No-one should think they can get away with benefit theft. 'Our investigators track down those guilty of stealing money they are not entitled to, bringing them before the courts and making them face the consequences of their action. 'In addition to any sentence imposed by the court, the department always seeks to recover the money falsely obtained, to ensure that cheats do not benefit from their criminal activities.'","Alan Lawson, 58, said he could only walk with help of a stick .

"By . Claire Bates . PUBLISHED: . 07:29 EST, 8 January 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 07:29 EST, 8 January 2013 . A debt-ridden NHS trust which was on the brink of bankruptcy should be dissolved, an official consultation has concluded. South London Healthcare NHS Trust, which runs three hospitals in the capital, was the first ever to be placed in administration after it started losing around £1.3 million a week. Special administrator Matthew Kershaw said the trust should now be broken up, with other organisations taking over the management and delivery of its services. The South London Healthcare Trust, which runs three hospitals including Queen Elizabeth in Woolwich (pictured), could be broken up . The . Trust was only created in 2009 after the merger of three hospitals - . the Princess Royal in Orpington, Queen Mary's in Sidcup and the Queen . Elizabeth in Woolwich. The report, which came after Mr Kershaw was tasked with putting the trust on a stable financial footing last year, recommended any debts should be written off by the Department of Health so new organisations are not 'saddled with the issues of the past'. Its recommendations would result in a radical overhaul of services in south London. This would see the Queen Elizabeth Hospital site in Woolwich come together with Lewisham Healthcare NHS Trust to create a new organisation providing care for the communities of Greenwich and Lewisham. The Princess Royal University Hospital in Farnborough, near Bromley, would be acquired by King’s College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust. Matthew Kershaw was tasked with putting the trust on a stable financial footing last year . The report stated: 'In order to deliver this transformation programme, South London Healthcare NHS Trust should be dissolved and other organisations should take over the management and delivery of the NHS services it currently provides.' Mr Kershaw said South London Healthcare NHS Trust (SLHT) remained the “biggest financial problem” across the NHS. According to his report - which was presented after no “viable alternatives” were put forward - its hospitals will need to make £74.9 million of efficiency savings over the next three years. Mr Kershaw added: 'I have said consistently that the status quo is not an option, and I believe these final, refined recommendations are the right ones, although I appreciate that some people will find them difficult to accept. 'I do believe that, if implemented fully, they will help deliver safe, high-quality, affordable and sustainable services for the people of south east London into the future.' Dr Jane Fryer, medical director for NHS South East London and medical adviser to the programme, said: 'As a practising GP in south east London for 24 years, I believe the recommendations in this final report will ensure our patients receive safe, high- quality care which will simply not be possible if the situation here continues and no changes are made. 'Making changes to emergency, maternity and planned care over the next three years, alongside the important improvements we need in primary care and community services, will deliver a transformation in the NHS locally - a service saving lives and improving health outcomes. 'Clearly, not all clinicians agree with our proposals, but overall I believe by implementing them we can transform the way the NHS delivers services in south east London, improving care for all in a long-term, sustainable way.' The final report has been presented to the Health Secretary who has 20 working days to review its recommendations and make a decision on the future of the NHS in south east London by February 1.","South London Healthcare Trust runs three hospitals in London and was placed in administration last year .

Brave: The 77-year-old woman chased Keith Williams down the stairs and grabbed hold of him after she caught him in her home . A violent burglar was traced with the help of a button that a courageous grandmother tore from his jeans. The 77-year-old woman chased Keith Williams down the stairs of her suburban Manchester home and grabbed hold of him after she caught him raiding the house. The thug punched her in the face, but a button fell off his jeans in the struggle before he managed to flee. Williams, of Manchester, was arrested after fingerprints revealed he had been at the scene of the crime, and the jeans with the missing button were found at the address where he was staying. The 41-year-old - who has 97 offences stretching back 30 years on his record - was jailed for 32 months at Manchester Crown Court after admitting to the burglary. The court heard that his last three offences have all involved violent confrontations with women in their seventies. In the most recent offence, Williams walked through the unlocked door of the victim's home as she put out her recycling bin on the afternoon of September 18. When she went back into the house, she heard a noise from upstairs, and found Williams standing in the doorway of a bedroom. He pushed her away when she grabbed him, but the brave pensioner followed him downstairs and took hold of him again. But Williams managed to escape, fleeing with £78 and a locket containing a picture of the victim's grandchildren. In a statement, the woman, who suffered pain, bruising, anxiety and sleeplessness after her ordeal, told police: 'I feel sick that this has taken place, I'm very angry. The money was to pay for the gas bill, we'd had to save for that.' Trail: Williams was jailed for 32 months at Manchester Crown Court after being found in possession of the jeans with the missing button, which had fallen off in his struggle with the grandmother . When he was charged days after the offence, Williams told officers: 'I'm going to murder the lot of you. I'm going to murder the judges and everyone.' Andrew Smith said Williams, who shouted denials from the dock during the sentence hearing, was a paranoid schizophrenic, adding that outbursts were a symptom of his condition. He said that the 41-year-old, who had a history of hard drug abuse, had apologised to the victim for the 'opportunistic' offence, and hoped to better his life with the help of medication and family support. Sentencing, Judge Michael Henshell said the offence had left the victim 'frightened in her own home'. Jailing Williams for 32 months, he said: 'It's perfectly obvious you are a person, whatever the state of your mental health, who has a capacity for being violent to people, and you have been violent to elderly people as well.'","She chased him down the stairs and grabbed hold of him .

A man in Massachusetts says all he heard was a hiss before a bobcat pounced on him in his own garage, sinking its teeth into his face and its claws in his back. Roger Mundell Jr, 53, went into the garage in Brookfield on Sunday morning to fetch some tie-down straps for a friend when the rabid animal attacked. It then ran out of the garage and bit Mundell's 15-year-old nephew on the arms and back. Mundell and his wife pinned the cat to the ground and shot it dead. Scroll down for video . 'Bleeding like crazy': Roger Mundell Jr. was scratched on his face and back after being attacked by a rabid bobcat in his own garage . Mundell, his nephew and his wife, are being treated for rabies. His wife wasn't bitten, but got the animal's blood on her hands. State Environmental Police took the bobcat to have it tested for rabies, which they think is likely given its unusual behavior. Test results are not yet available. 'It was on me in a split second,' Mundell told the Boston Globe on Sunday. 'I have bite marks in my eyelid, up my forehead. It scratched my back. I was bleeding like crazy.' While bobcats are a common sight in Massachusetts, the timid animals usually avoid humans and it is highly unusual that they attack people. Fierce? Bobcats grow to around twice the size of domestic house cats but are elusive animals and usually avoid human contact . Shock and awe: The victim claims that he only heard a hiss before being attacked in his garage . Tom French, of the state Division of Fisheries and Wildlife, said: 'This is completely out of character for a bobcat, even to be in the garage in the first place. It is completely consistent with an animal that may have rabies.' Mundell told the Boston Globe that he was glad that it was him rather than his wife or teenage nephew that was attacked. 'It would have killed my wife. I know it would have,' he said. After being taken by surprise by the bobcat, Mundell managed to throw his jacket - with the animal attached - over his head and make a run for the garage door. But as Mundell emerged into the drive to warn his nephew, the animal reappeared and bit the teenager. Mundell's wife had run into the house for a gun. As the couple held the cat down, Mundell shot the animal twice. 'I used everything I had to do it,' he said. 'You don’t test it, you do it.' Bobcat numbers are growing nationwide and especially in Massachusetts. But exact figures are difficult to calculate due to the animal's elusive nature. The animal is approximately twice the size of a domestic house cat and can be easily identified by its short, 'bobbed' tail, prominent face ruff, and slightly tufted ears. Self-defense: Robert Mundell and his wife pinned the bobcat down and shot it twice in the head. They were then treated for rabies .

'I would never have become involved in something like this but the lives of my children were in danger and I felt I had to protect them.' Prosecutors in the Bali court have already said they are seeking a 15-year prison term, a lesser sentence than the maximum penalty for drug trafficking which is death. During the hearing today Mrs Sandiford's lawyer read out a statement from her son which said: 'I love my mother very much and have a very close relationship with her.

Target: The UKBA's HQ at Lunar House in Croydon (pictured) would be best protected from terrorism with giant flower pots . A Government department has decided that flower power is the best way to defend itself against terrorist attacks - so it wants to surround its headquarters with giant plant pots. The UK Border Agency plans to encircle Lunar House in Croydon with 27 giant concrete flower beds so it can stop a car filled with explosives smashing into it. These massive plant pots would be 'placed strategically' around the 20-storey HQ for 'security purposes' while having a 'positive effect' visually, its planning application to the local council says. The giant concrete 'borders', which are one-metre tall and two-metres wide, would stop terrorists attacking the building, which deals with tens of thousands of applications by asylum seekers every year. The new 'floral displays' will replace a series of unsightly concrete blocks put in place by the UKBA five years ago, at a cost of £10,000. 'The Home Office have instructed (planning agents) to submit a planning application, which seeks approval for the development of 27 planters outside Lunar House for security purposes,' the planning application says. 'They will increase the level of protection from security threats.' The planning application states that the plant pots will be made from dark grey polished concrete and that they will be 'robust' and expected to 'deter security threats whilst enhancing the visual amenity of the building and local area'. How it would look: Their planning application uses this image to show how the flower beds would be pleasant to see and be the first line of defence in a bomb attack . The application continues: 'Due to the nature and scale of the proposed security planters, it is considered they will have a positive impact on the surrounding area. 'The proposals adhere to the policy aspirations for the site as they protect and enhance the Home Office's existing operations on the site.' The UKBA says it is acting on Home Office guidance regarding security measures at the building. A spokesman for the Home Office, which runs the UKBA, said today: 'We don't comment on the measures we take for security reasons so that people who might wish to do us harm are not aware of why we are taking steps to secure buildings.' Busy: Lunar House is visited by thousands of asylum seekers a year who are applying to stay in Britain . Croydon resident Sam Harris, 41, said: 'Lunar House is unsightly as it is and I don't see how sticking a few flowers around it is going to help. 'The cost must be in the tens of thousands to get 27 of these things in, and if someone really wants to bomb the place I don't think a few plants will stop them.' Planning chiefs at Croydon Council are set to make a decision on the giant plants pots in February.","Giant flower beds will look nice and protect Lunar House from terrorists, Home Office says .

"By . Reuters Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 13:48 EST, 7 January 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 13:48 EST, 7 January 2013 . Officials recently found switches produced by H3C Technologies in the network infrastructure of a leading U.S. nuclear weapons lab . A leading U.S. nuclear weapons laboratory recently discovered its computer systems contained Chinese-made network switches and replaced at least two components because of national security concerns, a document shows. A letter from the Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico, dated November 5, 2012, states that the research facility installed devices made by H3C Technologies Co., based in Hangzhou, China, according to a copy seen by Reuters. H3C began as a joint venture between China's Huawei Technologies Co. and 3Com Corp., a U.S. tech firm, and was once called Huawei-3Com. Hewlett Packard Co. acquired the firm in 2010. The discovery raises concerns about procurement practices by U.S. departments responsible for national security. The U.S. government and Congress have raised concerns about Huawei and its alleged ties to the Chinese military and government. The company, the world's second-largest telecommunications equipment maker, denies its products pose any security risk or that the Chinese military influences its business. H3C Technologies was formed as joint-venture between Huawei Technologies, a Chinese company previously barred from owning an American corporation because of the risk to America's national security . Under Scrutiny: House Intelligence Committee Chairman Mike Rogers, R-Mich., left, discuss a year-long probe of China's two leading tech firms, Huawei Technologies Ltd. and ZTE Corp . The Intelligence Committee's ranking Democrat, Rep. C.A. ""Dutch"" Ruppersberger, (pictured on right) talks about a report that says, among things, that Huawe Technologies, 'cannot be trusted' Switches are used to manage data traffic on computer networks. The exact number of Chinese-made switches installed at Los Alamos, how or when they were acquired, and whether they were placed in sensitive systems or pose any security risks, remains unclear. The laboratory - where the first atomic bomb was designed - is responsible for maintaining America's arsenal of nuclear weapons. A spokesman for the Los Alamos lab referred inquiries to the Department of Energy's National Nuclear Security Administration, or NNSA, which declined to comment. No Risk: Huawei's vice president of external affairs William Plummer has argued that H3C products contain no security risks to the United States . The November 5 letter seen by Reuters was written by the acting chief information officer at the Los Alamos lab and addressed to the NNSA's assistant manager for safeguards and security. It states that in October a network engineer at the lab - who the letter does not identify - alerted officials that H3C devices 'were beginning to be installed in' its networks. The letter says a working group of specialists, some from the lab's counter intelligence unit, began investigating, 'focusing on sensitive networks.' The lab 'determined that a small number of the devices installed in one network were H3C devices. Two devices used in isolated cases were promptly replaced,' the letter states. The letter suggests other H3C devices may still be installed. It states that the lab was investigating 'replacing any remaining H3C network switch devices as quickly as possible,' including 'older switches' in ""both sensitive and unclassified networks as part of the normal life-cycle maintenance effort.' The letter adds that the lab was conducting a formal assessment to determine 'any potential risk associated with any H3C devices that may remain in service until replacements can be obtained.' 'We would like to emphasize that (Los Alamos) has taken this issue seriously, and implemented expeditious and proactive steps to address it,' the letter states. On the Record: Plummer speaks to reporters after a House Intelligence Committee meeting concerning the Committee's report on the security threat posed by Chinese telecom companies to U.S. national security . Corporate filings show Huawei sold its stake in H3C to 3Com in 2007. Nevertheless, H3C's website still describes Huawei as one of its 'global strategic partners' and states it is working with it 'to deliver advanced, cost-efficient and environmental-friendly products.' The Los Alamos letter appears to have been written in response to a request last year by the House Armed Services Committee for the Department of Energy (DoE) to report on any 'supply chain risks.' In its request, the committee said it was concerned by a Government Accountability Office report last year that found a number of national security-related departments had not taken appropriate measures to guard against risks posed by their computer-equipment suppliers. The report said federal agencies are not required to track whether any of their telecoms networks contain foreign-developed products. The House Armed Services committee (pictured) has asked the Department of Energy to evaluate whether it, or any of its major contractors, were using technology produced by Huawei . The Armed Services committee specifically asked the DoE to evaluate whether it, or any of its major contractors, were using technology produced by Huawei or ZTE Corp, another Chinese telecoms equipment maker. ZTE Corp denies its products pose any security risk. In 2008, Huawei and private equity firm Bain Capital were forced to give up their bid for 3Com after a U.S. panel rejected the deal because of national security concerns. Three years later, Huawei abandoned its acquisition of some assets from U.S. server technology firm 3Leaf, bowing to pressure from the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States. The committee evaluates whether foreign control of a U.S. business poses national security risks. Much at Risk: The Chinese-made switches were discovered in the network infrastructure of Los Alamos National Laboratory, which manages America's arsenal of nuclear weapons . In October, the House Intelligence Committee issued an investigative report that recommended U.S. government systems should not include Huawei or ZTE components. The report said that based on classified and unclassified information, Huawei and ZTE 'cannot be trusted to be free of foreign state influence' and pose 'a security threat to the United States and to our systems.' William Plummer, Huawei's vice president of external affairs in Washington, said in an email to Reuters: 'There has never been a shred of substantive proof that Huawei gear is any less secure than that of our competitors, all of which rely on common global standards, supply chains, coding and manufacturing. 'Blackballing legitimate multinationals based on country of origin is reckless, both in terms of fostering a dangerously false sense of cyber-security and in threatening the free and fair global trading system that the U.S. has championed for the last 60-plus years.' He referred questions about H3C products to Hewlett Packard. An HP spokesman said Huawei no longer designs any H3C hardware and that the company 'became independent operationally ... from Huawei' several years prior to HP's acquisition of it. He added that HP's networking division ""has considerable resources dedicated to compliance with all legal and regulatory requirements involving system security, global trade and customer privacy.""","So-called network switches are used to manage data traffic on computer networks .

Prosecutors said Hayden thought his estranged girlfriend and mother of his four children, 27-year-old Renee Sandora, was having an affair with Mills, Hayden's long-time friend. Hayden's attorney told jurors that DNA from a bullet and shell casing point to someone other than his client. Prosecutors described Hayden as a drug addict and an extremely jealous man who would hide in the woods across from Miss Sandora's house and try to catch her cheating on him. He reportedly accused neighbors and friends of cheating with her. Tragic end: Joel Hayden and Renee Sandora had four children together before he allegedly killed his ex-girlfriend .

Moments later the mother-of-four made a 911 call from her cellphone. She told the responder that 'her boyfriend' had just shot her. The prosecution then alleges that the boy watched as his father shot his mother in the head at close-range.

Sickening attack: Luke Harwood, 18, was severely beaten at his bedsit before being driven to a field and 'finished off', the court heard . A woman led a vigilante gang who tortured an 18-year-old to death after he was accused of rape, the Old Bailey heard. Emma Hall, 21, helped three men kill Luke Harwood in Romford, Essex, after an 18-year-old girl claimed he had attacked her two years earlier, the court was told. Mr Harwood was kicked and stamped on with such force that the bones in his face were broken, before he was dumped under a mattress in a quiet lane, the Old Bailey heard. The 'victim' had made a complaint about Mr Harwood to the police two years earlier, when she was 16, but the matter was dropped when she withdrew the allegation, jurors learned. Police investigated but found that 'it was clear she was not in fact saying that he had raped her and no further action was taken against him'. The girl pointed Mr Harwood out to his killers at a chance meeting at a house on the evening of May 27 last year, said prosecutor Simon Denison QC. 'She told the others that he was the person she had told [Hall] about at the time, who had raped her,' added Mr Denison. James Danby, 27, and Jovan Roberts, 28, took pictures of Mr Harwood in his council bedsit to show to her. Minutes later, they attacked him in his room, the court heard. Mr Harwood, who was 5ft 7in and weighed just seven stone, had just collected his keys and begun moving in after falling out with his girlfriend. The father of one, who had an eight-month-old son, was then brutally beaten by Danby, Roberts and Hall's boyfriend Tony O’Toole, 29, the prosecutor said. Mr Denison said: ‘Within a very few hours of those photographs being taken he was dead. He was about to be severely beaten up and brutally killed.’ 'The men, over a prolonged period of time, severely beat him up by punching and kicking him to the head, so he was bleeding heavily from his injuries and his face was terribly swollen.' Hall cackled throughout the two-hour assault, the court heard. She later allegedly drove two of the men and Mr . Harwood to a quiet lane in Woodford Green, east London, in her blue Fiat Punto, where he was taken to . the bank of a stream and 'finished off'. Once there, Danby tried to choke Mr Harwood, but when he put up a fight he stamped on his head 20 times. He later boasted the victim's head 'went like a marshmallow and popped where his brain came out', jurors were told. Hall initially claimed Danby had been solely responsible for the fatal . attack, in a bid to save herself and her lover O'Toole, it is alleged. Violent murder: Emma Hall, 21, helped three men kill Mr Harwood and hide his body under a mattress, the Old Bailey heard . But her lies unravelled when officers went to the house and found the younger girl alone and petrified. Mr Denison added: 'At one point Danby brought Luke into Emma Hall's room to show them what they had done to him. 'They could see his face was a mess, his nose looked broken and there was blood and bruises all over his face.' When they returned from killing Mr Harwood and dumping his body, the attackers were laughing and joking, the court was told. Mr Denison said: 'They killed him by punching and kicking him and stamping on his head many, many times. The bones in his face were crushed.' He said the gang then bought petrol and set fire to their bloody clothing, before cleaning up bloodstains at the house. The following evening, Hall drove two of the attackers and two other men to the spot where the body had been covered with a mattress and other rubbish, the court heard. Mr Denison said: 'They had with them knives and a pair of bolt cutters that they were intending to use to mutilate his body to make it more difficult for him to be identified by cutting off his fingers and removing his teeth.' But Hall had secretly tipped off police, who were waiting for them when they arrived, said . Mr Denison told the jury: 'His murder was quite extraordinarily callous, violent and brutal.' Hall, Danby, O’Toole, and Roberts deny murder and causing grievous bodily harm with intent. Hall, Danby, O’Toole, Billy Duggan, 21, and Khalid Hassan, 20, deny conspiracy to pervert the course of justice. All the defendants are from Romford. The trial continues.

Britains's largest medical insurer Bupa is forcing customers to use cut-price consultants, it is claimed. Restrictions brought in by the private health firm and being considered by other insurers mean patients can see only physicians on an approved list – who charge lower rates. Nine out of ten consultants say the list gives patients less or no choice and they could get worse treatment as a result. Britain's largest medical insurer Bupa is forcing customers to use cut-price consultants (file picture) The move could also leave Bupa legally liable to any of its policyholders who believe they have been badly treated as a result, according to a top QC. Barrister Tom Weitzman, a specialist on insurance law, said the company must ensure its ‘approved’ consultants had specialist skills. If a patient is injured because the doctor did not have ‘requisite skills’ for the treatment, Bupa ‘will be liable,’ he said. Typically, patients with private cover who want to see a consultant visit their GP for a referral, but caps on the cost may result in them paying top-ups. But Bupa has removed some experienced – and expensive – consultants from its approved list, with members no longer able to see them even if they pay the shortfall. Patients with private cover who want to see a consultant visit their GP for a referral, but caps on the cost may result in them paying top-ups . It has also slashed the amount it will pay for common procedures, from hip replacements to hysterectomies, by between four and  63 per cent. A survey by GfK  NOP on behalf of medical  insurer WPA – which also commissioned Mr Weitzman’s opinion – shows 96 per cent of consultants believe an approved list means patients have no choice or less than at present. And 87 per cent of the 1,000 surveyed believe patients would get worse or less effective treatment by using the approved list. Premiums across all private medical insurers have jumped 52 per cent in the past decade to an average of £1,070 a year, according to analysts Laing & Buisson. The Private Patients’ Forum said: ‘Discovering your cover does not extend to things you believed were entitlements is dreadful, especially when this news arrives when you have had an unwelcome diagnosis.’ Industry estimates say Bupa has lost 200,000 policyholders since the changes came in last year. One consultant in the WPA survey said: ‘Some private insurers – in particular Bupa – want to treat their customers like second-class NHS patients.’ Julian Stainton, chief executive of WPA, said patients and consultants were clearly against approved lists. He added: ‘We are never going down this road. Patients pay for private health insurance out of taxed income. If they don’t get consultant choice, what is the point?’ Dr Katrina Herren, medical director at Bupa Health and Wellbeing, said there are more than 10,000 consultants on its open referral list, and members get a choice of two or more. She added: ‘When surveyed, 90 per cent of our Open Referral  customers said that they were happy with the service.’","Nine out of ten consultants say list gives patients less or no choice .

"By . Hugo Gye . PUBLISHED: . 04:38 EST, 8 January 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 06:31 EST, 8 January 2013 . The company that runs Britain's train network today announced plans to invest £37.5billion on upgrading and expanding the country's railways. Network Rail intends to provide 170,000 extra seats for commuters at peak times by 2019. But with 225million more passengers expected to be travelling by that time, the firm said it would not make any attempt to crack down on trains running late. And there have been warnings that the plan will require a massive new injection of taxpayer funding and lead to even more inflation-busting fare hikes. Expansion: New plans to upgrade Britain's train systems have been announced by Network Rail . The NR plans come at a time of passenger fury at the 4.2 per cent rise in the average price of season tickets which took effect this month, as public anger has grown at the lavish salaries and bonuses enjoyed by train bosses. The organisation's chief executive warned that the industry had entered 'the era of trade-offs' as it faced pressure to cut costs, and said fares may have to rise again to pay the bill for the latest expansion. 'Increasingly we have to balance the need to build more infrastructure, run trains on time and cut costs, and in many areas choices will need to be made,' Sir David Higgins said. The NR plans - which must be approved by the Office of Rail Regulation to take effect - cover the period 2014-19. They envisage 225million more passengers per year travelling and 355,000 more trains in service - the highest numbers ever. 20 per cent extra morning peak seats into central London will be provided, along with 32 per cent more into large regional cities in England and Wales. Hotspots: This map shows the main lines and stations which will benefit from the Network Rail programme . Tight squeeze: NR hopes to introduce 170,000 extra seats on the morning commute . 700 more trains a day will link key northern cities, with a 10-minute reduction in journey time between Manchester and Leeds. Carbon dioxide emissions per passenger will be reduced by 37 per cent, while the network of more than 800 signal boxes is intended to be streamlined into just 14 major operations centres. Overall, NR hopes to reduce the cost of running Britain's railways by 18 per cent, and cut annual public subsidy to between £2.6billion and £2.9billion in 2019 - down from £4.5billion in 2009 and £7billion in 2004. Projects include various electrification schemes, including the Great Western and Midland Main Lines, station improvements at Birmingham and Reading, and reopening 31 miles of railways in Scotland closed under the Beeching cuts of 50 years ago. Compromise: Chief executive Sir David Higgins has warned a funding squeeze will lead to cutbacks . While the company has failed to meet its current target of 92.5 per cent punctuality for the current period, it insists that the goal will be achieved by the end of 2019. But even with extra trains and seats this will 'not be enough' on the busy West Coast Main Line, according to NR, which insists the added capacity of the London to Birmingham high-speed rail line is 'essential'. Sir David said: 'One million more trains run every year than 10 years ago, more passengers arrive on time than ever before, our safety record is one of the best in Europe and, despite the daily challenges we face, customer satisfaction is at record levels. 'Successive governments have made this possible by looking beyond the short term and recognising the critical importance of the railway to Britain's future.' Bob Crow, general secretary of the Rail Maritime and Transport union, said: 'While we support any plans to expand and invest in Britain's railways, you cannot seriously expect to safely increase capacity while at the same time the Government is looking to axe key frontline staff on trains, track and stations.' 'If the Government press on with the jobs cuts plans, they will simply be cramming more and more people into an overcrowded and unreliable service where safety is compromised and the profits of the private train operators are prioritised. That is simply a recipe for disaster.' Office of Rail Regulation (ORR) chief executive Richard Price said: 'Ministers have shown huge faith in what the railways can add to Britain's society and economy, committing to around £20 billion-worth of public money at a time when there is little money to go around. 'Key to maintaining rail's success will be openly justifying this significant commitment of public money. Taxpayers significantly fund the railways, and have every right see where this money is being spent.' Manuel Cortes, leader of the TSSA rail union, warned ministers against big annual fare hikes to pay for rail expansion. He said: 'We obviously back rail investment to improve the service but passengers have already suffered enough pain with a decade of annual inflation-plus fare increases. 'They should not now be expected to face another six years of even higher fares.'","Passengers could face fare hikes as plans for system expansion revealed .

Yankees manager Brian Cashman has been accused of leading a 'triple life', conducting an affair with at least two different women while he was still married and bragging to one of them during a drunken tryst: 'The Yankees control the universe and I control the Yankees.' Caroline Meanwell, the mother of Louise Neathway - one of Cashman's alleged mistresses - filed an explosive lawsuit in Manhattan Supreme Court yesterday accusing the baseball manager of being a 'manchild' who conspired to have his former lover committed so the . affair would never be revealed. The explosive suit also accuses Cashman of using scare tactics to force Meanwell into helping him, his lawyer and her daughter's therapist - who are referred to as 'The Gang' - and to turn against Neathway with the sole purpose of discrediting her. 'The Gang’s plan, while shocking and . outrageous, seemed to be concocted and executed by the Three Stooges . rather than a physician, a law firm and a sports executive,' the suit . claims. Louise Neathway, pictured right in court, claimed that Yankess boss . Brian Cashman, left, got her pregnant and made her have an abortion. He tried to discredit her by having her committed, a lawsuit says . Case: Caroline Meanwell, left, filed a lawsuit in Manhattan Supreme Court yesterday accusing Cashman of being a 'manchild' who conspired to have Louise Neathway, right, committed so the affair would never be revealed . Having a giggle: This surveillance image allegedly shows Cashman and Neathway, couple at left, enjoying food and drinks together just . twelve days before he had her arrested on stalking and harassment charges . Cashman's attorney Eric Creizman told . Meanwell that the only three options left for her daughter were that, 'She . will be committed, she will be arrested' or 'she will commit suicide and end . up dead.' The suit alleges that Creizman put the . emphasis on 'and end up dead' as an ominous warning so that Meanwell . would cooperate with them. They are then accused of giving her a script to read to a 911 dispatcher so police would be . sent to Neathway’s Tribeca apartment to institutionalize her. The call was deemed unnecessary by all first responders. The suit also claims that Cashman was . at one stage leading a 'triple life', and Louise Neathway, 36, ended her months-long . affair with him when she learned there was at least one other woman and that he had . no intention of divorcing his wife. The suit says: 'When it became . apparent Louise no longer wished to continue in a relationship with him, . Cashman started on a quest to destroy her reputation.' Cashman’s wife, Mary, filed for divorce soon after Neathway was arrested in February 2011. They came to an amicable agreement and settlement last year. The suit charges: 'His adulterous behavior turned his . whole world upside-down. In the United Kingdom, . such behavior of Cashman would fall under the old English term of . ""Manchild"" - a male adult who in a child-like way attempts to skirt . responsibility for his own malfeasance while blaming others.'

'One evening Cashman, after several . glasses of wine, nuzzled up to Louise on her rooftop and in a seductive . manner, whispered in her ear...that the Yankees control the universe and . that he controls the Yankees and that he would help her custody . battle.' Lawyer: Eric Creizman ominously warned Caroline Meanwell that Louise would 'end up dead', according to the suit . On . January 27, 2012, during a predawn call to Meanwell, Cashman - who is described in the suit as 'petulant . and frenzied' - allegedly admitted he had hacked into his former lover's . email account and tried to convince the mother he had nothing more than a . 'one-night stand' with Louise . It was only after this call - which left Meanwell a 'nervous wreck' - she agreed to go to the office of Eric Creizman to meet 'The Gang'. While there, Cashman admitted he had spoken with Louise's psychiatrist Charlotte Murphy numerous . times, who agreed she was a danger to herself. Murphy allegedly verified . this on the phone during that meeting. It was then that they, and another lawyer Caroline Polosi, provided Meanwell with a pre-written script to recite to the 911 operator. When first responders found Louise to . be no danger to herself or others, Creizman changed tactics and tried to . persuade Meanwell to involuntarily institutionalize her daughter, . according to the suit. When this failed, the Yankee's boss allegedly turned his attention towards having Neathway arrested. 'Cashman was not pleased with Creizman's unsuccessful stewardship in the attempted ""take down"" of Louise. 'He upped the ante and now was seeking to have her incarcerated', the suit says. Louise was then arrested in February of last year and charged with grand larceny, stalking and harassment. Prosecutors accused her of harassing Cashman with hundreds of . text messages, and demanding he give her $15,000 to pay for an . unspecified medical procedure. Neathway later claimed that she was pregnant with his child and that he told her to have an abortion. Cashman, Creizman and Charlotte Murphy did not respond to requests by MailOnline for comment. Jailed: Louise was then arrested in February of last year and charged with grand larceny, stalking and harassment as prosecutors accused her of harassing Cashman with hundreds of text messages, and demanding he give money from him . Meanwell's lawyer: Peter Gleason, who filed the suit, said Cashman wanted to discredit his former lover before the affair was revealed . Around the time of her arrest, the . New York Daily News also obtained a reference letter Cashman wrote for . Neathway on Yankees letterhead. In . the letter dated July 15, 2011, Cashman said that he had known her for . six years through charity work and described her as 'tireless' contributor who had the 'respect and admiration' of her colleagues. In court, Neathway's lawyers said Mr Cashman was 'a . married man having an inappropriate relationship' with Neathway, a . medical sales worker, and he . turned on her when it ended badly'. She . is also reported by the Post to have claimed to several friends that . she had a year-long affair with the Yankees boss, which she ended after he did not . fulfill the promise to leave his wife and when she found out there were other women. Louise was subsequently released from Rikers Island prison in July after her mother paid the $300,000 bond package. Under the terms of her release, she must wear an ankle monitor and live at her mother’s home in Hunterdon County, New Jersey. Caroline Meanwell's lawyer Peter Gleason said of the case: 'I am shocked and outraged how the system has twisted and maligned Miss Neathway, when the biggest issue here is an adulterous act at the hands of a very powerful sports executive.'","Yankees manager accused of being a 'manchild' and conspiring to have one of his lovers institutionalized .

A 'full of life' 100-year-old great-grandmother died after falling 5ft out of a body sling that her two foreign carers were not trained to use, an inquest heard today. May Ward died of multiple injuries after falling out of a sling her carers - from China and Bulgaria - were using to hoist her out of bed at Meppershall Care Home in Bedfordshire in August 2010. Shasha Wei and Rumyana Ivanova, who have now left the country, had not been trained to use the new type of sling introduced to the home three months before, Hatfield Coroner's Court was told. May Ward, who died of multiple injuries after falling out of a sling her two carers were using to hoist her out of bed at Meppershall Care Home in August 2010 . Location: May Ward died of multiple injuries after falling out of a sling her carers - from China and Bulgaria - were using to hoist her out of bed at Meppershall Care Home in Bedfordshire (pictured) in August 2010 . Ms Ward, who was a former London pub landlady, sustained multiple skull fractures, a broken leg, a black eye, and other cuts and bruises after she fell out of the sling at the care home. The carers then put her back into bed and changed her clothes, which could have made Ms Ward's injuries worse, the inquest heard. After a 40-minute delay between Ms Ward's fall and an ambulance arriving, the former Royal Air Force cook was taken to hospital, but died the following day. Ruth Boulton, the Health and Safety Executive's investigating inspector, said the sling, which Ms Ward would have sat on all day, was different to the slings more commonly used around the home. It should have been safer and if used properly it would be highly unlikely that Ms Ward would have fallen out, the inquest heard. Ms Boulton said without training and instructions, it is likely that carers would revert to techniques used on the more common slings, but that were incorrect for this particular sling. Former landlady: May Ward and her husband initially ran a country club and a pub in west London before taking over the Prince William Henry pub (pictured) in Blackfriars, central London, according to her son . There were also questions about whether Ms Ward, a dementia sufferer, should have been hoisted out of bed as some staff referred to her as being ‘agitated’ at the time - which Ms Boulton said should have stopped her carers trying to lift her out of bed. 'People understand what to do but not why they need to do it and that can be an issue. There can also be issues with English as a second language. Some cultures are more questioning. Other cultures, if they are told to do something they will do it until they are told otherwise' Ruth Boulton, Health and Safety Executive's investigating inspector . She told the court: ‘You have general moving and handling training on one sort of sling and one sort of hoist but not the sling used for May. ‘That type of sling is quite unusual. The majority of slings are quite different to that and are used differently. The majority are not sit-on slings. If you don't have instructions you would revert to the generic use.’ Ms Boulton said some of the care home staff had received training from the sling's manufacturer, but that no formal training was given. She added that information on how to use the sling should have been written on the whiteboard in Ms Ward's room. Communication did not appear to be an issue for the carers, as they did not need interpreters in police interviews, DC Philip Freebrey told the court. Watchdog: The home received a 'poor' rating in a Care Quality Commission (London offices pictured) inspection report around the same time as manager Judith Eglen started working there in December 2009 . But Ms Boulton said in past cases, cultural differences could have been an issue. She told the court: ‘What has been found is that people understand what to do but not why they need to do it and that can be an issue. May Ward's son, John Ward, said she was born . in West Tottenham, north London, and met her husband William Ward while . she was a cook in the RAF. Her . husband died in 1989, after the two had successful careers as . publicans. Ms Ward has four grandchildren and six great grand-children - . three girls and three boys, her son said. She . and her husband initially ran a country club and a pub in west London . before taking over the Prince William Henry pub in Blackfriars, central . London, according to Mr Ward. They . retired in 1980 and moved to Kenton, Middlesex, and Ms Ward was taken . into care in 2004. ‘There can also be issues with English as a second language. Some cultures are more questioning. Other cultures, if they are told to do something they will do it until they are told otherwise.’ The care home manager at the time, Judith Eglen, was sacked in the wake of Ms Ward's death, the inquest heard. She began work at the home in December 2009, around the same time it received a zero-star, or ‘poor’, rating in a Care Quality Commission inspection report, the jury heard. That was uprated by the watchdog to a one-star rating in May 2010, around three months before Ms Ward's death and around the same time the new slings were purchased. Ms Eglen told the court that she and the two carers involved re-enacted the lead-up to Ms Ward's fall for her family and the deputy manager a few days after her death. She said Ms Ward was dropped from about 5ft but the carers were ‘good’ at their jobs. ‘Our conclusion (after re-enacting the fall) was that they did everything correctly but they moved too quickly,’ Ms Eglen told the court. Earlier, coroner Edward Thomas told the jury Ms Ward was a lover of the music of the 1930s and 1940s. He described her as a ‘publican of the old school’, saying she ‘kept a good house’. The inquest was adjourned until tomorrow.","May Ward died after falling out of sling, Hatfield Coroner's Court hears .

The second charge . alleges he indecently assaulted a nine-year-old girl between January 1, . 1983 and December 31, 1983. Finally he faces a charge of indecent assault on a 13-year-old girl, on an occasion between July 1, 1984 and September 27, 1984. None of the alleged victims can be named for legal reasons.

Faraque Ahmed, 47, persuaded two victims to plough their savings into bogus high-profit schemes, including a fake investment account with Goldman Sachs, before gambling away their fortunes. Ahmed was granted bail after he surrendered his passport last year, but applied for a new one and is now thought to have fled to Zambia. The conman had claimed he was as successful as his sister, who was awarded an MBE in 2007 for founding Ruby and Millie, and has appeared on TV shows including This Morning, GMTV, Britain's Next Top Model and 10 Years Younger. He also lied about being friends with a host of celebrities and owning three luxury flats in Marble Arch, central London, Snaresbrook Crown Court heard. Ahmed then convinced Shanaz Parveen that he was a fitness instructor for wealthy clients including Elton John's partner, David Furnish, tricking her out of £148,000 after promising her 33 per cent returns on a 'commodities' investment, leaving her saddled with debt. Lynn Anderson was also persuaded to hand over £75,000 to a non-existent US-based clothing company. A jury of seven men and five women took just 20 minutes to find Ahmed guilty of seven counts of obtaining a money transfer by deception, three counts of procuring the execution of a valuable security by deception, and six counts of obtaining property by deception. He was cleared of a single count of obtaining property by deception, relating to Gurpreet Singh, after allegedly conning him into paying £5,000 towards a 'minerals venture'. Sentencing Judge Joanna Korner QC branded Ahmed a 'danger to women' and said: 'He persuaded two women to invest large sums of money in non-existent shares to benefit himself. 'When listed for trial before Christmas he indicated a plea of guilty - but he he falsely obtained a new passport and fled. 'The evidence in this case is so overwhelming, it is not surprising he indicated a guilty plea. 'This was disgraceful behaviour. He took advantage of two ladies who were naive and persuaded them through his charms and wealth to trust him. 'It was planned and well thought-out. 'Previous convictions show he is a professional trickster who not long before completed a sentence for identical offences. 'It's clear the only sentence is custodial and lengthy'. Wanted: Ahmed has been jailed for six years at Snaresbrook Crown Court (pictured) but has managed to flee to Zambia on a second secret passport . Earlier prosecutor Lee Schama told the court: 'It's really very simple - Faraque Ahmed conned or talked people into giving him money. 'He used other people's bank accounts to store the money. 'Faraque Ahmed is a man who talked a great deal about his sister, Ruby Hammer. 'Faraque Ahmed used to tell people about that, persuading them he was also rich and successful.' Lies: Ruby Hammer's brother used her name and that of other celebrities to manipulate victims and take their cash . Giving evidence, Ms Parveen told how Ahmed 'randomly' approached her shopping at Selfridges in Oxford Street, claiming to be a fitness instructor looking for new clients. 'He kept talking about his famous sister Ruby Hammer and how he was incredibly wealthy. 'He said he had no intention of running away with my money because he had plenty of his own. 'He claimed to know a lot of famous people and he claimed he was going to be training Elton John's partner. 'He always named famous people and said he went to an MTV awards party and mingled with a lot of famous people. 'It all stacked up from what he was showing me.' After informing Ms Parveen about a 'great opportunity' and guaranteeing she would never lose her cash, Ahmed bombarded her with calls to persuade her to liquidise assets, stocks and shares and even sell her house. She was told any profit would be 'reinvested' and that the schemes made 'financial sense', jurors heard. Any request for documents would be fobbed off with excuses, Ms Parveen said. Ahmed handed over £20,000 after she demanded her cash back in 2006, but she has yet to receive any further return. Ms Parveen added: 'He manipulated me into taking out loans which I am still paying off.' Ahmed, of Bayswater, west London, denied seven counts of obtaining a money transfer by deception, three counts of procuring the execution of a valuable security by deception, and seven counts of obtaining property by deception. The scams took place between October 2003 and June 2006.","Faraque Ahmed, 47, used his link to sibling Ruby Hammer - founder of Ruby and Millie - to con victims .

A Life Cut Short: Jeremy Nelson, 12, collapsed during an all-star game in the local Burford, Georgia league in which he played . A hoops prodigy from a tiny Georgia town inexplicably collapsed during an organized basketball game Saturday - and later died at a local hospital. Jeremy Nelson, 12, of Buford lost consciousness about 'eight seconds' after his coach, Bryan Larrieu, subbed him out of a Gwinnett Basketball League all-star game at the Suwanee Sports Academy. The precocious hoopster, who wore a size-14 shoe and already towered over peers at six feet in height, reportedly received the annual physicals required to play organized sports in Buford. 'This time yesterday we were cheering him on,' Herb Nelson, Jeremy's heartbroken dad told CBSAtlanta.com Sunday, adding his son had no known health problems. 'You never - you never expect to leave home and come back without him.' Buford is located in the northern central part of Georgia, and is a tiny town with a little over 12,000 residents, by the count of the last U.S. census. Despite its small size, however, the town has witnessed three people die while playing sports in the last year, alone. A Medical Mystery: Nelson reportedly had the regular physicals necessary to play organized sports in Buford - and had no known health problems . 'When it's your time - your number comes up,' Herb Nelson reportedly added. 'I would have traded places a thousand times with my son. You can't run from your time.' Jeremy Nelson was having a typically good game before his unusual demise, according to media accounts. 'He was having a heck of a game when he pulled up from missing a shot,' Larrieu told The Atlanta Journal-Constitution. 'We pulled him out to get some rest, eight seconds later, he was in and out of consciousness.' The boy's frantic family waited what must have seemed an eternity before paramedics arrived. 'There was probably 15 minutes before the local police force came,' Larrieu told WSBRadio.com. 'Another five to seven minutes or so before the firemen came and another eight minutes before the paramedics came.' Seventh-Grade Savant: Jeremy Nelson was a student at Buford Middle School (pictured), beloved for both his happy demenaor, as well as precocious athletic skills . Athletic Heritage: Jeremy Nelson hailed from an athletic family. His father played football at Grambling and his elder sister recently signed a letter of intent to play basketball at Notre Dame . Herb Nelson, meanwhile, told the station, 'When it's your kid lying there, it's never quick enough.' A nearby doctor in attendance was able to ply a defibrillator, according to reports, but Jeremy Nelson later succumbed to whatever it was that caused his collapse at Gwinnett Medical Center. Jeremy Nelson's family told multiple media outlets it's unclear if the seventh-grader suffered from an undetected heart condition. They are reportedly awaiting the results of an official medical examination. The boy hails from an athletically-inclined family. Father, Herb Nelson, played football at Grambling State University; twin sister, Jessica, also plays for Buford's seventh-grade basketball team, and his elder sister, Kristina, a high school senior, recently signed a letter of intent to play hoops at The University of Notre Dame. “He was a phenomenal kid, with a great sense of humor, a loving kid,” Larrieu told The Journal-Constitution. Meanwhile, Adam Gower, another of Jeremy's Nelson's coaches, told the Gwinnett Daily Post, 'He's a special kid from a special family, with a strong Christian background...All his peers looked up to him in the classroom, in the halls and on the court. A Phenomenal Kid: Nelson already towered over peers at six-feet in height, and reportedly wore a size-14 shoe. His father had high hopes he would develop into a great hoopster . 'When he spoke or had a question about history or a basketball play, he had everyone's attention. Jeremy was a great competitor, even if he was not sure of an answer his hand would go up first. Several times in the classroom, Jeremy would be very smooth by talking basketball to get me off subject. 'On the court,' added Gower, 'it was the same results. He would not allow anyone to out do him. (He) was a dynamic ball player and could play any position with his speed, skill level and height. 'Basketball was everything to Jeremy,' Gower added. 'Jeremy's love for the game of basketball is what gave us a connection and that made it very enjoyable for me to teach and coach him. But the one thing I will miss most about Jeremy Nelson is his delightful smile.' The boy was also beloved by his Buford Middle School classmates. 'Jeremy was a very kind young man and an excellent student athlete,' schools superintendent Dr. Geye S. Hamby wrote in a widely-circulated statement. '(He) had a presence in the hallways and on the court...His very pleasant demeanor will be missed by all. The Buford community has dealt with multiple deaths to beloved figures of late, according to The Gwinnett Daily Post, beginning with Buford grad and Wolves football coach Ryan Daniel, who collapsed during a pickup basketball game in January, 2012, and died. Meanwhile, Buford student Adam Smith died in similar fashion during a September basketball workout.","Jeremy Nelson was reportedly having 'a heck of a game,' when his coach subbed him out .

A drunken bus driver crashed a double-decker into a line of parked cars following a night of heavy drinking. Passengers were astonished when the bus, driven by Steven Derrick, smashed into a Mini Cooper after weaving from side-to-side on a street lined with vehicles. When the 24-year-old from Bristol was arrested after the incident, he was over the drink-drive limit of 80mg, having 95mg of alcohol in 100ml of blood. Smashed: The front of the First double-decker after it was crashed by Steven Derrick who was later arrested and found to be over the drink-drive limit . The father-of-one, who worked as a driver since 2008, picked up the First bus from a depot at 6:20am after drinking 'four or five double Jack Daniel's' and a 'pint of lager' the previous night, Bristol Magistrates' court heard. The number 90 bus contained eight passengers before the collision on September 30 last year. One passenger David Summerhayes said that the driver appeared to be 'staring into space' when he boarded the bus and 'blanked' him. Mr Summerhayes said the bus clipped the kerb three times, leading him to assume the driver was a trainee. Derrick later stopped at a bus stop where nobody was waiting, remaining idle for 30 seconds, before doing the same thing further along the route. Passengers were so concerned by his driving that they threatened to leave the bus before their stops. Wreck: The bus crashed into a parked Mini Cooper, which was forced 20ft along the road before hitting another vehicle, which then crashed into a third car . While driving along St John's Lane, having . already narrowly missed a parked car, Derrick swerved into the . middle of the road to avoid parked cars. He then swerved left, hitting the white Mini head-on, forcing it 20ft along the road and into . another parked car, which then hit a third vehicle. Nobody was injured during the incident. Mini owner Sarah Chuk said: 'If I had been in my car pulling away, I dread to think what might have happened.' Derrick resigned after the incident but went on to get another driving job. Passing sentence, magistrate . Roger Dunster said: 'There could have been pedestrians in the vicinity . and the result could have been much more serious.' He was disqualified from driving for a year, ordered to do 80 hours of unpaid work and to pay costs of £85. Reckless: Bristol Magistrates' court heard how Derrick had consumed 'four or five double Jack Daniel's' and a pint of lager the night before he picked up the bus from the depot at 6:20am . Lucky escape: The Mini Cooper's owner Sarah Chuk said: 'If I had been in my car pulling away, I dread to think what might have happened' Judy Hampton, mitigating, said her client had personal problems at the time. She said: 'Derrick is extremely remorseful and apologetic to the passengers on the bus that particular morning. 'He is, himself, shocked by what took place. As this was an early start, clearly the alcohol had not all gone from his system.' First Bus spokeswoman Karen Baxter said the company has a 'stringent' drug and alcohol policy. She said: 'We randomly test 10 per cent of our entire workforce on an unannounced basis for any breaches of this policy and in addition to this have a process whereby when there is reasonable suspicion that an employee is under the influence of drugs or alcohol, they can also be tested.'","Steven Derrick, 24, consumed 'four of five double Jack Daniel's' and pint .

Covered: Breast pumps and kits are now covered under insurance policies under the Affordable Care Act . The Affordable Care Act means many things for women, including birth control for all policy holders with no additional payment from the patient required. A lesser-known facet of the new so-called Obamacare law is a provision that requires insurance companies to cover the full cost of breast pumps without a deductible or out-of-pocket expense for new mothers. The cost of these devices is covered in insurance premiums, which in turn are paid by policyholders. The Washington Post notes that it was pumps, not pills, that caught suppliers off-guard after January 1, when this part of the Affordable Care Act went into law. The catch for all new mothers is that only certain breast pump models are covered, and they have to be ordered through a licensed provider. Yummy Mummy, a New York-based boutique that specializes in accessories a new mother would need, has been mulling how best to serve their clientele. Owner Amanda Cole told the Post that she and her staff have been inundated with calls, and that she’s improvising how best to handle the new business. Available: New York boutique retailer Yummy Mummy is one company registered to supply insurance-approved pumps . The business owner recently signed a contract with health giant Aetna to become a licenced provider of breast pumps. So far, around five kits are covered by insurance, as well as bottles, breast shields, and caps. ‘Now that the plan really took effect on January 1st, there’s been a marked change,’ she told the paper. Without insurance, new mothers could pay upwards of $300 for a pump, milk containers, sterilizers, and other paraphernalia. Control: As part of the ACA in effect, insurance companies must provide any FDA-approved contraception . The $2.8 trillion U.S. healthcare system costs nearly $9,000 a year for every man, woman and child, according to Reuters. As the New York Times noted today, some policyholder’s insurance premiums went up by double-digit percentages in 2013 due in part to the ACA. The Times reported that Anthem Blue Cross in California has proposed raising its rates by 26 percent, and other private insurers are onboard. -Source: U.S. Department of Health and Human Services .","As part of the Affordable Care Act, breast pumps and other supplies must be covered by insurance companies .

Graham Norton’s busy TV and radio schedule – and perhaps a busy party season over Christmas – looked as if it was taking its toll as he left BBC studios in London earlier this week. As well as sporting ruffled hair and grey stubble, the usually chirpy Irishman’s eye bags – which he has previously said are ‘hideous’ – were more pronounced than usual. Rough night? The usually perky presenter looked rumpled as he left BBC studios in London . The 49-year-old Bafta-winning star, who hosts the Graham Norton Show on BBC1 and a Saturday slot on Radio 2, admitted he considered cosmetic surgery on his eyes but was too nervous. He said: ‘I must admit I’ve considered it. I went to see a man about my eye bags, which even I think are hideous. ‘But . every time I had an appointment something would come up. In the end I . took it as a sign that maybe it’s not meant to happen.

I prefer looking . haggard.’ Perky: The TV and radio star has confessed to considering cosmetic surgery in the past . Mr Norton had just finished recording his weekly Radio 2 chat show, which airs from 10am until 1pm, when he was pictured. He has hosted the programme - a mix of celebrity interviews and music  - since Jonathan Ross left the BBC in 2010. In August, the Irish presenter sold his production company So TV to ITV for £10million, with an extra £7million promised if its revenues hit a series of targets by 2016. He is one of the BBC’s most highly paid stars, and is thought to earn at least £1.5million a year under his current contract with the corporation. Mr Norton lives in London’s Docklands with his boyfriend Trevor Patterson and owns homes in  New York, Sussex and Ireland. The presenter has admitted suffering a ‘crisis’ on turning 40, but said he was relaxed about the prospect of turning 50 in April. He said: ‘I genuinely feel OK about turning 50. Forty freaked me out. I didn’t see it coming. My life was in a state of chaos – I was moving jobs and moving house – and it just hit me like a ton of bricks. ‘Whereas right now I feel very settled.

Sales figures reveal how demand has again fallen over . the past year as shoppers turn to honey, jam or peanut butter for their . morning toast. Overall, the jams and spreads groceries category enjoyed 3.3 per cent growth over the past year. Marmalade, the favourite sticky treat of Paddington Bear, has been falling in popularity with sales down in 2012, according to market analysts Kantar Worldpanel . Trade magazine The Grocer said: 'In the battle of the bears, Winnie the Pooh has soundly beaten his rival Paddington over the past 12 months.' The report says Paddington's favourite marmalade is finding itself in a sticky situation with suppliers looking to other spreads to drive growth in the category. It states the reason for marmalade's decline is because of shoppers switching to jam and honey as well as more contemporary offerings, such as chocolate hazelnut spread and peanut butter, which together helped the jams and spreads category grow by 3.3 per cent in 2012. It follows figures from last May, which showed a 6 per cent fall. By contrast, sales of honey rose by 4.1 per cent in value and 3.5 per cent in volume. The magazine said marmalade certainly has not been helped by its reputation as the grandmother's spread of choice. One supplier told The Grover: 'Marmalade has an image of being old-fashioned and tired. 'It is one of those things that people can grow into as they get older but if consumers are not identifying with certain brands then that is a real problem.'

Traffic on married dating websites shoots up by 25 per cent on 7 January, new research has revealed. Exciting: The thrill of an illicit affair can prove to be too much of a temptation for some, especially after a stressful Christmas, with sites such as illicitencounters.com reporting a 25 per cent surge in new members . What's more, Christmas tension isn't the . only factor leading people astray, with the survey also pinpointing Seasonal Affective Disorder (S.A.D) - a . psychological condition that can lead to depression - as one of the root causes of adultery. With more than one in five Brits believed to suffer from the condition, effects can include withdrawing from husbands and wives, as well as feeling dissatisfied with life.

'The effect of the December break shouldn’t be underestimated either. 'When there are already difficulties within a household, Christmas can become an exhausting, miserable slog, which ratchets the pressure up to unbearable levels.

Intuition: You instinctively know they are behaving differently and something is not right with the relationship.2. Dressing differently: The cheating partner takes much more care over their appearance - dressing more provocatively and, if female, pays far more attention to make-up and hair.3. Changing sexual behaviour: This can go one of two ways: they go off sex completely with their regular partner or, occasionally, they want MORE sex at home because the affair makes the cheat more sexually active.4. Becoming hard to reach: You can't get in touch with the cheat on the phone and they change their passwords to their social media sites and mobile phone.5.

Russia and other major powers agreed to back plans by UN envoy Kofi Annan to end the bloodshed in Syria by forming a national unity government. The interim cabinet that could include government and opposition members but would exclude those whose participation would undermine it, according to diplomats. Annan's proposal for a political transition aimed at ending the 16-month conflict in Syria is one of the main topics that Russia, the other four permanent Security Council members and key players in the Middle East will discuss at a meeting in Geneva on Saturday, sources close to discussions said. One diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity, summarized Annan's proposal, saying the Syria conflict can only end when all sides see a peaceful way to a shared future. The potential breakthrough came as Turkey moved military hardware to the border after one of its plains was shot down. Scroll down for video . Peace plan: Measures put forward by UN envoy Kofi Annan, left, to end the bloodshed in Syria under president Bashar Assad have received backing from Russia and other major powers . Annan made clear it was 'vital that any settlement be irreversible, with clear transition steps in fixed timeline,' he said. 'These include establishing a transitional national unity government to create a neutral backdrop for transition,' the diplomat said in his summary of Annan's plan. 'It could comprise present government members, opposition and others, but would need to exclude those whose continued participation or presence would jeopardize the transition's credibility, or harm prospects for reconciliation and stability.' The diplomat added that the idea of excluding certain people was clearly referring to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, though Annan's proposal does not explicitly say Assad could not serve in a national unity government. That gives Russia the option of insisting that Assad be allowed to stay in power. 'The Russians signalled to Annan that they accept his transition plan,' he said. Several Western diplomats confirmed his remarks, adding that all five permanent veto-wielding U.N. Security Council members backed it.

Damage: A man clears through the wreckage of the building as world powers continue to negotiate an end to the violence that has ravaged the country . Another diplomat said Russia's acceptance of Annan's proposal, which he circulated to the five permanent Security Council members this week, did not mean it has abandoned Assad. 'I'm very sceptical,' he said. 'I don't see the Russians giving up on Assad.' The Russian mission at the United Nations was not available for comment. Annan made acceptance of his guidelines for a political transition for Syria a condition for organising Saturday's meeting, which will include the U.S., Britain, France, Russia, China, Turkey, Iraq, Kuwait and Qatar. It will not include Iran or Saudi Arabia. Russia has repeatedly said its supports Annan's idea of creating a 'contact group' of powerful nations and regional players with influence on the Syrian government or the opposition to push for an end to the violence in Syria. Several diplomats said Russia's acceptance of Annan's proposal appeared to signal a shift in its stance on Syria. But it was not immediately clear if Moscow's support for the idea of a national unity government in principle meant that it was now abandoning Assad, a staunch ally and key Russian arms purchaser. The U.S., Britain and France have said that Assad is responsible for the violence, which the United Nations estimates has killed at least 10,000 people, is no longer fit to govern. Russia and China, however, reject what they describe as Western calls for 'regime change.'

Rebel fighters run for cover during the clashes which have continued this week. A transition government appeared to be a step closer to ending the chaos as Russia backed UN plans . Russia has repeatedly said it is not insisting that Assad must remain in power at all costs, but that any decision on whether or not he should step down should come from the Syrian people, not from outside pressure or military intervention, as happened last year in Libya. U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton will attend a meeting this weekend to discuss the situation in Syria . Saturday's meeting, which Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov and U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton will attend, will have to agree on the details of the political transition and the mechanisms for implementing it, diplomats said. Annan, a former U.N. secretary-general, also wants Saturday's meeting to revive his moribund six-point peace plan that has failed to end the fighting between Assad's forces and an increasingly militarized opposition. The conflict has escalated in recent weeks. Annan said the aim of the one-day talks was to identify measures to secure full implementation of his stalled peace plan and Security Council resolutions, including an immediate halt to all violence. The support for Annan's plans came after a convoy of around 30 military vehicles, including trucks loaded with missile batteries, arrived in Turkey's coastal town of Iskenderun and deployed near the Syrian border 50 km (30 miles) away, Turkish agencies said. Turkish Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan, who has given shelter in the border area to rebels fighting Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, announced after Syrian air defences shot down a Turkish warplane last Friday he would step up security there. Turkish television film showed the column moving off on Wednesday, escorted by police cars, along a narrow highway leading out of the main port of Turkey's Hatay province. It included rocket launchers on transporters, anti-aircraft artillery and military ambulances. Erdogan said any military element moving towards the Turkish border and deemed threatening would be declared a military target. The preponderance of air defence weapons in the convoy suggested Turkey was preparing for any possible approach by Syrian helicopters or warplanes. State-run Anatolia news agency said armoured military vehicles were being transported to military installations in Sanliurfa, in the middle of Turkey's border with Syria and Hatay, a panhandle province that juts down into Syria. It said several military vehicles had travelled separately to a military garrison in the border town of Reyhanli in Hatay. There have been no details given of new rules of engagement issued to troops after the shooting down of the warplane which Turkey says was in international air space. The Hatay region is sheltering over 33,000 refugees as well as elements of the rebel Free Syrian Army.","Thirty Turkish military vehicles deploy 50km from Syrian border .

Speaking live on CNN Saturday evening, Mr Parker, 30, was barely maintaining his composure as he spoke of his slain daughter, saying that he was ‘so blessed’ to be her dad. The 30-year-old physician’s assistant said he wanted to get his message out to the greatest amount of people possible, saying that the medium of television was probably the best way to alert friends and family as to how he and his wife are coping. ‘I’ve been contacted by so many people wanting to know how we’re doing that this might be the best way to share those feelings,’ he said, saying that he extended his condolences to all of the other parents and family members who lost a child in the ‘horrible tragedy.’ In a remarkable turn of grace, Mr Parker also said that he offered condolences to the family of the shooter, Adam Lanza. ‘I want you to know that our love and support go out to you as well,’ he said. Big sister: Emilie, far right, was the oldest of the Parker girls; he described her as having an exceptionally kind spirit . Forgiveness: Robbie Parker said that he's praying for the shooter's family and said that he's not mad . The father then began to tearfully speak of his blonde-haired, blue-eyed daughter. 'Emilie's laughter was infectious, and everyone who met her would agree that the world was a better place because she was in it.' ‘My daughter Emilie would be one of the first ones giving her love and support to all of the victims, because that’s the kind of person she is,’ he said, pausing a moment to take a steadying breath. ‘As the deep pain begins to settle in our hearts, we find comfort in the incredible person Emilie was and how many people she was able to touch in her short time on Earth.’ Mr Parker spoke of Emilie’s incredible artistic talent, and how she could often be found carrying crayons, markers, and paper to make colorful cards for those having a dark day.

To close his moving eulogy, Mr Parker said that if there is anything to be learned from the massacre, it was that people should be ‘more compassionate and more humble people.’ Twenty children and six adults were killed when Adam Lanza opened fire on the once-peaceful town of Newtown, Connecticut, sending ripples of shock to through the nation. The grade school shooting was one of the worst in history, second only to the 2007 massacre at Virginia Tech, where 32 people were shot dead.","Robbie Parker lost his daughter Emilie in yesterday's grade school massacre the claimed the lives of 19 other children .

A Chinese property tycoon is working as a street cleaner – because she wants to teach her children the virtue of hard work. Millionaire Yu Youzhen, 53, owns 17 flats and has become wealthy on the back of the Chinese property boom. But instead of pampering herself with her wealth and enjoying lazy days at the salon, spa or shopping, she instead insists on getting up at dawn six days a week to sweep, scrub and empty bins along a two mile stretch of busy road in the central Chinese city of Wuhan. Street cleaner: Millionaire Yu Youzhen, 53, owns 17 flats and has become wealthy on the back of the Chinese property boom, but works as a cleaner . 'I want to be a role model for my son and daughter. I don’t want to sit around idly and eat away my fortune,' said Yu. She said she didn’t want to give her children the impression that being a rich landlady and living off proceeds from her enviable portfolio was an easy way of life. 'That lifestyle would only harm them in the long run,' Yu added. Her sweeping plan seems to have paid off. Both of her children are wage-earners with her son earning a salary of £200 per month as a driver and her daughter earning £300 a month in an unspecified job, according to Chinese newspaper reports. Yu earns a measly monthly salary of £130 from her less than glamorous employer - the Wuchang District Urban Management Bureau. Rags to riches: The former vegetable farmer used to toil on the fields and hauled heavy loads of produce on her back to the daily market . 'I am not a cultured person but I always feel I need to be doing something,' Yu said, who took the job a decade ago after finding her wealthy lifestyle boring. The rags to riches former vegetable farmer used to toil on the fields and hauled heavy loads of produce on her back to the daily market. But when Communist China stated to reform its economy in the 1980s and allowed peasants to start businesses, Yu and her husband saved enough money to construct three five-story village houses,  which they leased out for rent. They have been successfully playing China’s booming property game ever since and expanded their property empire to 21 properties. They have sold four flats, the proceeds from which  - plus the monthly, multiple rental income  - now provide for a luxury lifestyle should the novelty of handling a broom and an honest day’s work ever wear off.","Millionaire Yu Youzhen, 53, owns 17 flats become wealthy on the back of the Chinese property boom .

Key proposals in the Leveson Report could harm investigative journalism, the Information Commissioner warned yesterday . Key proposals in the Leveson Report could harm investigative journalism, the Information Commissioner warned yesterday. Currently reporters are given a wide exemption from data protection rules, allowing them to secretly collect information about corrupt officials, politicians or criminals in preparation for a story. But Lord Justice Leveson proposed a sharp narrowing of the rules so that personal data can be held only if it is absolutely necessary for a specific article that is set for publication. Christopher Graham, who as information commissioner is the national data protection and freedom of information watchdog, yesterday formally responded to the press standards inquiry and endorsed concerns that the changes could undermine investigative journalism. And he said that, if implemented in full, the Leveson  proposals on data protection would move his office ‘closer to being a mainstream statutory regulator of the press’. He added: ‘The significance of the proposed changes should not be underestimated. ‘We acknowledge the importance of ensuring that data protection legislation does not undermine the work of the press and the implications it can have for freedom of expression. ‘The area of subject access is particularly problematic in that there are legitimate concerns about the “chilling effect” Lord Justice Leveson’s proposal might have on investigative journalism.’ The Leveson proposals could force journalists to hand over any personal data they held on someone they were investigating, unless it was absolutely necessary for a specific article which was set for publication. Results of a survey by the Press Complaints Commission last night found nearly 80 per cent of those asked said their complaint had been handled either very well, well or satisfactorily by the body.

Radical proposals at the heart of a new Coalition deal to be unveiled today will see generous tax breaks being offered to families with children under five who need to pay for nurseries and childminders. Britain has some of the highest childcare costs in the world, meaning the typical mother with one child and a full-time job needs to work for up to four months of the year just to break even. Millions with two or more children conclude it is not worth working at all. Childcare costs: A mother-of-one with a full-time job needs to work for four months of the year to break even . David Cameron and Nick Clegg will mark the halfway point in their Government by making reform of childcare a key priority for the next two and a half years. Ministers are to meet later this week to finalise a deal expected to be worth up to £2,000 per year per child for all working parents. The Prime Minister and his Lib Dem deputy will insist the coalition is 'steadfast and united' – and risk alarming party grassroots by hinting at a fresh deal between the Tories and Lib Dems after the next election by claiming their sense of 'shared purpose' has 'if anything grown over time'. As well as childcare, the Coalition's 'mid-term review' will commit to: . A cap of around £75,000 on elderly care costs; . A more generous flat-rate state pension, to be worth around £155 a week after 2015; . Planning reforms to encourage housebuilding and more state mortgage guarantees to help first-time buyers; . A new 'freedom bill' to limit the reach of the state, including reining in criminal record checks for volunteers; . Allowing private companies to build and run new toll motorways and trunk roads. Mr Cameron and Mr Clegg, making a rare joint appearance in Downing Street, will list deficit reduction, welfare reform, tougher school standards, council tax freezes, protecting the NHS, help with energy bills, fuel duty cuts and increases in the personal income tax allowance as among the Government's achievements. 'United': The Prime Minister and Deputy Prime Minister will mark the halfway point in their Government . In a nod to Labour's lead in the opinion polls, they will claim they have 'consistently chosen to do what is right over what is easy or popular; what is in our country's long-term interest over our parties' short-term interest'. Aides said many of the measures will be legislated on in this Parliament, but will only be implemented after 2015. Mr Cameron suggested yesterday he wants to serve as Prime Minister until at least 2020 to see them through. 'We will support working families with their childcare costs. We will build more houses and make the dream of home ownership a reality for more people,' Mr Cameron and Mr Clegg write in a foreword to the new Coalition deal. One suggestion in Whitehall is for a third of the cost of childcare to be made tax deductible. But senior sources suggested a simpler, flat-rate voucher system was more likely to be announced when final details are made public next week. This is seen as a fairer option, since it would be worth the same for every family regardless of income. Changes: The Coalition will commit to capping elderly care costs and a more generous flat-rate pension . One source said the scheme would be implemented before the next election, since it is seen as a key vote winner. The favoured model would more than make up for the loss of child benefit for better-off families that comes into effect today – but only for those where both parents work. It is not clear how the cost of the scheme will be met, though scrapping existing workplace childcare vouchers that give some parents a monthly sum tax-free will go some of the way. Red tape deemed unnecessary – such as adult to child ratios required by organisations offering childcare – will be scrapped. Banks were last night given four more years and greater flexibility to build up cash reserves to prevent a repeat of the 2008 financial crisis. Global regulators watered down a draft plan and gave banks until 2019 to comply with rules making them hold enough liquid assets to avoid taxpayers having to bail them out. They also said a broader range of assets would be considered eligible – including high quality mortgage-backed bonds – under the new system.","Proposal is at the heart of a new Coalition deal due to be unveiled today .

The wife of a prominent doctor has been . found dead and her husband unconscious in their New Hampshire home - six . weeks after the pair were both brutally beaten in a savage home . invasion at their $1.4 million residence. Sonia Quesada was declared dead on arrival in a suspected suicide by paramedics at her mother-in-law's Bedford condominium and Dr. Eduardo Quesada was taken to Catholic Medical Center in Manchester for treatment. Police Chief John Bryfonski said that police were able to communicate with Dr. Quesada, but would not elaborate on what was said except that a 'large amount of prescription medication' was recovered from the scene and neither husband or wife showed any signs of trauma. The couple's 2-year-old daughter was not at the home during the incident and police said that she was in the custody of a family member. Emergency services were called by relatives to the home at around 10am on Monday after family members could not reach the Quesadas by telephone, after they failed to show up for a planned meeting earlier in the day. Chief Bryfonski said that there were no signs of forced entry and that police had to break down the door to gain entry to the home of Norma Quesada, 81, the mother of the doctor. In addition, no forced entry was evident prior to officers . entering the home and no one else was found inside the residence. In November, Quesada and his wife were both hospitalized with serious injuries after an attack at their Bedford home. The couple provided police with a description of a six-foot-tall man wearing a black ski mask and dark clothing who broke in and beat them both unconscious. Scroll Down for Video .

Dr. Quesada's wife Sonia was discovered dead inside this Bedford, New Hampshire home - the doctor was also found inside unconscious . Investigators arrive at the Bedford home to begin examining why the successful anesthesiologist's wife died . At the time police said that the attack may have been random and following this incident, authorities said that they were treating it as a separate matter. Julie Taylor, president of The Mews at Bedford, the 55-plus community where Dr. and Mrs. Quesada were living, said she had made no connection between Norma Quesada and Eduardo Quesada. 'I think that's one of the reasons why the whole incident on Proclamation Court was upsetting ... (was) the fact that there weren't answers for it,' Taylor said. 'Everybody wants to know we're safe because this was an isolated incident, and maybe it was, but the police couldn't confirm any of that for whatever reason. 'Everyone that knows about it now doesn't seem particularly frightened because they believe it is an isolated incident that finished playing out,' she said. The couples $1.4 million home is in Manchester, New Hampshire and was invaded by an intruder on Saturday evening . In November, Dr. Eduardo Quesada, 52, and his wife Sonia were attacked in their Bedford home on Saturday after an apparent break-in at their 2.7 acre $1.4million property. Though they initially reported it as a home invasion-burglary, all theories were being investigated in the wake of revelations that the doctor was arrested last year for a domestic assault. Dr Quesada faced simple assault and obstructing the report of a crime or injury from the November 2011 domestic disturbance call but they were dropped. 'We're not making any connections at this point,' said police chief John Bryfonski after the November 24th home attack. 'The homeowners were obviously confronted by a person or persons of interest. 'We're looking for and expanding the search for evidence at the scene to help investigators unravel what may have happened there.' Police investigating the home invasion have turned to the Drug Enforcement Administration to help with their inquiries . After the November incident police were called by Sonia Quesada. The doctor's . wife was able to rush to her neighbour's home covered in blood after escaping her assailant and knock . on their door to raise the alarm. At the time, police said that Mrs. Quesada had been attacked but was only able to provide a vague description of her assailant. 'Very, very general and nonspecific and not something that would be useful or helpful to release at this point,' Bryfonski said. Arriving at the home, police . discovered the couple's two-year-old child and Dr. Quesada lying on the . floor so injured that police initially thought he was dead. Bedford Police have insisted that they do have a person of interest but are not going to ask the public for their help with their investigation .

Staying youthful is more important to women than men, with 40 per cent saying it is 'very important'. Two-thirds of those surveyed found remaining active is the best way to stay youthful . Men do not believe old age starts until they are 81 - while for women it is a mere 70 years old. Other factors to staying young include laughing, smiling and staying curious. Psychologist Dr Tomas Chamorro-Premuzic told the Daily Express: 'Getting in touch with our inner youth is beneficial for our mindset. 'But it also creates physical reactions such as releasing endorphins and dopamine that create a sense of happiness and well-being.' Researchers were also told that working late, commuting and not having time for hobbies or socialising contributed to looking older. Laura Pope, from Evian, which sponsored the study, said: 'Age is a state of mind and an attitude to life.'

Abducted: Moira Anderson went missing in 1957 and is thought to have been murdered by rapist Alexander Gartshore . Police searching for the body of an 11-year-old girl who vanished while running an errand in 1957 began exhuming a grave yesterday. Moira Anderson is believed to have been abducted and murdered after catching a bus, but no trace of her has ever been found. Yesterday, almost 56 years after  the Scottish schoolgirl was last  seen, forensic experts began excavating a grave to see if her remains were hidden there. Convicted paedophile Alexander Gartshore, who was a bus driver in Coatbridge, Lanarkshire, when Moira went missing, was later accused of the murder by his own daughter. Gartshore, who died in 2006, is suspected of burying Moira’s body in a plot intended for a recently deceased acquaintance, Sinclair Upton. It later emerged he told a colleague that Mr Upton had done him a ‘big favour’. The exhumation was ordered after Moira’s sister, Janet Hart, who lives in Australia, launched a petition for Mr Upton’s grave to be opened in the hope of finding her remains. Forensic experts have warned they faced a sensitive and painstaking task, however, with a total of eight people known to have been buried in the plot dating back to 1908. A radar survey already carried out suggests there may be an extra body there. Scroll down for video . On the scene: Sandra Brown, daughter of suspect Alexander Gartshore, at the cemetery where she believes he buried Moira's body . Investigation: Police have begun exhuming a grave at Old Monkland Cemetery in Coatbridge, Scotland, in the search for a schoolgirl who went missing almost 56 years ago . Hope: The exhumation, which began at the request of Moira's sisters Janet Hart and Marjory Muir, is expected to last several days . Mystery: Police are hoping to find the remains of Moira Anderson who disappeared while running an errand for her grandmother in 1957 . Moira was last seen catching a bus on . her way to the local Co-op on an errand for her grandmother in February . 1957. Gartshore – a convicted child rapist – has been blamed for . Moira’s murder by his daughter,  Sandra Brown, in her book Where There . Is Evil. Shortly before his death in 2006, he told her Moira had haunted . him all his life. Mrs Brown, 63, set up the Moira . Anderson Foundation which campaigned for the murder case to be reopened, . a plea granted last year by the Lord Advocate Frank Mulholland. At the . time, Mrs Brown said: ‘I truly believe this grave has secrets to give . up. We owe it to Moira to open it.’ Police have warned that the heavily . waterlogged grave at Old Monkland Cemetery in Coatbridge has as many as . three layers, and that establishing whether it contains Moira’s remains . is likely to be a slow process. Suspect: Convicted rapist Alexander Gartshore, left, died in 2006. His daughter Sandra Brown, pictured with her father right, believed he was Moira's killer for decades . Sensitive: Chief Inspector Kenny McLeod said officers would be as respectful as possible to the graves . Excavation: Officers begin exhuming the grave which is believed to belong to an acquittance of suspect Alexander Gartshore . They are exploring the possibility . that Moira’s body may have been dumped under a coffin in the grave, . which was thought to have been open around the time of her . disappearance. Yesterday a large section of the . cemetery was cordoned off with police tape, with a large black tent and a . series of smaller blue tents erected around the excavation site. The exhumation is being led by Professor Sue Black and a team from the forensic anthropology department at Dundee University. Chief Inspector Kenny McLeod, of .

Their action was in support of an incident at a Hollister shop in Houston, Texas, where a mother claims she was thrown out for breast-feeding her son. Ms Hitchens, Ms Murray and Ms Hitches say they found themselves subjected to the very same treatment they were protesting against. 'We walked through the store and the employees asked if we needed help with anything,' said Diana Hitchens of Elkton, Maryland told NBC 10.

The security guards did disappear, Ms Murrey said but only to come back in the company of a Delaware State Trooper who was on patrol in the mall.

Police investigating the murder of a church organist who died after he was attacked on Christmas Eve have arrested a man. Lay preacher Alan Greaves was making his way to midnight mass at St Saviour's Church, near his home in High Green, Sheffield, when he was subjected to the attack. A 21-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of Mr Greaves's murder, South Yorkshire Police said. Mr Greaves, who died after he was . attacked on the way to play at Midnight Mass, was attacked with a  weapon . and discovered by a pizza-delivery boy. He was taken to hospital where he underwent four hours of emergency surgery for multiple head injuries. He died two days later. Police said the arrest came after an excellent public response to an appeal made by detectives yesterday. At a press conference, Detective Superintendent Matt Fenwick said police had not established a motive for Mr Greaves's murder. Police also released CCTV footage of two men filmed just before the 68-year-old grandfather was attacked as he went to the church a few hundred yards away from his home on December 24. Mr Greaves died from severe head injuries three days later. More than 50 police officers have been working on the case. A South Yorkshire Police spokesman said tonight: 'Following yesterday's media appeal by Senior Investigating Officer Detective Superintendent Matt Fenwick, and an excellent public response, a 21-year-old man from the High Green area of Sheffield has been arrested on suspicion of the murder of Alan Greaves. 'Inquiries are continuing and the investigation team wish to reiterate their appeal to the community of Sheffield to continue to come forward with information. 'Anyone with information should contact the incident room on 01709 443723.' Two men were arrested last month in connection with Mr Greaves's murder and bailed pending further inquiries. Last week, independent charity Crimestoppers put up a £10,000 reward to help find those responsible for Mr Greaves's death. The reward will be available to anyone providing information to Crimestoppers leading to the arrest and conviction of any person or persons responsible for Mr Greaves's death.

A father who set up a cocaine ring to help funnel money to his fugitive son has been jailed for 11 years. Robert Blackburn, 64, turned to drug dealing after his son Steven became a wanted man when he fled to Northern Cyprus while on licence for shooting a doorman. When Blackburn Sr was caught in a safe house with £45,000 in cash and a kilo of cocaine on him, he paraphrased the famous Laurel and Hardy line: 'That's another fine mess I've gotten myself into'. Mess: Robert Blackburn (left) was jailed for 11 years after he set up a drugs ring to funnel cash to his fugitive son Steven Blackburn who was on the run in Northern Cyprus . Blackburn Sr had been freed from a 10-year jail term for heroin supply in 2008, but returned to crime to help his son in the Mediterranean. Steven shot doorman John Ormston, 26, twice at point blank range outside his home in Throckley, Newcastle, with a double-barrelled shotgun. Four men, including Steven, were jailed indefinitely for the 2005 attack. Newcastle Crown Court heard how Steven had recruited the gang to go after Mr Ormston as he was furious when he discovered his former friend had started seeing his mother, Valerie Fothergill, in 2002. Steven, who was 25 at the time, mistakenly believed that Mr Ormston had acted as a police informer and was responsible for passing on information that led to Blackburn Sr being jailed for the drug-dealing offence. A judge at Newcastle Crown Court ordered that Steven serve at least six years for the attack, but after his release he fled the country while still on licence. His father, a joiner with a passion for boats, then began playing a leading role in the cocaine gang. Deals: Blackburn Sr's gang would deal cocaine in a car park behind the Commercial Hotel pub in Winlaton, Gateshead (file picture) He helped orchestrate the collection and supply of kilo shipments of the high-purity drug. Deals were made in a car park behind the Commercial Hotel pub in Winlaton, Gateshead, with Blackburn Sr often arriving in a BMW. Henchmen moved the cocaine as well as carefully packaged bundles of cash - in £20 notes and up to £60,000 a time - from safe houses to underworld contacts. However, Blackburn Sr fell under police suspicion in spring last year, Newcastle Crown Court heard. Quote: When Blackburn Sr was arrested he paraphrased comedy duo Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy . Northumbria Police launched an operation, codenamed Vegas, putting him and his associates under surveillance and Blackburn Sr was later arrested in a safe house, where he made the Laurel and Hardy quip. Jeff Mason, prosecuting, said: 'The day of the police strike was August 8 last year, the day arrests and searches took place. 'When Blackburn was arrested, his response was ""That's another fine mess I've gotten myself into"".' Blackburn Sr, of Throckley, admitted conspiracy to supply cocaine together with more than 10,000 Class C controlled BZP tablets also recovered during the operation. Jailing him for 11 years, Judge David Wood said only a long prison term could be justified. He said: 'You are described as playing a leading role and whatever your personal problems, which led to you being involved, the fact is you led a number of other people into much more serious trouble than they have ever been in before. 'These are serious, professional offences and there are aggravating features in your case.' Six other men arrested during the Vegas investigation were given jail terms totalling 25 years. Christopher Knox, mitigating, said Blackburn had been a leading man in the conspiracy but that another unknown figure had been above him. Mr Knox said: 'He became involved because he was helping his son who is a fugitive in northern Cyprus. 'Telephone evidence shows an abundance of calls to his son and there is material about the funding of his son by a co-accused who was a longstanding friend.' Alan Atkinson, 44, also of Throckley, one of the other six defendants, admitted conspiracy after he tested the purity of the cocaine. He was jailed for six years. David French, 58, of Winlaton was a 'warehouser' who used not only his own home but also his elderly mother's house to store drugs and cash, and was jailed for seven years. Alan Bullock, 49, of Longframlington, Northumberland, acted as a courier, as well as warehouseman. He was also sentenced to six years behind bars. Fugitive: Steven Blackburn fled to northern Cyprus while still on licence after he shot doorman John Ormston . Robert Cann, 35, of Stoke-on-Trent moved the drugs to Tyneside from Liverpool and was jailed for two years. Alan Bell, 33, of South West Denton, Newcastle, laundered at least £145,000 of the gang's drugs cash. He was a close friend of Steven Blackburn, and was sentenced to two years in prison. Bell's younger brother James, 29, of West Denton, also admitted laundering some of the gang's cash and was jailed for two years. Judge Wood told them: 'All of you knew what you were getting into, knew that it involved great risk, but were prepared to put those risks to one side because it also involved profits to all of you. 'The supply was well-organised with drugs being purchased from the North West of this country, being carefully tested, being diluted and being distributed by you throughout, no doubt, the North East of England. 'Large amounts of cash were generated and you all intended to profit. 'These are therefore, serious offences for which only custody can be justified.' Another defendant, Brian Carrier, 37, of Kenton, Newcastle, was jailed for three years and eight months after admitting possessing almost 4kg of amphetamine with intent to supply at an earlier hearing. He had been arrested during a spin-off operation from the Vegas inquiry.","Ex-con Robert Blackburn, 64, set up drugs ring to supply son on the run in Northern Cyprus with money .

He has since apologised for his 'very public meltdown', but says he remains 'gravely troubled' by the influence of Scientology. Scroll down to see the video . Ready for legal fight: Panorama reporter John Sweeney has written a a book which claims the Church of Scientology believes the Holocaust was planned and carried out by psychiatrists . The central tenet of the religion - founded by L Ron Hubbard in 1952 - is that an extraterrestrial being called Xenu brought billions of people . to earth in spaceships. Mr Sweeney has now written a new book called The Church of fear: Inside the Weird World of Scientology which he admits places him at risk of facing libel action. Writing in the Independent, he said: 'I lost my temper with Tommy Davis inside the brainwashing section of the Church's exhibition on psychiatry (called) The Industry of Death. 'Scientologists believe that psychiatry is Nazi pseudoscience. They believe that the Holocaust was planned and carried out by psychiatrists.' Heated: Mr Sweeney's rant (above) at a Scientology spokesman five years ago went viral after he was filmed during a furious outburst at one of the cult's exhibitions . Mr Sweeney said he has teamed up with a . 'bloke with a dog I met in a park' to produce his book because he . claims all the major publishers turned him down, with some citing libel . risk as the reason. He says . his 'dog bloke' is literary agent-turned-publisher Humfrey Hunter, . whose father and grandmother, he claims, were German-Jewish . psychiatrists who wrote a book setting out medical evidence that Mad .

In Beyond Belief: My Secret Life Inside Scientology And My Harrowing Escape, she will reveal 'strange and disturbing' details about growing up in the church and will provide a first-hand account of Scientology's 'upper ranks', its publishers William Morrow say. Mr Sweeney says he is ready to fight a legal battle with the cult, which has been known to take libel action in the past, and claims he is supported by a number of former Scientology members. They include, he claims, Mike Rinder who quit the Church after goading Mr Sweeney, alongside Mr Davis and Marc Headley. 'Getting the book out has not been easy,' Mr Sweeney wrote in the Independent. 'You don't need capital to publish a book on Scientology – you need courage.' Scientology has been dogged by controversy almost since the day it was created. The belief was founded in 1952 by L Ron Hubbard who until then had been known for writing pulp and science fiction novels. Followers . believe that inside them are ancient alien beings known as thetans . which have lived for thousands of years on other planets and were . brought to Earth on a space ship that looks like a Douglas DC-8 plane. Through a process called Dianetics they make themselves far better people, and even massively boost their IQ. Such . claims however have never been proved and instead Scientology has faced . allegations it charges outrageous fees for its services and abuses its . followers. Among the . most controversial aspects are 'audits' in which followers have to . explain their inner secrets to a superior, including their sex lives.

The younger brother of an eight-year-old girl who was allegedly stabbed to death by her mother told children's advocacy workers he witnessed the murder. Semeria Greene is charged with murder in the December 30 slaying of her daughter Tameria. A petition filed on Monday in Wayne County Juvenile Court stated the boy, four, said that his mother 'had a big knife and cut his sister and his mother killed Ti-Ti'. Greene has three other sons who the state are petitioning to take from her permanently. Michigan Child Protective services tried for two years to remove Tameria Greene and her four younger brothers from their mother's care, even petitioning the court as recently as November. Greene was charged last Wednesday with felony murder and first-degree child abuse and her four sons have been turned over to Child Protective Services, police spokeswoman Sgt Eren Stephens said. Neighbors called police to the Greene family's apartment in the Martin Luther King block just east of downtown Detroit in the early hours of Sunday morning. When officers arrived at 2.42am, they found Tameria bleeding and unresponsive on the floor, having been stabbed in the chest, and recovered three bloodied kitchen knives that were scattered around her. The little girl was taken to hospital where she was pronounced dead and Semeria Greene was taken into custody. The hospital told police Tameria also had bruises, possible bite marks and scratches on her face. 'This is only the second day of the year and we are charging a parent with a child homicide,' said Kym Worthy, county prosecutor. 'This case is made even more profoundly sad because today would have been Tameria's ninth birthday.'

My sister did not even like to whoop her kids,' Tanisha Robinson told Fox 2 News. 'Jovan Mull, he should be arrested. He fled the scene of a crime,' she added. According to the Detroit Free Press, Greene told police her daughter had been making sandwiches in the kitchen when she heard a knock at the door. It's . unclear what happened next, but Greene said she then saw Tameria lying . dead on the living room floor. The police report says there was no . evidence the girl was making sandwiches. Greene had blood on her shirt and sock and was giving her daughter CPR when police arrived, according to reports. Police said she was uncooperative after her arrest, refusing to walk and pretending to fall asleep. They said her breath 'smelled of metabolizing alcohol.' According to the Free Press, . officers found a bloody knife by the sink in the house, a folding knife . on top of the refrigerator and a butcher knife between couch cushions. Failings: Michigan Child Protective Services attempted to remove Tameria, pictured, from her mother's care for two years but a court ruled against it . Gone: The little girl, pictured left with her mother Semeria, right, was found in a pool of blood with stab wounds, bruises and bite marks . They also found a dried blood shoe print in the dining room and dried . blood in the living room. Greene . had a bruise under her eye when police arrived at the apartment, which . relatives said may have occurred at the hands of her abusive partner. State child welfare workers have known . of problems with the family for at least two years and have . unsuccessfully tried to take Greene's children into protective custody, . said Michigan Department of Human Services Director Maura Corrigan. Support: The family of Semeria Greene, pictured, don't believe she killed her daughter and claim police should be questioning Greene's allegedly abusive partner, Jovan Mull . Corrigan said an expedited internal . review after the death showed that case workers have been trying to . protect the children and act on concerns raised by family, friends and . neighbors. 'Most recently, DHS petitioned the court on November 28, unsuccessfully, to remove Tameria and her siblings from her mother's home,' Corrigan said in a statement. It's not immediately clear why the court blocked the state's attempts to remove the children from Green's care. Corrigan said the department 'continued to provide court-ordered counseling services to the family as well as conducting in-home visits, the last of which occurred only two days before Tameria's death.' 'We share the grief felt by her loved ones and her community,' the woman said. Tameria's 7, 4, 2 and 1-year-old brothers now are in foster care. A motive for the stabbing was not clear. Neighbor Kimyatta Craigmiles told The Detroit News that she had earlier seen Greene arguing with a man in the complex's parking lot. According to the Detroit Free Press, . police had contact with Greene over allegations of child abuse and . neglect, as well as the previous visits from Children's Protective . Services. Greene . had taken Tameria to Children's Hospital of Michigan in October with . bruises on her body and told hospital officials an incident had occurred . at school, a report said. Neighbors noted how the mother would leave her children alone at times and was abusive. She had reported checked her self into a mental health clinic in the past. Memorial: Family and friends tied balloons on the door step of the Greene's home at the Martin Luther King Apartments, in Detroit, after the stabbing . Emotional: Relatives break down at a candlelight vigil for Tameria Greene, pictured . Court records show that Greene's sister was given guardianship of Tameria and at least one of her brothers in 2007, but they were returned to their mother in January 2008. Minister Craig Fuqua Bey, who will be conducting Tameria's funeral service next week, told the Free Press Greene was a loving mother. 'She loved her children,' he said, 'and her children loved her.' Neighbors adorned the family's porch and front door at the Martin Luther King Apartments with balloons and stuffed animals in the girl's memory. Greene is scheduled to be arraigned this afternoon and faces a maximum penalty of life in prison without parole if convicted of murder. The child abuse charge carries a maximum 15-year prison sentence.

Accused killer Jodi Arias has sobbed in court as prosecutors showed the jury images of horrendous wounds she allegedly inflicted on her former boyfriend as she stabbed him to death in his shower. The 32-year-old kept her head down and refused to look at the grisly images of Travis Alexander, whom she is accused of stabbing 27 times before slitting his throat and shooting him in the head. She wiped away tears as the  Maricopa County . medical examiner said Alexander 'may have' already been dead when she shot him in the head - a key detail that could make way for the death penalty. If . she did shoot Alexander after he was already dead it could qualify as a . 'heinous and depraved' murder, which would more likely send her to death row in Arizona. WARNING: EXTREMELY GRAPHIC CONTENT . Emotion: Jodi Arias breaks down as pictures of her ex-lover's body are shown in her murder trial . 'Killer': She stands accused of stabbing and shooting Travis Alexander to death at his home in 2008 . Yet the medical examiner said he could . not be fully certain Alexander was already dead from blood loss as the . body was already decomposing when it was found five days after the . killing. With the delicate brain tissue also . decomposing, he could not determine a bullet track through the skull or . how much hemorrhaging had occurred, which would signal whether Alexander . was still alive. The evidence was brought after an extended weekend break in Arias' murder trial. Prosecutor Juan Martinez  also displayed images from the scene at Alexander's Mesa, Arizona home in June 2008. Some showed defensive slash wounds on . Alexander's hands, sustained when he tried to fight back, and grazes on . his legs, suggesting his body was later dragged. Grief: Travis Alexander's sisters refuse to look at the images of the body in the trial on Tuesday . 'Obsessed': The couple only dated for five months before breaking up over jealous issues, she said . Prosecutors are expected to argue that Arias slit Alexander's throat in . the hallway and then dragged his body back into the bathroom, ABC News reported. Alexander's sisters, who were seated in . the front row of the Phoenix courtroom, refused to look up at the images . throughout the testimony, keeping their heads bowed. Arias has admitted to killing Alexander, whom she dated for five months in 2007, but claims it was out of self defense as he was controlling and possessive. Yet the prosecution alleges she was a jealous girlfriend who became obsessed with Alexander after they broke up - even slashing his tires and hacking into his Facebook account. Fighting back: Stab wounds on Mr Alexander's hands show that he tried to defend himself as she attacked . Grisly: Images of the crime scene where Travis Alexander was killed have been shown to the jury in the murder trial of his ex-girlfriend. Here a bloody sink near to his body is pictured . Mess: Prosecutors said it appeared as if someone had tried to wipe the blood away after the murder . Blood-soaked: Another image shows blood stains on the carpet near his bathroom in his bedroom . They claim she murdered him after becoming enraged that he wanted to start dating another woman. The . pictures showing Alexander's wounds are just the latest pieces of bizarre evidence in . the trial that . is already being compared to the dramatic 2010 murder trial of Casey . Anthony. Last week Martinez showed pictures of . the bloody crime scene, with congealed blood seen on the toilet, floor, . carpet and across walls. Pictures showed blood-soaked clothes . and towels that had been tossed in Alexander's washing machine, . presumably in a failed attempt to remove the stains. They . were found alongside Alexander's water-logged camera. Investigators . found images on the camera showing the pair having sex on the day of the . murder and photos of Alexander posing nude in the shower moments before . we was murdered. Attack: Images show where Alexander sustained stab wounds, including on the back of his neck . Violent: He also sustained stab wounds to his head and his neck was sliced from ear to ear . Putting up a fight: He also suffered defensive wounds to his hands as he tried to fight back . In a bizarre twist, the camera also contained images of Alexander after the murder and a picture of Arias dragging his body - apparently taken accidentally when the camera was dropped. Another image shows Arias in a . t-shirt reading 'Travis Alexander's', which the defense has used to suggest his possessiveness. Arias, a photographer7, has pleaded not-guilty to first degree murder. Alexander was found dead in his home in suburban Mesa on June 9, 2008 by two friends who went to check on him after he had been out of contact for days. Arias originally claimed she had not . seen Alexander the day of his murder, before claiming she had seen two . men kill him, before eventually saying that she killed him out of self defense. 'Last photo': Among the images on the camera was this one showing Travis in the shower before his death . Possessive: The jury was shown a picture of Arias in a t-shirt Alexander made reading 'Travis Alexander's' Jennifer Willmott, an attorney for . Arias, told jurors her client acted in self-defense after Alexander . 'lunged at Jodi in anger' in his suburban Mesa home after she dropped . his new camera. 'Jodi's . life was in danger. He knocked her to the ground in the bathroom where . there was a struggle,' Willmott said. 'If she did not have to defend . herself, she would not be here.' Yet prosecutors argue Arias was a jealous woman who brutally attacked Alexander after he tried to end their relationship. 'This . is not a case of whodunit,' Deputy Maricopa County Attorney Juan . Martinez said in his opening statement. 'The person who committed this . killing sits in court today - Jodi Ann Arias.' Alexander had told friends Arias had . become too possessive and was acting like a stalker, so he ended their . relationship to see other women. But phone and email records indicate . the pair continued to carry on a sexual relationship. Suspect: Travis Alexander's friend and roommate who found his body in June 2008 told a 911 dispatcher that Jodi Arias had been stalking and threatening the man . Happier times: She met Travis Alexander, a Mormon and motivational speaker, at a Las Vegas conference . The couple had met at a work . conference in Las Vegas in September 2006 and began speaking on the . phone every day. Court records show they exchanged as many as 82,000 . emails.

"By . Daniel Bates . PUBLISHED: . 15:44 EST, 8 January 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 16:18 EST, 8 January 2013 . The relative who called a medical examiner demanding a fresh inquiry into the poisoning of a father who won $1m on the lottery ‘didn’t accept it was going to be a natural death’, MailOnline can reveal. In a dramatic phone call, the family member of Urooj Khan flatly rejected the original ruling and ordered investigators to have another look. Now after further tests revealed Mr Khan, 46, of Chicago's North Side, died due to cyanide poisoning his body is set to be exhumed - so his final meal can be examined. MailOnline can also reveal that according to a respected poison expert, Mr Khan would have ingested the killer dose no more than an hour before he died. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Foul play: A family member called police to say Khan had not suffered a 'natural death' after he had been buried. His body will now be exhumed to inspect the contents of his last meal . Fateful purchase: Khan spent $60 in June on two Illinois state lottery tickets. The second one of which proved to be a winning ticket . Habit: Khan was revealed to have spent up to $600 a day on scratchcards . According to a police report cited by the Chicago Tribune, that fateful day Mr Khan arrived at his Chicago home with his wife Shabana Ansari, and daughter, Jasmeen and ate some dinner. He then went to bed before waking up screaming as his body was ‘suffocated cell by cell’. Mr Khan, a hardworking immigrant who ran a laundry business, won $1m on the Illinois State Lottery last June but just a day after he collected his winnings on July 21 he died. The initial examination by the Cook County Medical examiner found he had died of heart disease, or natural causes. Drugs like cyanide do not show up on standard toxicology reports. However, after the intervention of a relative, a more thorough toxicology report was ordered. The cause of death has now been ruled as poisoning by cyanide and it is being treated as a homicide by Chicago police. Entrepreneur: Khan emigrated to the U.S. during the 1980s, and had saved enough to open three dry cleaning shops (pictured) on Chicago's Far North side . Cook County Medical Examiner Stephen Cina told MailOnline: ‘I believe they called up and said they wanted to us to look into it further. ‘They didn’t accept it was going to be a natural death.’ Mr Cina added that he hopes to exhume Mr Khan’s body within ‘the next few weeks’ from Chicago’s Rosehill Cemetery and that an analysis of the content of his stomach could take place afterwards. Mr Cina said: ‘I have had one cyanide death in 4,500 autopsies so they are unusual, as are exhumations. To have a case where there is both is very unusual’. Mr Khan emigrated to the US during the 1980s from India, and through hard work and discipline, saved up enough cash to open first one and eventually three dry cleaning shops in Chicago. Last June he paid $60 for two lottery scratch-off tickets at a 7-11 convenience store near his home and, upon scratching the second one, reportedly leaped in the air and shouted, 'I hit a million!' Days later, with his wife and daughter at his side at the same store, Mr Khan gleefully accepted an oversized, mock check from lottery officials. At the time, he said he was going to use the money to pay bills, donate to St. Jude's Children's Hospital in Chicago and grow his dry-cleaning business. After taxes, the prize money amounted to $425,000. The day after receiving a check for his winnings, Khan awoke screaming in pain in his bed at his Chicago home (pictured). An expert said this is caused when muscle contract suddenly as the poison kills you 'cell by cell' No signs of foul play: An initial autopsy on Khan performed by the Cook County Medical Examiner's Office found nothing awry . Illinois State Lottery spokesman Mike Lang said that it was eventually cashed August 15 and that if a lottery winner dies, the money typically goes to his or her estate. He had recently returned to Chicago from the hajj pilgrimage to Saudi Arabia inspired to lead a better life and had sworn off buying lottery tickets - except just this once. His Islamic faith dictates that he should not even have been gambling in the first place. Jimmy Goreel, 51, the manager of the 7-11 store where Mr Khan bought the ticket, said that in 2011 Mr Khan became ‘addicted’ to scratchcards and used to come in every day spending up to $600 a time. He said: ‘Mr Khan would buy an entire book of scratchcards and would leave them with me the next morning and ask me to work out how much he had won. ‘That lasted about two months then he realised he had to slow down. ‘He started getting addicted to it and he said he had to stop as he was a working person and a family man. ‘A lot of the times he would come in his wife would come together with him’. Deborah Blum, a poison expert whose book ‘The Poisoner’s Handbook’ is being made into a PBS TV series, said that Mr Khan would have been in ‘absolute agony’ and likely coughed up blood as he was killed. A former chemist, Miss Blum said: ‘A good lethal dose of cyanide will kill you in ten minutes. A mid range dose and people die within the hour. For a poison that’s pretty fast. ‘Cyanide poisoning is a nasty death. There is an enzyme which allows your cells to breathe and the cyanide wipes that enzyme out. ‘It suffocates you cell by cell. Symptoms include seizures, extreme shortness of breath and usually cardiac arrest. ‘There is something known as a ‘cyanide scream’ where your muscles are contracting, so this could be what Mr Khan’s relatives heard’. A good man: The cashier at the 7-11 where Khan bought his fateful lotto tickets said Khan was a 'gentle' man and a 'nice person' who cared for his family . Miss Blum added that cyanide would have had a bitter taste and that the best way to disguise it would be to put it into spicy food. A mere 200mg would be enough to take somebody’s life, and that could be obtained from pesticides or certain kinds of rat poison. Historically, money is a ‘good reason’ why people poison, Miss Blum explained. She said: ‘In the 19th century they used to call cyanide ‘inheritance powder’ because so many people used it to get their inheritance early. ‘People also poison to punish, such as getting revenge on their boss, or to end a relationship that they want out of. ‘Poisoners are unique killers because they are never impulsive. Poisoners are planners. ‘There’s always an element of calculation, and they think they will get away with it - just as nearly happened in this case.’ Repeated calls to Ms Ansari went unanswered. She has told The Chicago Tribune: 'By God's grace, he was a workaholic. 'Day or night ... he picks up the phone 24/7. 'He made the clients happy by doing his job. He could not be everywhere, but he had to be everywhere.' Chicago Police Department spokeswoman Melissa Stratton confirmed the department was now investigating the death. No arrests have so far been made.","Medical Examiner reveals family member called to say death of Urooj Khan, 46, was foul play .

A brave five-year-old girl who was given the all clear for a brain tumour after the NHS 'abandoned' her has died just months after the cancer returned. Ruby Owen was told she had beaten the cancer in 2010 after her family raised £170,000 to fund specialist radiation treatment in America. Her parents, Martin, 42, and Rachel, 40, were left devastated when the NHS refused to fund her treatment after she was diagnosed with paediatric cancer neuroblastoma in 2009. Rachel and Martin Owen pictured with their daughter Ruby. She passed away on Monday at a hospice . Ruby (pictured with her parents) was given all-clear in 2010 after having treatment in the U.S. However, the cancer returned a year later . Martin and Rachel, from Kidsgrove in Staffordshire, were told their daughter needed proton radiotherapy - an advanced treatment that does not damage the tissue surrounding tumours, as would conventional radiotherapy. This means it can be used in extremely delicate areas, such as brains and eyes, to destroy tumours without causing catastrophic harm. The NHS has one low-powered proton radiotherapy machine, but it can treat only eyes, not brains.Her father left his thriving fire-alarm business to raise nearly £170,000 to take Ruby to the US for specialist radiotherapy. Speaking at the time, Martin said: 'The head of oncology told us very candidly: ""You need to ring America.""' He added: 'There is an experimental project to send children abroad for this treatment, but we were then told the (NHS) team would not fund our trip because Ruby's survival chances were too low.' Despite the devastating blow, the family refused to give up and did everything from shaking tins outside football grounds to having sponsored chest waxes to raise the cash for her trip. Rachel Owen and her daughter Ruby who had paediatric cancer neuroblastoma . In 2010 her family raised £170,000 - . including a £20,000 donation from comic Lee Mack who heard about Ruby's . plight - and she travelled to America. She was given the all clear and returned to the UK but last February tests showed she had developed a second tumour. Doctors told Ruby's parents a few weeks ago that there was nothing more they could do for her . Friends, relatives and a local . charity raised £120,000 to send her to America for 10 weeks and 33 . gruelling treatments which this time failed to eradicate the cancer. And in October, her family confirmed Ruby only ""had weeks to live"" after doctors told them there was nothing more they could do. She died on Monday at the Donna Louise Children's Hospice in Trentham with her family by her side. A spokeswoman said: 'Ruby Owen passed away peacefully surrounded by her family. 'Her family continue to receive support from the hospice and we ask that their privacy is respected during this very difficult time.' The charity Caudwell Children who helped raise money for her treatment said Ruby had 'touched many people's hearts.' Spokesman Ben Sutcliffe said: 'As a charity we fund raise all around the country, but never had we seen an outpouring of emotion like we did when we asked the local community for help and donations for Ruby.' A message from the official Ruby Owen Twitter account said: 'Just to let you all know Ruby has slipped away from us this afternoon. She is with the angels now. Heartbroken :( thank u for the support.' Last June heartless conman David Saville, 22, was slapped with a community order after pocketing hundreds of pounds from the charity set up to help her. Saville pretended he was taking part in a sponsored bike ride in aid of the brave youngster and used official fundraising forms to swindle £237 from wellwishers.","Ruby was diagnosed with a brain tumour in 2009 and needed specialist radiation treatment .

Farmers across Europe have ignored an EU ban on 'pig cages’, meaning UK families will continue to eat pork, ham and bacon from cruel factory farms. British farmers stopped using the cages or sow stalls in 1999 because they were so small the huge animals did not even have enough room to turn around. The EU finally agreed to outlaw the system across member states from today, but it has emerged that thousands across the continent have failed to meet the deadline. Caged: Farmers across Europe have ignored the ban . Some 60 per cent of all pig meat sold in the high street and through restaurants is imported, suggesting at least some will be from illegal foreign factory farms. In natural conditions, sows live in small groups with their young and will spend much of their day foraging and rooting for food. Factory farming methods have brought the breeding of supersize pigs that find it difficult to move and bear little resemblance to their wild ancestors. The pregnant sows turn out vast litters of piglets to be reared for meat and farmers developed a system of cages to restrict their movement. These are so narrow that the sows cannot turn around or move more than 18 inches forwards or backwards. This system has been recognised as cruel for many years, not least because pigs are highly intelligent creatures and are denied any semblance of a natural existence. The cramped conditions mean the animals suffer from severe psychological and physical harm. Cruel: Farming minister David Heath said sow stalls are cruel and said shoppers want to know where their meat comes from . Farmers across the EU were given 11 years notice that the ban would come into effect in January 2013, however they and their governments have failed to meet the deadline. Data published by the European Commission in December revealed that only one third of French farms have removed the cages. At the same time around half of German farms still use them and some 43per cent of those in Ireland. Other countries unable to meet the deadline include Belgium, Italy, the Netherlands and Spain. British farmers are at a commercial disadvantage because it costs more to rear pigs without using the cages. British farming minister, David Heath, said: ‘Sow stalls are cruel, they restrict the sow to such an extent that she can’t turn around for almost her entire life. ‘Shoppers care about where their meat comes from and what conditions the animals are reared in.’ He said responsibility for enforcing the ban is up to the European Commission, however this is unlikely to trigger any meaningful sanctions. Sow stalls were banned in Britain in 1999 because they caused psychological and physical harm to pigs (file picture) Britain’s National Pig Association estimates that around 40,000 ‘illegal’ pigs an hour will be entering the European food chain in January. It predicted bacon, ham and pizzas containing their meat will reach our supermarkets, corner shops and restaurants. NPA chairman, Richard Longthorp, said: ‘This makes a mockery of Europe’s animal welfare legislation. ‘Shoppers will need to be very careful about what they choose from supermarket shelves and when eating out in restaurants.’ The organisation is advising consumers to buy British bacon as the only guarantee of avoiding meat from the cage system. Chief executive of Compassion in World Farming, Philip Lymbery, said there is ‘no excuse’ for the failure of farmers to miss the cage ban deadline. He urged all British stores and producers to boycott pork from countries which fail to impose a total ban on the cages. Jamie Oliver has slammed the sow stalls as worse that battery chicken cages. He said: ‘In my view, it’s pretty inhumane. A pig can stand up, it can sit down, but it can’t turn around and it can’t scratch itself. And basically they’ll eat in one end and s--- out the other, and they’ve got nothing to do.’","The ban on sow stalls comes into force in EU today .

The U.S. National Transportation Safety Board has opened an investigation into the fire on a Boeing Co 787 Dreamliner aircraft at Boston's Logan International Airport on Monday, the agency said. The fire marks the fourth mechanical problem in as many weeks for Boeing's new problem-plagued Dreamliner 787. A mechanic inspecting the Japan Airlines Co Ltd jet discovered smoke in the cockpit while performing a routine post-flight inspection. Passengers had just exited the plane 15 minutes before the blaze broke out. WATCH VIDEO BELOW . Boston firefighters work to douse a fire in a Japan Airlines 787 Dreamliner's cargo hold .

'Passengers were in no danger as this event had happened at least 15 minutes after they deplaned,' Donahue said. The . fire is the latest reported mechanical failure in a string of incidents . affecting the Dreamliner, which was also plagued by production problems . that delayed initial delivery by 3-1/2 years. The design project began in the late 1990s. Boeing finally rolled out its first Dreamliner last year. There are currently 13 Dreamliners in service. The small explosion caused a fire but no passengers were hurt . The U.S. jet maker's shares fell more than 3 percent to $75.34 on the news.

A gunman who carried out the 'cold-blooded execution' of a sleeping man as he lay alongside his girlfriend and his young son has been jailed for life with a minimum term of 30 years. Father-of-three Lee Gray, 32, was killed with a single bullet to the back of the head fired by Martin Fieldhouse, 29, in a case of mistaken identity. Fieldhouse intended to kill his brother Michael who had knocked him out cold in a fight a few hours earlier and towards whom he felt 'sheer hatred'. Murderer: Martin Fieldhouse, 29, pictured left, shot 32-year-old Lee Gray, right, in the back of the head while he was asleep when he in fact intended to kill his own brother . As the guilty murder verdict was announced by the jury foreman at Sheffield Crown Court, Michael Fieldhouse, who was in the public gallery, shouted 'yes' and clapped and grinned at his brother in the dock. Martin Fieldhouse shouted back: 'I will see you in jail one day.' Michael responded: 'I f***ing hope so.' Fuelled by drink, cocaine and cannabis, Martin Fieldhouse sneaked into Mr Gray’s home at 6.30am and expected to find Michael who had temporarily been sleeping in the conservatory, the court heard. When he was not there he crept upstairs and in the darkness saw a man’s body in a bedroom and wrongly assumed it was his brother. He shot Mr Gray with a .410 sawn-off single barreled shotgun as he slept with his girlfriend Keeley Jones, 27, and his three-year-old son between them. Neither Miss Jones or the boy were awoken by the sound of the shot because it was muffled by being fired in direct contact with Mr Gray’s skull. Asleep: Keeley Jones was sleeping next to her boyfriend Lee Gray when he was shot in the back of the head by Martin Fieldhouse . After the murder, Mr Fieldhouse contacted his ex-partner to help him dispose of the gun and he admitted that 'he had shot his brother Mick.' After the hearing Michael Fieldhouse, 35, a father-of-three said: 'I’m really pleased for his mum Annette, 53. She wouldn’t come to the trial and has washed her hands of him. She never wants to see him again. 'I think he did it out of jealousy. I . have given that kid everything such as money but we have never seen eye . to eye for a long time. 'I hoped we would be close one day but now it will never happen. 'I don’t hate him, I just feel sorry for him. I was heading back to the house and would have been in the conservatory but changed my mind and went to see a girlfriend in Wakefield. 'If I had gone there I would now be dead instead of my best mate. Lee was my fishing and drinking and gym partner. We did everything together. I feel like I have lost a brother in Lee. 'I hope Martin rots in prison. I never want to see him again. I shouted I hoped to see him inside because if I did get in there I would smash him to bits. 'Martin’s girlfriend had been saying for a year he wanted to kill me. He thinks he’s a big man but he’s not. The whole family will cut him off now. He won’t get any family visiting him inside.' Martin Fieldhouse, of, Athersley South, Barnsley had denied murdering Mr Gray at his home in Worsbrough Dale, Barnsley on March 5, 2011. He claimed it was his brother who killed Mr Gray in a dispute over an £80,000 drug debt owed by Mr Gray but the jury at Sheffield Crown Court found Martin guilty. He also said Michael Fieldhouse tried to . persuade Mr Gray to having been the driver of a car involved in a . near-fatal collision the previous evening to wipe the debt clear and . when Mr Gray refused, Michael Fieldhouse decided to kill him. The . court heard that the Fieldhouses had a stormy relationship over many . years. They are half brothers and Martin Fieldhouse said his brother . used to give him serious beatings and their mother viewed Martin as the . 'golden boy' of the family. There had been a major falling-out after . Martin Fieldhouse claimed his brother had slept with his girlfriend who . was 'the only girl he ever loved' and Michael or someone on his behalf . had once shot him in the stomach. Investigation: Police cordoned off the scene after the fatal shooting in Worsborough, South Yorkshire, where Lee Gray was found with a gunshot wound to the head . Despite a brief reconciliation, the Fieldhouse brothers fought outside a nightclub and Martin was knocked out cold. Just a few hours later he armed himself and drove to Mr Gray’s house, entering through the unlocked conservatory door. He shot Mr Gray once to the back of the head before leaving . the house and driving off at speed. Martin Fieldhouse afterwards told a friend: 'I’ve gone and shot our Mick'. He said he had found his brother in bed with Miss Jones and shot him. Scene: Martin Fieldhouse sneaked into Mr Gray's home where he expected to find his brother sleeping in the conservatory . The murder was only discovered when Keeley Jones woke up and rang the emergency services at 6.57am. Miss Jones told the court: 'I did not hear a gunshot'. She sensed a burning smell and awoke to find her lover covered in blood. She only found out from the police later that he had been shot. She said: 'I couldn’t believe it. With him being in a car crash it could have been a haemorrhage or someone might have bashed him on the head.' A firearms expert concluded that the . firing of the gun in contact with the head 'could result in a . significant reduction in the noise of the discharge with the skull . acting as an effective expansion chamber for the discharge gases.' Michael Fieldhouse told the court he was in bed with a girlfriend at the time of the murder. He said of Martin: 'He has always been a bum. Nobody liked him, nobody ever has.' Martin Fieldhouse claimed in police . interviews that he had been shot in the stomach . with a shot gun in 2006 'either by or on behalf of his brother.' Judge Mr Justice Simon said the murder was pre-planned and the victim was asleep in bed at the time. He told Martin Fieldhouse: 'You were so hyped up you scarcely noticed who you were shooting and mistook Lee Gray for your brother. 'You intended the cold-blooded execution of your brother and you carried out the cold-blooded execution of Lee Gray against whom you had no grudge.'","Sleeping woman and child in bed next to him didn't hear a sound as shotgun was held so close to his skull when it was fired .
The intended target was actually the alleged shooter's brother, as the two family members shared years of animosity and violence .

'It was a clear conflict of interest for USADA. We had no . hesitation in rejecting that offer,' adding the amount was 'in excess of $150,000'. When Pelley said they learned it had been a $250,000 donation, Tygart said: 'It was around that ballpark.' Armstrong's attorney, Tim Herman, denied such an offer was made, saying: 'No truth to that story. First Lance heard of it was today. He never made any . such contribution or suggestion.' Armstrong once gave the International Cycling Union, a regulatory body for his sport, a gift of $100,000. The U.S. Department of Justice is . considering whether to join a federal whistle-blower lawsuit filed by . former Armstrong teammate Floyd Landis alleging fraud against the U.S. Postal Service during the years the agency sponsored Armstrong's teams. Tygart said the Justice Department refuses to charge Armstrong for using illegal substances to enhance his performance and will not share the results of the investigation with the USADA. Tune . into CBS's 60 minutes sports on Wednesday night at 10pm for the full . report. Armstrong's attorney, Tim Herman, denied such an offer was made, saying: 'No truth to that story. First Lance heard of it was today. He never made any such contribution or suggestion' The CEO describes Armstrong and his . team of doctors, coaches and riders as similar to a 'mafia' that kept . their secret for years and intimidated riders into silently following . their illegal methods. He said the riders were the victims, forced to choose between following the doping program or being off the team. It was rumored at the weekend that . Armstrong was considering coming clean about the doping - a sharp change . of course after years of denials . The New York Times, citing anonymous . sources, reported late on Friday that Armstrong has told associates he . was thinking about the move. But . his attorney said the cyclist hasn't reached out to USADA chief . executive or David Howman, director general of the World Anti-Doping . Agency. Public confessions and apologies have been the route of redemption for several athletes who have gotten in trouble. For example, Tiger Woods said he was . sorry for cheating on his wife in televised speech, and baseball slugger . Mark McGwire eventually admitted to steroid use. Yet Armstrong faces . serious legal entanglements those megastars didn't, and a confession to . doping could end up complicating matters for Armstrong - not making them . easier. A Dallas-based promotions company has . also said it wants to recover several million dollars paid to Armstrong . in bonuses for winning the Tour de France. And the British newspaper The . Sunday Times is suing to recover about $500,000 paid to Armstrong to . settle a libel lawsuit. Despite damning evidence Armstrong has yet to admit any wrongdoing including partaking in doping or offering a six-figure donation to the USADA . Armstrong has testified under oath . that he never used performance-enhancing drugs, which could . theoretically lead to charges if he confessed. Former U.S. track star . Marion Jones spent several months in federal prison for lying to . investigators about her drug use. And after so many years of vehement . denials and sworn statements that he never doped, at this point, Armstrong would not gain anything from the confession. Gene Grabowski, executive vice . president of Levick, a Washington, D.C.-based crisis and issues . management firm, said 'it may be too little, too late because he's been . denying it for so long.' A confession would only work to . salvage Armstrong's reputation if he accepted full responsibility and . blamed no one else, Grabowski said. And it would have to include some . public act of atonement. 'If he does all three, he has a shot,' Grabowski said. 'You have to show people you are willing to pay a price.' The New York Times reported the . 41-year-old Armstrong may be considering a confession in an attempt to . reduce his lifetime ban from cycling and Olympic sport so he can return . to competing in triathlons and elite running events. Armstrong lost most of his personal . sponsorship worth tens of millions of dollars after USADA issued its . report and he left the board of the Livestrong cancer-fighting charity . he founded in 1997. He is still worth about a reported $100 million. Livestrong might be one reason to . issue an apology. The charity supports cancer patients and still faces . an image problem because of its association with its famous founder. And if Armstrong did confess, the corporate sponsors who abandoned him might support him again, Grabowski said. Armstrong was accused last October of running 'the most sophisticated, professionalized and successful doping program that sport has ever seen' 'They'll do what the public does,' Grabowski said. Betsy Andreu, the wife of former . Armstrong teammate Frankie Andreu, was one of the first to publicly . accuse Armstrong of using performance-enhancing drugs. She dismissed a potential confession from Armstrong as self-serving and too late. 'Sorry, your chance is over. You're . banned for life. It's not with an asterisk, that because you are Lance . Armstrong you get to come back,' Andreu said. 'He does not belong in . sport.' According to the code, an athlete might be eligible for a reduced punishment if he fully confesses and details how he doped, who helped him dope and how he got away with doping. Armstrong has been keeping a low profile since doping revelations ruined his once illustrious career and reputation. In November he was spotted canoeing in the warm Pacific waters just off Hawaii. The holiday island has become a regular destination for Armstrong to seek refuge, as he throws himself into training for Ironman Triathlon events. An Ironman Triathlon consists of a . 2.4-mile swim, a 112-mile bicycle ride and a marathon 26.2-mile run, . raced in that order and without a break.

Pride: Catherine Zeta Jones has donated money for the lost palace of Welsh prince Llywelyn the Great . Hollywood star Catherine Zeta Jones has given a boost to efforts to preserve the site of the 'lost palace' of ancient Welsh princes. Catherine, 43, made a 'substantial' donation to a trust bidding to buy up farmland thought to be the site where the last independent rulers of Wales had their royal residence. The 700-year-old lost palace of Llywelyn the Great and his grandson Llywelyn the Last is believed to have stood in what is now mostly fields. And now the Garth Celyn Trust plans to erect a public monument to the Welsh princes at the farmland in Bangor, North Wales. Trustee Paul Martin Remfry said: 'The home of the Welsh princes of Wales, has been ignored for far too long. 'The trustees are delighted that Catherine Zeta-Jones is taking a personal interest in the work of the trust. 'Her involvement will undoubtedly help to raise the profile of this Welsh project internationally. He added: 'The historical and . archaeological evidence is overwhelming and we want to ensure its . guaranteed preservation for the benefit of present and future . generations.' Former Monty Python star Terry Jones is also keen on backing efforts to buy the 29 acres of land from the current owners. The ancient palace was, according to legend, situated at the place where an mansion called Pen-y-Bryn - dating back to 1624 itself - now stands. While the stories told locally were sometimes doubted by historians, a number of archaeological digs were carried out over the past few years suggesting that there was indeed a large complex of buildings on the site, including an impressive great hall, supporting the idea that Garth Celyn was indeed the location of a palace. It seems to have been one of the final strongholds of the independent princes of Wales, as Llywelyn the Last spent time there before his death at the decisive Battle of Orewin Bridge in 1282, which handed control of the country to England's King Edward I. The mansion's current occupier Kathryn Gibson said: 'The locals have always called the house . Llewelyn's Tower and it seems this local lore has been handed down over . the centuries. 'It's great that Catherine Zeta Jones is showing an interest.' Majestic: Pen-y-Bryn, which dates back to 1624 and is known locally as Llewelyn's Tower . The landscape of Garth Celyn in north Wales is now the site of a Tudor manor house - but in the medieval period, it is believed to have been home to the last independent princes of Wales. One of the princes to have maintained a palace there was Llywelyn the Great (pictured right on his deathbed in 1240), probably the most powerful ruler in Wales's history, who successfully resisted efforts by King John and Henry III to expand their English kingdom into Wales during the early 13th century. His grandson, known as Llywelyn the Last, is recorded as sending letters from Garth Celyn, which appears to have been one of the final strongholds of his vanishing lands. However, Llywelyn was killed at the Battle of Orewin Bridge in 1282, leading to the takeover of Wales by Edward I and its subsequent absorption into the English kingdom. The conquest of Wales brought an end to the royal connections of Garth Celyn, and historians have since doubted that it was in fact the spot where Llywelyn the Great held court - but recent archaeological digs proved that a great hall once stood on the site, bolstering its claims to palatial status.","Star donates undisclosed sum to buy land for monument to Llywelyn princes .

Tranquil: Shoppers will be asked to leave their shoes and mobile phones at the door to fully embrace the tranquil space . According to Selfridges creative director Alannah Weston, the room 'invites customers to find a moment of peace in a world where we are bombarded by a cacophony of information and stimulation.' WWD reports. The space will include meditation sessions and headspace pods as well as a Quiet Shop, which will sell un-branded products to promote considered shopping. Shoppers will also have the chance to purchase edits of pieces from spring ready-to-wear collections from clothing labels like Acne, Maison Martin Margiela and Jil Sander.","Shoppers to leave shoes and mobiles at door .

"By . Meghan Keneally . PUBLISHED: . 12:31 EST, 10 January 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 12:31 EST, 10 January 2013 . The husband of the Sandy Hook Elementary School principal who was killed in the shooting has retired from his job at the local middle school as he braces for life without his wife. George Hochsprung met his wife Dawn when they both worked at Rogers Park Middle School- she as the assistant principal and he as the seventh grade math teacher- before she left to head up the elementary school. Though he is 70-years-old, and well over the state’s average retirement age of 59, his move was unexpected but not surprising given the shooting. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Emotional: George got choked up and Erica began weeping during an interview about the principal's life . ‘His wife — she was that type of educator who gave her life for her kids,’ Danbury superintendent Sal Pascarella told The Hartford Courant. ‘George was that type of educator.’ He did not release a public statement after he decided to leave his job, but he did speak out immediately after the December 14 shooting and he was understandably emotional. 'Dawn and I built this beautiful house in the Adirondacks, our dream,' Mr Hochsprung told CNN. 'And the dream was a chronological dream it was going to be Dawn's house: I was going to die because I'm much older than Dawn, it was going to be Dawn's house. Happy: George Hochsprung said he and wife Dawn planned to spend . years together at a house they had built . 'Dawn's grandchildren and all these children could use the house on the lake and it would be wonderful.’ The Hochsprung family is made up of George's three daughters from his first marriage, Dawn's two daughters from her first marriage, and their collective 11 grandchildren. 'We built rooms downstairs for kids and it was going to be Dawn's house ultimately, with all the children. And now it's me - I don't think I can do that,' he said last month. One thing the family has to look forward to, however, is Mrs Hochsprung's daughter Erica Lafferty's wedding this summer. She and her fiance appeared in several television interviews in the wake of the shooting, talking about the life Dawn lived. 'I had a really hard time not being mad about it but that's who she was,' Lafferty said of the way that Dawn tried to stop the shooter. Support: Lafferty, who weds this summer, appeared on the show with her fiance, Christopher Smegielski . Where they met: George Hochsprung was teaching middle school math when he met Dawn (right) who was an assistant principal at the middle school at the time, before she left to work at Sandy Hook Elementary School . 'She faced every single problem that she ever had in her life head on. 'My cousin referred to her as a . 'bull' yesterday. There's no stopping Dawn when she has a mission. She . gets it done and she gives it everything she has.' As Lafferty struggled to control her tears, her fiance stood beside her. 'For some reason Dawn loved me and it's my job now to be there for her daughter,' Smegielski said. 'I accept that job with open arms and I'll be there for her in any way possible.' Tales of her heroism are helping Mrs Hochsprung's relatives process their grief, but only slightly. 'Dawn put herself in jeopardy and I . have been angry about that - angry - until just now, today, when I met . the two women who she told to go under shelter while she confronted the . gunman and she could have avoided that, but she didn't and I knew she . wouldn't,' Mr Hochsprung said. 'I'm not angry anymore, I'm just very sad.' Proud moment: Obama holds Dawn Hochspring's granddaughter as he visits Newtown on Sunday . Devastated: Her daughter tweeted the picture and expressed her grief at losing her mother . During the shooting, Dawn 'ran out, . and actually tried to subdue the killer. I don't know where that comes . from, Dawn was five-foot-two.' Since the Danbury Board of Education . officially accepted Mr Hochsprung’s resignation on Wednesday night, it . is now teachers who are upset over the departure of an accomplished . colleague. ‘He was one of the most creative people you ever were to meet. He knows his content, but connects with kids,’ Mr Pascarella said of Mr Hochsprung, who taught for 40 years and four months. ‘You just can’t replace him,’ he said to The Courant.

Nick Clegg will appear on LBC 97.3 every Thursday morning, in an attempt to find out what people are thinking . Nick Clegg is to host a weekly radio phone-in an extraordinary attempt to win over voters as Lib Dem strategists warn they have a year to turn the party’s poll ratings around. In an unprecedented move for a party leader, the Deputy Prime Minister is to take calls from listeners every Thursday to find out what ‘people are thinking’. Named 'Call Clegg' the weekly show is a massive gamble and could see the Lib Dem boss berated for every government gaffe and unpopular policy in the news. Tory MPs branded the show 'bizarre' and claimed he would spend more time answering questions on the radio than from MPs in the Commons. It comes as Mr Clegg has been put on notice that he only has until the end of 2013 to rescue dozens of his MPs from wipeout. The bizarre move to swap the Despatch Box for the DJ's studio also risked over-shadowing the coalition's Mid-Term Review, which is supposed to present a united front with the Conservatives. Mr Clegg, who celebrates his 46th birthday today, staged a joint press conference with David Cameron yesterday afternoon, setting out a raft of new policies to be implemented before the 2015 election. But the decision to announce that he will be putting himself at the mercy of radio listeners will be seen as an attempt to distance himself from the coalition. Mr Clegg, who has seen his party over-taken in the polls by the UK Independence Party, hopes to turn his ratings around by appearing on London's LBC 97.3 radio station every Thursday morning. Aides say he is 'comfortable with the format' which will see him spend half an hour every week answering calls, texts and emails. It means he will spend two hours-a-month responding to questions on the radio, three times the 40 minutes he spends dealing with oral questions at the Despatch Box as Deputy Prime Minister. Call Clegg will be hosted by LBC presenter Nick Ferrari, who hols regular phone-ins with London Mayor Boris Johnson . Tory MP Ian Liddel-Grainger said: . 'Having sat and listened to him at Deputy PM's Questions, he has never . answered a question yet so he isn't likely to break the habit of a . lifetime on the radio. 'Why . doesn't he just get on with the job? He is completely invisible anyway, . so it's a good job it's on the radio not the television because viewers . wouldn't be able to see him.' Tory MP Peter Bone said the idea of the Call Clegg show was ‘bizarre’. ‘The public will get more chance to . question him than MPs. I would have thought he should be spending his . time as Deputy Prime Minister supporting the Prime Minister in his . activities. ‘I am quite amazed that he has got enough time to go off and do a radio programme every Thursday.’ Nick Clegg is not the first politician to use TV and radio shows to broaden his appeal, but not all have been successful. Tory MP Nadine Dorries entered the I’m A Celebrity jungle in November, claiming she was going where the voters are and would highlight important policies like lowering the abortion limit. Instead she was seen eating camel toe and was the first star to be kicked off the show in a public vote. Ken Clarke, the former Tory chancellor who joined the coalition Cabinet, hosted nine series of his Radio 4 series Jazz Greats. Vince Cable, the Lib Dem Business Secretary, scored an impressive 36-40 when he appeared on the Christmas special of Strictly Come Dancing in 2010. Lib Dem MP Adrian Sanders moonlights as a rock DJ on community station Riviera FM in his Torbay constituency. But he risked controversy when he claimed rock giants Muse were not the best bad to emerge from the Bay, preferring instead 70s act Wishbone Ash. Transport minister Norman Baker hosts Anything Goes on Seahaven FM,  promising ‘an eclectic mix of jazz, blues, swing, country and a lot more besides, from the 1920s to the present day, with the emphasis on the laid back’. The Lib Dem admits his records ‘are a little bit offbeat’. Respect MP George Galloway did little to improve the reputation of politicians when he entered the Celebrity Big Brother house in 2006, donning a red cat suit to purr and lick milk from the hand of actress Rula Lenska. He later hosted a show on TalkSport for six years until 2012. Mr Clegg will be co-hosting with LBC . presenter Nick Ferrari, following in the footsteps of London Mayor Boris . Johnson who also takes part in regular phone-ins on the station. ‘I'm doing this because I don't think politicians get to hear enough from people directly,’ Mr Clegg said. ‘You can't do the right thing in government unless you keep in touch with how people are thinking and feeling. 'Nick . Ferrari is known as the interviewer that all politicians fear. He can . be very tough but he's generally fair, very well informed and I hope . we’ll make a good combination for the show we're doing together.' But Labour MP John Mann said: 'It . shows how irrelevant he is to the running of the country. My question to . ask Nick is: What's the point of Nick Clegg? Is he Kilroy in disguise?' In a Mail on Sunday opinion poll . yesterday the Lib Dems were on 11 per cent, well behind UKIP which has . surged to 16 per cent on the back of rising dissatisfaction with the . government’s stance on Europe. Lib Dems have repeatedly stressed that the five-year parliament gives them chance to reverse their woeful ratings. However, senior party figures now admit that without a major change in fortunes in the next 12 months, Mr Clegg could be in trouble. ‘We have kept saying we have got . plenty of time but we’ve really got to see things turning around this . year,’ a senior Lib Dem source told MailOnline. ‘If we get to the end of 2013 and the polls are still bad for Nick, we will be in trouble.’ Lib Dem insiders say they hope the clips of Mr Clegg's show will be used across the Global Radio network, which owns LBC as well as stations like Heart and Classic FM. Mr Clegg's latest attempt to reach out to voters comes after his YouTube video apology for promising to vote against tuition fees was remixed, ridiculed and released as a single, reaching 143 in the charts. By putting himself at the mercy of angry voters every week, Mr Clegg's attempt to connect with voters could backfire. 'It won't be faultless every week,' an advisor said. 'That's the risk of doing live radio.' Richard Park, Global Radio’s director of broadcasting,  said: 'Once again, LBC 97.3 delivers a first, as we welcome the Deputy Prime Minister to London’s biggest conversation. 'No other station offers its listeners such unique access to a senior member of Government. This will be must-listen radio.' The show, for which Mr Clegg is not being paid, starts this Thursday from 9am. The decision may go down badly with Mr Clegg’s constituents in Sheffield Hallam, where he has been MP since 2005. Local Liberal Democrats blamed him for losing control of the city council to Labour last year. Paul Blomfield, Labour MP for Sheffield Central said: ‘That is extraordinary. I think that his constituents in Sheffield are right to ask why he’s chosen to engage in a conversation with London voters, on a regional programme every week, instead of the people of the city he purports to represent. 'Is he too unnerved by what he knows he would hear from Sheffield voters? ‘Also I would have thought that at a time when working families are facing rising costs, and tightening budgets, he ought to be concentrating on his day job of running the country instead of doing a talk show with London radio listeners.’ David Laws, Lib Dem education minister and a key ally of Mr Clegg, insisted that despite wofeul poll ratings and local election results, the party's remaining supporters are 'realistic' about the need for difficult decisions. 'Lib Dems, like everybody else, can count. They can count that when we came to power we had a deficit of £160 thousand million pounds,' he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. 'Our supporters are realistic about this. They know there are tough times. They do not believe that every decision made by the Government in these circumstances can be an easy and popular one. 'We are still united as a party in believing that we need to be in coalition to deliver for the country, put our policies into practice, and also because the electorate in May 2010 did not give a majority to any one party.' Mr Cameron and Mr Clegg today sought to prevent the break-up of the coalition for another two and a half years, unveiling a raft of new ideas to last them until 2015. Making a rare joint appearance in Downing Street, the Tory and Lib Dem leaders dismissed calls from their backbenchers for an early 'divorce' to insist their commitment to the power-sharing deal was 'unwavering'. Launching the 52-page Mid-Term Review, the two men hailed their progress in tackling the vast debts inherited from the Labour party and pledged action on cutting childcare costs, increasing the state pension and investing in new roads, rail links and affordable homes.","Lib Dem leader to appear on LBC 97.3 every Thursday .

Choosing the best way to propose is never easy - but in the modern age, with twitter and other social networks running much of our social lives, it can be even tougher deciding how to pop the question and keep your plans quiet. However, for Guy Malachi, an Israeli entrepreneur, Facebook's status updates gave him the perfect vehicle to propose. Mr Malachi, 36, decided to propose to girlfriend Eva, who is 30, using Facebook in a unique way. Guy Malachi, right, used Facebook's status updates to propose to girlfriend Eva, lift - hacking her laptop so she was asked if she wanted to change her relationship status . 'When I decided to propose to my girlfriend I knew it would be geeky,' he said . 'Not Star Wars geeky, I'm not that hardcore, but something geeky nonetheless. 'I threw around a few ideas, I knew I wanted to surprise her out of the blue, I wanted to do something that required investment (and not just half-ass it), but I didn't want it to be too grandiose (we're both not into those kinds of things). Mr Malachi eventually decided on Facebook, and set about writing some code that would hijack her laptop, allowing him to fool her into thinking she was receiving real Facebook messages when, in fact, they were written by him.

He then asked her to confirm her relationship status - with a menu that showed Married, whatever menu option was chosen . Each time Eva selected single, it showed her this message .

'She had no idea till that second what was going on - luckily for me, she said yes!' 'A few minutes of mushiness ensued while we collected ourselves and indulged in the moment, and then I explained to her how the whole thing worked. 'To top all this off, the next thing I obviously had to do was update my Twitter with the good news and that was how my Mum found out I proposed. 'When I called her to tell her the good news she answered saying ""I need to discover on Twitter that you proposed?"". She was a great sport about it.'

Property prices could take another eight years to recover from the recession and regain their 2007 value, according to forecasts by an estate agent. Homeowners in Wales, North Yorkshire and the North West will wait the longest to see the value of their property return to pre-recession value according to Knight Frank. In Wales, prices won't return to their average peak of £154,696 until 2021 with the current market value more than £20,000 down to less than £132,000. Recession hit: Property prices in some areas could take until 2021 to reach pre-recession levels according to estate agent Knight Frank . In both Yorkshire and the North West, prices will not hit 2007 heights again until 2020, in what is likely to be the slowest housing market recovery in economic history. London will see the quickest recovery, with prices expected to return to their 2007 £303,739 average as early as next year. The capital is still regarded as something of a property hotspot in the global market with properties in prime locations rising by more than half since 2009 and up nine per cent during 2012. Overall, there is something of a north-south divide, with prices in the South East to hit peak levels by 2016 and East Anglia by 2017. Grainne Gilmore, head of UK residential research at Knight Frank, said: 'Some five years after the start of the financial crisis the housing sector in Britain still does not bear the hallmarks of a fully functioning market. 'Transaction levels have roughly halved since the last market peak in 2007 and are 35 per cent below the 20 year average. 'First time buyers and those further up the ladder are struggling with tighter mortgage lending.' Property prospects . Liam Bailey, head of residential research at the company, said that the double-dip recession and the threat of a triple dip, has helped to 'weigh on purchaser sentiment'. UK-wide, Knight Frank expects it to be 2019 before the nationwide housing market is up to speed, with a 2 per cent increase in sales expected for 2013. Last year wasn't all bad for homeowners depending on where you live and what type of house you own. Those with homes close to the see saw values rise by 56 per cent with the luxury property market seeing price gains of 45 per cent in 2012. London's continuing property boom did not just extend to prime central locations in 2012, with areas such as Wandsworth, Hampstead and Richmond seeing price increases of five per cent. Not coining it in: While London's property market seems to be going from strength to strength due to international demand, the rest of the UK is struggling . Despite . it more than likely being the slowest recovery for house prices from a . recession, the property market has not suffered as sharp a fall as . during recession in the early 1990s, when values dropped by a fifth. This time around, house prices have fallen an average of 12 per cent. Many . of those who bought property expecting a certain profitable return are . having to rethink their plans with the introduction of a seven per cent . rate of stamp duty in March not expected to help the market. Building . society Nationwide said last week that house prices had dropped by just . over a per cent in 2012, with a fall of 0.1 per cent in December alone. That fall reversed 2011's one per cent increase in house prices.

Jason MacLeod, 34, has avoided £2,000 of fines by appealing every parking ticket he has been issued with since 2010, at a cost of £10,000. The software developer says he disagrees with the 'principle' of the fines, claiming they are 'disproportionate.' 'Matter of principle': Porsche driver Jason MacLeod has avoided £2,000 of fines by appealing every parking ticket he has been issued with since 2010, but has finally been told to pay his latest one . Instead of just 'rolling over' like most drivers, he has researched legal technicalities, written extensive letters of explanation and contested his fines at tribunals. He has even brawled on the floor with a burly parking boss he confronted over his car being clamped. But Jason has now finally been ordered to pay out £790 after losing his appeal against a £50 excess charge for parking his Porsche without a ticket in a supermarket car park. Despite the set-back, he has vowed to continue fighting his parking penalties - and even plans to take his case to the crown court to appeal the fine. Jason, of Stratford, London, said: 'It is a matter of principle, the money is not an issue. I have got no problem paying a 60p parking ticket. 'It was a genuine mistake and now I have been stung for £790. I would have got less if I had broken someone’s nose. One-man war: Two years ago, Mr MacLeod grappled with a burly parking boss after trying to serve him court papers which showed the clamper owed him £400 in damages after a two-year row over a wheel clamping . Taking matters into his own hands: Mr MacLeod was pictured being thrown to the ground in the fight with parking enforcement firm boss Richard Rippon outside Mr Rippon's home in Poole, Dorset . 'If a proper crown court judge was to hear me put my arguments forward I think it would be a whole different playing field. Most people just roll over when they get a parking ticket. 'But I never intentionally park in the wrong place so if I think I have a case I appeal. I’ve known parking wardens stand over people’s cars waiting for the time on their ticket to run out. 'It’s frustrating as motorists are being levied excessive penalties for usually minor parking misdemeanours. The system is biased against them. But I’m not afraid to fight for it.' Huntingdonshire District Council accused the computer expert of parking his black Porsche Cayman S in Sainsbury’s car park without displaying a ticket last April. He was ordered to pay the excess charge of just £35, but refused and the total due on the notice rose to £50. Mr MacLeod still refused to pay and challenged the ticket in a hearing at Huntingdon Magistrates’ Court, on 20 December 2012. Painful reading: A list of just some of the parking fines Mr MacLeod has been hit with since 2001 . Ouch: He estimates the equivalent to half a working day in total is spent on each appeal . He told the court he thought he was . parked in an area separate to the supermarket car park that had no . restrictions, but the decision was awarded in favour of the district . council. Magistrates fined . the driver £400 and ordered him to pay £375 costs and a £15 victim after . being found guilty of the non-criminal, non-recordable motoring . offence. The failed appeal is the first time Jason has been ordered to pay a fine since 2010. Since . 2004, he has been issued with 67 parking tickets, of which 60 were from . councils, while the others were due to private firms. He . estimates the equivalent to half a working day in total - when he would . charge his executive rates as a consultant - is spent on each appeal. The lost time and other legal and administrative costs come to at least £10,000, just since 2010. Racking them up: Some of the 67 parking tickets Mr MacLeod has been issued with since 2004, of which 60 were from councils and the others from private firms . Over the last two years, Jason has appealed 35 parking fines and been successful 34 times. He has paid five of these up front then later written to claim a reimbursement. Jason has been successful in 26 of his . claims over the last two years and still has eight decisions pending - . which means he has yet to pay. Over the eight-year period, he has been clamped eleven times and his car has been towed twice. The technicalities he has used to appeal . the penalties include improper signage, faded road markings and wardens . operating beyond their jurisdiction. But he says the £2,100 he has saved by . not paying fines is unimportant next to the principle of wardens . 'actively trying' to catch drivers out. Mr . MacLeod, who earns a six-figure salary, said: 'If I genuinely break a . parking restriction then I am always happy to pay the fine. 'But I appeal most of them because I am a conscientious parker and always try and check the restrictions where I leave my car. 'If I get a fine it can be because the local signs or road markings are inadequate. 'Occasionally I have been less than five minutes late getting back to my car because I have been held up. 'Other times, I have been unloading my car, and once my car was even towed away after it had broken down. 'There is no leeway, or discretion, and lots of times I have seen wardens stood over my car waiting for the time on the ticket to run out. 'I know I’ve got a point because so many of my fines have been overturned.' In 2010 Jason was pictured being thrown to the ground by burly parking enforcement firm boss Richard Rippon. He was trying to serve the parking boss court papers which showed the clamper owed him £400 in damages after a two-year row over a wheel clamping. Jason rang Redroute Parking Management to pay a £125 fine he incurred in Reading in 2008 so the clamp could be removed from his car, but was asked for his name and address. When he refused to give his name and address, he was told a tow truck would remove his car and he would have to stump up a further £129 to cover the call-out charge. Jason paid the company a total of £254, but took the matter to Aldershot and Farnham County Court, Hants, which ruled in his favour and awarded £400 in damages. The driver then traced Mr Rippon to his home in Poole, Dorset, and tried to give him the enforcement papers when the pair became locked in a tussle. Mr Rippon, 50, claimed he acted in self-defence and was upset that Mr MacLeod was acting aggressively and taking pictures of him and his daughter. The money due to Jason under the court order was paid on the spot.","Jason MacLeod has dodged 35 parking tickets over the last two years alone .

Not only is the burgeoning population of wild deer a threat to UK woodland, the surge in the number of deer is also a hazard for drivers on our roads: . The incident comes as anew study claimed the thriving population of UK roe deer could be damaging the landscape of British woodland. Researchers discovered that areas with the most roe deer had the least shrub layer vegetation cover and fewer birds. The study results add fuel to the argument that more wild deer need to be culled to protect the environment. The species are also estimated to cause thousands of collisions on the roads each year. A team from the Food and Environment Research Agency (Fera) and Durham University found that an increase in the population of roe deer is possibly related to a decline in the diversity and cover of shrubs below the main canopy in forest areas.Wild deer have been roaming Britain for . around 6,000 years and it is estimated that there are currently around . two million of them.

David Cameron offered an olive branch to Christians last night, issuing the most overtly religious Christmas message by a prime minister in recent times. He quoted from the Gospel of St John in an apparent attempt to parade his religious credentials while controversy rages about his government’s plans to introduce gay marriage. Ministers have come under fire from churchmen and MPs over the plans, on which the Commons will vote in the New Year. Olive branch: David Cameron has issued the most overtly religious Christmas message by a PM in recent times in an apparent bid to defuse anger over plans for gay marriage . Mr Cameron has regularly ignored advice that politicians in the modern age should not ‘do God’. But the Prime Minister went further than ever last night when he quoted from the Bible, referring to Jesus as ‘the light of all mankind’ and the ‘Prince of Peace’. He spoke about the ‘extraordinary year’ featuring the ‘spectacular’ Olympics and the Diamond Jubilee, when ‘we cheered our Queen to the rafters and praised the efforts of the Armed Forces’. But the most striking passage of his message came when he turned to the meaning of Christmas. ‘Christmas gives us the opportunity to remember the Christmas story – the story about the birth of Jesus Christ and the hope that he brings to the countless millions who follow him,’ he said. ‘The Gospel of John tells us that in this man was life, and that his life was the light of all mankind, and that he came with grace, truth and love. Indeed, God’s word reminds us that Jesus was the Prince of Peace.’ He concluded: ‘So however you celebrate this time of year, it is my hope and prayer that you have a happy and peaceful Christmas.’ Criticism: Churchmen have accused the Prime Minister of being out of touch with the 'vast majority of practising religious people' Mr Cameron’s message appeared designed to defuse anger at his decision to push forward plans for gay marriage despite heavy criticism. The Bishop of Leicester has accused him of being out of touch with the ‘vast majority of practising religious people’ despite assurances that no churches will be forced to carry out such ceremonies. In a speech last year Mr Cameron said the values of the Bible ‘go to the heart’ of what it means to be British, although he admitted he was no more than a ‘vaguely practising’ Christian ‘full of doubts’ about theological issues. He also used his Christmas message, to be published today, ‘to pay particular tribute to our brave servicemen and women who are overseas helping bring safety and security to all of us at home; their families who cannot be with them over the holidays; and to all the dedicated men and women in the emergency services who are working hard to support those in need’. He added: ‘When we are celebrating with family and friends, they and many others are all working on our behalf and deserve our thoughts and appreciation.’","Ministers have come under fire from churchmen and MPs over the plans .

A Utah family has adopted a four-year-old Down syndrome girl from Russia, just before President Vladimir Putin moved to ban U.S. citizens bringing the country's children to America. Heather and Jeremy Fillmore welcomed little Hazel into their home on Christmas Eve after fighting for almost a year to get her here. But they will be among the last of more than 60,000 American families to bring up a Russian child as their own as Russia signed a bill today outlawing the process. Putin's approval of the adoption ban will leave nearly 50 Russian children on the verge of adoption by U.S. families now stranded. Scroll down for video . Lucky: Heather and Jeremy Fillmore, left and right, welcomed little Hazel, centre, into their home on Christmas Eve just before the new ban on the adoption of Russian children by US families came in to force . The bill has angered Americans and . Russians who argue it victimises children to make a political point, . cutting off a route out of frequently dismal orphanages for thousands of . children. The measure is retaliation for the Magnitsky Act, legislation that calls for sanctions against Russian officials deemed . human rights violators, after Russia imprisoned lawyer Sergei Magnitsky, who later died, after uncovering a £143million fraud. The bill's signing coincides with a Moscow court acquitting the only official charged with his death. The Russian-language hashtag 'PutinEatsKids' was trending on Twitter just minutes after Putin signed it. Unicef . estimates that there are about 740,000 children not in parental custody . in Russia while about 18,000 Russians are on the waiting list to adopt a . child. The law also blocks dozens of Russian children now being adopted by American families from leaving the country. Siblings: Hazel, 4, pictured right with one of her new siblings, is settling in well to her new home in American Fork, Utah. Critics say many other Russian children have been denied a similar future due to Mr Putin's decision . Bittersweet: While being thrilled to have Hazel, pictured right, the Fillmore's are heartbroken that Russia has finalized a ban on Americans adopting Russian children . The . US is the biggest destination for adopted Russian children - more than . 60,000 of them have been taken in by Americans over the past two . decades. The . U.S. State Department says it regrets the Russian Parliament's decision . to pass the bill, saying it would prevent many children from growing up . in families. Amnesty International Europe and . Central Asia director John Dalhuisen said: 'This bill is frankly a . childish response to the Magnitsky Act. 'The Duma should be focusing its efforts on how it can strengthen Russian civil society, not weaken it.' Preempting criticism of the move, Putin promised measures to better care for his country's orphans. 'I . intend to sign also a presidential decree that will modify the support . mechanisms for orphaned children ... especially those who are in a . difficult situation, by that I mean in poor health,' Putin said. Critics of the bill say the Russian authorities are playing political games with the lives of children. The U.S. State Department repeated its concerns over the measure. 'Since 1992 American families have . welcomed more than 60,000 Russian children into their homes, and it is . misguided to link the fate of children to unrelated political . considerations,' State Department spokesman Patrick Ventrell said in a . statement. Ban: Russian President Vladimir Putin, pictured, has signed a bill banning Americans from adopting Russian children that has raised tensions between Moscow and Washington . Ventrell added that the United States was troubled by provisions in the bill that would restrict the ability of Russian civil society organizations to work with U.S. partners. Children in Russia's crowded and troubled orphanage system - particularly those with serious illnesses or disabilities - will have less of a chance of finding homes, and of even surviving, child rights advocates said. It took about 11 months for the Fillmores to bring Hazel home from Russia. She arrived at Salt Lake City International Airport at 11pm on Christmas Eve. 'It's been tough, but worth it, and to have her here and be part of our family, it's now great,' Jeremy Fillmore told the Deseret News. 'We feel like we're complete and we're excited to have her.' Children with disabilities are placed into institutions when they turn five years old, and they are taken off a database of orphaned children, so it makes it almost impossible to find them a permanent home, the Fillmores said. At the institutions, the basic needs of the children are met, but they are given no education or attention, they said. They found Hazel through a website that advocates for children with special needs called Reece’s Rainbow Down Syndrome Adoption Ministry. According to the newspaper, she was the second girl they adopted from Russia with the help of the website. Anya, who is now 7 years old, was adopted in March 2011. Nearly 50 children who were on the . verge of being adopted by Americans are expected to stay in Russia . despite the fact many of them have already been authorised by courts. 'We know a lot of families who have already been to Russia and have met their children,' Heather Fillmore said. Deep concerns: The U.S. State Department said it had 'deep concerns' about the welfare of more than 700,000 Russian children in orphanages, particularly those with disabilities like Hazel, pictured . Big brother: Hazel, 4, spent Christmas day getting to know her new family in Utah . 'You just don't know how, you feel like they're your children, and the thought of them being locked away in an institution for the rest of their lives is almost hard to even bear.' Fillmore told the Deseret News she fears for children with special needs.' 'It's just sickening,' she said. 'I don't even want to believe that it can happen because it's very personal to us. We know many families who are in the process to go to save these children from a horrible life. It just doesn't make any sense that the children are the ones that are suffering because of retaliation in politics.' Americans points to people like Jessica Long, who was given up shortly after birth by her parents in Siberia but was raised by adoptive parents in the United States and became a Paralympic swimming champion. However, the Russian authorities point to the deaths of 19 Russian-born children adopted by American parents in the past decade, and lawmakers named the bill after a boy who died of heat stroke in Virginia after his adoptive father left him locked in a car for hours. Putin reiterated Russian complaints that U.S. courts have been too lenient on parents in such cases, saying Russia has inadequate access to Russian-born children in the United States despite a bilateral agreement that entered into force on November 1. But Putin, who began a new six-year term in May and has searched for ways to unite the country during 13 years in power, suggested there were deeper motives for such a ban.

A study found that the typical adult gorges on the equivalent of 15 days' worth of food in just eight days between Christmas Eve and New Year's Day. Between Christmas Eve and Boxing Day alone, the average person consumed 15,000 calories, thanks to a turkey dinner with all the trimmings. Calorific: A turkey dinner with all the trimmings can contain up to 1,450 calories . And a further 18,000 calories will have been squeezed in by tomorrow, by quaffing an average of 16 cans of lager, nine glasses of wine and two glasses of Champagne on New Year's Eve. Second and third helpings add another 3,000 calories, while snacks - including chocolate, crisps and nuts - bring the total to a scale-busting 38,000 calories. The recommended daily calorie allowance for an eight-day period is approximately 20,000 for men, and roughly 16,000 for women. It means the average man and woman will consume up to double the recommended calorie intake every day of the holidays and gain up to 6lbs by early 2013. Tempting: Two portions of Christmas pudding with custard and brandy butter contain 1,174 calories . The figures were compiled in the run-up to Christmas by weight-loss experts Vitagetics, makers of the slimming pill Vita-Lean. One thousand adults were polled about their usual Christmas and New Year eating habits, and also recorded a breakdown of their proposed menus this year. A spokesman for Vita-Lean said: 'The Christmas period is all about indulgence, but it's easy to forget that over-indulgence is bad news for the waistline, and for our health.'

They were burnt down on December 30, just as they were being considered for inclusion on a heritage register. The remains of Ghost Gum trees, painted many times by the late Aboriginal artist Albert Namatjira, after they were destroyed by a suspicious fire, near to the outback town of Alice Springs . They were burnt down on December 30 just as they were being considered for inclusion on a heritage register . Police said they had no doubt the trees, which get their name because of their white, spooky bark were set alight by vandals. ‘This is a sad moment in our history,’ said Miss Alison Anderson, the Northern Territory’s Indigenous Advancement Minister. ‘These trees were a landmark and very special to Aboriginal people in the area. ‘In his watercolours Namatjira brought the beauty of the Central Australian landscape to the world and helped make it a symbol of Australian identity.’ The trees featured on a stamp and were also included in the song I Am Australian. Namatjira first came to the notice of Australian art circles in the late 1930s and by the late 1950s he had won international acclaim.

In Oxfordshire, a rift opened up along a road surface, exposing layers of earth to the shock of neighbours and road users. The route, which links Oxford to the nearby market town of Abingdon, was closed to traffic after it was torn apart by subsidence. A deluge of rain over the Christmas holidays was the final straw for the Oxford Road in Boars Hill, near Oxford, which is regularly used by traffic attempting to avoid the A34 dual carriageway. Cracks stretch to up to two-feet wide in places and the rural through-road has been closed and sealed off by engineers. The white centre lines were shifted over to one side as the road sank - and the damage could get even worse with forecasters predicting more downpours next week. Highways bosses have now been faced with having to replace the road surface entirely. 'It's obviously going to take some fixing,' said Owen Morton, spokesman for Oxford County Council. 'It's subsidence. There's been a lot of heavy rain and that can cause this sort of damage.' Environment Secretary Owen Paterson and members of the Environment Agency study the flood defences at Upton upon Severn, Worcestershire . Flood-hit communities will continue to get Government support but will have to wait a while longer for a deal to be done on affordable insurance cover, the Environment Secretary has said. Owen Paterson, who was touring flood defences in Worcestershire today, praised the response of emergency services and the Environment Agency for reacting 'heroically' to recent national flooding triggered by the wettest year on record. He said the Government had already committed to funding schemes protecting about 145,000 homes, and was putting more money into defences. 'Over the spending review period (to 2015) we had already pledged £2.71billion and on top of that the Chancellor already announced in his Autumn Statement a further £120million to protect a further 60,000 homes,' he said. Mr Paterson also said partnership schemes had raised another £72million from the private sector.However, he said there has been no deal done yet with the Association of British Insurers (ABI) over the issue of affordable flood insurance for householders in areas of high risk. Negotiations have been going on since last year to replace the current agreement, known as the Statement of Principles - which ends in July - but so far the Government and the ABI have been unable to come to terms. Mr Paterson said his colleague, Oliver Letwin, a Cabinet Office minister, met the director-general of the ABI before Christmas, 'and we await them coming back to us with a constructive proposal'. He added he was 'not going to negotiate in public' but said the Government wanted 'a system which is better, comprehensive, and which is affordable and does not burden the taxpayer'. Mr Paterson said making flood insurance affordable was 'a huge and complex problem' and he would not set a date for the conclusion of talks. We are confident we can reach a resolution,' he said. The £120million of funding - the first tranche of which will be released in the coming financial year - is split equally, with half going towards major flood defences that protect infrastructure, homes and businesses. The other £60million is being allocated through a partnership fund which allows businesses, councils and developers to pay towards some of the costs of defences. About 20 new schemes are already going ahead this year, in locations including Manchester, Louth and Warrington, said Pete Fox, the Environment Agency's head of strategy and investment. He said the additional government money would be allocated on a 'case-by-case basis' and areas would need to bid for the cash. 'We go to an area and look at the causes of flooding and then look to see if solutions can be provided for those causes,' he said. 'If councils want to go it alone we can offer them support, but it's a national pot of money and they'll be participating against everyone else for it.' Between 7,500 and 8,000 households have been flooded since July, culminating in the major flooding over Christmas and New Year. Mr Fox also said about 100,000 homes had been protected from incidences of flooding over the same period because of the construction of more defences, better weather forecasting, and closer working between the emergency services, councils and the agency, sparked by the huge floods of summer 2007.","Thirteen separate flood warnings were issued across the Yorkshire region .

The wife of a $1 million Chicago lottery winner who was poisoned with cyanide before he collected his winnings has revealed her husband was a 'good person' who didn't have any enemies. Shabana Ansari has opened up about losing 46-year-old Urooj Khan, who immigrated to the U.S. with from India in 1989. Describing Mr Khan as a hard-working, generous man who would send money to orphanages in their native country, Ms Ansari said her husband's death devastated her and added that she cannot fathom that he had any adversaries. 'I was shattered. I can't believe he's no longer with me,' she said, from one of the couple's three dry cleaners. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Foul play: A family member called police to say Khan had not suffered a 'natural death' after he had been buried. His body will now be exhumed to inspect the contents of his last meal . Fateful purchase: Khan spent $60 in June on two Illinois state lottery tickets. The second one of which proved to be a winning ticket . Habit: Khan was revealed to have spent up to $600 a day on scratchcards . 'I don't think anyone would have a bad eye for him or that he had any enemy,' Ms Ansari said, adding that she continues to work at the dry cleaner out of a desire to honor her husband and the businesses he built. Ms Ansari, 32, moved to the U.S. from India after marrying Khan 12 years ago. Mr Khan and his wife were born in Hyderabad, India, and their story is a typical immigrant's tale of settling in a new land with big dreams and starting a business. Their daughter, Jasmeen, is a student here. 'Work was his passion,' Ms Ansari said. 'I'm just taking care of his hard work.' Ms Ansari wouldn't talk about the mysterious circumstances of her husband's death, saying it was too painful. But she says she hopes the truth will come out in the homicide investigation. Mr Khan's death on July 20 was initially ruled a result of natural causes. A relative's request for a deeper . look resulted in the conclusion months later that the father-of-one was . poisoned as he was about to collect $425,000 in winnings. The relative, who called a medical . examiner demanding a fresh inquiry into the poisoning, 'didn't accept it was going to be a natural . death,' MailOnline revealed earlier today. In a dramatic phone call, Mr Khan's . family member flatly rejected the original ruling and ordered . investigators to have another look. Entrepreneur: Khan emigrated to the U.S. during the 1980s, and had saved enough to open three dry cleaning shops (pictured) on Chicago's Far North side . Now . after further tests revealed Mr Khan, of Chicago's North Side, died due . to cyanide poisoning his body is set to be exhumed - so his final meal . can be examined. Chicago police Superintendent Garry McCarthy told reporters on Tuesday that he had never seen anything like Mr Khan's case in his 32 years of policing in New York, New Jersey and now Chicago. 'So, I'm not going to say that I've seen everything,' Mr McCarthy said. Prosecutors, Chicago police and the Cook County Medical Examiner's Office are investigating Khan's death as a homicide, but they have not given any details or announced any suspects. MailOnline . has also revealed that according to a respected poison expert, Mr Khan . would have ingested the killer dose no more than an hour before he died. According . to a police report cited by the Chicago Tribune, that fateful day Mr . Khan arrived at his Chicago home with his wife, Ms Ansari, and daughter, . Jasmeen, and ate some dinner. He then went to bed before waking up screaming as his body was 'suffocated cell by cell.' Mr Khan won $1m on the Illinois State Lottery last June but went to collect his winnings on July 20. The . initial examination by the Cook County Medical examiner found he had . died of heart disease, or natural causes. Drugs like cyanide do not show . up on standard toxicology reports. However, after the intervention of a relative, a more thorough toxicology report was ordered. The cause of death has now been ruled as poisoning by cyanide and it is being treated as a homicide by Chicago police. The day after receiving a check for his winnings, Khan awoke screaming in pain in his bed at his Chicago home (pictured). An expert said this is caused when muscle contract suddenly as the poison kills you 'cell by cell' No signs of foul play: An initial autopsy on Khan performed by the Cook County Medical Examiner's Office found nothing awry . Cook County Medical Examiner Stephen . Cina told MailOnline: 'I believe they called up and said they wanted to . us to look into it further. 'They didn’t accept it was going to be a natural death.' Mr . Cina added that he hopes to exhume Mr Khan's body within ‘the next few . weeks’ from Chicago’s Rosehill Cemetery and that an analysis of the . content of his stomach could take place afterwards. Mr . Cina said: 'I have had one cyanide death in 4,500 autopsies so they are . unusual, as are exhumations. To have a case where there is both is very . unusual.' Mr Khan emigrated to the US during the . 1980s from India, and through hard work and discipline, saved up enough . cash to open first one and eventually three dry cleaning shops in . Chicago. Last June he paid . $60 for two lottery scratch-off tickets at a 7-Eleven convenience store near . his home and, upon scratching the second one, reportedly leaped in the . air and shouted, 'I hit a million!' Days . later, with his wife and daughter at his side at the same store, Mr . Khan gleefully accepted an oversized, mock check from lottery officials. At . the time, he said he was going to use the money to pay bills, donate to . St. Jude's Children's Hospital in Chicago and grow his dry-cleaning . business. After taxes, the prize money amounted to $425,000. Illinois State Lottery spokesman Mike Lang said that it was eventually cashed August 15 and that if a lottery winner dies, the money typically goes to his or her estate. He had recently returned to Chicago from the hajj pilgrimage to Saudi Arabia inspired to lead a better life and had sworn off buying lottery tickets - except just this once. His Islamic faith dictates that he should not even have been gambling in the first place. A good man: The cashier at the 7-Eleven where Khan bought his fateful lotto tickets said Khan was a 'gentle' man and a 'nice person' who cared for his family . Jimmy Goreel, 51, the manager of the . 7-Eleven store where Mr Khan bought the ticket, said that in 2011 Mr Khan . became ‘addicted’ to scratchcards and used to come in every day spending . up to $600 a time. He said: . 'Mr Khan would buy an entire book of scratchcards and would leave them . with me the next morning and ask me to work out how much he had won. 'That lasted about two months then he realised he had to slow down. 'He started getting addicted to it and he said he had to stop as he was a working person and a family man. A lot of the times he would come in his wife would come together with him.' Deborah . Blum, a poison expert whose book 'The Poisoner's Handbook' is being . made into a PBS TV series, said that Mr Khan would have been in . 'absolute agony' and likely coughed up blood as he was killed. A . former chemist, Miss Blum said: 'A good lethal dose of cyanide will . kill you in 10 minutes. A mid range dose and people die within the hour. For a poison that's pretty fast. 'Cyanide . poisoning is a nasty death. There is an enzyme which allows your cells . to breathe and the cyanide wipes that enzyme out. It suffocates you cell by cell. Symptoms include seizures, extreme shortness of breath and usually cardiac arrest. 'There . is something known as a 'cyanide scream' where your muscles are . contracting, so this could be what Mr Khan’s relatives heard.' Miss Blum added that cyanide would have had a bitter taste and that the best way to disguise it would be to put it into spicy food. A mere 200mg would be enough to take somebody's life, and that could be obtained from pesticides or certain kinds of rat poison. Historically, money is a 'good reason' why people poison, Miss Blum explained. She said: 'In the 19th century they used to call cyanide 'inheritance powder' because so many people used it to get their inheritance early. 'People also poison to punish, such as getting revenge on their boss, or to end a relationship that they want out of. 'Poisoners are unique killers because they are never impulsive. Poisoners are planners. 'There's always an element of calculation, and they think they will get away with it - just as nearly happened in this case.' Ms Ansari earlier told The Chicago Tribune: 'By God's grace, he was a workaholic. Day or night ... he picks up the phone 24/7. He made the clients happy by doing his job. He could not be everywhere, but he had to be everywhere.' Chicago Police Department spokeswoman Melissa Stratton confirmed the department was now investigating the death. No arrests have so far been made.","Shabana Ansari says Urooj Khan's July 20 death devastated her and that talking about how he died was too painful .

So common, in fact, that there is a euphemism coined for the public sexual molestation of women. In reference to the biblical 'Eve', 'Eve teasing' implies that women are responsible for the behaviour of their attackers. Rape victims rarely press charges because of social stigma and fear they will be accused of inviting the attack. Many women say they structure their lives around protecting themselves and their daughters from attack. New Delhi is the rape capital of India with a rape reported on average every 18 hours.

Spared jail: Nigel Parsons, who admitted filming three female colleagues in the shower at Bestinvest investment advisors, is pictured outside Southwark Crown Court . An investment director who hid a phone in work showers to make secret films of female colleagues has been spared jail. Nigel Parsons, 34, was handed a three-year supervision order and sent on a sex offenders course because a judge ruled that he would not get the help he needs in prison. Parsons had admitted two counts of voyeurism after rigging up an iPhone in a bathroom at top investment advisors Bestinvest to capture female coworkers as they undressed. Southwark Crown Court heard that his sordid plot was uncovered when a member of staff spotted the phone and found recordings of herself and two other members of staff naked in the shower. Sentencing Parsons, judge Anthony Leonard said: 'The use of a hidden camera to film work colleagues showering or changing is a despicable offence, amounting to an invasion of their privacy. 'I have no doubt that the offences are serious enough to merit a custodial sentence, but I am not able to pass one of the length that would ensure you receive the counselling and therapy I judge you would need.' Instead, Parsons was handed a supervision order, told to complete a 120-hour sex offenders course and will also be under nightly curfew for the next five months. Parsons was identified because he had filmed himself setting up and adjusting the device. Two recordings were made between February 17 and 21 of this year at the Bestinvest headquarters in  Mayfair, central London. Prosecutor Peter Zinner said: 'Three young women were filmed over the course of two days. Hearing: Nigel Parsons was spared jail at Southwark Crown Court, pictured, as judges didn't feel he would recieve the help he needs in prison . 'They were not only shocked they were being filmed but distressed that this was done to them by a senior colleague who they worked with and trusted and liked.' Parsons pleaded guilty to two counts of voyeurism at an earlier hearing at Southwark Crown Court. He also admitted making or possessing 61 indecent images of children, all aged under-10 and distributing one image. These included images of sadism against children, as well as extreme sexual abuse. Judge Leonard said: 'The images show depravity on your part, and also show a lack of human understanding for the suffering endured by these children, caused by your demand for the photos.' Voyeur: Nigel Parsons planted the iPhone in the bathroom of Bestinvest's headquarters in Mayfair, London . John Armstrong, defending, said Parsons had lost his job and been unable to find more work within the financial industry. He was also thrown out by his wife and is now only allowed supervised contact with his daughter at weekends. He claims to have given up looking at child porn after her birth in February 2011. According to Bestinvest's website the firm has won several awards including UK Wealth Manager of the Year 2011 and Self-Select ISA Provider of the Year 2011. It also states: 'The company is one of the fastest-growing private client advisory firms and is proud to support the NSPCC.' Parsons, of High Wycombe, Bucks, pleaded guilty to two counts of voyeurism, ten counts of making indecent images, one count of distributing an indecent image, and one count of possessing indecent images. A Bestinvest spokesman said: 'Bestinvest confirms that Nigel Parsons was a portfolio manager in our investment management team until February 2012. 'He resigned his employment following a serious allegation of gross personal misconduct towards certain Bestinvest staff which was unrelated to any work undertaken for our clients. 'The matter was also reported to the police. His actions towards our staff were wholly unacceptable as were those that separately emerged during the subsequent police investigation and search of his home.'","Nigel Parsons was sentenced to a three-year supervision order .

But they do if you're Alexander Demetriou and your job is playing the baddie in the touring production of Disney On Ice. 'It's brilliant fun being Captain Hook,' the ice skater told MailOnline. 'As a villain you can get away with a lot more than playing a good guy. And if I see a kid crying then i know I'm doing my job! But when I'm dressed up in my costume children seem to cry just looking at me!' SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Alexander says performing in his Hook costume while dancing on ice is made difficult because of the outfit's weight . Alex, who  who grew up in Blackpool and has been skating since he was seven years old, plays the pirate in the Peter Pan section of Disney On Ice's touring production, Passport To Adventure. 'I loved Peter Pan when I was a child, so it's terrific performing in it now. It's wonderful to hear all the little kids doing the ""tic-tocs"" with the crocodile's clock, and seeing their smiling faces light up when all the characters come onto the ice. Of course, they're not meant to smile when they see me!' Alex explained that the trickiest part of his job is switching between the roles of different Disney characters, changing skating styles to portray different characters. 'As well as performing Captain Hook, I also play David in Lilo & Stitch. He's a bit of a surfer dude so I whizz around the rink more, whereas Hook's skating style is a lot sharper and rougher. 'Plus, Hook's costume itself is very demanding because it's so heavy - the heaviest one on the tour - which means that I actually can't physically jump or spin while I'm wearing it. 'It makes sword-fighting on ice pretty tricky - especially since we use real swords so they're also really heavy.' Mickey and Minnie Mouse performing in Disney on Ice . Happily, Alex has never skated off the ice with more than the odd finger injury. A cut here, a graze there. Though there was once a slippery situation with a crocodile... 'I've had a few falls - in a live show anything can happen - my best one was once when I was being chased by the crocodile and I'm meant to jump into the audience onto a stairwell - but I tripped and fell face-first into them. Luckily I didn't fall on any small children.' And being familiar with grueling training sessions, Alex also had a few words of advice for the contestants on the new series of Dancing On Ice. 'Don't get worried about the audience - try to forget there are people watching . otherwise you'll have falls. 'I always get pre-match nerves. Not as bad . as when I first started, but there's always a little fear in your minds. And I . don't have any superstitions at all - I think it's best not to, otherwise . you'll panic.' (Sadly, his wisdom comes a little too late for Pammy, who exited the show after just one episode following a fall and a slippery wardrobe malfunction.) 'I'd love to do Dancing On Ice,' Alex . added.

Not consulted: Fiona Bruce said she was told 'almost casually' by a nurse that life-saving treatment had been removed from her 83-year-old father . An MP told movingly yesterday how she saved her father from the Liverpool Care Pathway, two years after her mother endured an ‘agonising’ death on the system. Fiona Bruce said she was told ‘almost casually’ by a nurse that doctors had decided to remove life-saving treatment from her 83-year-old father, despite not having consulted relatives. She moved him into a nursing home where, six months on, he is thriving. Her mother died after she was placed on the controversial system following a brain tumour operation. Mrs Bruce spoke out during a Parliamentary debate on the pathway, in which MP after MP criticised the way it is being implemented in hospitals. In a separate development, senior doctors conceded the LCP has become a ‘euphemism for death’, with families ‘frightened’ about their relatives going on it. Dr Bee Wee, president of the Association for Palliative Medicine, said the checklist for LCP patients was sometimes used unthinkingly by staff. ‘We know that training deficiencies exist,’ she said. ‘If people are getting bad care, we need to get to the bottom of it.’ In the Commons debate, one MP claimed patients were being killed with ‘machine-like efficiency’ with fewer than 5 per cent of patients placed on the LCP ever taken off it. Another said failure to inform a family that a patient was being put on the scheme was tantamount to ‘murder’ and that doctors who did so should ‘face the legal consequences’. Care Services Minister Norman Lamb, . who following a Daily Mail campaign ordered an independent inquiry into . the pathway which will report by the summer, said he had been . ‘personally horrified’ by accounts of food and drink being . inappropriately withdrawn. Concern: Care Services Minister Norman Lamb ordered an independent inquiry into the pathway which will report by the summer. He said he had been 'personally horrified' by accounts of food and drink being inappropriately withdrawn . It was ‘non-negotiable’ that relatives should always be consulted, he said. Every year, 130,000 people die on the pathway, under which doctors remove life-saving treatment. In December it emerged that almost half are never told that treatment is being removed. Mrs Bruce, vice chairman of the parliamentary Dying Well group, said that in her mother’s case ‘it took her weeks to pass away, which was agonising for her, and heart-rending for her family. There was no discussion, no consultation with the daughter.’ Last summer, her father was taken to hospital feeling unwell, she told MPs. Doctors could not diagnose any illness, although he was very frail. After a few days, Mrs Bruce asked a nurse how he was doing. The MP for Congleton recalled: ‘“Oh,” said the nurse, almost casually, “he’s not very well at all. He has not long to live; we’re putting him on the Liverpool Care Pathway.” No discussion, no explanation, no consultation; just an announcement. Surely there should be more formality about this, more dignity.’ A day later, he was moved to a nursing home. ‘There, his needs were attended to in a positive and caring way,’ Mrs Bruce said. ‘There he didn’t die. In fact, he got better. Now, well over six months later, that elderly man is very much alive, still being cared for: eating well, enjoying visits from his family. It’s not a fantastic quality of life – but it is a life.’","Fiona Bruce said treatment was withdrawn from father without consultation .

An NHS hospital has been found guilty of making bogus claims about the benefits of hypnosis for serious medical conditions. The Royal London Hospital for Integrated Medicine has been told to withdraw a leaflet it issued promoting hypnosis treatment for a number of conditions including mental health problems and irritable bowel syndrome. The hospital, whose patron is the Queen, is part of the group of University College London Hospitals NHS trust and calls itself the largest public sector provider of integrated medicine in Europe. The Royal London Hospital for Integrated Medicine has been told to withdraw a leaflet promoting hypnosis treatment for serious conditions . Apart from hypnosis, its clinicians offer various alternative medical therapies including homeopathy and acupuncture. A leaflet issued by the London hospital headed ‘Medical and Clinical Hypnosis’  made a number of impressive claims for the treatment. It boasted: ‘Hypnosis can benefit almost anyone to improve their physical, emotional and mental health.’ It then went on to provide a long list of conditions which it could help alleviate including problems with the immune, nervous and gastro-intestinal systems. The leaflet said hypnosis could also help sufferers with conditions such as irritable bowel syndrome and dyspepsia. The benefits of hypnosis were questioned by a campaigning group called the Nightingale Collaboration which was set up to challenge claims made for quack treatments. It made a formal complaint to the Advertising Standards Authority(ASA), which ruled that most of the hospital’s claims for hypnotherapy could not be substantiated. The leaflet said hypnosis could help sufferers with conditions such as irritable bowel syndrome and dyspepsia . The hospital provided a raft of clinical studies and research papers to back up their claims, however these failed to satisfy the advertising watchdog. Its decision calls into question the use of hypnosis in the NHS, where millions of pounds of public money is spent offering the controversial therapy. The ASA said there is evidence that hypnotherapy can help relieve anxiety, confidence issues and minor skin conditions, but it said the hospital was wrong to make wider claims about improving mental and physical health. It said most of the trials and studies presented by the hospital to justify its claims were too small to provide meaningful conclusions. ‘We concluded that the claim ‘Hypnosis can benefit almost anyone to improve their physical, emotional and mental health’ exaggerated the potential benefit to patients’ mental and physical health and was therefore misleading,’ it said. The hospital was told to withdraw the leaflet by the ASA, which said most of the hospital's claims could not be substantiated . Similarly, the hospital was unable to provide convincing evidence of benefits for the immune, nervous or gastro-intestinal systems. The ASA did side with the hospital over claims that hypnosis can help people cope with the effects of chronic pain, such as headaches, cancer pain and rheumatism. However, it banned the hospital from issuing the leaflet again and told executives to make sure that they have ‘robust evidence’ to substantiate medical claims in any future publications. It said: ‘In summary, we considered that the body of evidence provided by RLHIM, as a whole, had supported the notion that hypnotherapy might help people to cope with and manage pain, and with perceived relief of pain. ‘However, we considered that the leaflet had misleadingly implied more: that hypnotherapy could treat or cure the conditions listed, an interpretation for which we had not seen suitably robust evidence.’ The hospital said it took the ASA ruling ‘very seriously’. It added: ‘We will make the necessary changes to bring our patient information in line with their guidance. In the meantime we have withdrawn the leaflet concerned and have amended our website accordingly.’ Two unrelated adverts which referred to Jimmy Savile have been ruled harmful and offensive following complaints that they made light of allegations of sexual abuse against the disgraced TV presenter. An email for clothing company DirtySmart read 'Choose your fate' with arrows pointing to a cartoon image of Savile. One person complained that the ad was offensive and irresponsible because it made light of the allegations under investigation. Another email for Extreme Publishing read 'How's about that then' in large print above a black and white image of Savile wearing underwear and smoking a cigar with a superimposed copy of a magazine in his hand. Two complainants challenged whether the ad was offensive and irresponsible in view of recent media coverage surrounding the abuse allegations. DirtySmart acknowledged that some people may have found the cartoon image of Savile distasteful but they considered it would not cause serious or widespread offence. Extreme Publishing, trading as TBM Magazine, said it did not intend to offend or upset anyone by sending the email. The (ASA) said the adverts were likely to cause serious offence to some. It said:  'We told them to ensure they prepared their ads with a sense of responsibility to consumers and to society, and to ensure they did not cause serious or widespread offence.' A campaign for Rowse honey has been banned for making a 'misleading' claim that it is a natural source of slow release energy. The television advert, which screened in April last year, featured a boy squeezing honey on to his porridge before heading off to school where he was shown playing football and participating in lessons, while a voiceover said: 'Rowse honey is a natural source of slow release energy for busy boys and girls.' Nine viewers complained that the slow release energy claim was misleading. Defending the ad, Rowse said it believed the term 'slow release energy' implied the energy was delivered more slowly than a comparable food or ingredient. It believed Rowse honey qualified for the claim because it was a significant source of fructose, pointing out that the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) had said that 'fructose is more slowly absorbed in the gastro-intestinal tract than glucose'. However the ASA said it understood from its own expert foods were deemed to have a low GI when the value was 55 or below, noting that the Rowse test gave a value of between 50 and 60. It said: 'Because the ad did not make clear that the consumption of Rowse honey led to a lower blood glucose rise than the consumption of sucrose or glucose-containing foods, we concluded that the claim was misleading and therefore breached the Code.' It ruled: 'The ad must not be broadcast again in its current form.'","Royal London Hospital for Integrated Medicine told to withdraw leaflet .

Ms Arnold, who left her position as BBC Radio 4 newsreader two weeks ago, said sexism is still a problem at the corporation. She told the London Evening Standard: 'You look at men of a certain age or appearance who are on TV and think: ""If you were a woman, you wouldn't be there."" 'It's a constant struggle in a culture that prizes looks and youth so highly, but the BBC needs to stand up and say ""No"". 'Clare is a very good example of breaking that mould.' On Saturday, Balding hosted Britain's Brightest Brain in the prime time slot. Her appointment is a significant break in personnel from the likes of Tess Daley, who presents Strictly Come Dancing with Sir Bruce Forsyth. The new series comes after Balding's presenting during London 2012 was widely celebrated for her enthusiastic but clear and informative style. Ms Arnold, 50, said her partner has got where she is through 'talent'. She told the newspaper: 'If you're in a position where people will look at you and listen to you then you have to grasp that opportunity. We both feel very strongly about it.' Ms Arnold's comments may reignite the row over ageism and sexism at the BBC. Former Countryfile presenter Miriam .

A Barclays manager has been jailed for stealing thousands of pounds from an elderly millionaire's account in the hope the customer would not notice the money was missing. Shaikh Khan, who handled hundreds of Premier accounts for a London branch's wealthiest customers, stole £10,000 from Jack Mautner - described as 'particularly old and vulnerable' - who had over £1million in his Barclays account. After taking the money, the 26-year-old manager tampered with Mr Mautner's account details to ensure he was not sent a statement and alerted to the missing cash. Deceit: Barclays manager Shaikh Khan handled hundreds of Premier accounts for wealthy customers . Khan, who worked in a Barclays branch on Oxford Street, also stole a further £10,000 from another customer, Lilia Vasilieva, who did not regularly check her account. The Old Bailey heard the scam was masterminded by Khan's friend Farah Mahmood, 26, and that the majority of the stolen cash was channeled through accounts belonging to Ali Bashir, another schoolfriend, also 26. Khan, who had previous convictions for dishonesty, first accessed Ms Vasilieva's account using a colleague's ID on January 13 2011, and transferred £5,000 to Bashir's account. He recorded the transfer as a 'face to face' transaction. He transferred another £5,000 on January 26. Khan changed the address on the account so Ms Vasilieva did not receive her statements, the court heard. Prosecutor Tim Devlin told the court Khan and a colleague visited Mr Mautner's home on January 26 to discuss a legitimate transfer of £50,000. 'Perhaps realising that Mr Mautner was very old, he decided to target a particularly old and vulnerable member of society,' he said. 'He must have seen how much was in that account and decided to have some of it for himself and his friends.' The court heard Khan had lied on his CV in order to get his Barclays job. Web of fraud: The scam was masterminded by Farah Mahmood, left, while the stolen cash was channeled through accounts belonging to Ali Bashir, right, the court heard . A judge at the Old Bailey described the three friends' 'web of fraud' as an offence which 'strikes at the heart of the banking system and one in which wealthy, elderly and vulnerable customers were preyed upon'. Khan, of Manor Park, east London, Mahmood, of East Ham, and Bashir, of Ealing, west London, had all denied conspiracy to steal between January 10, 2011, and February 25 2011, but were convicted by a jury. Khan had claimed he was acting under duress after being threatened by Mahmood. Judge Kramer said: 'This was a deliberately dishonest and targeted fraud. 'You, Mahmood, were at the centre of a web of fraud, arranging it and giving instructions to the others as to where the money should go. 'I am satisfied that you, Khan, abused your managerial position at that bank. You selected two accounts and withdrew £20,000.' The judge said Khan knew one account was 'rarely checked', and that the other contained a seven figure sum meaning the missing money would be 'a drop in the ocean'. Bashir's rolr was to act as a 'conduit' through whose account £15,000 of the stolen money was channeled, the judge added. Khan and Mahmood were each jailed for 18 months. Bashir was given a 12 month prison sentence suspended for two years.","Barclays manager Shaikh Khan, 26, stole £20,000 from wealthy customers .

Kennedy, who was acquitted of criminal charges in a maternity ward scuffle, is suing two nurses who publicly said that he kicked them in the crotch during the assault. Douglas Kennedy is alleging defamation and malicious prosecution by nurses Cari Luciano and Anna Lane. He said their statements to police and on NBC's Today show held him up to 'ridicule and scorn' and led to his prosecution. The lawsuit, filed on Friday in White Plains, New York stems from Kennedy's attempt a year ago to take his newborn son from Northern Westchester Hospital in Mount Kisco. He said he wanted the two-day-old boy, Anthony Boru Kennedy, to get some fresh air. Hospital: Mr Kennedy is shown in security footage trying to take his newborn son for a walk . Confrontation: Kennedy, in the blue jacket, can be seen going for the elevator in the scuffle with one of the nurses . The nurses objected, however, and tried to block his way, then claimed he hurt them. Luciano said Kennedy kicked her; Lane said he twisted her arm. They testified at his trial, which ended with his acquittal in November on charges of child endangerment and physical harassment. The judge said that the baby was not in danger - except from the nurses' actions - and that Kennedy didn't demonstrate any intent to hurt them. In addition to the defamation and malicious prosecution charges, Kennedy accuses Luciano of assaulting him. Family: Douglas Kennedy, pictured with his wife Molly and his son Daniel Boru, is the 10th of Robert Kennedy's 11 children . Sued: Anna Margaret Lane, left, and Cari Maleman Luciano, right, are being sued by Douglas Kennedy after the scuffle last year at Northern Westchester Hospital in Mount Kisco, New York . His wife, Molly, accuses the nurses and the hospital of inflicting emotional distress. She also blames the hospital for a breach of the privacy of her medical records. And both Kennedys accuse the hospital of custodial interference. Kennedy's lawyer, Gary Douglas, said on Tuesday: 'The spirit and intent of this suit is, in part, to discourage further invasions of privacy and defamatory personal attacks.' Next battle: Douglas Kennedy, seen here with his wife at an April court appearance, had the criminal charges dropped but now faces a $200,000 lawsuit from the nurses involved . The nurses sued Kennedy soon after the acquittal, seeking $200,000 and accusing him of negligence, assault and battery, and causing them emotional and physical distress. Kennedy's lawsuit does not specify damages. Elliot Taub, the nurses' lawyer, said the Kennedy suit is 'a sham, baseless, and nothing other than his attempt at retaliation. It's his attempt to blame the victims'. Calls to the hospital weren't immediately returned. Violence: One of the nurses is seen on the ground after she was allegedly kicked by Kennedy at the hospital elevator .

A controversial Swedish artist is under investigation in Poland amid claims he created a painting using ashes taken from a Nazi concentration camp. Carl Michael von Hausswolff sparked outrage last month when he claimed that he had stolen ashes from the Majdanek camp in eastern Poland in 1989 and more than two decades later mixed them with water to use as paint. The resultant painting was displayed at a gallery in the Swedish city of Lund. Outrage: Carl Michael von Hausswolff has painted a picture using ashes which he claims to have taken from the crematorium of a Nazi concentration camp in Poland . Following media reports of the furore . surrounding the artwork, the Polish Prosecutor's Office yesterday . confirmed that Mr von Hausswolff's claims are now being investigated, . according to the Times of Israel. A spokesman added that there is currently no evidence and that Swedish investigators will be asked to provide help. If investigators do find truth in his claims, then Mr von Hausswolff could be charged with . desecrating human ash or a resting place. Mr von Hausswolff said last year that . he had visited the Polish town of Lublin, close to the Majdanek . concentration camp, in 1989 to exhibit some of his work in a gallery . there. He said he was 'gathering material for the exhibition' when he visited the camp. He added: ‘I gathered some ashes from one of the . cremation ovens, but did not use it for the exhibition – the material . was too charged with the cruelties which had taken place. But in 2010 he did use the ashes and his painting caused outcry among art critics. Morbid art: Mr von Hausswolff took the ashes of victims from the Majdanek concentration camp near Lublin in Poland . Author and translator Salomon Schulman called the artwork ‘nauseating, obsessed necrophilia’. With what he calls ‘posthumous . disgust’, Mr Schulman asked last month: ‘Some of the ashes may be from one of my . relatives? Maybe even a brother of my flesh?’ ‘It is repulsive beyond the extreme’, he told Swedish television. Swedish police had received a complaint from a member of the public who said the . painting breaks the Swedish law protecting buried human remains. ‘It is a strange complaint which we will investigate,’ detective Stephan Söderholm said at the time. The work was displayed at the Martin . Bryder Gallery in the southern Swedish city of Lund as part of an . exhibition called 'Memory Works'. The exhibition also featured a picture of the ruins of Nazi military officer Hermann Goring's hunting cabin at the camp. The gallery owner, martin Bryder, had . defended the decision to put the work on display, saying that the . intention was not to cause upset. But he later cancelled the exhibition . amid protests from the Simon Wiesenthal Center, which described the . painting as an 'abomination' and the Jewish community of Malmo. Built on the outskirts of the Polish city of Lublin, Majdanek concentration camp was not originally intended for use as an extermination camp but the Nazi's but instead as one of forced labour. It was only at the onset of Operation Reinhard that its function changed and more than 79,000 people, including 59,000 Polish Jews, died at the camp during the 34 months of the operation. The site was captured nearly intact in July 1944 and remains the best preserved concentration camp of the Holocaust. People take part in ceremonies marking the 60th anniversary of the liberation of the Nazi Death Camp in front of the Majdanek memorial, in Majdanek southeastern Poland in 2004 . It was nicknamed Majdanek, or Little Majdan, by locals because of its unusual proximity to the city of Lublin. Unlike many other concentration camps, which were situated in rural areas, Majdanek could actually be seen from the city and neighboured the Majdan Tatarski area. Although the Nazis knew the camp initially as the Prisoner of War Camp of the Waffen-SS in Lublin, and later as Knzentrationslager Lublin (or Concentration Camp Lublin), it became remembered by its local name. Construction work initially began in October 1941, but continued throughout its existence. The site is now around half the size it was when captured and is currently a museum.","Swedish artist 'used ashes from Majdanek concentration camp for painting'

They believe the bizarre arrangement may have been caused by a meteorite or comet breaking up - or three separate impacts occuring in a unique coincidence. The 'three amigos' spotted on the surface of the moon, with debris sprayed upto 1km away . 'These three craters, located at 9.665°S, 7.646°E, appear to have formed more or less at the same time, certainly within a few minutes of each other,' the researchers say. 'The southwest crater is 180 m diameter; the center crater is 150 m; and the northeast crater is 125m across. 'From the northeast crater center to the southwest crater centers, they cover about 450 m.'

He added to Bloomberg his three clients will plead not guilty to all charges when they make their next court appearance. The news comes after the father of the murdered woman has described her desperate battle for life - and his futile hope that she would live. Badri Singh said that although he knew that his daughter was 'in a bad state' after she was attacked by six men in Delhi last month, he still believed she might recover after she was taken to hospital in Singapore. But the 23-year-old physiotherapy student was to die after sustaining horrific injuries during the assault. Speaking to ITV1's Daybreak, Mr Singh said: 'When we went to Singapore she was not conscious but she had tears in her eyes. Then I realised she was in a really bad state.

'brought an awakening' to Indian society and called for his country to . no longer turn a blind eye to attacks on women.

Meanwhile, . the victim's companion on the night of the attack, 28-year-old software . engineer Awindra Pandey, has spoken out about the terrible ordeal and his friend's horrific injuries. He . told The Times that his efforts to flag down help from passing . motorists after the pair had been dumped in the road were ignored for 20 . minutes. Mr Pandey said that police were reluctant to help his friend despite her injuries. 'She was asking for water and complaining of pain in her stomach,' he said. 'She was bleeding heavily. They (the police) asked me to put her in the van.' He said that the pair, who were not dating, had been to a cinema in the city to see Life of Pi but were unable to persuade a rickshaw driver to take them all the way back to the Dwarka suburb where the woman lived with her parents. They were dropped halfway home, when a phone call from her mother asking her to hurry home prompted them to board an illegal bus with blacked out windows. Mr Pandey confronted other passengers when they began insulting the pair but they soon produced iron rods, he said. He said that he was beaten and fell to the floor of the bus. After up to 20 minutes, the gang believed the student to have died and dumped the pair in the road.","Manohar Lal Sharma said woman's male friend was 'wholly responsible'

British pensioners who live abroad could be the first to lose their winter fuel allowance under government plans to save millions of pounds from the welfare bill. Officials have been ordered to find a way to claw back up to £16million paid to people living outside the UK to help with their fuel bills. It comes as senior minister Ken Clarke signalled that the Tory pledge to protect universal benefits is likely to be ditched in the next election manifesto. Ministers want to stop expat pensioners living in hot parts of Europe like the Costa del Sol from claiming help with winter fuel bills . Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith yesterday suggested future generations of pensioners could lose some of their universal benefits like winter fuel allowance, free TV licences and bus passes. He has vowed to honour David Cameron’s pre-election pledge to protect the benefits until 2015, because pensioners are less able to increase their income than someone in work if benefits are suddenly cut. But he suggested that beyond 2015 new pensioners might not enjoy the same perks. Mr Duncan Smith is understood to be furious at a European Court of Justice ruling that will hugely increase the bill for Britons who live abroad claiming winter fuel allowance. Under current rules it can only be claimed by someone who moves overseas after turning 60. But the ruling said that anyone could claim it regardless of when they left the UK. Latest figures show that in 2011-12, £16million was paid to in winter fuel allowance to people not living in the UK. Today it emerged that officials are considering setting a qualifying threshold based on an average winter temperature, so that people living in Britain would qualify even if there was a mild spell. ‘Clearly it is a crazy idea that pensioners living in hot places abroad in Europe should be receiving winter fuel payments,’ a source said. ‘We are looking into seeing if there is something we can do around setting an average temperature in order to get round the European Court of Justice ruling. It is important that taxpayers’ money is used to help pensioners here. ‘An average temperature rule would ensure people here get it regardless.’ Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith (left) wants to stop people who live outside Britain from claiming the winter fuel allowance as minister Ken Clarke warns cutting all pensioner benefits will be an 'agenda item' in discussions on the next Tory manifesto . The winter fuel allowance is worth £200 for single pensioners, rising to £300 for the over 80s. Around 12million people receive it each year. But critics have said it should be limited to poorer people who need extra help with their fuel bills. Last week former Lib Dem minister Paul Burstow suggested just the 2million poorest should be eligible, saving around £1.5billion. Senior ministers are pushing Mr Cameron to ditch his pledge to protect the allowance. Mr Clarke today suggested the Tory leader had been rushed into promising not to cut them, and it would be an ‘agenda’ item for the next Conservative manifesto. Mr Clarke said: ‘Before the election the Labour party started putting out leaflets accusing us of planning to take away benefits from pensioners. ‘Very rapidly a promise was given that we wouldn’t reduce benefits to pensioners,’ he told BBC Radio 4. ""We actually tied ourselves down for this parliament not addressing them. They, I’m sure, when we get round, which we haven’t yet, contemplating our manifesto for the next election they’ll be an agenda item.’","European Court Ruling will increase the number of Brits abroad who can claim winter fuel allowance .

Anchorage couple Chris and Susie Linford were surprised after their debit card details were stolen and the thief went on a $5,000 shopping spree at their expense. Their credit union quickly intercepted the fraud, however, and the Linfords were not left out of pocket. So the real shock came when a series of weird and wonderful items were delivered to their home - clearly Christmas gifts ordered to the wrong address by the criminal who had cloned their cards. Chris and Susie Linford suddenly started receiving a weird selection of parcels at their home. The fraudster had mistakenly sent them his shopping, including an Atlanta Braves baseball bat and a $900 Dale Earnhardt Jr. signed print . Mrs Linford told the Anchorage Daily News that she was working from home one day in mid-December when the parcels began to arrive. The first package contained a JVC stereo and a radar detector. Then, as Susie explained, 'the boxes started coming pretty quick, a couple of deliveries a day.' Next to arrive was a baseball bat signed by former Atlanta Braves third baseman Chipper Jones, then an autographed and framed portrait of stock car racer Dale Earnhardt Jr. The next orders were more practical - four North Face jackets and martial arts equipment such as gloves and shin pads. The first item to gifted by the thief was a JVC stereo . Mrs Linford told the Anchorage Daily News that, from this selection, she believed the generous thief was a 20- to 30-year-old male. But the next arrival was a $50 linen scrapbook, followed by an expensive women's coat. The criminal was clearly doing his Christmas shopping . He was mistakenly sending his ill-gotten gains to the billing address rather than an alternative delivery address. Strangely, the Linfords then received a letter from a fruit of the month club, regretting the fact that they didn't deliver to Alaska. As the couple say that their debit cards were never out of their possession, the thief must have got hold of their details online. And Susie told ABC News that her favorite gift from the fraudulent shopper was, ironically, software protection software. The mysterious buyer also sent a radar detector for his car, but he didn't get any benefit out of this crime . The final package was a large corner shelf for plants. After the holidays, the Linfords began to track down where the presents had come from, and where they had to be sent back to. As it the transactions were seemingly made online rather than in person, the couple were not legally required to return the gifts. 'We were told you’re welcome to keep it, but I thought no that’s not right,' Mrs Linford told ABC. So she is now returning the items one-by-one. The couple tracked IP addresses for the orders to properties in Illinois and Kansas It seems that the thief had no plans to pick up the merchandise in Alaska the whole episode was a series of oversights. The absent-minded buyer has yet to be identified and it is unknown whether his family and friends received any Christmas presents this year.

A multi-millionaire lottery winner who was forced to close his music shop has decided to relaunch the business online. Adrian Bayford, who became one of Britain's biggest ever jackpot winners when he landed £148million in the Euromillions last year, had hoped to keep his instrument shop open despite his newfound wealth. But after closing the shop because of people constantly coming in and asking for money, he is set to convert part of his home into a workshop to support a new web-based business. Trying again: Adrian Bayford, pictured with his wife Gillian, is relaunching his music business online . Mr Bayford is turning stables in the grounds of his £6million mansion into a state-of-the-art space for making instruments which will allow him to fulfil his vow to keep working. The 41-year-old father of two closed his shop in Haverhill, Suffolk in December because he said there was a 'Lotto cloud' hanging over it making him a target for begging strangers. Along with his business partner and best friend Richard Hudspith, 38, Mr Bayford will launch the new online business in the spring. His new workshop will make electric guitars, mandolins and ukeleles. Closed: Mr Bayford was forced to shut his shop in Haverhill, Suffolk after being constantly asked for money . In business: Mr Bayford is relaunching the shop online with his best friend Richard Hudspith, left . 'From what I gather they had a lot of trouble with people coming into the store and asking for money,' said music teacher and customer Jonathan Coe. 'I think they didn't want their business to be so heavily associated with the Lotto win so they've closed up shop and are putting the store online. 'Adrian is currently converting old stables at their new property and making them into the workshops for Richard to continue his work with guitars. 'He'll be running the business from there and they are still very much in business together.' Mr Bayford, a former postman, promised to keep his business open after he and wife Gillian, 40, won the enormous jackpot in August. The down-to-earth pair celebrated by ordering a pizza from Domino's and taking an easyJet flight to Scotland. Payout: The Bayfords won £148million in August, one of the biggest lottery jackpots in the UK . Trading up: The couple have bought a £6million Georgian mansion, with a stable in its grounds which is set to be turned into a musical instrument workshop . Two weeks later Mr Bayford was back at work behind the counter of his shop, but last month 'Closing Down' signs appeared in the window. A neighbouring businessman said: 'Adrian was getting a lot of grief from people walking in and trying to get cash off him. 'There are idiots in every town and some of them got nasty when he turned them away. He just does not need that kind of abuse.' The Bayfords were unavailable for comment on their plans for the new business, and Mr Hudspith declined to give any details about the venture. 'Now we are enjoying some quiet time and don't want to say anything about the future,' he said. 'We have got a couple of things in the pipeline but do not wish to disclose exactly what they are at this time.' Mr Bayford - who is 516th in the Sunday Times Rich List - started selling secondhand CDs on a market stall before opening his shop. He and his wife splashed out on their 'Downton Abbey-style' mansion last November.","Adrian Bayford closed shop in Suffolk last month because he was sick of strangers asking him for money in wake of massive lottery win .

A third glitch for one of Boeing's new Dreamliner jets in as many days has heightened concerns about the safety of the aircraft. The 698 model, operated by Japan's All Nippon Airways (ANA), was due to fly to Tokyo's Haneda airport today but never left the ground. A spokesman at Yamaguchi Ube airport in western Japan said the domestic flight was cancelled because of a problem with the aircraft's brake system. Scrutiny: Concerns about the safety of the new Boeing Dreamliner aircraft have been raised after three faults in as many days . 'In the cockpit, an error message related to its brake system was displayed,' an ANA spokeswoman said. 'The exact nature and the cause of the error message is not clear yet,' she said. The 98 passengers were switched to another flight for Haneda. Yesterday, a fuel leak forced a 787 operated by Japan Airlines . to cancel takeoff at Boston's Logan International Airport. The day before, another 787 which had arrived caught fire after dropping off 183 passengers and crew from Tokyo at Boston. Step forward: The Dreamliner, made 50 per cent from composite materials, was hailed as Boeing's bright new hope (file picture) The Dreamliner, hailed by Boeing as a step forward in aviation travel, has been besieged by problems from the outset. It was delivered three years later than originally planned and cost a reported £32billion to develop. It is the first large-scale commercial aircraft made 50 per cent from 'composite materials' including plastics and carbon fibre and experts believe it could bring an end to the 'aluminium age'. But the series of mishaps has seen Boeing's share price fall significantly in the past few days. They fell nearly 2.7 per cent yesterday, following a 2 per cent drop on Monday - wiping around $2.8 . billion off its market value, or more than a dozen Dreamliners at their list . price of $207million.

'While . they delivered a large and unexpected number of 787s last year, it's . possible that they should have instead focused on identifying glitches . and flaws, rather than pushing ahead with volume production,' he said. But the company's Asian customers rallied behind the US manufacturer, saying the incidents were glitches that can happen on new planes and confirming they had no plans to scale back or cancel orders for the aircraf.Japan is by far the biggest customer for the Dreamliner to date, with JAL and All Nippon Airways (ANA) operating a total of 24 of the 49 new planes delivered to end-December. JAL spokesman Kazunori Kidosaki said the carrier, which operates seven Dreamliners, had no plans to change orders it has placed for another 38 aircraft. ANA, which has 17 Dreamliners flying its colors, said it was sticking with its orders for another 49 of the planes, spokesman Etsuya Uchiyama said. State-owned Air India, which on Monday took delivery of the sixth of the 27 Dreamliners it has ordered, said precautionary measures were already in place and its planes were flying smoothly.

A visitor to Wales was beaten so badly that he had to have part of his skull removed - and he believes he was the victim of an 'anti-English' attack. Paul Meehan, 27, has released horrific pictures which reveal how a huge five-inch section of his skull was removed following the assault which left him fighting for his life in hospital. Doctors had to perform extensive surgery to release the pressure on his swollen brain and then wrote 'no bone' on the tape around his head. Paul Meehan, pictured recovering in hospital after five inches of his skull had to be removed, claims the assault was prompted when his attackers heard his Birmingham accent . Electrician Paul, from London, was enjoying a night out on October 28 with his family in the Welsh capital Cardiff when he was attacked. He claims six thugs heard him speaking with an English accent and launched a brutal assault, punching and kicking him in the head before they left him lying in the street. He was taken to hospital where doctors treated him for concussion and whiplash, but three weeks later, after he had fell ill, he returned to hospital where tests revealed he had several skull fractures. They had to remove a five-inch lump of bone to try and stop an infection spreading to his brain. Paul, who is now only able to talk about his ordeal, said: 'They had to take a big section of skull away so I'm left with a squidgy bit on the side of my head. Paul Meehan (right) pictured before the attack on a night out in Cardiff, says the assault was unprovoked . Paul, who spent part of his childhood in Wales, was assaulted at a taxi . rank after a night out with his fiancee Laura Landeg and his relatives. He sustained a serious head injury, resulting in brain surgery . 'Whoever did this has ruined my life - I'm not going being to be able to go back to being my old self. 'The people who did this probably haven't thought about it since - they probably don't know how far it's gone.' Paul grew up in Cardiff and had a slight Welsh accent when he was younger. But he moved to Birmingham in his late teens where he picked up the region's accent which his attackers heard. Paul was assaulted at a taxi rank after a night out with his fiance Laura Landeg, 22, and relatives in the Welsh capital. He said: 'It was an unprovoked attack - they heard my accent, it was nothing more than that. 'I've always had a good time in Cardiff but I've been out before when this sort of thing has happened to other people. 'It could have turned into a murder case quite easily which is scary to think about.' Paul Meehan was initially treated for concussion and whiplash, but later tests revealed that he had several skull fractures . Paul suffered several skull fractures and bleeding in a vessel next to his brain. 'He also contracted an eye infection which spread throughout his blood stream. Paul will no have to wait six months before a metal plate is inserted in his head to replace the missing section of skull. Until then he is unable to work and is having regular neuro-rehabilitation treatment at a Birmingham hospital. South Wales Police are investigating the attack and have studied CCTV from Cardiff city centre in a bid to identify the gang. A spokesman said: 'Cardiff is a cosmopolitan multi-cultural city where people of different cultures and religions live side by side and have done for many, many years. 'The city has a successful and proud history of welcoming thousands of visitors from across the UK and the world to events such as the rugby Six Nations, the Olympics, and high-profile football games including the FA Cup while the new Wembley Stadium was built.

'This matter is being treated as a priority and officers will speak with the victim regarding his concerns expressed to the media that this was racially-motivated. 'While it happened sometime ago during the early hours of Sunday, October 28, it is hoped that witnesses may remember seeing the assault particularly as the offender used a belt as a weapon. 'We are appealing for witnesses or anyone who has any information to contact South Wales Police on 101 or Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.

Confirmation . that cookery’s most unlikely double act has reached its sell-by date . came yesterday in a Waitrose statement saying Miss Smith’s contract with . them finishes next month when they will be bidding her a ‘fond . farewell’. A spokesman . said: ‘Delia has other major projects and  commitments coming up in 2013 . and so, by mutual agreement, her contract will finish in February . 2013.’ Calls to Miss . Smith’s manager were yesterday responded to by Waitrose. Sources said . details of her new projects are likely to be revealed in the ‘next few . weeks’. Waitrose marketing . director Rupert Thomas said: ‘It has  been such a fantastic experience . working together and we have been really appreciative of the work Delia . has done with Waitrose.’ Both . Miss Smith and Mr Blumenthal signed three-year contracts with Waitrose . in March 2010 to take part in a campaign costing £10million. The . partnership was also a first for Waitrose, which had never before used . celebrity chefs to boost sales. In the campaign, the two personalities . encouraged customers to cook meals from scratch and created recipe . cards. They waived their fees for a low-budget Christmas advert so that the money could go to the retailer’s own community charities. Miss Smith’s departure was announced just days after  Waitrose revealed record festive sales. The Blumenthal-created Hidden Sauce Figgy Pudding and Christmas Cake were among the store’s top-sellers.

After the fatal cardiac arrest he was driven for his own funeral from Crake and Mallon Funeral Services in Stockton-on-Tees to Acklam crematorium in Middlesbrough.

A fourth man has been arrested by detectives investigating the murder of a church organist. Lay preacher Alan Greaves was making his way to Midnight Mass at St Saviour's Church, near his home in High Green, Sheffield, on Christmas Eve when he was attacked. A 22-year-old local man was arrested this afternoon in Parson Cross, Sheffield, on suspicion of Mr Greaves's murder, South Yorkshire Police said. The latest arrest follows that of a 21-year-old man from the High Green area of Sheffield last night. He remains in custody. Police said the arrest came after an excellent public response to an appeal on Monday, when they released CCTV footage of two men filmed just before Mr Greaves, a 68-year-old grandfather, was attacked as he went to the church a few hundred yards away from his home on December 24. Mr Greaves died from severe head injuries three days later. More than 50 police officers have been working on the case but detectives have been unable to establish a motive for the killing.

'The 22-year-old man from High Green/Fox Hill area of Sheffield was arrested this afternoon in Parson Cross, Sheffield.' Two other men, one in his 20s and one in his 40s, were arrested in connection with the murder last month and bailed pending further inquiries. Independent charity Crimestoppers has put up a £10,000 reward to help find those responsible for Mr Greaves's death. The reward will be available to anyone providing information to Crimestoppers leading to the arrest and conviction of any person or persons responsible for Mr Greaves's death.

According to a new study, some anti-cancer drugs can become more effective when combined with the pills. The mixture of drugs can kill aggressive tumours where other treatments have not been successful, it claims. Secret weapon? Scientists in the U.S. have claimed statins can boost the effectiveness of some anti-cancer drugs . Dr David Stern, of Yale University School of Medicine, examined potential drug combinations for treating resistant forms of the most dangerous form of skin cancer. The professor of pathology said using statins together with certain cancer drugs worked against some types of melanoma, according to the Daily Express. He claimed his findings could help to address the problem of cancer patients becoming resistant to treatments. 'Some patients who have a specific cancer-driving genetic mutation never respond to the matching drug, while nearly all those who initially respond eventually become resistant to the effects of the drug and their cancers relapse,' he said. Dr Stern believes the use of combinations of drugs could prove to be more effective. The study claims Slimvastatin, which is among the most commonly prescribed statins, was found to be effective when combined with the cancer drug flavopiridol. Cancer Research UK said that, while evidence to suggest statins combined with other drugs could be effective against melanoma was 'promising', it was an early study in cells and mice and more work would be needed to establish whether the approach would be beneficial in humans.

Died: Rebecca Tarbotton, 39, was swimming Wednesday at a beach about a half hour north of Puerto Vallarta when she was caught by a wave and tossed around. She died of asphyxiation . Environmentalist: Tarbotton was head of the Rainforest Action Network . 'The coroner ruled cause of death as asphyxiation from water she breathed in while swimming,' the Rainforest Action Network said in a statement issued Friday. RAN said Tarbotton — who friends called Becky — was travelling with her husband, Mateo Williford, and friends. Her husband works for Oakland, California, solar company Sungevity. He posted a photo of Tarbotton sitting by a pool overlooking the Ocean on his Facebook in memorial to her after she died. Dozens of people 'liked' the photo and posted their condolences on his wall. 'I grieve for your loss, Mateo, and the loss to the living world Becky defended,' wrote Jordan Fisher Smith. Patrick McCully wrote, 'I'm so, so terribly . sorry Mateo.

Rainforest Action Network works with major corporations on environmental projects, and Tarbotton recently brokered an agreement with the Walt Disney Company that changed the way the entertainment giant uses paper, RAN said.

Criminal charges linked to the so-called Plebgate affair could be brought by the end of the month, Britain’s most senior police officer said today. Metropolitan Police commissioner Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe said he hoped to hand a file on the Plebgate affair to prosecutors in a matter of weeks. Former chief whip Andrew Mitchell was forced to quit his . Cabinet post amid a storm of protest - fuelled by the Police Federation - . over claims he called officers 'plebs' during an altercation in Downing . Street. Metropolitan Police Commissioner Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe answers questions over the 'Plebgate affair' in front of the Home Affairs Select Committee in the House of Commons today . Met Police commissioner Bernard Hogan-Howe . (pictured right) hopes to hand files to prosecutors when the investigation into whether former chief whip Andrew Mitchell (left) was stitched up by police is completed . But new evidence has since emerged raising question marks over what happened and the Federation launched an internal review. Mr Hogan-Howe today said he will pass his findings to prosecutors when the force closes its . investigation into whether former chief whip Andrew Mitchell was actually the . target of a conspiracy involving officers. Appearing before the Home Affairs . Select Committee today, Sir Bernard criticised the Federation for getting involved with Mr Mitchell’s resignation. The Commissioner insisted he had an 'open mind' to the inquiry in the face of criticism that he had hastily backed the police officers involved. He admitted he made the comments before seeing the evidence that has since been made available - including CCTV footage of Mr Mitchell exiting the gate to the Prime Minister’s residence. Committee chairman Keith Vaz recounted . Sir Bernard’s assertion shortly after the allegations emerged that the . Met boss would 'stand by' his officers '100 per cent'. CCTV footage cast doubt on a police officer's account of the 'Plebgate' incident. The footage showed the officer ushering Mr Mitchell out of a side gate at Downing Street but showed no evidence of a row . Mr Vaz asked: 'Are you still saying you stand by the events or do you now have an open mind?' To which Sir Bernard replied: 'I do have an open mind. If any comment that I have made left anyone thinking I couldn’t have an open mind, I’m sorry.' He added: 'I’m open-minded. I will pursue the evidence.' Mr Mitchell has claimed he was the victim of a deliberate attempt to 'toxify' the Tories and ruin his career after it was alleged an email from a civilian witness backing up the police account of events was in fact written by another officer. Sir Bernard criticised public . statements made by Police Federation representatives in the wake of the . initial allegations against Mr Mitchell. Local Federation branches organised protests by members wearing 'PC Pleb' T-shirts and demanded Mr Mitchell’s sacking. MP Keith Vaz MP, chairman of the Home Affairs Select Committee, quizzed the police commissioner over his handling of the Plebgate incident . The Federation, which represents rank-and-file officers, has since said it planned an independent review into 'issues' with its operations. Sir Bernard told the Committee: 'My concern would be from some of the public statements from the Federation’s representatives is they got explicitly involved with asking for the resignation of a government member, and for me that is too much. 'That’s a decision for the Government to make or the Prime Minister to make - and not for police officers to get involved in.' Committee member Michael Ellis MP asked: 'Are you saying the conduct of the Police Federation was improper?' To which Sir Bernard replied: 'Those are your words, I’ll stick with mine. It’s not for the Police Federation or officers generally to call for the resignation of members of the Government.' Scotland Yard has decided to take statements from 800 police officers in the diplomatic protection group and 30 detectives are working on the investigation. Sir Bernard added that part of the investigation was to identify the source of the leaked police log, which recounted the altercation with Mr Mitchell. He told the Committee that if the allegations against the police officers involved were true, 'it would be a very serious matter'. 'I don’t expect police officers to lie,' he said. Clarifying the terms of the inquiry, Sir Bernard said it set out to 'investigate the circumstances surrounding the police officer’s claims to witnessing the incident on Downing Street'. He said the inquiry set out to 'establish if there’s any evidence of a conspiracy between the police and any other persons'. 'We expect we may be able to share a report with the CPS by the end of this month. A matter of weeks before we do as much as we can,' he added. He also revealed that a police officer arrested . on suspicion of misconduct in a public office will answer bail on . January 31, while a relative of the officer will answer bail on January . 16.

A total of 12,000 primary school pupils in Blackpool, Lancashire, will get the free start to the day amid fears they are arriving at classes starving. The pilot scheme will last three months and will cost taxpayers £700,000, with deprived local authority Blackpool Council backing it. Most important meal: Pupils at Devonshire Primary School can now enjoy a breakfast of fruit, toast, yoghurt and juice for free . The breakfasts include fruit, cereals and yoghurt and pupils must arrive 30 minutes before their first class to be fed. Children at Devonshire Primary School were among some of the first to make the most of the breakfast scheme. Shannon Wright, 9, from Layton, said: 'I thought it was a really tasty breakfast. It’s a nice to eat breakfast with my friends. 'We don’t always have time for breakfast at home so it will be good for my family.' However, a spokesman for local . government union UNISON said: 'We feel the money could be better spent . saving jobs at this council.' Free: The scheme is open to all pupils to remove the stigma that having free school meals sometimes bestows on children . But council leader Simon Blackburn says being properly fed will allow students to focus on their studies. He said: 'The launch of this scheme is the culmination of a great deal of hard work to ensure that the children of Blackpool get the best possible start to their day and are able to maximise their ability to succeed in school. 'There will be no discrimination between those families that can afford it and those that cannot, every pupil will be able to start their school day fed and ready to learn. 'It is really important that as many parents as possible take up this new service - it was save them cash every week that they can spend elsewhere in the local economy, and makes a huge collective effort to get our kids in school bright and early, and ready to learn.' He hopes the pilot scheme will eventually include secondary schools and universal free lunches. The council says the idea is supported by the National Association of Head Teachers (NAHT) and welcomed by the Children’s Society, whose research suggests the scheme is much needed. A Children's Society survey of teachers about hunger at school found that nearly half of those surveyed found that children are often hungry during the school day and two thirds of the teachers surveyed stated that staff provide pupils with food or money if they have not eaten. Help: Headteacher Neil Hodgkins, shown dining with pupils, said staff had reported some children were 'lethargic' through hunger . One teacher who took part said: 'Last . month [I] found two girls sat on [the] toilet floor sharing one’s packed . lunch because other [girl] had no lunch money.' Headteacher at Devonshire Primary School, Neil Hodgkins, applauded the scheme, saying: 'We see children in the morning who are lethargic and struggle to concentrate because they haven’t eaten properly. 'This scheme will help a lot to address those problems.'","Primary schools in Blackpool will offer morning meal to 12,000 children .

The SITA dustcart and its two crew members were left marooned at about 11.20am after driving through the gates to Downing Street and across the barrier which rises out from the ground to block unauthorised access. However, as the lorry was about halfway across someone or something caused the barrier to rise and wedge itself under the vehicle. Oops: A police officer helps the driver of a bin lorry trapped on the security barrier at Downing Street . Onlookers said it took about 20 minutes of back and forth between the driver and police at the gate before the barrier was eventually lowered and the truck was allowed in. One witness said: 'It was an embarrassing blunder. 'I felt sorry for the binmen who were just trying to do their job.' The incident, which completely blocked the entrance to Downing Street, happened after David Cameron had already left for Prime Minister's Questions at the House of Commons.

Trapped: The security barriers, designed to stop vehicles ramming the PM's residence, were released too early .

Clanger: Peter Mandelson's official Jaguar was another victim of the security barriers in 2010 . The 56-year-old had to remove her foot and rest it on the pavement while she fished her shoe out of the crack. Luckily, she emerged unscathed - and saw the funny side as she shared a laugh with photographers. Just weeks after the Coalition had made its first few faltering steps, Education Secretary Michael Gove took a tumble as he got out of his official car.

Extraordinary photographs of former FBI agent Robert Levinson who has been missing for almost six years reveal the hand of the Iranian government in his kidnapping U.S. intelligence officials have told The Associated Press. Posing in an orange jumpsuit like those worn by detainees at Guantanamo Bay the politically charged images of Levinson were sent directly by email to his family in 2011 - but investigators could find no trace of the source - indicating a high level of technological expertise. And despite the repeated denials of the Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad that the rogue state had anything to do with Levinson's disappearance in 2007, officials believe a professional intelligence service like Iran’s Ministry of Intelligence and Security was behind the messages. Scroll down for video . This undated handout photo provided by the family of Robert Levinson, shows retired-FBI agent Robert Levinson, 64, dressed as a Guantanamo Bay detainee . The photographs were released by the family to renew public interest in the case and come two years after a hostage video and photographs of retired FBI agent Robert Levinson raised the possibility that the missing American was being held by terrorists. Levinson, a private investigator, disappeared in 2007 on the Iranian island of Kish. The Iranian government has repeatedly denied knowing anything about his disappearance, and the disturbing video and photos that Levinson’s family received in late 2010 and early 2011 seemed to give credence to the idea. The extraordinary photos — showing Levinson’s hair wild and gray, his beard long and unkempt — are being seen for the first time publicly after the family provided copies to the AP. The video has been previously released. In response to Iran’s repeated denials, and amid secret conversations with Iran’s government, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said in a statement in March 2011 that Levinson was being held somewhere in South Asia. The implication was that Levinson might be in the hands of terrorist group or criminal organization somewhere in Pakistan or Afghanistan. Levinson, 64, went missing on the Iranian island of Kish in March 2007. Levinson's family received these photographs of him in April 2011 . The extraordinary photos ¿ showing Levinson¿s hair wild and gray, his beard long and unkempt ¿ are being seen for the first time publicly after the family provided copies to the AP . The statement was a goodwill gesture to Iran, one that the U.S. hoped would prod Tehran to help bring him home. But nothing happened. Two years later, with the investigation stalled, the consensus now among some U.S. officials involved in the case is that despite years of denials, Iran’s intelligence service was almost certainly behind the 54-second video and five photographs of Levinson that were emailed anonymously to his family. The level of expertise used to send those items was too good, indicating professional spies were behind them, the officials said, speaking on the condition of anonymity because they weren’t authorized to talk publicly. While everything dealing with Iran is murky, their conclusion is based on the U.S. government’s best intelligence analysis. The photos, for example, portray Levinson in an orange jumpsuit like those worn by detainees at the U.S. prison at Guantanamo Bay. The family received them via email in April 2011. In each photo, he held a sign bearing a different message. 'I am here in Guantanamo,' one said. 'Do you know where it is?' Another read: 'This is the result of 30 years serving for USA.' Retired FBI agent Robert Levinson (pictured far left) with his family in Coral Springs, Florida . Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad has personally and repeatedly criticized the U.S. over its detention facility at Guantanamo Bay. U.S. operatives in Afghanistan managed to trace the cellphone used to send the photographs, officials said. But the owner had nothing to do with the photos, and the trail went cold. It was that way, too, with the hostage video the family received. It was sent from a cyber cafe in Pakistan in November 2010. The video depicted a haggard Levinson, who said he was being held by a 'group.' In the background, Pashtun wedding music can be heard. The Pashtun people live primarily in Pakistan and Afghanistan, just across Iran’s eastern border. Yet the sender left no clues to his identity and never used that email address again.

Levinson retired from the FBI in 1998 and became a private investigator. He was investigating cigarette smuggling in early 2007, and his family has said that took him to the Iranian island of Kish, where he was last seen . Whoever was behind the photos and video was no amateur, U.S. authorities concluded. They made no mistakes, leading investigators to conclude it had to be a professional intelligence service like Iran’s Ministry of Intelligence and Security. Levinson’s wife, Christine, provided the photos to The Associated Press because she felt her husband’s disappearance was not getting the attention it deserves from the government. 'There isn’t any pressure on Iran to resolve this,' she said. 'It’s been much too long.' Though U.S. diplomats and the FBI have tried behind the scenes to find Levinson, of Coral Springs, Fla., and bring him home, both presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama have said little about his case and have applied little public pressure on Iran for more information about Levinson’s whereabouts. Christine Levinson has watched more public pressure result in Iran’s release of a trio of hikers, a journalist named Roxana Saberi and a team of British sailors captured by the Iranian Navy. Everyone has come home except her husband. Washington’s quiet diplomacy, meanwhile, has yielded scant results beyond the Iranian president’s promise to help find Levinson. Retired FBI agent Robert Levinson with three of his daughters in Coral Springs in Florida before his disappearance . 'We assumed there would be some kind of follow-up and we didn’t get any,' Christine Levinson said. 'After those pictures came, we received nothing.' In one meeting between the two countries, the Iranians told the U.S. that they were looking for Levinson and were conducting raids in Baluchistan, a mountainous region that includes parts of Pakistan, Iran and Afghanistan, U.S. officials said. But the U.S. ultimately concluded that the Iranians made up the story. There were no raids, and officials determined that the episode was a ruse by Iranian counterintelligence to learn how U.S. intelligence agencies work. An expert on Russian organized crime, Levinson retired from the FBI in 1998 and became a private investigator. He was investigating cigarette smuggling in early 2007, and his family has said that took him to the Iranian island of Kish, where he was last seen. Kish is a popular resort area and a hotbed of smuggling and organized crime. It is also a free trade zone, meaning U.S. citizens do not need visas to travel there. Robert Levinson with one of his grandchildren before his disappearance in 2007 on an Iranian resort island investigating cigarette smuggling . FBI spokeswoman Jacqueline Maguire said: 'As we near the sixth anniversary of his disappearance, the FBI remains committed to bringing Bob home safely to his family.' In an interview, Levinson’s wife said that because her husband disappeared in Iran, she believes her husband is still being held there. She doesn’t think the U.S. government has put enough pressure on Iran to release her husband. 'It needs to come front and center again,' Levinson said. 'There needs to be a lot more public outcry.' She said she has met with Obama and John Brennan, Obama’s counterterrorism czar and nominee to run the CIA. She said that both men pledged to do everything they could to free her husband. Now, nearly six years after his disappearance, she thinks Iran is being let off the hook. 'He’s a good man,' she said. 'He just doesn’t deserve this.' Meanwhile, Robert Levinson will miss another family milestone when his oldest daughter Susan gets married in February. 'He’s missed so many,' his wife said. 'It’s very upsetting.'","The photos portray .

A schizophrenic woman warned how she had already killed her own mother as she demanded to be admitted to hospital before she stabbed someone else, the Old Bailey heard today. Nicola Edgington, who knifed her mother to death eight years ago, then asked hospital staff whether it would take her killing someone else before she would be seen after a three and a half hour wait to see a specialist psychiatric team. She then walked out of the hospital and attacked a 24-year-old woman before allegedly killing 58-year-old Sally Hodkin with a butcher's knife in Bexleyheath, southeast London. Defendant: Diagnosed schizophrenic Nicola Edgington, 32, left, is accused of stabbing Sally Hodkin, 58, pictured right, to death with a 12-inch meat cleaver in Bexleyheath last year and the attempted murder of Kerry Clark, 22 . Danger to the public: Edgington turned up at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital at 4.30am in October last year demanding to be admitted before she hurt someone. After waiting three and a half hours to see psychiatric specialists, she then asked staff if she would have to kill someone else to be seen before walking out . Edgington, a diagnosed schizophrenic, had spent just three years in a secure hospital after admitting the manslaughter of her mother Marion, who she stabbed to death in November 2005. The following year she was given an indefinite hospital order and treated as an inpatient before being released in 2009. She was under the care of the nearby Bracton Centre and was being reviewed regularly by a psychiatrist and nurse while living at a housing association flat in Greenwich. The 32-year-old had previously been . diagnosed with schizophrenia but had stopped taking her medication at . the time of the two attacks on 10 October 2011. Attack: The Meat Market in Bexleyheath where Edgington is alleged to have taken the knife . Edgington turned up at Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Woolwich at 4.29am and complained of hearing voices and said she had not slept for six weeks. She was referred to the specialist psychiatric team at Oxleas House and told to wait in Accident and Emergency. Manslaughter: Nicola Edgington stabbed her mother Marion, pictured, to death in 2005 . Receptionist Sylvia Rogers told the court: 'She started to get agitated and came up to the desk. 'She was asking how long it was going to take because she didn't want to be there. She was getting very agitated. 'She was saying there was no reason for her to be there and not in Oxleas.' Mrs Rogers said she asked the patient to sit down and wait but Edgington replied: 'Is it going to take me to kill someone as I did before for me to get seen?' While she was waiting to be transferred Edgington made a series of 999 calls warning she was dangerous and might harm someone. Later that morning she was taken to the Oxleas Unit at around 7.05am but announced: 'I'm going to call my care coordinator' and left the building. Edgington took a series of buses to Bexleyheath where she bought a knife and attacked Kerry Clark, 24. Miss Clark managed to disarm her but Edgington went into a butcher's shop where she stole a second 12-inch knife. She then attacked Mrs Hodkin - a married grandmother who worked for law firm Cunningham Blake in nearby Blackheath as an accounts manager - as she made her way to the office. Edgington admits carrying out the attacks but claims she did not intend to kill Miss Clark and her responsibility for the death of Mrs Hodkin is diminished by her mental state. Edgington, of Flavell Mews, Greenwich, southeast London, denies murder and attempted murder. The trial continues. Killed: The house in East Sussex where Marion Edgington's body was found in 2005 .

Police are warning swimmers to be on their guard after a great white shark was spotted just 200 yards of the Florida coast. The shark, which goes by the name Mary Lee, is 16 feet long and weighs 3,456 pounds. Together with another great white, called Genie, both sharks have been fitted with electronic tags to keep track of them. However the tags haven't been fitted by local police concerned about swimmers' safety, instead a nonprofit organization is tracking the sharks for altogether different reasons. Great white shark Mary Lee was briefly captured last September so researchers could insert an electronic tag in her . Mary Lee was fitted with electronic tag last September to enable Ocearch to track her . Last September, researchers from Ocearch, which studies oceans and fish, embarked on a project to tag two sharks off the coast of Cape Cod, Massachusetts. The purpose of the project is to learn more about how the sharks live and their breeding habits in order to better protect them. This week, three months after their tagging, much to the surprise of the scientists both Mary Lee and Genie were spotted swimming off the coast of Nassau County. ‘It's really odd to me that we only tagged two sharks in Cape Cod,’ Ocearch's chairman Chris Fischer told Fox 35. ‘And both of those sharks are off Jacksonville. That's 100 percent of our sample size.’ The online shark tracker tool enables users to track the whereabouts of both Mary Lee and Genie . With 73 million sharks killed every year for human consumption, Fisher is hoping the project will help create awareness about these giant creatures. Scientists have long suspected that sharks swam south for the winter and researchers are predicting that both will stay in the warm Florida waters for the winter. Police are urging swimmers and surfers to remain vigilant and not to get too close. There is even an online tool on the Ocearch website that enables people to keep track of the whale’s movements.

A middle-class mother of three stole more than £30,000 from her bosses to fund chronic eating binges. Susan Foxcroft, 47, spent more than £100 each day gorging on sandwiches, sweets and drinks. She told a court she had suffered from severe bulimia and anorexia for 16 years and that she had become trapped in a spiral of bingeing and purging. Jailed: Mother of three Susan Foxcroft said she had diverted cash from her company because she did not want her husband to find out about her eating disorder . Foxcroft claimed she took the money to keep the disorder hidden from her husband. She was able to transfer large sums into her bank account because she worked as a book-keeper at the firm. Yesterday she was branded ‘thoroughly . dishonest’ by a judge who sentenced her to three and a half years in . jail. Judge Patrick Field QC said that, although she had admitted two . counts of fraud, she had shown no remorse. He added: ‘I have plenty of . sympathy for you and for your eating disorder but it constitutes no . excuse whatsoever for what you have done.’ Foxcroft, whose children are grown-up, . lived with her husband, Jonathan, 49, in a smart £240,000 detached home . in Rossendale, Lancashire. Fraud: Foxcroft forged letters from her boss at Welding Engineers (Mersey) Ltd to cover up her crimes . She oversaw the finances at Welding Engineers in Manchester, which makes and installs industrial doors. Manchester Crown Court heard she began . using bank transfers and company cheques to siphon off money. Between . 2009 and 2011 she took a total of £31,302, leaving the firm with dire . financial problems. John Richards, defending, said: ‘She’s been suffering from severe bulimia and anorexia for 16 years. Further damage: Foxcroft sent Mr Austin threatening texts and falsely claimed that the firm had been dodging taxes, sparking an investigation into the company . ‘She has confidence and self-image . problems, and most importantly, as regards the commission of this . offence, she tells me she was spending upwards of £100 a day on food.’ Foxcroft, was exposed only when . bankruptcy proceedings against her led to an investigation of her . finances.

"By . Hugo Gye . PUBLISHED: . 04:31 EST, 9 January 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 04:31 EST, 9 January 2013 . Train punctuality has tumbled to its lowest level for two years - and railway officials do not expect to meet their targets for arriving on time until the end of the decade. The admission comes despite the announcement of plans to invest £37.5billion into the rail network - which will require several more years of inflation-busting price hikes. According to data released by Network Rail, train punctuality has never consistently reached its target of 92.5 per cent, and stood at just 85.3 per cent in November/December 2012. Just two of the 15 private rail operators hit the punctuality target in the latest period, with several - particularly those running long-distance lines - recording figures of no better than 80 per cent. Punctuality: The blue line shows what proportion of trains arrive on time month-by-month; the red line shows a moving annual average; and the green line shows the trains arriving within one minute of schedule . The figures record a train as being late if it is more than five minutes behind schedule for a short-distance service, or 10 minutes for long-distance. Alternative statistics measuring how often trains arrived within one minute of their scheduled time show that just 57.1 per cent of service are precisely on time - a number falling to 41.9 per cent for long-distance services. When NR announced its development plans for 2014-19, it admitted that the 92.5 per cent target would not be met until the end of that period. The company resisted pressure to set a more ambitious target - and warned that 'increasingly congested' trains would make it hard to make any further progress on punctuality. Expansion: New plans to upgrade Britain's train systems have been announced by Network Rail . 'We want to do better than that, but we are facing up to some problems that come with success - that is, more trains and more passengers on an increasingly congested network,' a spokesman said. 'Even the smallest delay at busy times can cause a ripple effect which disrupts passengers several hours later, hundreds of miles away.' Despite the failure to increase the number of trains arriving on time over the past two years, NR's plans for Britain's trains assume that fares will continue to rise by one per cent above inflation. Its scheme for the next seven years was announced yesterday, just days after most fares went up by an average of 4.2 per cent. A top railway official said the plan was dependent on fares rising each year at a rate of one per cent above the RPI inflation rate, and added that any change to that assumption would require a larger subsidy from the taxpayer. The subsidy is instead scheduled to fall to no more than £2.9billion by 2019, down from £4.5billion a decade earlier. Tight squeeze: NR hopes to introduce 170,000 extra seats on the morning commute . Given the size of the national deficit and the Government's commitment to fiscal austerity, ministers are unlikely to reverse their course on reducing the subsidy. The NR plan for 2014-19 will provide 170,000 extra morning commuter seats at peak times, including a 20 per cent increase on services into central London. The firm also envisages 225million more passengers per year travelling by 2019, and 355,000 more trains in service. Specific projects include various electrification schemes, such as the Great Western and Midland Main Lines, station improvements at Birmingham and Reading, and reopening 31 miles of railways in Scotland closed under the Beeching cuts 50 years ago. NR chief executive Sir David Higgins warned that the railway network had 'entered an era of trade-offs' and would have to compromise over the various demands made on it. 'Increasingly we have to balance the need to build more infrastructure, run trains on time and cut costs, and in many areas choices will need to be made,' he said.","Just 85.3% of trains arrived on time in December despite 92.5% target .

"Haul was hidden in 31 duffel bags along with cash, coins and a handgun . By . Daniel Miller . PUBLISHED: . 04:38 EST, 9 January 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 05:43 EST, 9 January 2013 . Haul: Career burglar John Suddard was arrested at a pawn shop. Police . later discovered 31 duffel bags stuffed with jewellery at the home of his . brother-in-law . A career burglar has been found with a stash of 30,000 items of jewellery after being arrested trying to sell stolen goods at a pawn shop. John Suddard, 39, who has served three prisons . terms for burglary since he was 19, was arrested in the Albany area on December 31 attempting . to pawn jewellery and coins which he is believed to have stolen a day . earlier in nearby Hudson Falls, Vermont. New York State Police later discovered the haul  which included pearl necklaces, gold chains, bracelets, coins, silverware and other valuables hidden in 31 duffel bags along with cash, coins, a handgun and game tokens. The duffel bags were found on the property of Suddard's brother-in-law, who is cooperating with the investigation. Police believe most of the items were . stolen since Suddard's last release from prison in 2007. He operated mostly . in the cluster of three counties around Hudson Falls, though it's not . clear how far Suddard traveled. He also spent some time in other . Northeastern states and in Florida. Suddard is being held in jail without . bail on charges of possessing stolen property. It wasn't clear whether . he had a lawyer and he declined a phone interview from jail. In an attempt to find the owners of the stolen items police in Hudson Falls near the Vermont border, will tonight put the items on display at the local high school. Burglary victims will be invited in, and an officer will escort them around tables set up in the cafeteria to see if any of the items are theirs. Stash: A small selection of some of the 30,000 items of jewellery discovered by police including pearl necklaces, gold chains, bracelets, coins, silverware . One of Suddard's possible victims Francesco . Venturiello, whose Schenectady home was burglarized in May lost cash . and roughly $75,000 worth his wife's jewelry, including irreplaceable . pieces bought in Italy. He said: 'I swear to God, if we find anything in there, I'm going to have to call an ambulance. My wife will faint.' Career criminal: Lt. John Durling of the New York State Police shows a picture of Suddard, who has served three prisons terms for burglary since he was 19, during a news conference at Hudson Falls Village Court . Hudson Falls Police Chief Randy . Diamond said items recovered so far link Suddard to 24 burglaries, . though there could be many more. Police say the burglar's method of operation was basic: Wait until people leave their house, break in and search for cash and jewelry. He worked mostly in colder months, when the sun sets earlier. He struck whether the homeowners were gone for weeks or minutes. He kept burglar's tools and a camouflage ski mask in his car, police said. 'Seldom did he actually encounter anybody in the house,' Washington County Undersheriff John Winchell said. 'There were a couple of times when he was spooked - people showed up and he had to run out the back door. ... Generally, his crimes went unnoticed for days.' The suspect pretty much stole 'anything somebody would throw in their jewelry box,' Winchell said, and then some. 'One of the bags I went through actually had an adult molar,' Winchell said, 'right down to the roots.' Chief Diamond said it appears that Suddard pawned the most expensive items and may have held on to the remaining booty to sell later. Of the items recovered, a small number have inscriptions linking them to victims. The display at Hudson Falls High School on Wednesday is for the items that can't be identified. The viewing is restricted to people who reported a burglary and have a police report. 'Victims will not be allowed to take identified items home just yet, because they are still potential evidence. Search: Police in Hudson Falls are taking the novel step of displaying the items at the local high school tonight in an attempt to find their rightful owners . Diamond said the department has been inundated with calls from as far away as New Jersey and New Hampshire, some from callers missing cars, boats and other items clearly not involved in this case. With interest so heavy, police plan to do at least one more display after Wednesday.'We've caught this guy; we need to link him to what we can and return the property that we can,' Diamond said.","Items on display at local high school in an attempt to find rightful owners .

Kate Winslet’s husband yesterday attempted to ban photographs of him semi-naked in fancy dress from being published. Ned RocknRoll, who married the Hollywood actress a few weeks ago, was in London’s High Court to try to ban a tabloid newspaper from printing the pictures taken of him indulging in ‘silly schoolboy antics’. The images of the 34-year-old, who is a nephew of Sir Richard Branson, were discovered on a Facebook page. Kate Winslet's husband Ned RocknRoll, pictured together, yesterday attempted to ban photographs of him semi-naked in fancy dress from being published . RocknRoll, who changed his surname from Edward Abel Smith, was granted a temporary injunction last Thursday, shortly after The Sun newspaper contacted Winslet’s publicist about the pictures. The newspaper yesterday contested the injunction and the case will continue today. The Sun’s publisher, News International subsidiary News Group Newspapers, argued the pictures, which were taken from a publicly accessible Facebook profile belonging to RocknRoll’s friend, James Pope, were already publicly available. The group also said that RocknRoll is a public figure and has a lower reasonable expectation of privacy than an ordinary private citizen. RocknRoll’s lawyer, David Sherborne, told the court yesterday that the pictures of a ‘partly naked’ Rocknroll in a fancy dress costume were taken at a private party, which had the theme ‘outrageous’ and would cause distress to him if they were printed. RocknRoll, pictured leaving court, was granted a temporary injunction last Thursday, shortly after The Sun newspaper contacted Winslet's publicist about the pictures . Mr Sherborne told the court: ‘This application is not to hide some guilty secret, as I said in the interim hearing. It is not to keep something secret. The claimant is here because the defendant seeks to invade his privacy. ‘It was a private party with a private guestlist at a private family home so it is hard to see these photographs as anything other than private family photos.’ He told the court and judge Mr Justice Briggs that the photos showed Rocknroll indulging in ‘silly schoolboy antics at this fancy dress party. It is embarrassing because of what you can see in these pictures.’ Mr Sherborne added that RocknRoll was ‘horrified’ at the prospect of the pictures being published. He explained that they were never intended for public consumption and would cause ‘considerable embarrassment and humiliation’ for Winslet and her children, who would face bullying and taunting if they were made public. He also said that he was not a role model and had been a ‘relative nobody’ prior to his marriage to Winslet in December. RocknRoll, who was previously head of marketing for Branson’s Virgin Galactic space-exploration firm before leaving to work as a sheep farmer, was in court wearing a blue pinstripe suit, married the Titanic star in a low-key ceremony in New York in December. The hearing follows the publication of a report in March last year by the Joint Committee on Privacy and Injunctions that found there was no case for a new privacy law and that cases should still be judged by the courts on an individual basis. RocknRoll is the latest in a long line of well-known figures to use an injunction to prevent the publication of detail of his private life. In 2011, Sir Fred Goodwin, the disgraced banker who took the Royal Bank of Scotland to the brink of collapse, was revealed as another figure who had taken out a controversial High Court super-injunction. The order, which bans mention of matters Sir Fred wishes to keep secret, was disclosed in the Commons by Liberal Democrat MP John Hemming using parliamentary privilege. In 2011, footballer Ryan Giggs took out a super-injunction banning newspapers from printing details of his affair with model Imogen Thomas, despite his identity being widely discussed across the internet. Hemming again used parliamentary privilege to name the player, saying 75,000 people had already outed him on Twitter.

Kenney admitted to having hypnotised 17-year-old Brittany Palumbo five months . before she killed herself on May 4 last year. He also held hypnosis sessions with . 16-year-old Marcus Freeman six days before he died in a car wreck on . March 15. All three were students at his school. 'They are just trying to pick someone to blame it on.' Former student Kallie Dremann . A report was filed by school chiefs last June . who found that Kenney had lied to officials about hypnosis sessions and . defied three separate orders to stop the practice. He first told police he never hypnotised Miss Palumbo but later admitted he had lied.The report revealed Kenney hypnotized up to 75 people at the school, including students and their parents, as well as staff members and their children. A teacher at the school, Linda Thornton, 68, was also killed in a car wreck while driving to work in November 2010. It is not known whether she was hypnotised by Kenney. Kenney has claimed the students were . happy to be hypnotised as it helped them concentrate in class. Many had . been taking part in competitive sports and he said the hypnosis helped . them focus. In defence: Students including (l-r) Kallie Dremann, Eric Williams and Josh Lang have all been hypnotised by their former principal Dr Kenney . Private sessions: Dr Kenney is said to have hypnotised 75 pupils, teachers and members of their families at North Port High School in Florida . Many pupils at North Port High School have come out to defend Dr Kenney and Facebook groups have been set up called 'Bring Back Dr Kenney' and 'Students in Support of Dr. George Kenney'. One former student Eric Williams, 20, was the first person Dr Kenney ever hypnotised. He told Good Morning America that his SAT scores 'went up 500 points after the hypnosis'. When asked about her fellow students' deaths, another former pupil Kallie Dremann added: 'They are just trying to pick someone to blame it on.' He has published a number of audio CDs which are sold on Amazon. One uses hypnosis to help defeat anxiety while others focus on sports - baseball pitching and batting along with improving basketball throws. Kenney became a certified hypnotist after attending the Omni Hypnosis Training Centre in Deland, Florida. On the market: Dr George Kenney sells hypnosis audio CDs on Amazon . An investigation had revealed that Wesley McKinley, who had showed no outward sign of depression, got his mother's signed approval to take part in the session with his high school principal. But his parents later said they had a 'ton of questions' and wondered if the hypnosis had played a part in their son's decision to take his own life. According to ABC, private investigators hired by the school district interviewed Kenney, who has been at the Florida school for a decade, over the allegations. The reported stated that the principal said he felt terrible about 'putting his school and his students through something that they didn't need or deserve to have to endure on top of all the tragedy they already have experienced"" and started to cry.","George Kenney removed from post after treating 75 students and teachers .

An excavation team searching for a stash of legendary World War II-era British fighter aircraft in northern Myanmar said today it had found a wooden crate believed to contain one of the planes, but it was full of muddy water. It was not immediately clear how much damage the water may have caused, and searchers could not definitively say what was inside the crate. But British aviation enthusiast David Cundall, who is driving the hunt for the rare Spitfire planes, called the results 'very encouraging.' Research materials of the buried British Spitfires are displayed on a board during a press conference in Myanmar, Burma, where a British excavation team have found a crate they believe contains one of the planes . The wooden crate was located in northern Myanmar was found in Myitkyina in Kachin state during a dig that began last month . 'It will take some time to pump the . water out ... but I do expect all aircraft to be in very good . condition,' Cundall told reporters in Myanmar's main city, Yangon. The . single-seater Spitfire, which helped Britain beat back waves of German . bombers during the war more than six decades ago, remains the most . famous British combat aircraft. Britain . built a total of about 20,000 Spitfires, although the dawn of the jet . age meant the propeller-driven planes quickly became obsolete. As . many as 140 Spitfires - three to four times the number of airworthy . models known to exist - are believed to have been buried in . near-pristine condition in Myanmar by American engineers as the war drew . to a close.

The wooden crate located in northern Myanmar was found in Myitkyina in Kachin state during a dig that began last month. It is one of several digs planned nationwide, including another near the airport in Yangon. Cundall said the search team in Kachin state inserted a camera into the crate and found it was full of water. It was unclear what was inside the crate, he said, but the water will be pumped out during an operation that could take weeks, he said. The go-ahead for excavation came in October when Myanmar's government signed an agreement with Cundall and his local partner. Hopeful: David Cundall, pictured in front of a spitfire at the Imperial War Museum in London, hopes the planes will still be in 'first-class condition' One of the Spitfires (pictured: the tail fins) being crated up in Burma in 1945 ready to be buried .

DJC, a private company headed by . Cundall, will get 30 percent of the total and the Myanmar partner . company Shwe Taung Paw, headed by Htoo Htoo Zaw, will get 20 percent. During the project's first phase, . searchers hope to recover 60 planes: 36 planes in Mingaladon, near . Yangon's international airport; six in Meikthila in central Myanmar; and . 18 in Myitkyina. Others are to be recovered in a second phase. Searchers . hope the aircraft are in pristine condition, but others have said it's . possible all they might find is a mass of corroded metal and rusty . aircraft parts. Cundall said the practice of burying aircraft, tanks and jeeps was common after the war. 'Basically . nobody had got any orders to take these airplanes back to (the) UK. They were just surplus ... (and) one way of disposing them was to bury . them,' Cundall said. 'The war was over, everybody wanted to go home, . nobody wanted anything, so you just buried it and went home. That was . it.' Stanley Coombe, a . 91-year-old war veteran from Britain who says he witnessed the . aircraft's burial, traveled to Myanmar to observe the search.

"By . Tim Shipman . PUBLISHED: . 17:44 EST, 8 January 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 03:47 EST, 9 January 2013 . Business minister Lord Marland has decided to step down after becoming frustrated with the grind of Whitehall . David Cameron suffered a fresh setback last night when he lost his second minister in as many days. Tory business minister Lord Marland – the Prime Minister’s personal trade envoy – told Mr Cameron of his decision to quit at lunchtime on Tuesday . He will, however, continue in his envoy role. Lord Marland, 56, said he wanted to leave his main role because he was frustrated with the daily grind of Whitehall and wants to concentrate on the trade role for which he thinks he is more suited. He also wants more time to concentrate on his business career. His surprise decision emerged after Lord Strathclyde resigned as Leader of the House of Lords on Monday, the day of the Coalition relaunch. Lord Strathclyde blamed the irritations of working with the Liberal Democrats for his decision to quit. But the disclosure that a second minister is leaving because he does not enjoy government will raise fresh questions about the true state of relations between the Tories and Lib Dems. Labour made hay with the announcement, declaring it a case of ‘two Lords a leaping’.  Lord Marland is a highly influential figure in Conservative circles, having served as Tory Party treasurer, and has been a key link man to wealthy donors whose support Mr Cameron will need to fill his election war chest. Mr Cameron made him a central player in his bid to focus both foreign and economic policy on the need to drum up business around the world. Lord Marland was in charge of intellectual property issues and was responsible for piloting the Government’s Enterprise and Regulatory Reform Bill through the Lords – a process which is not yet complete. He has also enjoyed a long career in the City. A founding director of insurance multi-national Jardine Lloyd Thompson, he also led the acquisition of Hunter Boots, which saved the company from closure. Lord Marland, who lives in the grade-II* listed Odstock Manor, Wiltshire, stood as a Tory Parliamentary candidate in 2001 but lost to Lib Dem David Heath in the Somerton and Frome seat before serving as Tory treasurer between 2003 and 2007. David Cameron has seen two peers step down in the space of two days following Lord Marland's decision . The father of four was made a life peer in 2006 and was treasurer for Boris Johnson’s successful campaign for London mayor in 2008. In May 2011 he was appointed as the chairman of the British Business Ambassadors by UK Trade & Investment, the branch of government which fights to win deals overseas. Lord Strathclyde resigned as Leader of the House of Lords on Monday, blaming the frustrations of working with the Liberal Democrats . He is understood to have several overseas trips planned to bring in business which he hopes will return the economy to robust growth. Lord Marland told Mr Cameron of his decision yesterday lunchtime. One friend said: ‘He wants to do what he is good at, which is drumming up trade. You get growth by doing deals, not piloting Bills through the House of Lords.’ A senior Government source told the Mail: ‘He has been frustrated by the day-to-day business of government. He also wants to get back to the private sector and there isn’t the time to do that and perform all the duties of a minister at the same time.’ Another source said: ‘He wants  to go and pursue his business interests. He felt that the things he wanted to do in business he couldn’t do as a minister.’ Lord Marland’s decision ‘came as a surprise’ to Mr Cameron, insiders said. The loss of two well-connected grandees will be keenly felt in Downing Street, where aides valued Lord Strathclyde’s political judgment and Lord Marland’s understanding of the business community.","Lord Marland quits after becoming frustrated in Whitehall .

Athletes of all levels have always needed to monitor the possible danger of concussion on the sports field. Now, a new gadget aims to simplify the assessment of a blow to the head, before producing an immediate signal about the severity of the incident. CheckLight, a skull cap produced by Reebok and electronics company mc10, fits underneath a helmet and uses sensor technology to monitor impact. Safety first: The new skull cap will instantly analyze and indicate impact on the head during contact sports . The control module at the back of the cap will flash yellow for moderate impact and red for severe blows to the head . As reported by Engadget, the device then flashes a color-coded LED on the strength of the blow for all to see. Mc10 claim on their website that this 'smart, sensing skullcap serves as an extra set of eyes on the playing field, giving players, parents, coaches and trainers a visual measurement of force of impact to put athletes on a pathway to assessment.' A strip of flexible plastic inside the cap is packed full of sensors, measuring multi-directional and rotational acceleration, as well as the location and duration of impact. According to Engadget, all this technology is connected to a microcontroller module at the back of the cap with three indicator LEDs. The sophisticated sensors inside the cap measure multi-directional and rotational acceleration, as well as the location and duration of head impact . The technological cap fits round the head, so measures impact extremely accurately and it can also be used with multiple helmets . One light shows the status of the rechargeable battery on board, then a yellow LED flashes after moderate blows to the head and the third light flashes red after severe impact. This ensures that immediately after a potentially dangerous collision, everyone on the field is immediately notified. Mc10 hope that this will remove one of the biggest problems with concussion injuries - the fact that sports players often don't even report such incidents. As the new product provides immediate and simple information, the makers hope that sports teams will be able to look out for and police each other. The CheckLight fits round the users' head, rather being a part of the helmet, ensuring that it accurately measures potential damage to the body rather than just impact to the protective equipment. As such, the skull cap can also be used with a number of different helmets. Both Reebok and mc10 hope the equipment will be used at all sporting levels, including youth athletics. When Engadget asked Isaiah Kacyvenski - mc10's Director of Licensing and Business development and ex-NFL player - about the potential cost of the device, he said it would be 'affordable and comparable to the cost of other sporting equipment.' CheckLight will be available in the first half of 2013. The dangers of concussion have long been a concern for athletes playing contact sports, especially in NFL. Legendary NFL linebacker Junior Seau was found to have a degenerative brain disease caused by repeated blows to the head when he committed suicide in May 2012 . On Thursday, analysis of the brain of NFL legend Junior Seau revealed that when he committed suicide last year he was suffering from a degenerative brain disease often linked with repeated blows to the head. Researchers from the National Institutes of Health said that the former football star's abnormalities were consistent with chronic traumatic encephalopathy, or CTE. The hard-hitting linebacker played for 20 NFL seasons with San Diego, Miami and New England before retiring in 2009. He died at age 43 of a self-inflicted gunshot to his chest in May 2012, and his family requested the analysis of his brain. 'We saw changes in his behavior and things that didn't add up with him,' his ex-wife, Gina, told The Associated Press. 'But (CTE) was not something we considered or even were aware of. But pretty immediately (after the suicide) doctors were trying to get their hands on Junior's brain to examine it.' The family of Junior Seau spotted 'changes in his behavior and things that didn't add up with him.' This was a result of degenerative brain disease caused by repeated concussions .","CheckLight, the new technological skull cap, analyses impact to the head during contact sports, then signals the severity of the incident .

Chilling details have emerged in the gruesome case of the the Minnesota man . accused of fatally shooting two teenagers as they broke into his home on Thanksgiving . Day. According to an audio recording of the incident, the man, Byron David Smith, shot the teenage girl,  Haile Kifer, in the chest and then taunted the 18-year-old, telling her she was dying in the final moments of her life, before repeatedly shot her until she died. Smith had allegedly shot the girl's companion Nicholas Brady, 17, minutes earlier. Police say the killer dragged their bodies to a workshop, where he kept them for a day. Scroll down for video . Killed: The bodies of cousins Haile Kifer, 18, left, and Nicholas Brady, 17, right, were found stashed in the . basement of a man who claimed the teens broke into his home on . Thanksgiving . Authorities learned of the accused killer's interaction with the teens from video and . audio recordings while searching Smith's home. They subsequently seized . several computer memory cards and computer equipment, according to the Star Tribune. Smith, a retired U.S. State . Department employee, was charged Monday with two counts of murder. According to the criminal complaint, Smith shot the teens multiple . times. In custody: Byron Smith was arrested after admitting to police he had killed the teens a day earlier . He told investigators his home had been broken into several times before. Minnesota . law gives homeowners the right to protect themselves and their . property, but Wetzel said they don't have the right to execute an . intruder once the threat is neutralized. Johnson told the Star Tribune: 'The whole thing is . very sad that they lost their lives. In the same instance, if they . hadn't been breaking into houses, they'd be alive.' Smith told authorities that he was in his basement last Thursday when he heard a window break upstairs. In a criminal complaint, Smith said . he was in the basement of his home when he heard a window breaking and . footsteps. Fearful of other recent break-ins, he shot Brady when he came into view. When the teenager tumbled down the stars, Smith shot him in the face as he lay on the floor, looking up. He dragged the body into his workshop . and then sat in the chair, the complaint said. When Kifer began walking . down the stairs, he shot her and she fell down the stairs. He tried to shoot her again with his rifle, but the gun jammed and Kifer laughed at him, the complaint noted. 'If you're trying to shoot somebody and . they laugh at you, you go again,' Smith, 64, told investigators, according to a criminal complaint filed . Monday. He then shot her several times in the chest with a . .22-caliber revolver, dragged her next to her cousin, and with as she . gasped for air, fired a shot under her chin 'up into the cranium'. 'Smith described it as ""a good clean finishing shot"",' according to the . compliant, but acknowledged that he had fired 'more shots than . (he) needed to'. Smith said . he left the bodies in his home overnight before calling a neighbor to . ask if he knew a good lawyer. He later asked the neighbor to contact . police. Another break-in? A day before they were shot to death in Byron Smith's home, a car driven by Brady was spotted in the driveway of Richard L. Johnson's home in Little Falls . A prosecutor at Morrison County District Court . on Monday morning called Smith's reaction 'appalling. On . Monday, he was charged with second-degree murder and police revealed he . told them he fired more shots than necessary after his gun jammed and . Kifer laughed at him. While Minnesota law stipulates people are allowed to use deadly force when defending their . homes, relatives, friends, police and prosecutors claimed Smith reacted too drastically by killing them. 'A . person has every right to defend themselves and their homes, even . employing deadly force if necessary,' Morrison County Sheriff Michel . Wetzel said. 'Circumstances of this case however, led deputies to . believe that Smith went beyond that point.' Before the burglary was discovered, . deputies were called to Smith's neighborhood because a red Mitsubishi . Eclipse was spotted in the driveway of a home owned by Richard L. Johnson, Morrison County Sheriff Michel Wetzel said. Nicholas . Brady, 17, had been driving that car, although it wasn't registered to . him. Deputies questioned him, but then let him go, Wetzel said. A day later, Byron Smith shot and killed Brady and Brady's 18-year-old cousin, Haile Kifer, in the basement of his Little Falls home. Smith told authorities that he disturbed the pair as they tried to break into his house and that he shot them in self-defense. Missed: Friends and teacher expressed their shock at deaths and described Haile as a popular role model . Joker: Friends also remembered Brady as an out-going student who loved to make people smile . The same red Mitsubishi Eclipse was discovered Friday parked around the corner from Smith's property. 'There are some preliminary . indications that the Johnson burglary may have been committed by the . Brady boy and the Kifer girl, but it's too early now to say . definitively,' Wetzel said, adding that more information could be made . available later today. The . Minneapolis StarTribune reported that Johnson, a retired high school . teacher, had been in Spain and did not know his home had been . burglarized until he returned to the home on Sunday. Johnson . told the paper that he reported several items stolen from his house, . including less than $5 in pennies kept in a box on his dresser, silver . and copper coins, and some prescription medication, including drugs for . diabetes and controlling cholesterol. Wetzel couldn't immediately say whether any of those missing items were found in Brady's car. In addition, Johnson reported a sliding glass door that had been broken. 'I . do know they found quite a bit of evidence in their vehicle that was . parked near the Smith place,' the sheriff said late Tuesday. 'We're . trying to investigate whether it might have come from the Johnson . burglary.' Scene: Smith's home in Little Falls, MN has been burglarized eight times in recent years, his brother said . 'Mr. Smith intentionally killed two teenagers in his home in a matter . that goes well beyond self-defense,' Morrison County Attorney Brian . Middendorf said at a hearing on Monday. Friends have taken to a memorial Facebook page for Kifer and Schaeffel to vent their anger about the deaths. Others spoke out at a vigil for the youngsters on Sunday night. 'They were just really great people,' friend Rachel Stauffer, 15, told the Star Tribune. 'They . could make anyone laugh.' Carlee Davich, who coached Kifer in swimming at school, added: 'She was . always happy. She had a way that just made everyone happy. A lot of the . swimmers and divers looked up to her.' Emma Schmidt, a fellow classmate at Little Falls High School, said Kifer was talented and well-liked . and 'everyone's wondering' what she was doing in Smith's basement. Further . insight into the lives of the cousins was given by Brady's sister, . Crystal Shaeffel, as she visited Smith's home and spoke with his . brother. 'They were 17 and 18 years old, and didn't need to die,' she told Bruce Smith. Pain: Crystal Shaeffel, 27, cries after walking up the driveway of the home of Byron David Smith in Little Falls, Minnesota where her brother Nick Brady was shot and killed on Thursday . Remembered: At a candle-lit vigil on Sunday, Rachel Brady speaks about her brother Nick to the crowd . 'That . all depends on your perspective,' he responded, referring to a series . of break-ins his brother had endured. In one in October, thieves stole . $10,000 worth of guns and electronics, he said. But Shaeffel insisted that her brother had no . need to turn to burglary, as he made good money working for their . father's tree-trimming business. She added that her cousin, who had undergone treatment for substance abuse, could have been after pills from the home. 'Yes, she had an addiction problem and stuff, but that doesn't mean she . deserves to get murdered at 18 years old,' Shaeffel said. 'I understand . they came there to rob them, or whatever, but shoot them in the shoulder . and call the cops.' On the Facebook page, friends agreed that the shootings were too severe. 'It doesn't matter what they . were or weren't doing there,' Mike Boulley wrote. 'They were KIDS that didn't deserve to die. Defending your property against armed burglars is one thing, gunning . down two unarmed teenagers is just inexcusable.' Support: Friends on a memorial Facebook page have asked whether the appropriate force was used . Logan Ayres added: 'It's hard to see . such nice people lose their lives to something that could of been so . easily taken care of instead of murder. R.I.P. nick and halie (sic) you will . be dearly missed.' Smith, 64, is currently being held on $2million bail. According to his friends, Smith said . that he had didn’t go to police immediately after the shooting because . he panicked about the deaths. 'He . was very traumatized by what had occurred and didn’t know who to call . or what to do and that is very sad that the whole thing even happened,' Kathy Lange told KSTP-TV. His brother, Bruce Smith, said that this was the latest of eight burglaries he had suffered in recent years. Byron Smith said that he suspected that the two had been responsible for at least some of those past robberies.

The president was being given a tour of the Wat Pho monastery in Bangkok, Thailand, on the first stop of his Asia trip when he asked head monk Chaokun Suthee Thammanuwat for some extra help. TV cameras picked up Hilary Clinton making a reference to budget negotiations back in Washington, where a series of potentially damaging tax increases and spending cuts loom. Scroll down for video .

TV cameras picked up the President tell his tour guide: 'We're working on this budget.

The President and Secretary of State Clinton enjoyed a private tour of the stunning temple - a popular tourist destination in Bangkok's Phra Nakhon district. Observing traditional custom, they took off their shoes as the saffron-robed monk led them through the 18th century compound of multi-colored spires and chapels with its hundreds of gilded Buddha images. The main attraction is the impressive reclining Buddha statue that at 46 meters long, and 15 meters high, stretches half the length of a football field. The statue is made of bricks and plaster and covered in gold leaf with mother-of-pearl inlay decorating the feet. Mrs Clinton remarked about how peaceful . it was  to which Mr Obama replied: 'If you have 80,000 people here it's . not so peaceful. This is kind of a treat.' Observing traditional custom, Obama and Clinton took off their shoes as they were led through the complex . At a news conference later, Obama said he was not joking about the need for prayer. 'I . always believe in prayers,' he said. 'I believe in prayer when I go to . church back home, and If a Buddhist monk is wishing me well, I'll take . whatever good vibes he can give me to try to deal with some challenges . back home.'

Obama entered a hospital meeting room with Clinton behind him. The king remained seated as Obama greeted him and grasped his hand. 'It's a great honor,' Obama said. Obama said he brought greetings from . the American people 'who are so grateful for the friendship of our two . countries and are great admirers of yours - your wisdom and your . leadership.' The king responded in a soft tone. Obama . smiled and said, 'Elections in the United States are very long, but . it's very gratifying to know people still have confidence in me.

An eco-warrior and reality TV star has been sued amid claims that he secretly sank a boat he had borrowed and blamed its demise on Japanese whalers. Paul Watson, star of Whale Wars, is accused of sabotaging the show's Ady Gil boat to gain more publicity for his life-long battle against whaling and to raise more funds. The 62-year-old is being sued by the vessel's owner Ady Gil who loaned the boat to the crew and cast of Whale Wars. Scroll down for video .

Under attack: The boat Ady Gil, ebing used by members of the Sea Shepherd Conservation, is hit with a power hose and then rammed by Japanese whalers in 2010 . A lawsuit was filed by Mr Gil on Monday at an LA court seeking $5million in damages from Mr Watson, who is a co-founder of Greenpeace and head of the Sea Shepherd Society. Mr Gil, a Los Angeles-based millionaire businessman, contends that the boat only had damage to the nose after it was rammed by Japanese fisherman in 2010 and could have been repaired. According to TMZ, Mr Watson had the boat sunk 'under the cover of darkness'. Watson resigned from his role as head of the Sea Shepherd society this week. The civil lawsuit adds to the woes of Mr Watson who is at the center of a legal battle to have him extradited to Costa Rica to face a 2002 attempted murder charge.

The charges stem from an incident . where Watson and the team from Sea Shepherd allegedly endangered the . lives of a fishing boat crew in 2002. Watson has said that the team spotted a Costa Rican fishing boat hunting for sharks in Guatemalan waters. The U.S.-based Sea Shepherds has a history of waging aggressive campaigns to protect whales, dolphins and other marine animals. A sixth season of Whale Wars is expected to be made by Discovery and appear on the Animal Planet channel.

A traffic stop turned into a fatal shooting on Christmas Eve when a gunman killed a police officer and bystander in the parking lot of a Houston body shop, police said. The confrontation followed a chase that began shortly before 9am Monday when the suspect sped off in his car rather than pull over as an officer had requested, Houston police spokesman John Cannon said. As the suspect fled, he sideswiped a white truck, which also took off after him, he said. Confirmed dead: This undated photo from the Bellaire Police Department shows Cpl. Jimmie Norman who was one of two people shot and killed by a motorist who fled following a traffic stop in Houston, Texas, on Christmas Eve . The suspect, identified by Cannon as Harlem Harold Lewis, 21, and the white truck eventually pulled into a nearby Maaco body shop, where Bellaire police Cpl. Jimmie Norman approached the vehicle. Cannon said an argument apparently erupted, and the suspect pulled out a .380 caliber handgun and shot Norman. 'The saddest thing is that the officer, who is deceased, didn't have the opportunity to pull his weapon and defend himself,’ Cannon said. ‘It happened that fast.’ He said a man then walked out of the body shop, and the suspect shot him. Investigating: Police investigate the scene where Bellaire police officer Norman and an unnamed bystander were shot to death after the motorist, identified by police as Harlem Harold Lewis, 21, opened fire . Fatal shooting: The morning traffic stop turned into a fatal shooting when the gunman killed Norman and the unidentified bystander in the parking lot of a Houston body shop, police say . Other officers arrived at the scene and found Norman lying on the ground and the suspect next to him, holding a gun, Cannon said. ‘They are immediately fired upon, and those two officers then returned fire,’ he said. The suspect was shot but fled on foot, Cannon said. He hid under a parked truck, but officers followed a trail of blood and arrested him. ‘This suspect murdered a police officer and murdered an innocent bystander,’ Cannon said. He said Lewis was expected to be charged later Monday with capital murder of a police officer and murder for the death of the bystander. Norman, 53, worked for the Bellaire Police Department for 23 years and was the first of its officers to be shot in the line of duty, Bellaire police spokesman Robert Beran said. ‘We're devastated by his loss. We're devastated by what this has done to his family,’ Bellaire Police Chief Byron Holloway told reporters at a news conference. The identity of the bystander has not yet been released. Local observers: Sarai Rojas, center, walks with her daughters Kimberly Gonzalez, 11, and Josselyn Rojas, 5, past crime tape as police investigate the crime scene where a Bellaire police officer and a bystander were shot to death . The parking lot of the body shop remained cordoned off with yellow police tape hours after the shootings. Officers milled around, collecting evidence and discussing the incident. The owners of a nearby auto parts store closed up early for Christmas, although other stores in the strip mall remained open as people rushed in for last-minute holiday errands. Stephanie Pacheco, who works at the auto parts store, said she saw the officer get out of his patrol car in the parking lot next door and approach the driver. The officer opened the suspect's car door and tried to pull him out, she told the Houston Chronicle. That's when the suspect opened fire, she said. The officer fell down, and the suspect continued firing shots in other directions, Pacheco said. ‘This is senseless, ridiculous and needs to stop,’ Pacheco said. ‘I'm tired of seeing people die. It's a sad thing.’ The bystander was shot at close range and died at the scene, Cannon said. It wasn't clear why the man stepped outside the body shop or whether he was an employee or a customer, he added. Norman was rushed to a hospital and died there. The suspect was in critical but stable condition at a Houston hospital. Cannon said he is expected to survive.

A South Carolina couple is holding on to hope they may one day be reunited with their curly-haired adopted daughter, whose Native American biological father now has custody of the child, after the U.S. Supreme Court announced on Friday that it would hear their complex case that involves tribal law. Matt and Melanie Capobianco were overjoyed when they adopted little Veronica in September 2009 but were dealt a crushing blow when her biological father, who had never met the girl, gained custody of the child by invoking the Indian Child Welfare Act of 1978, which grants American Indian parents preference in custody disputes. The Capobianocs were forced to relinquish custody on New Year's Eve in 2011 but just one year later are hopeful that the highest court may rule in their favor and return Veronica to the parents who raised her. Innocence: After three years with her adoptive parents in South Carolina, little Veronica was given to her biological father, who had never met the girl . Happy family: Matt and Melanie Capobianco, with their adopted daughter Veronica, were in the delivery room when the child was born in Oklahoma in September 2009 . Christy, Veronica's birth mother who is not Native American, has said that she decided to give the child up for adoption after her relationship with Veronica's father, Dusten Brown, ended in April 2009 and she was pregnant with the couple's child. The couple were never married. Alone and uncertain of her future, the mother thought adoption was the best route and decided on the Capobiancos in July 2009. Matt Capobianco works as a technician at Boeing and his wife Melanie has a doctorate in developmental psychology. The pair had tried to have children of their own that included a painful journey of seven unsuccessful attempts at in vitro fertilization. The birth mother, who has supported the adoptive couple throughout the custody battle with Brown, said the father relinquished his parental rights via text message. But the birth father claims that the girl was conceived when he was engaged to the birth mother but that she broke up with him via text messages. Though he admits that he did relinquish his parental rights in exchange for not paying child support, he said that he never knew his former fiancée intended to give the child up for adoption. The adoptive couple were in the delivery room when Veronica was born on September 15, 2009 and they took the girl from Oklahoma to their home in Charleston, South Carolina. The adoption was finalized in January . 2010 but in the paperwork, the biological father was not . reportedly not identified as Native American. Though . Brown signed a legal document agreeing to put the girl up for . adoption, he attorneys later claimed that he did not have a clear . understanding of what he had signed and alleged that the birth mother . had not fully identified the child's heritage as an American Indian to . social service workers. Lawyers for the father say that the . non-Indian mother initiated an adoption outside the tribe and thus the . father has a right to pursue custody under the claims of the Cherokee . Nation. New home: Before Veronica's birth, Brown gave up his parental rights and her mother put her up for adoption . Fight: The Capobiancos have questioned whether it is right for a man - who previously showed no interest in his daughter - take her back simply because he is Native American . In July 2011, due to the National Indian Child Welfare Act, a South Carolina court ruled that Brown had a right to custody of the child, who was 22-months-old at the time. The National Indian Child Welfare . Association (NICWA) is a federal law established in 1978 to keep . American Indian children with American Indian families. The law came as a response to a high . number of children that were being taken from their communities and . placed into non Native American homes. Brown, who had never met the girl, came to South Carolina in December 2011 and took Veronica into his care. The Capobiancos have not seen her since. After a legal battle, the South Carolina Supreme Court ruled in favor of Brown in July 2012 even though the court acknowledged the adoptive couple had demonstrated they were 'ideal parents who have exhibited the ability to provide a loving family environment.' A dissenting justice called the ruling a 'human tragedy.' 'I profoundly disagree with the majority's elevation of the Indian Child Welfare Act to a position of total dominance over state law and settled principles of the best interests of the child,' South Carolina's Supreme Court Justice Kaye Hearn wrote in her opinion last summer. Missed: The couple that raised the girl since her birth in Sep. 2009 have not seen her since Dec. 2011 . Back and forth: Lawyers for Veronica's birth dad, Dusten Brown, have maintained that he is a good parent and have said the 3-year-old is happy and healthy in his care . Following the disappointing ruling in . their home state, attorneys for the couple appealed to the U.S. Supreme . Court in October 2012 and have gained supporters through their website, SaveVeronica.org, where allies can donate to help cover the legal costs. In their petition to the high court, attorneys for the adoptive parents lamented the 'bare majority of the South Carolina Supreme Court [that] ordered petitioners to surrender custody of the two-year-old daughter.' The petition adds that the application of the Indian Child Welfare Act 'has disrupted the lives of children, their parents, extended families, the adoptive parents, and others and has sent a ""chilling message"" to any couple wishing to adopt a child of Native American descent.' The Attorney General for the Cherokee . Nation Todd Hembree has said that the intent in applying the law is not . to rip a child away from a loving home. 'We want to make sure those loving home have the opportunity to be Indian homes first,' he told CNN. Hopeful: The couple are hoping that the U.S. Supreme Court will allow them to be reunited with their daughter . Heavy heart: Matt Capobianco weeps over little Veronica, who he hasn't seen since Dec. 2011 . Expectant: The adoptive parents have Veronica's room ready and waiting for her as they pray the court will rule in their favor . Lawyers . for Brown said the biological father is a good parent and have said . Veronica is 'happy, healthy and thriving' in her new living situation . with her biological father. After waiting for months and . agonizing over the separation with their child, the couple were . overjoyed when the court agreed to hear their case. 'We are going to the U.S. Supreme Court! Praise God!' they wrote on their Facebook page on Facebook, to the more than 8,000 followers of their cause. 'It has been an extremely difficult year but we now have a renewed sense of faith in our legal system,' the couple added in a statement. 'We remain hopeful that our daughter will finally be able to come home and to have a life where she can be surrounded by everyone who loves her. There is no way we could have gotten this far without the support from our family, friends and our supporters. We are beyond grateful and appreciate the continued prayers.' The Capobiancos remain in touch with the biological mother, who . supports their parental rights, but Brown has not allowed them to . contact Veronica. They told CNN that they have had one phone call with the girl since she left in December 2011 and that they told her they love her.","Matt and Melanie Capobianco have raised adoptive daughter Veronica since her birth in September 2009 .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter and Associated Press Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 19:37 EST, 27 December 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 09:01 EST, 28 December 2012 . Retired General H. Norman Schwarzkopf, who commanded the U.S.-led international coalition that drove Saddam Hussein's forces out of Kuwait in 1991, has died. The 78-year-old succumbed to complications from pneumonia on Thursday in Tampa, Florida, where he lived in retirement. His large personality and public prominence during the nation's first live-broadcast war made him the the most recognizable, and acclaimed, military commander since Dwight Eisenhower and Douglas MacArthur. A much-decorated combat soldier in Vietnam, Schwarzkopf was known popularly as 'Stormin' Norman' for his notoriously explosive temper. Scroll down for video . Decorated: General Norman Schwarzkopf was the public face of the U.S.-led coalition that invaded Iraq in 1991 . During the 1991 Persian Gulf War, he was the public face of the coalition forces who ousted Saddam Hussein's forces from Kuwait. He was also the mastermind behind the mechanics of Operations Desert Storm, co-authoring the official strategy of the defense of Saudi Arabia, as well as the combat operations in Kuwait and Iraq. After the war, his popularity was nearly immeasurable. He received the Presidential Medal of Freedom from President George H.W. Bush, was given a standing ovation by Congress and was bestowed an honorary knighthood by Queen Elizabeth II. He was offered the job of Chief of Staff - the top position in the U.S. Army - but turned it down. He retired from active duty in August 1991 - just six moths after the conclusion of the war. He lived in retirement in Tampa, where he had served in his last military assignment as commander-in-chief of U.S. Central Command. That is the headquarters responsible for U.S. military and security concerns in nearly 20 countries from the eastern Mediterranean and Africa to Pakistan. Schwarzkopf became Commander-in-Chief of 'CENTCOM' in 1988 and when Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait three years later to punish it for allegedly stealing Iraqi oil reserves, he commanded Operation Desert Storm, the coalition of some 30 countries organized by then-President George H.W. Bush that succeeded in driving the Iraqis out. At the peak of his postwar national celebrity, Schwarzkopf - a self-proclaimed political independent - rejected suggestions that he run for office, and remained far more private than other generals, although he did serve briefly as a military commentator for NBC. Author of the war: Schwarzkopf, seen here with President George H.W. Bush in Saudi Arabia in 1990, drew up the battle plans for Operation Desert Shield and Operation Desert Storm . Diplomat: Schwarzkopf, seen here with the emir of Bahrain, reached out to the leaders of several Arab countries to help build support for the U.S. operation . While focused primarily in his later years on charitable enterprises, he campaigned for President George W Bush in 2000 but was ambivalent about the 2003 invasion of Iraq, saying he doubted victory would be as easy as the White House and Pentagon predicted. In early 2003 he told the Washington Post the outcome was an unknown: . Long service: Schwarzkopf earned a reputation for bravery during the Vietnam War and was a highly-decorated officer . 'What is postwar Iraq going to look like, with the Kurds and the Sunnis and the Shiites? That's a huge question, to my mind. It really should be part of the overall campaign plan,' he said. Initially Schwarzkopf had endorsed the invasion, saying he was convinced that former Secretary of State Colin Powell had given the United Nations powerful evidence of Iraqi weapons of mass destruction. After that proved false, he said decisions to go to war should depend on what U.N. weapons inspectors found. He seldom spoke up during the conflict, but in late 2004, he sharply criticized then-Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld and the Pentagon for mistakes that included inadequate training for Army reservists sent to Iraq and for erroneous judgments about Iraq. 'In the final analysis I think we are behind schedule. ... I don't think we counted on it turning into jihad (holy war),' he said in an NBC interview. Schwarzkopf was born August 24, 1934, . in Trenton, New Jersey, where his father, Colonel H. Norman Schwarzkopf . Sr, founder and commander of the New Jersey State Police, was then . leading the investigation of the Lindbergh kidnap case, which ended with . the arrest and 1936 execution of German-born carpenter Richard . Hauptmann for stealing and murdering the famed aviator's infant son. The . elder Schwarzkopf was named Herbert, but when the son was asked what . his 'H'' stood for, he would reply, 'H.' Although reputed to be . short-tempered with aides and subordinates, he was a friendly, talkative . and even jovial figure who didn't like 'Stormin' Norman' and preferred . to be known as 'the Bear,' a sobriquet given him by troops. Activist: Schwarzkopft, seen here in 2006, largely faded from public life after his retirement from the Army. In recent years he became spokesmen for the Nature Conservancy and an initiative to fund prostate cancer research . Public face: Schwarzkopf gave numerous media briefings that aired across the country - making him a nationally-recognized name . Decorated: Schwarzkopf was honored by President George H.W. Bush, Congress, Queen Elizabeth II and the governments of nearly every coalition nation where he served . He . also was outspoken at times, including when he described Gen William . Westmoreland, the U.S. commander in Vietnam, as 'a horse's ass' in an . Associated Press interview. As a teenager Norman accompanied his father to Iran, where the elder Schwarzkopf trained the country's national police force and was an adviser to Reza Pahlavi, the young Shah of Iran. Young Norman studied there and in Switzerland, Germany and Italy, then followed in his father's footsteps to West Point, graduating in 1956 with an engineering degree. After stints in the U.S. and abroad, he earned a master's degree in engineering at the University of Southern California and later taught missile engineering at West Point. In 1966 he volunteered for Vietnam and served two tours, first as a U.S. adviser to South Vietnamese paratroops and later as a battalion commander in the U.S. Army's Americal Division. He earned three Silver Stars for valor - including one for saving troops from a minefield - plus a Bronze Star, a Purple Heart and three Distinguished Service Medals. While many career officers left . military service embittered by Vietnam, Schwarzkopf was among those who . opted to stay and help rebuild the tattered Army into a potent, . modernized all-volunteer force. After . Saddam invaded Kuwait in August 1990, Schwarzkopf played a key . diplomatic role by helping to persuade Saudi Arabia's King Fahd to allow . U.S. and other foreign troops to deploy on Saudi territory as a staging . area for the war to come. President Barack Obama: 'With the passing of Gen. Norman Schwarzkopf, we've lost an American original. From his decorated service in Vietnam to the historic liberation of Kuwait and his leadership of United States Central Command, Gen. Schwarzkopf stood tall for the country and Army he loved. Our prayers are with the Schwarzkopf family, who tonight can know that his legacy will endure in a nation that is more secure because of his patriotic service.'___Former President George H.W. Bush: 'Barbara and I mourn the loss of a true American patriot and one of the great military leaders of his generation. A distinguished member of that ""Long Gray Line"" hailing from West Point, Gen Norm Schwarzkopf, to me, epitomized the ""duty, service, country"" creed that has defended our freedom and seen this great nation through our most trying international crises. More than that, he was a good and decent man - and a dear friend. Barbara and I send our condolences to his wife, Brenda, and his wonderful family.'___Former Secretary of State Colin Powell: 'With the passing of General H. Norman Schwarzkopf, America lost a great patriot and a great soldier. Norm served his country with courage and distinction for over 35 years. The highlight of his career was the 1991 Persian Gulf War, Operation Desert Storm. ""Stormin' Norman"" led the coalition forces to victory, ejecting the Iraqi Army from Kuwait and restoring the rightful government. His leadership not only inspired his troops, but also inspired the nation. He was a good friend of mine, a close buddy. I will miss him.

"PUBLISHED: . 08:47 EST, 9 January 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 12:08 EST, 9 January 2013 . Dolls of slave characters from Quentin Tarantino's new blockbuster have caused outrage amongst civil rights activists who say they should be withdrawn from sale. The figurines represent characters from the ultra-violent film Django Unchained, which tells the story of a former slave who travels across America to find his wife and free her from slavery at the hands of a cruel plantation owner. Amazon.com was selling three, eight-inch tall plastic dolls representing the black slaves Django, Broomhilda and Stephen as part of a series of figures from the film. No longer for sale: The series of six action figures from the film are now unavailable from Amazon.com . But black community leaders in America, who are planning to picket the Golden Globe awards this Sunday, have called for them to be withdrawn from sale saying they 'trivialise the horrors of slavery'. Najee Ali, director of the Los Angeles civil rights group Project Islamic Hope, said he and other figures in the black community were 'outraged' to hear of the action figures and said they were 'a slap in the face of our ancestors'. Calling for a boycott of the products, which are no longer available on Amazon.com, he added: 'We feel that it trivializes the horrors of slavery and what African Americans experienced. 'Tarantino and Weinstein didn't have action figures for their movie Inglorious Basterds because they know the Jewish community would never allow it, and the African-American community shouldn't allow anyone to disrespect our ancestors.' Mr Ali told Mail Online this afternoon: 'We are organising a major protest and rally outside the Golden Globes Award ceremony to draw attention to the injustice and disrespect to our African ancestors.' He said he would be supported in this by the National Action Network, the New York-based civil rights organisation, the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, and several churches and other community groups. National Action Network's president in Los Angeles, the Reverend KW Tulloss said: 'Selling this doll is highly offensive to our ancestors and the African American community.' The three slave dolls are part of a series of several featuring characters from the film.  The slave dolls show Django, the freed slave played by Jamie Foxx, Broomhilda, his wife, played by Kerry Washington, and Stephen, another slave, played by Samuel L Jackson. The remaining, white, dolls include plantation owner Calvin Candie, played by Leonardo di Caprio, a bounty hunter called Schultz (Christoph Waltz), and Butch (James Remar). Controversial subject matter: Freed slave Django (Jamie Foxx, left) comes up against plantation owner Calvin Candie (Leonardo DiCaprio, right) in the film . Jamie Foxx stars as a freed slave who turns bounty hunter as he travels around America to find his wife and free her from slavery . In Django Unchained, Christoph Waltz plays Dr King Schultz, left, a bounty hunter who asks Django (played by Jamie Foxx, right) for help . They were produced by National Entertainment Collectibles Assocation (NECA) in collaboration with the Weinstein Company, the studio that produced Django Unchained. When the figures were announced, NECA Joel Weinshanker said the company was 'very excited to bring the stellar cast of Django to life and honoured to be working with another Tarantino masterpiece', according to the Daily Beast. In the company's defence, the figurines are said to be intended not as toys but as collectibles for adults rather than children. But reviewers on Amazon.com, where the dolls are no longer available to buy, have other ideas. One wrote: 'Why? Really this is some racist s***! The movie was good, but this is inexcusable.  Do the accessories include whips, chains and klan members?' Another said: 'I am in complete shock that someone would exploit the struggle of my ancestors and the entire freedom movement with such tasteless, classless, and disgusting ""action figures"". 'Shame on Amazon for even selling these.' The film has already attracted criticism for its subject matter and its liberal use of the word n*****, which is said more than 100 times. Director Spike Lee took to Twitter to express his outrage at what he perceived as offensive sujbject matter, saying: 'American Slavery Was Not A Sergio Leone Spaghetti Western. 'It Was A Holocaust. My Ancestors Are Slaves. Stolen From Africa. I Will Honor Them.' [sic] . Django Unchained opened in the US on Christmas Day after its LA premiere was cancelled due to the Sandy Hook school massacre.  It is due to open in the UK on January 18.

Authorities said on Friday they believe a casino worker killed a 10-year-girl several days before Christmas, then went to the Bellagio resort on the Las Vegas Strip and slashed the face of a co-worker with a pair of razor blades. The weeklong search for Jade Morris ended on Friday afternoon when officials confirmed that her body had been found on Thursday in an undeveloped housing tract. Police had been searching for her since Christmas Day. She died of multiple stab wounds, the Clark County coroner's office said. Suspect: Brenda Stokes Wilson, pictured in Clark County Justice Court in Las Vegas, is accused of slashing a Bellagio blackjack dealer and is suspected of kidnapping and slaying 10-year-old Jade Morris . Brenda Stokes Wilson was identified in court Friday as the prime suspect in the slaying. Jade was last seen Dec. 21 with family friend Brenda Stokes Wilson, who picked her up to go Christmas shopping. Wilson, 50, returned the car she had borrowed for the outing to a friend two hours later. Jade never came back. Investigators later found blood on the driver's door and steering wheel of the 2007 Saab sedan. Later that night, Wilson was wrestled to the ground with razors in each hand after allegedly slashing the face of a female co-worker at the Bellagio casino. A judge raised her bail to $60,000 from $600,000 on Friday morning after she was identified as the prime suspect in the child's killing. 'It's no secret the defendant is the suspect in the murder of 10-year-old Jade Morris,' prosecutor Robert Daskas told Senior Clark County District Court Judge Joseph Bonaventure at the hearing. Later Friday, Las Vegas police homicide Capt. Chris Jones said investigators were still moving forward. 'As soon as we get all the evidence in that we need, we'll book her on the murder charges,' he said. Wilson has been jailed since the 21st on felony battery with a weapon, burglary and mayhem charges that could get her decades in prison. Gruesome discovery: Police found blood inside a car borrowed by Wilson, left, which belongs to Jade Morris, 10, who was last seen when she was taken Christmas shopping by the suspect .

She's one herself, and learned Thursday how to safely use her 9 mm Ruger with a laser sight. ‘If we have the ability to stop something, we should do it,’ said the elementary school teacher, who along with nearly 200 other teachers in Utah took six hours of free gun training offered by the state's leading gun lobby. It is among the latest efforts to arm or train teachers to confront assailants after gunman Adam Lanza killed his mother and then went on a rampage through Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut, killing 20 children and six adults before killing himself.

In Ohio, a firearms group said it was launching a test program in tactical firearms training for 24 teachers. In Arizona, the attorney general is proposing a change to state law that would allow an educator in each school to carry a gun. The moves to train teachers come after the National Rifle Association proposed placing an armed officer at each of the nation's schools, though some schools already have police officers. Parents and educators have questioned how safe the proposal would keep kids and whether it would be economically feasible. Some educators say it is dangerous to allow guns on campus.

Funny moment: Baginska laughs as she is shown how to handle the 40 cal. Sig Sauer . Among the potential dangers they point to are teachers being overpowered for their weapons or students getting them and accidentally or purposely shooting classmates. ‘It's a terrible idea,’ said Carol Lear, a chief lawyer for the Utah Office of Education. ‘It's a horrible, terrible, no-good, rotten idea.’ Kristen Rand, the legislative director for the Violence Policy Center, a gun control advocacy organization, said to believe that a 'teacher would be successful in stopping someone who has made the decision to engage in a shootout is just not rationale. 'No teacher is ever going to be as . effective as a trained law enforcement officer,' Rand said. Even trained . police officers don't always hit their targets, and arming teachers . could put innocent students at risk of crossfire, she said. Big audience: 200 Utah teachers listen during the concealed weapons training class . Free training: The Utah Shooting Sports Council said it would waive its $50 fee for the concealed weapons training session for Utah teachers . Gun-rights advocates say teachers can act more quickly than law enforcement in the critical first few minutes to protect children from the kind of deadly shooting that took place in Connecticut. They emphasized the importance of reacting appropriately under pressure. ‘We're not suggesting that teachers roam the halls’ looking for an armed intruder, said Clark Aposhian, chairman of the Utah Shooting Sports Council, the state's biggest gun lobby. ‘They should lock down the classroom. But a gun is one more option if the shooter’ breaks into a classroom, he said. The group waived its $50 fee for the training. Instruction featured plastic guns and emphasized that people facing deadly threats should announce or show their gun and take cover before trying to shoot. They cautioned teachers about the liability that comes with packing a gun in public.‘It's . going to be a hassle. It's another responsibility. You can't just leave . your gun lying around,’ Aposhian said. ‘Not for a minute.’ Onlookers: Carl Stubbs, center, the principal from Valley View Elementary School, in Pleasant Grove, Utah, looks on with other teachers during the training session . New permit holder: Stephen Pratt, a third grade teacher from Alpine, Utah, is fingerprinted for a gun carry permit during the concealed weapons training session . The teachers at the basic gun training applied for a concealed-weapons permit, submitting fingerprints and a mug shot for a criminal background check. The class kicked off as an instructor in the ‘psychology of mass violence’ offered various tactics to disrupt an assailant. The first, the instructor said, was to start with the command: ‘Stop right there!’ ‘I wouldn't hesitate to shoot if the danger was immediate,’ said Fiveash, adding that her laser sight would make shooting in tight quarters safer. English teacher Kevin Leatherbarrow said he often felt threatened while working at an inner-city school in Buffalo, N.Y., where he got a license to carry a pistol. He moved less than a year ago to Utah, where he feels safer. But he said gun violence can break out anywhere. Leatherbarrow said he was highly trained in handling guns - and was taking criticism from parents who don't appreciate his views on school safety. ‘I'm in agreement not everybody should be carrying firearms in school. They're not trained. But for some parents to think we're cowboys, that frustrates me,’ he said. ‘I wish parents would understand.’ This is how: An unidentified Utah teacher is shown how to handle a handgun by instructor Clint Simon (right) In the U.S., the number of homicides at schools of children, ages 5-18, have been lower year-by-year in the 2000s than they were in the mid- to late-1990s, according to the Bureau of Justice Statistics report on school crime released in 2012. At 32 deaths, the 2006-2007 school year was the only one that reached the levels from the 1990s. The manner of death was not listed. Utah is among a few states that let people carry licensed concealed weapons into public schools without exception, the National Conference of State Legislatures says in a 2012 compendium of state gun laws. Utah educators say they would ban guns if they could, but legislators left them with no choice. State law forbids schools, districts or college campuses from imposing their own gun restrictions. Educators say they have no way of knowing how many teachers are armed. Gun-rights advocates estimate 1 per cent of Utah teachers, or 240, are licensed to carry concealed weapons. It's not known how many do so at school. ‘I never felt threatened in 14 years of teaching, but I don't think you can be too prepared,’ said Tiffany Parry, a dance teacher in the Salt Lake City suburb of Sandy who applied for Thursday for a license to carry a concealed gun. ‘I think it could come in handy.’ Self-defense training: David Burnell, CEO of OPSGEAR teaches self-defense as part of the training class .

While the U.S. stares over the 'fiscal cliff' and $536 billion in tax increases for all Americans, President Obama and the House of Representatives have been accused of acting like kindergarten students engaged in a dangerous dare of 'who goes first'. President Obama returned to Washington D.C. after cutting short his Christmas vacation and the Senate is going back into session, but the Republican ruled House is still out on recess as the deadline of January 1st looms that could damage a still fragile recovery. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner informed Congress on Wednesday that the government was on track to hit its borrowing limit on Monday and that he would take 'extraordinary measures as authorized by law' to postpone a government default. Scroll down for video . U.S. President Barack Obama walks across the South Lawn upon his return to the White House today in Washington D.C. President Obama returned to Washington under pressure to forge a year-end deal with Republicans to avoid the tax hikes and spending cuts of the fiscal cliff . Still, he added, uncertainty over the outcome of negotiations over taxes and spending made it difficult to determine how much time those measures would buy. In recent days, Obama's aides have been consulting with Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid's office, but Republicans have not been part of the discussions, suggesting much still needs to be done if a deal, even a small one, were to be struck and passed through Congress by Monday. At stake are current tax rates that expire on Dec. 31 and revert to the higher rates in place during the administration of President Bill Clinton. All in all, that means $536 billion in tax increases that would touching nearly all Americans. Moreover, the military and other federal departments would have to cut $110 billion in spending.

The fiscal cliff tax burden for married people is shown here in this graph . President Barack Obama waves as he boards Air Force One to return to Washington to deal with the looming fiscal cliff that the U.S. is staring over . But while economists have warned about the economic impact of tax hikes and spending cuts of that magnitude, both sides appear to be proceeding as if they have more than just four days left. Indeed, Congress could still act in January in time to retroactively counter the effect on most taxpayers and government agencies, but chances for a large deficit reduction package would likely be put off. House Republican leaders on Wednesday said they remain ready to negotiate, but urged the Senate to consider or amend a House-passed bill that extends all existing tax rates. In a statement, the leaders said the House would consider whatever the Senate passed. 'But the Senate first must act,' they said. Aides said any decision to bring House members back to Washington would be driven by what the Senate does. Reid's office responded shortly after, insisting that the House act on Senate legislation passed in July that would raise tax rates only on incomes above $200,000 for individuals and $250,000 for couples. Meanwhile, Obama has been pushing for a variant of that Senate bill that would include an extension of jobless aid and some surgical spending reductions to prevent the steeper and broader spending cuts from kicking in. President Barack Obama greets base visitors and personnel before boarding Air Force One to return to Washington on December 26th from Hawaii . For the Senate to act, it would require a commitment from Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell not to demand a 60-vote margin to consider the legislation on the Senate floor. McConnell's office says it's too early to make such an assessment because Obama's plan is unclear on whether extended benefits for the unemployed would be paid for with cuts in other programs or on how it would deal with an expiring estate tax, among other issues. What's more, House Speaker John Boehner would have to let the bill get to the House floor for a vote. Given the calendar, chances of accomplishing that by Dec. 31 were becoming a long shot. Amid the standoff, Geithner advised Congress on Wednesday that the administration will begin taking action to prevent the government from hitting its borrowing limit. In a letter to congressional leaders, Geithner said accounting measures could save approximately $200 billion. That could keep the government from reaching the debt limit for about two months. But if Congress and the White House don't agree on how to avoid the ""fiscal cliff,"" he said, the amount of time before the government hits its borrowing limit is more uncertain. U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner is going to unveil 'extraordinary measures' in efforts to avoid the nation triggering the debt ceiling . 'If left unresolved, the expiring tax provisions and automatic spending cuts, as well as the attendant delays in filing of tax returns, would have the effect of adding some additional time to the duration of the extraordinary measures,' he wrote. Whenever the debt ceiling hits, however, it is likely to set up yet another deadline for one more budget fight between the White House and congressional Republicans. Initially, clearing the way for a higher debt ceiling was supposed to be part of a large deal aimed at reducing deficits by more than $2 trillion over 10 years with a mix of tax increases and spending cuts, including reductions in health programs like Medicare. But chances for that bargain fizzled last week when conservatives sank Boehner's legislation to only let tax increases affect taxpayers with earnings of $1 million or more. Obama and his aides have said they would refuse to let Republicans leverage spending cuts in return for raising the debt ceiling. But Republicans say the threat of voting against an increase in the limit is one of the best ways to win deficit reduction measures. Another potential showdown is pending. A renewed clash over spending could come in late March; spending authority for much of the government expires on March 27. The U.S. Treasury Department will begin taking steps this week to delay hitting the government's $16.4 trillion borrowing limit, or else the debt limit would be hit on Dec. 31, Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner said WednesdayThe U.S. Treasury Department will begin taking steps this week to delay hitting the government's $16.4 trillion borrowing limit, or else the debt limit would be hit on Dec. 31. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner said in a letter Wednesday to congressional leaders that the department will take several accounting measures to save approximately $200 billion. The government borrows about $100 billion a month, so that typically would keep the government from reaching the limit for about two months. The move comes as President Barack . Obama and the GOP congressional leadership are locked in negotiations . over how to avoid a series of tax increases and spending cuts, known as . the 'fiscal cliff,' that are scheduled to take effect next week. Congressional . officials said Wednesday they knew of no significant strides toward a . compromise over a long Christmas weekend, and no negotiations have been . set. After conferring . on a conference call, the House Republican leadership said they remain . ready for talks, but gave no hint they intend to call lawmakers back . into session unless the Senate first passes legislation. 'The . lines of communication remain open, and we will continue to work with . our colleagues to avert the largest tax hike in American history, and to . address the underlying problem, which is spending,' the leadership said . in a statement. Obama . has sought to include an increase in the borrowing limit in the talks. But Speaker John Boehner and other Republican leaders have demanded . concessions in return. The negotiations hit a stalemate last week and . Obama and lawmakers are returning to Washington this week to resume . talks. Geithner says it is harder to predict how long the delay will last because ongoing negotiations over tax and budget policies make it hard to forecast what tax revenue and government spending will be next year. The borrowing limit is the amount of . debt the government can pile up. The government accumulates debt two . ways: It borrows money from investors by issuing Treasury bonds, and it . borrows from itself, mostly from Social Security revenue. The move comes as President Obama and the GOP are locked in negotiations over how to avoid the fiscal cliff. Obama is pictured (second right) with Geithner (far left), House Speaker John Boehner (second left) and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (right) In 2011, Congress raised the limit to nearly $16.4 trillion from $14.3 trillion. Three decades ago, the national debt was $908 billion. But Washington spent more than it took in, and the debt rose steadily — surpassing $1 trillion in 1982, then $5 trillion in 1996. It reached $10 trillion in 2008 as the financial crisis and recession dried up tax revenue and as the government spent more on unemployment benefits and other programs. In August 2011, the rating agency Standard & Poor's stunned the world by stripping the U.S. government of its prized AAA bond rating because it feared that America's dysfunctional political system couldn't deliver credible plans to reduce the federal government's debt. S&P decried American 'political brinksmanship' and concluded that 'the differences between political parties have proven to be extraordinarily difficult to bridge.' A year and a half later, the two political parties are still as deadlocked as ever. Despite S&P's warnings and the political stalemate, investors still want U.S. Treasurys. Given economic turmoil in Europe and uncertainty elsewhere, U.S. government debt and U.S. dollars look like the safest bet around. That is why the interest rate, or yield, on 10-year Treasury notes has fallen from 2.58 Aug. 5, 2011 to 1.75 percent Wednesday.","The President has returned to the Capitol from his Christmas vacation in Hawaii to deal with the looming fiscal cliff which will be triggered on Monday when the U.S. debt ceiling is hit .

'I am, thankfully, knock on wood, not only healthy, but have incredible stamina and energy,' Clinton told Barbara Walters. Clinton has a history of fainting, having experienced a brief spell in in 2005 during an appearance before a women's group in Buffalo.

Sapper Richard Walker was described as a devoted father to his daughter Lily-Faith . The mother of British soldier Richard Walker who was murdered by an Afghan army traitor has revealed he was just weeks away from being reunited with his daughter. Sapper Walker, 23, was killed in a ‘green on blue’ attack when the rogue Afghan ran amok in a fortified base in Helmand Province. His heartbroken mother, Kathryn Walker, has led tributes to the slain serviceman who was a devoted father to his young daughter Lilly-Faith. Mrs Walker, from Washington, Tyne & Wear, said: 'He had just been here the week before Christmas. 'All he had talked about was getting back from his tour and spending time with his little girl. 'We'd arranged to have Christmas a week early so we could all spend it together. 'Even then, he felt so guilty about being away from the rest of the lads over there - he was devoted to them. 'He died doing what he loved best.' The keen footballer and gym fanatic, who served with . 28 Engineer Regiment, was shot dead on Monday when the turncoat opened . fire on UK troops after a row with fellow Afghans in Patrol Base Hazrat . in the Nahr-e Seraj district of Helmand Province. He was a driver working on a construction task preparing Nato bases to be handed to Afghan forces. Six other British soldiers were . injured in Monday’s attack and were treated at the hospital in Camp . Bastion, the main allied base. Spr Walker, who would have turned 24 next month, began a six-month tour of Afghanistan in August. It was the first time the young soldier had been to the war-torn country, having taken part in tours of Canada and Kenya before. He had been due to return home next month and was looking forward to spending time with Lilly-Faith, who turns two in April. Mrs Walker said: 'Even though he loved the Army, even though he was a popular lad and had lots of friend, ultimately he was devoted to Lilly-Faith. He adored being a dad - she was his princess.' The killing has underlined the threat from so-called ‘insider attacks’ which have claimed the lives of all six UK soldiers killed on the current six-month tour of duty in Afghanistan. Spr Walker was the 24th British serviceman or woman to die in a green on blue’ incident, where allied troops are killed by the local forces they are training. The total number of UK deaths in the war is now 439. He was described as a popular, well-respected and likeable’ soldier who would ‘talk for hours on end about his love for his daughter’. Defence chiefs said that he was ‘destined to go on to greater things - his willingness to learn, unswerving sense of duty and personal motivation to pursue a successful career would have seen him progress far. A true all rounder, his loss will be felt for years to come.’ Lieutenant Colonel Chas Story, Commanding Officer, 28 Engineer Regiment, said: ‘Spr Walker was the epitome of a true Sapper. ‘He made sure that he made the most of every opportunity, both in the Army and at home; it is without doubt that he had a lot to offer and a bright future.’ British soldiers with the Afghan National Army (ANA) troops in Camp Shorabak in Helmand Province, Afghanistan. (stock image) Lieutenant Brad Southall, Support Troop Commander, 42 Field Squadron, 28 Engineer Regiment, said: ‘He was a shining star. ‘I was struck by his charisma, his devotion to duty and his immense capability; he was the older brother whom everyone looked up to.’ Sapper Matthew Cunningham, of 28 Engineer Regiment, said: ‘I knew Richie for three years and was privileged to be able to call him my best mate. ‘He was thoughtful, funny and a big character in any group he found himself amongst, but he always put others first. ‘I have so many good memories but the one that stands out the most for me was the day that he christened his daughter Lilly-Faith. ‘He was so proud of her; I remember him standing that extra inch taller and his smile beaming more than usual.’ The Taliban claimed responsibility for the attack but that was discounted by insiders who said the gunman, identified as Mohammad Qasim Faroq, had no links to the terror group. The number of ‘green on blue’ deaths increased dramatically last year, sewing deep distrust between foreign forces and the Afghan forces they are supposed to be supporting. In 2012, more than 60 Nato service personnel, and a quarter of the British troops who died in Helmand, were killed in insider attacks. Training and mentoring Afghan forces is the key plank of Nato’s exit strategy from Afghanistan. The problem threatens to undermine the handover from international forces to local troops due to be completed by the end of 2014. Prime Minister David Cameron's spokesman described Sapper Walker's death as a 'tragic incident' and sent his best wishes to Mrs Walker and her family.","Richard Walker, 23, was a devoted father to young daughter Lilly-Faith and was due to return home next month .

A New York man is being sued by his neighbors for allegedly allowing his children to take drugs and have threesomes on the roof of their luxury apartment building. Richard Kempter, 73, is accused of letting cannabis-fuelled parties take place in his one-bedroom flat when he is not around, leaving the entire Manhattan high-rise reeking of marijuana. But Mr Kempter has hit back saying that the lawsuit is racially motivated and targets his personal guests, as his children live miles away in a different state. Sue for smell: The neighbors allege that Mr Kempter, who lives on the eight floor of this building on the Upper East Side, allows his children to smoke cannabis and have sex on the roof when he is away . ‘My children are 40 years old and live in Michigan,’ the university psychology lecturer told the NY Daily News, adding that the ‘racist neighborhood’ does not approve of his black friends. Although management of the co-op owned high-rise received the lawsuit yesterday, the feud between Mr Kempter and his neighbors has been going on for years. ‘I opened my dishwasher on a clean load of dishes and the smell was overwhelming,’ a neighbor wrote to management of the Upper East Side building in January 2010, blaming ‘Richard’s stepson’. Last January another complained: ‘It is 10.45pm and my apartment smells like a party was going on… the stench of musty pot that is lingering in my closet is unbearable.’ The lawsuit also includes accusations of . ‘lewd behavior’ after a woman, named in the lawsuit as ‘Chrissy’, was . caught on CCTV going up to the roof terrace with two men after dark, . which is prohibited by co-op rules. No to smoke: Neighbours say the cannabis smoke from the 'wild parties' in Mr Kempter's one-bedroom flat has spread throughout the building into their homes - even into their dishwashers and closets . Mr Kempter, who has lived in the building for 12 years, said he was aware that there had been complaints regarding his guests ‘getting rowdy’, and admitted that his friends ‘probably did have sex’ on the roof, but that the issues have already been resolved. The board of the co-op building had voted for him to be kicked out of the flat in march, but after Mr Kempter promised that the wild parties would stop he was allowed to stay. ‘I think there’s a racial issue here,’ he told the paper, adding that his friends named in the suit are all African-American. ‘This is a very racist neighborhood.’ The co-op is seeking $15,000 in damages, plus payment from Kempter for their legal bills.","Neighbours sue over 'rowdy cannabis parties' in Upper East Side flat .

A couple accused of torturing and killing a pensioner took a taxi back to the scene of the crime to steal valuables and empty his freezer, a court has heard. Mother-of-four Kelly Louise Barnes, 32, and Jodie Barnes, formerly Ramsbottom, 31, are accused of targeting retired bus conductor Barry Reeve, believing he had large sums of cash. Mr Reeve, 67, remained alive for up to 48 hours after being punched, stamped on and cut with a knife in an alleged attempt to force him to disclose his Pin. His body was found in his home two weeks later. In the dock: Kelly Barnes, left, and Jodie . Barnes, right, are accused of targeting Barry Reeve, 67, at his home in . Norwich, believing he had a secret stash of money . The women, who are in a civil partnership, deny murdering him, at Norwich Crown Court. Today taxi driver Niall Gallagher said he collected the pair shortly after 8.30pm on February 9 last year, the day of Mr Reeve's murder. He said they claimed they had been kicked out of their home as they had fallen out with an 'alcoholic guy'. When they arrived at the terraced bungalow in Corton Road, Norwich, first Jodie Barnes then Kelly scaled the back gate and began piling up bin bags they had carried out of the property, the court heard. Mr Gallagher added: 'It seemed like a rush job, it was not carefully done. 'One of the bags had leaking medicine in it, another contained a large camcorder. Tortured: A court heard Barry Reeve, 67, was beaten, cut and left to slowly die at his house in Norwich . 'There was food, some of it was frozen.' He added he took the couple to a cash machine at Sainsbury's where they tried to withdraw money. Prosecutor Karim Khalil QC earlier told the court that the women made failed attempts to withdraw money using Mr Reeve's card. Mr Gallagher then drove to the Barnes' home in Bixley Close, Norwich, where they unloaded the bags and he saw food spilling from some of them. 'It wasn't normal, I didn't feel comfortable,' he said. He contacted police to report his concerns after seeing reports that Mr Reeve's body had been discovered on February 26. Opening the case, Mr Khalil said that the drug addict couple left Mr Reeve dying before returning to his flat. Targeted at home: Corton Road in Norwich where retired bus conductor Mr Reeve, known as Titch, lived . A post-mortem examination showed he was alive for at least 15 hours and up to 48 hours after the attack, meaning he was still alive when they returned. Mr Khalil said: 'He was brutally beaten, cut with a sharp blade and left to die in his home, unable to summon help.' 'It is a sad fact that he was not found until two weeks later when his daughter, Julie Reeve, called round' 'She found the back door unlocked, . opened it and saw blood on the inner door. She could not bear to go in . any further and called on a neighbour. 'Together they went back, called for him but got no answer and decided to call the emergency services.' Kelly Louise Barnes and Jodie Barnes, both of Bixley Close, Norwich, who were in a civil partnership together, deny murder. Accused: It is alleged that Kelly Barnes, right, and Jodie Barnes, left, beat Mr Reeve and cut him with a knife before leaving him dying . A post-mortem examination showed that Mr Reeve was alive for between 15 and 48 hours after suffering brain injuries. Mr Khalil said the couple had injured him in 'varied and awful ways’. He . said: 'His injuries reveal that whilst he was still alive he was beaten . savagely and that he was scored with a sharp blade to his face and . torso in a manner akin to torture.

A sample of a two-year-old boy's hair showed traces of cocaine, heroin and methadone, likely to have been ingested by the toddler in the last four months of his life, a court has heard. The tests were done on a sample of Riley Pettipierre's hair after he died from allegedly drinking his mother's methadone. His parents Sally Dent, 33, and Shaun Binfield, 45, from Belper, Derby, both deny the manslaughter of their son as well as cruelty to a person under 16. A sample of hair belonging to Riley Pettipierre who died in hospital . last March after drinking methadone from a child's beaker showed traces of cocaine, methadone, and heroin, Nottingham Crown Court heard . A tribute to Riley Pettipierre, 2, who died soon after paramedics were called to the flat he lived in with his parents Sally Dent, 33, and Shaun Binfield, 45, from Belper, Derby . Consultant forensic toxicologist Julie Evans told the trial at Nottingham Crown Court that quantities of heroin, methadone and cocaine were found in a hair sample that represented a minimum of the last four months of the child's life. She said the amounts revealed by the tests indicated the drugs had been through the boy's body rather than deposited on his hair. She said she could not say by what means the drugs had got into the child's body. Simon Clarke, for Dent, proposed that Riley had ingested the drugs by putting contaminated items in his mouth, as well as through close contact with his mother. Mr Clarke said: 'Sally Dent was in the habit of smoking her crack cocaine and heroin in her kitchen, with the door and window closed.' Mrs Evans accepted that residue from the drugs would have landed on surfaces, including cupboard handles and crockery, as well as on Dent. Parents: Shaun Binfield (left) and Sally Dent (right) outside Nottingham Crown Court, where the pair denied the manslaughter of two-year-old Riley Pettipierre and cruelty to a person under the age of 16 . She said the mechanism described by Mr Clarke could give 'measurable amounts' in the hair but, in her opinion, not the levels that were detected in Riley's case. She said: 'Theoretically, that is possible. It would require a high degree of contamination of the home environment.' She said that the residue could have been removed by washing the surface. She also told the court that the amounts of drugs ingested, indicated by the levels of the substances in his hair, would have been 'capable of causing a reaction within the body'. Mrs Evans said that the cocaine, a stimulant, could have caused the boy's heart rate to increase, as well as cause vomiting and diarrhoea, whereas the heroin and methadone were depressants and could have slowed the toddler's heart and breathing rates. Previously, the jury was told that Dent was on a methadone treatment programme. It is alleged that Riley drank some methadone that Dent had poured into a child's beaker, intended for her own use, and put on top of a chest of drawers. Opening her prosecution case, Yvonne Coen QC told a jury at Nottingham Crown Court that Dent, who repeatedly dabbed her eyes with a tissue in the dock, was struggling to get over a heroin habit. Riley Pettipierre, 2, died soon after paramedics were called to the flat above a disused shop . Dent has a history of drug use going back many years and is being prescribed methadone to try to rid her of the habit, Ms Coen told the court. A child's beaker with methadone was left on a set of drawers in his parents’ bedroom where he also slept, so it would be ‘within easy reach’ of his mother, Ms Coen alleged. Dent awoke to find Riley unconscious in bed next to her and called 999 on March 13 last year. She described her son to police as ‘a gorgeous little boy’ and a ‘loveable rogue who got up to the usual mischief’, the court heard. ‘Not only would (the beaker) have attracted him to it like a little bee to a honeypot but it was also within easy reach of him,’ she said. It was ‘grave negligence’ by his parents to leave the dangerous drug in a beaker, which the toddler would have thought was juice, the prosecutor told the court. Paramedics arrived to find Riley lifeless. His heart had stopped beating and his lips were blue, Ms Coen told the court. The toddler was taken to hospital but pronounced dead shortly after arriving. Friends and family of the couple wept in the dock as Ms Coen told the jury that post-mortem tests showed that Riley had enough methadone in his blood, stomach and urine to prove fatal. Sadness: Mourners leave flowers outside a disused shop below the flat where Riley Pettipierre died last March . He is believed to have consumed between 10ml and 20ml of methadone, the court heard. The couple originally told officers that Riley must have climbed on top of a wardrobe in the bedroom where the methadone was usually stored in a locked wooden box, Ms Coen told the court. She claims that Binfield, who was watching television in the other room on the morning of the incident, let Riley go back into the bedroom unsupervised, knowing that methadone was within his reach and knowing that Dent was sleeping off drugs she had taken the night before.

Heavy security: The suspects accused of the gang . rape and murder of the woman arrive at Saket District Court in . New Delhi for a preliminary hearing on Monday . Mr Sharma went on to blame the 23-year-old's male friend, named as Awindra . Pandey, 28, who was also attacked while travelling on a bus after the pair had been to the cinema together. He said Mr Pandey was 'wholly responsible' for the incident as the unmarried couple should not have been on the streets at night. He told Bloomberg that his three clients will plead not guilty to all charges when they make their next court appearance. The news comes after the father of the murdered woman has described her desperate battle for life - and his futile hope that she would live. He said that although he knew his daughter was 'in a bad state' after she was attacked by six men in Delhi last month, he still believed she might recover after she was taken to hospital in Singapore. But the 23-year-old physiotherapy student was to die after sustaining horrific injuries during the assault. Speaking to ITV1's Daybreak, the grieving father said: 'When we went to Singapore she was not conscious but she had tears in her eyes. Then I realised she was in a really bad state. 'I couldn’t think what to do at that time, I was like a bird without wings, I was neither here nor there. 'So . when I thought she might get better, I used to get filled with some . hope. When I was told that she might not get well and might have to have . an operation I felt uncomfortable. 'It . was difficult for me, but when she was put on a ventilator it gave me . some hope that she would get better. I thought she might get better and . she would live.' Protest: The student's death sparked outrage in India with many taking to the New Delhi streets to demand better protection for women . The father said that his daughter's death 13 days after the horrific attack has . 'brought an awakening' to Indian society and called for his country to . no longer turn a blind eye to attacks on women. He added that he would like to see a new law or a hospital named after his daughter. Describing . his daughter, he said: 'When she was born my aunties and uncles . always used to carry her around, those were really lovely days. 'Right . from the start her ambition was to be a doctor. Her main aim was that . our family wouldn’t have to suffer any more, she wanted to put the . difficult life behind us, wipe out our poverty. 'She also wanted to make sure I didn’t have to keep working hard late in life.' The young student was attacked on an illegal bus in Delhi on December 16 and she and a male friend were left for dead on the road. She eventually died in a hospital in Singapore after having 90 per cent of her intestines removed. Her death sparked furious anger across India. Anger: Protestors had given the victim the name Damini after a Bollywood . film of the same name where the protagonist fought for justice after a . rape ordeal. Outrage: Protestors hold candles in New Delhi last month as they took to the streets in anger following the 23-year-old students gang-rape and murder . Lawyers said yesterday that three of the men accused of raping and murdering the 23-year-old student are to plead not guilty. Manohar .

All five men accused of the crime will appear at a closed court next week with the case expected to be fast-tracked to trial. Mr . Sharma said that he would contest Indian police's handling of evidence . after prosecutors claimed to have forensic evidence which links the men . to the attack. A 17-year-old who is also accused of the woman's rape and murder will appear at a youth court separately. Meanwhile, . the victim's companion on the night of the attack, 28-year-old software . engineer Awindra Pandey, has spoken out about the terrible ordeal and his friend's horrific injuries. He . told The Times that his efforts to flag down help from passing . motorists after the pair had been dumped in the road were ignored for 20 . minutes. Mr Pandey said that police were reluctant to help his friend despite her injuries. 'She was asking for water and complaining of pain in her stomach,' he said. 'She was bleeding heavily. They (the police) asked me to put her in the van.' He said that the pair, who were not dating, had been to a cinema in the city to see Life of Pi but were unable to persuade a rickshaw driver to take them all the way back to the Dwarka suburb where the woman lived with her parents. They were dropped halfway home, when a phone call from her mother asking her to hurry home prompted them to board an illegal bus with blacked-out windows. Mr Pandey confronted other passengers when they began insulting the pair but they soon produced iron rods, he said. He said that he was beaten and fell to the floor of the bus. After up to 20 minutes, the gang believed the student to have died and dumped the pair in the road.","Manohar Lal Sharma said woman's male friend was 'wholly responsible'

Handful: Wildlife ranger Steve Coulson takes hold of baby snakes which were found in the childcare centre . A childcare centre had to be closed after a family of pythons was discovered behind a wall in a room where toddlers take their afternoon nap. The nest of 23 baby pythons and their 8ft long mother was discovered in the nursery, in Darwin, in Australia's remote Northern Territory, as a partition wall was torn down. The search began after one of the baby snakes stuck its head out of the wall at the Mitchell Street Childcare Centre. A wildlife ranger was quickly called by terrified staff as they made the shocking discovery. Director of the centre Louise DeBomford said 41 egg shells were also discovered, but it was believed a few of the babies escaped. She said: 'After a bit more of the wall was torn down, we found the mother - she was two-and-a-half metres long. So it was quite a shock to everyone.' Ms DeBomford said the mother was reluctant to leave her babies: . She said: 'They were feisty and not too happy to leave their warm nest. 'There was a baby snake in the room yesterday morning - I thought there would have to be more than one because we had an inundation of snakes last year, about the same time. 'Then we had about 14 of them, so they must like our building.' On that occasion, the snakes fell down through the ceiling and a nest was discovered in the roof. The centre had to be closed as wildlife range Steve Coulson was called in to remove the snakes. He said: 'The eggs were the size of plums, and were in clumps like grapes. 'The babies went in one sack, while a bigger sack had to be fetched for the python mum.' Snake eyes: The baby pythons were discovered after one poked its head out of the wall . Slippery customer: Stephannie Dean of Larrakeyah and her two sons Carlos and Benji have a look at the snake found behind the wall .
