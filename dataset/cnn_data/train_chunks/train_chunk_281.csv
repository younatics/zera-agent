"Washington (CNN) -- Beginning Saturday and continuing over the next few weeks, some of the nation's most prominent governors will be leaving office as a new crop of state chief executives are sworn in. Among the more well-known governors who will be leaving office: . -- Republicans Arnold Schwarzenegger of California, Charlie Crist of Florida, Tim Pawlenty of Minnesota and Mark Sanford of South Carolina . -- Democrats Bill Richardson of New Mexico, David Paterson of New York, Ed Rendell of Pennsylvania, Ted Strickland of Ohio and Jennifer Granholm of Michigan . Some of them are leaving due to term limits, some were defeated and others sought different offices. Some are leaving after having survived high-profile scandals. Others are departing after weathering a myriad of problems affecting their states. David Paterson, Jennifer Granholm and Bill Richardson will be the first to leave office when their successors are sworn in on Saturday. Richardson told CNN he is going to stay in Santa Fe, New Mexico, and looks forward to becoming a private citizen after having served as a governor, a cabinet secretary, a United Nations ambassador and a congressman. ""I'm going to try to set up a foreign policy institute where I continue my work on peacemaking, on rescuing hostages, on U.S.-Latin American relations. I'm going to stay active,"" Richardson told CNN's ""John King USA"" program on Thursday. ""I'm going to be around -- not in New Mexico politics but more at a national and hopefully international level. But you know I need a pause, the people in New Mexico need a pause from me, probably the country needs a pause from me."" Having just returned from a trip to North Korea to help calm recent tensions, Richardson said he intends to stay involved in that issue and other foreign policy matters but doesn't rule out returning to Washington one day. Schwarzenegger's last day in office is next Monday. It has been a roller coaster for the actor turned politician. After first winning office following the recall of his predecessor, Gray Davis, in 2003, he promised a new approach. While his supporters point to major environmental and political reforms in the state, his popularity plummeted as the state's fiscal problems mounted. California confronted major deficits and financial headaches as Schwarzenegger and legislators faced off trying to find solutions to deal with the red ink. In an interview in November on NBC's ""Tonight Show,"" Schwarzenegger said he did not have regrets about his decision to run. ""It was one of the greatest decisions I ever made because working for the people of California is really was a great pleasure for me, it was a great honor. It was very rewarding to make some of the decisions that had to be made, and we really moved the state forward,"" he told host Jay Leno. While detractors such as some of the state's labor unions have criticized some of the decisions he has made, Schwarzenegger pointed to some of his accomplishments. ""I am very happy I became the reform governor, that we reformed workers compensation, that we reformed the primary -- open primaries so that we bring both of the parties closer together,"" he said. ""I am very happy we took the power away from the legislators and from the lawmakers, the power to draw the district lines...also all of the environmental laws,"" such as ones to reduce greenhouse gases and to encourage alternative energy sources. But he also acknowledged some of the financial problems facing the Golden State with declarations of fiscal emergencies and several rounds of major spending cuts to popular programs. ""I have to say that I am sad that we had a second in my term, a second decline economically, because no matter how much I brag about what we have accomplished it is horrible when you see so many people unemployed. Suddenly people losing their jobs. So many people suffering."" On Monday, former governor Jerry Brown, a Democrat, will once again take the helm of the state as it faces a growing budget gap. It is now estimated its deficit will be $28 billion over the next 18 months. Even before taking office, Brown has been meeting with state officials and legislators to help find ways of dealing with it. The most scandal-ridden governor to be leaving office now is South Carolina's Mark Sanford, whose fiscal conservative credentials were helping to propel his career. However, last year he admitted lying to his staff when he told them he had gone on a hiking trip on the Appalachian Trail. Instead, it turned into a political crisis. Before a painful press conference at the state capitol, he went into detail about how he had ventured to Argentina for a rendezvous with a mistress. Eventually his wife, Jenny, divorced him. Despite calls for his resignation and impeachment inquiries, Sanford persisted and stayed in office. Before Sanford's last day on January 12, he is scheduled to tour parts of the state to extend thanks to his supporters. In an interview with CNN affiliate WCBD in Charleston, Sanford said one of the things he was most proud in his eight years as governor was bringing some fiscal discipline to the state. One incident of his gubernatorial career will certainly stand out: in 2004 he brought some live pigs into the state house after some of his budget vetoes were overturned, to protest what he considered pork barrel spending. He eventually got his way. ""It went to the core of whether we have a balanced budget requirement in the state,"" he said. He told the station in the time since his affair became public it has been a time of some accomplishment for the state. ""If you look at these last 18 months they have been surprisingly productive,"" he said, pointing to some vetoes of bills amounting to savings of about $260 million. Sanford will be succeeded by Republican state legislator Nikki Haley, a rising star in the GOP.","Some of the nation's most prominent governors are wrapping up their terms .

"(CNN) -- Old habits die hard. Oregon Gov. John Kitzhaber will tell you that. The former emergency room doctor was on his way to dinner Monday evening when he noticed a woman in need of help in downtown Portland. So, of course, he did what any trained physician would. He ordered his driver to stop. And using medical equipment he had in his car, he performed CPR until the paramedics arrived. The woman had ""apparently overdosed"" on heroin, the governor's spokeswoman Nkenge Harmon Johnson said. She was taken to a local hospital, but her condition wasn't immediately known. Not the first time . Monday's incident wasn't the first time Kitzhaber has put his medical training to use, long after leaving the ER scrubs behind. During a gubernatorial debate in 2010, someone in the audience suffered a heart seizure. The debate was interrupted for about 20 minutes as Kitzhaber rushed down the aisle and tended to the man -- making sure his airways were clear and he was breathing -- until medics arrived. In 2005, Kitzhaber ran after an intruder and trapped him in a revolving door. Going for the record books . The Democratic governor was first elected in 1994 and re-elected four years later. After eight years out of office, Kitzhaber won election in 2010 to a historic third term as Oregon governor. In December, he announced that he'll run for re-election this year -- for an unprecedented fourth term as Oregon governor. Oregon limits governors to two consecutive terms in office. But there are no limits on the number of total terms. When a baby stops breathing, Florida motorists pitch in to help .

"London (CNN) -- Apps -- those bite-sized portals to mass information and services -- have not only revolutionized the way we communicate, but also how we travel and how we maximize our time on the road. Tom Dunmore, creative director at Mediablaze, which runs app-review website ""Life of Android,"" says because apps are location sensitive, easy to use and constantly connected, they are ""the next stage of the internet."" ""Increasingly, we'll see people rely on apps in the way they previously relied on maps, guide books and indeed personal assistants, booking flights and hotels -- all those things suddenly merged down into a mobile phone,"" he says. This efficient experience is driving the growth of travel apps, where all sectors of the industry are responding to our appetite for arranging our travel online -- digital DIY. See also: Budget airlines go long haul . Paul English, co-founder of travel website Kayak, admits that he was wrong about the initial reasons for developing an app version of the site. ""I had this thought that the reason people are going to be using Kayak on a mobile would be -- they'd be in New York, they'd get drunk, or a meeting ran late, they'd miss their flight home and they needed to get a last-minute hotel in the city,"" says English. ""I had our head of engineering run a report for showing how many days out people start searching Kayak on their mobile phone compared to on the website -- what shocked me was the data was almost exactly the same,"" he adds. ""Having real-time information about what's happening with their travel has made people feel powerful."" It became obvious to English that people think of their mobile phone as their computer, where they demand full functionality of websites on the move to plan itineraries for themselves. With over 12 million downloads since 2009, Kayak now dedicates 20% of its engineering team to app development, working on key searches for travelers, who can also integrate their itinerary with calendars to share with friends and colleagues. ""It's really changed us as a company, in the way we think,"" says English. ""We take guidance from what's going on with the app and adapt the website, not the other way around. It's also helped raise awareness of the company."" See also: Ayesha's travel essentials . It's not just the travel industry that realizes the value of apps. A study by Forrester Research forecasts that companies will spend up to $17 billion over the next four years creating apps for their products. Revenue from selling these apps could reach $38 billion by 2015. A report published by Deloitte in January found that the value of the app economy in the UK alone is $700 million (â‚¬522.5m), creating more than 7,000 jobs. Among the UK's app developers is Realmac Software. It's app ""Clear"" has struck a chord with people's need for order. The digital ""to-do list"" became a huge seller after it launched in February 2012. Costing $1 on several app stores, including Apple's, so far more than half a million copies of Clear have been sold. ""We've definitely raised the bar in terms the amount of touch gestures you use in an app -- pinch, slide, expand -- we've taken it to a whole new level"" says Nik Fletcher, product manager at Realmac, which was established 10 years ago. ""Pretty much anyone can sign up to be an app developer,"" says Fletcher. ""You pay $99 a year, paid to Apple, and that basically gives you access to all the developer resources they provide and allows you to submit your apps for their consideration on the app store. ""Once your app has been approved by Apple, it's on sale pretty much to any app store in the world. The barrier is so much lower now. A single person can start building an app and publish it and they're in the same league as all these major brands. You don't need the backing of a big brand to be successful.""","Apps are increasingly being used to plan travel on the go .

"Paterson, New Jersey (CNN) -- President Barack Obama reviewed damage inflicted by Hurricane Irene in northern New Jersey on Sunday, promising residents, ""We'll be there to help."" Obama visited the towns of Paterson and Wayne, where residents showed the high-water marks from the flooding spawned by last week's hurricane. The Passaic River and one of its tributaries, the Pompton, overflowed their banks through the area after Irene dumped heavy rains across the Northeast. ""I know it's a tough time right now,"" Obama told people whose homes had flooded in Wayne, on the banks of the Pompton. ""You guys hang in there. We're going to do everything we can to help."" Irene inflicted at least $1 billion in wind damage alone from North Carolina to New England, according to federal government estimates. Private-sector analysts have put the total expected losses as high as $6 billion. Get the latest news on Tropical Storm Lee . The federal government's tab for the storm could exhaust the $800 million left in the Federal Emergency Management Agency's disaster relief fund before the fiscal year ends September 30. Some conservative House Republicans, led by Rep. Eric Cantor, R-Virginia, have called for spending cuts to offset any increase in emergency funds. But Obama told reporters Sunday that he would not let ""Washington politics"" affect recovery efforts. ""We're going to make sure resources are here,"" he said. Irene dumped torrential rain across the Eastern Seaboard from Florida to Vermont, where more flooding cut off small towns in the New England hills. A total of 43 people died in the storm, which hit North Carolina's Outer Banks as a hurricane with 85 mph winds, bounced off the Jersey Shore as a minimal hurricane and finally came ashore as a tropical storm over the city of New York. About 1,700 people in the Wayne, Paterson, Little Falls, Totowa and Woodland Park areas were forced to evacuate when the Passaic and other nearby waterways flooded. Some of the people Obama met had dragged their waterlogged belongings out to the curb. During Sunday's visit, Obama hugged several people, including one woman who was overcome with tears, and at one point he theatrically rummaged through his pockets for change. ""I know it could have been worse, but we should not underestimate the heartache that's going through these communities and affecting a lot of these families,"" the president said. Obama viewed the Passaic, which had crested Tuesday at seven feet over its flood stage, from a bridge in downtown Paterson and visited a relief center set up in the parking lot of a home-improvement store. About 600 utility customers remained without power in the Paterson area, out of about 6,600 remaining outages statewide. The president was accompanied by various officials, including New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, a Republican, and the state's two Democratic U.S. senators, Frank Lautenberg and Robert Menendez. FEMA Director Craig Fugate and the agency's coordinating officer, Bill Vogel, also appeared with the president.

"Albany, Oregon (CNN) -- The Oregon teen accused of planning to bomb his high school had a detailed itinerary for his attack that included napalm bombs, firearms and killing himself before the police could, authorities said Tuesday. According to a three-page probable cause affidavit released by authorities, an investigator wrote that police found notebooks and other documents in 17-year-old Grant Acord's room. They contained handwritten and typed plans, including diagrams, to commit mass murder, the affidavit said. In one of the plans, Acord wrote that he wanted to go to first period then take a few hours in the parking lot to prepare for his attack, during which he would ""shoot and throw bombs throughout the school."" On Tuesday, the teen appeared in court via a video feed from jail. It was the initial hearing for a gawky teenager accused of plotting a monstrous crime. He sat awkwardly in a folding chair, shoulders slumped. When the judge entered, Acord snapped to attention in front of a microphone. Unsure of where to position himself, he answered the judge's questions in calm, respectful, short answers. It was a surreal juxtaposition to see the face and demeanor of a young man who authorities say modeled his plan on the 1999 massacre at Colorado's Columbine High School. Acord's timeline -- which police say he entitled ""The (Loosely Stated) Plan AKA Worst case Scenario"" -- would have begun at 7:30 a.m. and would have ended with an attack just after 11:10. The writing said he planned to pack his truck with the bombs and guns at home, go to West Albany High School and slip out of class after first period. Then he would have waited until 10 a.m. where he would have moved to ""smoke spot"" to ""gear up."" After that, he planned to move to another parking lot, check for a school resource officer, and if none was there, he would back in the truck at 11:10 a.m. into a spot near one of the exits he had staked out. His harrowing plan continued: ""Get gear out of trunk. Carry duffle in one hand, napalm firebomb in the other, walk towards school with (Airport Stalk music from the Call of Duty video game) blasting out of car. Drop duffle. Light and throw napalm, unzip bag and begin firing. Cooly state: 'The Russian grim reaper is here.' If 3rd exit is blocked by napalm fire, or is locked, run to 1st entrance."" The plan ends with a suicide. ""Kill myself before S.W.A.T. engages me,"" he writes. He was charged as an adult with attempted aggravated murder and 18 other charges related to making and possessing a destructive device. Acord, who said little throughout the proceeding, did not enter a plea. A judge set bond at $2 million. Authorities are still not saying when Acord wanted to launch his plan. The affidavit suggests he still had a fair amount of planning to do, including purchasing a Hi-Point 995 rifle and a Mossberg shotgun, and building several more bombs. Officials at the school and police said a fellow student's tip led to Acord's arrest. Family attorney: 'He's very mentally ill' Acord's mother says her son suffers from a rare form of obsessive-compulsive disorder. ""My heart goes out to everyone affected by Grant's struggle with PANDAS, a rare form of OCD,"" Grant Acord's mother said through her attorney. ""I grieve for my son but understand and support the efforts of law enforcement to keep our beloved community safe,"" his mother, Marianne Fox, added. ""This is a challenging and confusing time for everyone who knows Grant. I will have no further comment while I wait with the rest of you to see what unfolds."" Acord's goal, said Benton County District Attorney John Haroldson on Monday, ""was to model the Columbine shootings with some adjustments that would make it a greater success."" PANDAS, which stands for pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorder associated with streptococcus, is caused by the body's immune reaction to a strep infection, not the infection itself, according to the International OCD Foundation. Dr. Rosario Trifiletti, a New Jersey-based child neurologist and expert on PANDAS, notes there is a similar but broader diagnosis called PANS, or pediatric acute-onset neuropsychiatric syndrome, that affects 1% to 2% of children and can result in ""explosive violence"" among sufferers. Trifiletti, who emphasized he cannot comment on Acord's case because he hasn't treated him, said he has seen youngsters with PANS become deeply fearful and violent with their parents. ""I think the thing that shocks parents is how quickly they change. They can snap,"" he said. In his research, however, he has never seen any sufferer premeditate violence in the manner outlined in the allegations against Acord. ""There has not been a kid who has done anything close to this,"" the doctor said. There are no clear diagnostic criteria for PANDAS, according to the PANDAS Network, which says the disorder is marked by a rapid onset and intensification of obsessive-compulsive behaviors. Among those, according to the National Institutes of Health, are ""obsessive thoughts, compulsive behaviors and motor or vocal tics."" Those symptoms can be accompanied by anxiety attacks, irritability, extreme mood swings, temper tantrums, immaturity, hyperactivity, handwriting changes and problems in school, the NIH says. As for PANS, the peer-reviewed journal Pediatrics & Therapeutics cites several categories of ""neuropsychiatric symptoms"" that can accompany the disorder: anxiety; emotional changes and/or depression; irritability, aggression and/or severely oppositional behaviors; behavioral regression; a drop in school performance; sensory or motor abnormalities; and bodily symptoms such as sleep disturbances and problems with urination. Alan Lanker, the attorney for the mother, said Acord has received treatment, but he did not know the details of the teen's treatment. ""He's very mentally ill. He has PANDAS. It's a brain infection that's causing a mental illness. It's been their concern for some time,"" Lanker said. Disturbing allegations . Police found six types of explosives after they arrested Acord on Thursday night at a home in Albany, Oregon, Haroldson said. They recovered napalm, pipe and drain cleaner bombs, as well as Molotov cocktails Friday from ""a secret compartment that had been created in the floorboards"" of the teen's bedroom, Haroldson said. The prosecutor said Acord wanted to outdo the Columbine High School shootings, which left one teacher and 14 students dead, including the two gunmen.

"Shanghai, China (CNN) -- In between sipping drinks and reminiscing about bygone times at a recent reunion of my high school class, old friends curious about foreign news media's coverage on China asked what stories I was working on. When I mentioned the 25th anniversary of the Tiananmen Square crackdown -- which killed hundreds, perhaps thousands, of people -- as a major topic of interest in the coming days, the reaction was almost always surprise followed by indifference. ""Really? Who still cares about that?"" Most of my former classmates who graduated from an elite Shanghai high school in 1994 are established both professionally and personally. Now in their late 30s, they are doctors, bankers, engineers and businessmen living comfortably and raising their young children in China's largest city. TIMELINE: The Tiananmen Square crackdown . When nudged, some classmates recalled the excitement we all felt as fresh-faced 8th graders witnessing history unfolding in front of our eyes back in 1989. Mass demonstrations started in Beijing in April that year as university students gathered in Tiananmen Square to mourn the death of an ousted liberal Communist Party leader. By mid-May, the movement had become a nationwide phenomenon as people -- students, workers and intellectuals, united by their grievances against inflation and corruption -- took to the streets to demand political reform. Our high school sits on a busy commercial street linking the city center and a university district in Shanghai. Almost every day that late spring, from our third-floor classroom, we could hear the chanting and cheering as demonstrators marched past our campus. 'Freedom' We would rush downstairs or to the windows during breaks to watch the demonstrations. A sea of red flags and banners was a memorable scene of people power for those of us born after Chairman Mao's Cultural Revolution. It was also thrilling to hear shouts of ""democracy"" and ""freedom"" reverberating in the air, as those words had largely been taught as phony Western concepts in political science classes. In the end our political science teacher turned out to be right after all. Every time when she sensed our diverted attention, she would remind us to focus on our textbook instead of the protests outside: ""This will be over shortly and nothing good will come of it."" A few weeks later on June 4, soldiers in Beijing opened fire on civilians to clear Tiananmen Square of protesters. Several days after that, Shanghai authorities removed roadblocks set up by local demonstrators to disrupt traffic in protest at the brutal military suppression in the capital. When the dust settled and a new Communist leadership was installed in Beijing, the same political science teacher returned to give us the Party's version of the events. ""Counter-revolutionary riot,"" was the official verdict on the pro-democracy movement she wrote on the blackboard, emphasizing that the lesson was mandatory and a test would be given. Tank man . We were required to watch a video produced by state broadcaster CCTV, which contained the iconic image of the ""tank man"" -- an unknown protester standing in front of a column of tanks to stop their advancement. GALLERY: Behind the 'tank man' image . ""He was like a mantis trying to obstruct a chariot."" I still remember this Chinese idiom used by the announcer. ""If not for the restraint of our military, he would have been obliterated."" Along with political indoctrination, other aspects of life seemed to have returned to normal rather quickly -- at least in the eyes of teenagers. By the time I left China for the United States in 1993, the Tiananmen protests had become a distant memory in my mind thanks to the government's strenuous effort to erase the events from national consciousness shortly after the bloody crackdown. While I later found out more about what happened in 1989 and to those involved in the movement by reading eyewitness accounts, foreign news reports and academic papers, most of my former classmates staying behind in China did not enjoy such access. What they -- and the generations after them -- have enjoyed are the fruits of China's breakneck economic development that started in the early 1990s. ""The Communist Party was forced to strike a deal with the Chinese people in 1992,"" said Wu'erkaixi, a student leader of the pro-democracy movement who fled China after the military suppression and has lived in exile ever since. ""The Party gave them the right to make money in exchange for political cooperation -- the deal worked."" The Taipei-based activist, who remains the second most wanted man in China for his role in the Tiananmen protests, says he is not surprised by the Chinese leadership's continued refusal to re-assess the movement, even though its official description has been watered down to ""political disturbance between the spring and summer of 1989."" ""The new ruling elite post-1989 has been a mixture of princelings and technocrats,"" he said, referring to descendants of Mao's peers and officials with a technical background. ""They have formed an alliance to write laws that benefit them and protect their entrenched interests above anything else -- so they have little tolerance to any challenge to the status quo."" Annual crackdown . Every year around June 4, the Chinese government rounds up political dissidents, human rights advocates and families of the crackdown victims to prevent them from gathering or speaking to mark the occasion. Under the leadership of President Xi Jinping, himself a princeling, the authorities struck earlier and harder this year, detaining activists -- including prominent lawyer Pu Zhiqiang -- for attending on low-key seminar on the Tiananmen protests. Veteran journalist Gao Yu, another well-known voice on the topic, was taken into custody for allegedly leaking state secrets even before the meeting. Leading human rights activist Hu Jia, who is organizing an online campaign to commemorate the 1989 movement, has been under house arrest since late February. Tiananmen Square, a major tourist attraction, remains off limits to foreign news outlets, especially around June 4. Soldiers, police and state security agents flood the square during the anniversary period, ready to halt even the slightest sign of on-site reporting. With references to the protests long banned in textbooks and print media, the authorities are now busy blocking Google services and scrubbing allusions to the taboo subject in cyberspace, ordering social media to block keywords as subtle as ""this day,"" ""25 years"" and ""between spring and summer."" The ever-stricter censorship may have caused many young Chinese -- people in their 20s and early 30s -- to appear oblivious of the 1989 movement as my colleagues discovered on the streets of Beijing. ""I'm not worried about this thanks to the Internet,"" Wu'erkaixi said. ""Even the small percentage of people who do know is too big for the government to cover it up."" ""People will eventually understand that many issues today stem from social problems that weren't resolved in 1989,"" said Hu Jia, the activist under house arrest. ""In a tyranny, they are deprived of a series of rights -- land grabs, forced home demolitions, educational inequality and environmental pollution are all along the same line."" Measured progress . For the most part, though, many young professionals and entrepreneurs -- while complaining about a widening income gap and rampant official corruption amid a slowing economy -- have told me that they believe in measured progress instead of revolutions for a vast country like China. ""You can call them pragmatic and materialistic, but they are also individualistic -- and individualism has been the perfect incubation for the idea of equality and freedom,"" Wu'erkaixi offered. ""It has happened in the West -- and the younger generations in China will have their glory tune."" But it's unlikely to be ""Nothing to My Name,"" a rock song by Chinese superstar Cui Jian about the dispossessed youth that became the unofficial anthem for Tiananmen Square protesters a quarter century ago.","CNN's Steven Jiang recalls his time as a student in Shanghai during the Tiananmen crackdown .

"(CNN) -- Over the course of my career at BP, from trainee to chief executive, I led two separate lives. The first one involved being the public face of one of the world's largest companies. The second was my private life as a gay man. When I lied in a witness statement to protect my privacy, those two worlds collided, and I lost the career which had structured my entire professional life. I wish I had been braver to come out earlier during my tenure as CEO of BP. I regret it to this day. I wrote The Glass Closet and set up GlassCloset.org to encourage others to avoid my mistakes, and to bring their whole selves to work. That can only happen if leaders, and CEOs in particular, create a corporate environment in which people feel comfortable coming out. Here are six things they can do to smash the glass closet. 1. Follow the leader . Set a clear direction from the top. Businesses must proactively make LGBT inclusion part of the agenda of leaders, rather than delegating it to the human resources department or to a company network. Leaders should be assessed against their ability to create a sustainably inclusive working environment. As I progressed through the ranks at BP, it would have been odd for a chief executive to devote resources to LGBT inclusion. Today, it is increasingly noticeable when they do not. 2. Be authentic . Ensure positive messages are accompanied by meaningful solutions. LGBT conferences, corporate networks and Pride sponsorship are important, but they are not enough, and seldom have a long-term impact in a company. It is the job of a CEO to initiate unremitting, uncompromising and sustainable action, with targets, measurement and sanctions. That is the test of a true leader. 3. Remember the hidden cost of hidden lives . Make an effective business case. LGBT inclusion is first and foremost a human imperative. But it is also good for businesses, which suffer when employees are preoccupied by something other than their work. Peter Sands, the CEO of Standard Chartered, told me that he worries about the hidden costs of hidden lives. He is right to worry. People are happier, more productive, and make more money for their company when they can be themselves. 4. Straight allies matter . Harness the support of the straight majority. Most people are straight, and only they can create a safe space for people to come out. By creating an environment of acceptance, understanding and inclusion, the straight majority can ensure that coming out is not accompanied by the disastrous consequences which closeted employees fear. That should begin by stamping out damaging 'micro-inequalities', such as the assumption that every man is married to a woman, or the practice of not asking gay people about their partners in case it makes them feel uncomfortable. Small changes in behavior can an enormous signal to someone grappling with a hidden life. 5. Celebrate role models . Company policies and behavioral change can create the right space for people to come out, but role models prove that it is possible and worthwhile. That is why The Glass Closet is full of stories, and it is why I set up GlassCloset.org, where gay and straight people can share their stories of sexuality in the workplace. If closeted employees can identify with someone who has been through the closet door and succeeded, then they are more likely to let go of the fears that hold them back. At BP, I did not have an openly gay role model, nor did I have the advantage of looking to another chief executive for precedent. Without a gay role model, I failed to be one for others. 6. Go global . Look beyond your hometown. 77 countries still outlaw homosexual acts between consenting adults. Companies that are committed to LGBT diversity do not bend their policies, even in the most challenging environments. IBM, for instance, does not allow its non-discrimination policies to be adjusted in any of the 170 countries in which it operates. That sends a clear message to governments, who understand the importance of major international companies for their economies. Companies cannot change the law, and LGBT employees in these countries must be mindful of the dangers they could face. But by creating a safe space for people to be open about their sexuality, wherever they are in the world, companies can help those countries to take a step in the right direction.

"Washington (CNN) -- Still reeling from the Costa Concordia accident in January that left at least 30 passengers dead, two of the largest cruise ship industry organizations have announced new safety policies aimed at helping both passengers and rescuers during an emergency at sea. Under two new rules, a record of the nationality of all passengers aboard vessels will be kept on land and made readily available to search-and-rescue teams in an emergency, and passengers will be given a specific set of safety instructions during ""musters,"" or safety drills. Passenger cruise ship regulations previously required companies to record the name and gender of each passenger, and to distinguish between adults, children and infants for search-and-rescue purposes. The new requirement to also record passenger nationality is intended to help ensure rescuers have key information immediately available to them in the event of an emergency. ""Certain governments have indicated that this would be very helpful in accounting for all passengers during rescue operations. In such situations, it is necessary to communicate with consulates and embassies to help locate, account for, and care for those involved in the incident,"" David Peikin, Cruise Lines International Association's director of public affairs, told CNN. ""It was conveyed to us by governments at the (International Maritime Organization) that experience has demonstrated significant value in knowing which officials to contact for this purpose."" The new rule requiring documentation of passenger nationality is not related to security concerns over terrorism, Peikin added. In the new muster policy, the 12 specific emergency instructions given to all passengers include: . 1. When and how to don a life jacket. 2. Description of emergency signals and appropriate responses in the event of an emergency. 3. Location of life jackets. 4. Where to muster when the emergency signal is sounded. 5. The method of accounting for passenger attendance at musters both for training and in the event of an actual emergency. 6. How information will be provided in an emergency. 7. What to expect if the master orders an evacuation of the ship. 8. What additional safety information is available. 9. Information on whether passengers should return to cabins prior to mustering, including specifics regarding medications, clothing, and life jackets. 10. Description of key safety systems and features. 11. Emergency routing systems and how to recognize emergency exits. 12. Who to seek out for additional information. ""Our industry continues to actively identify a range of measures that will improve the safety of passengers and crew, which is the top priority of the cruise industry,"" Christine Duffy, president and CEO of CLIA, said in a statement announcing the new safety policies. In February, CLIA, which represents 26 U.S. cruise ship companies, and the European Cruise Council, with 30 cruise ship companies, announced a policy change requiring all musters be performed prior to leaving port. After the Costa Concordia accident, officials learned about 600 of more than 3,000 the ship's passengers had not participated in the muster drill because they got on the ship within hours of the accident. The massive passenger ship Costa Concordia struck rocks and rolled onto its side in shallow water off an island on Italy's Tuscan coast on January 13. There were roughly 4,200 people on the ship when it ran aground -- about 3,200 passengers and 1,000 crew members, the vast majority of whom made it off the ship safely. Since the accident, the cruise line industry has been under pressure to improve safety measures in place during emergencies. Industry representatives have met several times since the disaster to address concerns. More changes to safety procedures are expected in the coming months.","Groups representing U.S. and European cruise companies announce new safety policies .

"(CNN) -- A report detailing the CIA's controversial interrogation and detention program after the 9/11 terror attacks will be delayed over the issue of redactions, Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman Dianne Feinstein said Tuesday. Congressional sources in each party had previously said the report could have been released as early as this week. ""After further review of the redacted version of the executive summary, I have concluded the redactions eliminate or obscure key facts that support the report's findings and conclusions. Until these redactions are addressed to the committee's satisfaction, the report will not be made public,"" Feinstein said in a written statement. ""I am sending a letter today to the President laying out a series of changes to the redactions that we believe are necessary prior to public release. The White House and the intelligence community have committed to working through these changes in good faith. This process will take some time, and the report will not be released until I am satisfied that all redactions are appropriate,"" she wrote. The document that will be released is a nearly 700-page summary of the full 6,800-page report that was approved a year and a half ago by a committee sharply divided along party lines. Senators on the committee have indicated the report is critical of the CIA's treatment of terrorism suspects, saying it amounted to torture, something CIA officials have denied. It also finds that those harsh interrogation techniques did not help disrupt future terrorist attacks as many in the intelligence community have said. After the committee voted this spring to release a declassified version to the public, the report was sent to the intelligence community and the White House so classified and other sensitive information could be redacted. The report's creation has been highly controversial, with the CIA director apologizing and admitting the agency spied on computers used by Senate Intelligence Committee staffers who prepared the extensive report. According to an administration official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, a ""constructive dialogue"" with the Senate Intelligence Committee about the report is already underway. ""The bottom line is that the United States must never again make the mistakes documented in this report. I believe the best way to accomplish that is to make public our thorough documentary history of the CIA's program. That is why I believe taking our time and getting it right is so important, and I will not rush this process,"" Feinstein said. 'Shocking' report on CIA interrogation closer to public release .

"(CNN) -- The successful U.S. operation to detain Ahmed Abu Khattalah in Libya should be applauded. Khattalah is a suspect in the 2012 attack on the Benghazi mission. The operation to detain him had far more in common with pre-9/11 counterterrorism operations than post-9/11 and could presage a return to America's ability to credibly promote the rule of law in the world. The United States largely lost that ability with the long, drawn-out attempts to justify Guantanamo Bay and the military commissions there, harsh interrogation, and the use of drones to carry out military attacks in places where the United States is not at war. These policies and practices were instituted within days of the 9/11 attacks. As in the Civil War era, the First World War, and the Second World War, national leaders and large segments of the public believed extraordinary measures were warranted. One major difference between those emergencies of the past and today: The measures instituted previously ended far sooner than post-9/11 policies. Last year, President Obama quoted James Madison on the risks to liberty of continual war. It is imperative that the United States return to normalcy to preserve our rights. So while we can debate whether the post 9/11 measures were necessary or successful, no one should continue to argue that we need to leave them in place. The Khattalah operation demonstrates what we knew before 9/11. The law imposes no straightjacket when it comes to apprehending and prosecuting terrorism suspects. We used to be quite good at it. Take the case of Fawaz Yunis, a member of Hezbollah, arrested in 1987. In that year, undercover FBI agents lured Yunis onto a yacht in the Eastern Mediterranean by promising to let him in on a drug deal. Yunis was wanted for the hijacking of a plane in Lebanon with four Americans on board. According to the judge's opinion on the guilty verdict in his case, the FBI agents arrested Yunis once the yacht was in international waters. ""The agents transferred Yunis to a United States Navy munitions ship and interrogated him for several days as the vessel steamed toward ... a Navy aircraft carrier. Yunis was flown to Andrews Air Force Base from the aircraft carrier, and taken from there to Washington, D.C. In Washington, Yunis was arraigned on an original indictment charging him with conspiracy hostage taking, and aircraft damage."" He was convicted and served many years in prison in the United States and Lebanon. Khattalah was also arrested pursuant to an indictment; he was detained under law enforcement authorities, and will receive a trial before a duly constituted court in the United States. Opinion: Why Benghazi issue won't go away . We should not expect any of the tough issues raised every time a hearing of any sort is brought before the Guantanamo Bay military commissions. Those commissions are fatally flawed because they have been established in conflict with both peacetime procedural law and the law of armed conflict. The most serious flaw: The commissions were established after the crimes, to get convictions. Courts need to be established to get justice, following objective criteria of fairness. Nothing can be done to save the commissions. Moreover, nothing needs to be done given the perfectly sound courts in the United States, courts that heard the Yunis case, the cases of the 1993 World Trade Center bombers, the Times Square bomber, pirates, organized crime kingpins, and that will hear Khattalah's case. Of course, trial before a regular U.S. court and an indictment are not the full requirements of the law. To come closer to full legality, Khattalah should have received the Miranda warning by now; he should be questioned by the FBI, not the military, and should have a defense lawyer present if he requests one. It also appears that he was detained without informing the Libyan authorities. In the Yunis case, the FBI was careful not to violate any state's rights by arresting him in international waters. At present, the breakdown of authority in Libya is such that under the international law of countermeasures, the United States can claim the right to carry out a law enforcement action without Libyan consent. (This is an ironic situation since the United States helped create the instability that prevails in Libya by fighting for regime change in 2011.) Moreover, so long as the U.S. military personnel involved in the Khattalah operation followed police-type law enforcement rules, they could lawfully be involved in the detention. Their presence was not an unlawful use of force on Libyan soil. That is one of the major differences between this action and drone strikes. U.S. weaponized drones usually deploy the Hellfire missile, which is a tank-killing weapon only appropriate where the United States is engaged in battle as in Afghanistan or where we have the right of self-defense, which has also only been in Afghanistan post 9/11. In other countries where the United States is using drone attacks -- Pakistan, Yemen, and Somalia -- the United States has not been attacked in a way that can trigger our international right of self-defense. The law requires that the state using military force in self-defense counterattack only when it has been the victim of a significant attack by a state responsible for the attack. When the high threshold for self-defense is not met, countermeasures may be available. That is the law under which the United States publicly defended the raid that killed Osama bin Laden. CIA's John Brennan announced to the world that the Navy Seals who undertook the mission were under orders to arrest bin Laden. Killing him was only authorized if he resisted arrest. In other words, Brennan announced that the Seals followed classic law enforcement rules. United Nations human rights monitors had no objection. In the course of law enforcement there is no tolerance of ""collateral damage"" as on a battlefield. In the bin Laden and the Khattalah operations, family members, neighbors and passersby all survived because the United States did not use drone-launched Hellfire missiles. Drones, Gitmo and torture are not the way to respond to terrorism. Operations consistent with the rule of law are. Whether there was ever a justification for any of these policies post-9/11, it is long over. Time to move on toward the rule of law.","Mary Ellen O'Connell says capturing suspect in Benghazi attack is a good sign .
She says it represents the U.S. returning to using the law to fight terrorism .
O'Connell: Until now, the U.S. has relied heavily on unlawful drone attacks .

"(CNN) -- America's enemies must be laughing. But most of the world is just baffled, mystified at the sight of the world's most powerful country tangled in a crippling web of its own making. The government shutdown is weakening the United States before its allies and its foes. It is eroding American standing and prestige while reducing American power and influence. The democracy that once inspired the world now leaves observers perplexed. This, to put it mildly, is not a time when Americans can say they feel pride in their government. It is a time when America's partners worry about how much they can rely on the commitments from a nation that claims to be a bastion of democracy and freedom, not to mention efficiency and competence. For politicians in Washington, and for the American people, angry and frustrated with the increasingly partisan and dysfunctional government, the shutdown that started on Tuesday looks like a battle over domestic politics. For the rest of the world, the closure of U.S. government institutions says America is growing small, small-minded and unreliable. A small band of extreme right-wing politicians couldn't win the debate, or the vote, or the legal argument over health care, so they decided to close down the government instead. A system that allows that to happen is dangerously flawed and in urgent need of repairs. The self-destructive tactic is undermining American strategic interests while the country's rivals make strides on the global stage. While Russia's Vladimir Putin unabashedly strengthens his position, while China expands its global influence, while America faces enormous challenges, the president of the United States and countless top officials are expending energy on a futile exercise. In recent days -- while Syria burned, Iran maneuvered and Europe wondered if the United States will send the global economy back into recession -- U.S. government officials were busy making plans for a shutdown: deciding what offices will be open, what employees would write on their e-mail autoreplies during the shutdown. In the final hours before the deadline, the United Nations General Assembly was in session and Obama was meeting with world leaders. But his mind was presumably on the blackmail and on the impending shutdown. Americans were also distracted, irritated. In a world filled with crises, the ego-massaging spectacle from Washington managed to steal the spotlight. Bravo. American strategic considerations now take a back seat. U.S. efforts to counter China's influence by strengthening ties with Asian countries have to wait. The long-planned visit to Asia by the president was cut in half to attend to this unnecessary crisis. An aide to Supreme Allied Commander in Europe Gen. Philip Breedlove said the general would cut his travel because of the shutdown. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel correctly noted the shutdown would raise doubts among key allies and would damage American credibility. It is impossible to fully calculate the ways in which this hurts America's standing. U.S. officials cooperate on important projects in every field with international organizations. Their partners are learning they cannot rely on them. The United States used to have one of the most respected forms of government on the planet. Washington was never morally crystalline and pure, but enough respect for the principles of democracy made people in other nations yearn to build a similar system, one in which people with differing opinions debated their positions, voted, and accepted the outcome. Who would want to copy the American system now? The last time the government shut down, in 1995, I was in Bosnia. Back then, as we awaited the arrival of NATO forces, we heard of the shutdown. It seemed inconceivable such a thing could happen during a time of crisis. But at least President Clinton and the Republicans led by House Speaker Newt Gingrich were willing to compromise. And they weren't fighting over an issue that had already been triply settled in Congress, in the courts and at the ballot box. And back then the economy was strong, more resilient, better able to withstand the showdown. Today's dogmatic politicians, protected by like-minded zealots in their districts, are looking at their job in the narrowest possible way. They may want to hurt Obama; they may want to blackmail the president into doing away with his health care program. What they are doing is weakening America and its alliances. They are hurting those people in other lands who are trying to make the case that democracy is the best system. From travel agents in Tokyo to newspaper columnists in Britain, people are trying to explain the inexplicable. Tourists from overseas have been blocked from visiting the Statue of Liberty. International meetings have been canceled, research delayed. The British columnist Martin Wolf tried to break down for his readers how one side would close down the government to stop the health insurance that other countries take for granted. But he concluded that it all ""seems mad."" A journalist in India wrote about her driver and translator laughing at the United States. ""So much for the world's great superpower,"" she tweeted, ""It's closed."" American looks weak, flailing. Set aside for a moment the impact of the shutdown on 800,000 federal workers and their families. Forget just for now the anguish of the people accepted for clinical trials on cancer drugs at the National Institutes of Health. Forget the businesses that rely on income from providing services to government workers, or from tourists visiting national parks. Forget the parents who have no place to take their children with the closure of Head Start-funded programs. Put to the side for a moment the ripples of damage caused within the United States by this exercise in political extremism. Think instead about the impact this has on America's international standing and global interests. The people who caused this travesty are diminishing their country. Perhaps the knowledge that America's enemies are enjoying the spectacle will give them pause; probably not. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Frida Ghitis.","America's enemies may rejoice, but the rest of the world is mystified, writes Frida Ghitis .

"(CNN) -- Not even a week after the ruling in the Trayvon Martin trial, President Barack Obama couldn't wait to stand before the White House press corps and ""speak to an issue that obviously has gotten a lot of attention,"" as he said last July. Yet it took Obama more than a month to address the crisis where 40 veterans allegedly died while waiting months for treatment at a Phoenix Veterans Administration hospital. Congress has held hearings on the grave matter since April and called Veterans Affairs Secretary Eric Shinseki among other witnesses to testify. But Obama just got around to holding a press conference Wednesday on the topic. ""So when I heard allegations of misconduct -- any misconduct, whether it's allegations of VA staff covering up long wait times or cooking the books -- I will not stand for it, not as commander in chief, but also not as an American,"" Obama declared. If Obama is as outraged and ""mad as hell"" as he professes, why did it take him over a month to say anything substantive about vets dying because of months waiting for care? Prior to his long overdue press conference about the VA controversy, Obama only mentioned what has now become another White House scandal in a response to a question from a reporter on April 28 during his Asia trip. During his press conference, Obama said he wasn't going to jump to any conclusions or call for any resignations until ""the investigators do their job and get to the bottom of what happened"" at the VA. He added, ""we have to find out, first of all, what exactly happened."" In contrast, Obama couldn't wait to jump to conclusions and comment on the shooting of the black teen Martin by George Zimmerman before any investigation or trial happened. Obama made extensive comments on the shooting in March 2012 in the Rose Garden. ""You know, if I had a son, he'd look like Trayvon. All of us as Americans are going to take this with the seriousness it deserves,"" he said. Well we certainly didn't hear the president say, if he had served in the military, ""I could have been one of those veterans who died."" Apparently, veterans, who put their lives at risk defending our country then died at the hands of incompetent VA employees aren't worthy of the same attention and ""seriousness"" as Trayvon Martin? Even more indicative of the Obama White House's misplaced priorities is the White House issued a statement from the president on the day of the Tryavon Martin trial verdict last July. No White House statement was issued about the VA allegations. But clearly a statement on the Martin trial wasn't enough. A few days later, Obama held a press conference about the verdict. ""I thought it might be useful for me to expand on my thoughts a little bit,"" Obama noted. Martin's death, though tragic, had nothing to do with national security or government malfeasance and didn't warrant attention from the president of the United States. But Obama felt it was very important to comment on the death of a young black man shot by a ""white Hispanic"" to appease race hucksters like Al Sharpton and Jesse Jackson who helped elect him. Stammering throughout his VA press conference Wednesday, Obama told reporters ""responsibility for things always rests ultimately with me, as the President and commander in chief."" At the same time Obama claims he didn't know how big the problems were with the VA. How can a president be responsible for problems occurring at agencies if he's not aware of the problems? This sounds like the all-too-familiar refrain the White House uses. It didn't know about the IRS scandal or the Department of Health and Human Services' disastrous rollout of Obamacare. Again, Obama promised, ""there is going to be accountability."" ""Listen, if somebody has mismanaged or engaged in misconduct, not only do I not want them getting bonuses, I want them punished,"" he said from the White House briefing room. Hopefully this time, the President means what he says because in past scandals he has held no one accountable. IRS division director Lois Lerner and HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius both were allowed to resign without accountability. Shinseki eventually will do the same.

"(CNN) -- Four gunmen attempted to attack the Indian consulate in Afghanistan's western Herat province early Friday, a spokesman for the governor's office said. A member of the Indian Tibetan Border Police (ITBP), who was guarding the consulate in Herat City at the time, fired at the assailants as they attempted to barge into the building, said Deepak Kumar, a spokesman for the ITBP in New Delhi. The attackers were armed with machine guns and grenades, he said. A car bomb also exploded near the scene but caused no damage. The attackers were eventually surrounded by Afghan security forces as they approached the consulate, according to Herat governor's spokesman Abdul Rauf Ahmadi. Two of the gunmen were killed, Ahmadi said. The consulate was not damaged and no one there was injured. The identity of the attackers or motive for the attack is not yet known.

"(CNN) -- A potent storm system socked the Mid-Atlantic and as far north as New York on Thursday, lashing the region with damaging hail, strong winds and pelting rains. At various points Thursday afternoon and evening, parts of Delaware, Virginia and Maryland were under tornado warnings tied to the system. There were reports of a few possible touchdowns, though thankfully no widespread damage or injuries. Even without twisters, the storms did damage in other ways. Photos posted to Twitter from Wyomissing, Pennsylvania -- which is just outside of Reading -- showed some cars with smashed windshields thanks to large, powerful hail. Lt. Thomas D. Endy said two police cars in town aren't drivable, and three can go out only if absolutely necessary. ""It got really loud,"" said Heather Knaub, who was working at a department store in Berkshire Mall in Wyomissing when the hail started pounding down, eventually caving in some overhead glass windows. ""... It looked like a white-out; hail was everywhere."" The National Weather Service documented scores of other such reports, including ones indicating hail the size of golf balls in locales from Hamden, New York, to Roxbury Mills, Maryland. Central Virginia was particularly hard-hit, with Dominion Electric reporting about 14,000 customers without power around 9:15 p.m. due to hail and strong winds. This activity includes a ""possible brief tornado"" that may have hit in Prince George County, according to the weather service. New York state got its share of bad weather as well, with the weather service tweeting that there was a tornado in Delanson. It later tweeted an image of house there that had been obliterated. Much of upstate New York also had to deal with flooding concerns due to the combination of rain and hail. Some places north of Rome, New York, already got as much as 6 inches of rain, for instance. The system caused temporary headaches for those traveling in and out of the region, with all traffic bound for New Jersey's Newark airport, New York's LaGuardia airport and Philadelphia's airport not allowed to take off until after 6:30 p.m. And the Mid-Atlantic wasn't the only part of the country braving severe weather. Hazardous weather outlooks were once in effect for huge swaths of the central and southwestern United States -- as far north as Montana and North Dakota, as far south as Arizona and Texas, and as far east as Tennessee. The storms were also affecting areas in and around Denver, which was the site of several reported tornadoes on Wednesday. Frontier Airlines tweeted that its call center there was evacuated due to the storm, around the same time Denver International Airport urged travelers to be on-guard for instructions if the situation takes a sudden turn for the worse.

"(CNN) -- Shots were fired this week near the U.S. border with Mexico, with a U.S. official saying they came from a Mexican law enforcement helicopter, something that a Mexican official denies. The Mexican helicopter crossed into Arizona and fired two shots near U.S. border agents, a U.S. law enforcement official said Friday. No one returned fire, and the helicopter returned to Mexico. No one was hurt in the incident, which happened about 6 a.m. local time Thursday about 100 yards into U.S. territory, the official said on condition of anonymity. A separate official, U.S. Border Patrol spokeswoman Vivian McLoughlin, confirmed the helicopter crossed into U.S. territory, saying it happened at 5:45 a.m. Thursday. She did not provide further details. Tomas Zeron, director of the Mexican attorney general's investigative office, offered a different story Friday. While acknowledging Mexican authorities were conducting an operation ""on the border,"" Zeron said, ""I do not think we crossed the border because we brought our navigation. But it was just 100 meters from the border."" He said helicopters from the attorney general's office and defense ministry ""were shot at by criminals,"" several of whom were later apprehended by Mexican authorities. ""The only ones doing the shooting were those that we have now detained,"" Zeron said. The first U.S. source said that Mexican authorities have called U.S. authorities and acknowledged a mistake, saying shots were fired from the helicopter after it accidentally crossed the border. But Zeron gave no indication that any mistake was made or apology was necessary, suggesting that Mexican authorities did nothing wrong. Mexico condemns Border Patrol's lethal force against migrant . Mexican authorities said Thursday's drug smuggling and trafficking operation culminated in the rescue of 39 migrants, detention of four people and securing of a ranch on the U.S. border. This isn't the first case of the two allies having issues along their shared border. Some of these have to do with efforts to corral the drug or weapons trade, with the latter being especially significant in Mexico given fears that such arms could end up in the hands of powerful drug cartels. Citing a response he said came from the Department of Homeland Security, Rep. Duncan Hunter said earlier this month that there have been some 300 documented incursions by Mexican military and law enforcement authorities since 2004. ""While the number of unauthorized incursions by Mexican authorities is relatively few, it is imperative for our officer safety to handle each situation assertively but with sensitivity and professionalism,"" DHS said in a response to Duncan's request, according to the Republican congressman from California.

"(CNN) -- South African President Jacob Zuma was sworn in Saturday for a second term, pledging to focus on the economy in a country battling growing inequality. ""Today marks the beginning of the second phase of our transition from apartheid to a national democratic society,"" Zuma said during his inauguration at the Union Buildings in Pretoria. ""This second phase will involve the implementation of radical socioeconomic transformation policies and programs over the next five years."" His party, the African National Congress, won the general election this month, holding on to power despite economic woes, deadly mining protests and corruption allegations. It got 62% of the vote -- lower than the last time -- with its popularity and that of Zuma's taking a hit due to various issues, including a scandal centered in his private homestead in Nkandla. The state watchdog has alleged more than $20 million of public money was misused in improvements to the sprawling complex. Zuma has denied any wrongdoing. After a turbulent first term, Zuma said his government will perform better this time around and take responsibility for any shortcomings. ""We will ... ensure much tighter accountability, with firm consequences where there is a failure to deliver services to our people,"" he said. He said South Africa has made progress since the days of apartheid two decades ago.

""Economic transformation will take center stage during this new term of government as we put the economy on an inclusive growth path.""

"(CNN) -- A week after dropping its invite-only requirement and letting the masses sign up for accounts, social-bookmarking service Pinterest has made another expansion, this time to Android devices and the iPad. Pinterest is a visual bookmarking tool for collecting and organizing content you find online by theme, such as women's hats, cake recipes, cat photos or motorcycles. Users mark, or ""pin,"" sites they like and make carefully crafted collections that other people can view and share. Since it launched last year, Pinterest has only been available on the Web and through its popular iPhone app. As the company rolled out new features and expanded into additional languages, it has heard one request back from users: Make an Android app. On Tuesday, the company announced three new Pinterest apps, starting with its first Android offering. The engineers at Pinterest built the free Android app from the ground up and optimized it to work on the large range of available Android tablet and smartphone devices. No matter what size device you use, the app's design is the familiar cascade of tiled images. The app is available in the Google Play store and is expected to be in the Android Appstore later this week for Kindle Fire owners. The iPad also got its own Pinterest app, a speedy experience with some nice new user interface touches. Swiping to one side brings up the list of categories, the other direction flips through the layers of pins you've opened. There's an embedded browser in the iPad version of the app. Double clicking on a product such as a pair of shoes will take you to the brand's site within the Pinterest app, and you can then see what other product users have pinned from the same company. ""It's a really different kind of browsing experience,"" said Pinterest co-founder Evan Sharp, who told the story of first seeing Steve Jobs demo the iPad while reclining in a chair. ""It was really amazing because he was using that device exactly how we thought Pinterest would be used sometime in the future."" The Pinterest iPhone app got a refresh, which Sharp said will increase stability and speed. It has an updated design that lets you view two columns of pins. The company announced the mobile news at a gathering in its new San Francisco office space. The summer-themed event featured paper lanterns, finger sandwiches and stations inspired by popular Pinterest topics -- a polaroid photo booth with mustache props, DIY postcards, temporary tattoos and a design-your-own terrarium table with the ultimate Pinterest staple, mason jars. The event was one bluegrass band short of being the ultimate hipster wedding. An in-person announcement is a departure for Pinterest, which typically rolls out features slowly and announces them on its blog. However, the shift to mobile and the gathering of people tied into its newest theme: using Pinterest to do more in the real world. ""Our goal is to actually get you offline, to get you to go out,"" said Pinterest co-founder and CEO Ben Silbermann, citing the large amount of do-it-yourself actionable content people pin on Pinterest. The site's growth has leveled off in recent months after its meteoritic rise from 1.03 million unique monthly users in the United States in August 2011 to 17.8 million in February.Â In July, Pinterest had 23.3 million unique users in the United States, according to research firm comScore. That number is likely to jump again as Pinterest reaches for new audiences with its anyone-is-welcome phase and trio of mobile apps.","Pinterest announces new apps for Android tablets and smartphones .

Damon started working with CNN in 2004 as a freelance producer at the network's Baghdad bureau, before becoming correspondent in 2006. Recognized for her coverage of the fierce battles in Falluja and on Haifa Street in the Iraqi capital, it was her reporting of Youssif, a five-year-old boy burnt in a brutal attack, that highlighted her arresting ability to tell a story. She has also traveled to volatile regions such as Syria, Libya, South Sudan, Congo, Egypt and Kenya. She has covered significant stories such as the Arab Spring, the Red Shirt protests in Thailand and, more recently, the Ukraine crisis from Donetsk. Damon has previously won a number of awards, including an Emmy and Peabody for her contribution to the network's coverage of the Arab Spring, as well as the Investigative Reporters and Editors' IRE Medal award for her reporting on the U.S. Consulate attack in Benghazi, Libya.

"(CNN) -- For the hotel doorman who greeted me on arrival in Kiev this week, the rain storms that have hit the Ukrainian capital served as a metaphor for a different sort of turbulence. ""All of this will pass on the 25th"" he said, referring to Sunday's presidential election. For someone who knows that even restoring some of the basic functions of government is going to be a challenge, the idea that a new president will be able to change the weather was a form of black humor. Barring a major upset, the task of banishing the storm clouds and restoring normality after the tumultuous events of the last seven months will fall to Petro Poroshenko, the veteran insider who won national approval by becoming the only oligarch to support the Maidan protest movement that overthrew Viktor Yanukovych earlier this year. With opinion poll leads of 30% or more over his nearest rival, the only real question seems to be whether he can get the majority needed win on the first ballot, something that hasn't been achieved since Ukraine became independent in 1991. The thing that might just make this possible is the prevailing mood of weariness among voters and the realization that the main beneficiaries of continued uncertainty would be Vladimir Putin and those working to break the country apart. Most recoil in horror at the thought of a divisive and bruising second round. There is even speculation that the runner up might concede for the sake of national unity should Poroshenko fall short of a straight win on Sunday. This is thought likely if second place goes to Serhiy Tihipko, the former Yanukovych ally expected to do well in the south and east. Very few imagine the other main contender, Yulia Tymoshenko, making a similar sacrifice. If and when Poroshenko emerges as president, winning the election is going to seem like the easy part compared to an in-tray of daunting and near impossible challenges. The first will be to put together a parliamentary majority capable of supporting his reform vision. This has become essential with parliament's powers once again increased under the restored 2004 constitution. Poroshenko's preference would be to keep Arseny Yatsenyuk as prime minister, not least because of the credibility he has established with the IMF and Western governments, while broadening the government to include former Party of the Regions people from the east. But, as leader of Yatsenyuk's Batkivshchyna party, Tymoshenko may have other ideas if she calculates that opposition would suit her personal interests better. It may take a painful split within the democratic bloc followed by a major realignment and new parliamentary elections in the autumn before Poroshenko gets the government he wants. Another major challenge will be to find a way of reaching out to the east. Prospects of holding a successful election in the Donbass region have improved following the intervention of the powerful locally-based oligarch Rinat Akhmetov, but suspicions of the government in Kiev and those who brought down Yanukovych run deep, even among those with no time for the violence of the pro-Russian separatists. Poroshenko's plans to visit the region in an early gesture of reconciliation will help, as will his willingness compromise on Russian language status. But the real test will be devising a new constitutional settlement that gives the regions the autonomy they want without increasing the risk of fragmentation. Proposals are being worked on to balance decentralization with programs designed to promote greater social integration between the regions. None of the efforts to promote greater national cohesion will get very far unless Poroshenko can find a way to turn around an economy projected to shrink by 5% this year. With tax rises, wages freezes, spending cuts and large hikes in energy prices on the way under the economic reform program agreed with the IMF, the new president's honeymoon period won't extend very far into the autumn unless he can convince Ukrainians that the foundations of recovery are being built. Signing the economic provisions of the EU association agreement will be an early priority in order to increase trade and strengthen business confidence. But at least some of the important cards are held by Russia. Greater flexibility on the gas price and Ukraine's outstanding gas bill would help to ease the country's weak financial position. Normalizing the situation in the east is vital to bring back investors frightened off by the threat of civil war. That is why coming to some kind of understanding with Russia will be another urgent priority for president Poroshenko. His team is confident that with a strong mandate he will be a negotiating partner Vladimir Putin can't ignore and that an agreement can be hammered out within two or three months. The terms of such a deal remain the most sensitive topic in Ukrainian politics, so details are hard to come by. But they are likely to cover things like Russian access to Ukraine's military-industrial facilities, new gas transit arrangements, the status of Crimea and perhaps an agreement that Ukraine will remain non-aligned. With most Ukrainians still opposed to NATO membership and the Alliance unwilling to admit a divided country, pragmatists argue that this would mean nothing more than facing up to reality. Perhaps the greatest challenge for the new president lies in meeting the expectations for change raised by the Maidan. The mood among the protesters certainly seems to have darkened during the course of the election campaign with many dismissing it as a reversion to politics as usual. They complain about the return of oligarchic influence and expect the dilution of anti-corruption reforms to trigger a new wave of street protests later in the year. To avert popular disillusionment Poroshenko needs to change the relationship between private wealth and public power. This is what his advisers seem to have in mind when they talk about the ""new rules of the game;"" reducing the political influence of oligarchs, insisting that they pay their taxes and ending the culture of favoritism in public procurement. Whether he can go far enough to satisfy the Maidan movement, while securing the cooperation of Ukraine's power elite in meeting the other difficult challenges he has to face is the question that will probably define his presidency. Perhaps changing the weather would be easier after all. READ MORE: Ukraine favors Europe . READ MORE: Prince slammed over Hitler jibe . WATCH MORE: 'Chocolate king' leads in polls .

"Bangkok, Thailand (CNN) -- Former Thai Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra is no longer in military custody, according to a highly placed source in the junta that took over Thailand in a coup d'etat last week. A source close to Yingluck also confirmed to CNN that she was released from a military camp. The former prime minister was ordered to report to the military junta, the National Council for Peace and Order, on Friday. More than 100 others, including politicians and activists, have also been summoned. The armed forces seized power in a coup Thursday after months of turmoil that paralyzed much of the government and caused deadly clashes in Bangkok. Yingluck was freed after she reported to the Thai military, the junta source told CNN, adding that the former prime minister was asked to ""help us maintain peace and order and not to get involved with protesters or any political movement."" The military source, who spoke on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the situation, insisted that Yingluck has freedom of movement and communications. A close aide to the former prime minister could not confirm when Yingluck was released, and contradicted the military's assertion that she was free to move around. ""I don't think she has freedom of mobility and communication,"" the source said. Altogether, around 150 people will be required to appear before the National Council for Peace and Order, a military spokesman said Saturday. Those summoned include academics and one of Yingluck's chief opponents, ""Yellow Shirt"" movement leader Sondhi Limthongkul. The politician suffered a gunshot wound to the head during unrest in 2009 but later recovered. ""We want to give them some time to relax and have time to think over the problem,"" the spokesman said. The council wants to ""adjust their perception and make them think about the country, think about the Thai people as a whole, not just one particular group."" Street protests . Bangkok was for the most part peaceful Sunday, although there was some jostling between protesters voicing their opposition to the coup and security forces. More organized protests are expected in the capital on Monday. The junta has imposed martial law, which includes a curfew, and shut out independent media reporting. CNN International's broadcasting has been blacked out in Thailand. It also dissolved the Senate, according to a statement from the military chief read on the country's broadcast outlets. On Saturday, a number of major TV stations were back on air, including MCOT, TPBS and NBT. Is Thailand safe for tourists? Thai military: Think before you tweet .

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- China is using photocopied pages from a geography textbook for Vietnamese ninth-graders published 40 years ago to help win international support for its claim to the disputed Paracel Islands in the South China Sea. The pages were among documents sent to the Secretary-General of the United Nations, Ban Ki-moon, with a request that they be circulated among the General Assembly's 193 members. It's the latest attempt by the Chinese to prove its ownership of an area that Vietnam also claims as its own, as ships from both countries allegedly jostle each other miles from land in the South China Sea. What's in the Chinese papers? The pages from the geography textbook are just some of the documents in the dossier, which include a map of the region, a note from 1958 and the cover of a World Atlas printed in 1972. ""China sent the note to tell the international community the truth and set straight their understanding on the issue,"" China's deputy permanent representative to the United Nations, Wang Min, said, according to state news agency Xinhua. Beijing is trying to catch up with Vietnam, which has mounted an effective public relations campaign to convince the international community of the merits of its case, said Sam Bateman, senior fellow in the Maritime Security Program at the S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies (RSIS) at Nanyang Technological University. ""They're trying to catch up lost ground,"" he said. ""I think Vietnam has been winning the public relations battle over the past few weeks, ever since this incident blew up."" How did we get here? The latest territorial row between Vietnam and China flared in May when China's National Offshore Oil Corporation (CNOOC) moved the drilling rig near what China calls the Xisha Islands. In Vietnam they're known as the Hoang Sa Islands. China claims CNOOC has been exploring the area for 10 years, and this latest drilling operation ""falls well within China's sovereignty and jurisdiction."" Vietnam says the ""illicit"" rig is placed in its exclusive economic zone and continental shelf, and has demanded China remove the rig, its vessels and resolve its maritime disputes. Both sides have been repeating the claims and demands, but neither has budged. The standoff at sea seems at least likely to continue until China removes the rig, as planned, on August 15. Is a resolution likely? Bateman said the issue was unlikely to be resolved by international arbitration as both countries would be reluctant to risk a negative ruling and potential outcry at home. Especially in the case of Vietnam, who he believes has a weaker claim to the region than China. ""Most objective, independent, international observers agree that China's case for sovereignty over the Paracels is better than Vietnam's for the very reasons that China has now set out in its submission to the U.N.,"" Bateman said. He said the best course of action would be for Vietnam to concede ownership to China, and to negotiate concessions including access to fishing waters and an agreement to jointly develop oil and gas resources. ""Vietnam could negotiate concessions with China but unfortunately it's probably getting increasingly unlikely as the Vietnamese government has locked itself into the idea that the Paracels are indisputably part of Vietnam and there would be a huge public outcry if they appeared now to be conceding sovereignty,"" he said. Vietnam 'understandably caught out' Euan Graham, another senior fellow at the RSIS at Nanyang Technological University in Singapore, said Vietnam was ""understandably caught out by the fact that China was seeking to press its claims."" Relations in the past few years had been good, he said, with agreement reached on a number of fronts that suggested the countries were moving towards a cooperative approach. ""I think the unilateral deployment of an oil rig that's surrounded by a security cordon including naval ships and within the envelope of air cover clearly doesn't pass the 'straight face' test on setting up arrangements of a practical nature. I think it was clearly provocative in that sense,"" he said, of the Chinese oil rig. Claims and counter claims . In its ""position paper"" to the U.N., China accused Vietnamese boats of ""illegally and forcefully"" disrupting the rig's work by ramming Chinese government ships a total of 1,416 times. The note also claimed Vietnam sent ""frogmen and other underwater agents"" to the area, and dropped ""large numbers of obstacles, including fishing nets and floating objects, in the waters."" In its own note to the U.N. last week, Vietnam accused China of ""seriously"" violating its ""sovereign right"" and repeated claims that Chinese ships ""rammed and sank"" a Vietnamese fishing boat carrying 10 men. At the time, China said the vessel had been ""harassing"" a Chinese fishing boat. Analysts say the claims and counter-claims are muddying what should be a clear approach to cooperation in the region, as laid out in the 1982 U.N. Convention on the Law of the Sea. ""Even if it's an area in dispute, there is in the U.N. Law of the Sea an obligation to enter into arrangements of a practical nature,"" Graham said. Bateman agreed that the legal dispute over who owns what was stalling efforts to protect and develop the region. ""What I'm concerned about is all this debate is leading nowhere in terms of establishing effective regimes for managing the South China Sea and its resources,"" Bateman said. ""It's taking us away from the effective cooperation that's necessary because the reality is that I don't think the sovereignty claims are ever going to be settled in the foreseeable future.""","China sends documents to the United Nations backing claim to Paracel Islands .

"London (CNN) -- Princes William and Harry rolled up their sleeves Friday to help out with flood defense efforts as Britain braces for another hammering Friday from a major storm off the Atlantic. The princes showed up at 6 a.m. local time in the flood-hit village of Datchet, west of London. The community is one of several in Berkshire and Surrey to have been hit by flooding in recent days after the River Thames burst its banks. Nearly 6,000 homes have been inundated along the Thames Valley and elsewhere following England's wettest January in 2Â½ centuries. Some communities in low-lying areas of Somerset, in southwest England, have been under water since December. And there's no letup in sight just yet. The Environment Agency has warned of more flooding along the Thames over the weekend as the river reaches its highest level in 60 years. A powerful Atlantic storm that is blowing in on Friday will add to people's woes. Power outages . It comes only two days after a storm blasted western Wales and northwest England, as well as parts of Ireland, with gale-force winds. Some 450,000 properties were affected by power outages as a result of Wednesday's storm. Only 16,000, almost all of them in Wales, were still without power Friday morning, according to the Energy Networks Association, but high winds could cause new problems. The severe weather has affected travel, with many trains delayed or canceled. A sea wall under one coastal section on the main rail line to the southwest collapsed after high seas pummeled it. There were 18 severe flood warnings, meaning a danger to life, in place Friday, most of them in southeast England. Warnings of high winds are also in place for parts of southern England. In the past few days, more than 1,000 homes have been flooded in well-heeled communities along the Thames Valley, including Maidenhead and Windsor, where Queen Elizabeth has a castle. The Environment Agency warned the area could expect ""widespread flooding affecting significant numbers of properties and whole communities and significant disruption to travel"" in the coming days. Climate change role? Central London has been protected from flooding by the Thames Barrier, which prevents high tides surging up the tidal river when it is already full. The Met Office, the UK's national weather service, said the recent series of winter storms ""has been exceptional in its duration, and has led to the wettest December to January period in the UK since records began."" But it's not yet able to say whether climate change is a factor in the extreme weather, as some observers have suggested. ""As yet, there is no definitive answer on the possible contribution of climate change to the recent storminess, rainfall amounts and the consequent flooding. This is in part due to the highly variable nature of UK weather and climate,"" it said. CNN's Zahra Ullah contributed to this report.","Princes William and Harry help out in the village of Datchet, hit by flooding .

"CEBU, Philippines (CNN) -- Amid the tropical heat of a Philippine prison, convicted murderers, rapists and drug dealers on Saturday paid tribute to Michael Jackson with a reprise of their YouTube dance hit, ""Thriller."" Inmates at the prison in Cebu perform their tribute to Michael Jackson Saturday. A rendition of Jackson's 1980s smash hit by prisoners at the Cebu Detention and Rehabilitation Center in the central Philippines garnered more than 24 million views since 2007, when prison supervisor Byron Garcia first uploaded it to the video-sharing Web site. The prison has since posted other dance videos, including performances to Van Halen's ""Jump,"" Queen's ""Radio Ga Ga,"" and Phil Oakey and Giorgio Moroder's ""Together in Electric Dreams."" Jackson, known as the ""King of Pop,"" died Thursday in Los Angeles, less than two weeks shy of the first in a series of comeback concerts in London, England. When he heard the news, Garcia, himself a fan of the 50-year-old pop icon, organized a free tribute performance by inmates for local people in the prison courtyard. Dancing was introduced at the prison in 2007, as a means of rehabilitating prisoners at a facility once notorious for its gang problem.  Watch the prisoners dance » . Every able-bodied prisoner must dance. If they refuse, they lose privileges, mostly conjugal visits. According to Garcia, the dancing occupies up to five hours a day. However he rejected claims he's abusing the prisoners' rights by forcing them to dance so many hours a day. He said it gives them a renewed sense of worth and confidence, breaking them of their violent ways. He is convinced his prison is a model for prison authorities everywhere, an example of how to crack the plague of violent prison gangs. ""It brought back their self esteem. We have happy inmates now -- we don't want to go back to the old jail where we had mad, sad inmates,"" he said. In searing temperatures, 1,400 men in bright orange tracksuits performed the 15-minute ""Thriller"" routine perfectly. They rehearsed for 10 hours the previous day, finally stopping at 3 a.m. to rest ahead of the show. The superbly-choreographed moves, energy and obvious enthusiasm of the prisoners had the audience -- swelled by journalists from around the world -- captivated the audience. Several inmates even invited people from the crowd to dance with them. ""I never thought I would ever find myself dancing with a prisoner,"" one excited local said. A local journalist even described the performance as Asia's best way of paying tribute to Jackson. Garcia, who says the prison has witnessed no violence in three years, paid tribute to the performers. ""I'm so proud of them,"" he said. ""They got the dance exactly right."" Although it was ""probably wishful thinking,"" he added that he had actually wanted Michael Jackson to come to Cebu to dance and play the role himself. ""Now it's not going to happen,"" he said mournfully. Convicted robber Mavin Cabido, 23, said: ""I feel so sad as we idolize him really. The moonwalk is my favorite -- I like that.""","Their 2007 rendition of ""Thriller"" has attracted 24 million views on YouTube .

"Los Angeles, California (CNN) -- Michael Jackson's three children did something recently they've never before done: signing their autographs on something to be sold. Blanket, Paris and Prince Jackson put their names on a designer belt produced as a tribute to their late father and to raise money for the Jackson family museum planned for Gary, Indiana. The merchandising deal for the crystal-encrusted belt is also a first -- the trustees of the Michael Jackson estate authorizing the Jackson family to produce and sell memorabilia in the pop star's name. Katherine Jackson dropped her challenge for control of her son's estate last October, but her husband still has a legal objection pending in probate court. ""This is a truly one-of-a-kind opportunity,"" said Jerry Olivarez, the Jackson family friend who brought the deal together. ""I know of no other item that has ever been made available to the public that has been signed by both the parents and children of Michael Jackson."" The youngest, who was born in 2002, signed his name in true ""John Hancock"" style, taking up the most room with large block letters spelling ""BLANKET."" Prince, 13, helped his younger brother by adding ""Jackson"" below his first name. Paris, 12, showed flair with her signature, using a heart to dot her ""i"" and giving her ""r"" a long, flowing branch. Grandparents Katherine and Joe Jackson sat next to each other on a sofa in the Jackson's Encino, California, home to add their autographs to the ""artist proof"" of the belt. The leather belt was designed by Simon Tavassoli and a limited run of 7,000 are being handmade at his Newport Beach, California, studio.  Each unsigned belt will retail for $1,500, he said. The only belt signed by the three children goes on auction Thursday night, Tavassoli said.","Michael Jackson's kids autograph a tribute belt .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- AEG Live considered ""pulling the plug"" on Michael Jackson's comeback concerts 11 days before the pop icon died, the show's choreographer testified Tuesday. Travis Payne, who worked closely with Michael Jackson in his final days, earlier testified that in Jackson's last rehearsals before his death, he was ""not at show standards but he was rehearsing, he was processing."" Payne was called as a witness by AEG Live to counter Jackson witnesses who testified in the ongoing wrongful death trial that Michael Jackson was emaciated, paranoid and so ill they feared for his life as rehearsals continued until shortly before his death on June 25, 2009. The trial, in which Jackson's mother and three children contend AEG Live is liable in his death, is in its third week in a Los Angeles courtroom. The lawsuit accuses the concert promoter of negligently hiring Dr. Conrad Murray, the physician who was convicted of involuntary manslaughter in Jackson's death. The Jacksons contend AEG Live executives ignored warning signs, including Jackson's weight loss, because they did not want to delay the premiere of the ""This Is It"" concerts set for July 2009. Witness: 'Everybody was lying' after Michael Jackson died . 'Pulling the plug' on comeback . ""It was 'We've got to get this together or the plug may be pulled,' "" Payne testified under cross examination by a Jackson lawyer Tuesday. Jackson was having trouble learning some of his dances in the final weeks, he said. The jury saw an e-mail from show director Kenny Ortega saying Jackson had ""been slow at grabbing hold of the work."" He also asked that a teleprompter be placed near the stage to help him remember song lyrics, something Jackson had never used before during a concert, he said. An e-mail written by ""This Is It"" band director Michael Bearden to Ortega 11 days before Jackson's death was displayed in court. ""MJ is not in shape enough yet to sing this stuff live and dance at the same time,"" Bearden wrote. ""He can use the ballads to sing live and get his stamina back up, Once he's healthy enough and have more strength I have full confidence he can sing the majority of the show live. His voice sounds amazing right now, he needs to build it back up. I still need all big dance numbers to be in the system so we can concentrate on choreography."" But Ortega sent Jackson home without performing at the next rehearsal three days later because he was ill. ""I don't have a dog in this race, so I don't want to be painted as a guy who's trying to mask anything,"" Payne said when Jackson lawyer Brian Panish suggested he was downplaying concerns about Jackson's health in the days before he died. ""Mr. Jackson just explained to me that he had trouble sleeping, that he was tired, and that satisfied me,"" Payne testified. Witness: Jackson was paranoid, talking to himself in last days . He told Jackson, ""You're looking thin,"" and Jackson responded, ""Well, I'm getting down to my fighting weight,"" according to Payne, who added, ""I didn't have a reason to doubt him."" ""Sometimes in rehearsal Michael would appear a little loopy, under the influence of something, but mostly when he would come to the rehearsals from the dermatologist,"" Payne testified. That happened two to four times in the weeks before his death, he said. ""Michael was undergoing personal cosmetic procedures, so he could feel great and do a good job,"" Payne said. Medical records showed Jackson visited his Beverly Hills dermatologist nearly two dozen times in the two months before his death, receiving injections of the powerful painkiller Demerol. ""Sometimes he was tired and lethargic and had to be, not convinced, but supported throughout rehearsals,"" Payne said. Payne, though, said Jackson's rehearsals the last two nights were ""impressive"" when he ""was able to do chunks of the show."" ""He was not at show standards, but he was rehearsing, he was processing,"" he said. ""I didn't expect him to be as if he was in front of a crowd. The last two days were pretty good."" Was he ready to perform for an audience? Panish asked. ""I thought he was on his way to the goals he had set for himself,"" Payne answered. ""All I saw was improvement and getting closer to the goals."" One of those goals was for Jackson to be able to sing all of his songs, while dancing, without the aid of pre-recorded tracks, Payne testified Monday. Jackson had relied on recorded vocal tracks in previous tours, but he didn't want to use them in London, he said. Days before death: 'God keeps talking to me' Michael's kids: Enlightened and loyal . Payne was often inside Jackson's home rehearsing with him during his final weeks. He got an intimate view of what he called ""the beauty"" of Jackson's relationship with his three children. Payne saw ""their loyalty to their father"" and their father ""enlightened them and taught them,"" he testified. ""I was very proud to see Michael as such a loving father."" His description of the close relationship Paris, 15, and Prince, 16, had with their father four years ago could foreshadow the significance of the children's testimony later in the trial. Paris, who was 11 at the time, was ""a very retentive young lady who was very, very smart, very astute,"" Payne testified. ""She had full knowledge of the day-to-day operations, from the time of lunch and what it was going to be, she was hands on -- far beyond her age,"" he said. ""She had a lot of responsibility, which I think she welcomed. Autopsy reveals Jackson's secrets . Payne said she was ""the female of the house"" and ""a daddy's girl."" ""She really loved her father,"" he said. ""At that time, she was coming to find out his global successes and presence, so she would wear her Michael Jackson T-shirt, headband and bag,"" he said. It was Paris who would bless the food when they were having lunch with their father at home, he said. ""She was always the most vocal of the three children and was very concerned about many of the details of the house, was the temperature correct, what do you want to eat,"" Payne testified. ""She just handled a lot for her young age."" Jackson's relationship with son Prince, then 12, was ""awesome,"" Payne said. ""It was great to see how they interacted,"" he said. ""Prince wants to be a director, so Michael would share conversations with him about that process and point out things during our rehearsals."" Blanket, who was 7 his father died, liked to watch his father rehearsing his dances with Payne in the basement studio of their home, Payne said. ""He was quiet, but always right there with his dad,"" he said.","NEW: Jackson was having trouble learning dances, choreographer Travis Payne says .

"(CNN) -- Egyptian army chief Abdel Fattah El-Sisi announced Wednesday that he would resign and declared his candidacy in national elections that are expected later this year. Defense Minister El-Sisi, 59, must leave the army to run for president. He made the announcement on national TV. ""These recent years of our nation's history have conclusively shown that no one can become president of Egypt against the will of the people or short of their support. Never can anyone force Egyptians to vote for a president they do not want. ""Therefore, I am here before you humbly stating my intention to run for the presidency of the Arab Republic of Egypt ... Only your support will grant me this great honor,"" he said. In the wake of the announcement, the office of Interim President Adly Mansour said that he had promoted the chief of staff of Egypt's armed forces, Lt. Gen. Sedki Sobhi, to the rank of first lieutenant general. The state-run Al-Ahram newspaper reported earlier that El-Sisi had met military leaders to tell them he was stepping down. Quoting a military source, Al-Ahram said the meeting would determine a successor to the field marshal. He is expected to submit his resignation to Mansour at a Cabinet meeting on Thursday, Al-Ahram said. Report: Egypt's army-backed government resigns .

"(CNN) -- Stereotypes can rumble around in our collective brains for decades, sometimes centuries, before finally being edged out by a more nuanced understanding of reality. It's been that way with our views about race, creed, sexual orientation and gender roles. The Justice Department's announcement this week that it has changed the definition of rape to include men is one such step on the long road to better understanding. The last few years have seen a growing shift in the way men are perceived, under the collective weight of celebrity bad boys, stay-at-home dads, written scholarship on the supposed ""end of men,"" an epidemic of male incarceration, two decade-long wars fought mostly by men and a nascent men's movement that is not about proclaiming male power but male capacity for depth and goodness. We see men rejecting the stick-figure representation of manhood that gets played out in People magazine. We've gone from ""Mad Men"" to ""Men of a Certain Age"" in no more than a couple of TV seasons. At the front line of this transition is men's understanding of what it means to be a victim. Historically, rape has been viewed narrowly as a crime against women. When I interviewed the first victim to come forward in the Catholic sex-abuse scandal in Boston, he legally wasn't talking about rape. Nor were the countless other men we have featured on The Good Men Project who have been sexually assaulted. Why? Because of the belief that real men don't get raped. But in fact they do. What we know from working with thousands of men in our community of readers and writers is that men are often ashamed to come forward and say they were raped. As the victim in Boston told me: ""I don't think that people in general realize the long-term effects that it has on people. I think some people think just, OK, that happened 20-40 years ago. Buck up, things happen. Be a man."" For some victims of male attackers, homosexual rape adds a layer of shame and confusion to the violent trauma itself. Then there is the misperception that men's sex drives are so high that they ""must have liked it"" when forced to have sex with a woman or even another man. There is a completely antiquated and inaccurate assumption around male sexuality and how damaging forced sexual contact is no matter who you are. Without acknowledgement that rape of men exists, there is less help and support for them to overcome the trauma. The very reason for the Justice Department's decision is to more accurately count rapes and to better allocate government resources, which up until now did not include programs to help male rape victims. Sexual abuse often follows a tragic pattern in which a victim, if left untreated, ends up becoming an attacker. The fact that so many rapists were themselves abused doesn't excuse their behavior. But as a society we have to break the silence about victims to break the cycle of abuse. Clearly, there are still far more women who are raped than men. But justice is no zero-sum game. Acknowledging male suffering doesn't diminish the need to stop sexual violence against women. It just sheds a stereotype that no longer serves men or women. For men to be thinking hard about how to be better fathers and husbands can only benefit women, as can the acknowledgment that men are all too often victims of rape. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Thomas Matlack.","Thomas Matlack: Justice Dept.'s including men in definition of rape challenges stereotypes .

"ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) -- Laura Hathaway initially had no regrets after getting a tattoo on her lower back when she was 21. But now, 10 years later, she wants it gone. Tattoo removal is more painful than the original tattoo, patient Laura Hathaway says. The pharmaceutical sales representative from Atlanta, Georgia, says it doesn't fit in with her current lifestyle as the mother of a 2-year-old boy who just started to talk. ""The other day I bent over and he said, 'What's that?' and it just confirms why I'm having it removed."" Dr. Scott Karempelis of Atlanta Dermatology Associates is performing a multitreatment laser procedure that will gradually erase Hathaway's tattoo with little or no scarring. The process is painful, expensive and time-consuming. Karempelis says that in spite of the drawbacks, ""business is booming."" He and three other dermatologists in his office see more than 30 patients a day who want tattoos removed by laser.  Watch Hathaway's tattoo beginning to disappear » . The American Academy of Dermatology reports tattoo regret is common in the United States. Among a group of 18- to 50-year-olds surveyed in 2004, 24 percent reported having a tattoo and 17 percent of those considered getting their tattoo removed. Karempelis uses a state-of-the-art laser that targets the pigment in the tattoo. ""It goes through the skin without damaging it and hits the pigment depending on which wavelength and which color you have, and it blows it into small pieces."" The tattoo ink is then reabsorbed into the body through the lymphatic system. The process must be completed over several sessions in order to protect the skin from damage. Hathaway expects to go through 10 sessions several weeks apart, each lasting less than a minute. She admits it's a lot more painful than getting the original tattoo. ""It's prickly,"" describes Hathaway. ""It feels like a bee is sitting on your back stinging time and time again. Afterwards, the pain does go away and you're a little sore for a few hours."" Patients with bigger tattoos are sometimes given the option to use a topical anesthetic, but Karempelis points out that it adds to the cost. Like other dermatologists, he charges by the square inch for the laser treatment. By the time Hathaway's done, she expects to pay more than $2,200. There's no guarantee that she won't have a scar. ""Scarring is your major risk,"" says Karempelis. ""Almost everyone gets a little bit of discoloration, a little lighter, a little darker for a while. But in most cases if you wait a year, you cannot see where it was done initially."" Certain tattoo colors, such as green, yellow and purple, are harder to remove, Karempelis says, especially for people with darker skin. Some parts of the body also pose a challenge. ""The farthest away from the heart are hardest to treat, so the ankles are the toughest,"" Karempelis says. He predicts his business will increase in the future, after a new type of tattoo ink hits the market. Freedom-2 is a microencapsulated dye. It's designed to be easily removed by a single laser treatment. ""The laser would hit that pigment and it would completely dissolve immediately. ... You wouldn't need repetitive treatments,"" the doctor says. But until the ink becomes available, Karempelis expects to see a variety of patients going through long sessions to remove reminders of their past. He says the most popular tattoos to be removed in his office are the names of old boyfriends and former spouses. In Hathaway's case, her tattoo of a flower didn't fit the image she wants to portray. She says she got the tattoo long before low-rise pants became popular. ""It's just something I wanted to be private and now it's not."" E-mail to a friend .

"(CNN) -- There are many lessons to be learned from our experiences before and after 9/11. One lesson is that when you get a wake-up call...Wake Up! We received many wake-up calls from Osama bin Laden before 9/11. February 1993:  The first World Trade Center attack by Ramzi Yousef, Omar Abdul Rahman (the blind Sheikh) and its financier, Khalid Sheikh Mohammad. Six people were killed and more than 1,000 were injured. June 1993: Rahman and others were charged in a plot to bomb New York landmarks including the Lincoln Tunnel, George Washington Bridge and the FBI's New York office. October 1993: Al Qaeda-trained followers kill 18 and wound 73 U.S. military officers in Mogadishu, Somalia, now known as ""Black Hawk Down."" August 1998:  The bombings of U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania leave 12 Americans and hundreds of others dead. The FBI places bin Laden on its Ten Most Wanted list. October 2000: The bombing of the USS Cole in Yemen kills 17 sailors. September 11, 2001: The coordinated attack included four hijacked planes, two of which were flown into each World Trade Center tower and a third into the Pentagon. The fourth crashed in a Pennsylvania field when passengers heroically stormed the cockpit. In the summer of 2001, the declared priorities of the Department of Justice were guns and gangs. An FBI request for hundreds of additional agents, analysts and linguists for its counterterrorism program was rejected and returned on September 10. Since 9/11, we have spent trillions of dollars fighting two wars and reorganizing the federal law enforcement and intelligence community. Significant enhancements were made to existing agencies, and the Department of Homeland Security, including the TSA, was created. Are we safer today? I agree with experts who believe that a large sophisticated and coordinated attack such as 9/11 is extremely unlikely. The decimation of al Qaeda, the killing of bin Laden, the monitoring of the global financial network and international communications among terrorists, greater international sharing of information and public awareness make it nearly impossible to duplicate the scale and scope of the 9/11 plan. The United States has now received ""specific, credible but unconfirmed"" information that one or more vehicles containing explosives may be used for an attack in New York and/or Washington this weekend. This reporting makes no mention of a large scale attack using aircraft. It is considered credible because accurate information has been previously obtained from this source. However, it is unconfirmed because the terrorists have not been identified and the actual attack plan has not been verified. I offer a lesson from history to support my belief that smaller attacks will continue for decades. Although Hitler died in his Berlin bunker in April 1945, ""Hitlerism"" lives on: . In 1977, the National Socialist Party of America, a neo-Nazi group, held demonstrations in the Chicago area. ""The Turner Diaries"" by William Pierce was first published in 1978 and is considered the inspiration for the creation of numerous groups and the commission of many crimes. These include the 1984 murder of Jewish radio talk show host Alan Berg and the 1995 attack on the Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City. This year, on January 19, a bomb was placed on the Martin Luther King Day parade route in Spokane, Washington. A man with past ties to a neo-Nazi group, the National Alliance, has pleaded guilty. If these events still occur 66 years after Hitler's death, what can we expect during the next 66 years following bin Laden's death? The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Thomas V. Fuentes.","Thomas Fuentes: Lesson of 9/11 is to pay attention to threats .

"(CNN) -- Opening statements in the Michael Jackson wrongful death trial will be heard Monday, April 29, with the first testimony soon to follow, the judge announced Tuesday. Michael Jackson's mother and three children are suing AEG Live, claiming the concert promoter was liable in the pop star's June 25, 2009, death. Jury selection concluded Tuesday afternoon with selection of six alternates to back up the 12 jurors chosen Monday. Jackson Lawyer Brian Panish called it a ""good, diverse"" jury after the 12 main jurors were seated Monday. The main jury panel includes six men and six women, and there are four male and two females alternates. The trial, which could last three or four months, is expected to include testimony from Prince and Paris Jackson, the singer's two oldest children, and a list of celebrity witnesses. Jackson died two weeks before his ""This Is It"" comeback concerts, organized by AEG Live, were to have debuted in London in summer 2009. Lawyers for Jackson's mother, Katherine; and children, Prince, Paris and Blanket, argue that AEG Live is liable because the company hired and supervised Dr. Conrad Murray, who used a surgical anesthetic in a fatal effort to treat the singer's insomnia as he prepared for the comeback concerts. Murray was convicted of involuntary manslaughter and is serving a prison sentence. AEG Live's lawyers argue that Jackson chose and controlled Murray. The lawsuit seeks a judgment against AEG Live equal to the money Jackson would have earned over the course of his remaining lifetime if he had not died in 2009. If AEG Live is found liable, it could cost the company several billion dollars, according to estimates of Jackson's income potential. AEG Live is a subsidiary of AEG, a global entertainment company that was up for sale recently with an $8 billion asking price.","Jury selection concluded Tuesday with selection of six alternates .

"(CNN) -- Flying fashionistas with a thing for the Second Amendment may want to leave their gun-themed purses and other paraphernalia at home, lest they be flagged as a security risk and miss their flights. As she was flying home after the recent holiday weekend, Virginia Gibbs' gun-themed purse was flagged as a security risk by Transportation Security Administration officials at the Norfolk, Virginia, airport. While Gibbs told CNN affiliate News 4 JAX that she's carried the purse on many flights, the 17-year-old says she was told that the purse ""was a federal offense because it's in the shape of a gun. I'm like, 'a design on a purse. How is it a federal offense?' "" Purses or belts with gun emblems can fall under a TSA prohibition on replica weapons because they could be mistaken for a real weapon in the X-ray machine or by a fellow passenger. ""Security checkpoints may be impacted or closed because replica weapons like toy guns, novelty grenades, fake bombs and other items appear similar to the real thing when viewed through an X-ray machine,"" TSA spokesman Greg Soule said. ""Checkpoint closures cause significant delays, which can be avoided if passengers don't bring these items to the airport."" By the time TSA officials figured out that the purse was a fake, offering Gibbs the opportunity to give up the purse or check it, Gibbs had missed her flight and was placed on another to Orlando. Her frantic mother drove from Jacksonville to Orlando to pick her daughter up. Gibbs arrived at security 20 minutes before her flight was due to depart, which may have caused her to miss her flight, according to a security official. The TSA says it's investigating her allegation that the purse has made it through airport security before.","Teen's gun-themed purse gets flagged by TSA .

"(CNN) -- Nancy Judd turns an orange rind into sequins. A can of Coke becomes shiny bangles. Plastic bags melt into chic crinkly fabric. What others call trash is her high fashion. Her newest creation is ""The Environmental Steward-ess,"" a 1940s air hostess suit sewn from leather seat covers donated by sponsor Delta Air Lines. Judd stitched the suit's superhero cape from safety cards once found in seatback pockets. Her apparel is more for learning than wearing. ""I love taking garbage -- something that people want to push away from and not think about -- and transform it into something elegant,"" said Judd, 42, of Santa Fe, New Mexico. ""I love when they look at a dress and say, 'Wow, those are bottles or cans,' or whatever."" Judd has crocheted videotape into a full-length coat. She has crushed glass into an evening gown. After her cocktail dress made of vinyl Obama-Biden banners made it to the Inauguration, Judd declined a spot on ""Project Runway."" She prefers grass-roots projects that she details on her website Recycle Runway. ""I am an artist making wearable art,"" she said. ""I'm also not attracted to the fashion industry. It creates a tremendous amount of waste, and there are a lot of social justice issues, although a lot of designers are doing good stuff."" Her work has been displayed across the country at shopping malls, museums and airports. The latest installation of her ""Recycle Runway"" exhibit of 18 eco-trash garments will go up this week at Atlanta's Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport. Judd recently spoke with CNN.com about her creative process. CNN: How did you start making recycled fashion? Judd: My mother owned a gallery and directed a college of art, and I spent my whole life in art classes. I loved to sew. In college, I got a degree in art and sociology. One year, my art school got a new pop machine. The garbage can next to it grew with all the pop cans. Seeing them thrown out just seemed wrong. I put a recycling bin next to the pop machine. I started wondering: Where does trash go? Who picks it up? After that, my career path was in solid waste and recycling. 5-star restaurant recycles your meals  and other green food stories . As the recycling coordinator for Santa Fe, to promote a weekend-long exhibit of recycled art, I threw together a little outfit made of bubble wrap. Each year, I made another dress, getting more and more intricate. Now, I can't imagine using anything but trash. If somebody gave me a $200-a-yard fabric, I would be at a loss. CNN: Besides the landfill, where does your art come from -- the vision? Judd: Honestly, it feels like divine intervention. Artistically, I have a sense of confidence that doesn't really line up with the rest of myself. I don't know why I can say to Delta or Toyota, ""Send me your waste and I will create something I know you will love."" All I can say is that my art comes from a spiritual, creative relationship that is so interesting to me. CNN: Do you have a favorite piece? Judd: That's like picking a favorite child. The Eco-Dress really pulls together everything. It's a Scarlett O'Hara-style dress made of [scrap paper] pledges written by 2,000 children across the country. Having people involved really feeds the mission of what I'm doing. CNN: Do you use a special sewing machine? Judd: I use a regular one from my sponsor Janome. I've sewn inner tube tires fine, and the soft top of a Toyota convertible. CNN: Explain how the stewardess cape of safety cards only looks cheery. Judd: The cards are really colorful, really whimsical. I researched the super-heroine Wonder Woman, created in the 1940s -- the same era this type of suit was worn by Delta stewardesses -- by a psychologist to provide a strong role model for young girls. In addition to her invisible plane and bulletproof bracelet, Wonder Woman was given a lasso of truth that made men be honest. This garment is about being a role model who is strong and stands up for the environment. The safety cards are scenes of people preparing for a crash. The cards ask, ""What if?"" That sort of emergency is happening around the world with the environment, because of our decisions. My art is about what we can do in our lives to live lighter on the Earth, and to prepare ourselves. Like the safety cards, the message is about conservation and preparation. CNN: What details are less obvious? Judd: The cape looks windblown because of the wire armature holding it up, made from yard signs from the Obama campaign. CNN: How much do you charge for a commission, and who pays? Judd: About $10,000. A dress will take anywhere from 150 to 450 hours to make. The contract allows me to keep the dress for future exhibitions. I only work with organizations that are doing something substantial for the environment. One of my sponsors, Coca-Cola, is creating bottles that are plant-based and has started the first bottle-to-bottle recycling plant! CNN: What are some of the environmental hazards of creating eco-conscious art? Judd: I only iron plastic outside. I wear a heavy-duty respirator mask around chemicals and when I drill metals. CNN:  Is your tetanus shot current? Judd: It should be, but I don't think it is. CNN: What size are your dresses? Judd: For a while, I made all my pieces about a size 12, because honestly, I was the only available model. CNN:  Describe a future piece. Judd: The Biodegradable Dress starts with cheesecloth -- a lot of people in Santa Fe make their own cheese. Attached are sequins in a turn-of-the-century pattern. The sequins are being made in public workshops from oranges and tangerines. After eating, people punch peels into small circles and dry the circles on a pin. This dress will be sturdy enough to last 100 years. Throw it on a compost pile, and it could disappear in a month.

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Michael Jackson told his tour director days before he died he was hearing God's voice, a producer testified Wednesday. ""God keeps talking to me,""Jackson said. Those words spoken to Kenny Ortega and Jackson's frail appearance were so disturbing that it caused Ortega and associate producer Alif Sankey to burst into tears at a rehearsal, Sankey said Wednesday in a wrongful death lawsuit filed by Jackson's mother and three children. Jackson, who was being fitted for his costumes, appeared ""extremely thin"" and ""was not speaking normally"" at the June 19, 2009, rehearsal, Sankey told jurors in a trial to determine if concert promoter AEG Live should be held liable in the pop icon's death. Jurors saw a photo of Jackson at the costume fitting that showed an obviously thin and gaunt man. Sankey testified that she and Ortega cried together after Jackson left. On her way home, Sankey stopped her car to call Ortega ""because I had a very strong feeling that Michael was dying."" ""I was screaming into the phone at that point,"" Sankey testified. ""I said he needs to be put in the hospital now."" Autopsy reveals Jackson's secrets . Sankey became emotional as she testified about the call. ""I kept saying that 'Michael is dying, he's dying, he's leaving us, he needs to be put in a hospital,'"" Sankey said. ""'Please do something. Please, please.' I kept saying that. I asked him why no one had seen what I had seen. He said he didn't know."" Ortega sent a series of e-mails early the next morning that resulted in a meeting at Jackson's house between Jackson, Dr. Conrad Murray, AEG Live President Randy Phillips and Ortega. An e-mail from Phillips after that meeting said he had confidence in Murray, ""who I am gaining immense respect for as I get to deal with him more."" Jackson defender files sex abuse claim . ""This doctor is extremely successful (we check everyone out) and does not need this gig, so he (is) totally unbiased and ethical,"" Phillips' e-mail said. The lawsuit contends that Phillips and AEG never checked Murray out. Otherwise, they would have known he was deeply in debt and vulnerable to breaking the rules in treating Jackson to keep his job, it argues. Jackson lawyers contend that AEG Live is liable for Jackson's death because the company negligently hired, retained or supervised Murray -- who was convicted of involuntary manslaughter in Jackson's death. Jackson's last rehearsal was at the Staples Center in downtown Los Angeles on June 24, 2009. Security camera video shown to the jury Wednesday showed him walking with a blanket wrapped around him as he passed Sankey. ""He didn't look good,"" she testified. ""I asked him if he was cold, and he said 'Yes.'"" Jackson sang two songs that last night on stage: ""Thriller"" and ""Earth Song,"" she said. ""He did it,"" Sankey said. ""He went through it. He wasn't in full performance mode."" Sankey said she was standing next to Ortega at a rehearsal the next afternoon when Randy Phillips called to tell him Jackson was dead. ""Kenny collapsed in our arms,"" she said. The lawsuit contends that AEG Live executives missed a series of red flags warning them that Jackson's life was at risk because of Murray, who was giving him nightly infusions of the surgical anesthetic propofol to treat his insomnia. The coroner ruled Jackson had died from an overdose of propofol in combination with several sedatives on June 25, 2009. Murray told investigators he used the drugs to help Jackson sleep so he could be rested for rehearsals. AEG lawyers argue Jackson, not their company, chose and supervised Murray, and that their executives had no way of knowing what the doctor was doing to Jackson in the privacy of his bedroom. Michael's creativity . In contrast to six days of testimony mostly about Jackson's death, jurors did hear about the pop icon's creativity during Sankey's testimony . ""Michael's imagination was endless,"" Sankey said. ""He would visualize it, and it happened. It was amazing."" Katherine Jackson dabbed tears from her eyes as her son's ""Smooth Criminal"" video was played in court. Sankey first met Michael Jackson when she was a dancer in the 1987 video production. ""We got to see Michael's imagination come to life,"" Sankey said. ""That was my first time as a dancer, as an artist, that I was completely inspired by his craft and inspired by his attention to every detail. He was so detailed and he never missed a thing."" Working with Jackson was ""magical,"" she said. ""I dream still to this day that I will be able to create on that level of magic that Michael created,"" Sankey said. ""It was like living a dream of working with an artist like that, and I will treasure it and have it in my memory forever."" Sankey's work as an associate producer and dancer for Jackson's ""This Is It"" tour put her on the witness list in this trial. ""He shared with me that he was excited to do the show,"" she said. ""He was excited to show his kids, finally to show them who he was, what he was all about; he was very excited about that."" Jurors heard about Jackson's relationship with his three children and their love of their father. Sankey described how they would come with their father to the set each day in early June when he was filming video elements for the show. ""Paris had a purse, and inside her purse, she had all this candy in her purse she didn't want her daddy to know about,"" Sankey said. ""She had these little pictures of her father in her purse that were in frames. She had, like, a lot of them. Her purse was full of candy and pictures of her daddy."" ""They loved their daddy,"" she said. The ""This Is It"" concert would have been ""a pretty big show,"" Sankey told jurors. ""It was going to be huge and it was going to be innovative, different,"" she testified. ""From working with Michael in my past, I knew it had to be something that no one's ever seen. It all had to be new and pioneering."" The next witness when court resumes Thursday morning will be Michael Jackson's longtime hair and make up artist, Karen Faye. She was quoted in interviews after Jackson's death saying that the pop star was in ill health weeks before he died. Spectators in the small Los Angeles courtroom Wednesday morning included Judge Lance Ito, famous for presiding over the O.J. Simpson murder trial in 1995. Ito was there to watch his friend, Judge Yvette Palazuelos, preside over this trial and then go to lunch with her.","Producer testifies she begged AEG Live to put Jackson in a hospital .

"(CNN) -- Nico Rosberg overcame accusations of gamesmanship to beat his Mercedes teammate Lewis Hamilton and win a tense and at times dramatic Monaco Grand Prix. The German driver led from the start with early championship pace setter Hamilton, nursing an eye injury later in the race, having to make do with second place. Red Bull's Daniel Ricciardo finished third. But the race, much like the build up, was dominated by tensions between the two Mercedes drivers. With Rosberg and Hamilton -- who were separated by just three championship points going in to the race -- vying for pole position on the final lap of qualifying Saturday, Rosberg left the track after his front wheel locked. The stewards brought out caution flags, preventing Hamilton from completing his final qualifying lap and handing pole to Rosberg. Rosberg claimed it was a simple error and a steward's inquiry agreed, concluding that there was ""no evidence of any offense."" But Hamilton was less convinced. ""I found the time at the end and wasn't able to execute it so it wasn't a true showing of my true pace,"" the British driver told the BBC after qualifying. ""But I should have known that was going to happen and done it the lap before,"" he added. Despite Mercedes non-executive chairman Niki Lauda voicing fears that the two drivers may collide at the first corner, the front row got away without incident and Rosberg built a strong lead on a course renowned for its difficulty in overtaking. A stalemate followed until lap 28 when Sauber's Adrian Sutil crashed out, causing the safety car to come and provoking a flurry of tactical pit stops. Thereafter Hamilton caught up with Rosberg, and looked set to challenge for the lead, until he suddenly dropped back, complaining to his team that he couldn't see out of his left eye. In the end Hamilton was lucky to clinch second after Ricciardo pulled close in the final laps. But Hamilton held on. The result saw Rosberg take the lead in the drivers championship, with Hamilton dropping back to second. But with many making comparisons between the famously bitter team rivalry between Ayrton Senna and Alain Prost, the battle, and the mind games, are likely to continue until the last race of the season.","Mercedes' Nico Rosberg wins Monaco GP .

"Tripoli (CNN) -- Libya's interim parliament Sunday approved a new government, led by Prime Minister Ahmed Mitig, in a controversial vote that threatens to deepen the country's political and security crisis. A total of 83 of 93 members present voted in favor of Mitig's government. Lawmakers in the Islamist-dominated General National Congress (GNC) defied a threat issued by militias allied with renegade general Khalifa Haftar, who promised to storm, raid and arrest members. The threat was issued by the same group that attacked the GNC headquarters in Tripoli last week, triggering fighting across the capital that left at least four people dead and dozens injured. Shortly before the vote in parliament, the EU's special envoy to Libya described the situation as the country's worst crisis since 2011. ""This is the worst crisis Libya has known since the war. Political forces should understand the anxiety of the Libyan people, who expect effective solutions for their daily concerns and problems,"" Bernardino Leon told reporters. Leon called on politicians to work inclusively and democratically for a political road map and to ""enable peaceful early parliamentary elections."" Also Sunday, the outgoing culture minister warned the GNC's insistence on confirming Mitig's government could lead to more violence. ""Today the GNC is beating the drums of war. They want to drive the country into an armed conflict for power after all peaceful and political means have been exhausted ... They are leading the country into a direct confrontation,"" Al-Habeeb al-Amin told Libya al-Ahrar TV. Mitig, a businessman from the city of Misrata, was chosen to form a cabinet earlier this month in a disputed vote pushed through by the Islamist blocs. For months, divisions between Islamists and more moderate blocs within the GNC have nearly paralyzed the political process and increased tensions in the country among militias affiliated with the different parties. The emergence of Haftar and his self-declared Libyan National Army escalated tensions last week, as the retired general called for the overthrow of the GNC he described as ""illegitimate."" Haftar also launched what he called an open-ended war on Islamist extremist groups and vowed to ""purge"" Libya of them. His campaign has widened divisions in the country with Islamist and anti-Islamist camps. In an effort to try to ease tensions, Libya's electoral commission announced early elections will be held on June 25. On Friday, Libyans rallied in Tripoli, Benghazi and other Libyan cities in support of the campaign led by Haftar. While some Libyans don't back the ex-general and don't want want military rule, they support what he is doing. But some say his campaign is an opportunistic strategy capitalizing on growing discontent in Libya with a weak central government and a deteriorating security situation. Haftar was once a general in the Libyan army under dictator Moammar Gadhafi but had a falling out with him and immigrated to the United States, where he lived for almost 20 years. He returned in 2011 to participate in the revolution that overthrew Gadhafi.","A total of 83 of 93 members present voted in favor of PM Ahmed Mitig's government .

"(CNN) -- Firefighters in Nevada have fully contained a wildfire that engulfed dozens of homes and burned nearly 2,000 acres, an incident commander said Monday. The Caughlin Fire in Reno burned 1,935 acres before firefighters contained the blaze, said Sierra Fire Protection District Chief Mike Brown, the incident commander. The blaze has made 32 homes uninhabitable and damaged five, but is no longer a major threat to other structures, Reno Fire Chief Michael Hernandez said Sunday. The cause of the fire remains unknown, but Hernandez said his department has ruled out that the blaze started at a homeless encampment or that teenagers seen in the area were responsible. Investigators believe -- though have not confirmed -- that high winds caused electrical arcing on a power line, which sparked the fire, Hernandez said. The city of Reno, the rest of Washoe County and Nevada all declared states of emergency Friday. The fire was reported shortly after midnight Thursday, spreading within an hour and becoming a three-alarm blaze, Hernandez said. The blaze ballooned within about 12 hours, destroying some structures and causing minimal damage to others, according to the fire chief. He estimated that firefighters had saved 4,000 to 4,500 homes by Friday. CNN's Shawn Nottingham contributed to this report.","The Caughlin Fire is contained at 1,935 acres, a fire chief says .

"(CNN) -- Move over, Mauna Loa. A group of scientists say they've found a volcano bigger than you. Way bigger. An underwater volcano dubbed Tamu Massif was found some 1,000 miles east of Japan, says William Sager, a professor at the University of Houston, who led a team of scientists in the discovery. The volcano is about the size of the state of New Mexico and is among the largest in the solar system, Sager says. World's coolest volcanoes . Tamu Massif covers an area of about 120,000 square miles. In comparison, the largest active volcano on land, Hawaii's Mauna Loa, is about 2,000 square miles, Sager says. ""Its shape is different from any other sub-marine volcano found on Earth, and it's very possible it can give us some clues about how massive volcanoes can form,"" Sager says. Tamu Massif is believed to be about 145 million years old, and became inactive within a few million years after it was formed. The volcano was partly named in honor of Texas A&M University, where Sager worked for 29 years before moving to the University of Houston. Tamu is the university's abbreviation while massif is the French word for ""massive"" and a scientific term for a large mountain mass, according to Sager. 31 beautiful sights on this incredible planet .","The underwater volcano is called Tamu Massif .

"(CNN) -- Critical water pipelines are breaking from coast to coast, triggered by this summer's record high temperatures. It's not a phenomenon or coincidence, experts say. It's a clear sign that Americans should brace for more water interruptions, accompanied by skyrocketing water bills. The heat wave of the past few weeks has burst hundreds of crucial pipes in California, Kansas, Oklahoma, Texas, Indiana, Kentucky and New York, temporarily shutting off water to countless consumers just when they needed it most. ""It's one of the worst summers,"" said Debbie Ragan of Oklahoma City's Utilities Department. As days of 100 degree-plus temperatures bake the region, the utility reports 685 water main breaks since July alone. That's an estimated rate of four times normal. To keep up with repairs, Ragan said, workers have been putting in 12-to 16-hour shifts 24/7. ""It's the heat and the high water usage,"" Ragan said. High temperatures can dry soil so that it shrinks away from buried pipes. Increased water usage raises pressure inside the water lines. Both factors add strain to pipeline walls, making older pipes more susceptible to bursting. It underscores the fact that much of the nation's underground water lines are 80 to 100 years old -- and approaching the end of their lives. Experts call it America's ""Replacement Era,"" when hundreds of water utilities nationwide will be forced to replace their aging infrastructure -- or suffer the consequences. Who will probably have to pay for those hundreds of thousands of miles of new pipelines? Utility customers, industry experts say. Water rates ranked for 50 cities . For towns like Kemp, Texas, population 1,150, the situation reached emergency levels this week. A historic drought throughout Texas has left Kemp with what Mayor Donald Kile described as ""cracks so big in the ground, you could lose a small dog in them."" Fourteen major water line breaks August 7 emptied water towers and forced Kemp to shut off water service until Tuesday, officials said. The mayor blamed the crisis on 80-year-old pipelines and high demand as temperatures rose above 100 degrees for 37 straight days. Texas town turns off water, leaving residents boiling mad . It's even worse in the Texas town of Robert Lee. The hellish heat has left its entire reservoir dry as a bone. Community leaders are considering trucking water in from elsewhere or laying a 12-mile pipeline to connect to water in a nearby town. Get ready for more of the same, environmentalists say. Shifting climate change in the coming decades, they warn, will probably bring more droughts, record high temperatures and other weather conditions that will damage water infrastructure. Texas town threatened by dried-out reservoir . Options to ensure water for small towns like these are few and expensive, ranging from building larger reservoirs to connecting their water systems to utilities in nearby areas. ""That kind of interconnection might be life-saving for that community,"" said Tom Curtis of the American Water Works Association. But the expense of laying miles of pipe may be too much for many utilities to handle. Town turns sewer water into drinking water . Three facts hammer home the scary status of the nation's water infrastructure: . • The nation averages about 700 water main breaks nationwide each day, according to the EPA. • U.S. water utilities lose an average of about 10% of their water -- worth $2.8 billion per year -- through leaks and other causes, according the EPA. • The American Society of Civil Engineers grades the water infrastructure at a D minus. ""We've gotten so good at capturing and transporting water that we've really started to take it for granted,"" said Alex Prud'homme, author of ""The Ripple Effect,"" about the nation's declining water infrastructure. ""We had better start looking ahead and repairing our water infrastructure, because with the pressure from climate change, population growth, shifting demographics and the way we use water, the problem is only going to get worse rather than better."" Skyrocketing water bills mystify, anger residents . Searching for answers with technology . Inside a control room in the nation's capital, not far from the Potomac River, experts are hoping technology will solve this problem. The room is filled with multiple monitors displaying brightly colored graphs. ""It looks like we should be launching rockets into space,"" said George Hawkins, general manager of Washington, D.C.'s Water and Sewer Authority. The room helps stand guard over the city's 13,000 miles of water pipes and 42,000 valves. Strategically placed sensors detect leaks ranging from a trickle to full-blown water main bursts. Data about the breach are sent from these sensors to the control room, and technicians respond immediately. This allows the utility to more quickly and easily identify aging pipes and valves before they blow. ""The highest cost we face is digging up the street on an emergency basis any time of day or night -- often overtime,"" Hawkins said. The cost of replacing these aging systems is stunning. Hawkins recalls a major water main break last year along the National Mall that flooded parts of buildings housing the Internal Revenue Service and Justice Department. The burst pipe buckled Constitution Avenue by about a foot and cost almost $1 million in repairs and restoration. Smart water meters have slashed monthly meter readings from $3 per customer to just pennies. When these meters show a spike in customer's water use, the utility sends an e-mail to alert customers that they may have a leak. The technology is credited with cutting water leaks from 36 percent to 22 percent, saving customers even more. ""Quadruple hit"" The Replacement Era is going to be expensive. The EPA estimated that between 2007 and 2027, drinking water utilities will have to invest $334 billion on new infrastructure. The problem is worsened by the timing of it all. There's budget-cutting talk at the local, state and federal level. Hawkins called it a ""quadruple hit."" ""I don't see that there's any way, other than rate increases for most cities given the size of the financial need,"" Hawkins said. ""If we're not able in parallel to demonstrate how we're efficiently using the dollars we're collecting, I think this industry is in for huge challenges with our customers."" Water officials in Pittsburgh are considering raising rates more than 13% for infrastructure improvements. In Cleveland, authorities increased water fees for the same reason. Leaders in Baltimore took similar action. ""With this increase, we can either stop drinking water, stop showering, stop doing the laundry or get out of the city,"" complained a reader on CNN affiliate WBAL's website. ""The mayor and City Council need to realize that we along with other homeowners are the tax base, and if we leave, they're up the creek!"" In Southern California, Los Angeles water officials are thinking about raising rates to replace thousands of miles of decaying water pipes. The city of Indianapolis is trying something different. Hoping to save yearly operating costs by combining utilities, the city shifted control of its water and sewer system to a not-for-profit trust that also runs the local natural gas. It will free up $425 million in city funds that could be used for other expenses. ""Taxpayers have been unwilling to look at the long-term,"" Prud'homme said. ""But taxes and water rates go to maintaining this very important infrastructure that we take for granted, and if you're not willing to pay those fees and taxes, then you'll eventually suffer the consequences."" National water dialogue . Those consequences, some warn, include shifting weather patterns due to global climate change. Hotter summers and fluctuating water levels in lakes and oceans due to climate change will damage water and sewer systems in the coming decades, according to a new report from the Natural Resources Defense Council. ""I'm not hearing any outrage,"" Prud'homme said. ""I kind of feel like the crazy person on the roof yelling and shouting and saying, 'hey, everybody we've got to wake up and pay attention to this,' especially when it comes to our dams and levees."" In a year that has seen historic flooding in several Midwestern and Southern states along the Ohio and Mississippi rivers, Prud'homme says, he thought the levee failures during Hurricane Katrina would have prompted more alarm about flood defenses. ""More than 100 levees are at risk of catastrophic failure,"" he said. ""And this is from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers."" Prud'homme fears that U.S. water issues are so threatening, sweeping policy changes are needed. He's calling for a national dialogue focusing on water infrastructure issues. ""We have no single federal office that's overseeing the nation's water supply,"" Prud'homme said. ""There aren't really any easy answers to this, but these are issues that we have to tackle.""","Heat wave blamed for water pipeline bursts from California to New York .
Experts: It's a sign that sweeping replacement is needed for U.S. water pipelines .
Cost of new water infrastructure $334 billion through 2027, EPA says .

"(CNN) -- Anthony Howe makes sculptures that refuse to stay still. His mammoth-sized, stainless steel kinetic sculptures twist, turn and transform their shape in ways that can call to mind anything from a giant squid to electrons buzzing around an atom's nucleus. The 59-year-old Utah-born artist says inspiration for the otherworldly monuments can come from almost anywhere: ""from low-tech sci-fi paraphernalia to microbiological or astronomical models."" ""Growing up, I was fortunate to have spent a lot of time in the ocean, in the water,"" he says. ""My father traveled a lot, we lived in eight different cities in the United States, so I was exposed to all kinds of things, besides books and whatnot."" Since 1994, the artist made his home on 10 acres of Orcas Island, Washington state, which now incorporate Howe's gallery and sculpture park. His new creation -- a 17 ft-tall spike with a rotating ring of steel arms (below) -- has just taken pride of place on the lawn, and you can watch it in action in the new video here. Howe has been making kinetic sculptures since 1990. After graduating art school, he spent five years in a house he built on a remote mountaintop in New Hampshire. It was there that he painted water colors of the landscape, but eventually grew bored. He got a job as a superintendent in a warehouse and moved to Manhattan. ""My job was mostly putting up steel shelving, so I was surrounded by steel. My painting continued to go nowhere and I realized that I had a lot of raw material in the steel shelving."" ""I also lived on the top of a roof, with lots of outdoor space, and had the idea of making things that spun in the wind -- and the rest is history, so they say."" Today, the (now extremely complex) sculptures begin life on a computer, where Howe makes a digital ""sketch"" in modeling software packages 3ds Max and Rhinoceros. Each component can be sent from the computer to a laser cutter which precisely carves out the curvilinear form. But there is still room for ideas to develop and change, he notes, as he finishes the components by hand, using traditional metalworking techniques. He says the ""harmony"" between the many different components is created by getting ""a very, very good balance"" -- with each component carefully set on its axis to ensure it will be equally affected by the force of the wind. In addition to the organic forms of underwater and plant life, Howe points to the illustrated books of 19th century author Jules Verne as early inspiration. Verne dreamed of nature-inspired helicopters and submarines -- before they were created in real life -- in adventure classics such as ""Journey to the center of the earth"" and ""Twenty thousand leagues under the sea."" Like these creations, Howe's works transform the organic movement of the natural world into cold steel -- yet they retain their own hypnotic mystery. ""I'm just making a lot of choices based on what looks right to me,"" he says simply. For Howe, knowing that others are beguiled by his works his creations is a source of happiness: . ""I definitely set out a long time ago to make these sculptures so that they would be pleasant and hopefully transport a person to a better place than they were before they saw it."" ""I know that that's the antithesis of what a lot of people want art to do, but I don't really care anymore. At this point, I'm very glad that people enjoy looking at them.""

"(CNN) -- In an age where many school children are ferried to school in their parents' SUV, the idea of having to swim to school over open ocean or wade through muddy mangrove swamps to get to class might seem part of a cruel and long-forgotten past. But in some of the fishing communities near Zamboanga City in the Philippines, swimming half a mile of open water in school uniform while carrying school books tied up in plastic bags on their heads is still a daily reality. ""Their bags notebooks and papers always get soaked. If we forget to put their things in a plastic bag we have to hang their things out later to dry,"" said Ruhayna Mawadi, the mother of one of the pupils at Talon Talon Elementary School. ""Many of the children don't graduate and that's very sad and hard for us -- we want them to graduate because it's for their future."" When Filipino blogger Jay Jaboneta, co-founder of Yellow Boat of Hope, learned about the situation on the sidelines of a conference in the southern Philippines province of Mindanao in 2010 he was shocked. ""It really disturbed me when I heard about it,"" said Jaboneta. ""Around Zamboanga they had to wade to school from their stilt houses where their parents are seaweed farmers. But when it was high tide, the water was six-feet high and they really had to swim."" He said further investigations revealed even worse conditions than these. ""There's a community in Masbate that lives on a small island where the school is on a big island 300 meters away separated by water that is 30-feet deep. Seven kids had to swim this stretch of water twice a day."" Getting to school at another remote community near Zamboanga del Sur required a three-hour walk around the snake-infested shoreline of a lake, even though the school was just 15 minutes by boat. Often a family's only boat would be out in open water fishing by 4am and still at sea at around 7am when the children began to go to school. ""We heard reports of some children in the past dying simply trying to get to school,"" Jaboneta said. His foundation now provides boats -- painted yellow to mimic the color of Filipino school buses -- for some six communities where the children used to swim to school. In total, the organization provides educational help to some 30 remote communities isolated by the geography of the Philippines; an archipelago of 7,107 islands. The foundation is not only an example of a group of concerned citizens coming together to make a difference, but shows the power of social media to effect change. Jaboneta said the project really sprang up out of one Facebook status he fired off after he heard about the situation at a bloggers' summit in Mindanao almost four years ago. ""I had one friend who contacted me who wanted to give money and it just started to grow from that,"" he said. Now the group focuses on a range of issues, from education and medical support to local ecology and sustainability. It has even branched out into other projects such as Adopt a Fisherman -- a scheme to build up the fishing fleet destroyed by Typhoon Bopha, the super typhoon that devastated Mindanao in 2012. The school boat program in Masbate, in particular, has been a stand out success for the foundation, where enrollments jumped from the seven exhausted swimmers that used to arrive each morning to 150 pupils that come by boat every day. He said that that a lot of their funds are now earmarked for adding new classrooms onto the schools. ""This issue is really close to my heart because I wasn't born to a rich or even middle class family -- I struggled when I was growing up -- so it really touched me to see how much these kids really wanted to go to school."" The Yellow Boat of Hope Foundation will soon be able to count a handful of college graduates among the alumni of its school boats program, showing the difference the addition of a simple wooden boat can make to the future of a whole community. ""In Zamboanga, we've got eight students at the state university doing their best to finish college and they'll be the first in their community to ever do that."" He said the project has been an education for many of his friends and colleagues who were raised in cities and communities where getting to school each day was taken for granted. ""Even if it took several hours by bus or even walking it is not as tough as these kids have it,"" he said. ""We often hear of kids that skip school to go swimming but here we've got kids swimming so that they can go to school."" Read more: Turning landfill scraps into chic .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Kenny Ortega choked up with emotion as he read aloud an e-mail he wrote days before Michael Jackson's death. ""He was like a lost boy,"" Ortega read. ""There still may be a chance he can rise to the occasion if we get him the help he needs."" The director of Jackson's comeback concerts testified for a third day Wednesday in the wrongful death trial of AEG Live, the promoter and producer of the This Is It tour. ""I'm not OK right now,"" Ortega told the judge. ""Can I have a second?"" Judge Yvette Palazuelos allowed Ortega to go alone into the jury room for several minutes before returning for more testimony. It was one of several times that Ortega shed tears during testimony that described a weak and paranoid Michael Jackson six days before his death, but a revived Michael Jackson in his last two days. Jackson's mother, who is suing AEG Live, also cried as she listened to Ortega. The Jacksons contend that AEG Live executives hired, retained or supervised Dr. Conrad Murray, who admitted to police he was giving the singer nightly infusions of propofol. The coroner ruled Jackson's June 25, 2009, death was the result of an overdose of the surgical anesthetic, which Murray said he was using to treat Jackson's insomnia. Murray was convicted of involuntary manslaughter. AEG Live lawyers argue Jackson chose and controlled Murray, and their executives had no way of knowing about the dangerous treatments he was giving Jackson in the privacy of the entertainer's bedroom. But, according to testimony and e-mails, AEG Live execs put Murray in charge of Jackson's rehearsal schedule after Ortega complained that Jackson had been missing so many rehearsals that the tour was in danger. Jackson lawyers argued that Murray was influenced by a conflict of interest -- created by his arrangement with AEG Live -- to continue dangerous propofol infusions to help Jackson rest for rehearsals. He was $1 million in debt and had abandoned his medical practice two months earlier to serve as Jackson's personal physician for the tour. If he failed to get Jackson to rehearsals, the shows might be postponed or canceled and he would be out of a job, they argue. Ortega: ""I felt that we should stop"" After a poor rehearsal on June 13, 2009, and a missed rehearsal the next day, Ortega expressed his concern in an e-mail to AEG Live co-CEO Paul Gongaware: ""Were you aware that MJ's Doctor didn't permit him to attend rehearsals yesterday? Are Randy and Frank (DiLeo, another Jackson manager) aware of this? Please have them stay on top of his health situation without invading MJ's privacy. It might be a good idea to talk with his Doctor to make sure everything MJ requires is in place."" The AEG Live executives later told him they met with Murray and put him in charge of getting Jackson to rehearsals, Ortega said. The director said he was told that if he needed to know whether Jackson was coming to a rehearsal, he should call the doctor. Ortega was given Murray's cell phone number, which he said he programmed into his own phone. Conrad Murray: Fast Facts . After Jackson was a no-show for another week, Ortega had a 30-minute conversation with Murray. ""I was told he was creating the schedule and the schedule wasn't working,"" Ortega testified. ""He was my lifeline, so to speak."" Ortega said he was venting his frustrations with Jackson and was ""crying out."" While Jackson showed up on June 19, ""he appeared lost, cold, afraid,"" Ortega said. ""I saw a Michael that frightened me, a Michael that was shivering and cold,"" Ortega testified. ""I thought there was something emotional going on, deeply emotional, and something physical going on. He seemed fragile."" He persuaded Jackson not to go onstage that night because he was afraid he would hurt himself, he testified. Instead, Jackson agreed to watch the rehearsal with choreographer Travis Payne dancing his parts. Jackson appeared paranoid and afraid, he said. ""He was repeating for me not to quit or to leave him. He was afraid that I was going to quit or leave him."" With just a dozen days left for rehearsals before the touring company moved to London for the opening, Ortega testified, he was worried ""that all that we had worked for together, Michael and I -- this dream, this desire -- was going to fall away."" Ortega testified that on June 19, he ""felt that we should stop"" the production, but he was ""torn because I did not want to break Michael's heart."" Ortega sent a series of e-mails that night and the next morning to AEG Live executives warning that they needed professional help for Jackson. Promoter grilled about 'smoking gun' e-mail in Jackson death trial . ""There are strong signs of paranoia, anxiety and obsessive-like behavior,"" Ortega wrote. ""I think the very best thing we can do is get a top psychiatrist in to evaluate him ASAP. It's like there are two people there. One (deep inside) trying to hold on to what he was and still can be and not waiting us to quit him, the other in this weakened and troubled state."" Ortega testified that he was called to a meeting with AEG Live CEO Randy Phillips, Jackson and Murray at Jackson's home on June 20, hours after he sent those e-mails. Murray angrily confronted him, Ortega testified. ""He said I had no right to not let Michael rehearse, that Michael was physically and emotionally capable of handling all his responsibility as a performer and I should be a director and not an amateur doctor or psychologist. I should stick to my job and leave the rest to him."" Jackson died while under Murray's care five days later, in a bedroom just upstairs from the parlor where the meeting took place. ""A metamorphosis"" A much different Jackson appeared at the next scheduled rehearsal on June 23. ""It was miraculous,"" Ortega testified. ""I was overjoyed at his energy, his state of mind, his enthusiasm,"" he said. ""He had a metamorphosis. It was pretty extraordinary."" Murray told investigators he stopped using propofol to induce Jackson's sleep for the two previous nights -- after 60 nights of it. Jackson lawyers contend that is why Jackson was revitalized. Ortega said Jackson appeared to have gotten ""real sleep, organic sleep."" A sleep expert testified last month that someone can recover quickly from heavy use of propofol, which interrupts the normal sleep cycles. All of the symptoms that Ortega saw in Jackson on June 19 suggested Jackson had been deprived of real sleep for weeks, the expert said. Expert: Michael Jackson went 60 days without real sleep . Jurors watched a video of ""Earth Song,"" the final song Jackson performed at the June 24 rehearsal -- his last. ""I love this piece,"" Ortega said as he watched. ""Our boy is gone"" Ortega was standing on the Staples Center stage in Los Angeles the next day when he got a call from AEG Live Co-CEO Paul Gongaware telling him Jackson was dead. ""Our boy is gone"" Gongaware told him, he said. ""I think I was in shock,"" Ortega said. ""I wanted to believe that it was some weirdo on the phone."" Ortega, who had worked with Jackson on other tours and projects, testified Tuesday that he would have been less likely to agree to direct This Is It if he had known what happened the day Jackson was to appear in London to announce the tour. AEG Live CEO Randy Phillips testified last month that he ""slapped"" and ""screamed"" at Jackson because he was ""nerve-racked"" on that day, March 5, 2009. Phillips recounted that it was ""a miracle"" that a ""drunk and despondent"" Jackson finally appeared at the London event. AEG was hosting thousands of Jackson fans and hundreds of journalists for the anticipated announcement, which was to be seen live around the world. ""I screamed at him so loud the walls were shaking,"" Phillips wrote to AEG parent company CEO Tim Leiweke. ""Tohme (Jackson's manager) and I have dressed him, and they are finishing his hair, and then we are rushing to the O2. This is the scariest thing I have ever seen. He's an emotionally paralyzed mess, filled with self-loathing and doubt now that it is show time. He is scared to death. Right now I just want to get through this press conference."" AEG exec feared Michael Jackson would sabotage his comeback tour . AEG Live executives did not tell Ortega about the incident when they approached him days later to direct the show, he said. He would have been ""less likely"" to accept the job had he known, because of his concern about how the preparation for the tour would affect Jackson emotionally and physically, he said. Taj Jackson, Michael Jackson's oldest nephew, returns to the witness stand Thursday morning to continue his testimony begun last month. The trial, which is in its 11th week, is expected to conclude sometime in August. The Jackson lawyers said they should call their last witness next week, which would be followed by AEG Live presenting its defense.","NEW: Kenny Ortega described a weak and paranoid Michael Jackson six days before his death .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Kenny Ortega, the director of Michael Jackson's aborted comeback show, began his testimony Monday about what AEG Live executives did and said in Jackson's final days. His first hours on the stand Monday afternoon were spent discussing Jackson's creativity, saying his voice, songs and dancing were ""like no one else in his generation."" He will return Tuesday to resume his testimony. Lawyers for Jackson's mother and children argue in the wrongful death trial against AEG Live that those executives ignored warning signs about his health and mental condition that, if heeded, could have saved his life. The lawsuit contends the promoters hired, retained or supervised Dr. Conrad Murray, the physician convicted of involuntary manslaughter in Jackson's propofol overdose death. AEG Live lawyers argue that Jackson -- not their executives -- chose and controlled the doctor, who was giving him nightly infusions of the surgical anesthetic in a desperate search for sleep in his last two months. Ortega, who knew Jackson well and worked with him closely preparing his ""This Is It"" shows, sounded a warning to AEG Live CEO Randy Phillips in an e-mail on June 20, 2009 -- five days before Jackson's death -- that Ortega did not think the entertainer would be ready for the shows.

Tabloid report on Jackson 'FBI files' questioned . Expert: MJ was 'drug dependent,' not addicted . AEG says Jackson was secretive about his drug use, which the company contends was an addiction, so there was no way of knowing what treatments Murray was giving Jackson in his bedroom. But a drug addiction expert testified last week that there was ""not a lot of evidence to support"" the belief that Michael Jackson was addicted to drugs. If he was an addict, Jackson ""would be taking drugs that were not prescribed by a medical professional, taking larger amounts than prescribed and have drug-seeking behavior,"" Dr. Sidney Schnoll testified. There was no evidence Jackson ever took drugs that were not given to him by a doctor or that he took more than prescribed, Schnoll said. The bottles of sedatives found in his home after his death had more pills remaining in them than he would have expected if Jackson was an addict, Schnoll said. This ""indicated these were not being taken on a regular basis,"" he said. Evidence shows Jackson sought drugs from a number of doctors, but that was not inappropriate because he needed them ""to treat a legitimate medical problem,"" including back pain, scalp pain and dermatologic issues, Schnoll testified. While not addicted, Jackson was dependent on drugs, he said. The painkillers that forced Jackson to end his 1993 ""Dangerous"" tour early so he could enter a rehab program were taken to relieve the pain from scalp surgery needed to repair burns suffered when filming a Pepsi commercial, Schnoll said. The burns left scars on damaged nerves in his scalp, which becomes ""excitable tissue"" that ""can be firing just like the nerve,"" he said. The result ""can be every painful, like a burning kind of pain -- persistent, sharp, shooting kind of pain,"" he said. ""It's very uncomfortable and one of the most difficult to treat."" Pain relief is a legitimate use of opioid drugs and a person can function normally if they are taken under a doctor's care, he said. Prince, Blanket Jackson celebrate dad's life amid death trial . President John Kennedy was opioid dependent to relieve ""very severe back pain"" while in the White House, he said. ""He did alright as president?"" Jackson lawyer Michael Koskoff asked.

The Demerol injections Jackson got during frequent visits to a Beverly Hills dermatologist between April and his death in late June 2009 were given for legitimate medical reasons, Schnoll testified. If he were addicted to Demerol -- which is a powerful opioid -- he would not have gone 43 days between injections, which medical records show, he said. Jackson also went roughly 13 years -- from 1993 until 2008 -- without the drug, he said. The doctor conceded under cross-examination by an AEG Live lawyer, however, that a gap in available medical records may be misleading. Jackson's use of sedatives was an effort to treat his chronic insomnia, Schnoll said. If the underlying sleep problem could be resolved, the chances of ending Jackson's use of the drugs would have been good, he said. There was no indication that Jackson was addicted to propofol before Murray began giving him nightly infusions of the surgical anesthetic for 60 days leading up to his death, he said. Nephew: Jackson was murdered . Unheeded warning signs? Ortega, in his e-mail to AEG Live CEO Phillips on June 20, wrote that ""I honestly don't think he is ready for this based on his continued physical weakening and deepening emotional state."" He said Jackson was having trouble ""grasping the work"" at rehearsals. Production manager John ""Bugzee"" Hougdahl wrote in an e-mail to Phillips hours earlier that Ortega had sent Jackson home from a rehearsal that night because of his strange behavior. ""I have watched him deteriorate in front of my eyes over the last 8 weeks. He was able to do multiple 360 spins back in April. He'd fall on his ass if he tried now,"" Hougdahl wrote. ""He was a basket case and Kenny was concerned he would embarrass himself on stage, or worse yet -- get hurt. The company is rehearsing right now, but the DOUBT is pervasive."" Phillips replied to Ortega: ""Please stay steady. Enough alarms have sounded. It is time to put out the fire, not burn the building down."" By ""burn the building down,"" he meant pulling the plug on the tour that was set to begin in three weeks, Phillips testified last month. ""In a highly charged situation like this, I just wanted to keep things calm until we could have the meeting."" Phillips met with Murray, Jackson and Ortega at Jackson's home later that day. While Jackson lawyers argue that meeting was intended to pressure Murray to make sure Jackson was ready for rehearsals, AEG lawyers contend Murray assured producers nothing was wrong. Phillips testified that he remembered little about the conversation at the meeting and Murray has invoked his constitutional protection against self-incrimination to avoid testifying in the trial. This makes Ortega's testimony crucial for both sides. 'They're going to kill me,' Jackson told son . Hand over evidence or face jail . A related drama could unfold Monday in another courtroom as a judge in Ohio decides if he'll carry out a threat to throw the widow and daughter of a former Jackson manager in jail for refusing to hand over a laptop computer subpoenaed by Jackson lawyers. Frank DiLeo, who served as Jackson's manager decades earlier, reappeared in his life in his last months. He died in 2011. Jackson lawyers want to search his laptop for evidence to support their contention that DiLeo was beholden to the concert promoter and not to Jackson. His daughter, Belinda DiLeo, refused a judge's order last week to disclose where the computer was, prompting the contempt of court order. The judge gave the DiLeo's until Monday to hand it over or face jail. A hearing will be held Wednesday to determine of the women complied with the order. Jackson changed managers twice in the last three months of his life. In late March 2009, he hired Leonard Rowe -- one of his father's friends -- to replace Tohme Tohme, the manager who initially negotiated the deal with AEG for his ""This Is It"" tour. Jackson lawyers argue that AEG Live forced Jackson to take DiLeo, who had worked for him off and on for decades, as his manager in May 2009 because they did not want to work with Rowe. A cache of 5,000 e-mails has already been recovered and a lawyer in Ohio is reviewing them to redact non-relevant and personal information before handing them over to Jackson lawyers.","Kenny Ortega worked closely with Michael Jackson in his last weeks .

"(CNN) -- She was only crowned Miss Universe Thailand on Saturday but Weluree ""Fai"" Ditsayabut has already become caught up in the political crisis engulfing her country, after comments were found on her Facebook page referring to pro-government demonstrators as ""dirty,"" ""evil activists"" that should ""all be executed."" According to news site Khaosod English, the 22-year-old has often published scathing comments about the ""red shirt"" movement on her Facebook page, which now appears to have been deleted. ""I am not neutral. I am on the side of His Majesty the King,"" Weluree said in a comment from November, Khaosod English reported. ""I'm so angry at these evil activists. They should all be executed."" Weluree reportedly said Thailand would be cleaner if the ""dirty"" red shirts left the country. Pro-government supporters have questioned Weluree's pageant victory on popular online forums and social media sites. A Facebook page in protest of her winning the competition had over 10,000 ""likes"" on Monday -- although some users criticized her appearance and claimed she won because of her connections, rather than raising concerns about her anti-red shirt comments. The deputy director of Human Rights Watch's Asia division, Phil Robertson, condemned Weluree's remarks on Twitter. ""Perhaps (a) better title is Miss Politically Divided #Thailand? Shameful when beauty queens are calling for executions,"" he wrote. Weluree -- an actress, talk show host, and English student -- apologized Monday for the remarks in an interview on Thailand's Channel 3. ""I was careless. I was young. I did it recklessly,"" she said. ""It won't happen again."" Weluree beat the pageant favorite Pimbongkod ""Ellie"" Chankaew who placed second in Saturday's competition. The pageant organizers have not responded to the controversy, nor have the leaders of the pro-government movement. Thailand's political turmoil began in November when the government attempted to pass a controversial amnesty bill that would have cleared the way for the return of then-prime minister Yingluck Shinawatra's brother, Thaksin, to politics. The former prime minister and tycoon has been living in self-imposed exile to avoid a corruption conviction after being overthrown in a military coup in 2006. Since November, the People's Democratic Reform Committee has led anti-government protesters, who are mostly middle-class royalists, in calling for Yingluck's government to be replaced with an unelected ""people's council."" Competing rallies have been held by pro-government supporters, many of whom come from the country's rural north and northeast and view Shinawatra's ouster as a ""judicial coup."" Yingluck was found guilty of abuse of power and removed from office along with several cabinet ministers on May 7, and indicted by Thailand's anti-graft body. If the Senate votes to impeach her, she could be banned from politics for five years. Monday marks a particularly sensitive day for the red shirt movement as the anniversary of a military crackdown that left more than 90 people dead and thousands injured in 2010.

"(CNN) -- Miguel Angel Jimenez boasts arguably the most eye-catching warmup routine in golf: arms outstretched with a club above his head, squatting, usually with a cigar protruding from his mouth. Known as ""The Mechanic,"" his routine is clearly not in need of fixing -- on Sunday the Spaniard became the first man over the age of 50 to win on the European Tour. His first victory at his home tournament, the Spanish Open, came at his 27th attempt following a three-way playoff against Australian Richard Green and Thomas Pieters of Belgium. While many of his peers are constantly pounding around in the gyms getting ready for the major tournaments, Jimenez's approach is more alternative. ""I love to ski (he broke his leg doing so in 2012), I love to drink, I love to smoke, I love to compete and I love to have time with my friends,"" he said. ""I don't want to stop any of those things. I'm sorry but I'm honest. ""I do what I like in my life and I'm not going to change that. If a major is coming then it will be 'wow' but, if the major is not coming, I'm still going to do what I like with my life."" It is an approach that has brought out the best in him in his advancing years in the sport. Of his 21 career wins on the European Tour, two-thirds of them have come in the last 10 years. The latest one, which he clinched on the first playoff hole, eclipsed his previous record for the oldest winner on the European Tour at December's Hong Kong Open, which came less than a month before his 50th birthday. Now into his sixth decade, he is targeting yet more records. The first is to become the oldest European Ryder Cup player in September's clash with the U.S. -- which would beat a milestone set back in 1927 by Ted Ray, who was 50 years, two months and five days old when he captained Great Britain in the inaugural event. Also, should Jimenez win a major title -- he came close with his fourth place at last month's Masters -- he would beat the record of Julius Boros, winner of the 1968 U.S. PGA Championship aged 48. ""I would love to make the Ryder Cup team,"" admitted Jimenez, who is now sixth in the European points list as he seeks to reclaim his place, having been a non-playing vice-captain for 2012's ""Miracle at Medinah."" ""I would break all the records at 50."" As for this weekend's victory, he added: ""There's no words to describe what it means to me. You need to be into my skin but I'm not going to let you. It's amazing. ""All the victories are special, all are unique, some of them give you more money, some less, but all of them are important. You play to win and when you make it you have to appreciate it."" Jimenez has no plans yet to become a fulltime member of the seniors' circuit, though he won his debut event on the U.S. Champions Tour last month and has said he is likely to line up at July's Senior British Open at Royal Porthcawl a week after the third regular major of the season at Hoylake. ""I love to compete,"" he said. ""It's the only think I know how to do properly in my life.""","Miguel Angel Jimenez wins home Spanish Open for first time .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Jurors deciding if a concert promoter is liable in Michael Jackson's death will return for a fourth day of deliberations Wednesday. The panel of 12 worked nearly 11 hours since closing arguments Thursday without reaching a verdict, a fact that might offer encouragement to the lawyers for Jackson's mother and three children. A ""no"" decision on the first of 16 questions on their verdict form -- Did AEG Live hire Dr. Conrad Murray -- would have immediately ended the trial without a need to consider the remaining 15 questions that concern negligence and damages. If they've already completed work on the first question in nearly 11 hours of deliberations, it would represent a major hurdle for the Jacksons' case in the five-month-long wrongful death trial. Katherine Jackson and her grandchildren Prince, Paris and Blanket contend AEG Live is responsible for the pop icon's death because it negligently hired, retained or supervised the doctor convicted in his death. Jackson died of an overdose of the surgical anesthetic propofol, which Dr. Conrad Murray told investigators he was using to treat the singer's insomnia so he could rest for rehearsals. Murray is set to be released from jail later this month after serving two years for involuntary manslaughter. The death happened just days before Jackson's comeback tour -- promoted and produced by AEG Live -- was set to debut in London in the summer of 2009. Question No. 1 . Did AEG Live hire Murray? The company's lawyers contend Jackson chose Murray, who had treated him for three years as a family physician, but Jackson lawyers argue the promoters chose to negotiate their own contract with the doctor so they could control him. A so-called ""smoking gun"" e-mail sent by AEG Live Co-CEO Paul Gongaware 11 days before Jackson died said, ""We want to remind (Murray) that it is AEG, not MJ, who is paying his salary. We want to remind him what is expected of him."" The Jacksons also point to a television interview soon after Jackson died in which AEG Live CEO Randy Phillips said AEG Live ""hired"" Murray. If jurors say yes to the hiring question, deliberations then turn to the questions of negligence. Were AEG Live executives negligent in dealing with Murray and did their negligence contribute significantly to Jackson's death? AEG Live lawyers argue they had no way of knowing that Murray -- licensed to practice in four states and never sued for malpractice -- was a risk to Jackson. The singer was a secretive drug addict who kept even his closest relatives in the dark about his use of propofol to sleep, they contend. Jackson lawyers contend the company's agreement with Murray created a medical conflict of interest that led him to break his Hippocratic Oath to do no harm. Murray, who was $1 million in debt, was pressured to deliver the risky treatments or else possibly lose the $150,000 monthly salary, they argue. Executives ignored a series of warning signs that Jackson was at risk in his last weeks, including deteriorating health that included weight loss, inability to perform his trademark dances or remember lyrics to his standard songs, and paranoia, the Jacksons argue. A sleep expert testified that the nightly propofol infusions robbed Jackson of vital REM sleep, which caused the deterioration. Blame and damages . If jurors reach a decision that AEG Live is liable, then they'll consider other questions to determine how much in damages the promoter must pay Katherine, Prince, Paris and Blanket Jackson. Jackson lead lawyer Brian Panish suggested a range between $1 billion and $2 billion to replace the earnings lost by Jackson's death at age 50 and the non-economic -- or personal -- damages from the loss of a father and son. The damage award, however, would be reduced by the percentage of blame jurors decide Michael Jackson shares in his death. The Jackson lawyer suggested in closing arguments Thursday that they assigned 20% of the liability to Jackson. Engaged jurors . Jurors appeared engaged and entertained through 21 weeks of the trial, which included dramatic testimony by Jackson's mother, son and former wife. Several jurors even applauded at the end of testimony by famed choreographer-director Kenny Ortega. Their first notes to the judge Friday indicated that Juror No. 6 had been chosen as presiding juror -- or foreman. He is a high school physical education teacher who heads to the football field after each day of court to coach a team. They also asked for 12 copies of the written contract AEG Live sent to Murray, a copy of the ""This Is It"" film -- which documents Jackson's last rehearsals -- and a DVD player. A Jackson lawyer suggested outside of court that it would be a good sign for his side If deliberations last more than a few days -- since it indicates jurors have moved past the key initial questions. CNN's camera will be in the courtroom when a verdict is read. Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Yvette Palazuelos approved the network's request last week to televise the closing arguments and verdict. She refused a request in April to allow cameras in court for the opening and testimony phase.","NEW: Jurors deliberate nearly 11 hours over 3 days .

"(CNN) -- The chance to run a marathon through the capital city of the world's most mysterious country was too good an opportunity to pass up. So, when the 27th annual Mangyongdae Prize Marathon, held in Pyongyang last weekend, was thrown open to amateur runners from outside North Korea for the first time, I made sure I had packed my running gear. Officials said that runners from 27 foreign countries took part, but the experience wasn't just unique for the few of us who had made the trip. From the moment we arrived in the reclusive Stalinist state, we were met with a mixture of fascinated stares and wary expressions. Outside the imposing Kim II Sung stadium, where the race began, we had the chance to have our photos taken with spectators and North Korean runners alike. Posing with the race's local contestants really emphasized the stark contrast between the Koreans and us -- while we were kitted out in all manner of fluorescent brand-name sports gear, the North Koreans wore drab kits and ancient, battered running shoes. Before the start gun, all 1,000 racers -- local, foreign, amateur and professional -- paraded through a capacity crowd of 50,000 spectators inside the stadium. Expressions in the crowd were a mixture of smiles and bemusement, with no shortage of laughter at how out of place the tourists looked as we struggled to keep in formation. Two worlds . The look of wonderment was mutual, as we cautiously waved at the crowds who replied with cheers and waves of their own. At this point my pre-race nerves were overtaken by the surreal realization that I was taking part in the DPRK's foremost athletics event. During the short opening ceremony and as we prepared to set off, runners were told not to take any photos. Good thing too, as we endured one false start -- much to the hilarity of the crowd and the obvious displeasure of race officials. The course allowed us an up-close and personal view of the streets of Pyongyang, as well as its residents. Plenty of high fives, ""hellos"" and ""anneyongs"" (Korean for ""hi"") were exchanged between runners and spectators, as well as the ubiquitous puzzled looks. Unlike most distance running events, there were no barriers along the way and no sponsorship billboards -- essentially we were just out running the streets, directed around the course by race officials. Close up, the only way to describe Pyongyang is as though it's stuck in a 60s time warp. The real Pyongyang . I thought we might have only run on the grandest and smartest streets in the city, but in reality we took some pretty uninspiring roads past some very dismal and empty-looking tower blocks. Unlike other marathons I'd attended in China and the UK, this race lacked facilities such as portable toilets. Instead, certain buildings that lined the route were designated runners' toilets -- some were actually located on the second floor of buildings and as far as 50 meters from the road. As we ran through the streets of the city we got a close up view of North Korean urban society. Row after row of expressionless uniformed soldiers marching in unison, right behind groups of giggling school children waving to us, as well as weather-beaten faces of the older generation, who occasionally showed us a toothless grin. Unlike inside of the stadium, the crowds seemed to be regular residents, although it's worth remembering that Pyongyang resident are the very upper echelons of North Korean society. ""I think it's a rare chance to observe and interact with North Koreans even if you're running through a planned route,"" Alexandra Wu, from Canada but living in Beijing, told me after the race. ""I almost feel like I bonded with the locals... even if just to a very small extent."" Unique running event . Before the race itself, there had been some confusion over the cut-off time for the marathon, ranging from three and a half to four hours. I made it round in a little over four, by which time the course had become very sparse. This meant that for some stretches I was actually running alone on a Pyongyang street a few feet from workers passing by on rickety bicycles and elderly women hand in hand with their grandchildren. Had I been a few minutes slower I wouldn't actually have been allowed to officially cross the finish line in the stadium -- a few behind me didn't manage to complete the race in time, despite having already run so far. This is quite different to major city marathons where runners are often allowed up to seven or eight hours. Sadly, I wasn't able get a picture perfect finish side by side with a North Korean -- they'd all finished well ahead of me -- but I did get 50,000 Korean spectators in the stadium cheering me across the line. It symbolized what was, from start to finish, a good-natured event and demonstrated the unifying quality of sport, particularly one as universal as running. The event is by no means a fun-run, as the four hour cut-off time might suggest. Only about 30 foreign amateurs went for the full marathon, and it seemed like each amateur Korean was there to race. There weren't any runners in ridiculous costumes, or TV cameras to document it or taking part medals for runners, but given the circumstances this is to be expected. In terms of city marathons the scale was very small, but it was well organized. Bizarre, fascinating experience . ""For me it was a uniquely bizarre, fascinating experience,"" Jasmine, a Beijing-based American runner told me. ""Obviously we are getting a one-sided view of the country but it's at least one perspective, one glimpse into the country. Meeting just one friendly foreigner, one conversation can have a big impression. And I must say that the guides were amazing and I greatly value the candid conversations I was able to have with them.""","Amateur foreign runners invited to 27th annual Mangyongdae Prize Marathon for the first time .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Michael Jackson's mother will be called back to testify by AEG Live as its last witness in their defense of Katherine Jackson's wrongful-death lawsuit on Monday, an AEG Live lawyer said Wednesday. AEG Live lead attorney Marvin Putnam said he would question the 83-year-old Jackson family matriarch ""about the absurdity of the damages"" she wants the jury to award if they decide the concert promoter is liable in the pop icon's death. A Jackson lawyer argued that AEG Live's ""intent is to show the lawsuit's purpose is greed,"" while the judge suggested that any mother could be expected to say ""there is no amount of money that would substitute for the loss of her son."" Putnam has frequently cited in interviews a ""statement of damages"" letter sent to him by a Jackson lawyer last year capping possible damages at $40 billion, but the judge ruled that he could not refer to it in court because it was not a sworn filing in the case. Jackson lawyer Kevin Boyle pointed out that the lawsuit complaint only says that damages would be ""according to proof at trial,"" based on testimony by several expert witnesses who have testified. Katherine Jackson and grandchildren Prince, Paris and Blanket contend that AEG Live is liable in the singer's death because it negligently hired, retained or supervised Dr. Conrad Murray, who was convicted of involuntary manslaughter. AEG Live argues that Jackson chose and controlled Murray and that its executives had no way of knowing about the dangerous treatments he was giving him in his bedroom. Jackson expert Arthur Erk -- a certified public accountant who has managed and audited the business affairs of many top artists -- testified that he was ""reasonably certain"" that Jackson would have earned at least $1.5 billion from touring, endorsements and sponsorships had he not died from a propofol overdose preparing for his comeback tour. ""It is very difficult to assess the value of the King of Pop,"" Jackson lawyer Deborah Chang told the judge Wednesday. ""How do you even do that?"" The non-economic damages suffered because of Michael Jackson's death could be enormous considering ""what happened to Paris Jackson,"" she said. Jackson's 15-year-old daughter attempted suicide in June and remains in a treatment program. The $40 billion estimate made last year was not a court filing but was a ""best guess"" before the expert reports were completed, Chang said. Jackson lawyers seemed to welcome the prospect of AEG Live calling their client as their final witness, considering how jurors reacted when she was on the stand in July. Jurors leaned forward and paid close attention during her two days of testimony as the last witness in their case. ""Why are you here?"" Jackson lawyer Brian Panish asked her. ""Because I want to know what really happened to my son,"" she said. ""And that's why I am here."" Panish asked Jackson how it made her feel to be asked probing and personal questions about her family by AEG Live lawyer Marvin Putnam. ""It makes me feel real bad, because my son was a very good person,"" she said. ""He loved everybody. He gave to charity. He was in the Guinness Book of World Records for giving to charity."" in July, she told jurors she filed the wrongful death lawsuit against AEG Live ""because I want to know what really happened to my son."" If jurors decide that AEG Live is liable in Jackson's death, they could award damages based on the loss of the mother's and children's relationship with him and the amount of money he was unable to earn because his life was cut short. After AEG Live rests its case -- which lawyers indicated would happen Monday -- the Jackson lawyers would have a chance to call several rebuttal witnesses. Closing arguments in the trial, which began in April, could be heard as soon as next week.","AEG LIve lawyers want another chance to question Katherine Jackson in death trial .

"Galesburg, Illinois (CNN) -- President Barack Obama vowed Wednesday to focus his energy for the rest of his presidency on the core tenet of his election victories -- equal opportunity for all Americans -- starting with campaign-style speeches on the economy that appeared to launch this year's budget battle with Republicans. Confronting the deep partisan divide over federal spending, tax reform and raising the debt ceiling later this year, Obama told a large crowd at the University of Central Missouri in Warrensburg that reversing a growing inequality between haves and have-nots should be the top priority of Congress. He chastised Congress for inaction and vowed to take matters into his own hands during the remaining 1,276 days he has in office. ""Where I can act on my own, I'm going to. I'm not going to wait for Congress,"" he said in the second of two speeches that kicked off a series of economic-themed addresses across the country. It was a sentiment he expressed earlier in the day during a speech to hundreds at Knox College in Galesburg, Illinois. ""This growing inequality isn't just morally wrong; it's bad economics,"" Obama said. During the speech at Knox College, he blended populist imagery from his campaign stump speech last year with the criticism of conservative Republicans who, according to the president, only stood for repealing his signature 2010 health care reform law and slashing federal spending in an effort to shrink government. ""Repealing Obamacare and cutting spending is not an economic plan. It's not,"" Obama said, challenging the political right to work with him on budget and tax polices that promote economic fairness for all, especially the middle class and people aspiring to join it. Gearing up for health care exchanges: Crunch time for Obamacare . His voice rising, Obama declared that ""the one thing I care about is how to use every minute of the remaining 1,276 days of my term to make this country work for working Americans again."" As the audience stood to applaud and cheer, he added: ""That's all I care about. I don't have another election."" Earlier Wednesday, White House spokesman Jay Carney acknowledged to CNN that a goal of Obama's speeches was to ratchet up pressure on Republicans to work with Democrats and the president, noting that ""in the end, members of Congress respond to their constituents."" Republicans called Obama's speeches a retread strategy that lacked fresh ideas to further bolster an economy that everyone agrees should be growing faster. ""We've heard most of it before,"" GOP Sen. Richard Shelby of Alabama told CNN, adding that Obama's economic policies had failed. ""He's a good politician,"" Shelby said of Obama, noting that the president was telling people what they wanted to hear. ""But he's not doing what he needs to do to create good jobs."" Despite slow but steady growth over the past four years, polls show many Americans are still concerned about unemployment and the economy overall even though indicators show an improving recovery and Wall Street is again in record territory. Two new surveys on Wednesday indicated less than half of Americans approve of the president's handling of the economy. Both polls, by NBC News/Wall Street Journal and ABC News/Washington Post, found more respondents disapprove of how Obama has dealt with the economy, which remained the top issue for the public. The first six months of Obama's second term have been dominated by issues like gun violence and immigration reform, with legislation on both currently mired in partisan wrangling, as well as controversies such as Internal Revenue Service targeting of groups seeking tax-exempt status. Reframing political debate . His speeches Wednesday sought to reframe the political debate as the government approaches the end of its fiscal year on September 30 and a potential shutdown if Congress fails to overcome the gridlock that has become its trademark. Knox College is where Obama delivered his first major economic address of his national political career eight years ago, and he used the setting to emphasize progress made since then in overcoming the recession his administration inherited to launch a slow but steady economic recovery. At the same time, Obama said the challenges and opportunities of the 21st century demanded new thinking and policies to capitalize on America's potential and end the pattern of worsening inequality from previous decades. He called for Washington to focus on ""rebuilding our manufacturing base, educating our workforce, upgrading our transportation systems, upgrading our information networks"" instead of what he labeled ""an endless parade of distractions, political posturing and phony scandals."" Obama was particularly tough on conservative House Republicans, whom he blamed for blocking progress on issues such as immigration reform agreed to by their GOP colleagues in the Senate. He said he would work with anyone with good ideas while using executive authority and calling on on business leaders, philanthropists, labor leaders -- ""anybody who can help"" -- to push for economic changes promoting equal opportunity. ""I will not allow gridlock or inaction or willful indifference to get in our way,"" Obama said. Later in the day, Obama headed to the University of Central Missouri in Warrensburg for another address expected to focus on education. Looming budget battle . Regardless of the political focus of recent months, the national debate was certain to focus on the federal budget this summer and fall. Pitched political battles over spending and taxes have dominated Obama's presidency, and Republican leaders spurred on by conservative House Republicans facing congressional elections next year are threatening hardline negotiating tactics over the budget and affiliated issues of tax reform and forced spending cuts known as sequestration that took effect this year. Both the Republican-majority House and Democratic-majority Senate have passed spending proposals for fiscal year 2014, but the measures bear little resemblance to each other in terms of priorities. Any attempt to reconcile differences through negotiation faces complications from related issues such as whether the sweeping government spending cuts that took effect in March and hit the military and discretionary accounts hard should continue unchanged. Another potential landmine is the opposition by conservative Republicans, including some GOP leaders in Congress, to funding the implementation of the health care reform law pushed through by Democrats with Obama's backing in 2010. Further complicating the debate is the certain need for Congress to authorize an increase in the government's borrowing limit, or debt ceiling, sometime this fall. 'The Boehner rule' House Speaker John Boehner has made clear that any rise in the debt ceiling would require an equal cut in government spending to get GOP support, a demand known as the Boehner rule as set by the Ohio Republican. Opinion: Will Speaker Boehner make history? The White House has said it will not negotiate on the debt ceiling, and some congressional Republicans balk at linking it to specific demands, such as cuts in funds for implementing health care reform, but insist that more must be done to reduce deficits and debt. ""I think holding the debt limit a hostage to any specific thing is probably not the best negotiating place,"" GOP Sen. Roy Blunt of Missouri told MSNBC. ""Where we ought to be now is, we need more spending cuts."" Blunt specifically called for reforms to popular entitlement programs such as Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security to reduce their costs ""so they last."" However, Democrats and Republicans remain far apart on entitlements, long a target of conservatives seeking to shrink government, especially programs that they say lead to federal dependence. Democrats argue the government pension program and health care for the elderly and poor are part of a vital social contract that ensures the well-being of vulnerable citizens. Obama said Wednesday that Democrats must ""question old assumptions"" and ""be willing to redesign or get rid of programs that don't work as well as they should."" He has come under fire from some liberals for already proposing a change in how the annual cost-of-living index for federal benefits gets calculated as part of a broad but so far unreachable deficit reduction deal with Republicans.

"New York (CNN) -- USS Cole Cmdr. Dennis Farrell keeps in his cabin a memento of the last time the storied Navy destroyer cruised into New York Harbor. It was Fleet Week 2000. Sailors stood at the rails under a fluttering American flag. In the background, the Twin Towers soared over a shimmering skyline. ""It reminds me of why we go to sea,"" Farrell says of the keepsake photo. A few months later, on October 12, 2000, a pair of suicide bombers associated with al Qaeda nearly sank the Cole as it refueled in Aden harbor in Yemen. The attackers waved at the sailors. ""It was presumed to be a trash boat,"" Farrell says. ""It wasn't."" Resilient and strong . The bombers sidled their explosives-laden fishing boat alongside the $1 billion warship and ripped a 40-by-60-foot hole into its side, killing 17 sailors and wounding 37 more. Heralded by al Qaeda as one of its greatest military strikes, the attack foreshadowed the terror network's destruction of the World Trade Center in Manhattan less than a year later. ""We took a hit 11 months before 9/11, and we came back resilient, a strong force,"" Farrell says, ""like the men and women of New York."" The destroyer -- also known as DDG 67 -- left New York on Tuesday at the close of Fleet Week 2014. The World Trade Center site, with its hulking Freedom Tower, once again houses the nation's tallest building. On Wednesday, the same day the Cole headed the Fleet Week procession along the harbor, the long-awaited September 11 Memorial Museum opened to the public. A flotilla of smaller vessels, including New York Police and Fire Department boats, welcomed the ships. ""We're so closely connected to the men and women of New York,"" says Farrell, a native of Boca Raton, Florida. ""You see the outpouring of the emergency service members, the firefighters and the New York City Police Department."" In recent days, hundreds of schoolchildren and adults toured the Cole to learn about its history, weapons systems and return to duty two years and $250 million in repairs and upgrades after the attack. ""Right here is where the gash was,"" says U.S. Navy Ensign Hannah Taylor of Mount Pleasant, Iowa, standing near where 17 sailors having an early lunch were killed. Victims remembered . Nearby, in the ship's Hall of Heroes, 17 gold stars are inlaid on the mess deck to commemorate each victim. ""The sailors, you watch them when they're getting their chow, they don't step on those stars,"" Farrell says. ""They walk around them. And sailors are assigned to clean those stars every day. They take that very seriously."" Each victim is remembered on a plaque: . -- Hull Maintenance Technician 2nd Class Kenneth Eugene Clodfelter, 21. -- Electronics Technician Chief Petty Officer Richard Costelow, 35. -- Mess Management Specialist Seaman Lakeina Monique Francis, 19. -- Information Systems Technician Timothy Lee Gauna, 21. -- Signalman Seaman Cherone Louis Gunn, 22. -- Seaman James Rodrick McDaniels, 19. -- Engineman 2nd Class Marc Ian Nieto, 24. -- Electronics Warfare Technician 2nd Class Ronald Scott Owens, 24. -- Seaman Lakiba Nicole Palmer, 22. -- Engineman Fireman Joshua Langdon Parlett, 19. -- Fireman Patrick Howard Roy, 19. -- Electronics Warfare Technician 1st Class Kevin Shawn Rux, 30. -- Mess Management Specialist 3rd Class Ronchester Manangan Santiago, 22. -- Operations Specialist 2nd Class Timothy Lamont Saunders, 32. -- Fireman Gary Graham Swenchonis Jr., 26. -- Ensign Andrew Triplett, 31. -- Seaman Craig Bryan Wibberley, 19. In addition, placards with photos and short biographies about the victims are displayed near their workstations. ""Every single day you remember what those sailors died for,"" Taylor says. In the dining hall, the attack is commemorated with three glass cases. One has the still blackened flag that flew the day of the attack. Another, the flag that draped the coffins of the fallen crew members. A third holds the flag flown when the ship first returned to the Gulf of Aden. Courage and Heroism . In 2001, the Department of Defense issued a report on the USS Cole attack that cited significant shortcomings in security against terrorist attacks. ""The investigation clearly shows that the commanding officer of Cole did not have the specific intelligence, focused training, appropriate equipment or on-scene security support to effectively prevent or deter such a determined, preplanned assault,"" the Chief of Naval Operations, Adm. Vern Clark, said at the time. ""In short, the system -- all of us -- did not equip this Skipper for success in the environment he encountered in Aden harbor that fateful day."" The terror organization's success against the Cole ""galvanized al Qaeda's recruitment efforts,"" while the failure of the United States to retaliate against group leaders in Afghanistan motivated Osama bin Laden to ""launch something bigger,"" said the 9/11 Commission Report. Still, those stationed on the Cole speak of the heroism of members of the former crew, who worked for days to save the ship and care for the injured. In intense heat, they toiled without electrical power and no shipboard communication. ""On two occasions, it was very, very close to sinking,"" Farrell says. ""The ship had to pull together everybody regardless of what their specialty was ... for damage control."" He added, ""There is no question that this ship was saved by the men and women who were serving on the Cole in October 2000. That's not lost on me or any of my crew members. We stand on the shoulders of those who came before us."" All Navy recruits now undergo drills on the same type of ship as the Cole, putting out fires, dealing with flooding and tending to the wounded. Exercises occur in a structural model of the damaged Cole mess deck. ""We have a totally different mindset of how we do business, a totally different focus,"" Farrell says. Said Taylor, ""There's not really a drill that you can do for something that massive. Even when you have an actual fire or flooding, it's not nearly that bad. It would have taken a lot of courage and heroism to do what they did.""","Storied Navy destroyer visits New York for first time since 2000 suicide bombing .

"London (CNN) -- William Hague announced his resignation as Britain's foreign secretary, in what was perhaps the biggest surprise of a major government reshuffle by Prime Minister David Cameron. Hague, who has served in the role for four years, will be the leader of the House of Commons until next year's general election. Hague said he was proud of the work he had done in the Foreign Office but that he'd been involved in politics for a long time. He was first elected to Parliament in 1989 and, among other roles, led the Conservative Party in opposition from 1997 to 2001. ""Renewal in politics is good, and holding office is not an end in itself. After 26 years as an MP, time will be right for me to move on,"" he tweeted Monday. Cameron praised the contribution made by Hague. ""I'd like to pay an enormous tribute to (Hague), who is standing down as an MP at the next election,"" Cameron tweeted Monday night. ""Until then, I'm delighted he'll remain my de facto political deputy, play a key campaigning role and be Leader of the House of Commons."" Cameron confirmed Tuesday that Philip Hammond would step into Hague's shoes at the Foreign Office. Hammond, who has been serving as UK defense secretary, is seen as a critic of the European Union. Cameron has promised a referendum on UK membership of the EU by the end of 2017 if he is still Prime Minister after the 2015 election. His Conservative Party currently governs in coalition with the Liberal Democrats. Cameron has called for EU reform but was recently thwarted in his efforts to block the appointment of Jean-Claude Juncker as the next president of the European Commission, taking office later this year. That appointment is expected to be confirmed in a European Parliament vote later Tuesday. Another casualty of the Cabinet reshuffle was veteran MP and former chancellor of the exchequer Ken Clarke, who is a strong pro-European voice. ""Ken Clarke has been a political Titan for more than a generation. His wise and trenchant views will be missed around the Cabinet table,"" Cameron said via Twitter. While foreign secretary, Hague took a prominent stand on the issue of ending sexual violence in conflict, teaming up with Hollywood star and U.N. special envoy Angelina Jolie to call for global action. The pair co-chaired a summit in London last month which brought together representatives from nearly 130 countries. Hague said on Twitter that he would continue to lead the UK campaign to end sexual violence in conflict as Cameron's special representative. He added, ""I'm proud we now have a restored @foreignoffice, revived alliances, a new course in Europe, and stronger UK leadership on #humanrights."" Hague has previously published two books on British political history. CNN's Steve Almasy contributed to this report.","NEW: Hague's successor will be Philip Hammond, until now the UK defense secretary .

"London, England (CNN) -- As she took to the stage, both judges and spectators alike were unsure what the young Egyptian woman would do. Standing before the mic, dressed head to toe in a soft pink ensemble complete with a matching veil, Mayam Mahmoud was about to perform in front of an audience for the first time. Then, a hard-hitting beat began to blare out of the speakers and the 18-year-old started to rap. Since her captivating appearance on popular TV talent show ""Arabs Got Talent"" last October, the young veiled hip-hop artist has amassed a huge following for challenging how women in Egypt are meant to behave. Her lyrics highlight the importance of girls' education and denounce sexual harassment of women on the streets of Egypt. ""It was never about going on stage in a scarf,"" says Mahmoud. ""It was about going on stage and sharing a message,"" she adds. ""Egyptian women undergo harassment and bullying on a daily basis."" Award-winning . Last week Mahmoud's inspiring work for women's rights was recognized at the prestigious Index Freedom of Expression awards. The young singer, who won this year's Arts category, sat down with CNN before the ceremony to explain how she is tackling Egypt's sexual harassment of women head on. ""These are matters that are very present in Egypt but no one is talking about them -- they are a big problem in Egyptian society,"" she explains. ""It's about going out there and explaining your experience and sharing that with others so we know these problems exist and that is the way of changing views. ""Hip-hop as a genre of music is where people have an avenue to express what they feel, the problems they go through ... There is less of an emphasis on the performance itself but rather on what is actually being said."" Having grown up in a traditionally conservative, patriarchal society, Mahmoud's feminist rhymes resonate with many of her fans who encourage her to continue combating gender discrimination through her music. She raps in one of songs: ""Who said that femininity is about dresses? Femininity is about intelligence and intellect."" 'I defy that' Women in Egypt routinely face instances of sexual harassment -- according to a 2008 survey of 1,010 women conducted by the Egyptian Center for Women's rights, 83% of Egyptian women and 98% of foreign women have been sexually harassed. Mahmoud describes how women can feel self conscious simply for walking to school or work. ""She'll get looks and it can degenerate into touching. Another thing that commonly happens is that a woman can be walking in the street and she could be followed by a car. It could also degenerate to people hitting her from within the car or getting out of the car while saying all sorts of things to her. ""[These incidents] do not encourage her to leave her house anymore. It supports that idea that a woman should stay at home and not go out and I'm completely against that. I defy that."" Carnival of Freedom . The rapper, who is also an undergraduate studying politics and social science, also spends much of her time speaking to women who share their stories of daily discrimination with her. With their permission, Mahmoud then incorporates those experiences into her music. ""There is a lot of recent interest in women's rights in Egypt. People are more responsive at the moment and are becoming more interested in what I have to say. Because of this I set up a Facebook event called ""Carnival of Freedom"" and the whole point is to show or post day-to-day activities that are otherwise considered taboo in Egyptian culture. ""So for example, [it could be] women playing football or going to a cafe, playing pool or eating in the street. Essentially this is to keep encouraging men and women to be part of this natural need to enjoy one's self and express one's self with freedom."" For the time being, Mahmoud will continue to split her days between university and her passion for rapping. She acknowledges that she's young and is still trying to work out exactly what path to take. But she hopes her raps will continue to inspire others to change the way they think and treat others in Egyptian society. ""One of the strongest messages I'd like to send is, 'Freedom is an obligation on others before it becomes my right.'"" READ THIS: Capturing the new Rwanda .

"Havana, Cuba (CNN) -- Cuban authorities said Tuesday the infectious and sometimes deadly disease cholera had struck in Havana, after declaring in August that an earlier cholera outbreak had been wiped out. A statement from the Cuban Health Ministry said so far there were 51 confirmed cases in the new outbreak. The statement did not say if anyone had died from the disease, a bacterial infection of the small intestine, which causes severe diarrhea and vomiting in infected people. The Health Ministry statement Tuesday said the latest outbreak appeared to be caused by a food vendor who had not followed proper sanitary procedures. Residents in some of the neighborhoods where the outbreak occurred told CNN that food stands had been closed down and stations set up at the entrances to buildings for people to disinfect their shoes. The statement said that health workers were in the ""extermination phase"" of fighting the disease in the Cuban capital, which has a population of 2 million people. Cholera, according to the World Health Organization, still infects between 3 million and 5 million people each year, killing between 100,000 and 120,000. But until 2012, Cuba had not seen a cholera outbreak for more than 100 years. It is still not clear how the disease was reintroduced to the country.

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Buddy Holly finally got his star on Hollywood's Walk of Fame on Wednesday, which would have been the singer-songwriter's 75th birthday. ""It's never too late when you get a fantastic thing to happen,"" his widow, Maria Elena Holly, told CNN after unveiling the star on the sidewalk along Vine Street at the entrance to the historic Capitol Records building. Holly was just 22 when he was killed in a plane crash, along with musicians Ritchie Valens and J.P. ""The Big Bopper"" Richardson. ""I'm saying now, my dear Buddy, you loved to go to the movies. You told me that one of your dreams was to write scores for movies and make your mark in Hollywood,"" his widow said during the ceremony. ""Well, my dear, half of your dream unfortunately did not come true, but the other half did come true with a beautiful star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame."" Actor Gary Busey, who channeled Holly's voice and character in the 1978 movie ""The Buddy Holly Story,"" attended the dedication. ""He's here right now,"" Busey said. ""I feel his spirit in the air.

"(CNN) -- Australia's Prime Minister said Saturday that Chinese officials appreciate his country's ""transparency and candor"" in the handling of the search for missing Malaysia Airlines Flight 370. ""I think it's to our country's credit that we've approached it that way,"" Tony Abbott told journalists in China. He reiterated the ""high degree of confidence"" he has expressed before that acoustic signals picked up by searchers in the Indian Ocean are from the plane's black box. But he warned that, that even if the plane is lying on the bottom of the sea underneath the search vessels that locating it underneath nearly three miles of water would be a ""massive, massive task."" ""It is likely to continue for a long time to come,"" he said. U.S. Navy commander 'optimistic' The U.S. Navy commander leading the American effort to find Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 said he's ""optimistic"" about how the search is proceeding. ""We are detecting very continuous pings coming through in a manner consistent with exactly what you'd expect from a black box,"" Cmdr. William Marks told CNN's Erin Burnett on Friday. ""We've ruled out that it was anything natural, or anything from commercial shipping, or anything like that."" Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott said earlier Friday that search efforts are heading in the right direction. Marks said, ""I agree with the prime minister. We're optimistic."" Up to nine military aircraft, one civil aircraft and 14 ships will assist in Saturday's search for the airliner, Australia's Joint Agency Coordination Centre said in a press release. The center of the 41,393-square-kilometer (16,000 square-mile) search area lies about 2,331 kilometers (1,448 miles) northwest of Perth. Abbott's confidence . Abbott has expressed such confidence about detected acoustic signals coming from the plane's black box before. Over the past week, four such pings have been detected by a ping locator towed by the Australian vessel Ocean Shield. ""We are confident that we know the position of the black box flight recorder to within some kilometers, but confidence in the approximate position of the black box is not the same as recovering wreckage from almost 4Â½ kilometers beneath the sea or finally determining all that happened on that flight,"" he said. A fifth ping, detected Thursday by a sonobuoy dropped by an airplane, is ""unlikely to be related to the aircraft black boxes,"" Australian chief search coordinator Angus Houston said Friday. ""On the information I have available to me, there has been no major breakthrough in the search for MH370,"" Houston said in a statement Friday. ""Further analysis continues to be undertaken by Australian Joint Acoustic Analysis Centre."" Friday was Day 35 in the search, and the batteries powering the flight data recorders' locator beacons are certified to emit signals for only 30 days after they get wet. That has injected the search effort with a heightened sense of urgency. The signal is ""starting to fade, and we are hoping to get as much information as we can before the signal finally expires,"" Abbott said. Families skeptical . Families of the 239 people who were aboard when the plane disappeared from radar screens early March 8 met Friday with Malaysia Airlines and government officials. They came away unpersuaded that progress was being made. ""Today, all they said was that they were confident,"" family representative Steve Wang said. ""But that really doesn't mean that they have confirmed it. They didn't use the word 'confirm.' So it could be that it's a real lead, but it could also not be. I think that, at the moment, everyone needs to wait for final, confirmed information."" That view was echoed by Sarah Bajc, whose partner, Philip Wood, was among the passengers. ""Every time some official gives one of those absolute statements of 'We're sure it's the pings from the black boxes' or 'We're sure it's in the ocean,' we all crash,"" she told CNN's ""New Day."" ""Our feet get knocked out from underneath us. But then it always ends up reversing itself, and they step back from it."" She expressed skepticism about the way the investigation has been handled. ""The fox is very much in charge of the henhouse here,"" she told ""New Day."" ""We've got a country leading the investigation who also has the primary liability in the case, and it makes us question every step that's taken."" New flight details revealed . Malaysian sources told CNN that Flight 370's pilot, Capt. Zaharie Ahmad Shah, was the last person on the jet to speak to air traffic controllers, telling them ""Good night, Malaysian three-seven-zero."" The sources said there was nothing unusual about his voice, which conveyed no indication that he was under stress. One of the sources, an official involved in the investigation, told CNN that police played the recording to five other Malaysia Airlines pilots who knew the pilot and co-pilot. ""There were no third-party voices,"" the source said. Imagining the search underwater . Search area shrinks . Up to 12 military aircraft, three civil aircraft and 13 ships were assigned to assist in Friday's search for the Boeing 777-200ER, which was carrying 239 people when it vanished on March 8 on a fight from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, to Beijing. There were no sightings reported by search aircraft or objects recovered by ships Thursday, the Joint Agency Coordination Centre said. Friday's search area was about 18,000 square miles (46,600 square kilometers), centered 1,436 miles (2,311 kilometers) northwest of Perth. That's far smaller than the search area's size a few weeks ago. ""It's pretty incredible if you look at where we started, which was virtually the entire Indian Ocean. Now getting it down to what's essentially a couple hundred square miles (where the pings have been detected) is pretty miraculous,"" Marks said. The Ocean Shield first picked up two sets of underwater pulses April 5 that were of a frequency close to that used by the locator beacons. It heard nothing more until Tuesday, when it reacquired the signals twice. The four signals were within 17 miles of one another. As the search continues, a U.S. Navy ship will help provide supplies and fuel to the ships that are looking for the missing plane. The USNS Cesar Chavez will help supply Australian naval ships involved in the search ""in the coming days,"" the Navy said in a statement. That's probably a sign that search teams are preparing for a lengthy hunt, analysts said. Tracking pings is only one early step in the hunt to find the plane's data records, wreckage and the people aboard. ""I think they're getting ready for the long haul,"" said Goelz, the aviation analyst. ""Even if they do get four or five more pings, once they drop the side-scanning sonar device down, that is going to be painstaking and long. So I think they are settling in for the long search.""

"(CNN) -- As rescuers take on the daunting task of finding survivors, family members of the missing passengers are pinning slim hopes on floundering air pockets in the capsized South Korean ferry. They know the odds aren't in their favor, particularly after the entire ferry went underwater Friday. But they point to one especially miraculous tale of survival for their reason for not giving up. In May 2013, a tug boat carrying a 12-person crew capsized off the coast of Nigeria. Two divers sent to recover the bodies assumed everyone aboard had died. After all, the boat was about 100 feet down under the Atlantic Ocean. Three days had passed. And when a diver reached for a hand he thought belonged to a corpse, he discovered it was Harrison Okene, the boat's cook. Okene had survived 60 hours in a 4-foot space -- a tiny air bubble -- where he'd taken shelter. ""The rest of my life is not enough to thank God for this wonder, it is incredible,"" he told a local newspaper at the time. Some have also pointed to the Italian cruise ship Costa Concordia, which ran aground and capsized in January 2012, killing dozens. Some survivors were pulled out after being trapped inside the ship for more than 30 hours. Anguish over sinking amplified by misinformation . Comparing the incidents . Do those parallels apply to South Korean ferry, Sewol? In the case of the Costa Concordia, the cruise ship was not fully submerged. Sewol is. As for air pockets, also known as ""voids,"" they could provide those on board with a chance of survival, said maritime expert Kim Petersen said. ""It's difficult to say since we don't know the cause of the vessel sinking,"" he said. ""If it had been because of a problem with one of the vehicle doors, of course that could cause massive flooding very quickly and reduce the likelihood of voids. ""But the fact is that this is a vessel that is almost 500 feet in length and it's sitting in waters that we believe to be between 70 and 110 feet deep, so there is the strong possibility that there are voids and the possibility of survivors."" Potential air pockets offer hope . Many caveats . Trapped passengers, if there are any, also have to think ahead. ""When they're in a small compartment ... with an air bubble, they really have to stay calm and breathe shallow and conserve the oxygen in that space,"" former Navy diver Bobbie Scholley told CNN. However, Petersen warned that the effort to reach those trapped in potential voids will not be easy. ""The problem now is getting divers down into those areas and bringing those people to the surface,"" he said. Divers must contend with fierce winds and rough waters. ""There are heavy currents in the area. So the vessel itself is not stable in the water. So you are, by default, putting divers at risk,"" U.S. Navy Capt. Heidi Agle told CNN's Wolf Blitzer. The U.S. Navy is assisting with the South Korean search. The frigid waters . Then, there's the temperature. The water is a frigid 50 F (10 C). At that temperature, exhaustion sets in within one to two hours. And the expected survival time is no more than six hours, CNN meteorologist Samantha Mohr said. Still, rescue teams continued to pump air into the hull of the submerged ship Friday. Like the family members, they aren't ready to give up yet. CNN's Euan McKirdy contributed to this report.","Passengers who get to an air pocket may still have a shot .

""Bringing a world-class race to the world's largest media market is a huge undertaking that has required balancing construction of our road course, without tapping any public money, with the Sport's own timing demands."" The race is set to run on a 5.15 kilometer temporary street circuit along the Hudson River, with the New York City skyline as the backdrop. It is an event which F1 supremo Bernie Ecclestone is keen to witness. ""There is great demand for a race in New Jersey and I have no doubt we'll be racing at Port Imperial in 2015,"" he said in a statement Wednesday. ""New races can take many years to get started, but there is significant momentum and we are close to realizing a New York City F1 race."" The Autodromo Hermanos Rodriguez in Mexico City requires refurbishing before it is ready to host a race in 2015.

"(CNN) --   The Cleveland Clinic will announce Wednesday the successful completion of a near-total face transplant surgery, a clinic spokeswoman told CNN on Tuesday. Isabelle Dinoire underwent the first partial face transplant; shortly after her surgery (left) and 10 months later (right). In the surgery -- which was conducted two weeks ago by a team of eight surgeons at the Cleveland, Ohio, hospital -- 80 percent of the trauma patient's face was transplanted, the spokeswoman said. The forehead and chin were left intact. The surgery was the first such operation done in the United States. In 2005, French doctors performed the world's first partial face transplant on a 38-year-old woman who was disfigured when she was attacked by a dog. ""I hope the successful operation will help other people like me to live again,"" said Isabelle Dinoire, the French woman who received a nose, lips and chin.","Cleveland Clinic to announce surgeons there performed the first U.S. face transplant .

"Havana, Cuba (CNN) -- Cuba's government declared Tuesday that health workers had eradicated a cholera outbreak that infected 417 people and killed three, according to a statement from the country's Health Ministry. In early July, Cuba said the sometimes fatal water-borne illness had returned to the eastern part of the island. It was the first outbreak of the disease in Cuba in more than a century. Cuban doctors battle to control cholera outbreak . Doctors were not certain how cholera was reintroduced to the island, but said that heavy rains that caused outhouses to flood into drinking wells were to blame for the disease's rapid rate of transmission. Cholera, a bacterial infection of the small intestine, causes severe diarrhea and vomiting in infected people. During a visit by CNN in July to hospitals at the epicenter of the outbreak, doctors said they initially struggled with the surge of people sickened by the disease. ""They started coming in a few at a time,"" said Julio Cesar Fonseca Rivero, director of the Celia Sanchez Manduley Hospital, the largest in Granma Province. That province was the hardest hit by the outbreak. ""The first day five came, and then eight. The most critical days were when there were 30 to 32 patients who arrived in a single day."" The disease, according to the World Health Organization, still infects between 3 million and 5 million people each year, killing between 100,000 and 120,000. Cuban health officials said they responded to the outbreak by bringing in clean drinking water, closing down food stands in affected areas and setting up checkpoints on roads to keep people ill with the disease from traveling. Cuban leader Raul Castro mentioned the outbreak in a speech to the nation in late July, saying it had been brought under control. According to the Health Ministry statement released Tuesday, 10 days have passed since the last reported case of cholera.","The cholera outbreak hit Granma Province the hardest .

"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- People walked by 12-year-old Yance Phillips as he danced on Hollywood Boulevard on Sunday. YaYa, 2, stands near framed coverage of Michael Jackson's death on the Walk of Fame on Sunday. He swayed and bounced to the beat of a boom box, drawing only a glance from people making their way down the Hollywood Walk of Fame. Then he moonwalked, and suddenly, Phillips had the crowd's attention. ""I watched Michael Jackson, and I just tried to do it like he does,"" Yance said. ""I like the moves that he does."" As thousands gathered in Los Angeles to say goodbye to a star who had been entertaining since he was a little boy, it was hard not to notice the children in the crowd. Toddlers in the arms of their parents who were fans, and kids wearing T-shirts emblazoned with Jackson's face gathered at the Staples Center and beyond as the city geared up for the pop icon's memorial service. A group of tweens even pooled their money to trek from the Valley to Hollywood -- sans adults and sharing a digital camera -- to take pictures of Jackson's star on the Walk of Fame for a video they wanted to create.  See what fans had to say at the Walk of Fame » . They were too young to know about the singer's legal troubles or to remember a time when Jackson's appearance was quite different from what it was in his final years. To them, he was just a star who could sing and dance across a floor like magic. ""I like all of his music and how he dresses,"" said 8-year-old Sarah McClure as she glanced down at her own Michael Jackson T-shirt. ""My favorite is 'Thriller.' "" McClure traveled more than 90 miles with her little sister, Emily, 5, and her mother, Geri McClure, to visit the Staples Center, where the memorial to Jackson will be held Tuesday. As they waited in line to sign a wall of remembrance to the singer, Geri McClure said she wanted her daughters ""to be a part of history."" ""Plus, they love his music,"" she added. ""He was an entertainer for the different generations."" Barbara Alvarez and her husband, David, endured the heat as well as they waited with their children Isaac, 8, William, 4, and 1-year-old Ava. ""Watching and listening to Michael Jackson was one of the happiest memories of my childhood,"" Alvarez said. ""I grew up on his music."" She wanted to impart that to her kids. Isaac smiled shyly as his mother revealed that he became a fan years ago after she showed him the ""Thriller"" video. ""My daughter even dances to his music,"" said Alvarez, as Ava rested in the shade of her stroller. Yance Phillips said he was doing his moonwalk on Hollywood Boulevard to raise money to help bury a relative. Donations poured into the jar at his feet. His grandmother, Regina Stevenson, said Jackson's appeal was-wide ranging and touched fans of all ages and nationalities. ""He showed children of all races that they could be successful,"" Stevenson said. Maria Pace, who is almost 20 years old, said she can remember how Jackson helped ease the path of her younger years. She was a shy girl from Spain, unsure of how to make friends in her new homeland of Bakersfield, California, when a fellow classmate  played some Michael Jackson music and the pair bonded. ""She liked Michael Jackson music, and I liked Michael Jackson music, and we started dancing to it,"" Pace recalled. ""It was me, her and another girl, and we became known as the Jackson girls."" Pace said she doesn't believe there will ever be another entertainer like Jackson, but she hopes younger generations continue to be inspired by him -- especially a trio of children who know firsthand of his talent. ""Maybe one day,"" Pace said, ""one of his children will become a performer.""","Children among thousands in Los Angeles saying goodbye to pop star .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Nine technicians responsible for monitoring operations at a Louisiana nuclear power plant spent on-duty time surfing the Internet -- visiting websites that included news, sports, fishing and retirement information -- jeopardizing the safety of the plant, federal regulators say. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission disclosed the web-surfing activities Monday in a letter that proposes a $140,000 fine against the River Bend nuclear power station, 24 miles northwest of Baton Rouge. No pornography sites were accessed, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission said. And importantly, the NRC said, the computer use did not present an avenue for hackers to gain access to reactor control systems, a modern-day fear at industrial plants. But the NRC said the web-surfing control room operators were directly responsible for monitoring the reactor and other plant systems, and that their actions violated plant procedures requiring operators to remain attentive and focused on their work. According to an NRC investigation, nine operators ""deliberately violated"" the safety procedures by surfing the web between January and April of 2010. Three of the nine did so with such frequency and duration that they are being issued ""severity level three enforcement violations."" (Severity level one represents the greatest significant violation and severity level four is the lowest.) The remaining six operators will receive severity level four violations. The operators were not named by the NRC. An NRC spokesman said the proposed fine for web surfing is the only such action for web surfing in memory, and may be the only such action in the history of the agency. In a notice to Entergy Operations Inc., operators of the River Bend Station, the NRC said that it appears that operators ""remained attentive to reactor operations, indications, and alarms"" while surfing the Internet. ""However, because most of the operators involved knew and understood"" the prohibitions on Internet access, they exhibited ""deliberate misconduct"" and engaged in ""hundreds of instances"" of accessing the Internet from the ""at-the-controls"" area of the control room. ""This violation is a serious concern to the NRC not only because accessing the Internet ... has the potential to distract the licensed operator,"" the NRC said, but also because of the ""large number of licensed reactor operators"" who deliberately chose to ignore the ban. The NRC chastised the plant, saying that while River Bend Station ""had strong evidence that a safety culture problem existed,"" comprehensive actions were not taken for ""at least a year."" NRC regional administrator Elmo Collins said in the letter that River Bend's ""particularly poor performance"" in responding to the problem merited doubling the base fine of $70,000 to $140,000. If Entergy Operations disagrees with the enforcement action and proposed fine, the company can request a neutral mediator to explore a resolution, according to the NRC. Entergy Operations Inc. did not immediately respond to a call. CNN's Dave Alsup contributed to this report.","NRC wants to fine operators of Louisiana nuclear plant $140,000 .

"New York (CNN) -- By all accounts, the collision of a pair of double-decker tour buses in Manhattan's bustling Time Square could have been worse. At least 13 people were injured Tuesday, one seriously, after two of the buses which traverse city neighborhoods collided about 4 p.m. The crash occurred near a normally packed sidewalk next to the TKTS booth at 47th Street and Seventh Avenue, police and fire officials said. Earthcam video from the scene showed pedestrians running from the crash site moments before a towering pole crashed to the sidewalk, appearing to strike a man in the leg and narrowly missing his head. A fire official at the scene said the number of injuries was surprisingly low given the size of the pole. ""I thought people were going to die,"" said Ida Bailey, an employee of one of the bus lines involved in the accident. ""I started praying."" Bailey said a GrayLine bus -- with a driver and tour guide -- apparently was unable to stop and struck a light pole or traffic light before hitting a CitySights tour bus packed with passengers. ""The driver told me the brakes weren't working and he couldn't stop,"" she said. Investigators have clear video showing a bus closest to the sidewalk speeding through the intersection and striking an SUV and another bus that just passed the intersection, according to a law enforcement official who saw the video. The driver of that bus claimed he was having brake issues, the law enforcement official said. The driver was being questioned by the NYPD, which is investigating the accident, the law enforcement official said. Bailey said most of the injuries appeared to take place on the crowded sidewalk. A fire official confirmed that many of the wounded were on the sidewalk -- some struck by flying debris. None of the injuries are considered life threatening, police and fire officials said. Times Square is a popular launching spot for the ubiquitous double-decker buses which take tourists around Manhattan. After the accident, dozens of tourists stood at what is sometimes called the ""Crossroads of the World,"" taking pictures and video of the crash scene. Crime and Justice Producer Shimon Prokupecz contributed to this report.","At least 13 people were injured when two tour buses collided in New York's Times Square .

"United Nations (CNN) -- South Korea has formally asked the U.N. Security Council for action over what it says was North Korea's sinking of one of its warships in March, the Mexico U.N. mission said. A letter from South Korea arrived in the offices of Mexico, which holds the current council presidency. Ambassador Claude Heller, Security Council president from Mexico, said Korea delivered a letter requesting the body take action. He said the letter will be circulated to council members and the council will respond appropriately after consulting with other members. South Korea investigated the incident and says a North Korean mini-sub fired torpedoes at the Cheonan naval ship and killed 46 people. North Korea denies it attacked the vessel and called the probe a farce. South Korea President Lee Myung-bak, who announced the move in Singapore at a security conference, said North Korea ""must admit its wrongdoing. It must pledge to never again engage in such reprehensible action."" ""If we think that after a while North Korea's action will be condoned and that stability on the Korean Peninsula will somehow be maintained then we would be foolling ourselves because North Korea would once again resort back to attacking others.""","South Korea formally asks the U.N.

"(CNN) -- The Texas Board of Education this week will vote on science standards that critics say seek to cast doubt on the theory of evolution. A woman stands in front of a mural depicting the development from ape to computer user. The board -- considering amendments passed in January -- will hear from the public on Wednesday. It will then take votes -- an initial one Thursday and the final vote Friday. ""This specific attack on well-established science ignores mountains of evidence and years of research done by experts in a variety of fields,"" said Steven Newton, project director at the Oakland California-based National Center for Science Education, a proponent of evolution. One amendment, critics say, undermines the idea that life on Earth derives from a common ancestry, a major principle in the theory of evolution. It calls for the analysis and evaluation of ""the sufficiency or insufficiency"" of the common ancestry idea to explain the fossil record. Newton said the board is considering other amendments casting doubt on well-established ideas in the earth and space sciences -- plate tectonics, radioactive decay and how the solar system developed. School board chairman Don McLeroy has wanted to tackle questions that highlight supposed weaknesses in the theory. For example, skeptics of evolution point to what they contend are fossil record gaps casting doubt on the scientific evidence of common ancestry. ""I'm a skeptic. I'm an evolution skeptic. I don't think it's true,"" he said. ""You need to present other ideas to the kids."" The issue reflects the strong feelings among representatives on the 15-member board, some of whom accept evolutionary theory and some of whom don't. The size of the textbook market in Texas gives it influence nationwide, as publishers adapt their material to its standards. The board in January voted to remove language that called on science teachers to focus on the ""strengths and weaknesses"" in all scientific theories. It was replaced by language urging students to use ""empirical evidence, logical reasoning, and experimental and observational testing"" to ""analyze and evaluate scientific explanations."" More amendments are expected to be brought up in the three-day hearing. Charles Darwin's theory of evolution proposes that humans evolved over millions of years from animal species -- including, most famously, early primates that also are the ancestors of modern-day apes. Such thinking, which challenged religious accounts of a deity creating humans, was considered radical, even blasphemous, when Darwin published it in 1859. Central to Darwin's thesis was his scientific explanation of life's diversity: that natural selection is enough to explain the evolution of all species. The scientific community has overwhelmingly scorned creationism and its latest incarnation, intelligent design, as a pretext for biblical explanations of how the world came to be, and asserts that there is no weakness or doubt in the scientific community about evolution. Last year, the National Academy of Sciences called for the public to be better informed about the importance of understanding and teaching evolution. The academy released a booklet titled ""Science, Evolution, and Creationism"" -- the third explanation of evolution put out since 1984 by one of the nation's leading scientific organizations. However, those who take issue with evolution believe it should be treated with healthy skepticism. The San Antonio Express-news quotes Casey Luskin, a policy analyst with the Discovery Institute, a group that questions the theory of evolution: . ""This debate will impact whether students are taught to think critically and scientifically when you learn about evolution. It's important for students to learn how to think like scientists and not be forced to treat these controversial topics like a dogma,"" he is quoted as saying. Proponents of evolution say the dogma is on the other side, with the Discovery Institute and others purposely distorting and ignoring scientific evidence to reach their desired conclusion. For decades, the teaching of evolution in public schools has been flashpoint in some states, with proponents of ideas such as creationism and intelligent design trying to gain a place in science classes. The issue has been before school officials, legislators and courts in Alabama, Kansas, Kentucky, Ohio, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, and Virginia. The controversy over the teaching of intelligent design came to a head in Pennsylvania, where the Dover School Board voted that ninth-grade students must be read a statement encouraging them to read about intelligent design. A federal judge said the board violated the Constitution in doing so because intelligent design is religious creationism in disguise and injecting it into the curriculum violates the constitutional separation of church and state. ""Academic freedom"" bills have emerged but failed in various state legislatures, the National Center for Science Education said. An ""academic freedom"" act has been adopted as law in Louisiana, and there is legislation in Florida calling for an ""academic freedom"" bill that would mandate a ""thorough presentation and critical analysis of the scientific theory of evolution."" The center says such bills are strategies by creationists to appeal to the American sense of balance, and give the false sense that there are different sides to scientific issues such as evolution. ""Two plus 2 is not 5,"" said the group's spokesman, Robert Luhn.","Texas Board of Education will vote this week on the curriculum amendments .

Critics say the proposed curriculum questions ideas in the earth and space sciences .

"(CNN) -- The taxi rocked to the pounding sounds of French rap music. My wife turned to our hostess. ""Can you ask him to turn it down?"" The hostess waved her hands nervously. ""No, it will only offend him."" She explained: The massive Paris taxi shortage had transformed the city's cab drivers into so many motorized Soup Nazis: ""My cab, my music; if you don't like it -- walk."" Back in 1937, Paris capped the number of taxi permits at 14,000. Now, 75 years later, a bigger and vastly richer Paris receives some 27 million tourist visits per year -- and the number of cabs has edged up less than 14%, to 15,900. Result: In wind and rain and baking sun, Parisians must stand in long lines at taxi stands for cabs that never come. In 2007, the new government of Nicolas Sarkozy proposed to supplement the existing fleet. It would license 6,500 new cars in Paris, 23,500 in the rest of France. The proposal triggered a strike that shut down the city for a day -- and frightened Sarkozy into surrender. Five years later, it's as difficult to find a cab in Paris as ever. (Paris has about 2,000 more cab licenses than New York, which has a much bigger population, but New York has a vast fleet of cars for hire to supplement medallion cabs -- and except for the luxury market, car services are illegal in Paris.) On the list of world problems, the difficulties of Paris taxi riders may seem to rank low. Think again. Almost 3 million French people are now out of work, the severest unemployment in 12 years. Millions more have quit the workforce altogether, subsisting on disability pensions or other social benefits. Prolonged mass unemployment in Europe has triggered a global debate about the euro currency, and rightly so. Yet it's also true that every day, people in Europe are denied work by dumb laws that prevent willing customers from hiring them. Adding 30,000 new taxi licenses in France would mean more than 90,000 daily taxi shifts: In other words, upwards of 90,000 new jobs. And it's not just taxis. France's Raffarin law strictly regulates the creation of new retail premises. Anyone who wishes to create a new store in France of more than 300 square meters must first gain permission from a government commission that includes -- wait for it! -- other existing retailers. In Germany likewise, the federal government until recently forbade stores to stay open past 10 p.m. (In 2011, the federal government transferred authority over hours to the states, some of which have chosen to allow longer openings.) In almost every European country, restrictions on firing workers have made employers very reluctant about hiring in the first place. That hesitation -- plus heavy payroll taxes that raise hiring costs -- explain why so many European restaurants, cafes, and shops seem so lightly staffed compared to their American counterparts. These are not macroeconomic issues. They don't involve central banks or currency policy. These are anti-competitive rules that prevent hiring that employers would want to do even in bad economic times. Fixing these rules requires some political courage, which is never in super-abundant supply. But courage is not the only thing needed. Imagination and ingenuity are even more important. Go back to our Parisian taxi drivers. Why are they so opposed to adding to the taxi fleet? Interestingly, they're not concerned about competition for fares: They know as well as anybody that the cab shortage is leaving money quite literally standing on the sidewalk. What concerns them, rather, is the value of their licenses. Paris drivers have paid nearly 200,000 euros for their licenses -- money they have usually borrowed and must work frantically to repay. Drivers regard their licenses as precious capital assets, which they hope to resell in turn. If the fleet increases, the value of those licenses would presumably drop. Sarkozy's 2007 reform proposals called for giving away the 30,000 additional licenses for free. It said nothing about compensating the existing licensees. If drivers had been reassured on that point, they might have been mollified -- and if they still protested, overriding such protests would have been easier. France's new president, Francois Hollande, has yet to take a stance on this. It's not enough for Europe's would-be reformers to summon their courage. They must also be shrewd -- and that's no easy task in a crisis terrifying enough to cause almost anyone to lose his or her head. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of David Frum.","Paris is suffering from a world-famous taxi shortage, says David Frum .
Despite attempts at reform, the number of taxis has increased only 14% since 1937, he says .
Europe's economic crisis is embodied in France's failure to fix this problem, Frum says .

"(CNN) -- Six months after a devastating earthquake struck Haiti, most governments that promised money to help rebuild the country have not delivered any funds at all, a CNN investigation has found. Donors promised $5.3 billion at an aid conference in March, about two months after the earthquake -- but less than 2 percent of that money has been handed over so far to the United Nations-backed body set up to handle it. Only four countries have paid anything at all: Brazil, Norway, Estonia and Australia. The United States pledged $1.15 billion. It has paid nothing, with the money tied up in the congressional appropriations process. Venezuela promised even more -- $1.32 billion. It has also paid nothing, although it has written off some of Haiti's debt. Former President Bill Clinton, a U.N. special envoy for Haiti, said he plans to put pressure on governments that have been slow to deliver on their promises. ""I'm going to call all those governments and say, the ones who said they'll give money to support the Haitian government, I want to try to get them to give the money, and I'm trying to get the others to give me a schedule for when they'll release it,"" Clinton told CNN's Anderson Cooper earlier this week. He said the worldwide economic crisis was at least partly to blame. ""I think that they're all having economic trouble, and they want to hold their money as long as possible,"" Clinton said. Altogether, about $506 million has been disbursed to Haiti since the donors' conference in March, said Jehane Sedky of the U.N. Development Program. That's about 9 percent of the money that was pledged. But about $200 million was money that had been in the pipeline for aid work before the earthquake, and about another $200 million went directly to the government of Haiti to help it get back on its feet, Sedky explained. That has left the commission with about $90 million in donations since the conference, Sedky said. There is some dispute about the World Bank's contribution . The bank says it has made available $479 million dollars, and of that $56.6 million has ""already been used"" for different government-led projects. The World Bank says that this money was provided directly to the Haitian government and did not go into the Interim Haiti Recovery Commission. CNN compiled the information for this report by reviewing commission figures and surveying the donors that had made pledges to determine the disposition of those pledges. Spain, France and Canada are also among the countries that have not yet followed through on their pledges, CNN found. No countries told CNN they do not plan to deliver the money eventually. The pledges are for fiscal year 2010-2011, so the donors have until the middle of next year to get the funds to the Haiti recovery commission, Sedky said. U.N. spokesman Farhan Haq said Wednesday that aid delivery to Haiti is going relatively well compared to other disaster relief efforts the world body has been involved in. ""Compared with other disasters, coordination systems in Haiti have actually functioned reasonably well,"" he said, adding that there was no requirement for aid efforts to work within systems. ""But within that constraint, what we've been trying to do is coordinate the aid responses as best as we can, and we are trying to provide food as quickly as possible,"" he said. Some charities, meanwhile, are spending money as fast as they get it, while others are planning long-term projects. Doctors Without Borders -- primarily a disaster-relief organization -- has received $112 million and spent $65 million, it says. The group plans to spend more than $109 million by the end of the year, spokesman Michael Goldfarb told CNN. The Red Cross has spent $148 million of the $468 million it has taken in, and is holding some money in reserve for more permanent projects such as shelter and water. Private money has also come in from the Clinton Foundation, from Mexican telecommunications billionaire Carlos Slim Helu and Canadian mining investor Frank Giustra, but that's not part of the $5.3 billion pledged by countries at the conference in March. The January 12 quake left more than 220,000 dead, 300,000-plus injured and more than 1 million homeless. According to recent U.N. reports, the quake destroyed 60 percent of government infrastructure and left more than 180,000 homes uninhabitable. Six months later, more than 1.5 million remain in overcrowded displacement camps. According to the United Nations, 1,300 camping sites and 11,000 latrines have been built, and thousands of kilos of food and humanitarian resources have been delivered to those in need. CNN'S Richard Roth at the United Nations contributed to this report.","International donors promised $5.3 billion to Haiti after the earthquake .

"(CNN) -- T-Mobile is making a bid to become the wireless world's ""un-carrier,"" rolling out a plan that will let users update their phones up to twice a year for a modest fee. That's a sharp departure from the traditional model for wireless companies, which usually requires customers to complete a two-year contract before they can get a new smartphone at the discounted rate that makes them affordable. ""At some point, big wireless companies made a decision for you that you should have to wait two years to get a new phone for a fair price. That's 730 days of waiting,"" said John Legere, president and CEO of T-Mobile US, in a written announcement. ""(That's) 730 days of watching new phones come out that you can't have. Or having to live with a cracked screen or an outdated camera,"" he added. ""We say two years is just too long to wait."" The company's new JUMP! plan will cost $10 a month per phone and includes insurance for phones that are damaged, lost or malfunctioning. Some wireless customers already pay for such protection. Customers can upgrade after being enrolled in the JUMP! program for six months. At a New York event, T-Mobile also announced an expansion of its 4G LTE network, which it says will reach 157 million people in 116 metro areas across the United States. The announcement is part of T-Mobile's newly aggressive approach as the carrier tries to move up from fourth place in market share in the United States. It trails first-place Verizon, then AT&T and Sprint. Research firm comScore says Verizon has about 31% of the market, followed by AT&T at 27%, Sprint at 16% and T-Mobile at about 13%. In March, T-Mobile took another big leap, announcing that it would offer wireless plans with no contract. It also began selling the iPhone 5 for $99 in April.","New T-Mobile plan lets customers upgrade to a new phone up to twice yearly .

"(CNN) -- The underwater drone scanning the ocean for Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 ended its eighth mission Monday, having covered about two thirds of its intended territory without finding any sign of the missing plane. This has been the case for 45 days now, which seems like an eternity for the relatives of the 239 passengers and crew on board, still hoping for a miracle or, at least, closure. ""Emotionally, it's up and down. You know? Sometimes, I'm OK. Sometimes, so-so. Sometimes -- always -- very sad,"" said Nur Laila Ngah, whose husband worked on the flight's cabin crew. The couple had been planning to celebrate their 13th anniversary this year. They have three children, ages 12, 10 and 8. Recalling a conversation she had with her husband before he left, Laila said: ""I was asking him, 'are we going to have the next 13 years together?' Of course."" About their children, she said: ""They have faith that their father will be coming back."" The Bluefin-21 began its eighth mission Sunday, surveying the bottom of the southern Indian Ocean for traces of the Boeing 777. It is expected to start its ninth mission later Monday. These efforts may be a main focus of the search, but they aren't the only part. Australia's Joint Agency Coordination Centre announced Monday morning that up to 10 military aircraft and 11 ships would participate in the day's search. Previously, acting Malaysian Transport minister Hishammuddin Hussein said that ""experts have narrowed down the search area."" But are they actually closer to finding anything? ""It's difficult to say,"" Hishammuddin conceded, adding the search ""is at a critical juncture."" ""I appeal to everybody around the world,"" he said, ""to pray and pray hard that we find something to work on over the next couple of days."" The failure to find clues to the plane's disappearance does not mean that the operation will stop, only that other approaches -- such as a wider scope or the use of other assets -- may be considered, Hishammuddin told reporters. ""The search will always continue."" Still, he said, ""With every passing day, the search has become more and more difficult."" Mother Nature isn't making this task much easier. Tropical Cyclone Jack is circulating northwest of the search area. And while it won't hit directly, this system should increase winds and rains. Malaysian authorities briefed families of people aboard Flight 370 behind closed doors Sunday afternoon in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. Selamat Bin Omar, whose 29-year-old son was a passenger, told CNN that officials dealt with practical matters, such as how the families could make bank transactions. Hamid Ramlan, whose daughter and son-in-law were on the plane, said he learned nothing new at the briefing. ""I believe that the government didn't try to hide something, or hide any information from us. They are telling the truth. But then, mostly the members of victims, the families, they do not want to believe,"" he said. His wife falls into that category. ""My wife cannot accept that. She still believes that the airplane was hijacked. She believes that my daughter is still alive."" Passengers' relatives list questions . It was early on March 8 when Flight 370 set off from the Malaysian capital of Kuala Lumpur, destined for Beijing. The plane never made it. What happened has been a confounding mystery, with the frustration of passengers' family members compounded by a scarcity of details from authorities. New bits of information that have come out six weeks later may help round out the picture but don't answer the main question: Why did the plane go off course, and where is it now? These recent developments include a senior Malaysian aviation source's assertion that the jetliner deviated from its flight path while inside Vietnamese airspace. It turned left, then climbed to 39,000 feet -- below its maximum safe limit of 43,100 feet -- and maintained that altitude for about 20 minutes over the Malay Peninsula before beginning to descend, the source said. Malaysia Airlines has declined to answer CNN's questions on various matters -- including the fact that, according to the source, the missing jet was equipped with four emergency locator transmitters. When triggered by a crash, ELTs are designed to transmit their location to a satellite. Relatives of people aboard the jetliner have drawn up 26 questions that they want addressed by Malaysian officials, who are to meet with them next week in Beijing. Most of the Flight 370 passengers were Chinese. Among them: What's in the flight's log book? Can they review the jet's maintenance records? Can they listen to recordings of the Boeing 777 pilot's conversations with air traffic controllers just before contact was lost? Hishammuddin has defended his government's handling of the operation and accused members of the media of focusing on the Chinese families. He said relatives of passengers and crew from other nations represented have not had problems. ""The most difficult part of any investigation of this nature is having to deal with the families,"" he said. CNN's Nic Robertson, Sumnima Udas, Aaron Cooper, Tom Watkins, Todd Borek, Pamela Boykoff, Mitra Mobasherat, Ivan Watson, Brian Todd, Elizabeth Joseph and Erin Burnett contributed to this report.","NEW: Underwater drone finishes 8th mission, still no trace of missing plane .

"(CNN) -- Endurance swimmer Diana Nyad struggled through ocean swells, shoulder pain and asthma Monday as she attempted to become the first person to swim between Cuba and Florida without a shark cage, according to her team and a CNN staffer on a chase boat. Both the swells and the 61-year-old swimmer's shoulder pain subsided somewhat and she was ""swimming strongly,"" her team said in a post to Facebook around noon ET. Follow Nyad on CNN's tracker . The shoulder pain was ""down to an 8"" following some ""therapeutic healing,"" the message said. The shoulder pain remained an issue around 2 p.m., about 18 hours into the swim, said CNN staffer Matt Sloane -- who is following Nyad on a chase boat -- in a tweet. She is also having ""a little touch of asthma,"" he said. But he added that Nyad is ""still going very strong."" Nyad in good spirits in 18th hour . The attempt to swim from Cuba to Florida is the second for the swimmer, who said at a news conference Sunday that she is fitter today than she was in 1978, when she first attempted the crossing but was unable to finish. ""When I walk up on those shores of Florida, I want to prove to the AARP crowd that it's not too late to go back and write that book or adopt that child,"" she said. She jumped into the water at 7:45 p.m. ET on Sunday and expects to swim for roughly 60 hours. She is stopping briefly each hour to eat. ""Nobody decides the swim is over except me,"" Nyad's team quoted her on Twitter as saying. Wind, water, one woman's drive . It took several months to gain permission for the swim from Cuban and U.S. authorities. Bureaucratic snags repeatedly threatened to call off the effort -- already called off in 2010 because of weather. Nyad has been training for the event for two years, swimming up to 12 hours a day. ""I'm almost 62 years old and I'm standing here at the prime of my life,"" she said Sunday as she prepared to dive into the water at Havana's Marina Hemingway. ""I think this is the prime. When one reaches this age, you still have a body that's strong but now you have a better mind."" A team of more than 30 people is supporting Nyad as she attempts the crossing. She has 10 handlers to advise her as she swims, ocean kayakers towing devices to repel most sharks and divers and safety officers trained to distract those that aren't turned away. A doctor is also on hand.","NEW: Nyad: ""Nobody decides the swim is over except me""

"(CNN) -- If any place on earth was likely to erect a statue to the critic, it may be Cannes. This year, cinema's most famous critic-turned-director, Jean-Luc Godard, competes for the Palme d'Or at the age of 83 with his first 3D-film ""Farewell to Language"" -- and the current crop of critics will deliver their verdicts in print, on radio, on television and online to audiences around the world. Loved and loathed in equal measure, these cinematic scribblers can influence film fans' decisions on whether or not to buy a ticket to the movie theater, so even in a world becoming increasingly dominated by amateur critics on social media there's still a degree of responsibility in delivering honest, considered opinion. CNN asked Hans-Georg Rodek, film critic of the respected German newspaper ""Die Weldt"" (The World), for his take on Cannes and the role of the critic. Georg Rodek: First of all, I never felt that critics have all the power. I'm just a film lover and I take that from my experience I'm entitled to talk a little authoritatively about films, that's all. No power. If 'Grace of Monaco was a marvellous film and the critics say it's bad film it will still be successful. But in this case -- and it's not always the case -- both audience and critics were united in saying 'Oh no!' CNN: So what exactly do you see as your role? HGR: It's something that humanity doesn't really need but it makes life easier because if you trust certain critics then you can say 'Ok, he says it's a good film and I never agree with him therefore it's a bad film and the other way around. So that's the way that criticism works. CNN: So you're providing a public service? HGR: Exactly. But I'm not a servant. I'm independent. I'm only responsible to myself. CNN: Sibelius, the composer, is often quoted as saying noone ever set up a statue to a critic. Do you sometimes think they should? HGR: Not to me, anyway. I think it may well happen some day. Not in Germany, where I come from , not in the U.S. and not in England but perhaps here in France. CNN: They take them seriously here? HGR: They take them seriously and they're right to do so but let's just say I'm not suffering from not enough exposure. CNN: So what do you enjoy about Cannes? HGR: I enjoy Cannes as I always enjoy Cannes as the only place on earth where you have the chance to see really exciting films nowadays. You don't always get them but let's say one out of five films I see here are really exciting and that's a much better quota than anywhere else. CNN: Tell me about one of your favorites in the competition. HGR: I feel that 'Winter Sleep,' the film by the Turkish director Nuri Bilge Ceylan is completely out of time. It is talky, it is long -- about three hours -- it is slow but it's an excellent film. CNN: And that's the film you like, right? HGR: That's the film that I like. It's not Bilge Ceylan's masterpiece but I like it exactly because it IS not of our times. It is against the times, it is not quick, it is not superficial and all that is something that you get very rarely these days. And that's it's main quality apart from the fact that it's masterfully crafted. CNN: Finally, how would you sum up in Cannes in three words? HGR: Sunny, ambitious and sometimes fulfilling!","At Cannes Film Festival, at least, the film critic is still alive and kicking .

"(CNN) -- France is the fifth richest country in the world. It is the world's sixth largest exporter. It has the second largest diplomatic network in the world, after the US. It is a member of the UN Security Council. It is the most visited country in the world, welcoming 82 million visitors last year. It is a major nuclear power. It is the true founder of the European Union. And it is in a terrible mess. Socialist Francois Hollande was elected president almost a year ago, ousting the deeply unpopular ""Mr Bling,"" President Nicolas Sarkozy. Read more: Francois Hollande - Fast Facts . France's Socialist left have never been so strong politically: They control the presidency, the government, both houses of parliament, the regions, and all the big towns and cities. And in his first eight months in office, Hollande has done virtually nothing. He is like a stunned bunny in the headlights of an oncoming vehicle called ""Harsh Economic Reality."" Hollande has three fundamental problems. The first is that he doesn't have a plan. Tens of thousands of people are losing their jobs each week, and it is going to get worse and worse. France faces a huge public spending crisis - in health, pensions, and now welfare, and a government debt of 90% of GDP. Not one single adequate measure has been put forward, nor even proposed in his eight months in office. Read more: What Hollande's victory means for Europe's economy . The second problem is that he lacks the political will to break the log-jams in French society: Making industry more competitive, reducing government spending. He cannot do these things because one of the constituencies he needs to take on -- the huge public sector -- is made up of the people who voted him into power. He could take on the equally irresponsible banks -- they didn't vote for him -- but he risks sending the economy into a tailspin if he does. And not only does he need to address the structural issues in France's economy and society, but he made the mistake of telling everyone he could solve the country's problems painlessly, or by taxing the super-rich, and he is not managing to do that either, so he is just taxing everyone else. Read more: FranÃ§ois Hollande: Left turn for France? Now he faces the worst situation possible because no one believes a word he says. He delivered a robust New Year's message last week, watched by millions; yet 75% don't believe he can deliver on its promise. In fact, the New Year's Eve wishes everyone in France did believe were the Churchillian tones of German Chancellor Angela Merkel. Her message was essentially the opposite of Hollande's bizarre optimism, which seems to involve little more than following the ""Keep Calm and Carry On"" mantra. But waiting for the upturn will find France unprepared and in a worse predicament than Spain or Italy, who are now busily restructuring their economies. The third and fundamental problem Hollande has is that he does not understand the nature of the office he holds, the French Presidency of the Republic. If he did, he might find a way forward. In his New Year message he likened himself to a ship's captain. But he has to be one, not just say he is one. The office of French President is a highly complex mixture of the political and the symbolic. But it is fundamentally about leadership; that is leading not following, and taking the French with him. Hollande urgently needs to reset his Presidency - and there are a few clear rules to do so: . He needs to take on the banks where necessary, take on the benefits system, the impediments to innovation and to setting up new businesses, take on the appalling situation of France's forgotten inner city misery; his need not be a hard-nosed liberal agenda. No government in French history is in a better position to make France a more equal society while making it and its economy more efficient. He should focus on young people trying to set up their own business. Focus on small businesses generally. Drag France away from its drive to over regulate everything and throttle innovation. Tax the super-rich if necessary, as long as it contributes to the overall solution he is aiming for. He also needs to get into step with Merkel and lead Europe with Germany, not pretend he is the spokesperson for the irresponsible spenders. But above all, he should use the presidency in a more imaginative way: Begin an ongoing and exciting conversation with the French. No other office in the world, not even the presidency of the US, offers such scope for an intimacy between leader and population. He should boldly use the referendum to build up and direct the conversation towards change and innovation. If the vested interests won't move, bring in the people. Use the referendum like de Gaulle did between 1958 and 1962, as a major political weapon to break the deadlocks in French political society. In Europe and the wider world he has to make France admired again, as it once was. Inside France, he has to forget about not upsetting anyone. In fact, he should have a plan that upsets just about everybody. The French would love him for it. So far it remains to be seen what impact his first major foreign policy challenge -- in Mali -- will have. As French forces, with the backing of the international community, go into the West African country to take on Islamist rebels, the coming weeks will tell us whether fate just gave to him the best or the worst opportunity to show the French, and the rest of the world, what he is made of.

"(Health.com) -- Curled up on a couch in New York City, clad in a white tank top and black track pants, Janet Jackson is ready to get personal. After nearly four decades in the spotlight -- from her debut on the classic TV sitcom ""Good Times"" to musical mega-stardom to roles in such acclaimed films as the new Tyler Perry drama, ""For Colored Girls"" -- the youngest Jackson sibling, 44, is feeling more comfortable than ever in her own skin. Here, the sweet, soft-spoken legend -- who released a CD of her number-one hits, ""Icon,"" in August and has a book coming out next month -- gets real about the pressures in Hollywood, working out, and what makes her happy now. Q: We're really excited about your upcoming book, ""True You,"" which covers self-esteem and healthy living. Why did you go that route instead of writing a straight-up autobiography? I guess I'm not finished with all that I want to do in life. You can write an autobiography at any point, and I'm not ready to yet. But in ""True You"" I tell a lot of stories about my life. I wanted to help people understand the things I've gone through to bring me where I am today, so they understand that journey of the weight loss, the weight gain, the self-esteem issues. I wanted to touch people and bring out the true you within yourself. Health.com: How do you find your feel great weight? Q: It seems like you're opening up more than ever to your fans. I want to paint a little picture for them. I want kids to pick [the book] up and say, ""OK, I can relate to this. I understand it."" I want it to be helpful because I know how I was as a kid, and what I needed and didn't get. It wasn't available to me. Q: People in the business started criticizing your body when you were just a kid, which must have been so difficult. Yeah, it was hard from a very early age. My first true experience with it was when I did ""Good Times,"" and they used to bind my chest because I was developing breasts at a young age. I got the part when I was 10 years old and started shooting when I was 11. I was a very quiet kid. A really sweet kid I might add. [Laughs.] I never said no. I said, ""OK, that's fine if that's what you want to do."" I would always cave in -- still as an adult I continued to [cave in]. I never told anybody that for so long. Not until I became an adult did anyone ever know. Q: That's a heavy thing to carry around. Yeah, and it immediately makes you think, ""The way I am isn't good enough."" That's the message that it sent to me: ""The way you look now isn't right."" And also on that show they thought I was too heavy and that I needed to lose weight. When I look back at the show, I was your average-size kid. Health.com: Brooke Shields on beauty, marriage, and self-esteem . Q: Would those comments make you mad? It would make me sad. It wouldn't make me mad. It would hurt. Q: Considering all that you've been through, what message would you like to send to young women? It starts with knowing who you are and loving yourself, not looking at this person and that person and saying, ""They look perfect, and they're a lot thinner than me."" Every body type is different -- that's what makes you unique. What makes you special is you, and you are different from the next person. And that really begins at home. Peer pressure is very tough. I have a niece who comes home from elementary school, and she's like, ""I've got to go work out!"" And I'm thinking, Are you serious? She's doing push-ups and sit-ups, and it's crazy. So be a kid as long as you can. Q: Do you like working out? I hate it. [Laughs.] I love my trainer, Tony, but we fight all the time. You know how some people like boot camp, where someone's yelling at you? That's the biggest way to turn me off. That will make me say, ""You know what? I'm not doing this."" But Tony is so sweet. He knows I love sports and games, so that's how he gets me. We'll do obstacle courses. He said recently, ""You've got to lift."" But right now, I just want to run and do ab work. So I'll run for maybe an hour. Health.com: Get the body you crave with celeb-inspired workouts . Q: What do you do to pass time on the treadmill? Listen to music. For a good run, I'll listen to old, funky stuff like Roger Troutman or Sly and the Family Stone -- something that makes me want to move. Or I'll watch the History Channel or old, classic films. Q: I was hoping you'd say you watch ""Jersey Shore."" No. [Laughs.] I've seen it a couple of times. Q: When it comes to your diet, are you still vegan? I was, but my trainer is constantly in my ear about not getting enough protein, so I started eating fish. When we were growing up, all of us kids were vegetarians. No one had asked me to stop eating meat -- I just noticed everyone else around me had stopped, so I followed the crew. And we were doing things like getting colonics, which was really progressive back then, being 11 years old. Health.com: Colonics: are they a waste of time? Q: You got a colonic at 11? Yeah, once a month my mother would drive us to downtown L.A. That played a big part in my life and career, because I learned at a very young age what discipline truly meant, to be able to pass up the French fries and the piece of candy. Q: Are there any diets you regret in retrospect? Something crazy? Yes, creating my own diet. It worked, but I wouldn't advise it for anyone. It was during the Rhythm Nation tour, and I had shot all the videos except for one, Love Will Never Do (Without You). I actually wanted to wear a dress, because I was so covered up from head to toe. And then [director] Herb [Ritts] said, ""Why don't you wear jeans and show your midriff?"" And I said, ""OK, I'm down for that."" And I decided to have an apple and one small bag of tortilla chips a day. That's all I ate. This is awful ... this is not the thing to do. I did that for maybe a week-and-a-half, two weeks. Plus, I was riding the bike every day. I don't care what hour I'd get back at night -- it may have been one in the morning, and I would be on that bike for an hour. And I lost a lot of weight. But I gained it back and more after that. Health.com: How crash diets harm your health . Q: Do you have a favorite part of your body? The small of my back, because it's the part I can't see. [Laughs.] I see everything else every day. No, I like the shape of it. Q: Is there a celebrity whose body you think is gorgeous? Naomi Campbell's. It's beautiful. I've always said if I could have one person's legs, they would be Naomi's. They're beautiful and long. Q: Why do you think people are so obsessed with who's thin and fat in Hollywood? It's one thing to be fitness-obsessed in a positive way, but it's become too negative. I've seen photographs of people in bikinis, circled where they have cellulite. But it's like, look, we're all human. Some of the thinnest models have cellulite, it's genetic. I think it's mean-spirited. People tend to put entertainers on pedestals. We're human beings, just like you. You may see us smiling, and whether we have money or not, we still have bills to pay, we still have our stresses. I think a lot of people want to focus on others' shortcomings to make themselves feel better. And it's a very sad thing. Health.com: Fight cellulite fast with yoga . Q: What makes you happy? The beach really calms and relaxes me. That's why I'm always running to an island if I can. I love to travel! Another very important thing is your support team -- who you surround yourself with, whether it's at work or at home. Q: If you had to choose between acting and singing, which would you pick? That would be hard. Singing will always be a part of my life. But I have more of a passion for acting than I do singing, because singing comes so much easier to me. Acting is more of a challenge. I always say to people, ""I'm really in the wrong business because I don't like being in front of huge crowds, and I don't like it when a lot of people are looking at me."" Q: Seriously? It really is the truth. But when I'm on stage, I'm constantly moving. In a film you're completely naked. Music can be that way, too, if you allow it to be when you write. And I think I've allowed myself to be vulnerable several times with my music. But acting is a challenge for me, and I love that.

"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- Gale Storm, whose acting and singing talents earned her three stars on Hollywood's Walk of Fame, died Saturday, according to a Danville, California nursing facility where she was a patient. Storm was 87. Storm got her first movie contract, a stage name and a husband when she won a radio talent show in Hollywood at the age of 17. Her first TV show -- ""My Little Margie"" -- set the sitcom stage with Lucille Ball and other female stars in the 1950s, said Skip E. Lowe, a longtime friend who acted in some of Storm's first movies in the early 1940s. ""She was a wonderful singer,"" said Lowe. ""She started as a singer and became known as an actress and singer."" Born Josephine Owaissa Cottle in Bloomington, Texas, in 1922, she entered and won a CBS Radio talent show that offered a grand prize of a one-year movie contract with RKO Studio, according to her personal biography. She teamed up with the male winner, Lee Bonnell, whom she married and had four children with. The couple remained married for 45 years until his death in 1986. ""We fell deeply in love and were married two years later, just as soon as my mother would allow it!"" she wrote. The new name Gale Storm was also part of the prize, she said. Lowe, who interviewed her several times in recent decades on his cable TV show, said Storm was open about her bout with alcoholism. ""She was battling that bottle,"" Lowe said. Storm wrote about her alcoholism on her official Web site: . ""My successes have certainly not been without problems. During the 1970s I experienced a terribly low and painful time of dealing with alcoholism. I had Lee's unfailing support through the entire ordeal. My treatment and recovery were more than rugged."" Storm said she was ""fully recovered for more than 20 years."" She also chronicled her alcoholism battle in an autobiography published in 1980 and titled ""I Ain't Down Yet."" Her work in movies in the 1940s when she starred in dozens of B-movies -- mostly Westerns -- was great preparation when television became big in the early 1950s, she said. Her first TV series, ""My Little Margie"" was a radio show transferred to TV as a summer replacement for ""I Love Lucy"" in 1952. ""I was overwhelmed by the immediate success of it,"" she said. ""During the next four years, millions of people saw the 126 episodes of 'Margie' on TV and listened to separate, live episodes on network radio,"" Storm said. Her next sitcom was ""The Gale Storm Show: Oh! Susanna,"" airing from 1956 until 1960. Storm played the social director on a cruise ship. Along with film, radio and TV, Storm recorded several top-10 pop hits for Dot Records in the 1950s. ""I was thrilled when my very first record, 'I Hear You Knockin' ,' sold over a million copies and won for me the coveted 'gold' record,"" she wrote. ""After that, my hit records included 'Dark Moon,' 'Ivory Tower,' 'Teen Age Prayer,' and 'Memories Are Made Of This .'"" Her three Hollywood Walk of Fame stars are for recording, radio and television, according to the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce. She acted in a few TV episodes in the 1980s, including ""The Love Boat"" and ""Murder She Wrote."" Storm married Paul Masterson in 1988 after Bonnell died. Her second husband died in 1996.","Her first TV show , ""My Little Margie,"" set the sitcom stage with Lucille Ball .

"(CNN) -- After completing his second year of business classes at Miles College in Fairfield, Alabama, in 2007, Joshua Armstrong decided to take a break from full-time studies. Armstrong who had been insured through his parents' health insurance policy, thought he would remain on that plan until he finished school and found a job offering health benefits. So, he didn't seek out another policy on his own during his break. Then, in January 2008, Armstrong, who was 21 years old at the time, was rushed to the emergency room after a car accident. He was treated for a broken ankle, minor scrapes and bruises and was given a prescription for painkillers. A few months later his parents, Delores and Isaac Armstrong, received the $10,000 emergency room bill. ""The hospital had sent the bill back to us because insurance wouldn't pay,"" recalls Delores Armstrong, who says she was speechless when she saw the expense. ""That was when we learned our insurance carrier only allowed Joshua to be covered as long as he was a full-time student."" The Armstrongs' story is familiar to many young adults and their families, and the frustration of being uninsured is taking its toll on people of all age groups. Thursday, six months after the Affordable Care Act was enacted, several provisions go into effect. Health officials are hoping this first wave of changes will ""put consumers in charge of their health care."" This week, President Obama unveiled a website to help provide critical information to consumers regarding the legislation. Earlier this week, a key group of economists announced an official end to what the Obama administration is calling the worst recession since the 1930s. However, the impact is still being felt across the nation. A recent population report from the U.S. Census Bureau says there has been a dramatic increase in the number of people without health insurance in the United States. Between 2008 and 2009, the number of uninsured people increased by 16.7 percent, to nearly 51 million. An estimated 6.5 million people were no longer covered by private health insurance and equally as many had lost employment-based health benefits. Patient advocates say Thursday's changes are only the beginning. ""The big resolutions will come in 2014 when you will start to see tens of millions of people getting coverage,"" says Avram Goldstein, communication director for the Health Care for America Now, a liberal grass roots health advocacy organization. It offers a detailed timeline of what changes consumers can expect over the next few years. Recent polls show many Americans remain divided over the reforms. A CNN/Opinion Research Corp. national poll conducted earlier this month indicates that 46 percent of the public feels Democrats in Congress will do a better job on health care, while 45 percent say congressional Republicans would do a better job on the issue. Similarly, a recent CBS News/New York Times survey found 37 percent of participants approved of the new health care law. Several Republican lawmakers have also called for a repeal by co-sponsoring what they call the Reform Americans Can Afford Act. As the debate continues, CNN will continue to highlight the latest changes that affect you. Here are six provisions that could affect you immediately if you purchase a new plan starting Thursday. For people who have an existing health care plan, these changes will take effect during open enrollment if you are covered through your employer, or when your current policy renews if you purchased a plan on the individual market. Young people can remain on parents' insurance until age 26 . The health care reform legislation requires insurance companies to allow dependent children to remain on their parents' insurance policies until their 26th birthday. The children can't have jobs that offer insurance. According to the Department of Health and Human Services, several health insurers began early implementation of this policy in May, months ahead of the September 23 deadline. Until Thursday, in most states dependents were booted off their parent's health insurance policy before age 26, sometimes as early as age 19. A handful of states allow dependents to remain on a parent's policy until age 30, and HHS says those locations will continue to do so. To find out the specifics for your state, go to Gettingcovered.org and look at the state facts or check the state-by-state ""definition of dependency"" list from the Kaiser Family Foundation. No discrimination against children with pre-existing conditions . Starting Thursday, consumer protections prohibit all employer plans and all new plans in the individual market from denying coverage to children age 18 and younger who have pre-existing conditions. However, ahead of this provision, several large health insurance companies announced plans to suspend child-only insurance policies because of concerns over clarity of the new rules, as well as reservations that the provisions create an ""unlevel playing field."" ""Given the current uncertainty in the niche marketplace for child-only coverage, health plans have to make very difficult decisions about the types of new policies they will offer,"" says Robert Zirkelbach, press secretary for America's Health Insurance Plans, the national association representing health insurance providers. ""While well intended, the current regulation provides a powerful incentive for parents to wait to purchase coverage until after their children become sick,"" Zirkelbach says. ""I think it's very unfortunate that the insurance companies continue to make decisions on the backs of children and families that need their help,"" White House press secretary Robert Gibbs told reporters on Tuesday. He said that even though child-only policies represent a small portion of the individual market, the goal is to make sure nobody falls through the cracks. If you have a child-only policy, you can keep it, America's Health Insurance Plans says. If you were planning to purchase a child-only policy but have learned it is no longer offered by your insurance carrier, your child may qualify for SCHIP, the State Children's Health Insurance Program. Here is a state-by-state directory of SCHIP programs. Adults who can't get insurance because of a pre-existing condition can look for a Pre-Existing Condition Insurance Plan (PCIP). Visit PCIP.gov to find out whether you are eligible and to learn more about what the monthly premiums are in your state. No dropping people from coverage when they get sick . Insurance companies can no longer drop a customer when that person gets sick, nor can they look for errors on your insurance application and then not pay for a service when you get sick. No lifetime limits on coverage . If you purchase a new health policy on or after Thursday, the Affordable Care Act prohibits that plan from placing a lifetime cap on the coverage you can receive for hospital stays and other expenses associated with your condition. Keep in mind that this does not include the use of annual dollar limits, which will be phased out over the next three years, and will be banned by 2014. New plans must offer free preventive care . If you purchase a new health policy on or after Thursday, certain preventive screenings, immunizations and tests must be covered without your having to pay a copayment, coinsurance or meet your deductible when these services are delivered by a network provider. If you are already insured, these services should be offered to you during open enrollment, or when your individual policy renews. A full list of the preventive services covered under the Affordable Care Act can be found on Healthcare.gov. Expanded ability to appeal decisions made by the health plan . Under current rules, when an insurer denies you coverage, you really didn't have many options. About 44 states provide for some form of external appeal and the laws governing these processes vary greatly. If you buy or join a new policy starting Thursday, you should be able to appeal to an independent third party. According to Jay Angoff, the director of the Office of Consumer Information and Insurance for Health and Human Services, your health insurance company is required to inform you of how to access the independent, objective reviewer. Another resource if you have questions about whether the appeal process applies to you is your state insurance regulator. Also, later this fall, you will be able to find state-by-state lists of consumer assistance programs on Healthcare.gov. Joshua Armstrong, now 23, is on a payment plan to repay the $10,000 hospital bill he amassed after his vehicle accident. ""It's been really tough,"" says Armstrong, ""I didn't know an emergency room could be that expensive."" He and his mother are excited about this week's health care reform provisions and are planning to attend one of several nationwide educational events on Thursday being sponsored by the group Getting Covered to figure out what they need to do make sure Joshua will be insured in the future.

"(CNN) -- You may have never heard of Lavabit and Silent Circle. That's because they offered encrypted (secure) e-mail services, something most Americans have probably never thought about needing, or wanting. In recent days, Lavabit closed shop reportedly in response to U.S. government pressure to hand over customer data, including those of Edward Snowden, who used the e-mail provider. Silent Circle, which is used by activists, journalists and diplomats, shut down its e-mail service on its own volition because it wanted to prevent spying. While these small companies have the courage to stand up for their customers' privacy, big companies like Google and Microsoft and others seem to be on the sidelines. Opinion: The Internet is a surveillance state . We seem to be of several minds about government surveillance of our communications. Most people want privacy. But most people want the government, at least in justified cases, to be able to read the e-mail of those legitimately suspected of planning serious crimes. And most people also find the details of electronic surveillance worrying and complicated, and would prefer not to think about them at all. It's easier to stick your head in the sand. But that would be a mistake. E-mail privacy matters because our intellectual privacy matters. The ability to confidentially share ideas and information between friends, confidantes and loved ones is the hallmark of a free society. Our communications are the foundation of our political freedoms. They must be inaccessible to the government unless it can prove to a neutral judge that surveillance is warranted, which means more than ""relevance"" to an investigation and more than mere curiosity. Opinion: NSA secrets kill our trust . Governments that have the power to secretly watch their citizens and are not subject to meaningful legal constraint have proven, time and time again, that this power can be abused. Just look at our own history. J. Edgar Hoover's FBI put the Rev. Martin Luther King under surveillance, seeking to discredit him politically. This was part of a broader program called COINTELPRO. Hoover told FBI agents to ""expose, disrupt, misdirect, discredit, or otherwise neutralize"" the activities of a wide range of individuals and groups, including communists, civil rights organizations, anti-Vietnam War groups, and so on. When earlier this year Edward Snowden leaked to the world NSA's massive surveillance programs such as PRISM and Boundless Informant, we were shocked. But more revelations kept coming. Just the other day, the Washington Post reported that the NSA had broken its own permissive rules on surveillance thousands of times each year since 2008. This is unacceptable. A society that cannot trust its citizens with ideas -- dissenting, different, or even dangerous -- is a society that is incapable of governing itself. It's in this context that we should understand the importance of the recent closures of Lavabit and Silent Circle's e-mail service. Our government has the power to secretly compel e-mail providers to allow surveillance. These secret powers are frequently subject to minimal legal checks, and they allow the government to put gag orders on e-mail providers who object to turning over the records of their customers' communications. When e-mail providers build their systems in ways to ensure privacy (such as by not collecting metadata or by using strong encryption), they come under government pressure, as Lavabit found out to its dismay. How can we protect e-mail privacy in ways that give the government the power (subject to the meaningful rule of law) to investigate serious crimes? We could let the government record everything, see everything and know everything. This seems to be the position of some government officials, but it would be the end of privacy (and self-government) as we know it. If we know the state is watching, we will censor what we do, what we say, and possibly even what we think. On the other hand, we could put our communications under strong legal or technological protection (like cryptography) subject to no government access. This would guarantee strong privacy, but it could unreasonably handicap the government from legitimate law enforcement and counter-terrorism purposes. There is a middle way. We should presume the privacy of e-mail and other communications, and we should require the government to get warrants supported by probable cause before it can read our mail, track our movements and use our communications data to construct a map of everyone we know and when we talk to them. This is the traditional way we've protected communications privacy, and it's a good way. But this requires recognizing a few things. Total surveillance of our communications is illegitimate, but so is secret surveillance. In a democracy committed to civil liberties, the basic contours of government power must be known by the people, so that the people can agree to them. It's not enough for government agencies to raise the specter of public safety and say ""trust us."" A common response to this argument is the idea that making government surveillance powers public makes it easier for criminals and terrorists to commit crimes, and harder for the police to do their jobs. This is correct, but we need to acknowledge that privacy is a civil liberty, and civil liberties are inefficient. We tolerate free speech, the freedom from searches and seizures, jury trials, and the privilege against self-incrimination (among others) in spite of these costs because we've learned the hard way that the alternative is worse. Governments that are too efficient abuse their powers, often by trampling political dissent and civil liberties. It's the difference between a police state and a free state. We can't ignore the threat to our civil liberties by giving the government vast powers any more than we can ignore the fact that we live in a dangerous world. Striking the right balance might be hard, but it is part of the price we have to pay for political freedom. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Neil Richards.","Lavabit, a secure e-mail service, chose to shut down rather than give customer data to the state .

"(CNN) -- It's time to get beyond the question of who's to blame for the crisis along the U.S.-Mexico border, where tens of thousands of children -- three-fourths of them from Honduras, Guatemala, or El Salvador -- are streaming into the United States and overwhelming our border enforcement apparatus. We have to focus on workable solutions and skip half-baked ideas that make the problem worse. Unfortunately, neither President Obama nor congressional Republicans are bringing their A-game. You know who did bring theirs? The human smuggling cartels. The White House recently acknowledged that ""criminal syndicates"" planted fake media reports on foreign television networks telling desperate would-be migrants that Congress had passed an amnesty and urging people to go north immediately for their ""permisos"" (permits) to live legally in the United States. Helping what is now nearly 100,000 young people cross the U.S.-Mexico border, at $8,000 per head, the bad guys earned about $800 million. It was a brilliant plan, and an evil one. How are our leaders responding? The results are not impressive. Republicans insist that Obama is to blame for the surge because of an accommodation he offered young undocumented immigrants in 2012. Rep. Darrell Issa, R-California, is demanding that Obama end the program known as Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, which lets young undocumented immigrants who were brought here as children avoid deportation and apply for a work permit, and which Issa claims -- with no evidence to back it up -- is responsible for the flood of children across the border. Never mind that none of the children now crossing into the country is eligible for DACA, because anyone who enters the country after June 15, 2007, does not qualify for the program. Never mind that, if DACA were to blame for the influx, it would have happened two years ago. Never mind that the real reason so many of these kids have been turned over to family members in the United States while awaiting a court date isn't DACA. It's because of a longstanding but unspoken policy by the Border Patrol to treat unaccompanied minors differently from adults -- and a 2008 law signed by President George W. Bush that prohibits Border Patrol agents from sending them back across the border. It instead requires that they be handed over to the Department of Health and Human Services until they can be placed in the custody of a relative. Meanwhile, Obama is being just as thickheaded -- and hardhearted. He will soon ask Congress to provide more than $2 billion in new funding to bolster enforcement on the border. By all means, because the tens of billions that we spend on securing the homeland -- including the $38.2 billion that Obama and Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson requested from Congress in the fiscal year 2015 budget request -- have been so effective in tightening the border. Obama also wants additional powers for the executive branch so that immigration officials can speed up the removal of young unaccompanied minors without the nuisance of having to administer due process, including access to legal counsel. And to think that Obama was once a university lecturer on constitutional law. He needs a refresher course. This is how Obama deals with what he has called a ""humanitarian crisis""? What is humane about taking children who have already been through so much pain and suffering -- some of whom were, according to reports, sexually assaulted and threatened by street gangs in Central America -- and express shipping them back to those hellholes? Here are five things the President should do: . -- As House Speaker John Boehner suggested a few weeks ago, Obama should send in the National Guard to help the Border Patrol, which is overwhelmed, outnumbered, and occupied as a babysitter. In 2006, Bush sent 6,000 National Guard troops to the U.S.-Mexico border, in a supporting role, to help Border Patrol agents by repairing fence line and fixing vehicles and thus allowing the agents to patrol the border. -- Obama needs to suspend the Border Patrol's policy of allowing unaccompanied minors to stay in the United States with relatives. Young people need to be held by U.S. immigration officials until they can be brought before an immigration judge to determine if they should be deported or whether they have a legitimate claim to refugee status. Since current law says that unaccompanied minors have to be placed with relatives within 72 hours, we have to make sure that they get before a judge within that time period. It's not ideal. But changes have to be made, since the current system has been compromised by smugglers who are using it to line their pockets. -- Children in the custody of U.S. immigration officials, some of whom are as young as 5, must be treated compassionately. They have to be placed in decent, temperature-controlled holding rooms with sanitary conditions and adequate toilet facilities, and given sufficient food and prescribed medicine. They're not prisoners. They're guests of this country, until an immigration judge says otherwise. -- Asylum hearings need to be expedited for children from Central America to determine if they qualify for refugee status. Lawyers must be provided. The government can have hearings for groups of immigrants at one time, in order to speed things up. We simply cannot deport any young person who faces a legitimate threat of violence back home. It could be a death sentence. -- Some of these kids are going to have to be deported back to their home countries, in the most public and conspicuous manner possible, so that other people who are thinking about coming here reconsider. The administration has been smart in placing public service announcements in foreign media, telling people they've been lied to and that there are no ""permisos."" This is a battle of competing messages, and we have to win. This crisis was years in the making. Cleaning it up will take time and effort. What are we waiting for? Let's get started.","Ruben Navarrette: Blame game over immigrant kids streaming in from Central America is useless .

"(CNN) -- Attorneys for Casey Anthony and Zenaida Gonzalez, the woman who has filed a civil suit against her, return to court Thursday to argue whether Anthony should fully answer questions posed to her during her deposition in October. In that hearing, Anthony's lawyers invoked her Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination 60 times. Attorneys for Gonzalez want the court to compel her to answer. Gonzalez's defamation lawsuit alleges that Anthony falsely accused her of kidnapping her 2-year-old daughter, Caylee Anthony. Gonzalez alleges that Anthony defamed her and damaged her reputation when she claimed that a nanny named Zenaida Fernandez-Gonzalez had taken Caylee, who was reported missing in July 2008 -- a month after she was last seen. Authorities were never able to find the nanny. But they did find Gonzalez, who claimed she never met Anthony or her daughter. Anthony's civil attorneys have argued that she never identified this specific woman as the ""Zenaida Gonzalez"" she was talking about. Gonzalez's attorneys claim, according to questions asked of Anthony in the October 8 deposition, that Gonzalez was questioned by the police in Caylee's disappearance, was kicked out of her apartment complex, lost her job and that she and her two daughters received death threats as a result of media attention in the case. Anthony herself said little in the deposition, but did acknowledge she was aware she was being sued by Gonzalez. She also said she had not spoken to her brother, Lee, in the previous six months, and had not spoken to her parents, George and Cindy Anthony, since October 14, 2008. However, her attorney, Charles Greene, did not permit her to answer questions including whether she had ever met Gonzalez; whether a person named Zenaida was ever a nanny to Caylee; or whether defense attorney Jose Baez's assertion during Anthony's criminal trial that Zenaida Gonzalez was one of Anthony's ""imaginary friends,"" was true. She also was not allowed to answer questions about whether she considered herself a good mother to Caylee; the last day she saw the 2-year-old alive; and whether she drowned in the Anthonys' pool in June 2008, as the defense claimed during Anthony's criminal trial. While Anthony was acquitted on murder charges in Caylee's death, she was convicted on four counts of lying to authorities investigating the child's disappearance. She was given credit for time already spent behind bars, however, and was released from jail July 17. Gonzalez was deposed for about 12 hours last month by Anthony's attorneys.","Anthony's attorneys invoked her Fifth Amendment rights 60 times in a previous hearing .

"(CNN) -- Rapper Heavy D died of a blood clot in his lung and other conditions, a coroner's report revealed Tuesday. The rapper, famous for the 1991 hit ""Now That We Found Love,"" died Nov. 8 after collapsing at his Beverly Hills home. The Los Angeles County Department of Coroner determined the 44-year-old died of a pulmonary embolism, deep leg vein thrombosis, and arteriosclerotic cardiovascular disease. Heavy D, whose real name is Dwight Errington Myers, was found conscious with difficulty breathing at his home after police were called, the Beverly Hills police said. He was pronounced dead in the emergency room at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center later that day, officials said. While his hip-hop recording career began in 1987 with his group Heavy D & the Boyz, his breakthrough came in 1991 with a remake of the O'Jays' ""Now That We Found Love."" Heavy D's rapping was featured on Janet Jackson's 1990 hit ""Alright."" He also rapped on Michael Jackson's 1991 hit ""Jam,"" which he performed at October's Michael Jackson tribute show in Cardiff, Wales. He also composed and performed the theme songs several television shows, including ""In Living Color,"" ""MADtv"" and ""The Tracy Morgan Show."" His last album, ""Love Opus,"" was released this year. Heavy D also pursued an acting career, which included mostly roles on TV shows and movies. He played a courthouse guard in the Eddie Murphy film ""Tower Heist,"" released last month. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) are serious medical conditions that are often undiagnosed, but they are preventable, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. DVT occurs when a blood clot forms in a deep vein, usually in the lower leg, thigh or pelvis. It can happen to anyone, but there are many risk factors that increase the chances of developing the condition. Among those factors is obesity, and Heavy D was known for being overweight. PE is the most serious complication of DVT and happens when part of the clot breaks off and travels through the bloodstream to the lungs, the CDC says. People may recover from having a small clot, but a large one can stop blood from reaching the lungs and is fatal.

"NEW YORK (CNN) -- A man who stored nearly 1,500 pounds of potassium nitrate and other chemicals in his Staten Island home and a nearby storage facility was charged with reckless endangerment Friday, according to the New York City Police Department. Police said Miguel Serrano, 57, had bought the chemicals in bulk from an Ohio-based dealer and was intending to resell them in smaller quantities on the Internet. It was the dealer who tipped off the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives after Serrano had ordered 5,000 pounds of potassium nitrate, according to a police report. According to New York Police Sgt. Kevin Hayes, authorities found less than a thousand pounds of chemicals in the home, including potassium nitrate, sulfur, mercury, and peroxide. At the off-site storage facility, authorities found about 1,500 pounds of chemicals, mainly potassium nitrate. Late Thursday night, several residential blocks were cordoned off and a few dozen homes were evacuated in Staten Island as police searched Serrano's home and a nearby commercial storage facility. The NYPD's Paul Brown said there is no indication the chemicals were being used for bomb-making or anything terror-related. According to Brown, the man was buying the chemicals in bulk and reselling them on the Internet. Potassium nitrate can be used to make gunpowder and rocket fuel or to clean septic tanks. It can also be used to cure meats. Police said Serrano has been cooperating with investigators. ATF officials said no violations of federal explosives laws were discovered, but added that chemical-storage rules may have been violated. Small quantities of hydrogen peroxide, potassium permanganate, elemental mercury, iodine, sulfur, ammonium dichromate, and aluminum powder were also recovered during the raid, police said.

"Los Angeles, California (CNN) -- Actress Zsa Zsa Gabor was rushed to a Los Angeles hospital Friday after her doctor diagnosed her with ""a massive blood clot,"" her publicist said. Gabor's left leg was ""swollen like hell"" and she had an infection in her right leg, her husband, Prince Frederic Von Anhalt, said Friday evening, as his wife was being treated in the emergency room at Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center. She had ""no blood flow to her leg,"" Von Anhalt said. Gabor ""was complaining about her leg swelling and hurting her"" Friday morning, so a doctor was called to her Bel Air, California, home, publicist John Blanchette said. The doctor diagnosed Gabor with a ""massive blood clot,"" which he feared could move from her leg to her heart, Blanchette said. Paramedics took Gabor, 93, to Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center, where she had undergone hip replacement surgery in July, he said. She spent several weeks in the hospital over the summer. She has been frail and ""pretty much confined to a wheelchair"" since a 2002 car accident, Von Anhalt said. The crash happened when the car in which she was riding with her hairdresser slammed into a light pole on Sunset Boulevard in Los Angeles.

"(CNN) -- Sens. Hillary Clinton and John McCain are pushing for a gas-tax holiday, but Sen. Barack Obama says the plan is a quick fix that would do more harm than good. Sen. Hillary Clinton campaigns this week in Wilmington, North Carolina. Gov. Mike Easley has endorsed her. McCain, the presumptive Republican nominee, was the first to propose a temporary suspension of the federal gas tax. His plan would lift the 18.4 cents per gallon tax during peak summer travel months. It also would suspend the 24.4 cent diesel tax. Clinton, who rejected a similar idea in 2000, said her plan is different from McCain's. She said the Republican's proposal would cost the government up to $10 billion -- money that is used to improve roads. The senator from New York said she'd make up for the lost revenue with a ""windfall profits tax"" on oil companies, meaning their profits over a certain amount would be subject to a 50 percent tax. Her plan also would close $7.5 billion in oil and gas loopholes as well as monitor prices for manipulation.  Watch how candidates plan to deal with soaring gas prices » . Obama does not support a suspension of the gas tax, which he described as a political scheme that would save the average driver $25 to $28. ""It's typical of how Washington works -- let's find some short-term, quick fix, even though we're not really doing anything,"" he said.  Watch an analysis of how the candidates' plans differ » . Instead, Obama would use a windfall profits tax on oil companies to help low-income families pay their energy bills. He also insists he would put forth more effort than others to limit oil companies' influence in Washington. Analysts and Obama said the proposal to suspend the tax temporarily would do little to stimulate the economy or lower gas prices and could leave roads in disrepair. ""It's a quick fix for people who believe cheap gas is their birthright,"" said Tom Kloza, chief oil analyst at the research firm Oil Price Information Service. ""It's not a prudent thing to do."" Kloza said the amount of money motorists would save would do little to stimulate economic growth. The revenue from the gas tax is much needed for road repairs, he added. ""Look, somewhere down the road you have to use less,"" Kloza said. ""As painful as it might be, higher prices do sway behavior toward a more energy disciplined America."" Obama is using the issue to liken Clinton to McCain, while she is trying to paint Obama as out of touch with working-class voters -- a group that will play a big role in the upcoming Indiana primary. Indiana and North Carolina both hold their primaries next Tuesday. Obama leads Clinton in the overall delegate count, 1,725 to 1,588. Clinton has a slight edge in superdelegates, leading Obama 256 to 234. Since neither candidate can capture the 2,025 delegates needed to secure the nomination with wins in the remaining contests, the party's superdelegates probably will decide who gets the Democratic nod. Superdelegates are party leaders and officials who vote at the August convention for the candidate of their choice. North Carolina Gov. Mike Easley, a superdelegate, endorsed Clinton on Tuesday.   Recent polling suggests Obama holds a double-digit lead over the former first lady in that state, though no surveys have been released since Clinton's win in Pennsylvania last week. After attending a rally with Easley in Raleigh, Clinton is scheduled to head to Indiana for events in Indianapolis, Hobart and Princeton. Obama also is in North Carolina, where he has town hall-style meetings scheduled Tuesday in Winston-Salem and Hickory. McCain continues his weeklong health care tour, with a speech Tuesday in Tampa, Florida. McCain opposes federally mandated universal coverage.

"(CNN) -- David Beckham was always adept at curling the ball around a wall -- but when it came to the barrier of homosexuality in football, he broke straight through it. Former England captain Beckham, who announced his retirement from football Thursday, was the first superstar footballer to embrace his ""gay icon"" status, freely giving interviews to gay magazines and openly talking about his gay fan base. That attitude was the catalyst for a change, according to author and journalist, Chas Newkey-Burden. ""What David Beckham did was break the long silence about homosexuality in football,"" Newkey-Burden told CNN. ""Before Beckham came along, it was basically a taboo but he changed all that. ""He openly courted his gay fan base, saying he loved being a gay icon and was happy for his wife to broadcast that around. ""He was the first to give interviews to gay magazines -- before that, no footballer would have done that. ""He also changed the way footballers were looked at. He was inherently good looking, but it was that he paid so much attention to his appearance that was unprecedented."" In an interview with the BBC given in 2007, Beckham spoke of his pride at being tagged as a ""gay icon"". ""Maybe it's things like (the fact) I like to look after myself, I like to look smart and presentable most of the time,"" he said at the time. ""I always liked to look good, even when I was a little kid. I was given the option when I was a page boy once of either wearing a suit or wearing knickerbockers and long socks and ballet shoes -- and I chose the ballet shoes and knickerbockers."" Once Newkey-Burden spent five months trying to organize an interview with the midfielder, only for the player himself to sanction the piece after reading one of the journalist's articles on football and homosexuality in Four Four Two magazine. ""David read the piece I did about how far football had come in dealing with homophobia,"" Newkey-Burden recalled. ""I know he was very moved by the fact I wrote how he had opened the door to change and that is what swung getting me the interview with him. ""Look, there are 92 league clubs in England with each squad having around 20 players, so statistically, there must be some gay players, "" added the journalist. ""One day it will be common place for footballers to come out and David Beckham will have played a part in that. ""He opened the door and it is the person who opens the door who makes the difference. ""Beckham said to the world: 'I'm straight, I'm the England captain and I think it's cool people are gay.'"" Despite Beckham embracing his ""gay icon"" status, football continues to struggle with homophobia. Last February, U.S. football star Robbie Rogers announced he was retiring from football after ""coming out"" -- leaving Swedish player Anton Hysen as the only openly gay player in Europe. Rogers might yet make a return given he has been training with Los Angeles Galaxy. Beckham was also key in footballers becoming fashionistas and attracting interest from the mainstream media, according to Newkey Burden. ""Gay football fans don't want 11 neatly coiffured and manicured players to admire,"" said the journalist and celebrity biographer who has written books about Adele, Brangelina, Michael Jackson and Paris Hilton. ""They're more attracted to the old-fashioned kind of player like Vinny Jones or Alan Shearer if I'm honest. ""But Beckham was someone who was proud to be a gay icon and made it cool too. ""Just look at the number of metrosexuals who have emerged since Beckham. ""It's now OK for players to have silly, floppy hair and dress in the way they do. He did that."" Players now try to trend it like Beckham more often than they try to bend it like Beckham. From wearing his wife's underwear to parading around in a sarong, the former Manchester United, Real Madrid, LA Galaxy, AC Milan and Paris Saint-Germain man has never been one to shy away from experimentation. While former Spice Girl Victoria has gone on to establish herself as a leading fashion designer, it is Beckham who brought men into the 21st century with his eye for the latest trends. From his outrageous hair styles to his love of grooming and moisturizing, Beckham relaunched the notion of the metroxsexual along with his very own brand of cologne. Whether it was by provocatively modelng in his Armani underwear or being paraded in front of the press in another exquisitely tailored suit, Beckham set the bar high when it came to looking sharp. ""Beckham was the antithesis to the godawful lad culture of the late Nineties,"" GQ.co.uk fashion editor Nick Carvell told CNN. ""Being a footballer who was clearly motivated by fashion trends and absolutely loved clothes, he turned the idea of what it meant to be a stylish sportsman at the time on its head. ""Sure he made some mistakes along the way (cornrows), but that's what made him a trendsetter -- he always led and never followed. ""He was certainly one of the first celebrities to de-stigmatize grooming pursuits that were previously seen as girls-only (his early penchant for highlights comes to mind). ""Lots of people would say that it helps he has an athlete's body, but there are plenty of sportsman who dress appallingly. ""I think it's his willingness to try new things combined with a clear appreciation for a good tailor. ""He might have worn the occasional eye-raising get-up when he was younger, but it always fitted perfectly."" That infamous sarong, which he was pictured wearing in 1998, was certainly one ""eye-raising item"" but as Newkey-Burden explains, Beckham had no regrets. ""When I interviewed him in 2006, I asked Beckham if he regretted wearing that 'dress'. He said: 'No, that's one of the things I'd do again!'""","Beckham 'opened the door' for it to be cool to be gay .

"(CNN) -- A top White House aide assigned to review problems at the Department of Veterans Affairs is going to Phoenix, where CNN reported that fraudulent records -- including secret lists -- covered up allegedly deadly waiting periods for veterans to get care. White House spokesman Jay Carney told reporters on Tuesday that Rob Nabors, the deputy chief of staff helping the review by Veterans Affairs Secretary Eric Shinseki, will head to Phoenix on Wednesday night to interview the interim director of the VA office and visit the facility. However, Carney stepped around questions about when President Barack Obama learned of the depth of the VA problems as the controversy continued to dog the administration. Meanwhile, the number of Veterans Affairs facilities under investigation has expanded to 26, the agency's Office of Inspector General confirmed Tuesday. Last week, the inspector general told a Senate committee that 10 facilities were being investigated. For six months, CNN has been reporting on delays in medical appointments for veterans across the country, with some dying or suffering harm while waiting for appointments and care. CNN reveals Phoenix problems . The most disturbing and striking problems emerged in Arizona last month, with sources revealing to CNN details of a secret waiting list for veterans at the Phoenix VA. According to the sources, at least 40 American veterans died in Phoenix while waiting for care at the VA there. Now, an internal VA memo from 2010, first disclosed at a congressional hearing last week, showed officials warned of ""inappropriate scheduling practices"" to cover up excessive waits for veterans four years ago. The memo by William Schoenhard, who was a VA deputy undersecretary, referred to a growing practice of ""gaming strategies"" that he said would not be tolerated. However, the CNN investigation shows such practices have continued. In response to CNN's reporting, the VA has acknowledged 23 deaths across the country due to excessive waits by veterans for care, and the VA inspector general launched an independent investigation of the Phoenix allegations and other VA problems, in addition to the internal review by Shinseki and Nabors. At last week's Senate hearing, the inspector general said his investigation so far found a possible 17 deaths of veterans waiting for care in Phoenix, but added there was no evidence that the excessive waiting caused the deaths. Internal memo . On Monday, Carney had acknowledged the White House learned of the situation at the Phoenix VA from CNN reports in April. Asked Tuesday about the Schoenhard memo, Carney refused to answer and instead referred reporters to the VA because it was an internal VA document. At the same time, Carney said Obama had long been aware of problems at the VA and sought to address them since taking office, adding ""this is not a new issue to the President."" In 2007, then-Sen. Obama of Illinois vowed to tackle the issue of insufficient care for veterans at a campaign event during his first run for the presidency. ""When a veteran is denied care, we are all dishonored,"" Obama said in the August 2007 speech, adding: ""It's not enough to lay a wreath on Memorial Day, or to pay tribute to our veterans in speeches."" So far, the President has resisted calls by Republicans to fire Shinseki. Numerous whistle blowers from other VA hospitals across the country have stepped forward to describe similar delays varying schemes by officials to hide the extended waits. Meanwhile, an audit team sent to the Malcom Randall VA Medical Center in Gainesville, Florida, discovered a list of patients needing follow-up appointments that was kept on paper instead of in the VA's electronic computer system. Florida problems . As a result, three members of the Gainesville VA's supervisory staff have been placed on paid leave, pending the outcome of the inspector general's investigation, VA Sunshine Healthcare Network spokeswoman Mary Kay Hollingsworth said Monday. The secret waiting list in Phoenix was part of an elaborate scheme designed by Veterans Affairs managers there who were trying to hide that 1,400 to 1,600 sick veterans were forced to wait months to see a doctor, according to a recently retired top VA doctor and several high-level sources who spoke exclusively to CNN. Phoenix VA officials denied any knowledge of a secret list, and said they never ordered any staff to hide waiting times. They acknowledged some veterans may have died waiting for care there, but they said they did not have knowledge about why those veterans might have died. CNN has sought numerous times to interview Shinseki, but the requests have been denied. Obama has not publicly addressed the controversy in nearly three weeks since first commenting on the matter during a trip to Asia. Carney said Monday that Obama was likely to address the matter ""soon,"" but on Tuesday, he said he had no details to announce about the President's plans. Rights group calls VA 'scapegoat' in scandal over wait times, care . VA response ""unacceptable"" Also Tuesday, House Veterans' Affairs Committee Chairman Jeff Miller complained of a ""very weak"" and ""unacceptable"" response by the Department of Veterans Affairs to a subpoena from his panel over the alleged health care delays. The Florida Republican told CNN that if the VA doesn't provide more details about the information sought earlier this month, the committee could move to hold the embattled agency in contempt. The top Democrat on the House panel, Rep. Michael Michaud of Maine, told reporters that both sides were frustrated with the response so far. ""We do not want to give them more time if they don't need that time -- if this is in fact is a delay,"" Michaud said. ""There has been a credibility problem within the VA and that's one of the reason why we're concerned."" The VA said in a statement that it had begun to turn over documents and would continue to do so on a rolling basis. Support for Shinseki holding for now among Senate Democrats .

"(CNN) -- A cold case in Alabama is heating up. State law enforcement officials announced the indictment of a suspect Wednesday in a series of sex crimes committed against three young Alabama girls between 1999 and 2004. Attorney General Luther Strange credited the state's unit that focuses on older, unsolved crimes for the arrest. ""This case is an example of the excellent work performed on a regular basis by the Cold Case Unit,"" Strange said in statement. A Calhoun County grand jury returned an indictment against former county resident Billy Wayne Cooper, 45, on May 6. Cooper is charged with a number of counts of rape, sodomy, and sexual abuse. The victims were between 13 and 15 years old at the time of the crimes, which occurred in multiple locations, according to a press release from the attorney general's office. ""Since beginning its work, the Cold Case Unit has provided hope and delivered justice for many victims whose cases had long gone unsolved,"" Strange said. The suspect is already serving time for convictions in other sexual attacks . Cooper is currently jailed at a detention facility in Fort Leavenworth, Kansas. He's serving a sentence for convictions in multiple sex crimes at U.S. Army posts in Washington state and Germany. The Alabama charges carry a maximum penalty of life in prison.

"(CNN) -- Three members of the ""Midnight Rider"" moviemaking team have been indicted in the death of a camera assistant. Randall Miller, Jody Savin and Jay Sedrish were charged Thursday with involuntary manslaughter and criminal trespass regarding the death of Sarah Elizabeth Jones, a camera assistant on the film. Jones was on the set of the Gregg Allman biopic when she was struck and killed by a freight train near Savannah, Georgia, on February 20. The indictment notes that Miller and Savin are the owners of Unclaimed Freight Productions Inc., the film's production company. Sedrish was the executive producer. Under Georgia law, involuntary manslaughter carries a potential sentence of 10 years. Criminal trespass, a misdemeanor charge, has a potential sentence of 12 months. Six other crew members were also injured in the accident, which occurred when Jones and others were filming on train tracks in Wayne County, Georgia. A CSX train, moving at about 58 mph, came through and struck Jones. After the incident, Jones became the subject of mourning in the film community. Friends set up a Facebook group, Slates for Sarah, and she was even noted in the Academy Awards' ""In Memoriam"" montage. Film crew member's tragic death prompts movement . Gregg Allman, ""Midnight Rider's"" subject, also shared his condolences.

"(CNN) -- It's not easy carrying the burden of a sports-mad nation's lofty expectations of world-beating dominance on your shoulders, especially on home soil, but Richie McCaw did it -- with a broken foot. Battered and bruised, and knowing that the All Blacks' other iconic star player, Dan Carter, had already been ruled out for the rest of the 2011 Rugby World Cup, McCaw soldiered on for three crucial matches -- four hours of on-field punishment . He hid the extent of his injury from fans, media, his coaches and teammates to keep alive his dream of being the first New Zealand captain to lift the Webb Ellis trophy for almost a quarter of a century. ""The team had been number one in the world, or close to it, for a lot of years during the disappointment of not winning it,"" McCaw told CNN's Human to Hero series. ""We had a team that was good enough, but it doesn't mean anything when you get to a tournament like that, if you don't put it on the field where it counts. ""There was heartache along the way, but the appreciation of what you've done ... I certainly appreciated it. The first emotions were sheer relief that we'd finally been able to knock it off. Had we not gone through that, maybe it wouldn't mean as much as it did."" When it comes to rugby, New Zealanders expect victory. Nothing else will do. Defeat is rare -- and as painful as the body blows that are routine for those who play one of the world's most physically demanding sports. The traditional Maori war dance that the All Blacks perform before every match -- known as ""the Haka"" -- is one of the most fearsome, and highly anticipated, sights on the international rugby stage. ""It is something very unique to New Zealand,"" McCaw said. ""It's who we are and were we come from ... a little island way down south, a long way from anywhere. It's a pretty powerful symbol of what the All Blacks and New Zealand is all about."" So it was a matter of great national hurt that the All Blacks had not been world champions since winning the inaugural tournament in 1987, also at home. ""Up until the (2011) World Cup, everyone acknowledged, ""Ah the All Blacks are great,' but there was always a 'but' -- I suppose because they hadn't won the World Cup. To not have that 'but' anymore was pretty satisfying,"" McCaw said. McCaw knows all about winning. Having become first All Black to achieve a century of Test appearances during the 2011 World Cup, this year he reached 100 victories from just 112 appearances -- a phenomenal strike rate. He suffered heartbreak in 2003, losing in the World Cup semifinals to arch-rivals Australia, and in 2007 the All Blacks crashed out ignominiously against France in the quarterfinals, leading McCaw to reconsider his future as captain. Instead of making wholesale changes, the New Zealanders regrouped and went into the 2011 tournament -- once again -- as hot favorites. McCaw reached his century of caps in the third pool game against France, but his foot problem ruled him out of the match against Canada -- and international rugby's record points scorer Carter, who was to replace him as captain, then suffered a tournament-ending injury in training. ""I didn't know what to say to Dan,"" McCaw recalls in his autobiography ""The Open Side."" ""Here's a guy, a decent humble man, acknowledged to be the best of his generation, perhaps of any generation, who's been crocked at the top of his game just when he's about to perform on the biggest stage. ""I've had the odd moment since Dan went down this afternoon where I thought, 'Jesus, it could be the two of us.' But sitting with Dan, I know that it can't be me now. Can't happen. No moaning about my foot. Unlike Dan, I've still got a chance of playing and somehow, any old how, that's what I've got to do."" McCaw returned for the quarterfinal against Argentina, in which teammate Mils Muliaina became the second All Black to win 100 caps but then went off with a fractured shoulder. The injury crisis was mounting, and McCaw had his own worries. ""If I have to jump or run or push or tackle, I can do it -- adrenaline's a great painkiller. But when play stops and I have to walk or jog to a lineout or scrum 20 meters away, I'm really struggling."" he says in his book. McCaw played the full 80 minutes in a 20-6 crushing of Australia, then held on to the bittersweet end in a nerve-wracking 8-7 win over France in the title decider -- a rematch of the 1987 final that he had watched as a boy. ""I was about age 6 and watching it on TV. The image that I have in my head is John Kirwan scoring one of the tries,"" he said. ""That sort of stuck with me I suppose. I thought it would be pretty cool to be like him."" While Kirwan was one of New Zealand's star backs, McCaw would go on to follow in the rugged boot prints of legendary forwards such Wayne Shelford, Michael Jones and Josh Kronfeld. He has been named world player of the year three times, drawing both respect and anger from opponents and critics for his uncanny ability to tread the fine line between smart thinking and illegal play -- as did one of his predecessors as skipper, 1987 World Cup winner Sean Fitzpatrick. Having finally landed New Zealand's holy grail, McCaw is hoping to play at the next World Cup in England in 2015, when he'll be 35. But after a long career as one of the most dynamic and influential forwards in rugby, it's time to take a break -- a six-month sabbatical in which he plans to get away from it all. He has plenty of incentive to come back stronger -- his last match was a shock defeat to England last month which ended the All Blacks' 20-match unbeaten run. ""I hope having the time off will make me play a bit longer. So I'm taking it before I desperately need it, with the hope I'll come back fresh mentally and physically,"" he said. ""I'm pretty keen to get away and have a look at places I've haven't been before and where rugby is not something people know too much about. That's part of what wears you down a little bit, when you are living in fishbowl like you do in New Zealand, and it's just nice to have a bit of time to be anonymous."" McCaw has hinted that he will head to the U.S. and indulge his other passion -- flying. His grandfather was a fighter pilot during World War Two, and he has continued the family interest, being named an honorary squadron leader in the New Zealand Air Force. He flies planes, helicopters and gliders, and has even narrated an aviation TV program. ""Dad flies, his brothers fly, a couple of my cousins fly, my aunty flies. We've got flying in common. When I go home to the old man we sit and talk way more about flying than rugby,"" McCaw says in ""The Open Side."" ""Gliding teaches you that you've got to be prepared as you possibly can for whatever contingencies of terrain and weather might eventuate when you're up there. At the same time, you have to acknowledge that no matter how much you prepare, no matter how thorough you are, you can't anticipate everything that Nature and Fate throw at you."" When he returns from his sabbatical in mid-2013, McCaw knows that the rugby world will be trying to knock him and the All Blacks off their pedestal. ""A lot of people ask me what's left to achieve or why do you still want to play. I guess you readjust the challenges,"" he told CNN. ""You have the tag of world champions for four years -- you try to live up to that every time. I know what it's like, I've tried to knock off the world champs the following year. ""If we have that sort of goal, that sort of attitude, hopefully we will keep that level where it needs to be.""","Richie McCaw is second New Zealander to lead All Blacks to Rugby World Cup title .

"(CNN)  -- There was a time that Pamela Hobbs believed justice had been served for her young son's murder. But 16 years after the mutilations and killings of three 8-year-old Cub Scouts, including her son, she has more doubts than ever. Tear-stricken and angry, Pamela Hobbs sat through the original trial of the three accused teens -- Damien Echols, 18; Jessie Misskelley Jr., 17, and Jason Baldwin, 16. They were convicted of murdering her son, Stevie Branch, and two other neighborhood boys, Michael Moore and Christopher Byers. The second-graders' bodies were found bruised and mutilated in a West Memphis, Arkansas, ditch; their arms and legs were bound by shoe laces. The killers became dubbed the West Memphis 3. When interviewed by media and documentary crews after the trial, Hobbs believed justice had been served. Misskelley and Baldwin had life sentences. Echols was on death row. But recent developments -- including new eyewitness statements and DNA evidence from the defense -- have uprooted her faith in those prosecutions. Once a staunch believer that the teens were guilty, now she says the teens accused of killing her son in the West Memphis 3 deserve a new trial. ""I wanted to believe in our justice system,"" said Hobbs, now 45. She moved to Blytheville, Arkansas, shortly after the 1993 trial. ""But time heals all wounds, and you start looking at things differently."" Her public change of heart has been supported by new evidence presented by the defense over the past few years. In 2007, DNA and forensic evidence tests revealed no physical evidence at the crime scene that linked the three teens to murders. The evidence was presented to the state. Furthermore, DNA that might belong to two other men was found in the knot used to tie Christopher. One of the men is Terry Hobbs, the stepfather of Stevie, the defense says. In 1993, such advanced DNA testing had not been available, attorneys said. The defense continues to argue the results of the DNA evidence. In September, the Arkansas Supreme Court received an appeal from Echols, requesting a new trial after the lower courts denied his request to submit new DNA evidence. This month, an Arkansas Law Review article stated Echols should be granted a new trial based on the 2007 DNA evidence. The Arkansas Supreme Court will likely hear oral arguments for a new trial for Echols in February, say officials representing him. Three eye witnesses, who resided next to one of the victims, filed affidavits in October with the Arkansas Supreme Court. The witnesses said they saw the second-graders with Terry Hobbs the night before the bodies were found by police. The statement from the witnesses contradicted Hobbs' statements to police and in court that he never saw his stepson, Stevie, on the day of the murder. ""They [authorities] never really did any investigation,"" said Dennis Riordan, Echols' defense attorney out of San Francisco, California. ""They never interviewed Hobbs. The fact that the witnesses saw him, and they realized for the first time, it was very significant."" Pamela Hobbs was divorced from Terry Hobbs in 2004 because of marital problems stemming from the pain that followed her son's death, she said. She declined to comment on whether she thought her ex-husband saw the 8-year-old boys. Hobbs has adamantly rejected the defense's allegations that he saw his stepson that day. Hobbs, 51, who still lives in West Memphis, said the defense is attempting to make him the target because Echols is on death row. There is no execution date set. He raises the question many skeptics of the three men's innocence have echoed: Why would the eyewitness evidence surface 16 years later? Why didn't the witnesses come forward sooner? To this day, Terry Hobbs says he believes the rightful killers are in prison. The State's Attorneys Office and prosecutors won't comment about the defense's claims. Mike Walden, prosecuting attorney for Craighead County, where the original trial took place, said the affidavits are weak. ""I think most people will tell you these affidavits are insufficient to justify filing charges against someone else,"" Walden said about the three new eyewitnesses presented by the defense. ""They don't contain enough evidence to enable a prosecuting attorney to make a charging position."" Critics of the defense attorneys say there has been too much finger-pointing over the past 16 years. The defense ""can't get their story straight,"" said Tracy Ripple, who started a Web site criticizing supporters of the West Memphis 3. West Memphis Police Department declined to comment. An officer said they were told by the state's Attorney General's office not to comment on the West Memphis 3 case. During the original trial in 1993, prosecutors argued the three teens were part of a satanic cult when they murdered the three children. They said punctures and cut marks on the victims were argued to be to be part of a sadistic ritual. After the trial, some forensic examiners argued those marks were animal bite marks. The prosecution relied on the confession of Misskelley, a 17-year-old with learning disabilities and an IQ of 70. He confessed after an untaped, three-hour interrogation by police without his parents or an attorney present. Misskelley later recanted his confession. The teens, now men serving time in the Arkansas penitentiary system, have maintained their innocence. They have tried appealing, arguing that they weren't adequately represented in the original trial. Echols remains on death row, and no execution date has been set. Pamela Hobbs hasn't been the only parent of the victims to shift to the side of the West Memphis 3 supporters. Mark Byers, the father of Christopher, lives in Millington, Tennessee. He said he began to think the three men might be innocent, particularly after the 2007 DNA tests results were released. His wife, Melissa, passed away in 1996. After the murders, Byers announced to the media fervently that he believed the West Memphis 3 were guilty. But by 2005, he began to question the original trial. He said parts of Misskelley's confession did not match up with actual crime. For example, the confession talks about committing the crime in the woods, but medical examiners found few traces of blood in the woods. ""The worst part about it is the three real victims that deserve justice, the three 8-year-old children have not been given justice,"" Byers said. ""They got a hack job for a police investigation. It was a rush to find someone who they said did this."" Todd and Diana Moore, parents of Michael, say the West Memphis 3 are guilty. Todd Moore, now divorced from Diana Moore, says he can't believe the eyewitness affidavits because they are based on memories from 16 years ago. His ex-wife declined to comment. ""They [witnesses] may have seen something,"" said Moore, who now lives in Marion, Arkansas. ""But May 5, 1993, wasn't the day."" The murders of the three boys remain etched into the community even years after the trial ended. The case inspired two HBO documentaries, ""Paradise Lost: The Child Murders at Robin Hood Hills"" and ""Paradise Lost 2."" As years passed, the West Memphis 3 continued to live in the media spotlight. The case gained notoriety among celebrities such as the Dixie Chicks and actress Winona Ryder, who have publicly said the three men should have a new trial. Over the years, the parents of the three boys have watched the headlines return. Some hope for a new trial for the three men, who have languished behind bars for their young adult years behind bars. And other parents pray the men will stay locked up for good. ""I want someone to put a stop to this,"" said Terry Hobbs. He fondly recalls the memories with his stepson -- the two of them swimming in the backyard pool. ""I'm tired of this stuff. No one understands or cares what this does to us as parents over and over again.""","New eyewitness statements emerge in West Memphis 3 case .

"(CNN) -- Mobile is a big deal in Africa. People probably get tired of hearing that, but there are around 820 million mobile subscriptions on the continent. Mobile payments are becoming the norm and tech startups are building to it. Established industries are being disrupted by mobile and services that have been otherwise lagging in the African market are finding new vigor due to mobile solutions and better and more efficient ways of doing business. So here are just a few of Africa's most interesting, exciting and emerging mobile startups. Clever cabs . In the consumer transportation sector, two startups have really shown some potential to really disrupt this industry. Both use the basics of Uber, a U.S.-based mobile personal driver, which has coincidentally entered the African market in the last couple of months. ZapaCab works with cab companies in South Africa. Its app allows to you to order a cab via your mobile device -- a driver is then dispatched to pick you up. You're given the driver's name, car details and the estimated time of arrival. Easy Taxi Taxi is a Brazilian startup backed by African Internet Holdings, and its app now has a Lagos version. Simply download the app, request a cab and wait for it. Read also: 10 African tech startups you need to know . Mellowcabs, on the other hand, is an amazing idea. Firstly its vehicles are very cool electrically assisted pedal-powered cabs -- and secondly, they are free to use, funded by advertising. The service wants to bring web advertising offline, sort of, through in-cab tablets. Each of the tablets runs geolocation software, so when the vehicles approach a certain store or restaurant, the software triggers specific adverts. In Ghana, the public sector is a good place to see what mobile can do. People who still use a post office box, this startup is for you. Based in Ghana, Boxbuzz is an SMS alert system that contacts PO box owners via text message whenever they receive mail in their boxes. How cool is that? No more unnecessary trips to the post office. Games and health . Gaming is becoming quite the thing in Africa and Nigerian startup ChopUp is looking to disrupt that with its social platform that connects mobile-device gamers across the continent. The platform allows players to interact based on gaming interests and achievements, and lets gamers share and transfer gaming points. Read this: Birth advice by text message, phone medicine in Kenya . As a wannabe health nut, I am always looking for apps that can help me be healthy and monitor my eating and exercise habits. Diet Assistant is a Uganda-based mobile startup that has created an app that recommends healthy and affordable meal choices made of locally available and accessible foods. The app also aims to help with weight control and it can be customized to fit your needs. The healthcare industry is getting a fair amount of disruption right now. Faselty is an online blood donation system that organizes and helps to facilitate blood donation processes. The mobile integrated platform works through location and blood type. Then there is the mobile messaging scene, which everyone wants to be in, with the hopes of competing with WhatsApp. In Africa, 2go seems to be the instant messaging startup most likely to succeed. The service claims to have more than 30 million registered users in total and just over 10 million of those are in Nigeria. E-commerce is really making the rounds in Africa. Every day a new shop pops up and with a rising middle class willing to spend all that disposable income, why not? That's the premise behind M-DUKA, a Ugandan mobile shopping platform that allows you to buy virtual services like airtime, and to pay utility bills. All transactions are done via mobile and receipts are issued via text message. Read also: Africa's giant infrastructure projects . Staying secure . Finally, mobile startups are also targeting the world of security. Cape Town, South Africa, is the birthplace of one of the world's most popular security startup success stories -- certificate authority Thawte, which today is owned by Symantec. A startup that some have theorized could be become the Symantec of the mobile age, IMPI (International Mobile Protection Initiative), also hails from Cape Town. IMPI provides anti-malware protection for Android devices, along with an integrated data management suite that simplifies the secure backup and storage of device data. Then there's Journey from Embark Mobile. Journey allows companies to build mobile applications to securely capture data for their internally facing processes. As the data collected from the apps are stored in Journey's cloud, communication is encrypted using industry-standard certificate-based SSL/TLS. The startup's focus on deploying secure applications has attracted businesses in the financial sector, which often have stringent requirements and policies regarding their own data. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Michelle Atagana.","Mobile phones are driving commerce in Africa, says Michelle Atagana .

"(CNN) -- This is a moment of terrible tragedy for Israelis and people of goodwill everywhere following the discovery of the bodies of three teenagers who were abducted and killed while hitchhiking in the West Bank. It is also a moment of high danger. When an entire nation -- and the entirety of the Jewish people -- is stunned and in deep mourning, it might be understandable that some among us would call for retribution. Understandable -- but not necessarily wise. What we need is justice and to avoid a downward spiral of violence, not retribution. In the Jewish world, we are all hurting right now, all angry. It is as if we have all suffered a death in our own family. Those of us who are parents are imagining how we would feel if the victims had been our children. The funerals of the three teens were unbearably sad. As Finance Minister Yair Lapid said at the funeral procession of Gilad Shaar, ""Let us remember that today we are burying a child. We are burying a child, who could have also been ours, and therefore he is also ours. We are not burying a settler or a soldier in the inevitable battle for this land."" Opinion: Teens' killing hurts Israelis, bad for Palestinians . At a time like this, it is more important than ever to remember our heritage and our values. ""Justice, justice, shall you pursue,"" declares the Book of Deuteronomy 16:20. Justice means finding those responsible and punishing them to the full extent of the law. It also means tracking down anyone who enabled them by planning this operation or by hiding the perpetrators or helping them escape. If they acted on orders from the highest levels of Hamas, as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said, they too should be held accountable. But justice also means not punishing those who were not responsible. Measures that simply make more miserable the lives of the 1.7 million people who live in Gaza and whose lives are already very tenuous should be avoided. The same applies for the 2.2 million people who live in the West Bank. Israel's government doubtless feels a need to provide a tough response, partly to re-establish a deterrence against such heinous acts, partly to satisfy the demands of its own grieving people. It should resist the temptation to act just for the sake of acting or from entering into a violent escalation with Hamas. Israel is justified in responding to rocket attacks from Gaza but should avoid any offensive that would put millions of civilians, both Israeli and Palestinian, in the firing line. The Israeli army's demolition of the family homes of two named suspects without any due process is an unwelcome return to a policy that Israel abandoned in 2005. As a deterrence, it has never succeeded in the past. It is simply a way of punishing people who happen to be related to suspected terrorists. Worst of all would be to react as Israel has responded so many times in the past by announcing a massive new expansion of settlements. Defense Minister Moshe Ya'alon has already suggested building a new settlement in memory of the teenagers. Not only would this lose Israel the world's sympathy, it would also weaken the Palestinian Authority and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, who has been a welcome voice for reason and moderation and whose security forces have maintained cooperation with the Israel Defense Forces throughout the crisis. Additionally, it would drive another stake into the heart of the two-state solution -- which remains the only sane and just way of resolving the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Until that conflict is ended through negotiations, tragically we will see more horrific acts of violence and more martyrs on both sides. We are seeing some of the consequences of the collapse of Secretary of State John Kerry's peace initiative in April. The absence of any movement toward peace has created a vacuum in which extremism can flourish. That's why it is so important for the United States not to walk away, but to remain engaged with both parties. This could be a decisive turning point for both Israelis and Palestinians. If Israel undertakes targeted measures designed to punish those responsible for this terrible crime, the world will be with it, and the crisis will be surmounted. If it turns its understandable anger into a general offensive, we could be in for a sustained period of violence claiming the lives of more innocent people on both sides. Lapid, the finance minister, expressed the right policy: ""We will find those responsible and we will punish them. The real revenge is our ability to bridge the gaps within us.""

"Baghdad, Iraq (CNN) -- Iraq's government touted its military offensive to recapture Saddam Hussein's hometown of Tikrit from extremists, with some officials taking to state-run television over the weekend to declare the army had defeated the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria. But those who live in the city nestled along the Tigris River, about 140 kilometers (about 87 miles) northwest of Baghdad, told a different story on Sunday. ""There are no Iraqi troops here,"" one woman told CNN by telephone from Tikrit. The only presence, at least in her neighborhood, is the ""Islamic state,"" she said, referring to ISIS. The extremist group on Sunday announced the establishment of a ""caliphate"" and the renaming of the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS) to the ""Islamic State"" in a newly released audio message and written statement purportedly from the official spokesman of ISIS, Abu Mohammed al-Adnani al-Shami. He said ""al-Baghdadi"" is the emir of the new caliphate, using his real name of Ibrahim Awwad Ibrahim Ali al-Badri al-Samarrai, but who is more commonly known as Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. The group's statement said its flag flies from Aleppo province in Syria to Diyala province in Iraq. It is also called on Muslims to swear allegiance to the caliphate, which means Islamic state. CNN could not independently verify the authenticity of the message. Witnesses: Heavy shelling in Tikrit . The woman in Tikrit, who asked not to be identified over concerns for her safety, said she could hear the sounds of a fierce battle, in the form of shelling, being carried out by both sides. A video posted on YouTube appears to support her assertion. In it, a man gives a tour of the city to show, he says, that there were no Iraqi security forces on the streets on Saturday -- the day Iraqi forces said they launched the offensive. On the video, the man can be heard repeatedly saying ""June 28, 2014,"" presumably to offer evidence of the date. The man says ""Thank God, Tikrit is safe and still in the hand of tribesmen and not troops of 'al-Haliki,'"" a derogatory reference to Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki that refers to his death. The video also shows a concrete blast wall erected around government buildings being taken down. Witnesses inside and outside of Tikrit said Iraqi forces were heavily shelling the city. Two days ago, the air force dropped leaflets from helicopters, demanding resident leave the city ""for their safety."" A large number of people have fled Tikrit for smaller villages to the north, according to witnesses, who say Iraqi forces are battling ISIS on the southern edge of the city. At the same time, state-run Iraqi TV showed video footage of large plumes of black smoke billowing from the city. Another video, released by the Ministry of Defense, showed Iraqi troops and convoys loaded with heavy weapons driving through the desert. The video was titled ""cleansing the road between Samarra and Tikrit."" CNN cannot independently confirm the claims. Possible turning of the tide for Iraq forces? Iraqi security forces were routed by ISIS fighters earlier this month during a lightning advance that saw the al Qaeda offshoot seize large swaths of northern and western Iraq. State-run Iraqiya TV reported that the Iraqi army and volunteer militia groups had cleared ISIS fighters from the city, having advanced on the city from four directions. Sheikh Khamis al-Joubouri, a key tribal leader in Tikrit, told CNN on Saturday that the Iraqi security forces entered the city supported by special forces and fighters from among the local tribes and had gained control. He said ISIS fighters retreated in the direction of Kirkuk and the province of Nineveh. But a combatant told a CNN freelance reporter that ISIS fighters remained in control of Tikrit, though there were fierce clashes in an area about 20 kilometers (12 miles) from the city center, toward Samarra. Two security officials in Samarra told CNN that Iraqi soldiers stopped the militants' advance about 10 kilometers (6 miles) south of Tikrit because ISIS had planted mines and booby-trapped houses. State-run TV aired footage Sunday of the arrival overnight of five Russian Sukhoi fighter jets. They are the first of 25 warplanes expected to be delivered under a contract agreed to by Moscow and Baghdad, the Ministry of Defense said in a statement provided to CNN. The announcement follows a comment by al-Maliki that militant advances might have been avoided if Iraq had proper air power, in the form of fighter jets that Iraq has been trying to get from the United States. ""I'll be frank and say that we were deluded when we signed the contract"" with the United States, al-Maliki told the BBC in the interview last week, which was released Friday. Iraq has now turned to Russia and Belarus to buy fighter jets, he said. ""God willing, within one week, this force will be effective and will destroy the terrorists' dens,"" he said. U.S. officials were quick to reject al-Maliki's complaints. U.S. fighter jets have not been slow in coming, Pentagon spokesman Rear Adm. John Kirby told CNN. The first two promised F-16s ""weren't expected to be delivered until the fall, which is still months away,"" Kirby said. ""And we were in the process of working towards that delivery."" The advance of the al Qaeda splinter group ""couldn't have been stemmed through the use of two particular fighter planes,"" he said. Al-Maliki's statements about the need for air support came as American and Arab diplomats told CNN that the United States is unlikely to undertake any military strikes against the militant group, the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria, and its allied fighters before a new government is formed in Iraq. State Department: Iraq helped create this problem . U.S. State Department spokeswoman Marie Harf told CNN that Iraq helped create the crisis. ""This kind of blame of others on the outside is quite frankly part of what's gotten Iraq into the situation it's in today. It's helped create the crisis. When we left Iraq, we gave the Iraqis the ability to create a better future,"" she said. ""And unfortunately, leaders across the spectrum didn't step up and take the opportunity. They blamed others and didn't bring the country together."" Al-Maliki and his Shiite-dominated government have been under pressure by the Western and Arab diplomats to be more inclusive of Iraq's Sunni minority, who say they have been marginalized and cut out of the political process by the government. Al-Joubouri said that the Sunni tribes in and around Tikrit were not aligned with the government or with ISIS and had stayed out of the fight until now. But, he said, when ISIS fighters who arrived in Tikrit robbed banks and carried out executions, as well as bringing the local economy to a standstill, the tribal leaders offered their help to the Iraqi security forces poised outside the city. The tribal leaders shared their knowledge of the city, including routes and known ISIS positions, he said. Also, Human Rights Watch has reported the discovery in Tikrit of two mass graves believed to contain the bodies of Iraqi soldiers, police and civilians killed by ISIS and its militant allies. In addition to the alleged executions in Tikrit, reports continue to emerge of atrocities committed by both sides. Human Rights Watch, citing displaced residents and local activists and journalists, said Saturday that ISIS fighters kidnapped at least 40 Shiite Turkmens, dynamited four Shiite places of worship and ransacked homes and farms in two villages just outside Mosul. The few Sunni villagers who remained in Guba and Shireekhan told those who fled that at least some of the kidnapped Turkmens had been killed, the rights group said. However, they had not seen bodies and could not give more information. ISIS destroyed seven Shiite places of worship in the predominantly Shia Turkmen city of Tal Afar, about 50 kilometers (31 miles) west of Mosul, earlier in the week, Human Rights Watch added, citing local sources. But the allegations of atrocities are not just limited to ISIS. Amnesty International has said it has gathered evidence pointing to a pattern of ""extrajudicial executions"" of Sunni detainees by government forces and Shiite militias in Tal Afar, Mosul and Baquba.

"(CNN) -- Leanna Harris, the mother of a Georgia toddler who died locked in a hot car, has told authorities that she researched such deaths and how they occur, according to a police affidavit. Her husband, Justin Ross Harris, the child's father, who is in jail without bond, has also told police that he used the Internet to research child deaths in vehicles and what temperature it needs to be for death to occur, police said. ""Justin stated that he was fearful that this could happen,"" the police affidavit said. In the document released Sunday, police say that during questioning Leanna Harris ""made similar statements regarding researching in car deaths and how it occurs."" The time frame for when this alleged research took place remains unclear. Their son, Cooper Harris, who was 22 months old when he died June 18, was buried after a funeral Saturday in Tuscaloosa, Alabama. Leanna Harris emphatically told a crowd at her son's funeral she loves and stands by her husband, even though he is charged with murder in the child's death. ""Am I angry with Ross?"" Leanna Harris said Saturday. ""Absolutely not. It has never crossed my mind. Ross is and was and will be, if we have more children, a wonderful father. Ross is a wonderful daddy and leader for our household. Cooper meant the world to him."" Police said Justin Ross Harris told them he forgot to drop his 22-month-old son at the day care center before going to work. The boy died after spending seven hours in a child safety seat in the back of an SUV. Harris was arrested hours after his son's death and has pleaded not guilty to charges of murder and second-degree child cruelty. The affidavit was filed in the application for a search warrant used to seize computers from the Harris home. 5 questions about toddler's hot-car death . A timeline of events . On the day Cooper died, his father stopped for breakfast at a fast-food restaurant and afterward strapped his son into a rear-facing child restraint seat on his SUV's back seat, police said. He drove to his workplace, a Home Depot corporate office, about a half-mile away. He works as a Web designer there. Usually, he would take his son to an on-site day care. But that day, police said, Harris left him in the car seat. During his lunch break, he returned to his car, opening the driver's side door to put something inside, police said. After work, around 4:16 p.m., the 33-year-old father got in his car and drove away. A few miles away, he stopped the car at a shopping center and called for help. When it became clear Cooper was dead, Harris was so inconsolable police had to restrain him. ""What have I done?"" he wailed as he tried to resuscitate the boy. The Cobb County medical examiner's office found the child's cause of death ""consistent with hyperthermia and the investigative information suggests the manner of death is homicide,"" according to a Cobb County Department of Public Safety statement issued last week. Temperatures hit 92 degrees Fahrenheit on the day of Cooper's death. The medical examiner's office is waiting for toxicology test results before making an official ruling as to the cause and manner of the toddler's death.

"Rio de Janeiro, Brazil (CNN) -- Cement-block walls are being built around the shantytowns of Rio de Janeiro. Authorities say it's to save rainforests. The city's poorest residents say it's an attempt to shut them out. When Francisco de Moraes looks at the wall, it angers him. He has one of the best views of Rio, overlooking the city, its shimmering beaches and Sugarloaf Mountain jutting from the sea. ""We don't have the right to have our opinion heard,"" he said. He speaks during a break from a soccer game on a makeshift cement field that's wedged in by the wall. The ""eco-wall,"" as officials call it, runs up next to his house and around most of the Santa Marta shantytown where he and about 7,000 others live. ""The state government walled us in, so more houses wouldn't be built in the forest,"" de Moraes said. ""But people felt imprisoned, like they were setting borders and limiting when we could come and go."" The state of Rio de Janeiro began building the wall around Santa Marta in March, and it plans to spend $17 million on similar walls around the shantytowns. There are nearly 1,000 such favelas -- cramped poor communities built around the city. The squalid homes tilt from their shaky foundations, some built on top of others. Many are carved into the humid rainforest that cling to the hillsides. It's estimated about 20 percent of Rio's 6 million people live in the shantytowns. Icaro Moreno, director of Rio state's public works, says the walls are necessary because the favelas have continued to expand by 7 percent over the last decade, making them one of the biggest causes of deforestation in the state. ""The limits used to be virtual and now they're physical,"" he told reporters at a news conference. ""The government is saying, 'If you cross them or break them, you will be violating public property.' "" Some residents feel officials are keen to rein in the expansion of Rio's chaotic slums ahead of the 2016 Olympics. The naked cement and brick homes of the shantytowns can be spotted from beaches. Locals feel the city's elite are trying to wall off an eyesore. Blog: Postcard from Rio's 'pacified' slum . ""They treat the people here like children who need to be corralled in,"" said Eliane Lopes, who runs her own party-organizing business in Santa Marta. ""We can respect limits as well as the rich people. We don't need a wall."" Founded by squatters looking for work in the big city, shantytowns like Santa Marta are not even on most maps. Critics see the wall as a barrier between crime-ridden slums and beachside condos rather than an effort to protect the forest. But not everyone in Santa Marta opposes the wall. Jiuzel has lived here for 34 years and he's seen the population explode in size, more than double what it was in the 1970s. He says an increased police presence and investments in projects like the wall and a funicular (cable car on rails) linking the steep slum to the rest of the city shows that officials are trying to improve their standard of living. ""People are pleased because it's going to protect the Atlantic Forest. Protecting the environment is important,"" he said from his balcony overlooking the forest. The Atlantic Forest blanketed much of Brazil's coast when Portuguese adventurers landed here 500 years ago. According to experts, the humid rainforest was home to more plant and animal species than the Amazon. Only 7 percent of the original forest is left. In Rio, the plan is to build about 9 miles (14 km) of walls around 13 favelas in danger of eroding the jungle further. Critics have drawn parallels to the Berlin Wall or the barriers that separate Israel from Palestinian territory. Fernando Gabeira, a senator from Brazil's Green Party, disagrees. ""This wall is not a wall like the Berlin wall,"" he says. ""Everyone may pass. There is no control trying to avoid people visiting the community or leaving the community."" But, he says, he recommended introducing a satellite tracking system to prevent the expansion of favelas, instead of building a physical barrier. ""It's the difference between soft power and hard power.""","Rio de Janeiro is erecting walls around shantytowns to protect rainforests .

"(CNN) -- Fierce fighting in eastern Ukraine has forced authorities to suspend the search for victims who died when Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 was shot out of the sky. ""The Dutch mission at the crash site of MH17 has stopped,"" Prime Minister Mark Rutte told reporters Wednesday. Search teams plan to return to the plane crash site, Rutte said. But he didn't give a date of when that might happen. ""We have done what we could do in the current conditions,"" Rutte said. ""Everyone will agree with us that we should not expose our people to unnecessary risk."" Putin issues retaliatory ban on food imports . Constant shelling was heard north of Donetsk on Wednesday evening. And small-arms fire came very close to the investigation team at the crash site Wednesday, forcing them to withdraw from the site, said Pieter-Jaap Aalbersberg, head of the recovery mission. Searchers are disappointed they haven't been able to complete their mission, he said. But he said they did make significant headway, recovering human remains and personal belongings like photo albums, diaries and toys. ""We aim to return to the crash site as soon as we have the opportunity to work there for a longer period under stable conditions,"" he said. Uptick in Donetsk violence . Ukrainian forces continued their attempt to take back control of the restive city of Donetsk from pro-Russian separatists Wednesday. Russia's Foreign Ministry claimed in a statement Monday that the Ukrainian military was firing missiles and using multiple rocket systems in and around the city. It accused Ukraine's government of wanting to continue the war and called for talks to find a political solution to the crisis. With escalated fighting and Ukrainian forces making gains, the Russian deployment at the border could portend an intervention under the banner of a peacekeeping operation. Russia asked the U.N. Security Council on Tuesday for an emergency hearing on the humanitarian crisis in Ukraine . Russian troop buildup . The buildup of Russian troops along the Ukraine border is raising concerns that Moscow might be contemplating another intervention similar to the one that annexed Crimea earlier this year. According to a NATO official, Russia now has about 20,000 troops stationed ""in an area along the entire border with eastern Ukraine."" The buildup nearly doubled the troop deployment in the past week by adding 8,000 more forces to 12,000 already there, the official said. In addition, Russia's Defense Ministry is staging a week of military exercises involving air troops and anti-missile defense forces. The exercises are taking place in Russia's southern Astrakhan region, roughly 500 miles from the border with Ukraine. Similar military exercises preceded Russia's annexation of Crimea in March, which escalated the Ukraine conflict after the ouster of pro-Moscow President Viktor Yanukovych a month earlier. Refugees flee conflict . The ongoing fighting has killed close to 1,400 people -- civilians and combatants -- and more than 4,000 people have been wounded in eastern Ukraine since mid-April, according to U.N. officials. The fighting has also forced hundreds of thousands of people to flee their homes and seek shelter either elsewhere in Ukraine or across the border in Russia. The U.N. refugee agency, the UNHCR, said Tuesday that the Russian authorities estimate that around 730,000 Ukrainians have sought sanctuary in Russia this year under a visa-free travel program. This includes more than 168,000 who have reported to Russia's Federal Migration Service. UNHCR's European director, Vincent Cochetel, told journalists in Geneva that about 80% of the Ukrainians who have fled to Russia are staying in border areas, while others are with friends or family in other parts of the country. Many people in eastern Ukraine are Russian-speaking and have strong ties to Russia. At the same time, nearly 118,000 people are reported to be internally displaced, most of them from eastern Ukraine, based on information given to the UNHCR by Ukrainian authorities and local NGOs. ""In the past seven days more than 6,200 people have been forced from their homes,"" Cochetel said. Many have fled with limited possessions, some driven out by the destruction of homes and infrastructure, while others say they fear being caught in the crossfire or suffering persecution. John Ging, operations director of the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, called on all sides Tuesday to allow people to move freely and safely. ""The humanitarian situation is deteriorating, and the worrying increase in violence in urban areas puts a greater number of people at risk. ""Until violence is ended, we will continue to see an increase in human suffering, and in the number of people displaced. Immediate action is required to prevent this crisis from worsening,"" he said, according to prepared remarks. Who are Ukraine's pro-Russia rebels?

"(CNN) -- The conservation group World Wildlife Fund ousted Spain's King Juan Carlos as its honorary president after his Botswana hunting trip sparked an outcry for its extravagance during an economic crisis. The king's private visit came to light this year when he was rushed back to Madrid to undergo hip surgery after falling during the trip. A firestorm ensued, forcing the 74-year-old king to apologize in April. ""I am very sorry. I made a mistake and it won't happen again,"" the king said on Spanish state television as he left the hospital. Spain's king apologizes for African hunting trip . The Spanish chapter of the WWF voted Saturday to abolish the honorary post, which the king has held since 1968. ""Although not illegal, the hunting was widely viewed as incompatible with the King's position at the head of WWF-Spain,"" the group said in a statement. There was no immediate response from the royal palace. Spaniards hold the king in high regard for his service to the nation and his defense of democracy after the death of dictator Francisco Franco in 1975. The criticism of the trip initially focused on the expensive safari amid the nation's 23% unemployment rate and austerity measures to make up for budget shortfalls. Some critics also wondered how much public money was spent for security during the king's private trip. As the economic crisis was unraveling, the king expressed concern over the impact on Spaniards and urged them to come together to get through the tough times. The royal household has a budget of 8.26 million euros ($10.8 million) this year -- 2% less than last year -- and has announced cuts in salaries of some of its staffers. The safari was the latest in a series of scandals for the royal family this year. In April, the king's 13-year-old grandson shot himself in the foot with a shotgun during target practice with his father. The legal age in Spain to handle firearms, even when accompanied by an adult, is 14. And the king's son-in-law, Inaki Urdangarin is a suspect in a financial fraud scandal in which public funds earmarked for his foundation allegedly were diverted for private use. He denies the charges. CNN's Al Goodman contributed to this report .","King Juan Carlos' hunting trip sparks an outcry over its extravagance .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Raw video of Michael Jackson's last days is not covered by laws protecting journalists from court subpoenas, making it likely that Sony will have to let lawyers use its video in their defense of Dr. Conrad Murray, a judge said Thursday. Lawyers for Murray, who faces trial for involuntary manslaughter in the pop star's death, argued that the unseen rehearsal video could show that Jackson was ill and physically weak. Prosecutors contend that Jackson died from an overdose of a surgical anesthetic that Murray gave him to induce sleep. Sony Pictures, which bought the video from Jackson's estate, is fighting the subpoena from Murray's lawyers for access to about 100 hours of video that was used to produce the ""This Is It"" documentary, released several months after the singer's June 25, 2009, death. The judge has given the prosecution permission to show clips from the movie to jurors during the trial, which is scheduled to start in September, but the defense wants to use video left on the cutting room floor. Since Sony was under a contractual obligation with the estate to not use anything that showed Jackson in ""a negative light,"" the unused video may be helpful to the defense, Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Michael Pastor said. The judge gave Sony a week to work out technical details with the defense for a way they can view the raw video without the risk of it leaking. Sony's lawyer said the public release of the raw video could hurt the studio's plans to use it in other productions, such as an anniversary edition of the documentary. ""If they become part of the public record as an exhibit, we have a whole different problem,"" Sony attorney Gary Bostwick said. ""That would immediately become viral on TMZ or some other website."" Defense lawyers were ordered to narrow their subpoena request for the video, which Pastor called ""remarkably over-broad."" Michael Jackson hired video photographers to record his rehearsals as he prepared for his comeback concerts in London, scheduled for July 2009. His estate later sold the video and documentary rights to Sony for about $80 million. Jackson was pronounced dead by an emergency room doctor at Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center. The Los Angeles County coroner ruled that his death was caused by an overdose of propofol, a powerful surgical anesthetic, in combination with ""the contributory affects of the benzodiazepines."" Murray, who was hired as Jackson's personal doctor in the months leading up to the concert, was later charged with involuntary manslaughter in his death. ""Michael is not with us today because of an utterly inept, incompetent, reckless doctor, the defendant Conrad Murray,"" Los Angeles County Deputy District Attorney David Walgren said in his final arguments at Murray's preliminary hearing in January. Murray's lawyers suggested that a frustrated and sleepless Jackson may have self-ingested the fatal dose while the doctor was out of his bedroom. The defense is hoping the raw video will show Jackson's weakness and frustration as the concert dates neared.","Dr. Conrad Murray's lawyers want Sony to hand over all raw video of Jackson's rehearsals .

"(CNN) -- In January, I brought my 4-year-old daughter to Robinson's Arch, the section of Jerusalem's Western Wall reserved for egalitarian prayer without gender segregation. My husband and I, both Conservative rabbis, explained to her that this sacred space once formed part of the ancient Temple compound, and we helped her to place a folded-up prayer note in the cracks between the stones. It was a sweet moment and one made possible by lengthy negotiations between the Israeli government and the Reform and Conservative denominations of Judaism, as well as the women's prayer group known as Women of the Wall. While the Orthodox authorities who govern the main plaza of the Wall mandate gender segregation, the agreement to create an enhanced prayer space at Robinson's Arch allows Jews of all denominations to pray at the Western Wall without compromising our egalitarian beliefs. But at the end of February, the Jerusalem District Court approved an agreement between two government subsidiaries to transfer management of Robinson's Arch to an organization of religious right-wing settlers, Elad, posing a new threat to the ability of liberal Jews to pray at this site without checking our values at the door. Today, the Jerusalem district court will hear a complaint by the Israeli Attorney General's Office that the Housing Ministry organized the transfer without authorization. North American Jews must join in this opposition. Elad exists in order to move Jewish settlers into Palestinian neighborhoods of East Jerusalem, so as to establish facts on the ground that will obstruct any peace agreement. For this, Elad raises $6 million a year from American Jews. This money funds legal maneuvers to evict Palestinian families from their homes and the establishment of Jewish settlement compound in Palestinian neighborhoods of East Jerusalem. Elad also manages the City of David archaeological site in East Jerusalem. Leading Israeli archaeologists have complained about the use of this site for ideological propaganda tourism. There is little question that if Elad takes over the archaeological park connected to Robinson's Arch, per the current agreement, our prayer space will similarly be used as a settler propaganda mill. I recently visited Silwan, the neighborhood that has suffered the most from Elad's activities. New fortresses, with Israeli flags flapping over barbed wire barriers, now tower over the humble homes of longtime Arab residents. Armed guards accompany the settlers wherever they go. Those who argue that Jews must be permitted to move into any area of Jerusalem must understand: This is not a question of diversifying the neighborhood. It's a hostile takeover. It is aimed at ensuring that East Jerusalem will never become part of a Palestinian state and, in fact, that no such state will ever come to be. The Reform and Conservative movements, as well as Women of the Wall, responded swiftly and furiously to the announcement that Elad may take control of Robinson's Arch. In a strongly worded joint statement, they argued that an Orthodox organization cannot be trusted to maintain the area as a place for egalitarian prayer. This anger is justified. The very suggestion that an Orthodox group would manage the prayer space reserved for non-Orthodox prayer reveals how tone-deaf some sectors of the Israeli government have become to the voices of North American Jews, the vast majority of whom believe that men and women should be equal in prayer as in other parts of life. But the danger of transferring power to Elad goes far beyond the question of who may pray where. This organization seems to have little stake in the debate over egalitarian prayer and in fact has announced its intent to respect existing agreements. More concerning is the possibility that those of us committed to egalitarian prayer at the Western Wall will end up supporting the expansion of settlements and the erosion of the peace process through our donations and entrance fees. The endless negotiations over religious pluralism in Israel have exposed the fissure between North American Jews, who are Israel's greatest financial and political supporters, and the Israeli religious establishment. On issues such as the right of women to lead services at the Wall, Reform, Conservative, Reconstructionist and even Orthodox American Jews have been willing to issue strong statements and even protest at the Israeli Embassy. The current crisis over ceding control of an egalitarian prayer space to an organization of right-wing settlers has blown apart the delusion that North American Jewish leaders can criticize Israel on issues of religious pluralism while staying away from criticisms of settlement policy. The two are too deeply intertwined. Rejecting the Orthodox hegemony that has placed the main plaza of the Wall off-limits to egalitarian prayer services also means loosening the grip of settlers on Israeli politics.","Prayer space at Western Wall may become politicized, Rabbi Jill Jacobs writes .
She says a portion open to both men and women is being ceded to a settler group .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Michael Jackson's last words were a plea for more propofol, ""because that was the only thing"" that would put him to sleep, Dr. Conrad Murray said in an interview aired on NBC's ""Today"" show Thursday. Days after Murray declined to testify in his own defense at his involuntary manslaughter trial, he granted an interview with NBC, the same broadcast company that bought a documentary about Murray and Jackson. NBC has not revealed any financial terms of its deal to secure the exclusive interview with Jackson's doctor, which it said was recorded in the ""waning days of the case,"" despite a judge's order to Murray that he not speak to reporters. Murray told NBC that he had no regrets about meeting Jackson two years before his death. ""I only wish that maybe in our dealings with each other he was more forthcoming and honest to tell me things about himself,"" he said. Jackson, who hired Murray to be his personal physician as he prepared for his comeback tour, lied to him, Murray said. ""Well, certainly he was deceptive by not sharing with me his whole medical history, doctors he was seeing, treatment that he might have been receiving,"" he said. He denied knowing that Jackson had an addiction problem, which his defense lawyers said contributed to the pop star's death. ""Absolutely not,"" he said. ""I did not have a clue."" The Los Angeles County coroner ruled that Jackson's June 25, 2009, death was caused by an overdose of the surgical anesthetic propofol combined with two sedatives. A jury concluded that Murray was criminally responsible for the death, which prosecutors argued was caused by the doctor's reckless use of propofol in his home to treat the singer's insomnia. In hindsight, Murray said, he knows that he should have refused the job when he realized Jackson was demanding propofol infusions every night. ""But if I had walked away, I would have abandoned a friend,"" he said. He repeated what he told detectives two days after Jackson's death: He was trying to wean him off propofol in his final days. ""Three days towards his death, he was weaned off and I was extremely happy because I had finally achieved the state I wanted,"" Murray said. ""The state was Michael away from propofol."" His last morning, he said, Jackson was ""a desperate man, desperate."" The NBC interview asked about the last thing Murray heard Jackson say. ""It was probably when he was pleading and begging me to please, please let him have some 'milk,' because that was the only thing that would work,"" he said. Jackson's nickname for propofol was ""milk,"" according to trial testimony. Murray explained a mystery that arose during his trial: the audio recording of Jackson using slurred speech that investigators found on the doctor's iPhone. ""It was incidentally recorded,"" Murray said. ""It was an accident."" He insisted he did not realize the recording existed until he heard it in the prosecutor's opening presentation at the trial. Jackson was under the influence of propofol at the time, he said. More segments of the NBC interview will be broadcast Friday morning, including Murray's explanation for why he delayed calling 911 and why he did not tell paramedics and emergency room doctors that he had given Jackson propofol the day he died, the network said.","""He was deceptive by not sharing with me his whole medical history,"" the doctor says .

"(CNN) -- Eliot Spitzer has every reason in the world not to want to talk about it. But talk he does in the new documentary, ""Client No. 9: The Rise and Fall of Eliot Spitzer"" opening Friday in limited release. The film is directed by Alex Gibney, whose work has included acclaimed documentaries ""Enron: The Smartest Guys in the Room"" and ""Taxi to the Dark Side."" ""Client 9"" traces the prostitution scandal that ended Spitzer's term as governor of New York in 2008. Gibney interviews several of the people who became adversaries of Spitzer in the wake of his attempts to reform both Wall Street and Albany as well as one of the women Spitzer allegedly saw on multiple occasions. Spitzer recently spoke with CNN about why he participated in the film, his thoughts on the theory that there was a conspiracy to topple him from power and what he has learned in the wake of the scandal. CNN: Let's start with the obvious question of why did you agree to participate in the documentary? Spitzer: I thought it would help with getting the facts out and I thought that [Gibney] was interested in doing a straightforward recitation of facts and I thought that I could lend insight. CNN: Did you have any hesitation at all about dredging the whole thing up again? Spitzer: If you begin with the premise that he was making the movie, it just seemed to me to make more sense to participate and present the facts as I saw them. CNN: What did you think of the film? Spitzer: I'm neither a film critic nor in this case the best person to pass judgment, but I thought it was a fair story. CNN: I'm sure you would rather move on in your life, but what is it like to watch this situation play out again on the big screen and know that filmgoers will do the same? Spitzer: Look, you go on with your life and you learn to do what you are interested in and focus on what you are doing. You realize that other things will be going on but they are not the things I am focusing on. CNN: The film, or at least the trailer, makes it appear that there was this whole conspiracy [by Wall Street titans] to bring you down. What are your thoughts about that? Spitzer: What I've said throughout this is that I resigned because I thought it was the appropriate step to take in the context of what I had done, whether there were other things going on or what others were focused on. CNN: How were you approached about being in the film? Spitzer: Honestly, I can't remember. I presume I got an e-mail or a phone call. I'm sure Alex knows somebody I know and someone said, ""Hey they are doing a documentary on your life and isn't that a nice thing to hear?"" One way or another I ended up on the phone with Alex and we chatted. I think there were several conversations that finally resulted in agreeing to sit down with him. He's someone whose resume speaks for itself. He's someone who makes serious movies and doesn't dabble in the world of the scurrilous and shadows. He makes serious movies and he's won some serious awards. CNN: Did you have any rules going in about things you wouldn't discuss? Spitzer: I don't recall that there were any ground rules. CNN: How does it feel to be ""infamous""? Spitzer: Oh, I don't know. I think I'm many different things to many different people. CNN: Why did you want to be a part of your CNN show ""Parker Spitzer?"" Spitzer: It is great fun. It's informative. It is an effort to bring a smart debate and conversation to the air every night at 8 o'clock rather than a linear, sort of ideologically driven presentation that other networks have and I say that with a great deal of respect for what they put on the air and admiration for how they do it. But this is an effort to give the viewer both sides of the debate. CNN: Now that the scandal is over, you've moved on and you have a new show, what do you feel like you have learned? Spitzer: Life is peaks and valleys. I think we all are aware of that and it's better to be at a peak, but often you learn more in the valley. You go forward trying to do what you care about and taking care of the people you care about. It's not very complicated. CNN: You say it's not very complicated, but from the outside looking in it seems a bit complicated. Spitzer: The principles are easily stated. It's more complicated to live them in life, but to state the principles isn't that complicated. CNN: What do you hope people take away from this film? Spitzer: Certainly I hope they appreciate that when I was in government we did what mattered for the public on views that seemed important then, but I think have become even more important, and the sense that we fought awfully hard for the public both as attorney general and governor and focused on what was important. I saw the rough cut and what they showed at the film festivals. I don't know how much it differs from the final version, but I think some of that certainly came through in the movie and I hope [viewers] do take that away with them.","Eliot Spitzer agreed to participate in ""Client No. 9: The Rise and Fall of Eliot Spitzer""

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Conrad Murray wants a key piece of evidence tested which his lawyers argue could prove Michael Jackson injected himself with the drug that killed him. Murray, who is serving a four-year prison sentence, is appealing last year's involuntary manslaughter conviction in Jackson's 2009 death. A motion filed Monday by his lawyers asked an appeals court to order a test of the residue in a 100 milliliter bottle of propofol that prosecutors say contained the fatal dose of surgical anesthetic. Conrad Murray invites Katherine Jackson to visit him in jail . If it contains 10% lidocaine, then it would support prosecution expert Dr. Steven Shafer's theory that Murray rigged up an IV drip using the bottle and then left the room, Murray's motion said. Shafer testified that lidocaine, which was found in Jackson's blood after his death, was mixed with propofol to ease the sting of the drug as it entered a vein in Jackson's leg. ""However, if the residue is 100% propofol, it would absolutely refute Shafer's final contention that was used to prove an IV propofol infusion,"" the motion said. The defense theory was that a desperate Jackson, fearing that his comeback concerts could be canceled unless he found elusive sleep, self-administered propofol that Murray was trying to wean him off of. It contends that Jackson also swallowed eight lorazepam tablets while Murray was not watching. Two requests by Murray's lawyers to have the bottle tested after the trial were rejected by the trial judge, who ruled they should have asked for testing before the trial. Murray's lawyers argued the residue in the bottle, which the prosecution never tested, became relevant only at the end of the prosecution's case"" when Shafer ""remodeled"" his theory about how Jackson died. ""Dr. Shafer made a striking change in his rebuttal testimony, which occurred during the final minutes of the evidentiary portion of the trial,"" Murray lawyer Valerie Wass said. Murray told police he stopped using IV infusions of propofol to help Jackson sleep three days before his death, and that he only injected a small dose the morning he died. ""The amount of propofol Murray claims he gave Jackson does in fact comport with the amount of propofol found in Jackson's blood at autopsy,"" Murray lawyer J. Michael Flanagan said. ""There was no propofol infusion on the morning of Jackson's death. The analysis of the residue in Exhibit 30 will prove the truth once and for all."" The motion asks the appeals court to order the Los Angeles County Coroner to either test the residue or hand it over to a private lab for testing. Jackson family drama an unwanted reality show .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Michael Jackson's brothers are working on a reunion tour to perform their old Jackson 5 songs, Jermaine Jackson said Monday. ""Michael would want us to continue on,"" Jackson said, after he unveiled an exhibit of his brother's wax statues at Madame Tussauds in Hollywood. Saturday marks the second anniversary of the pop icon's sudden death, which the coroner ruled was from an overdose of a surgical anesthetic. ""The brothers now are ready just to keep the legacy going and the music,"" Jackson said. ""We're meeting today about putting a tour together just to play the music because it's such wonderful music. We need to continue to play this music because it's healing for us."" Jackson did not say which of his brothers were involved in the talks. Recent attempts to reunite the brothers on stage were met with frustration and division, including the effort documented by an A&E Network reality show in 2009. Monday's unveiling was a reunion of sorts for Michael Jackson. It featured wax figures depicting him as a child performing with the Jackson 5, as the ""Smooth Criminal"" from around 1987 and the ""This Is It"" Michael Jackson of his last year. Jermaine Jackson said his favorite was the last statue because of how it captured his brother's onstage posture. ""Someone was really paying a lot of attention to detail,"" he said.

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- AEG is not backing down from its charge that Michael Jackson's mother and her lawyers leaked e-mails to a reporter, in violation of a court order, despite a claim of responsibility by someone not connected to the Jackson's wrongful-death lawsuit against the concert promoter. The dramatic e-mails, published in the Los Angeles Times on Sunday, revealed the promoter for Jackson's ""This Is It"" concerts expressed doubts about the star's health and his ability to be ready for the shows for several months before his death. Howard Mann, who partnered with Katherine Jackson on a book about her family, acknowledged to CNN Wednesday that he gave the controversial documents to Times reporter Harriet Ryan. Mann said he obtained the documents from various sources, but none of them came from the Jacksons or their lawyers. Some of the documents were part of discovery in other cases, including the criminal trial of Dr. Conrad Murray, he said. ""The Times does not comment on sources,"" Ryan said in response to CNN's request for comment on Mann's claim that he gave them to her. Mann was involved in a bitter copyright dispute concerning that book with Jackson's estate at the time he gave the reporter the documents, but the lawsuit was settled earlier this week. E-mails show promoter's doubts before Jackson's death . AEG lawyer Marvin Putnam, who said Tuesday that he had ""unequivocal evidence"" showing that MIchael Jackson's mother and her lawyers leaked the e-mails, has asked the judge in the wrongful-death suit to punish Jackson with fines and exclude the e-mails as evidence in the case. ""The documents released to the press were given to Mrs. Jackson and her attorneys -- and to no one else -- confidentially in discovery and subject to a court order,"" Putnam said Tuesday. On Thursday, he called it ""convenient that Howard Mann -- a longtime business partner of the Jackson family -- has come forward in this fashion."" ""Whether these documents were leaked through an intermediary or directly by Mrs. Jackson and her counsel, this remains an egregious violation of the court's order requiring immediate sanctions and an investigation,"" the AEG lawyer said. Putnam accused Jackson and her lawyers of leaking the documents -- despite that their ""publication hurts her son's memory and her grandchildren more than anyone else"" -- because they ""know they cannot win on the law and are losing control over the case."" ""After months of discovery, plaintiffs now know what we have known all along -- there is nothing to support their claims,"" the AEG lawyer said. Jackson lawyer Kevin Boyle said the admission by Mann that he was the source of the e-mails should settle the matter. ""He (Mann) definitely never received any documents from Katherine, Prince, Paris, or Blanket Jackson, nor from their lawyers in the wrongful death suit against AEG,"" said Jackson lawyer Kevin Boyle. Prince, Paris and Blanket Jackson are Michael Jackson's children. Boyle criticized AEG's lawyers for their haste in pointing the finger at the Jacksons. ""AEG made these accusations against the Jackson family and their lawyers apparently without doing even the most rudimentary investigation,"" Boyle said. ""We are further disturbed that the motion for sanctions filed by AEG was given to the press before it was served on Katherine Jackson or her counsel."" If the AEG lawyers had reached out to the Jackson lawyers earlier, they could have helped solve the mystery of the leaked documents, he said. ""AEG has known about the alleged leak since a week before the article was published,"" Boyle said. ""AEG never contacted the Jackson's counsel to inquire about the article or the documents."" The documents made public in the Times story are not the most damaging to AEG that were uncovered, Boyle said. ""We can assure you that we are in possession of documents that make for an extremely compelling story in the wrongful-death case, and that completely support the plaintiffs' claims,"" he said. Jackson copyright dispute settled . CNN has learned from a lawyer for an insurance company embroiled in a lawsuit with AEG that Mann approached him several weeks ago offering the same documents to help their case against the promoter. The company declined to follow up since they did not know their authenticity, attorney Paul Schrieffer said. Mann alerted the lawyer Saturday that the e-mails would be published in the newspaper Sunday, Schrieffer said. ""The first time we saw these documents was in the Los Angeles Times article."" The existence of the e-mails, which were not turned over to the insurance company during the discovery phase of the case, have complicated AEG's effort to prevent a court from voiding the $17.5 million policy that AEG purchased through Lloyds of London, he said. ""We are looking for information about Michael Jackson's prior drug use and the failure of AEG to disclose the facts and what the truth was prior to our client's issuance of the policy,"" Schrieffer said. The AEG lawyer said the insurance company can expect to get the e-mails eventually. ""It appears the lawyers for the insurance company did what any ethical lawyer would do: they refused to receive documents leaked in violation of the Court's order. And I have every reason to believe the insurers will now receive those same documents as discovery continues,"" Putnam said. Jackson died on June 25, 2009, from what the Los Angeles County coroner ruled was an overdose of a surgical anesthetic and sedatives, drugs that Dr. Conrad Murray told police he used to help the entertainer sleep as he prepared for the concerts set to start two weeks later. The insurer contends AEG hid Jackson's health problems and failed to respond to repeated requests for his medical history when applying for insurance for the 50 shows scheduled for London's O2 Arena. The wrongful-death suit, filed by Katherine Jackson and her son's three children, contends that AEG contributed to the pop star's death by pressuring him to prepare even though the promoters knew he was in a weak condition and by its hiring and supervision of Dr. Murray. Murray was convicted of involuntary manslaughter and sentenced to four years in prison last year. ""Defendants did not hire Dr. Murray nor were they responsible for the death of Michael Jackson,"" AEG lawyer Putnam told CNN Tuesday. Randy Phillips, the president of AEG Live -- the concert-promotion branch of AEG -- called Jackson's death ""a terrible tragedy"" in one e-mail written weeks after he died, adding ""but life must go on."" ""AEG will make a fortune from merch sales, ticket retention, the touring exhibition and the film/dvd,"" Phillips wrote. In fact, AEG Live was allowed to sell Jackson tour merchandise and share in the profits from the documentary ""This Is It,"" produced from rehearsal video. The e-mails suggest AEG Live's president saw Jackson's problems first-hand the day the pop star was to appear at the O2 Arena to publicly announce the shows. ""MJ is locked in his room drunk and despondent,"" Phillips wrote in a March 5, 2009, e-mail to AEG Live's parent company, the paper reported. ""I (am) trying to sober him up."" ""I screamed at him so loud the walls are shaking,"" Phillips wrote. ""He is an emotionally paralyzed mess riddled with self-loathing and doubt now that it is show time."" The promoter blamed London traffic when Jackson was 90 minutes late for the announcement that day. ""He's as healthy as he can be -- no health problems whatsoever,"" Phillips told CNN two months later to refute reports Jackson's health was threatening the concerts. The Los Angeles Times story, however, said the e-mails indicated major doubts about Jackson's ability to perform. ""We cannot be forced into stopping this, which MJ will try to do because he is lazy and constantly changes his mind to fit his immediate wants,"" AEG Live executive Paul Gongaware e-mailed to Phillips. Jackson's missed rehearsals in June triggered concerns in e-mails that he was slow in learning his dance routines and would have to lip-sync on stage, the newspaper reported. ""MJ is not in shape enough yet to sing this stuff live and dance at the same time,"" one e-mail from the show's music director read, the paper reported. A production manager wrote: ""He was a basket case. Doubt is pervasive."" A loud warning from show director Kenny Ortega, who worked closely with Jackson on previous tours, came in mid-June, just over a week before his death. Ortega wrote to Phillips that Jackson had ""strong signs of paranoia, anxiety and obsessive-like behavior"" and suggesting they bring a ""top psychiatrist in to evaluate him ASAP."" ""It is like there are two people there. One (deep inside) trying to hold on to what he was and still can be and not wanting us to quit him, the other in this weakened and troubled state,"" Ortega wrote. ""I believe we need professional guidance in this matter."" Ortega testified at Murray's trial about his concerns about Jackson's frail condition and missed rehearsals. It resulted in a meeting six days before Jackson's death in which Murray assured the promoters he would have Jackson ready for rehearsals that next week. An e-mail from Phillips after that meeting said he had confidence in Murray ""who I am gaining immense respect for as I get to deal with him more."" ""This doctor is extremely successful (we check everyone out) and does not need this gig, so he (is) totally unbiased and ethical,"" Phillips' e-mail said.","NEW: AEG's lawyer calls it ""convenient"" Howard Mann accepted responsibility for leak .

"(CNN) -- Although residents often like to joke that it is, the mosquito isn't actually Alaska's official state bird. (That'd be the willow ptarmigan.) You also won't see many coconut trees growing in the far north. Judging by signage along Grande Drive in Denali, Alaska, however, you might not necessarily know those things. Appearing along the steep, winding ascent to the top of Sugarloaf Mountain, road signs depicting giant mosquitoes carrying off human prey and warning of falling coconuts are clearly meant to get a laugh out of drivers. Just less than a mile long and costing about $1 million to build, the mostly dirt road (some sharp corners are paved) leads to the Grande Denali Lodge. Construction on the road began in 2000; the hotel opened in 2002. Installed in stages over the past four or five years, according to Grande Denali Lodge general manager Joe Merrill, the signs were the brainchild of Dennis Brandon, a marketing consultant for the hotel who has a long history in the hospitality industry in Alaska. ""The collection has been added to each year,"" says Merrill. ""The ideas (for the signs) now come out of different peoples' minds."" Tiny town, big mountains . More a small collection of businesses than a town, the bulk of Denali (also unofficially referred to as ""The Canyon"" and Glitter Gulch) is located less than two miles from the entrance to Denali National Park and Preserve. The park is home to some of the greatest wildlife viewing opportunities in the world -- grizzly bear, moose, Dall sheep, caribou, 35 other species of mammals and 169 species of birds are often visible from the park's single road in spring, summer and fall. The park's centerpiece is Mount McKinley (also called ""Denali""), North America's highest peak at 20,237 feet (6,168 meters). The village of Denali has only about 160 year-round residents. Those numbers swell during the summer season when area hotels, restaurants and shops reopen with the spring thaw and start of the tourist season. Located at the top of Grande Drive, Grande Denali Lodge is one of the area's largest hotels. It's Alpenglow Restaurant and Lounge has an outdoor deck from which visitors can take in monster views facing southward toward the park entrance. As for the broader purpose of the signs, Merrill suggests it's about more than just laughs. ""I guess they're also a way to take peoples' attention away from the side of the road with the cliffs,"" he says. ""I'm pretty sure we're not done with the signs. Stay tuned to see what our warped minds come up with next.""","Drivers ascending Grande Drive in Denali, Alaska, are kept entertained by a succession of unexpected signs .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- One of Dr. Conrad Murray's girlfriends described Tuesday a phone call with Murray that was suddenly interrupted with the ""mumbling of voices"" and coughing -- a moment prosecutors suggest is when the doctor realized there was a problem with Michael Jackson. A Houston, Texas, cocktail waitress was one three Murray girlfriends called by the prosecution Tuesday morning in the involuntary manslaughter trial of Murrary, who was Jackson's doctor. The Las Vegas pharmacist who supplied Dr. Murray with the drugs prosecutors contend killed Michael Jackson also testified in a court day that ended two hours early because of witnesses scheduling issues. Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Michael Pastor limited how deep prosecutors could dig into Murray's social relationships with the women, but all three said they met Murray in Las Vegas night clubs. A fourth woman testified Monday she dated him after meeting in a Houston bar. The prosecution contends that one reason Murray is criminally responsible for Jackson's death is because phone calls and text messages to these women, other patients and employees at his clinics caused him to ignore his patient while administering dangerous drugs. While the courtroom presence of the women may help prosecutors convince jurors about Murray's moral character, each of them offered important testimony about Murray's activities on June 25, 2009, the day Jackson died. Michelle Bella testified that she met Murray at a Las Vegas ""social club"" where she was working in February 2008. Murray sent Bella a cell phone text message at 8:35 a.m. the day Jackson died, but the judge did not allow the prosecution to read it. Judge Pastor also would not let the jury hear a voice message Murray left on Bella's cell phone nine days earlier. But Bella did answer 'yes' when asked if Murray had told her he hoped to ""meet up with you"" later at a club in Las Vegas before he left for London with Jackson. The judge ordered that testimony stricken from the court record, but jurors clearly heard it. Prosecutors argue that Murray, who was Jackson's personal physician as he prepared for planned comeback concerts, is criminally responsible for the singer's death because of medical negligence and his reckless use of the surgical anesthetic propofol to help Jackson sleep. The coroner ruled that Jackson's death on June 25, 2009, was the result of ""acute propofol intoxication"" in combination with sedatives. Murray's defense lawyers contend Jackson caused his own death by swallowing eight lorazepam pills and orally ingesting propofol while Murray was out of the room. Sade Anding, a cocktail waitress who met Murray when she was working at a Houston steakhouse, testified Tuesday that Murray called her at 11:51 a.m. that day. Anding said she did all the talking for five or six minutes ""telling him about my day"" but that she realized he had stopped responding to her. That moment, about 11:57 a.m., is when prosecutors contend Murray first realized that Jackson had stopped breathing. ""I said 'Hello, hello, are you there?"" Anding testified. She said when she pressed her cell phone against her ear, ""I heard the mumbling of voices... and I heard coughing, and nobody answered."" Anding hung up the phone about three minutes later, she said. Murray, who is married, lived with Nicole Alvarez, 29, at the time he was working as Jackson's personal physician in the 2009. Murray took Alvarez and their newborn son to visit with Jackson at his home in March 2009, she testified. ""I was speechless when I met him,"" Alvarez said about the first of several visits with the pop icon. ""I couldn't believe I was meeting Michael Jackson."" Murray called her from the ambulance while on the way to the hospital with Jackson, Alvarez testified. ""I remember him telling me, that he was on the way to the hospital in the ambulance with Mr. Jackson and for me not to be alarmed,"" Alvarez said. ""He didn't want me to be worry, because he knew I would learn this through the news."" Pharmacist Tim Lopez, who followed Alvarez on the witness stand Tuesday, testified he sold and shipped more than four gallons of propofol to the Santa Monica apartment where Murray lived with Alvarez. Randy and Rebbie Jackson were the only Jackson siblings in court Tuesday. Katherine Jackson left the country last weekend to attend a Cirque du Soleil premiere in Montreal, Canada, and she is not expected to return until after this weekend's ""Michael Forever"" tribute in Cardiff, Wales. The judge ordered lawyers not to disclose to reporters ahead of time who they will call as witnesses, but they've been closely following the order used in the preliminary hearing. Los Angeles Police Homicide Detective Dan Myers, who led the Los Angeles Police Department investigation of Jackson's death, and coroner's Investigator Elissa Fleak will probably testify Tuesday or Wednesday, based on that pattern. On Monday, the emergency room doctor who declared Jackson dead testified that there was no way doctors could have revived the pop icon after he arrived at the hospital. Dr. Richelle Cooper said Murray never told her that he had given Jackson propofol before he stopped breathing, but it would not have made a difference if he had because Jackson ""had died long before."" ""It is unlikely with that information that I would have been able to do something different that would have changed the outcome,"" Cooper said. Prosecutors argue that Murray's failure to tell paramedics and doctors trying to resuscitate Jackson about the propofol is one of the negligent acts that make him criminally responsible for Jackson's death. Another doctor testified Monday that the decision to place an aortic balloon pump in Jackson's heart was ""a desperate attempt, even though very much futile"" intended ""to prepare Dr. Murray mentally to accept the fact that Mr. Jackson could not be rescued and would allow Mr. Jackson to depart in peace and dignity."" Dr. Thao Nguyen said Murray asked that ""we not to give up easily and try to save Mr. Michael Jackson's life,"" Nguyen said, even though it seemed hopeless. They placed a balloon pump in Jackson's aorta in an unsuccessful effort to restart his heart, she said. ""It's not a case of too little, too late, but a case of too late,"" Nguyen said. Cooper had recommended at 12:57 p.m., when Jackson was still at his home, that paramedics stop resuscitation efforts and declare him dead. Jackson was the first patient she had ever treated in the emergency room after having made such a recommendation to paramedics in the field, she said. ""I have never given a time of death in the field and then have that patient brought to me,"" she said. She said this exception was not because Jackson was a celebrity, but because the patient had a physician with him who did not want them to give up. Prosecutors have criticized Murray, who is a cardiologist, for using propofol on Jackson, contending it should be used only by anesthesiologists who have proper monitoring equipment. Cooper, a prosecution witness, acknowledged under questioning by defense lawyer Michael Flanagan that she uses it regularly as an emergency room doctor. If convicted of involuntary manslaughter, Murray could spend four years in a California prison and lose his medical license.","Girlfriend describes call with Murray when prosecutors say he realized Jackson stopped breathing .

"Washington (CNN) -- It is a case at the intersection of science and finance, an evolving 21st century dispute that comes down to a simple question: Should the government allow patents for human genes? The Supreme Court offered little other than confusion during oral arguments on Monday on nine patents held by a Utah biotech firm. Myriad Genetics isolated two related types of biological material, BRCA-1 and BRCA-2, linked to increased hereditary risk for breast and ovarian cancer. At issue is whether ""products of nature"" can be treated the same as ""human-made"" inventions, and held as the exclusive intellectual property of individuals and companies. A ruling is expected by late June. On one side, scientists and companies argue patents encourage medical innovation and investment that saves lives. On the other, patient rights groups and civil libertarians counter the patent holders are ""holding hostage"" the diagnostic care and access of information available to high-risk patients. How human genes become patented . Outside the court, several protesters held signs, such as ""Your corporate greed is killing my friends"" and ""My genes are not property."" The justices asked tough questions, raising a number of colorful hypotheticals to explore the boundaries of patent law, including whether things like baseball bats, leaves from exotic Amazon River plants, and the human liver could get federal government protection. ""The patent law is filled with uneasy compromises, because on the one hand, we do want people to invent,"" said Justice Stephen Breyer. ""On the other hand, we're very worried about them tying up some kind of whatever it is, particularly a thing that itself could be used for further advance."" Justice Anthony Kennedy noted Myriad made a significant investment in time and money in its genetic ""discoveries"" and might be allowed to have two-decade control over the genes for research, diagnostics, and treatment. ""I just don't think we can decide the case on the ground: oh, don't worry about investment, it'll come"" if there was no patent protection. But Justice Sonia Sotomayor used a ""chocolate chip"" cookie analogy to say merely isolating naturally derived products would normally not get you a patent, only for the particular process or use of the cookie. ""If I combust those in some new way, I can get a patent on that,"" she said. ""But I can't imagine getting a patent simply on the basic items of salt, flour and eggs, simply because I've created a new use or a new product from those ingredients."" The patent system was created more than two centuries ago with a dual purpose. One is to offer temporary financial incentives for those at the ground floor of innovative products like the combustible engine and the X-ray machine. The second is to ensure one company does not hold a lifetime monopoly that might discourage competition and consumer affordability. All patent submissions rely on a complex reading of applicable laws, distinguishing between abstract ideas and principles, and more tangible scientific discoveries and principles. Medical science had traditionally shunned patents. A famous example cited in numerous briefs in the current appeal involved Dr. Jonas Salk's development and invention of the polio oral vaccine in 1952. When his life-saving treatment was announced, he said the people would ""own"" the vaccine, adding ""Could you patent the sun?"" Maybe not the sun, but in the past 31 years, 20 percent of the human genome has been protected under U.S. patents. All sides agree the science of isolating the building blocks of life is no easy task. Myriad has said it has spent several years and hundreds of millions of dollars in its research. Since Myriad owns the patent on breast cancer genes, it is the only company that can perform tests for potential abnormalities. An initial test catches most problems, but the company also offers a second, separate test, called BART, to detect the rest, a diagnostic that can cost several thousand dollars. ""We invest heavily in the research and development that is needed to discover and provide high-quality molecular diagnostic products that save and improve patients' lives,'' said Richard Marsh, executive vice president and general counsel at Myriad. ""Strong intellectual property and patent rights in the United States are critical to fulfilling our mission."" The company says 1 million patients have benefited from its BRAC Analysis technology, and that about 250,000 such tests are performed yearly. And officials say the average out-of-pocket expense for the testing is only about $100, a figure disputed by the plaintiffs. All sides agree too, the BCRA testing has saved countless lives since it was first unveiled in 1996, giving at-risk women the option of having their breasts removed as a preventive measure. But some patients have complained charging so much for a second test is ""irresponsible,"" and a sign the bio-tech company is more interested in profits than patient care for those unable to afford the second analysis. It is a charge the company strongly denies. Among those challenging the Myriad patents are sisters Eileen Kelly and Kathleen Maxian. Kelly was diagnosed with breast cancer at age 40. The initial BCRA test proved negative, meaning her family members were not likely at risk. But Maxian later developed ovarian cancer. The second BART testing proved positive, meaning the siblings carry the cancer-causing mutation all along. ""It could have prevented my cancer, or at least caught it early,"" Maxian told CNN's Senior Medical Correspondent Elizabeth Cohen. ""Now my cancer is so advanced, I have only a 20-percent chance of being alive five years from now. I'm so angry."" Money was not an issue for them, but Kelly and Maxian, along with a coalition of physician groups and genetic counselors say Myriad has not made the BART tests widely available for patients without a strong family history of these kinds of cancers. ""Myriad did not invent the human genes at issue in this case,"" Christopher Hansen of the ACLU told the court at argument. He is representing the plaintiffs bring the initial lawsuit. ""Myriad deserves credit for having unlocked these secrets. Myriad does not deserve a patent for it."" But several justices raised concerns. ""Isolating or extracting natural products has long been considered patentable,"" said Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, echoing what the company has argued - and won in lower courts. She offered examples like ""aspirin and whooping cough vaccine. How is this different from those starting as natural products?"" Justice Samuel Alito used the example of a newly discovered plant with ""tremendous medicinal purposes."" ""It's not just the case of taking the leaf off the tree and chewing it"" to treat breast cancer. ""Let's say if you do that, you'd have to eat a whole forest to get the value of this. But it's extracted and reduced to a concentrated form. That's not eligible for a patent?"" Justices Elena Kagan and Antonin Scalia put a financial spin on the question. ""Why would a company incur massive investment if it cannot patent?"" an isolated gene, asked Scalia. When told by Hansen that scientific ""curiosity"" or Nobel Prize recognition might be enough, Scalia seemed unsatisfied. ""Well, that's lovely,"" he said somewhat sarcastically. On the other side Myriad attorney Gregory Castanias said ""the parade of horribles"" raised by the plaintiffs had not happened. ""There's no dispute in this case that there has been some alteration of the isolated DNA molecules."" He said there has been an ""explosion in biotechnology and the successful, economically successful, technologically successful, and life-saving industry that is at the heart of these inventions."" But Kennedy disputed Castanias' assertion this patent was deserved because of ""different economic values"" in cutting-edge genetic science-- and that patients did not have the ""human ingenuity"" of the BCRA test before Myriad developed it. ""Well, we could have said that with atomic energy, with electric, but so far the choice of the patent law was that we have a uniform rule for all industries,"" Kennedy said. ""That avoids giving special industries special subsidies, which is very important it seems to me."" Chief Justice Roberts repeated the concerns of several colleagues, when saying the gene patents were much different from those for pharmaceuticals and other medical advances. ""There, you're obviously combining things and getting something new. Here you're just snipping [the genetic line], and you don't have anything new, you have something that is a part of something that has existed previous to your intervention."" The federal government is taking a somewhat middle ground: DNA itself is not patentable but so-called ""cDNA"" can be. Complementary DNA is artificially synthesized from the genetic template, and engineered to produce gene clones. Use of this protein-isolating procedure, known as ""tagging,"" is especially important in mapping and cataloguing the vast human genome. Solicitor General Donald Verrilli also suggested Congress could create exceptions in the genetic or bio-tech testing arena, over so-called ""use"" patents for specific procedures. The high court has addressed the broader issue before, and may use a 2012 decision to guide the current human gene case. In the so-called ""Mayo"" case, the justices unanimously said patents could not be issued on observations of a natural phenomenon -- in this case a doctor's medical diagnosis of a patient's reaction to a drug. ""If a law of nature is not patentable, than neither is a process reciting a law of nature, unless that process has additional features that provide practical assurance that the process is more than a drafting effort designed to monopolize the law of nature itself,"" wrote Breyer for the court in Mayo. The current case is Association for Molecular Pathology v. Myriad Genetics (12-398).","Oral arguments held on case involving nine patents held by biotech firm .
Myriad Genetics isolated two types of material linked to hereditary risk for two cancers .
Conventional patents are held as the exclusive intellectual property of the inventor .

"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- Katherine Jackson's court challenge of the men who control Michael Jackson's estate will continue, although her lawyer said he hopes a judge's decision will lead to an out-of-court settlement. Katherine Jackson and Joe Jackson attend the funeral for their son on September 3 in Glendale, California. Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Mitchell Beckloff ruled last week that Katherine Jackson, the pop star's mother, could safely contest the executors without risking her benefits from her son's will, a judge ruled. ""She will never lose her inheritance,"" Jackson lawyer Londell McMillan said. ""Nonetheless, Mrs. Jackson's court victory does not comfort her grieving over the loss of her beloved son Michael Jackson."" Burt Levitch, another Jackson family lawyer, has said they have questions about possible conflicts of interest and the fitness of John Branca and John McClain, who were named as executors in the will the singer signed in 2002. Although the probate process is not complete, Beckloff gave Branca and McClain temporary control of the estate as special administrators. The judge still must review and approve major contracts. A provision in Michael Jackson's will said that any beneficiaries who contest it could be risking their benefits, but Beckloff's ruling said Katherine Jackson's challenge of executors ""would not be a contest within the meaning of the trust's no-contest clause."" Beckloff has set aside a week in mid-November for a trial to determine whether Branca and McClain are fit to run the pop icon's estate. But McMillan suggested in a written statement Monday that the leverage given the family by the ruling may be enough. ""We now hope to resolve the outstanding administration matter, without further costly litigation, in the best interests of the beneficiaries, which are Mrs. Jackson and her grandchildren,"" the attorney said. Court papers made public Thursday revealed that Michael Jackson's mother and his three children are getting an allowance totaling more than $86,000 a month from the estate. The money is in addition to the maintenance of the home -- which is owned by the estate -- in Encino, California, where Katherine Jackson lives with her grandchildren, the documents said. She was granted custody of her son's three children soon after Michael Jackson's June 25 death. She and the children were named beneficiaries, along with unnamed charities, in Jackson's 2002 will. Petitions filed by Branca and McClain in July, and later approved by Beckloff, outlined $26,804 in monthly expenses for Katherine Jackson. The largest amount from that -- $4,722 -- goes to pay for an assistant for her. Another $3,500 each month is budgeted for clothing for Jackson, who is 79. She's also given $2,000 each for a housekeeper and driver, and she has a $1,500 entertainment allowance each month, the documents said. The details of the children's budget are mostly blacked out at the request of their lawyer, Margaret Lodise. She told the judge that there was concern someone could use the financial information to pose as one of the children online. She told CNN that the family was aware of people posing as Jackson children with Twitter accounts. The documents did reveal that the three children get a combined $60,000 a month from their father's estate. They pay $14,600 a month for salaries and payroll taxes for people who take care of them, according to the petition. The children also get $13,260 each month for entertainment and related expenses, the papers said. The petition estimated that Michael Jackson's estate is worth at least $500 million and is growing. Major deals have been reached in the past month that are expected to add tens of millions of dollars to the estate, including a movie and music deal with Sony. CNN's Oscar Merino contributed to this report.","Katherine Jackson lawyer has hopes for settlement with son's estate executors .

"New York (CNN) -- The developer behind the controversial Islamic community center and mosque planned for Lower Manhattan has requested federal funding through the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation to support the project known as Park51. The funding would come from money the Department of Housing and Urban Development allocated to help rebuild the neighborhood after the 9/11 attacks. ""Park51 has applied for a Lower Manhattan Development Corporation grant,"" said Sharif El-Gamal, CEO of SOHO Properties, the developer behind the Islamic center. In a statement, El-Gamal said the money would ""in part fund social service programs such as domestic violence programs, Arabic and other foreign language classes, programs and services for homeless veterans, two multi-cultural art exhibits and immigration services."" The Lower Manhattan Development Corporation received more than 265 applications seeking more than $175 million for community and cultural programs, though the LMDC has only $17 million of federal funding to allocate. ""We are now turning to the challenging but important task of sorting through the applications to identify those that address long-standing community and cultural needs,"" said Avi Schick, chairman of LMDC. The grants will range from $100,000 to $1 million, according to Julie Menin, chair of Community Board 1 and a member of the LMDC board. Among the criteria used to judge applications, Menin said, are financial viability, job creation, revitalizing the community and a track record of service in Lower Manhattan. ""We have funded museums, public schools, programs to help small businesses hurt after 9/11,"" said Menin. An online report said Park51 had requested $5 million, but neither the developer nor LMDC board members would confirm that amount. The LMDC plans to decide how to allocate the $17 million ""towards the end of the first quarter of next year,"" said Menin. Park51 has yet to raise significant funds for the community center located two blocks north of Ground Zero, a project that could cost $100-million. ""Park51 has not launched a formal fundraising program and is currently in the process of expanding its Board of Directors to plan, manage and oversee such efforts,"" said El-Gamal, adding that the project has not yet applied for federal tax-exempt status, but plans to do so ""in the coming weeks.""","Developer has asked Lower Manhattan Development Corp. for funds .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- A planned Michael Jackson tribute concert, supported by the late pop star's mother and four siblings, was in disarray Thursday amid family squabbling and the apparent failure of promoters to sign any big-name acts so far. Tickets for the show, scheduled for Cardiff, Wales, in October, were to go on sale Thursday, but instead of providing a link for purchases the promoter's website asked fans to ""Please Standby for further announcements."" The head of the British company promoting the concert promised last week it would ""feature the world's most amazing music performers."" The roster would be revealed online one act at a time over the next 10 days weeks, Global Live Events CEO Chris Hunt told reporters at a July 25 news conference. ""Everybody's in the midst of signing contracts so nothing can be announced until that happens,"" Juliette Harris, spokeswoman for Global Live Events, told CNN late Tuesday. She suggested an announcement would come Wednesday. By Thursday, still no acts had been announced. The problems started soon after brothers Marlon, Tito and Jackie, sister La Toya and family matriarch Katherine Jackson attended the ""Michael Forever: The Tribute Concert"" announcement at the Beverly Hills Hotel on July 25. La Toya Jackson said it was ""something that's spectacular"" while the Jacksons' mother called it ""a show fit for a king."" ""If my son were here today, he would feel the same way,"" Katherine Jackson said. ""I know my brother would be very, very proud to see all the artists that he admired and respected so much coming together for this event,"" Tito Jackson said. But an hour later, Jermaine and Randy Jackson, the only brothers not at the news conference, issued a sharply worded statement that reflected a deep division within the Jackson family over the show. ""We want to make clear that this does not reflect the position of the entire family,"" the two brothers said in a joint statement. ""While we wholeheartedly support the spirit of a tribute that honors our brother, we find it impossible to support an event that is due to take place during the criminal trial surrounding Michael's death."" While Hunt had hinted it could include a Jackson brothers reunion, the statement from Jermaine and Randy Jackson made it clear that would not happen. ""In light of this, we feel it is inappropriate to be involved with such an ill-timed event and its promoter, Global Live,"" Randy and Jermaine Jackson said. Their statement said the idea of the October concert was presented to the entire family in April ""as an idea already in its advanced stages."" The decision to go ahead with it ""disrespects opinions and wishes expressed in the strongest terms"" by some members of the Jackson family, they said. The Michael Jackson Fan Club agreed with the two brothers, issuing a similar statement. ""We share their concerns that this concert is taking place at a most inappropriate time when everyone's care and attention should be focused on the matter of justice. We believe that, as stated by Jermaine and Randy, the most important tribute we can give to Michael Jackson at this time is to seek justice in his name."" Jackson fans posted messages on the concert's Facebook page questioning ticket prices and the process for buying them. Fans must place bids for a chance to buy a ticket. The higher their pledge to a charity, the better their chances of getting a good seat. ""The ticket system is so bad!! the higher you bid the better seats you get?? not every Michael fan is rich!!!"" one fan posted on the ""Michael Forever Tribute"" Facebook page Thursday. After several days of such negative posts, a link to the Facebook page was removed from the concert's website. The October 8 show, in the Wales Millennium Centre in Cardiff, which seats 75,000 people, would be at least four hours long, Hunt said. In addition to the other problems surrounding the event, a spokesman for Michael Jackson's estate said last week that the promoters never sought or obtained permission from the estate's executors to use late pop singer's name or image. ""The estate has not been contacted and is not involved with Global Live Events in the UK tribute concert announced today,"" spokesman Jim Bates told CNN.","NEW: Online ticket sales are suspended for the show .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Michael Jackson probably died after he rapidly injected himself with a dose of the surgical anesthetic propofol on top of a large dose of sedatives he swallowed when Dr. Conrad Murray was away, the defense's propofol expert testified Friday. The prosecution theory of how Jackson died requires ""an incredible coincidence of circumstances"" using a ""befuddling"" IV drip configuration and an ""irrational"" assumption about how Murray injected sedatives, Dr. Paul White testified. White, the last defense witness in Murray's involuntary manslaughter trial, challenged the assumptions used by prosecution anesthesia expert Dr. Steven Shafer to conclude that Jackson's death was caused by an infusion of the surgical anesthetic propofol set up by Murray. Deputy district attorney David Walgren will take the weekend to confer with Shafer before beginning his cross-examination of White on Monday morning. Closing arguments could be heard as soon as Tuesday in the trial that started a month ago, depending on how long the prosecution takes with its questioning of White and if it chooses to recall Shafer in rebuttal. The defense theory is that a desperate Jackson, fearing that his comeback concerts could be canceled unless he found elusive sleep, self-administered propofol that Murray was trying to wean him off of. It contends that Jackson also swallowed eight lorazepam tablets while Murray was not watching. Shafer conceded last week that it was possible that Jackson, not Murray, could have been the one to open the IV drip to a fatal pace, but prosecutors contend that it would make no difference in Murray's guilt. Murray is responsible for Jackson's death even if he did not give him the final and fatal dose, because he was criminally reckless in using the surgical anesthetic to help Jackson sleep without proper precautions, the prosecution contends. White testified Friday that it is his opinion Jackson died after he injected himself with a 25-milligram dose of propofol between 11:30 a.m. and noon June 25, 2009. Testimony and phone records indicated it was about noon that Murray realized Jackson was not breathing. White theorized that Jackson could have ""pushed"" the drug into an catheter in his leg using a syringe over a 15- to 30-second period, much faster than a doctor would have done. ""I believe it could potentially have lethal consequences,"" White testified. White also concluded that Jackson swallowed a large dose of lorazepam several hours earlier, which would have left ""a very high concentration"" of the sedative in his body. ""So you've got drugs that have additive or even synergistic effects, and I think the combination effect would be very profound,"" White said. Shafer, who testified over an 11-day span for the prosecution, concluded the ""only scenario"" that fits the scientific evidence -- mainly the drug levels found in Jackson's blood after his death -- is that Jackson was on an IV drip of propofol for three hours before his death. White, however, testified Friday that with such a flow of propofol, Jackson would have been ""sleepy but arousable but breathing spontaneously."" It would not have killed him, he said. The 100-milliliter propofol bottle prosecutors believe Murray used was empty when investigators found it, leading Shafer to conclude that the last drops entered Jackson's body just as his heart stopped beating. White called it ""an incredible coincidence of circumstances"" that the bottle would empty exactly when Jackson died. The defense expert also questioned the prosecution contention that Murray placed the propofol bottle into an empty saline bag with an opening cut into it to suspend it from the IV stand next to Jackson's bed. It would have been more logical for Murray to use a plastic suspension tab built onto the bottle, a routine practice. ""It's befuddling to me, because anyone picking up the bottle would naturally gravitate for pulling up the little hanger,"" White said. ""Why would you go to all the hassle?"" Hanging the bottle inside a bag also would not work because if Jackson ""rolled over and moved his leg, it would easily come out of the bag,"" White said. The suspension tab on the propofol bottle had not been activated, both sides agreed. Investigators who recovered the bottle and an opened bag testified they found them together, but they did not photograph it. White also questioned Shafer's computer model conclusion that Murray gave Jackson at least nine four-milligram injections of the sedative lorazepam at regular intervals from 1:30 to 5 a.m. the day he died. Those ""enormous"" sedative doses alone would have put anyone to sleep and possibly killed them, White said. He said it would be ""irrational"" for a doctor to sit at Jackson's bedside and repeatedly injected the sedatives to a patient in very deep sedation, as Shafer's theory implies. Friday's court session, which lasted only three hours, was attended by Michael Jackson's father, Joe, sister Janet and brother Randy. Brother Jermaine Jackson's daughter, Autumn, and Randy's son, Randy Jackson Jr., also sat in court. Kathy Hilton, who was a childhood friend of Michael Jackson's, and her husband, Rick Hilton were also in court Friday.","NEW: Michael Jackson died soon after self-injecting propofol, Dr. Paul White testifies .

"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- Katherine Jackson's battle for control of her pop star son's estate is about to take a ""new direction"" based on ""new evidence"" uncovered by the family, a Jackson family lawyer said. Katherine Jackson, with Michael in 2005, is challenging the appointment of Michael's estate trustees. The revelation came from attorney Londell McMillan, who also corrected a report that he was one of the lawyers Katherine Jackson replaced Thursday. McMillan pointed to questions about the authenticity of the signature on Michael Jackson's will as reported this week by celebrity gossip Web site TMZ. Randy Jackson said his brother could not have signed the will -- which was dated July 7, 2002, in Los Angeles -- because he was in New York that day, according to the TMZ report. Until now, the Jacksons have not challenged the will's authenticity in court. Katherine Jackson's objections, instead, have centered on what her lawyers said were possible conflicts of interest by the two men named in the will as executors. She replaced the two lawyers who were handling the probate case Thursday with Adam Streisand, an estate litigation lawyer whose past clients have included the estates of Marlon Brando and Ray Charles. ""The case is now moving in a different direction, and the family thought it was best to bring on Adam Streisand's law firm,"" McMillan said. ""The evidence precipitated the change and the need to take it in a new direction."" Contrary to statements made at court Thursday, McMillan was not one of the lawyers replaced, Katherine Jackson said Friday. ""Londell McMillan remains my personal attorney and counsel,"" she said in a written statement. ""Despite false reports, he was never replaced or terminated."" The Jackson estate is currently controlled by John Branca and John McClain, who would become permanent executors unless Jackson's will is challenged. Katherine Jackson's legal team has asked that a member of the Jackson family ""have a seat at the table"" as a third executor. Under the 2002 will, Michael Jackson's three children and his mother are the chief beneficiaries of his estate, while unnamed charities will share in 20 percent of the wealth.","""The case is now moving in a different direction,"" attorney Londell McMillan said .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- A ""smoking gun"" e-mail allegedly connecting a concert promoter to Michael Jackson's death was revealed this week as a judge unsealed documents in the wrongful death lawsuit filed by Jackson's mother and children. The trial next month in Los Angeles could shed new light on the pop icon's last days as Dr. Conrad Murray, who did not testify at his own involuntary manslaughter trial, and Jackson's oldest son Prince, 16, are on the witness list. Jackson died two weeks before his ""This Is It"" comeback concerts, organized by AEG Live, were to have debuted in London in the summer of 2009. E-mails suggested that the promoter was worried about Jackson's missed rehearsals and they sought Murray's help in getting him ready. Prince, Paris and Blanket Jackson and their grandmother, Katherine Jackson, contend that AEG Live's pressure on Murray to have Michael Jackson ready for daily rehearsals despite his fragile health led to his death from an overdose of surgical anesthetic. The judge ruled Wednesday that Jackson lawyers have shown enough evidence that AEG Live hired and supervised Murray to warrant a jury trial. She also ruled there was evidence to support the Jacksons' claim that AEG Live executives could have foreseen that Murray would use dangerous drugs in treating the pop icon. ""Now that the court has ruled that there is evidence that it was foreseeable that AEG's actions resulted in Michael Jackson's death, the Jackson family feels vindicated from the public smear campaign that AEG has waged against them,"" Jackson lawyer Kevin Boyle said Sunday. ""The truth about what happened to Michael, which AEG has tried to keep hidden from the public since the day Michael died, is finally emerging. We look forward to the trial where the rest of the story will come to light."" A cornerstone of the Jacksons' case is an e-mail AEG Live Co-CEO Paul Gongaware wrote 11 days before Jackson's June 25, 2009, death. The e-mail to show director Kenny Ortega addressed concerns that Murray had kept Jackson from a rehearsal the day before: ""We want to remind (Murray) that it is AEG, not MJ, who is paying his salary. We want to remind him what is expected of him."" Jackson lawyers, calling it a ""smoking gun,"" argue the e-mail is evidence that AEG Live used Murray's fear of losing his $150,000-a-month job as Jackson's personal physician to pressure him to have Jackson ready for rehearsals despite his fragile health. Ortega, who had worked closely with Jackson on previous tours, sounded a loud warning about his health after Jackson showed up for a rehearsal shivering just over a week before his death. He wrote in an e-mail to AEG Live President Randy Phillips: ""It is like there are two people there. One (deep inside) trying to hold on to what he was and still can be and not wanting us to quit him, the other in this weakened and troubled state. I believe we need professional guidance in this matter."" Phillips responded with a glowing endorsement of Murray: ""This doctor is extremely successful (we check everyone out) and does not need this gig so he is totally unbiased and ethical."" Jackson lawyers point to another e-mail exchange as evidence that Phillips was directly involved with pressuring Murray to have Jackson at rehearsals. The e-mail was sent by AEG Live tour accountant Timm Woolley to an insurance broker two days before Jackson died: ""Randy Phillips and Dr. Murray are responsible for MJ rehearsal and attendance schedule."" Murray told investigators two days after Jackson's death that he used the surgical anesthetic propofol every night for two months to help him rest for rehearsals. It was a procedure Jackson demanded, he said. The Los Angeles County coroner ruled that Jackson had died from an overdose of propofol in combination with sedatives. Murray is serving a prison sentence for his involuntary manslaughter conviction. AEG Live argues it has no liability in Jackson's death because Murray was not its employee. AEG lawyer Marvin Putnam did not respond Sunday to CNN calls for comment, but he did give a short statement last year: ""Defendants did not hire Dr. Murray nor were they responsible for the death of Michael Jackson."" The lawsuit seeks a judgment against AEG Live equal to the money Jackson would have earned over the course of his remaining lifetime if he had not died in 2009. If AEG Live is found liable, it could cost the company several billion dollars, according to estimates of Jackson's income potential. AEG Live is a subsidiary of AEG, a global entertainment company that is now for sale with an $8 billion asking price. Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Yvette Palazuelos, in her ruling rejecting AEG Live's request to have the case thrown out, said she agreed that the Jackson lawyers provided evidence that AEG Live didn't do ""a sufficient background check of Dr. Murray, which would have established that Murray was deeply in debt."" Jackson's previous relationship with Murray, who treated him and his children for minor illnesses in Las Vegas, did not relieve AEG Live of liability, ""although the fact may be relevant in determining proportional liability and damages,"" she said. While the AEG Live lawyers argued the company could not have foreseen that Murray might use dangerous drugs on Jackson in preparation for the tour, Palazuelos said there was evidence that Gongaware had ""previous tour experiences"" with Jackson in which ""tour doctors"" gave ""large amounts of drugs/controlled substances to him."" Gongaware testified in Murray's trial that he worked as tour manager for Jackson's ""Dangerous"" and ""History"" tours before joining AEG Live. The judge cited ""Gongaware's general knowledge of the ethical issues surrounding 'tour doctors' and the practice of administering drugs to performing artists."" ""There is a triable issue of fact as to whether it was foreseeable that such a physician under strong financial pressure may compromise his Hippocratic Oath and do what was known by AEG Live's executives to be an unfortunate practice in the entertainment industry for financial gain,"" the judge wrote.

"New York (CNN) -- The head of a group that promotes Times Square said Friday that he will lobby the new mayor to regulate dozens of costumed characters who inhabit the popular tourist destination after the arrest on sex abuse charges of a man dressed as Woody from ""Toy Story."" A 44-year-old man was charged Thursday with three counts of forcible touching and three counts of third-degree sex abuse, said Detective Annette Markowski, a police spokeswoman. The victims were two females, ages 21 and 22. The alleged abuse occurred around 8 p.m. Thursday at Broadway and West 46th Street in the glowing Times Square district popularly known as the crossroads of the world. ""This is the latest in a long series of disturbing incidents that reinforce our belief that these costume characters must be licensed and regulated,"" said Tim Tompkins, president of the Times Square Alliance, a nonprofit that promotes business development in the area. ""We are looking forward to working with the new administration and City Council to come up with an equitable and effective regulatory solution."" Dozens of costumed cartoon characters and performers in Times Square have long solicited tips from tourists who have their pictures taken with them. City officials have struggled to regulate the characters without treading on their First Amendment rights. The characters and performers range from the Muppets to the scantily-clad, guitar-playing Naked Cowboy. ""Quirky is fine,"" Tompkins said. ""Creepy is not."" Tompkins told CNN that his organization had recently been in touch with the administration of former Mayor Michael Bloomberg about taking steps to reign in the costumed characters but the ex-mayor's term ended before any action could be taken. He said he has made preliminary contact with office of Mayor Bill de Blasio about the issue. De Blasio's office did not return calls seeking comment. ""The solution is to regulate and license these guys like any other business and then there's no first amendment issue,"" said Tompkins, referring to complaints that an all-out ban would violate freedom of expression. A spokeswoman for Tompkins' organization said the characters and performers are ""not officially endorsed by the intellectual property holders nor the Times Square Alliance."" Times Square, once a seedy neighborhood overrun with crime and porn theaters, has undergone a major facelift in recent decade, profiting from the draw of Broadway shows and its bright lights. A Times Square Alliance survey estimates that during high tourist summer months between 60 and 70 people gather around Times Square dressed in costumes or performing. Thursday night's sex abuse arrest was the latest bad news involving the popular Times Square characters. In April, a man dressed as the TV character Cookie Monster allegedly shoved a 2-year-old in Times Square after the child's parents refused the man's demand for $2 for posing for a photo, police said. The child was not physically injured. A 33-year-old man was arrested and charged with reckless endangerment and acting in a manner injurious to a minor. In addition, the alliance said, a Spider Man character was arrested for punching a woman in February 2013, and a man dressed as Super Mario groped a woman in 2012. Both incidents occurred in Times Square.","Times Square group seeks to regulate costumed characters .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Michael Jackson's sexual molestation trial is ""no-go territory"" for defense lawyers in the trial of Dr. Conrad Murray, a judge ruled Monday. Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Michael Pastor, however, will allow testimony from two doctors about what the defense contends was Jackson's request for the surgical anesthetic propofol, a drug the coroner ruled played a major role in his death. Defense lawyers appeared frustrated with the rejection of their witnesses, although they declined to speak to reporters about it as they left the downtown Los Angeles courthouse after Monday's hearing. Murray is charged with involuntary manslaughter in the June 25, 2009, death of Jackson, who would have turned 53 Monday. The defense wanted to have a Santa Barbara County, California, detective testify about drugs found at Jackson's Neverland estate during a search related to the sex charge. ""In particular, it is relevant to the defense that Michael Jackson possessed both propofol and Demerol in his residence as early as 2003,"" the defense said in a motion filed Monday. Los Angeles County Deputy District Attorney David Walgren argued testimony about drugs Jackson possessed in 2003 ""has absolutely nothing to do with the standard of medical care"" Murray gave Jackson the day he died on June 25, 2009. Bringing up anything about the molestation trial, which ended with Jackson's acquittal, would be ""character assassination on the victim,"" Walgren said. Defense lawyer Ed Chernoff, in a hearing Monday afternoon, assured the judge that he did not intend to question the detective about the sex charge, but only about drugs he found in his search. Murray's defense lawyers want to argue that Jackson was addicted to the painkiller Demerol and was undergoing withdrawal from the drug when he died, Chernoff said. He said he expects the prosecution will say he ""merely liked Demerol"" and was not addicted. Jackson's ""past drug addictions, use desires, possessions"" is relevant, Chernoff said in court. Pastor ruled that the events were too far in the past for this trial and could mislead the jury. ""Anything having to do with the year 2003, any incident with Neverland, Santa Barbara, medical doctors, fundamentally is irrelevant,"" Pastor said. ""It proves absolutely nothing with regard to the year 2009."" Pastor ruled that Beverly Hills dermatologist Dr. Arnold Klein could not be called to testify about giving Jackson Demerol shots. Testimony about Jackson's visits to Klein's office in the days before his death could lead the jury ""down the path of prescribing to Dr. Klein some sort of criminal culpability in the death of Mr. Jackson."" However, Klein's medical records can be used in the trial, he ruled. Two of Klein's office employees also cannot be called as witnesses, he ruled. Prosecutors in the trial of Murray, Jackson's last doctor, had asked the judge to exclude or limit the testimony of 26 witnesses Murray's lawyers said they might call. Pastor has indicated he would keep the trial limited to what happened the last several days of Jackson's life. His decisions on the prosecution's request to limit witnesses indicate how tightly the judge will limit the defense arguments. Other witnesses the judge said the defense could not call include John Branca, the lawyer who became executor of Jackson's estate after his death. Nothing about Jackson's finances can be considered, he said. The Los Angeles coroner has ruled that Jackson's death was caused by an overdose of the surgical anesthetic propofol, combined with other drugs. Prosecutors have accused Murray of having a role in the overdose. Jury selection is scheduled to begin on September 8, with opening statements expected to be heard on September 27. Lawyers estimate the trial will conclude in early November. If convicted on the involuntary manslaughter charge, Murray could face up to four years in prison.","NEW: Defense lawyers appear frustrated, but leave the courthouse in silence .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Prosecutors want another delay in the start of the involuntary manslaughter trial of Michael Jackson's doctor, but the judge will wait until next month to decide the request. ""I'm not surprised by all of this,"" Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Michael Pastor said during a hearing Friday. The trial has already been delayed twice since Dr. Conrad Murray invoked his right to a speedy trial after his arraignment in January. ""When I got myself involved in it, I said 'It ain't gonna happen,' "" Pastor said, referring to the original starting date of late March. The case has been ""creepy crawly,"" he said. Jury selection was under way in May when the defense requested a delay so its expert witnesses could have more time to prepare for new experts hired by the prosecution. Pastor then dismissed hundreds of prospective jurors and rescheduled the trial to start on September 8. Deputy District Attorney David Walgren said Friday morning that the prosecution needed another three weeks to prepare because of ""scheduling issues."" Defense lawyers did not object to moving jury selection to the end of September. Pastor, who said he ""rearranged all sort of cases, including capital cases"" to start the trial in September, said he would wait until a July 12 hearing to decide. Also on Friday, the judge approved a plan to allow defense lawyers and prosecutors to view dozens of hours of raw video shot of Michael Jackson's last rehearsals. The video was bought by Sony Pictures for its film ""This Is It."" Pastor hasn't ruled on what clips, if any, defense lawyers might be able to show at the trial. He has previously limited the prosecution to just raw video of Jackson's last two days alive. Saturday is the second anniversary of Jackson's death, which the Los Angeles coroner ruled was from an overdose of the surgical anesthetic propofol, combined with other drugs. Murray, who was hired as Jackson's personal physician as he prepared for his comeback concerts in London, is charged in the singer's death.","Dr. Conrad Murray's trial is now set to start September 8 .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Lawyers defending Michael Jackson's last doctor in his involuntary manslaughter trial have one day left to satisfy a judge's order that they hand over to prosecutors all of the statements and reports gathered from potential defense witnesses. California court rules require both sides to meet certain discovery requirements 30 days before a trial starts, which is Tuesday in the case of Dr. Conrad Murray, who is charged in the Jackson's 2009 death. ""We've been down this road before and I hope we don't have to go down it again,"" Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Michael Pastor said during a hearing Monday after prosecutors complained that the defense was holding back. Prosecutors have not seen statements from 76 of the 103 people on the defense witness list, documents which would let them know what they might testify about, Deputy District Attorney David Walgren said. ""We can resolve this,"" lead defense lawyer Ed Chernoff told the judge. The defense has insisted it has handed over everything its collected, but that many of the potential witnesses have not cooperated. Pastor ordered lawyers back to court Wednesday morning, 29 days before jury selection is set to begin, so he can ""get a handle"" on the discovery issues. The judge moved talks about jury selection from open court into his chambers Monday morning. The lawyers are drafting the questions they'll ask potential jurors next month. ""It never stops,"" Pastor said, referring to his concern that parts of the jury questionnaire might be leaked to the media. The 129 questions asked nearly 500 potential jurors in March and April were made public after the jury pool was whittled down to 171 people. But the process has to be repeated since the trial was postponed for several months to allow lawyers more time to prepare. Defense lawyers have said they are worried that jurors may be tainted by what they hear about the case on television, singling out HLN's Nancy Grace for delivering what they said amounted to nightly prosecution arguments during the Casey Anthony trial. The prosecution told Pastor Monday that they want him to review medical records for Murray's patients to decide if they could use them in the trial to demonstrate the doctor's prescription practices. None of the patients are related to the Jackson case, Walgren said. Pastor questioned the legality of prosecutors having private medical records protected by federal law without the patients' permission. ""I don't like going through people's personal medical records unless there's a specific reason,"" Pastor said. Law enforcement collected boxes of records in raids on Murray medical offices in Houston, Texas, and Las Vegas, Nevada. Jackson's death on June 25, 2009, was from an overdose of the surgical anesthetic propofol, combined with other drugs, the Los Angeles coroner ruled. Murray, whom Jackson hired to care for him as he prepared for his comeback concerts in London, allegedly administered the fatal dose.","Prosecutors complain defense lawyers have not met discovery requirements yet .

"Editor's Note: Sunny Hostin is a legal analyst for CNN and is also a managing director of business intelligence and investigations at Kroll Inc. Previously, Hostin served as an assistant U.S. attorney in Washington, D.C., where she received a Special Achievement Award for her work as a child sex crimes prosecutor. She also served as a trial attorney for the U.S. Department of Justice's Antitrust Division. Sunny Hostin says prostitution is not a victimless crime and johns should be charged. (CNN) -- We finally heard from Ashley Dupre -- or ""Kristin"" as former New York Gov. Eliot Spitzer knew her. But did we really hear much? I didn't. I wanted to know more about Eliot Spitzer, the man. I wanted to know how the former Sheriff of Wall Street became the Sheriff of Nottingham -- a do-gooder gone bad. A john. ""Client No. 9."" I wanted to know how he got such a sweetheart deal. How did a ruthless prosecutor get the type of mercy from the government that he rarely, if ever, was willing to give to those he went after? But when Diane Sawyer during her ""20/20"" interview got even close to that topic, Dupre replied, ""legally I've been advised not to discuss that."" And that makes sense, since she doesn't have an iron-clad immunity deal. If she has nothing in writing, she has to be careful. But what was striking about what I did hear was that Ashley Dupre is no different than the many prostitutes I had met during my time as a prosecutor. Her story, as told to Sawyer and People magazine: Her father left when she was 3; her mother remarried; her older brother, who she described as her best friend, ran away from home when she was 12; she then ran away when she was 17. She became a high school dropout. A life of drugs, alcohol and heavy partying followed. She was raped. Visions of music stardom danced in her head. Music groupie led to high paid ""escort"". But let's call it what it is simply.... prostitution.  Watch Hostin on why Spitzer shouldn't have gotten a pass » . But Spitzer doesn't have to be careful, because he got a pass. A complete pass. He even got to keep his law license, the same one he used relentlessly and mercilessly when he went after wrongdoers. So the question I have is why? Why did the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York, the very same office that zealously went after Martha Stewart for lying to some of its prosecutors, give him a complete pass, a proverbial get-out-of-jail free card? U.S. Attorney Michael Garcia explained there was no evidence that campaign or public funds were used. Of course there wasn't evidence of that, Mr. Garcia -- Spitzer is rich. The U.S. Attorney also claimed that his office had also determined there was ""insufficient evidence to bring charges against Mr. Spitzer for any offense relating to the withdrawal of funds for, and his payments to, the Emperors Club VIP...."" Really? Since it seems to me (and many other lawyers I have spoken with) that there was evidence that Spitzer violated the Mann Act, which makes it a federal criminal offense to knowingly transport any individual, male or female, across state lines for the purpose of prostitution or sexual activity. The indictment made it clear that Client No. 9 met Kristin, who was based in New York but traveled to Washington, at the Mayflower Hotel, Room 871 to be exact, ""for her tryst."" It was also alleged that Client No. 9 paid for Kristin's train tickets, cab fare, mini-bar and room service, travel time and hotel. In the way Spitzer paid for her services, it appears that there was also evidence of ""structuring,"" a crime which involves creating a series of financial movements designed to obscure the true purpose of the payments. Prosecutors reportedly had a series of e-mails and wiretapped phone conversations of Spitzer, in addition to financial records. Sounds like good evidence of criminal activity to me. But Garcia finally admitted what was behind his office's decision not to prosecute Spitzer when he said ""[i]n light of the policy of the Department of Justice with respect to prostitution offenses and the longstanding practice of this office, as well as Mr. Spitzer's acceptance of responsibility for his conduct, we have concluded that the public interest would not be further advanced by filing criminal charges in this matter."" The policy he referred to is that prosecutors don't go after ""johns"" or ""customers"". But why not? What better way to cripple a business than to cut out its customers? Just look at the state of our economy -- when people aren't buying, businesses are in trouble. Pure and simple. Prostitution is not a victimless crime. Look at Ashley, really look at her. She really looks like every other prostitute -- a victim of her upbringing, a victim of her circumstance and now a victim of the government's policy. So there you have it. You can't lie to a federal prosecutor, but if you wire your own money to the accounts of an international prostitution ring, and arrange to have paid sex in the nation's capital, it's all good. You see, Martha. You should have paid for sex in Washington.

"(CNN) -- Time waits for no man -- not even Tiger Woods. The man who dazzled the world of golf by accumulating 14 majors by the age of 32 has now gone five seasons without a single one. Every January he is asked if this will be the year he gets back on the trail to catch Jack Nicklaus' record haul of 18 -- every year he says he's determined to. But 2014 could hold particular resonance for him, as three of the season's four majors are at venues where he has won before. And as he prepares for his first event on the PGA Tour -- a defense of his Farmers Insurance Open crown -- the world No. 1 has acknowledged he's had to mold his game as the years have gone by. ""I view it as every year's a big year,"" 38-year-old Woods told a press conference. ""Every year that I get a chance to compete and play in tournaments and major championships for as long as I decide to do it, every year's a big year, every year counts. ""Looking back from the beginning of my career to now, I know that I don't have 20 years in my prime. ""I don't see being 58 and being in my prime. Most guys don't jump from the foul line at age 58, so it's a little different but the outlook is still the same. ""I still prepare the same, I still work my tail off to be ready to compete at this level and beat everything that I'm playing against."" Woods won five PGA Tour titles in 2013 -- the tenth time in his illustrious career that he's done so. It took him to a total haul of 79 titles. That performance was enough to see Woods crowned the Tour's 2013 Player of the Year, even though he failed to seriously threaten any major titles -- tied fourth his best showing at the Masters. And while his game is still in good enough shape to be way out in front at the top of the world rankings, Woods says it is, inevitably, less powerful than it used to be. ""I'm still able to generate the same amount of club head speed as I did when I was younger, it's just that I can't do it every shot anymore,"" Woods said. ""I don't have the rotational speed that I used to and that's a fact of aging. I would think that as you get older your skills would start to decline. ""What's happened is when I started working with (Dave) Pelz in 2004 on certain things with distance control, iron work, wedge work, putting and so forth, it's all getting better now each year the more I'm able to work on it, the more I'm able to practice."" If Woods needed a reminder of where his game used to be in the majors, he will get it this season. He's triumphed four times at Augusta, scene of the year's first major -- The Masters -- and finished both second and third at Pinehurst, scene of this season's U.S. Open. The British Open returns to Royal Liverpool -- where Woods won in 2006 -- before the final major of the season, the PGA Championship, is staged at Valhalla in Kentucky, where Woods took the title in 2000. With the 40-mark less than two years away, many commentators think these next two seasons will be vital for Woods. The player himself referenced another American sporting great -- legendary basketball star Michael Jordan -- as an example of someone who'd been able to adapt his game as he got older. ""When you look at (Michael Jordan) when he first came out, he was able to dunk over everybody, but he got beat up by the Pistons three straight playoffs, he was out and next thing you know he built up his body and developed a fadeaway,"" Woods said. ""So you do it a different way. You evolve as you age and I think I've done that so far.""","World No. 1 Tiger Woods admits he's had to adapt his game the older he gets .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Katherine Jackson doesn't celebrate Mother's Day or birthdays for religious reasons. But Michael Jackson's mother, who turns 81 on May 4, said she does believe in the tradition of sending flowers to a loved one. ""It means love, 'I was thinking about you today, so I'm sending you these flowers,' "" Jackson said. ""Sometimes when you might be feeling down and you get some flowers, it perks you up."" Jackson, who rarely gives interviews, spoke to CNN about the Katherine Jackson Flower Collection, which launches Tuesday on SendHerFlowers.com, just in time for Mother's Day. ""Flowers make me feel happy,"" she said. While Jackson was eager to talk about flowers -- her favorites are red and yellow roses -- she was reluctant to speak on the record about what has made her feel sad lately. Perhaps she would have the strength later to talk about her differences with the men who now control her late son's estate or the upcoming trial of the doctor charged in his death, but not yet, Jackson said. She dreads sitting in court for Dr. Conrad Murray's involuntary manslaughter trial, which is set to last two months starting May 9, she said. But she will be there, listening to testimony about how her son died. The judge has already ruled that prosecutors can show photographs from his autopsy. ""A mother's job is never done,"" Jackson said. With the camera turned off, her frustration with the news media's coverage of the singer's life and death and of her family emerged. For example, Katherine and Joe Jackson have sometimes been described as estranged. But after 61 years of marriage, they are still a couple in love, she said. Her husband spends most of his time at the Las Vegas home given to them by daughter Janet Jackson, but it's not unusual for her to drive across the desert to spend a few days with her husband. Joe Jackson often travels to Los Angeles to stay with his wife. They sit together in court, sometimes holding hands. She recently moved from the Encino mansion that was the Jackson family home for four decades and into a newly built mansion on a hilltop in Calabasas. Although the Hayvenhurst home is being remodeled, she hinted that she's not moving back. With the camera turned back on, Jackson, who raised nine children and is now caring for Michael Jackson's three children, shared advice about motherhood. She called it ""the most important thing in the world."" ""One thing about mothers -- they have to really be there for their children when they need her,"" she said. ""They should be there at all times and know where your children are at all times. You must make your 'yes' mean 'yes' and let your 'no' mean 'no.' That's really the way to bring your children up."" It's the mother who holds the family together, she said. ""Yes, she's the glue that keeps the family going,"" Jackson said.","""A mother's job is never done,"" Katherine Jackson says .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Michael Jackson's doctor will face trial on an involuntary manslaughter charge in the death of the pop superstar, a Los Angeles judge ruled Tuesday. Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Michael Pastor also prohibited Dr. Conrad Murray from using his California medical license until the trial is completed. The state medical board requested that be made a provision of his bail. While Jackson was Murray's only and last California patient, Murray's lawyer argued a suspension in one state would prompt Texas and Nevada, where he sees patients, to also take action. Pastor denied the prosecution's request to increase Murray's bail, which is now set at $75,000. ""Michael is not with us today because of an utterly inept, incompetent, reckless doctor, the defendant Conrad Murray,"" Los Angeles County Deputy District Attorney David Walgren said in his final arguments. Several Jackson's family members sat through the six-day preliminary hearing for Murray, but they would not talk about the ruling as they left court Tuesday. The lawyer for Michael Jackson's estate issued a statement on behalf of the co-executors. ""The judge's ruling ordering Dr. Murray to stand trial for the death of Michael Jackson is perfectly appropriate given the testimony in this case,"" Howard Weitzman said. Murray's lawyers appeared satisfied with the results of the preliminary hearing because of testimony they got from prosecution witnesses that might help raise reasonable doubt about Murray's guilt at trial. ""I think the prosecution is going to change their tactics in this case,"" defense lawyer J. Michael Flanagan said after court. ""It's not the same as what they gave in opening statements."" Earlier Tuesday, the prosecution's expert witness in the case admitted he made a math mistake and that the recalculation supports the defense theory that Michael Jackson may have given himself the fatal dose of propofol. Propofol is a surgical anesthetic that the Los Angeles coroner ruled killed Jackson in combination with several sedatives found in his blood. Dr. Richard Ruffalo, an anesthesiologist hired by the prosecution, was the last witness to take the stand. ""I actually made a mistake on that,"" Ruffalo said during cross-examination, referring to his calculation of the levels of propofol in Jackson's stomach fluid. The admission drew an audible gasp from Jackson family members sitting in court. Murray's lawyers suggest a frustrated and sleepless Jackson may have poured the surgical anesthetic propofol into his juice bottle while the doctor was out of his bedroom. ""Now it doesn't make sense unless he ingested it orally in a huge amount,"" Ruffalo testified. But he said Murray would still be at fault, because he left dangerous drugs near a patient who was addicted. ""It's like leaving a syringe next to a heroin addict,"" Ruffalo said. ""If he's not getting what he wants, when you leave the room he might reach for it himself."" ""Either way, it doesn't matter,"" he testified. ""He abandoned his patient and didn't resuscitate appropriately."" Murray should have anticipated that Jackson, who had previously asked to inject himself, might do this, Ruffalo said. ""He gets upset if he doesn't get his milk,"" he said, referring to Jackson's habit of referring to propofol as his ""milk."" The pop star's sister La Toya Jackson was clearly upset by hearing a prosecution witness vilify her brother as an addict. The pathologist who conducted Jackson's autopsy acknowledged earlier Tuesday it was possible, although improbable, that Jackson gave himself the fatal dose of the propofol. The defense planted the seed Monday for its theory that Jackson may have given himself the fatal dose. A doctor said in a police interview two days after the death that a sleepless Jackson begged Murray for propofol the day he died, a police detective testified. While Murray told police he eventually gave Jackson propofol, the defense lawyer suggested that it could be that a frustrated Jackson poured the fatal dosage into his juice and drank it. Jackson had depended on propofol to put him to sleep almost every night in the previous weeks as he was preparing for his ""This Is It"" comeback concerts, but Murray began to wean him off the surgical anesthetic two nights earlier, Murray told police. Los Angeles Police Detective Orlando Martinez testified at the preliminary hearing about what the doctor told him two days after Jackson's death. Several doses of two sedatives Murray used in place of propofol still hadn't put Jackson to sleep after several hours on the morning of June 25, 2009, Murray said, according to Martinez. ""Mr. Jackson began to complain that he couldn't sleep and that he would have to cancel his rehearsal and cancel his shows if he couldn't get any sleep since he couldn't perform,"" Martinez quoted Murray as saying. A civil lawsuit filed last year by Jackson's mother against the company producing the concerts alleged that he had been warned a week earlier ""that if Jackson missed any further rehearsals, they were going to 'pull the plug' on the show."" Murray said he eventually gave in to the pressure from his patient and administered a dose of propofol about 10 a.m., the detective testified. Jackson finally fell asleep, according to Murray's account. While his patient slept, Murray sent an e-mail to a British insurance agent assuring him that Jackson was in good health, according to another witness Monday.","Defense attorneys comment on hearing .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Organizers of a Michael Jackson tribute concert, supported by the late pop star's mother and four siblings, promise they will announce ""an incredible line-up very soon"" that will include ""some of the greatest names in music."" Promoters missed their deadline of Thursday to name the performers for the October 8 show, forcing them to put registration for tickets to the Cardiff, Wales, concert on hold. ""The registration period was put on hold because we want people to know who they are registering to see,"" Chris Hunt, the head of the British company promoting the concert, said in a message posted online Friday. The plan had been to announce the acts over a 10-day period following the July 25 news conference in which Jackson brothers Marlon, Tito and Jackie, sister La Toya and family matriarch Katherine Jackson endorsed the ""Michael Forever: The Tribute Concert."" The Global Live Events chief promised fans Friday the process would get on track. ""Between now and October we will be continuing to add names to the line-up so more announcements will follow,"" Hunt said. ""Fans of Michael's music will get the concert they've been waiting for."" ""Some of the greatest names in music are already signed, and more are trying to shuffle other commitments to come on board,"" a statement posted Friday on the concert website said. Plans for the show appeared to be in disarray Thursday when tickets were to go on sale, but instead of providing a link for purchases the promoter's website asked fans to ""Please Standby for further announcements."" The problems started soon after the family announced the ""Michael Forever: The Tribute Concert"" at the Beverly Hills Hotel on July 25. La Toya Jackson said it was ""something that's spectacular"" while the Jacksons' mother called it ""a show fit for a king."" ""If my son were here today, he would feel the same way,"" Katherine Jackson said. ""I know my brother would be very, very proud to see all the artists that he admired and respected so much coming together for this event,"" Tito Jackson said. But an hour later, Jermaine and Randy Jackson, the only brothers not at the news conference, issued a sharply worded statement that reflected a deep division within the Jackson family over the show. ""We want to make clear that this does not reflect the position of the entire family,"" the two brothers said in a joint statement. ""While we wholeheartedly support the spirit of a tribute that honors our brother, we find it impossible to support an event that is due to take place during the criminal trial surrounding Michael's death."" The involuntary manslaughter trial of Michael Jackson's physician, Dr. Conrad Murray, begins in September and is expected to continue into October. While Hunt had hinted it could include a Jackson brothers reunion, the statement from Jermaine and Randy Jackson made it clear that would not happen. ""In light of this, we feel it is inappropriate to be involved with such an ill-timed event and its promoter, Global Live,"" Randy and Jermaine Jackson said. Their statement said the idea of the October concert was presented to the entire family in April ""as an idea already in its advanced stages."" The decision to go ahead with it ""disrespects opinions and wishes expressed in the strongest terms"" by some members of the Jackson family, they said. The Michael Jackson Fan Club agreed with the two brothers, issuing a similar statement. ""We share their concerns that this concert is taking place at a most inappropriate time when everyone's care and attention should be focused on the matter of justice. We believe that, as stated by Jermaine and Randy, the most important tribute we can give to Michael Jackson at this time is to seek justice in his name."" Jackson fans posted messages on the concert's Facebook page questioning ticket prices and the process for buying them. Fans must place bids for a chance to buy a ticket. The higher their pledge to a charity, the better their chances of getting a good seat. ""The ticket system is so bad!! the higher you bid the better seats you get?? not every Michael fan is rich!!!"" one fan posted on the ""Michael Forever Tribute"" Facebook page Thursday. The October 8 show, in the Wales Millennium Centre in Cardiff, which seats 75,000 people, would be at least four hours long, Hunt said. In addition to the other problems surrounding the event, a spokesman for Michael Jackson's estate said last week that the promoters never sought or obtained permission from the estate's executors to use late pop singer's name or image. ""The estate has not been contacted and is not involved with Global Live Events in the UK tribute concert announced today,"" spokesman Jim Bates told CNN.","""Fans of Michael's music will get the concert they've been waiting for,"" promoter says .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- The trial of Michael Jackson's doctor reached another emotional peak Wednesday as jurors heard a recording of Jackson, using slow and slurred speech, telling Dr. Conrad Murray, ""I hurt, you know, I hurt."" A photograph of Jackson lying dead on a hospital gurney was later projected onto a large screen in the courtroom, a vivid reminder to jurors of why they will listen to a least a month of testimony in Dr. Murray's involuntary manslaughter trial. While the court camera feed focused on the disturbing image for just five seconds -- the result of a earlier decision to minimize public exposure to such shocking images -- it was displayed on a large screen in front of the jury for about two minutes. Forensic computer expert Stephen Marx, who found the audio file on Murray's iPhone, said it was recorded on May 10, 2009, when Jackson was preparing for his ""This Is It"" concerts set for London two months later. Prosecutors, who played a clip of the stunning audio in their opening statement last week, let the jury hear the entire recording in Murray's involuntary manslaughter trial Wednesday. ""Elvis didn't do it. Beatles didn't do it. We have to be phenomenal,"" Jackson said. ""When people leave this show, when people leave my show, I want them to say, 'I've never seen nothing like this in my life. Go. Go. I've never seen nothing like this. Go. It's amazing. He's the greatest entertainer in the world.' I'm taking that money, a million children, children's hospital, the biggest in the world, Michael Jackson Children's Hospital. Going to have a movie theater, game room."" In the portion never before heard in court, Jackson talked about his life and concern for children: . ""Children are depressed. The -- in those hospitals, no game room, no movie theater. They're sick because they're depressed. Their mind is depressing them. I want to give them that. I care about them, them angels. God wants me to do it. God wants me to do it. I'm going to do it, Conrad."" Another voice, which the prosecutor said was Murray's, is heard saying, ""I know you would."" ""Don't have enough hope, no more hope,"" Jackson said. ""That's the next generation that's going to save our planet, starting with -- we'll talk about it. United States, Europe, Prague, my babies. They walk around with no mother. They drop them off, they leave -- a psychological degradation of that. They reach out to me: 'Please take me with you.'"" At the end, Jackson said he was ""going to do that for them."" ""That will be remembered more than my performances. My performances will be up there helping my children and always be my dream. I love them. I love them because I didn't have a childhood. I had no childhood. I feel their pain. I feel their hurt. I can deal with it. 'Heal the World,' 'We Are the World,' 'Will You Be There,' 'The Lost Children.' These are the songs I've written because I hurt, you know, I hurt."" His brother Jermaine Jackson wiped tears from his eyes as he listened in court. Deputy District Attorney David Walgren said in his opening statement that Jackson was ""highly under the influences of unknown agents"" when Murray recorded Jackson. Another recording found on Murray's phone and played in court Wednesday was a voice mail from Frank Dileo, who was Jackson's last manager. Dileo's message to Murray, left five days before Jackson's death, suggested that he ""get a blood test"" from Jackson because ""we've got to see what he's doing."" He referred to ""an episode"" Jackson had at a rehearsal the night before. ""He's sick,"" Dileo said. Concert producer Kenny Ortega testified about Jackson's illness in the first day of the trial, which he wrote about in an e-mail sent about the same time Dileo was leaving his phone message. ""He appeared quite weak and fatigued this evening,"" Ortega wrote. ""He had a terrible case of the chills, was trembling, rambling and obsessing. Everything in me says he should be psychologically evaluated."" Jurors should also soon hear the full recording of Murray's interview with Los Angeles police two days after Jackson's death. Murray's iPhone also contained e-mail attachments that appeared to be Jackson's medical records sent by Murray's office assistant to the doctor, who was gathering them for a British insurance agent who was arranging cancellation insurance for Jackson's London concerts. The insurers were concerned about news reports that Jackson was seen ""at various times using a wheelchair"" and that he suffered a back injury, lupus, emphysema and cancer, according to an e-mail from the agent to the doctor. Jackson refused to authorize the release of his medical records to the insurance company, Murray wrote back, but he added concerning the news reports of illnesses ""let me say they're all fallacious to the best of my knowledge."" One record shown in court, kept under the alias ""Omar Arnold,"" indicated that in September 2008, Murray diagnosed Jackson with insomnia and anxiety. Files from the phone suggest Murray was dealing with the insurance agent's request around the same time he said he was struggling to help Jackson go to sleep with sedatives. The prosecution wants to show jurors that Murray was distracted by a long list of phone calls and e-mails, causing him to neglect Jackson, who stopped breathing and died. Los Angeles County Coroner's investigator Elissa Fleak testified Wednesday afternoon, showing jurors what she collected from Jackson's bedroom. Fleak identified a saline bag that was cut open and an empty 100 ml propofol bottle inside. The prosecution alleges Murray used it as a makeshift IV drip to administer propofol to Jackson. The defense contends Murray gave Jackson just 25 ml of the drug and used a syringe to push it in. Twelve bottles of the surgical anesthetic propofol were found in the bedroom during her first search the day Jackson died, including an empty vial found on the floor next to the bed, Fleak said. Seven bottles of medications were on a nightstand next to the bed, including one with lorazepam pills prescribed by Murray to Jackson. Murray's defense lawyers say Jackson caused his own death by swallowing eight lorazepam pills and orally ingesting propofol while Murray was out of the room. The coroner ruled that Jackson's death on June 25, 2009, was the result of ""acute propofol intoxication"" in combination with sedatives. Prosecutors argue that Murray, who was Jackson's personal doctor as he prepared for planned comeback concerts, is criminally responsible for the singer's death because of medical negligence and his reckless use of the propofol to help Jackson sleep. Earlier Wednesday, a medical supply sales representative testified that a Murray assistant ""raised a red flag"" by asking that she ship an infusion IV set to a California residence, not his clinic. Seacoast Medical rep Sally Hirschberg testified that she refused the request and instead sent the supplies, which were apparently recovered from Jackson's bedroom by investigators, to one of Murray's clinics. Murray trial: No fist fights here . Tuesday's testimony by the trio of Murray's girlfriends also delivered drama. Cocktail waitress Sade Anding, who dated Murray after they met at a Houston steakhouse where she worked, described a phone call from Murray that prosecutors suggest is evidence of when the doctor realized there was a problem with Jackson. Five or six minutes into the call, which began at 11:51 a.m. the day Jackson died, Anding realized that Murray was not listening to her. ""I said 'Hello, hello, are you there?' "" Anding testified. She said that when she pressed her cell phone against her ear, ""I heard the mumbling of voices ... and I heard coughing, and nobody answered."" Anding hung up the phone about three minutes later, she said. The interruption, which prosecutors said was probably when Murray noticed his patient was not breathing, would have come around 11:57 a.m., about 10 minutes before the time chef Kai Chase said Murray ran down the stairs to ask her to call for help. The prosecution says that one reason Murray is criminally responsible for Jackson's death is because phone calls and text messages to these women, other patients and employees at his clinics caused him to ignore his patient while administering dangerous drugs. Nicole Alvarez, 29, who has a 2-year-old son fathered by Murray, delivered animated testimony Tuesday that suggested she was starstruck by Michael Jackson, whom she met several times with Murray. ""I was speechless when I met him,"" Alvarez testified. ""I couldn't believe I was meeting Michael Jackson."" Her testimony was important because it was her apartment where a Las Vegas pharmacy shipped 255 bottles of propofol -- totaling more than four gallons -- and 80 bottles of liquid sedatives that prosecutors say Murray ordered for Jackson. The prosecution also asked her about a phone call Murray placed to her from the ambulance while on the way to the hospital with Jackson. ""I remember him telling me that he was on the way to the hospital in the ambulance with Mr. Jackson and for me not to be alarmed,"" Alvarez said. ""He didn't want me to be worried, because he knew I would learn this through the news."" On Monday, the emergency room doctor who declared Jackson dead testified that there was no way doctors could have revived the pop icon after he arrived at the hospital. If convicted of involuntary manslaughter, Murray could spend four years in a California prison and lose his medical license.","NEW: Photo of Michael Jackson's body on gurney shown to jury .

"Editor's note: This story was originally published on CNN in August 2013. We're bringing it back so you can protect yourself at the pool and beach this summer. Happy ""Don't Fry Day!"" (Health.com) -- Unless you've been living under a rock, you know to apply sunscreen. There's lifesaving reason to: About 3.5 million cases of skin cancer will be diagnosed this year. ""The incidence of skin cancer, including melanoma -- the deadliest kind -- is going up, and wearing sunscreen is one of the best ways to prevent it,"" says Dr. Ronald Moy, a dermatologist and spokesperson for the Skin Cancer Foundation. Stick with these smart tips to make sure you're as protected as you can possibly be. Select a sunscreen you love . Finding your sunscreen soul-mate is the key motivating factor for using it regularly, experts agree. ""If you think your sunscreen is pasty, thick or smelly, you have the wrong kind,"" says Dr. Jeffrey Dover, clinical associate professor of dermatology at Yale University. ""It may make you less likely to put it on, or to reapply when you do."" Happily, there are plenty of lightweight, sheer formulas on the market. Health.com: Which sunscreen is best for you? Remember, SPF 30 is the new 15 . As a general rule, SPF 15 blocks 93% of UVB rays, SPF 30 blocks 97% and SPF 50 blocks 98%. Doctors now typically recommend at least SPF 30 -- at least being the key words. If you have a family history of skin cancer or are vacationing in a tropical spot (where the sun is especially intense), go for 50 or even 70. Just keep in mind: No sunscreen provides 100% protection. So to be safe as possible, you still need to reapply every two hours and after a swim, even if you used the water-resistant kind, says Dr. Joshua Zeichner, director of cosmetic and clinical research in dermatology at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York City. FYI, sunscreen becomes less effective about three years after you open the container. Health.com: Is it a mole...or skin cancer? Check labels for the term broad-spectrum . It means the sunscreen provides protection against both UVA (wrinkle- and cancer-causing) and UVB (burning) rays. Problem is, that labeling rule only went into effect in December and stores still sell inventory made prior to it, notes Dr. Steven Wang, director of dermatologic surgery and dermatology at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in Basking Ridge, New Jersey. So if you're shopping and there's no broad-spectrum mention, check the ingredients for zinc or avobenzone, the only two that provide top-notch UVA coverage, he says. Health.com: 7 ways you're aging your skin . Layer it on . Think you apply enough? Almost no one does. ""Several big studies show that most people rub in only about a fourth of what's needed to reach the labeled SPF -- it's faster and easier to put on just a bit,"" notes Dover. Instead of that old advice to use a shot glass-size dose, all our experts recommend applying two coats. Squeeze a line of lotion down your arms and legs and rub in, then do it again. Ditto for spray formulas: hold the nozzle close to your skin and spray, moving slowly up and down until you see a sheen, then go back over the area. For your face, apply a pea-size drop to each cheek, your forehead and your chin, then smear in. Repeat! Health.com: Sun-proof your skin from a to z . Don't forget your nose . It's the number one sunburn-spot, dermatologists say. ""People apply sunscreen to their face, but either skip or speed over their nose -- especially if they wear glasses, because they don't want to take them off,"" Wang says. Moy adds, ""80% of the skin cancers I remove are on the nose."" Other commonly missed areas include the feet, hair part, ears and chest, as well as the backs of hands and legs. Use a sunscreen stick to spot-apply. Get antioxidant insurance . Since rays can still get through sunscreen, companies are now including antioxidants such as vitamins C and E and green tea to help mitigate damage. If you don't want to bother applying a serum that contains them beneath your moisturizer or sunscreen (Wang's first choice), try a souped-up SPF pick. Realize that sunscreen is only one part of a sun-smart plan . ""The hierarchy of sun protection should be avoidance first, then seek shade and wear a wide-brim hat and protective clothing, then use sunscreen -- but most people have that sequence backward,"" Wang points out. Consider hitting the beach or pool in the morning instead of midday (when sun is strongest), and bring an umbrella and a tightly woven long-sleeve shirt. Know that it's never too late to start safe habits . So you baked in the sun as a teen with little or no sunscreen. While regular tanning or getting several bad burns when you're young raises your risk of skin cancer, Moy says, what's critical is that you put on sunscreen these days. ""Since skin's ability to repair itself decreases with age, your risk is even greater if you burn now."" Good thing you're using it! Photos: Your worst sunburns ever .

"(CNN) -- In a decision that sidesteps a major shift in labor policy, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled Monday that Illinois can't force home health care workers to pay dues to unions. The narrow 5-4 ruling applies most directly to the Illinois home care providers who challenged a state decision to classify them as public employees and require them to pay fees to a union. But it also deals a blow to union efforts nationwide to extend their reach in an era of declining membership and political influence. ""These home workers share a lot of attributes of the new emerging work force, and for unions, it's a big blow because that was their growth area,"" George Washington University Law School professor Jonathan Turley said. ""And it's going to be very difficult now to extend these contracts to get those types of dues."" Still, the ruling was not as broad as many union activists had feared, falling well short of what some had predicted would be a vote to gut a 37-year-old Supreme Court decision allowing for what's known in labor circles as the agency shop system. Read the ruling (PDF) Instead, the court created a new category of ""partial public employees"" who can't be compelled to pay into the union system. ""A narrow decision, a loss for the unions but not as catastrophic as many labor union people had feared,"" said CNN legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin. The ruling stems from a decision by Illinois lawmakers to classify home health care workers paid by Medicaid as state employees and require them to pay fees to the Service Employees International Union. The union exclusively bargains with the state over wages, hours and working conditions. The employees, most of whom were hired by individual patients and reimbursed through Medicaid, argued that they were being forced to subsidize the union's efforts in violation of constitutional rights of free speech and free association. State officials argued that mandatory union representation increased wages and benefits, reduced employee turnover and improved training and supervision. Justice Samuel Alito, writing for the conservative majority, said the practice was a clear violation of the First Amendment. ""If we accepted Illinois' argument, we would approve an unprecedented violation of the bedrock principle that, except perhaps in the rarest of circumstances, no person in this country may be compelled to subsidize speech by a third party that he or she does not wish to support,"" Alito wrote. Justice Elena Kagan wrote in her dissent that in terms of the 1977 ruling that allowed agency shops, there was no difference between the home health workers and more traditional state employees. Labor union allies picked up on that line of reasoning. ""The Supreme Court's ruling is a serious concern for workers' rights across the country -- employees whose job qualifications, evaluations, salaries, work hours, training, and wages are all controlled by the state are, in every sense of the word, public sector employees,"" Rea Carey, executive director of the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force, said in a statement. ""Failure to recognize this fact, and to provide the collective bargaining rights that go along with it, will harm workers and families across the country,"" Carey said. The union involved in the case, the Service Employees International Union, said in a statement that the ruling ""places at risk a system of consumer-directed home care in Illinois that has proven successful in raising wages, providing affordable health care benefits, and increasing training."" But union President Mary Kay Henry said the effort to unionize workers would continue. ""No court case is going to stand in the way of home care workers coming together to have a strong voice for good jobs and quality home care,"" she said. Fordham University law professor James Brudney said the ruling ""strikes a blow against efforts to address the serious problem of income inequality in this country."" ""Home care employees are among our lowest-paid workers, and this decision will make it harder for them to come together to improve conditions."" The conservative Competitive Enterprise Institute, however, celebrated the ruling as a major victory. ""This decision delivers a major blow to the coercive powers of government unions,"" institute policy analyst Trey Kovacs said in a statement. ""The ruling frees thousands of home care and child care providers from financially assisting government unions that they disagree with."" CNN's Michael Pearson reported and wrote from Atlanta; Bill Mears reported and wrote from Washington.","NEW: Illinois practice is clear First Amendment violation, Justice Samuel Alito writes .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Evidence intended to prove Michael Jackson could not have caused his own death might not be allowed in the involuntary manslaughter trial of Dr. Conrad Murray, the judge said Wednesday. A California appeals court on Wednesday denied Murray's petition for a stay in his trial so that the issue of jury sequestration could be reconsidered, a defense lawyer said. The denial cleared the way for jury selection to start Thursday. Murray's defense is built on the theory that Jackson drank propofol, the surgical anesthetic the coroner concluded killed him, while the doctor was away from his bedside on the morning of June 25, 2009. Prosecutors want jurors to hear expert testimony based on a recent experiment conducted on six university students in Chile they argue proves there is ""zero possibility that the propofol was orally ingested."" Judge warns Murray to keep quiet about his rulings . Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Michael Pastor raised questions about the experiment in a hearing Wednesday. ""I need more information about the underlying data since it is not a scientific published article,"" Pastor said. ""I don't know the source of the information."" The judge will allow a prosecution expert to testify about a study on piglets conducted at a veterinary college in Norway, a report defense attorneys argued has nothing to do with how oral ingestion of propofol would affect a human. The study involved five piglets that ""have propofol suppositories shoved up their rectums and they are watched to see if they went to sleep,"" defense attorney Michael Flanagan said. ""The rectum is at the other end of the (gastrointestinal) system."" Murray, who was hired as Jackson's personal physician as the singer rehearsed for comeback concerts, is charged with involuntary manslaughter. Prosecutors contend Murray used a makeshift IV drip to administer propofol intended to help Jackson sleep, a practice they argue violated the standard of care and led to the pop icon's death. Jury selection for the trial is set to start Thursday morning when about 160 potential jurors gather in the downtown Los Angeles courthouse to fill out questionnaires to determine if they are qualified to hear the case. Opening statements in the trial, which will be televised, are expected to be delivered on September 27.","NEW: Appeals court denies the defense petition for a delay in the trial's start .

"(CNN) -- The morning the Deepwater Horizon oil rig exploded, a BP executive and a Transocean official argued over how to proceed with the drilling, rig survivors told CNN's Anderson Cooper in an exclusive interview. The survivors' account paints perhaps the most detailed picture yet of what happened on the deepwater rig -- and the possible causes of the April 20 explosion. The BP official wanted workers to replace heavy mud, used to keep the well's pressure down, with lighter seawater to help speed a process that was costing an estimated $750,000 a day and was already running five weeks late, rig survivors told CNN. BP won the argument, said Doug Brown, the rig's chief mechanic. ""He basically said, 'Well, this is how it's gonna be.' "" ""That's what the big argument was about,"" added Daniel Barron III. Shortly after the exchange, chief driller Dewey Revette expressed concern and opposition too, the workers said, and on the drilling floor, they chatted among themselves. ""I don't ever remember doing this,"" they said, according to Barron. ""I think that's why Dewey was so reluctant to try to do it,"" Barron said, ""because he didn't feel it was the right way to have things done."" Revette was among the 11 workers killed when the rig exploded that night. In the CNN interviews, the workers described a corporate culture of cutting staff and ignoring warning signs ahead of the blast. They said BP routinely cut corners and pushed ahead despite concerns about safety. The rig survivors also said it was always understood that you could get fired if you raised safety concerns that might delay drilling. Some co-workers had been fired for speaking out, they said. It can cost up to $1 million a day to operate a deepwater rig, according to industry experts. Safety was ""almost used as a crutch by the company,"" Barron said. He said he was once scolded for standing on a bucket on the rig, yet the next day, Transocean ordered a crane to continue operating amid high winds, against its own policies. ""It's like they used it against us -- the safety policies -- you know, to their advantage. ""I don't think there was ever a plan set in place, because no one ever thought this was gonna ever happen,"" he added. BP spokesman Robert Wine would not comment on specific allegations, saying the company has to ""wait for the investigations to be completed. We can't prejudge them."" ""BP's priority is always safety,"" he said. Transocean, the world's largest offshore drilling contractor, said its top priority is safety. ""There is no scenario or circumstance under which it will be compromised,"" the company said in a written statement. ""So critical is safety at Transocean that every crew member has stop-work authority, a real-time method by which all work is halted should any employee suspect an unsafe situation or operation."" In Washington on Tuesday, Rep. Nick Rahall, the chairman of the House Natural Resources Committee, sought more answers. In a letter to Steven Newman, CEO of Transocean, Rahall said records from the rig indicate 18 people at work on the second shift  with ""zero engineers, electricians, mechanics or subsea supervisors"" on duty the night of the explosion. Rahall added that payroll records show 20 crewmen, including seven of the 11 men who died, had worked a 24-hour shift six days before the explosion. Rig workers typically work 12-hour days. ""Although these reports do not provide a complete picture of who exactly was working during the time of the explosion and in the days leading up to it, when combined with the ongoing BP internal investigation that suggests that inattentiveness may have been a contributing factor in the disaster, I have serious questions about whether enough people were working on the night of April 20 to adequately handle the complex operations that were being performed, or if crew fatigue caused by extended shifts may have played a role,"" wrote Rahall, D-West Virginia, the chairman of the House Natural Resources Committee. Rahall called on the company to give his committee more detailed logs and a further explanation of its staffing -- a request Transocean said it would meet. But Transocean said no worker put in a 24-hour day, and the documents Rahall cited didn't tell the whole picture. Daily drilling reports track operations and ""certain personnel,"" it said, ""but does not use them to catalog complete crew shifts or the actual hours worked by each crewmember."" ""At the time of the accident, the Deepwater Horizon and its crew had compiled seven consecutive years of operations without a single lost-time safety incident,"" the company said in a written statement. ""The vessel was properly and professionally manned; there was no shortage of technical expertise, nor did any crewmember work a 24-hour shift."" CNN was given access to individual time sheets that appear to back up Transocean's claim that no employees worked 24-hour shifts on April 14, six days before the explosion that eventually sank the rig. Other documents reviewed by CNN seem to indicate that additional salaried workers may have been on the job that don't show up on time sheets, possibly refuting the committee's claim the rig was shortstaffed on April 20. The rig workers have filed a negligence suit against BP, Transocean, oil field services contractor Halliburton and other companies involved with the deepwater rig. ""I've seen gross negligence, and this conduct is criminal,"" said Steve Gordon, the lawyer representing the men. ""There's a crime scene sitting 5,000 feet below the water."" Brown, the rig's mechanic, had traveled with the rig from South Korea, where it was made nearly a decade ago. He had seen the mechanical crew get downsized over the years. Yet as the rig aged, the engines began having more problems. ""It became overwhelming,"" he said. ""We couldn't keep up with the flow of it. ... We constantly over the years kept telling them, 'Hey, we need more help back here.' ""They pretty much just said, 'Well, we'll look into it.' "" About nine months ago, Brown said, he got an additional first engineer, yet the crew was still overloaded with work. Even more alarming, the rig survivors said, was the amount of resistance the well was giving them. ""We had problems with it from the day we got on,"" Matthew Jacobs said. Nearly every day, Jacobs said, ""we had problems with that well."" Barron said it was like an eerie cloud hung over the well being dug 5,000 feet into the sea. ""There was always like an ominous feeling,"" he said. ""This well did not want to be drilled. ... It just seemed like we were messing with Mother Nature."" At times, the drill got stuck. Many times, it ""kicked,"" meaning gas was shooting back through the mud at an alarming rate. ""I've seen a lot of gas coming up from muds on different wells, and the highest I've ever seen in my 11 years was 1,500 units. And this well gave us 3,000,"" Brown said. ""I've never been on a well with that high of gas coming out of the mud. That was kind of letting me know this well was something to be reckoned with."" It all came to a head at 9:56 p.m., when the first of three explosions rocked Deepwater Horizon, 52 miles southeast of Venice, Louisiana, with 126 people aboard. Tiles fell from the ceiling, walls collapsed, and people ran for their lives. It reminded Matt Jacobs of the movie ""Titanic."" ""It looked like you was looking at the face of death,"" he said. ""You could hear it, see it, smell it."" He scrambled to the lifeboat deck. Jacobs had been trained to fight fires aboard the rig. But when he looked at the flames shooting 150 feet into the air, he knew there was nothing they could do. ""There is no way we can put that fire out,"" he thought. Jacobs hopped in a lifeboat. He screamed for co-workers to jump aboard. A second explosion rocked the rig. The lifeboat, still suspended in the air, went into a free fall of about 3 feet. ""Here I am on a lifeboat that's supposed to help me get off this rig,"" Jacobs thought. ""And I'm gonna wind up dying."" He bowed his head and prayed. Now, 50 days later, the survivors are telling their stories. It's become part of their everyday lives. They can't shake what happened that day, even when they close their eyes at night. ""It's like being in a neverending nightmare,"" Brown said. ""You dream about it. You see it in your sleep. Then, we wake up in the morning, and we realize it's not a dream. It's real. ... It doesn't end for us."" CNN's Aaron Cooper contributed to this report. This piece is part of a CNN Special Investigations Unit project.","Rig survivors say BP, Transocean official argued over shortcut on day of blast .

"(CNN) -- An E. coli outbreak linked to some raw vegetables has killed at least six people and sickened hundreds in Germany, national and global health authorities said Monday. The first investigation results released by the German federal unit responsible for disease control and prevention -- the Robert Koch Institute, under Germany's Ministry of Health -- indicated that the most recent infections were likely caused by consuming raw tomatoes, cucumbers and lettuce. The agency said it is advising consumers to avoid eating those foods, specifically in northern Germany. The institute is investigating six deaths, according to the World Health Organization. Three of those fatalities, all adults, were caused by hemolytic-uremic syndrome, or HUS, from E. coli. The other three fatalities -- all of them elderly -- were caused by an infection linked to HUS and E. coli, said Dr. Guenael Rodier of the World Health Organization. The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control said 329 cases of HUS have been reported since May 2. Though HUS is normally seen in children younger than 5, the vast majority of the current outbreak's cases are adults, and more than two-thirds are women, the center said Monday on its website. ""The source of the outbreak is under investigation, but contaminated food seems the most likely vehicle of infection,"" it said. Most of the patients are from, or have been to, northern Germany, primarily Hamburg, Northern Lower Saxony and Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, it said. Cases have been reported in Sweden, the United Kingdom, Netherlands and Denmark among people who have visited Germany, most of them northern Germany, it said. The European Food Safety Alert Network said EHEC, or enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli, a strain of E. coli that causes hemorrhage in the intestines, was found in organic cucumbers originating from Spain, packaged in Germany, and distributed to countries including Austria, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Germany, Hungary, Luxembourg and Spain. The Spanish Agency for Food Safety and Nutrition issued a statement saying that two Spanish companies producing cucumbers may be involved in the outbreak, and the agency is awaiting further results from Germany's investigation. ""This is the eye of the storm,"" said Oliver Grieve, a spokesman for the University Medical Centre Schleswig-Holstein, where one of the deaths occurred. ""We're working 24 hours here, and we're getting patients from all over northern Germany including Hamburg."" As of Monday, 115 patients were infected with EHEC -- 68 in the medical center's Kiel campus and 47 in its Lubeck campus. Eighty-two patients were stricken by HUS -- 42 in Kiel and 40 in Lubeck, he said. The fatality, an 86-year-old woman, died of HUS; her husband remains hospitalized with EHEC, Grieve said. ""Patients are coming in waves,"" he added. Cases of bloody diarrhea associated with HUS were first reported in Germany in the second week of May. The detection of E. coli on cucumbers was first reported on May 26. Germany's Federal Ministry of Food, Agriculture and Consumer Protection advised consumers to cook their food to a minimum temperature of 70 degrees Celsius (about 160 degrees Fahrenheit) for at least two minutes to kill any E. coli bacteria. Freezing food does not kill bacteria reliably, the ministry added. Russia said Monday it is suspending all imports of vegetables, including tomatoes, cucumbers and salad leaves, produced in Germany and Spain. The Russian Federal Agency for Health and Consumer Rights, Rospotrebnadzor, said on its website that it has not received information from the European Union on the causes of the infection and the measures taken to ""localize and eliminate the outbreak."" ""A decision might be taken in the next few hours regarding the ban on imports and sales of vegetables in Russia from all EU countries,"" the agency said.

"(CNN) -- If you've been mesmerized by the drama, like millions of other viewers watching coverage of the Olympic Games, you have heard the most heroic, inspirational stories of athletes reaching the pinnacle of international competition. Or, at least you think you have. The truth is American viewers are missing out on the best of the Games. Coverage of the Olympics in the United States understandably focuses on American athletes. That is as it should be, but not to this degree. By concentrating mainly on Americans' stories, the NBC network is depriving U.S. viewers of some of the most fascinating, moving and exciting aspects of the Olympics. How much have you heard, for example, about Guor Marial, who marched in the opening ceremony under the banner of ""Independent Olympic Athletes""? Marial became a marathoner after running for his life since he was a young boy in Sudan, growing up in the middle of one of the deadliest wars of the 20th century. He learned to run as he fought to escape from those who killed his siblings and relatives and later kidnapped and enslaved him. Imagine such a story of tragedy and redemption, from slavery to triumph. His life is a most unbelievable odyssey, culminating at the Olympic Games. His parents live in a village with no electricity or running water. He hasn't spoken to them in years and hopes someone will get word to them to try to get to a television to watch their son. It's fine to cheer for the Americans, but how about a cheer for Marial? There's one who deserves to become a star -- and one who should have NBC's cameras following him. His is not the only fascinating story at these Games. American viewers are interested in the performances of American competitors. There's nothing wrong with that, and there's nothing wrong with NBC producers offering profiles, even fawning ones, of the hometown athletes. But the U.S. public is missing out on what truly makes the Olympics special. The only time network viewers hear about other athletes, it seems, is when there are suspicions of doping or other violations, which could potentially help Americans. It would seem the rest of the world is there only to serve as the rivals Americans require to conquer the podium. No question, the United States has brilliant, talented, exciting competitors; everyone wants to see them. But in hundreds of hours of coverage, there should be room in the spotlight, time in the schedule, for the rest of the world. In NBC's telling, it's all about Michael Phelps and Ryan Lochte, about American gymnasts and swimmers, and soon enough about American track stars and, ultimately, about crowning the few who will grace the Wheaties box, who will sell us Subway sandwiches and Gatorade, Nike sneakers and Snickers chocolate bars. It's about manufacturing heroes because, in a truth we all know, too much of it is about making money. Behind the cynicism and the commercialism, however, the Games really do have the power to inspire. There truly is a history of toil and drama behind every athlete. That's because the Olympics are full of heroes, but they're hardly all Americans. (Although a remarkable number of them do make their home in the United States.) Every athlete has a story, and there are almost 15,000 athletes at London 2012. In addition to the rivalries at the pool and the very touching images of U.S. athletes' parents suffering and celebrating in the stands, we would all gain from hearing more about, say, Tahmina Kohistani, the lone woman in the Afghan delegation, who endured threats and taunts to keep her out of the Games. Because some people in some countries, including hers, are convinced that sports are no place for women. In Afghanistan, people have been killed for helping girls learn to read and write. Kohistani deserves a gold medal just for making it to the Games. Criticism of NBC's U.S.-centric coverage of the Olympics is nothing new. Overly nationalistic narratives and neglect of non-Americans are chronic problems, which attract attention every time the Olympics roll around. From the veteran sports writer Frank Deford to everyday viewers, many complain. As one blogger says, ""Watching the Olympics in the U.S. is no fun because the only thing you can watch is Americans winning."" American viewers, I have no doubt, would cherish the opportunity to learn more about the first women to compete for Saudi Arabia, Wojdan Ali Seraj Abdulrahim Shahrkhani and Sarah Attar, who represent a country where women are not only banned from participating in sports, they're even banned from watching sports events in major stadiums. The Olympics would have given NBC an unparalleled chance to receive permission for a glimpse into the secretive North Korea. We could have learned about the mysteries of training in the Hermit Kingdom for the two North Korean medal-winning weightlifters, Kim Un Guk and Om Yun Chol. Learning about how many hundreds of hours Lochte spent at the pool, or how many pairs of shoes he has in his collection is fine. But just think what more we could be discovering. Does it have to be this way? Is NBC just doing what viewers want? I don't think so. I believe Americans would relish the opportunity to find out about many other fascinating individuals competing at the Games. During my days at CNN, politics caused the United States and the Soviet Union to boycott each others' Olympics. CNN founder Ted Turner, my former boss, decided to create his own Olympics, staging the Goodwill Games over a span of 16 years. CNN producers and camera crews traveled the world to produce profiles of the men and women who would participate in Ted's most excellent sports adventure. The profiles were unforgettable. Americans may be missing out on some of the best of the Games. Fortunately, the rest of the world is not. As Afghanistan's Kohistani said, ""there are a lot of Afghan girls and women [who are] watching me and they hope that one day they shall be [in my place]. And I am going to open a new way for the women of Afghanistan."" One day, perhaps, Americans, too, will have the opportunity to gain inspiration from athletes like her, whose journey deserves more attention, even if she does not compete for the USA. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Frida Ghitis.","Frida Ghitis: Olympic coverage in the U.S. understandably focuses on U.S. athletes .

"Bong Mines, Liberia (CNN) -- Sitting beside the aging railway tracks running deeper into the forest of Liberia, we waited outside the frail wooden hut that was used as a makeshift railway station. Thunder rumbled ominously in the distance but there was no timetable so we had to sit and wait. After a few hours, the railway tracks began to vibrate with the sound of an on-coming train and the small band of passengers stood and looked down the tracks expectantly. Coming into sight, rolling slowly down the tracks, was the Liberian Express, or what is called locally -- ""Make-A-Rail."" It is a small wooden frame, running on ball-bearings and pushed by both the 'Make-A-Rail"" operators and passengers down the tracks to get to its destination. We climbed aboard. Two operators and a passenger, holding tightly to the wooden frame of what looks more like a cart, ran alongside and pushed the train. The tracks were visible through the floor and as we passed through the occasional village people would wave. On the slight declines, the ""Make-A-Rail"" would gain it's own momentum and the young men pushing would jump onboard and enjoy the ride. ""A lot of people, especially those with heavy commodities like charcoal, use these to take them to the market,"" explained one passenger, Fahnlon Gbakoyah. ""It's cheap to transport and it's faster."" The journey from the end of the railway line to Liberia's capital Monrovia can take up to 36hours by ""Make-A-Rail"" --only a 3hour journey by road - but it costs half the price. However, more importantly, the railway line passes through villages that have little access by road. ""This helps our people in the village,"" said another passenger, John Walker. ""If they get sick, we can put them in and quickly take them to hospital."" ""Make-A-Rail"" started in the 1990's during Liberia's 14-year civil war that left the country's infrastructure in ruins. But it's hard work. ""You get tired, so you have to rest for five minutes and then you get more power and can push again hard,"" said Eric Pearson, one of the operators. ""But it's tiring and makes my muscles sore."" But the train cannot roll faster than the storm clouds that gather overhead and another of ""Make-A-Rail's"" disadvantages quickly becomes apparent as we quickly get soaked in the rain. We get off at the next station to find cover but the young men continue to push the train down the tracks -- a long journey ahead and plenty of obstacles, but they're determined to make it anyway they can.","Liberia has a unique transport system - the ""Make-A-Rail"" train .

"(CNN) -- Track star Oscar Pistorius was a ""deceitful"" witness who cannot escape a murder conviction for his actions, prosecutor Gerrie Nel said Thursday, presenting his closing arguments in the athlete's trial. On Valentine's Day last year, Pistorius shot dead his girlfriend, model and law graduate Reeva Steenkamp. This week, both prosecutors and defenders in Pretoria, South Africa, get their last chance to argue his culpability or innocence, after a trial lasting months that has gripped observers around the world. The state contends that Pistorius, 27, not only murdered Steenkamp, 29, but that it was premeditated. It's now up to Pistorius' defense team to argue for the last time before the judge that the athlete mistook Steenkamp for an intruder when he fired four shots through the locked toilet door, killing her. Making his final arguments, prosecutor Nel told Judge Thokozile Masipa that lawyers for Pistorius had tried to present more than one defense -- and that they did not jibe. Pistorius is arguing that he didn't act, but if he did, he did so intentionally with a reason, the prosecutor said. ""Those two defenses cannot be argued,"" Nel charged. The prosecutor, renowned for his bulldog tenacity in questioning, also argued that Pistorius was a dishonest witness whose testimony was, in essence, ""devoid of any truth."" Using a metaphor reflecting Pistorius' career on the track, Nel said the athlete had ""dropped the baton of truth,"" and that ""without the baton of truth, you cannot complete the race."" Pistorius, who Nel said had always refused to take any responsibility, had ""tangled himself into a web"" when he tailored his evidence in chief to match his bail affidavit, the prosecutor claimed. And, Nel said, the evidence presented during the trial shows that Pistorius, who also faces three gun-related charges, ""displayed a blatant disregard for the law and the lives of others."" The prosecutor said that in Pistorius' own version of events, the athlete said he went to the toilet door and fired with the intention to kill or hit, believing there was someone behind it. At the point before he fired, he was armed with a high-powered weapon and was ""in charge"" of the situation, Nel said. This means, the prosecutor said, that Pistorius ""cannot escape"" a murder conviction, whether the court believes he thought there was an intruder behind the door or not. ""Our argument is that he should be convicted on all the counts,"" Nel said in conclusion. Defense: Errors in state case . Defense attorney Barry Roux began his closing arguments by pointing out what he called ""material mistakes"" made by the state. For example, he cited multiple instances of Nel calling Pistorius a liar. Nel told the court he had only found one example. Roux also presented evidence indicating that the crime scene was disturbed by officers, in support of the defense case. Nel had argued that the defense never proved Pistorius' claim of evidence tampering at the scene. And Roux reminded the court that Pistorius, who uses prostheses to walk after his lower legs were amputated as a child, suffers from anxiety. Roux pointed out that the onus is on the state to show burden of proof, and accused the state of avoiding certain important facts and ignoring other reasonable scenarios. Nel: Evidence suggests Pistorius aimed gun . Presenting the state's case, Nel argued that the defense failed to call any witnesses to corroborate Pistorius' story, and that there were failings in the tests carried out and inconsistencies in the defense evidence presented. For example, he said, it was telling that the defense never called a witness to back up its argument that when Pistorius screams, it sounds like a woman. Witnesses called to court testified they heard what they thought was a woman screaming on the night Steenkamp was killed. Nel said that nowhere in the defense's executive summary of its closing arguments was it said that the court should accept Pistorius' version of events. In fact, Nel said, the defense actually says Pistorius' ability to testify was compromised. Calling the Olympic sprinter an ""appalling"" witness, Nel said Pistorius was vague, argumentative and mendacious on the stand. Recapping the state case, Nel said the evidence from the bullet holes in the toilet door suggests Pistorius had time to think and looked down the sights of the gun as he fired -- meaning that he aimed the weapon. Nel said that Pistorius acted so unreasonably that his version could never be accepted as reasonably, possibly true. 'Snowball effect' Going though the evidence, he said Pistorius' claim that he reacted to a sound which retrospectively he believed to be a magazine rack moving inside the toilet room was a figment of his imagination. The sound never happened, Nel said. He said the marks of the four gunshots on the door, in a ""good grouping,"" show a shooter who was in control. And, he said, one could infer from their position relative to where Steenkamp was standing behind the door that Pistorius knew where he was aiming -- because he had spoken to her. He maintained that Pistorius got emotional before the shooting not because he was shouting at intruders, but because he was shouting at Steenkamp. Nel also argued the police could not have tampered with the scene in the way claimed by the accused, outlining what he said were a dozen inconsistencies in what Pistorius told the court. ""It was so many lies, in such a short period, that the snowball effect became so evident,"" he said of the athlete's version of events. Nel presented the pieces of evidence as a mosaic, arguing that each time Pistorius tried to move a piece to suit his version of events, other pieces had to move too. And in likely anticipation of the defense attacking the credibility of the state's witnesses, he argued that any inconsistencies in the timeline of events or what they recalled were a sign that they had not colluded and just wanted to tell the truth. Moving on to the couple's relationship, Nel said that even though only a small number of text and WhatsApp messages presented in court show the couple fighting, they are significant because they were sent in the weeks before Steenkamp was shot. He recalled one, sent by Steenkamp on January 27, 2013 that said: ""I am scared of you sometimes and how you snap at me and how you will react to me... "" Pistorius, wearing glasses, looked serious but composed as Nel made his case. Judge's decision . The closing arguments lower the curtain on a courtroom drama that, since March, has seen the Olympic sprinter break down in heaving sobs and vomiting in the courtroom as disturbing evidence was presented. Proceedings were delayed while Pistorius underwent a court-ordered month-long psychiatric evaluation. He was depressed, suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder, and is a suicide risk, the doctors concluded, but he did not appear to have a history of abnormal aggression or psychopathic tendencies linked to ""rage-type murders in intimate relations."" Nicknamed ""Blade Runner"" for the blade-like lower-leg prostheses he wears on the track, Pistorius has always admitted that he killed Steenkamp. The key question in his trial is that of intent. Masipa will decide his fate at a later date, which she will announce on Friday. There are no jury trials in South Africa. Masipa is assisted by two educated lay advisers -- called assessors -- in her decision. The judge's options on verdict and sentencing range from acquittal and freedom to conviction of premeditated murder and life in prison. It could take weeks for Masipa and the assessors to consider the evidence and testimony presented in court, which may cover up to 4,000 pages of court transcripts. If the judge believes beyond a reasonable doubt that Pistorius knew he was firing upon Steenkamp, then she will find him guilty of murder. If she rules it was premeditated, Pistorius would face a life sentence. In South Africa, he'd be required to serve at least 25 years. If it is not premeditated, he'd serve a minimum of 15 years. If Masipa sees any reasonable doubt that Pistorius knew Steenkamp was behind the bathroom door, she will not convict him of murder. Still, if she determines that Pistorius was unreasonable in his actions that led to Steenkamp's killing, she would find him guilty of culpable homicide. In that case, she would have to decide upon a sentence herself. If she believes there is a reasonable chance that Pistorius made a mistake and responded in a reasonable fashion, she will find him not guilty, which means the athlete could go free.

"(CNN) -- Many people are outraged about the just-revealed psychological experiment Facebook performed in 2012 on 690,000 unwitting people, altering the mix of positive and negative posts in their feeds. Playing with people's emotions without their consent is a problem. But it would be even worse if we think -- after Facebook posts one of its all-too-common apologies -- that Facebook is done manipulating its users. No. The experiment was only a more intrusive version of what the company does every time we visit our Facebook page. Facebook's experiment was a version of so-called ""A/B"" testing, one of the most widely used and effective techniques large websites use to ""provide a better customer experience"" -- that is, to sell us more stuff. For example, for years Amazon has routinely experimented with seemingly insignificant changes to its pages, like showing half of its visitors a discount offer on the left side, and the same ad on the right to the other half. If Amazon finds a statistically significant uptick in clicks on the offer when it's on one side, from then on that's where they put the offers. Companies A/B test every parameter about a page, from font sizes to colors to the depth of the drop shadows. But the Facebook experiment was not normal A/B testing. Usually a test alters some seemingly irrelevant factor. But Facebook's experiment changed the site's core service: showing us what's up with our friends. Worse, Facebook did so in a way likely to affect the emotional state of its users. And that's something to be concerned about. But much of the outrage is driven by a false assumption: that there is a ""real"" mix of news about our friends. There isn't. Facebook always uses algorithms to figure out what to show us and what to leave obscure. Facebook is in the business of providing us with a feed that filters the Colorado River rapids into a tinkling stream we can drink from. The 2012 experiment is a window onto this larger concern: Facebook, an important and even dominant part of our social infrastructure, makes decisions about what we'll know about our friends based on what works for Facebook, Inc., and only secondarily based on what works for us as individuals and as a society. This point is illustrated in Eli Pariser's excellent book (and terrific TED Talk) The Filter Bubble. Facebook filters our feeds to make us happier customers. But Facebook defines a happy customer as one that comes back often and clicks on a lot of links. When it comes to politics, we can easily see the problem: Showing us news that excites our click finger is a formula for promoting shouting and political divisiveness. Too much of that is bad, but in both politics and social relationships more broadly, do we know what the ""right mix"" is? Are we sure that filtering social news so that it includes more of the negative is bad? And positive filtering can paint a too-rosy picture of our social network, shielding us from the full force of life as it is actually lived. I don't know the answer, but it can't come from a commercial entity whose overriding aim is to keep us coming back so we can buy more from its advertisers. There are many options to play with here. For example, we could be given more individual control over our own filters. Or a site could ""nudge"" us toward feeds that achieve socially desirable aims like making us more willing to explore and embrace differences. But we're unlikely to see such options so long as we have given control over our the flow of our social information to commercial entities that have as their primary interest not the health of our society and culture, but their bottom line. Sometimes those interests may align, but not reliably or often enough. So, I'm upset about Facebook's cavalier toying with our emotions, but I'm far more disturbed about what Facebook and other such sites do all the time.","David Weinberger: Many angry over Facebook's psychological experiment on users in 2012 .

"(CNN) -- Malaysia says it will send back to New Zealand an envoy who used diplomatic immunity to flee a sex charge there, defusing a messy wrangle between the nations. Malaysia's government released a statement Wednesday saying it would return Second Warrant Officer Muhammad Rizalman Ismail to New Zealand ""to cooperate fully and assist"" authorities in their investigation into allegations against him . Ismail, 38, faces charges of burglary and assault with intent to commit rape, relating to an alleged attack in Wellington on May 9, according to officials in both countries. Superintendent Sam Hoyle, commander of Wellington police district where the alleged offenses took place, said in a statement that Ismail would be arrested at the New Zealand border and taken to the nearest court on his return. No date had yet been set for Ismail's return, he said. New Zealand Foreign Minister Murray McCully welcomed the news of Ismail's impending return, saying in a statement that it underlined the ""good faith and integrity"" with which Malaysia had approached the case. Ismail was working as a defense staff assistant at Malaysia's High Commission in Wellington when he allegedly stalked a 21-year-old woman and attacked her in her home. He was apprehended by police and appeared in court the next day, but returned to Malaysia with his family on May 22, Malaysia's Ministry of Foreign Affairs said in a statement. The case caused an outcry when it was reported in the New Zealand media, with Prime Minister John Key telling reporters it was his country's ""very strong preference"" that the man face justice there, rather than in Malaysia. But it later emerged that while at a formal level New Zealand had pressed Malaysia to waive Ismail's diplomatic immunity, Malaysian officials were under the impression after informal discussions that the New Zealand government was comfortable with him returning home to face justice, CNN affiliate TVNZ reported. McCully apologized Wednesday for his ministry's handling of the case, TVNZ reported. ""It is now clear to me that officials engaged in informal communications over what is a complex case, in a manner that would have been ambiguous to the Malaysian government,"" he said in a statement. ""I can say that the Malaysian side have acted entirely in good faith."" Under the 1961 Vienna Convention, diplomats are granted full immunity from local laws while embassy staff are immune from criminal charges but not from specific civil matters. Malaysia's Ministry of Foreign affairs said in its statement that it had ""complete faith in the New Zealand legal system"" and ""full confidence"" Ismail would be dealt with fairly.","Malaysian official who used diplomatic immunity to flee a sex charge caused outcry in New Zealand .

"(CNN) -- The full U.S. Supreme Court granted a stay of execution for a Missouri death row inmate whose rare birth defect, his lawyers argued, would have made his death an ""excruciating"" process. The stay will remain in place pending the 8th Circuit Court's ruling on the matter, a court document said Wednesday. Russell Bucklew had been scheduled to die early Wednesday at Eastern Reception, Diagnostic and Correctional Center in Bonne Terre, Missouri. It would have been the first execution since Oklahoma botched a procedure last month. Bucklew, who turned 46 last week, is already in pain, as his condition includes unstable tumors in his head and neck, causing him to bleed regularly from his mouth, nose, eyes and ears, said defense attorney Cheryl Pilate. Dr. Joel Zivot of Emory University filed an affidavit in the case saying that Bucklew's airway is so ""severely compromised and obstructed,"" especially when he's lying flat, that it could easily be ruptured, raising the risk that Bucklew could choke or suffocate. ""If you touch it, it bleeds,"" Zivot wrote of Bucklew's airway. In 1997, a jury convicted Bucklew of first-degree murder, kidnapping and first-degree burglary and recommended the death sentence, court documents show. He was accused of fatally shooting his ex-girlfriend's presumed new boyfriend, Michael Sanders, and firing at Sanders' son, 6, before kidnapping Stephanie Ray Pruitt. After raping his ex-girlfriend, he became involved in a gunfight with authorities, during which Bucklew and a Missouri state trooper were injured, according to court documents. Controversy over lethal injections has been brewing in recent years after European manufacturers, including the Denmark-based manufacturer of pentobarbital, banned U.S. prisons from using their drugs in executions. In 2009, the U.S.-based manufacturer of sodium thiopental, a drug also commonly used in executions, stopped making the painkiller. Many states have scrambled to find substitutes from overseas or have used American-based compounding pharmacies to create substitutes. Attorneys for death row inmates in several states have flooded the court system, arguing that correctional facilities' secrecy over where and how they obtain drugs is unconstitutional and violates the Eighth Amendment's ""cruel and unusual"" punishment clause. Last month, Oklahoma used a new three-drug injection protocol to execute convicted murderer and rapist Clayton Lockett, but his vein collapsed, and he died of an apparent heart attack. A full investigation and autopsy results are still pending, but witnesses said they saw Lockett struggling to speak as he convulsed and writhed on the gurney. Previously, Oklahoma inmate Michael Lee Wilson said during his January execution, ""I feel my whole body burning."" Wilson was executed using a cocktail that included pentobarbital, as was Texas' Jose Luis Villegas, who also complained of a burning sensation during his April execution. Also in Texas, Robert James Campbell's attorneys challenged the state's plan to administer pentobarbital to their client. A federal court stayed his execution last week, not because of the drugs Texas planned to use but because his defense team deserved more time to make the case that Campbell was intellectually disabled. On Monday, the Georgia Supreme Court weighed in on the issue, reversing a stay of execution for inmate Warren Lee Hill after his attorneys argued last year that a statute keeping the compounders of lethal injection drugs ""a confidential state secret"" was unconstitutional. ""We hold that it is not,"" Justice P. Harris Hines wrote in the 33-page majority opinion. He said the reason for keeping such information private is ""obvious, including avoiding the risk of harassment or some other form of retaliation from persons related to the prisoners or from others in the community who might disapprove of the execution as well as simply offering those willing to participate whatever comfort or peace of mind that anonymity might offer.""

"(CNN) -- Tiger Woods has not only declared himself fit to play at this week's PGA Championship, after playing nine holes of practice at Valhalla on Wednesday, but he's also eying a fifth title. Since he withdrew from the WGC-Bridgestone Invitational on Sunday after jarring his troublesome back, Woods' participation had dominated the buildup to the final major of the year. However, the 38-year-old's physiotherapist fixed a problem that had looked set to rule him out, after Woods dislocated his sacrum -- a bone at the base of his spine -- when landing in a bunker. ""I felt good once the bone was put back in,"" the former number one told reporters on Wednesday evening. ""I'm not in any pain."" ""Once he put it back in, the spasms went away and from there I started getting some range of motion. ""The inflammation has been down, I have range of motion, my speed and power -- and I just need to keep it up."" Leaderboard: PGA Championship . Woods' participation had been in serious doubt prior to his practice round, after he struggled to tie his shoes on Sunday because of pain. Yet there was better still for Woods' legion of fans as he responded to the question of whether he could win in Louisville with a resounding 'Yes'. ""(To) try to go out there and win this event, that's all I'm focused on,"" said Woods, who won the PGA Championship the last time it was held at Valhalla Golf Club in 2000. Following surgery to treat a trapped nerve in his back in March, a three-month layoff forced the American to miss both the Masters -- for the first time in his career -- and the U.S. Open. His back problems appeared to have been put behind him until the weekend flare-up in Ohio, only the third PGA Tour event he had contested since the operation. However, Woods says Sunday's injury was unrelated to the operation earlier this year. ""It was a different pain to what I had been experiencing so I know it was not the site of the surgery,"" he explained. Woods' confidence about any potential victory flies in the face of his recent performances in the majors, having failed to win any of the last 19 he has contested. In his last appearance at July's British Open, he finished 69th -- a performance that would have been unimaginable prior to the decline in his game following the well-documented marital problems he suffered in 2009. Trailing the all-time record held by Jack Nicklaus, 14-time major winner Woods needs to prove his form and fitness this week to have a hope of making Tom Watson's team for next month's Ryder Cup against Europe in Scotland. While keeping a close eye on Woods' practice round, the veteran Watson also named Steve Stricker as one his Ryder Cup vice-captains on Wednesday -- with the 47-year-old joining Andy North and Raymond Floyd as an assistant. Woods' form this season barely reflects the feverish speculation over his fitness, since his best finish from the seven tournaments he has contested worldwide is a lowly 25th. Should he suffer no further problems, Woods will partner former champions Phil Mickelson and Padraig Harrington when he tees off on Thursday. He is chasing his fifth title after winning the event in 1999, 2000, 2006 and 2007. PGA breaks with tradition . In a separate development on Wednesday, PGA Championship organizers announced that the 2016 edition of the competition will be held in July. The event is traditionally held in August but with golf featuring at that year's Olympics for the first time since 1904, with the Rio Games running between August 5-21, the PGA has been forced into a change. The tournament scheduled for Baltusrol in New Jersey will now take place on July 28-31. ""It's a condensed schedule,"" PGA of America chief executive officer Pete Bevacqua told reporters at Valhalla. ""Obviously with the Olympics, it's also a Ryder Cup year, you throw in the (PGA playoffs), so it's a very congested schedule.""","Woods declares himself fit to play Thursday's PGA Championship .

"(CNN) -- There is no shortage of adjectives one can apply to airline seats: uncomfortable, bulky, cramped, outdated and -- from an airline's point of view -- overpriced. It's no wonder then that many carriers are looking to make a change. Ditching the screens? Dr. Mark Hiller, CEO at Recaro Aircraft Seating, notes that accommodating passengers' personal devices has become an imperative, though one that few manufacturers have yet to address. ""Connectivity is no longer just an option, but a necessity,"" he says. At the Aircraft Interiors Expo in Hamburg, Germany last month, Recaro unveiled their newest design in economy seating, called the BL3530. The new seat features a tablet PC holder, a ""smart pocket"" for stowing devices (and protecting them from scratches) and a power supply for charging. Shedding pounds . The BL3530 follows another vital trend; at 10 kilograms per seat, it's lighter than its predecessors. ""Fuel costs are extremely high these days -- this is just an accepted fact in the industry. As a result, every kilogram counts,"" says James Lee, director of Paperclip Design Limited, an award-winning industrial design studio. The lightest chair on the market is made by relative newcomer Expliseat, a French company that has crafted a model made from titanium and composite materials. It weights just 4 kilograms. The company estimates the weight savings could translate into $500,000 of fuel savings per aircraft per year. According to Benjamin Saada, Expliseat's CEO, the CO2 savings are even more significant. ""Every aircraft we equip saves 1,200 tons of CO2 per year. That's the equivalent of planting 45,000 trees,"" he says. ""Imagine if every airplane in the world signed on. It could completely change the global fuel emissions."" 2022: Cheap flights, more rail and hands-free cars . Get a convertible . One particularly awkward feature of airline seats is their lack of versatility. They recline, and that's about as adaptive as they get. Papercilp is hoping to change that with its new Caterpillar Convertible seat, which won the premium class and VIP category at the Crystal Cabin Award this year. The Caterpillar can be configured as a roomy Premium Economy seat, or converted into a Business Class seat with a lie-flat bed and direct aisle access. ""The core aim is to allow airlines to adjust their cabin capacity based on demand,"" says Lee. ""Flights from London to New York might have a big need for Business Class, for example, but if you use the same plane to fly to Phuket, the demand for lie-flat seats could be a lot less. This design allows the airline to adapt,"" he adds. The armrest of the future? This is not the first year Paperclip has scooped up an award for its designs. The trademark Paperclip armrest -- a dual-level version that grants both parties access -- has picked up several accolades over the years. Unfortunately, there hasn't been a lot of demand for the innovation, and its potential for a more democratic approach to elbow room. ""I've showed the design to a lot of manufactures, and they'll say, 'oh, that's nice,' but there hasn't been a lot of need for it. The issue is cost,"" he says. Though the concept may not catch on on planes, it could become a feature of seating on the ground. ""It's more likely to one day see (the armrest) in theaters and cinemas. There are fewer regulations on the ground than in the air, so there's less resistance to new products,"" he says. Apparently This Matters: Airplane armrest for two . Turned around . Zodiac Aerospace has also been experimenting with an alternate seating layout that could provide passengers with substantially more legroom (a 31-inch pitch instead of the more standard 27-inch). The HD 31 concept would feature two forward-facing seats sandwiching a single backward-facing seat. According to Pierre-Antony Vastra, an executive vice president at Zodiac, the layout has, ""raised a lot of interest."" ""It provides a larger space for the shoulders while enabling the airline to board the same number of passengers,"" he says.","Airlines are seeking seating innovations .

"(CNN) -- Secretary of State John Kerry has agreed to testify before the House Oversight Committee on the deadly Benghazi terror attack, according to a letter from his office to the panel that was obtained by CNN. Kerry was subpoenaed by Oversight panel Chairman Darrell Issa of California after new emails surfaced that Republicans say support their contention the Obama administration politicized its public response to the September 2012 assault. The attack on the U.S. diplomatic compound in eastern Libya killed Ambassador Christopher Stevens and three other Americans. It's not clear whether the recent formation of a House Select Committee to investigate Benghazi will impact the Oversight probe. The Republican-led Select Committee is still organizing and hasn't scheduled any hearings. According to the letter to Issa that was copied to top members of the Select Committee as well, the State Department said Kerry could not accommodate the Oversight panel's demand that he appear on May 29 due to scheduling conflicts. However, the letter said Kerry was ""prepared to appear"" at a later hearing, which the panel has now set for June 12. ""The committee looks forward to his appearance,"" Frederick Hill, a spokesman for the panel, said in a statement. Additionally, the State Department believes that an appearance before Issa's committee next month would ""remove any need"" for him to testify before the Select Committee to ""answer additional questions.""

"(CNN) -- Former Argentina coach Diego Maradona has agreed a two-year deal to manage Dubai-based Al Wasl, according to the club. Maradona, who is widely acknowledged to be one of the finest players the game has ever seen, spent the weekend negotiating with club officials in the United Arab Emirates. The 50-year-old, who led his native Argentina to the quarterfinals of the 2010 World Cup where they were beaten 4-0 by Germany, has signed a two-year contract and will be unveiled in June. Maradona represented his country 91 times as a player, scoring 34 goals, and led Argentina to a World Cup triumph in 1986. His playing career lasted 21 years and he played in Spain for Barcelona, and for Napoli, in the Italian League. ''Al Wasl Sports Club is proud to announce the appointment of Diego Armando Maradona as head coach of Al Wasl Football Club, in a momentous development that will see the football legend lead the team for the next two seasons,'' a statement reported by AFP said. The club's vice-chairman Marwane Ben Bayatt, who conducted discussions with Maradona, added: ''Al Wasl Sports Club has become synonymous with achievements of this caliber, and we are very pleased to be welcoming Maradona to a long line of accolades in the club's history. ''This partnership embodies the vision of the club as it embraces forward thinking developments in the region to establish unprecedented standards for the sport.'' Maradona was fired after Argentina's crushing defeat to Germany and has been linked with a number of jobs in England and Iran since. Al Wasl currently sit fourth in UAE's domestic league and have been managerless since Brazilian Sergio Farias was fired in March. They were crowned Gulf Champions last year.","Diego Maradona will be the new coach of Dubai-based Al Wasl, the club say .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- The federal government is calling a human-trafficking lawsuit against a California-based farm labor contractor and eight farms the largest case of alleged forced labor of farm workers in the United States. The lawsuit, made public in Los Angeles by the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, accused Global Horizons Manpower Inc., based in Beverly Hills, California; and eight farms in Hawaii and Washington state of luring more than 200 men from Thailand to work at farms where they were subjected to abuse. The government alleges that between 2003 and 2007, Global Horizons promised hundreds of workers lucrative jobs in the United States, and then charged the workers exorbitant recruitment fees that they were expected to work to pay off. In some cases, according the lawsuit, the workers owed tens of thousands of dollars. ""I did not earn 70-80,000 baht (about $2,340 to $2,680) per month while working on the farm, as the recruiters had promised,"" said one Thai man, identified as ""Ken,"" in a redacted statement provided by the Thai Community Development Center, which filed the complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. ""Instead, I was paid $9.03 per hour and my hours were very inconsistent,"" said Ken, who said he borrowed money using his parents' home and land as collateral to pay the 550,000 baht (about $18,430) recruitment fee. ""There was not enough work for all the workers, so some days I would get to work and other days I would not,"" he said. ""I was very concerned about not getting to work every day, since I desperately needed the work so that I could pay off my debt. I was afraid that my family would lose their house and farm if I did not earn enough money to pay off the debt."" Telephone numbers listed for Global Horizons offices in Hawaii and California were not in service Wednesday. The company did not respond to a CNN e-mail request for comment. The men were brought to the United States under a federal H2-A visa program, which places foreign workers on U.S. farms. But once the men arrived, the suit says, their passports were confiscated and they were not paid for their work. It also alleges that many of the workers were barred from leaving the farms and were forced to live in cramped, dirty conditions. In many cases, the Thai workers were threatened with deportation if they complained about the conditions, the lawsuit said. ""Some were left without water. Others were given inadequate food to eat,"" said EEOC attorney Anna Y. Park, who filed the lawsuit Tuesday against Global Horizons Manpower and the farms. ""In some cases, bodyguards were stationed around the farms so they could not escape."" The government named six farms in Hawaii and two farms in Washington in the lawsuit, alleging the companies not only ignored abuses but participated in the ""obvious mistreatment, intimidation, harassment, and unequal pay of the Thai workers."" The lawsuit alleges the workers endured screaming, threats and physical assaults by their supervisors and were threatened with deportation if they complained. ""I feel what my traffickers did to me was not right and I do not want them to be able to do this to other people,"" said another man, ""Sawat,"" in his statement. ""I hope that justice is brought against them."" Sawat said he borrowed 650,000 baht, or $21,000, to pay the recruitment fee. Federal criminal charges were brought last year against Global Horizons' owner, Mordechai Orian, and others for the alleged trafficking of more than 400 Thai workers. But this week marked the first time the federal government implicated farms in the case. None of the farms faces criminal charges. The farms in Hawaii include: Captain Cook Coffee Co., Del Monte Fresh Produce, Kauai Coffee Co., Kelena Farms, MacFarms of Hawaii and Maui Pineapple Farms. The farms in Washington state were identified as Green Acre Farms and Valley Fruit Orchards. Del Monte denied the allegations, saying in a written statement to CNN that it ""did not engage in or support any alleged mistreatment of Thai workers, nor did it receive complaint from the Thai workers."" It also said the company had already sued Global Horizons for breach of contract based on the EEOC charges filed on behalf of the Thai workers. The Captain Cook Coffee Co. also denied the allegations, saying it fully cooperated with the EEOC investigation and that the federal agency has refused to identify any specific wrongdoing by the company. ""The complaint filed this week again offers no factual basis for any of the allegations against Captain Cook,"" the company said in a written statement. Kauai Coffee Co.'s owner, Alexander and Baldwin, said in a statement, ""We are disappointed that the EEOC continues to include our company in their claims against Global Horizons, Inc., despite years of our cooperation with their investigation against Global and without any evidence of wrongdoing by Kauai Coffee Company, Inc."" The company said it had never been informed by any workers from Thailand, the government or anyone else that the Thai workers were mistreated while at Kauai Coffee. It said it assisted with the government investigation and conducted its own investigation, which ""confirmed a strongly positive working relationship between the Thai workers and Kauai Coffee employees. We made multiple requests of the EEOC to identify specific acts of wrongdoing and have not received any information."" Telephone messages left by CNN seeking comment were not immediately returned by Mac Farms of Hawaii. There was no answer at Maui Pineapple Farms. A telephone message left by CNN for the attorney representing the Washington farms was not immediately returned. The federal lawsuit accuses Global Horizons and the farms of violating the Civil Rights Act. It is seeking back pay and monetary damages of between $50,000 and $300,000 for each worker. The EEOC said that the case could potentially involve hundreds of victims and witnesses. The first allegations of mistreatment of Thai farm laborers was brought to light in late 2003 when a worker escaped a farm in Hawaii, said Chanchanit Martorell, executive director of the Thai Community Development Center -- the agency that first brought the case to the attention of the government. . Martorell said the man was the first of more than 260 Thai workers who made their way to the nonprofit agency. All she said recounted similar stories: A poor Thai farmer is approached by a labor contractor, offered what is said to be a lucrative job on a farm in the United States and then arrives only to find he owes thousands of dollars in recruiting fees. ""They end up getting their passports confiscated,"" Martorell told CNN. ""They are completely restricted in their freedom. They are not allowed to move around. In some cases, they are under surveillance."" ""Ken"" said he eventually bought a bus ticket to Los Angeles, where he has worked at restaurants. He said he now earns about $500 a week and sends money to his family in Thailand ""to support them and to pay off the large amount of debt that I still owe for my Global Horizons recruitment fee."" He said he still owes 90,000 baht, or nearly $3,020. The Geneva-based International Labour Organization, which tracks forced-labor statistics, estimates the world's current ""human trafficking stock"" is 2.4 million people. While many associate stories of forced labor with the trafficking primarily of women and children as sex workers, analysts say labor trafficking involves as many men as it does women and children. ""The workers who are trafficked for labor purposes tend to work in sectors that are isolated from the mainstream,"" said Kathleen Newland, the director of the Migrants, Migration and Development and Refugee Protection Programs at the Migration Policy Institute.","Farm owners deny allegations, say they did not abuse Thai workers .

"(CNN) -- From a stock market perspective, the month of June was one of the nastiest on record for the Dubai Financial Market. It lost 22% from beginning to end, putting this small exchange with high volatility into bear market territory. This is a bad start for its first official month of trading as an emerging market after a reclassification by MSCI. Dubai's DFM broke through the 5,000 level in April, but the intense selling took the index down to below 4,000 on Monday, before investors spotted another buying opportunity. On Tuesday, the index was down 5%, then finished the day up 3%. It seems a ""casino-like culture"" has set in. As Saleem Kokar, head of equities at National Bank of Abu Dhabi Asset Management said, ""the fundamentals just don't make sense."" After peaking at 19 times 2014 earnings, the June correction took it down to more reasonable levels of 13 times earnings. But after the market wash-out in June, the DFM is still up 82% in the past 12 months of trading. The real danger, fund managers suggest, is that relatively new investors have borrowed to buy property stocks. Once the selling started they sold their holdings having to cover their loans. One property stock in particular triggered this market madness. Arabtec is a large construction group which has business scattered all over the Middle East and North Africa. Its former CEO Hassan Ismaik was forced to resign last month after it was found that he stockpiled 28% of the company's shares, most of them in the span of a month. He is now offering to sell his stake for double what the stock is currently trading and go on his merry way. Fund managers and markets strategists tell me trading activity around Arabtec screams out for market reform and greater transparency -- something the MSCI listed as a requirement before the UAE and Qatar markets were assigned an upgrade to the emerging market club. But the June sell-off is bringing Dubai's red-hot property market back into focus. Residential real estate values climbed 33% year-on-year in the first quarter of the year and are nearly back at levels seen in 2008 before the property bubble burst the next year. Hotel occupancy rates hit 88% in the same timeframe according to property consultancy Jones Lang LaSalle. Kokar of NBAD told me he hopes this market matures enough to strip out the volatility and identify the underlying fundamentals -- chief among them is solid economic growth. The UAE is expected to expand by some 5% this year, as a result of Dubai securing the World Expo in 2020 and intense infrastructure spending in neighboring Abu Dhabi, which controls most of the oil wealth in the federation. On a recent visit to the Dubai trading floor, retired school teacher turned private trader Zakariya Al-Assar did a simple calculation, telling me the Dow Industrial index was trading above 16,500 and Dubai below 5,000. ""We are looking for more Inshallah,"" he said meaning if God is willing. His prayers, so far, have not been answered.

"Los Angeles, California (CNN) -- Michael Jackson's father will have to wait until next month before a judge decides whether he'll get a monthly allowance from the pop star's estate. Joe Jackson, who was not included in his son's will, is asking for as much as $20,000 a month. At a hearing Thursday, Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Mitchell Beckloff delayed arguments until January 28, because not all of the lawyers involved had been notified. Beckloff also threw out a petition by a British woman who claims she was married to Michael Jackson when he died and is the mother of his three children. Beckloff told Nona Paris Lola Jackson, who was on the phone from England, that her petition claiming the rights to Jackson's estate was ""replete with deficiencies."" ""You have no evidence you were married to Mr. Jackson,"" Beckloff said. Her legal efforts to claim Jackson's children as her own began three years ago, but she filed her probate claim soon after his death last summer. Billie Jean Jackson, another woman claiming to be the mother of Jackson's children, also was in court, but her long-standing claim was not heard. The estate executors have not filed any objections to Joe Jackson's request for a monthly allowance, although lead lawyer Howard Weitzman did not rule out the possibility it would be contested. Katherine Jackson, 79, supports her husband's request for a monthly allowance, her probate lawyer, Adam Streisand, said last month. The petition of Joe Jackson, the 81-year-old patriarch of the Jackson family, said he has been financially dependent on Michael Jackson for years. It estimated that his monthly expenses come to $15,000. Jermaine Jackson said it was ridiculous that his father even had to ask. ""That shouldn't even be,"" Jermaine Jackson told CNN. ""The fact is my father is the estate. He created the estate."" Michael's mother and his three children, who live with her now, share an $86,000 monthly allowance. Michael Jackson died on June 25, 2009, from what the coroner ruled was ""acute propofol intoxication,"" referring to an anesthetic. A criminal investigation is continuing. A 2002 will placed Jackson's estate -- estimated to be in the hundreds of millions -- into a trust that benefits Michael Jackson's mother, his three children and charities to be chosen later. Joe Jackson told CNN earlier this year that he was not surprised or hurt to learn Michael left him out of his will. ""That's the way he wanted it,"" he said. ""And it's not going to hurt me that I was left out of his will. But it happened."" Joe Jackson's lawyer, Brian Oxman, is pursuing a legal challenge of the will, but Beckloff ruled Jackson had no voice in the matter. That decision is now before a California appeals court. Joe Jackson is challenging Michael Jackson's signature on the will because it was dated on a day he was in New York, not in Los Angeles as the document said. He is also challenging the fitness of John Branca and John McClain, the executors named in the will who now control the estate. Katherine Jackson, who had engaged in a bitter challenge of her own against Branca and McClain, dropped her opposition at a hearing last month. It was a surprise to her husband's lawyer, who was in court to launch Joe Jackson's challenge. ""She has now reneged on her obligation to her family,"" Oxman told the judge. Oxman said Katherine Jackson's reversal was ""one of the most despicable displays"" he's ever seen in court. Oxman accused Katherine Jackson of reaching a secret deal with the men who control their son's estate. Her lawyer fired back. ""That is not only baseless, but just a product of Mr. Oxman's imagination,"" Streisand said. There was no deal and it was a surprise to the estate lawyers, he said. Four of the Jackson sons, who are promoting the premiere of their new reality show, declined to talk about the squabble. ""To be honest with you, we've been busy shooting this, and no, we've not been following the estate,"" Marlon Jackson said. ""There's other family members that keep us abreast of what's going, the day-to-day details,"" Tito Jackson said. ""But we know what's going on,"" Jermaine Jackson said. Marlon Jackson said he couldn't understand why the public is so interested in negative news about the Jackson family. ""You're busy getting your little Jackson fix, we're busy trying to finish our show. We're really not interested in that part,"" he said. ""We're trying to keep things on a more positive front and move forward on that level, because there's so many positive things that has taken place with this family."" The Jackson brothers' TV show, ""The Jacksons: A Family Dynasty,"" debuts on the A&E cable network Sunday night.","NEW: Arguments delayed until January because not all lawyers notified .

"(CNN) -- People have called 911 to complain about lousy hamburgers and cold french fries, but what happened Sunday night in a Connecticut town may have set a new standard for misuse of emergency calls. The cause of the crisis? Viewers couldn't watch their cable TV programs. And if Facebook posts are any indication, ""Breaking Bad"" was what the viewers wanted most. A power outage knocked out cable service Sunday evening in parts of Connecticut, leaving Cablevision customers unable to watch television, including the hit show now in its final season. While most viewers chose to wait for service to be restored, others opted for a far less rational course of action: calling 911. The Fairfield Police Department was not amused and took to its Facebook page to post a refresher course on using its emergency system. The message read: . ""We are receiving numerous 911 calls regarding the Cablevison outage. This is neither an emergency or a police related concern. Please direct your inquiries to Cablevision. 911 should only be called for Life Threatening Emergencies ONLY. Incidents that are not of an emergency nature may be reported to the Fairfield Police Department. ... Misuse of the 911 system may result in an arrest."" Cablevision said it had restored service by 11 p.m. Sunday. But judging by the comments on the Fairfield Police Facebook page, the fallout was far from over. Among the many comments about being unable to watch ""Breaking Bad"": ""Yes, this was a huge misuse of 911,"" one comment read, ""but privately, I think it was kind. Of. Awesome. Tonight's breaking bad was super intense and Very riveting by every second. Obviously these folks were not thinking rationally when reaching for the phone."" When a lack of cable TV is a reason to call 911, ""I have to wonder what this world is coming to and if people truly understand the definition of emergency,"" read another comment. A resident named Ben Gott may have had the best solution. ""When my Internet went out an hour ago,"" he wrote on Facebook, ""I took a hint, put one of my dad's old jazz records on the turntable, and pulled out a good book. That, plus the crickets and peepers, has turned this into a very good night indeed.""","A power outage knocked out cable in parts of Connecticut .

"(CNN) -- When Google announced its cloud-based Chromebook Pixel laptop, the tech community was left puzzled. They couldn't put a little category box around the Pixel, so they began berating the only thing they could: the software. But sometimes a new product comes along that represents a major shift in how we have learned to do things. Google loaned me a Pixel for this review, and I liked it so much that after I returned the review model I purchased my own. I've been using it for more than a month, but it only takes turning the computer on once to realize how different it is from anything else out there. First, though, some background: Google's Chromebooks are built on the promise of cloud computing, where your files live not on your hard drive but on Web servers. Everything you upload is just a click away if you want it to be. The files don't physically have to be in the same location as the worker. More and more people are embracing the cloud, not just at work, but on their personal machines, too. They upload all sorts of files, accessible anywhere. Enter the Chromebook. Within the last two years, Google has started selling these affordable computers that run an operating system called Chrome OS. Chrome OS, and its open-source sibling, Chromium OS, are Google's answer to the desktop computer. Built for the cloud, they run through a combination of the Chrome OS browser and Web apps. Up to now, the computers have been inexpensive and fast. But Google has done something unexpected with the new Chromebook Pixel. This new computer is still very much a Chromebook, but it boasts sturdy, Apple-like aluminium unibody design. It also has a gorgeous touchscreen that demands to be seen and touched. You can interact with all your content with just a swipe of your finger. After the computer boots up, simply log into your Google account and all your apps, e-mail, calendar appointments and contacts load instantly. Google has created a seductive app launcher, sort of like how Apple operates with its iLife suite but still unique. Instead of a physical computer dictating how you do what you do, the Chromebook Pixel is offering you a way to work and connect that requires only your username and password. Let's jump right into some of my favorite features: . -- Trackpad. It's the best I have ever used. It is fluid and responsive and in my opinion, better than the MacBook Pro trackpads I've used in the past. -- Keyboard action response. It is not too firm but not too mushy, as I have experienced on some Apple laptops. Depressing a key on the chiclet-style keyboard produces just the right amount of pushback. I have found that the action of the keys is just stiff enough to prevent accidental bumping of other keys while your hands move across the keyboard. -- Display. The resolution on the screen, my favorite feature, is simply amazing, although it's more than just the crispness of the screen. The way it renders colors is completely unique. I have used MacBook ""Retina display"" laptops before, but I prefer the color of the Pixel's display, which appear warmer and more alive. The screen's viewing angles are wide and have very little glare -- perfect for viewing in a group setting. Now here are three features I don't like so much: . -- Battery Life. I am usually plugged into a wall socket for power, but on the rare chance I venture out without the charger; I'm disappointed how quickly the battery gets to red. I wonder if there is a software update that can do some improvement on power management of the battery? -- Charging port. It can sometimes get unhinged from the computer by the tiniest accidental pull of the wire. I wish the computer held the power cord a little more snugly so I would not have to keep plugging it back in. -- Fan noise. I don't usually hear the fan running unless I have a lot of windows open on my screen or am watching a hi-def video. But the Pixel's fan can get spinning very fast and loud. I wonder if a software update would be able correct this when the fan speed switches to hyper-drive. Still, on balance the Chromebook Pixel is a fine machine. The computer is very quick, thanks to a beefy processor and the fact that most tasks are done via apps online. Its Chrome OS has a history of being secure (although cloud computing will never be as protected as a local personal hard-drive). Earlier this year Google held a competitive hackathon and offered $3.14 million in prize money if anyone could infiltrate Chrome OS.. No winner was announced. If you're looking for a speedy, sturdy machine and are comfortable living in the cloud, the Pixel may be for you. Overall I found this computer to be a refreshing approach to computing in the cloud, thanks to its hi-def screen and wicked fast computing power. My month with the Pixel thoroughly changed my thinking on how a computer should behave while handling my files. With the Pixel, I'm totally on cloud nine. What's been your experience with the Chromebook Pixel? Or are you considering buying one? Let us know in the comments below.","The new Chromebook Pixel boasts sturdy, Apple-like aluminum unibody design .

"(CNN) -- Animated television specials are among the most cherished holiday traditions of yuletide revelers young and old. Mention ""A Charlie Brown Christmas"" (1965), ""Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer"" (1964) or ""Frosty the Snowman"" (1969) and people light up like Charlie Brown's tree (after the kids gave it a little love), Rudolph's nose, or the hot sun that melted poor Frosty. You can thank ""Mister Magoo's Christmas Carol"" -- the first animated Christmas special -- for that holiday gooeyness. It premiered 50 years ago this month. ""Mister Magoo's Christmas Carol"" originally aired on December 18, 1962, on NBC at 7:30 p.m. For the first time since 1967, the special will air on a major network -- once again on NBC -- Saturday, December 22 at 8 p.m. ET. While the major networks have aired the aforementioned holiday staples, including ""Dr. Seuss' How the Grinch Stole Christmas!"" (1966) every year since their airdates, ""Magoo"" hasn't aired outside of syndication for 44 years. Now that ""Mister Magoo's Christmas Carol"" has hit he half-century mark, this often overlooked, underappreciated, somewhat obscure Christmas special is experiencing a renaissance of sorts. CNN spoke to animator Darrell Van Citters, author of ""Mister Magoo's Christmas Carol: The Making of the First Animated Christmas Special,"" about how ""Magoo"" paved the way for Christmas specials yet to come. ""Because this was such a huge success,"" said Van Citters, ""it inspired other people to follow in its footsteps, especially 'Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer,' which was the next one."" Van Citters couldn't pinpoint why ""Mister Magoo's Christmas Carol"" fell by the wayside, but he did note that the character began to dwindle in the years following the Christmas special. Your Christmas traditions . ""'How the Grinch Stole Christmas' had a book attached to it,"" said Van Citters, ""'Charlie Brown' had all of those books, all of those specials. These were constantly in the forefront of peoples' minds during the holidays. And 'Rudolph,' well, who doesn't know that song? Between all of these other specials getting all of this promotion, and Mr. Magoo kind of fading, it really got lost for a long time."" As far as adaptations of Charles Dickens' 1843 tale ""A Christmas Carol"" go, many have tried, many have failed, and -- arguably -- a handful have succeeded. Most people would count ""Magoo"" among the successful renditions. ""I think this is one of the stronger versions because it's quite loyal to the original,"" said Van Citters. ""They are reciting lines from the book, and on an emotional level I think it's one of the strongest -- even over live-action -- because the songs really emphasize the emotional aspect of it. They know exactly where to go to tell their story."" That's right -- ""Mister Magoo's Christmas Carol' is a musical as well as an animated special. ""To take a classic story like that,"" said Van Citters, ""and then to mix in Mr. Magoo, and then make it a musical, it's kind of a big leap. And he didn't just make it a musical; he went after the best Broadway songwriters of the time. It's one of the stronger, if not the strongest, musical interpretations of Dickens."" Composer July Styne and lyricist Bob Merrill, who were developing ""Funny Girl"" at the time, wrote the songs for ""Mister Magoo's Christmas Carol"" while ensconced at the Beverly Hills Hotel in March and April of 1962. The Styne-Merrill team created Broadway-caliber songs like ""Alone in the World"" and ""Winter Was Warm,"" which gave ""Mister Magoo's Christmas Carol"" an emotional quality which made it more theater than the cartoon it was. Cleverly presented as a play-within-a-play, the special features the character of Mister Magoo starring in a Broadway production of ""A Christmas Carol."" That little technique solved the producers' dilemma regarding whether or not audiences would buy Quincy Magoo as Ebenezer Scrooge. ""Mister Magoo had kind of changed over the years,"" explained Van Citters. ""He had started out as this crotchety old man and over the years he had become softer. [Producers] thought it would be kind of weird to put this character in a role with no explanation. Nowadays people do it routinely and you don't think twice about it, but at the time it was a big leap. Originally, Mr. Magoo was going to be in a small community theater production, but as the songs got bigger, they decided to make it a Broadway production with him as a well-known actor."" Although ""Mister Magoo's Christmas Carol"" was released on Blu-Ray/DVD as a special anniversary edition, Van Citters is the first to admit that the animation isn't what resonates with longtime fans of the special. ""The animation fills the bill, but there isn't anything in the way of nice motion or defining the characters through the way they move,"" said Van Citters. ""It's all about simply hitting their marks to tell the story. It's a little rough around the edges, but it works, too. The songs are so good that you overlook stuff like that."" Van Citters pointed out that the important thing is that the special ""has a lot of heart."" In fact, the instant the special ended on the night it premiered, producer Lee Orgel's phone rang. Walt Disney had phoned to tell Orgel how wonderful it was. Van Citters wrote about the conversation in his book. ""Let me tell you something, Lee,"" Disney told Orgel. ""Not only is this generation going to watch it, but your children, your children's children and your children's children's children will watch this show. That's how good it is."" Walt Disney's stamp of approval was the ultimate gold star. ""Here's this guy that practically invented animation as we know it,"" Van Citters told CNN, ""who takes the time out of his day to watch it and call this guy up and tell him how much he liked it."" Much to the dismay of fans, a ""Mister Magoo's Christmas Carol"" soundtrack has never been released. Plans for a storybook record were scrapped, and the audio master tapes are long gone. Van Citters said there's a chance they've simply been mislabeled and are somewhere in the vaults. ""We're still looking for them and hopefully one day there will be a CD release,"" he said. Van Citters also explained that the cast and crew had no idea that ""Magoo"" was destined to become a classic. ""Everyone who worked on this simply thought they were doing a special for that year,"" he said. ""Nobody thought it was going to last as long as it did. Everyone was surprised it did as well as it did. They were so happy with it they aired it for the next five years and it was still getting good ratings. The second year it got better ratings than the first."" The Baby Boomer fans of ""Mister Magoo's Christmas Carol"" remain dedicated to keeping their beloved special's memory alive. At a December 2009 screening at The Paley Center For Media in New York City, many of those in attendance sang along and called out lines similar to midnight screenings of ""The Rocky Horror Picture Show."" (But with far fewer fishnets, one would imagine.) ""The fans are very dedicated,"" said Van Citters. ""Those who remember it remember it very well and are very passionate about it. So it's exciting that NBC is putting it back on and it will be exposed to a whole new generation of viewers."" That whole new generation of viewers may never grasp the concept of a television event. ""It's funny, isn't it, that TV specials have kind of disappeared,"" said Van Citters. ""At one time a special was special. There used to be just three networks and when someone did something unique, everyone knew about it and they set aside time to watch it. But now we have access to everything at any time of the day, at any place in the world, and you can watch it on a postage stamp or a screen almost as big as a movie theater screen."" But back in the 1960s of course, Van Citters pointed out, if you missed your favorite Christmas special you were forced to wait for the next airing. ""You only had that one chance, and then 52 weeks later you could see it again.""","First animated Christmas special, ""Mister Magoo's Christmas Carol,"" is 50 .

"(CNN) -- A judge restored Katherine Jackson as permanent guardian of Michael Jackson's children and approved a plan to add their cousin T.J. Jackson as co-guardian during a hearing Thursday. ""It's clear to me that the children are well-cared-for by Mrs. Jackson,"" Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Mitchell Beckloff said. ""It's clear to me that they love her very much and they have substantial significant relations with T.J. Jackson and love him very much."" The decision comes in a hearing eight days after the same court suspended the family matriarch as guardian because she had been gone and out of communications with the three children for 10 days.

The initial report suggests there are ""things about T.J. Jackson that the kids can relate to,"" Beckloff said. T.J.

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Human rights groups are asking President-elect Barack Obama to pay early attention to the crisis in Sudan's troubled Darfur region, where government forces have waged a bloody war against militias that some international critics have characterized as genocide. Sudan President Omar al-Bashir has agreed to a cease-fire with rebels, which could give the U.S. an opening. ""We've seen the military surge in Iraq. We've seen the development surge that NATO's announced for Afghanistan,"" said Darfur activist John Prendergast. ""What's really needed in Sudan and the broader Horn and East Africa region is a peace surge."" Prendergast's ENOUGH organization to combat genocide is a project of the Center for American Progress, a Democratic think tank run by Obama's transition co-chairman, John Podesta. Prendergast and other Darfur activists penned a recent letter to Obama, asking him to designate a team to focus solely on the Darfur issue within the first 100 days of his administration. ""It's about putting a few people, a team of people, on the case with the objective to end the crisis in Sudan, not simply manage the symptoms through massive amounts of humanitarian aid and peacekeeping support,"" he said. Fighting in the western region of Darfur started in 2003, when rebels began an uprising and the government launched a counterinsurgency campaign. The Sudanese authorities armed and cooperated with Arab militias that went from village to village in Darfur, killing, torturing and raping residents, according to the United Nations, Western governments and human rights organizations. The militias targeted civilian members of tribes from which the rebels draw strength. In the past five years, an estimated 300,000 people have been killed through direct combat, disease or malnutrition, the United Nations said. Another 2.7 million people have been forced to flee their homes because of fighting among rebels, government forces and allied Janjaweed militias. During the presidential campaign, Obama called the crisis in Darfur ""a collective stain on our national and human conscience"" and said he would make ending it a priority on ""Day One."" Obama has promised to appoint a special envoy to deal with the Darfur issue and implementing the Comprehensive Peace Agreement, which ended the decades-long civil war between the North and South. That agreement could be a model for a peace process in Darfur, Prendergast said. Although the United States does not have to lead the peace process, it could be an active partner in the global effort to develop a strategy for getting the various parties in Sudan together, he said. ""There will be much bigger issues, much bigger fish to fry in the kitchen for the new Obama administration. No question,"" he said. ""But part of governing is walking and chewing gum and eating crackers and doing all this stuff at the same time. And we think the administration can make the creation of a sustained serious peace process for Darfur a top priority."" Obama could have an opening to make a difference in Darfur. Sudan President Omar al-Bashir has agreed to an immediate, unconditional cease-fire with Darfur's rebels, which could pave the way for international talks. Activists have called on the incoming Obama administration to strengthen the current arms embargo and continue to support investigations by the International Criminal Court into war crimes by al-Bashir, leading Sudanese officials and certain members of rebel groups. More pressure, Prendergast said, should be brought to bear on countries like China, which has vast oil interests in Sudan. During the campaign, Obama said that if elected, the crisis in Darfur would be elevated to a major issue in the bilateral U.S. dialogue with China.","Human rights activist calls for ""peace surge"" in Darfur, Sudan .

"(CNN) -- A typhoon that left at least 18 people dead and thousands displaced in the Philippines was expected to move offshore Wednesday afternoon, the state-run Philippines News Agency reported early Wednesday. A baby boy was among the dead after Typhoon Nesat -- referred to in the Philippines as Pedring -- slammed into the Philippines Tuesday, Philippine authorities said. Four people were reported killed in Metro Manila, two in Central Luzon, and one in Catanduanes, the Office of Civil Defense said. Three more were reported injured and four were missing as of Tuesday afternoon. Pedring, struck the agricultural provinces of Isabela and Aurora the hardest. But storm alerts were also issued for more than 40 other areas, including Metro Manila, the state weather bureau Philippine Atmospheric Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) said. More than 64,000 people have been affected by the typhoon, the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council (NDRRMC) said, with several thousand families now being helped in evacuation centers. More than 100 people have been rescued across the country, the NDRRMC said, many of them from boats. In Albay, in southern Luzon, more than 3,000 people were affected, the state-run news agency said early Wednesday. The storm was centered about 300 kilometers (186 miles) northwest of Baguio City, in northwestern Luzon, the state-run news agency said, citing PAGASA. As of 6 a.m. Wednesday, PAGASA said, Pedring had maximum sustained winds of 120 kph (75 mph) near the center, with gusts of up to 150 kph (93 mph) and was forecast to move west-northwest at 19 kph. On Tuesday, weather officials said the storm was packing top winds of 140 kph (87 mph). The presidential palace announced the suspension of all classes for schools and work for government agencies in Manila and other affected areas. The Philippine Stock Exchange also suspended trading. Some roads around Manila were impassable due to flooding and falling debris, including branches that had been ripped off trees. Several areas in Metro Manila and nearby provinces were without electricity as the powerful storm cut power and transmission lines. DJ Santa Ana, head of news operations at TV5 in Manila, told CNN it was likely to take some time to restore the power supply in major parts of Metro Manila. Santa Ana said people in the capital remained calm as the rain kept coming down, although one part of eastern Manila had to be evacuated because of flooding. Between a half-inch to 1 inch of rain an hour is forecast within the 650 km diameter of the typhoon, state forecasters said. CNN iReporter Sherbien Dacalanio said power was out in some parts of Quezon City for hours. Several restaurants had to close down because of the high winds and many people did not venture out. Dacalanio said the winds had uprooted street lights and brought down trees and road signs, but that luckily there was no flooding near his home. At least 46 domestic flights were canceled and six international flights were delayed due to the storm, aviation officials said.

"(CNN) -- Most Americans don't think that midterm elections really matter. The majority of voters come out only for presidential elections. Midterms are left to the most activist parts of the population, the people who like to follow politics in off hours and who care as deeply about who wins elected office as they do about sports teams or celebrities. That's a big mistake. Midterms play a huge role in shaping American politics, and this year's could be especially significant. Traditionally, the party of the president does poorly. The 1938 midterm elections created a conservative coalition of southern Democrats and Republicans that stifled Franklin Roosevelt and subsequent Democratic presidents for decades to come. The 1958 midterms emboldened Northern liberals to push a new agenda, while the 1966 midterms killed any remaining momentum Lyndon Johnson had for his Great Society. In 1994, Republicans reshaped the discourse of Washington by taking control of Congress, while Democrats put a kibosh on President George W. Bush's initiatives when they took it back in 2006. This year, the stakes are big. While Republicans will certainly retain control of the House, it is unclear whether Democrats will continue to control a majority of the Senate. The importance of this outcome is enormous and will have huge consequences in the coming two years. Why does control of the Senate matter so much, especially in an era where Congress seems so gridlocked that it can't accomplish anything? The most important reason is that the Senate Democratic majority is the only effective counterweight to the immense power that the tea party Republicans can wield within the House Republican Caucus. House Speaker John Boehner has proved repeatedly that he is unable to control the 25 to 30 members of his caucus who have continued to push the party sharply to the right and who have refused to enter into any kind of compromises with the Democrats on matters such as immigration. Impotent as a leader, Boehner has ironically depended on his ability to tell colleagues that they are wasting their time in the House if they adopt tea party positions that the Senate Democrats won't accept. If Republicans gain control of the Senate in November, he won't have that check to point to anymore and we can see the GOP shift even further to the right. With control of the majority, Senate Democrats still have the power that social scientists call ""agenda setting."" Although passing legislation is obviously the prime goal of members of Congress, their other function is to get issues on the table and ensure that public debate continues on key problems. By doing that, they can keep legislative proposals alive and when the right moment hits, usually some kind of crisis, their proposals are ready to go forward. Immigration reform would likely have withered on the legislative vine of gridlock had not Senate Democrats sent the House a comprehensive reform bill and kept pressure on the lower chamber to deal with the issue. Immigration reform is dead for the rest of the Congress, but it is an issue people are still talking about and proposals will be back on the table if Democrats have their say about it. A Senate majority is also key to the future of the courts. Senate Democrats scored a huge victory when they changed the rules so that the minority could not filibuster against judicial and executive appointments (other than the Supreme Court). This has already streamlined the appointment process and resulted in a burst of nominations being confirmed. In coming years, we're likely to see numerous court battles, including the replacement of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg if she retires. Ginsburg is a vital liberal voice on a Supreme Court that has proved to be increasingly conservative. If Republicans gain control of the Senate, the White House will be in big trouble with its appointments. Republicans will be able to block ratification of a strong progressive nominee and the White House would find itself under enormous pressure to move toward the center in choosing appointments if they are going to have a chance of confirmation. Control over the Senate also matters because it will be one of the first major stories of the 2016 election campaign for the White House. If Republicans gain control of the Senate, it will spark a conversation about 2016 that begins with talk of how Democrats have become weaker politically as a result of Obama's troubles and how Republicans -- despite all their own approval rating problems -- are on the upswing. This would certainly provide a boost to their party and a good framework for Republican presidential nominees to start their campaigns. If Democrats retain control of the Senate, it would have a very different effect. The storyline for the 2016 election would begin with the ability of Democrats to check the Republican resurgence. The Republican civil war would become more intense, with the right blaming the party's establishment for crushing more conservative candidates in the primaries and the establishment blaming the right for forcing candidates to take positions that are politically unpopular. The midterms are a big deal. What happens to the Senate will play a very important role in the direction of U.S. politics in the coming years, even if Congress remains in its current dysfunctional state.

"Port-au-Prince, Haiti (CNN)  -- Rescuers were still finding survivors trapped in the ruins of collapsed buildings in earthquake-ravaged Haiti on Wednesday, and relief officials said efforts to get aid into the hands of survivors were improving. A magnitude 5.9 aftershock rattled Port-au-Prince early Wednesday, the strongest since the original 7.0-magnitude quake struck January 12, the United States Geological Survey reported. Meanwhile, complaints about bottlenecks that have hindered the delivery of food, water and medicine to survivors persisted even as U.S. and U.N. officials said the effort has begun to make progress. ""There's big success in getting things into the port,"" said Steve Hollingworth, chief operating officer of CARE. ""The real challenge now is following through and having a series of successful distributions going on all over the country, and that's a challenge for a lot of reasons."" Wednesday's aftershock was centered about 35 miles (60 kilometers) west-southwest of Port-au-Prince, and about 6.2 miles (10 kilometers) deep, according to the USGS. Patients at a hospital near Haiti's airport in the capital Port-au-Prince immediately started praying as the ground shook like a ship rocking back and forth. They asked for forgiveness and protection, a nurse there said. An aftershock that size can pose significant danger in an area where buildings already are damaged -- and one nonprofit organization, Save the Children, said its staff ""heard already-weakened structures collapsing"" as a result of the aftershock. Engineering team heads to check buildings . Haiti's government put the confirmed death toll at more than 72,000 on Tuesday, with other estimates ranging as high as 200,000. The confirmed toll already puts Haiti's quake among the 10 deadliest of the last century, according to USGS figures. iReport: Search list for the missing and found . But survivors were still being discovered in the rubble of homes and other buildings in Port-au-Prince. A 5-year-old boy named Monley was pulled alive from a collapsed home on Wednesday and was taken to a hospital to be treated for severe dehydration. His mother was killed and his father is missing, but doctors attributed Monley's survival to resilience and the strength of his young body. Relatives found the boy in a void beneath the ruins of his house as they searched for his father, his uncle said. Four of the uncle's friends helped pull the boy out as he cried out, over and over again, ""I'm thirsty."" Others reported that the few signs of survivors in the wreckage of the Hotel Montana were fading Wednesday. Some faint knocking that had lasted until early Wednesday morning stopped after the latest tremor, rescuers on the scene said. The hotel, located in the more affluent suburb of Petionville, was popular with tourists and visiting officials. In all, international rescue teams totaling about 1,700 people have rescued 121 people, the United Nations said. But about 3 million people -- nearly a third of the Haitian population -- were still in need of food, water, shelter and medical assistance Wednesday, the United Nations estimated. The aid effort has frustrated some, with a few organizations charging that bottlenecks at the airport and mismanagement in other areas have hampered efforts to get help to the 2 million residents in Port-au-Prince who need it. ""It's very frustrating that it takes so long to get as many supplies, doctors and hospitals that are needed,"" John Holmes, the U.N. emergency relief coordinator, told CNN's ""American Morning."" Are you there? Share your images, video . ""But again, I think we're making progress,"" Holmes said. ""I think there is a major issue here of people with those injuries who got infected wounds, who need operations, who are not getting as many as they can. That's the major priority for the next few days."" But Hollingworth said the devastation in Haiti was ""so profound"" that ""I'm personally getting more and more concerned by the day."" ""This has been a major body blow to Haiti, and, you know, we're in now the second week of the response,"" he said. ""The international community really is mobilizing very quickly, but the devastation has been so profound here, and it's hit in such critical areas for the country that I'm getting worried."" Impact Your World . A leading relief agency, Doctors Without Borders, has complained that the bottlenecks are costing lives. The group has blamed five deaths on the delays so far, telling reporters that flights carrying drugs, surgical supplies and dialysis machines have been diverted from Port-au-Prince to the neighboring Dominican Republic three times since Sunday, and injured at some sites may face a 10- to 12-day wait for full treatment. More than 25 countries have contributed money, goods or people to the relief effort, while U.S. private donors have given more than $275 million. Among them were President Obama and first lady Michelle Obama, who contributed $15,000 to the Clinton Bush Haiti Fund. At least 11,000 U.S. troops are now in Haiti or on ships nearby, and the military said Wednesday that it plans to send an additional 4,000 sailors and Marines from the USS Nassau Amphibious Ready Group to Haiti. Full coverage | Twitter updates . In an effort to open the flow of aid, Pentagon officials said they have obtained landing rights at the Dominican Republic's air base at San Isidro, about 150 miles (241 kilometers) east of Port-au-Prince. In addition, Washington is dispatching a ship equipped with cranes that could get the port of Port-au-Prince back into operation ""within a week or two, perhaps,"" Defense Secretary Robert Gates told reporters Wednesday during a visit to India. See the latest updates . Canadian troops are working to open an airfield in the southern city of Jacmel by Thursday, Canadian Defense Minster Peter Mackay announced in a statement from Ottawa, Ontario, and two warships are landing supplies by sea. But while those efforts are being stepped up, scenes of desperation persisted around the capital. At the city's municipal nursing home, where six people died, the remainder of the elderly patients were outside. Many suffer from terminal illnesses or dementia, and the only doctor treating them was a volunteer who showed up Tuesday, CNN's Gary Tuchman reported. Watch how there is no plan to help the nursing home patients . Some parts of the city were home to scenes of ""madness,"" CNN's Ivan Watson reported. At the port, thousands of people lined a wharf where they had been sleeping for days, desperate to catch a ferry that the government had promised would give free passage to another port 100 miles west of the capital. When the ferry appeared, they jumped into wooden rowboats, overloading them, and swarmed the ship, passing their children up and climbing aboard themselves. The owner told Watson the boat's capacity was 600. Many more tried to board for the trip, ignoring the fact that the boat held few life vests and fewer lifeboats. Watch as Haitian try to flee the devastation . One ship that did arrive Wednesday was the American hospital ship USNS Comfort -- a seagoing, 1,000-bed hospital that could give a boost to overloaded hospitals and clinics. Capt. Andy Johnson, its medical operations director, said the Comfort expects to handle a minimum of 100 patients a day, the vast majority of them with orthopedic injuries suffered in collapsed buildings. The first two patients taken on board, flown to the ship before it reached Haitian waters, were a 6-year-old boy with a crushed pelvis and 20-year-old man with a broken skull and possibly fractured cervical vertebrae. Cmdr. Tim Donahue, the ship's lead surgeon, said many of the staff have experience treating severe injuries among veterans of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. ""They're not shocked by what they're seeing,"" Donahue said. ""It's very routine for them."" The ship carries 40 doctors, including 13 surgeons, and enough medical supplies to operate for 60 days. Its total medical staff of nearly 550 will be joined by another 350 people once the ship reaches Haiti, according to the U.S. Southern Command. More than a week after the devastating earthquake, efforts to get hospitals back into working shape were seeing some results, but the injured were still streaming in. Donahue said the number of people still emerging alive from collapsed buildings was surprising. ""We shouldn't expect to see people still around,"" he said. ""It speaks to how resilient the human body is."" CNN's Karl Penhaul, Alec Miran, Eric Marrapodi and Justine Redman contributed to this report.","U.S. military plans to send 4,000 additional U.S. service members to Haiti .

"Bangkok, Thailand (CNN) -- At least 28 people were injured in two explosions at an opposition rally in the Thai capital of Bangkok on Sunday, authorities said. A local journalist is among the injured, said Paradon Patthanathabut, the national security chief. The latest blasts came just two days after another pair of explosions wounded more than two dozen people at an anti-government rally on Friday. One man wounded at the protest Friday died Saturday, emergency officials said. Since demonstrations against Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra's government began in November, nine people have died and more than 450 have been wounded, according to authorities. In a bid to resolve the current crisis, Yingluck dissolved parliament last month and called for new elections to be held on February 2. But the move has done little to appease protesters. They have called on the Prime Minister to step down from her caretaker position and be replaced by an unelected ""people's council,"" which would see through electoral and political changes. The opposition Democrat Party has said it will boycott the elections. Protest leaders have said they want to rid Thailand of the influence of former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra, the older brother of Yingluck. Thaksin was ousted in a military coup in 2006 and has spent most of the time since then in exile overseas. If he returns, he risks a two-year prison sentence on a corruption conviction, which he says was politically motivated. The recent protests in Bangkok were prompted by a botched attempt by Yingluck's government to pass an amnesty bill that would have opened the door for her brother's return.","NEW: A man wounded from a blast at a protest Friday has died .

"(Mental Floss) -- Park Place, Boardwalk, and a hidden map with a secret escape route? For Allied POWs during World War II, Monopoly® games came equipped with real-life ""get out of jail free"" cards. During World War II, the British secret service hatched a master plan to smuggle escape gear to captured Allied soldiers inside Germany. Their secret weapon? Monopoly boxes. The original notion was simple enough: Find a way to sneak useful items into prison camps in an unassuming form. But the idea to use Monopoly came from a series of happy coincidences, all of which started with maps. Smooth as silk . Maps are harder to smuggle than you might think. They fall apart when wet, and they make a lot of noise when unfolded. Allied officials feared paper maps might draw the attention of German troops, so they turned to an unlikely source for help -- silk. Not only would silk maps hold up in all kinds of weather, but they'd also come with the life-saving benefit of being whisper quiet. To produce these silent maps, the Brits turned to John Waddington Ltd., a company that had recently perfected the process of printing on silk and was already manufacturing silk escape maps for British airmen to carry. What else was Waddington known for? You guessed it -- being the licensed manufacturer of Monopoly outside the United States. Suddenly, the popular board game seemed like the perfect way to get supplies inside German-run POW camps. At the time, the Nazis were hard-pressed to get provisions to their own troops, much less to the Allied soldiers they'd captured. Wishing to hide this less-than-stellar upholding of the Geneva Convention, they happily welcomed Red Cross aid packages for POWs. So throwing Monopoly games into the care kits along with food and clothing was met with little scrutiny. Monopoly was already a well-known game throughout Europe, and the German guards saw it as the perfect way for their detainees to remain occupied for hours. Community Chest . In 1941, the British Secret Service approached Waddington with its master plan, and before long, production of a ""special edition"" Monopoly set was underway. For the top-secret mission, the factory set aside a small, secure room -- unknown to the rest of its employees -- where skilled craftsmen sat and painstakingly carved small niches and openings into the games' cardboard boxes. Along with the standard thimble, car, and Scotty dog, the POW version included additional ""playing"" pieces, such as a metal file, a magnetic compass, and of course, a regional silk escape map, complete with marked safe-houses along the way -- all neatly concealed in the game's box. Even better, some of the Monopoly money was real. Actual German, Italian, and French currency was placed underneath the play money for escapees to use for bribes. Also, because of its collaboration with the International Red Cross, Waddington could track which sets would be delivered to which camps, meaning escape maps specific to the area could be hidden in each game set. Allied soldiers and pilots headed to the front lines were told to look for the special edition game if they were captured. The identifying mark to check for? A red dot in the corner of the Free Parking space. Get out of jail free . By the end of the war, it's estimated that more than 35,000 Allied POWs had escaped from German prison camps. And while there's no way to set an exact figure on it, more than a few of those escapees certainly owe their breakout to the classic board game. But despite its brave and noble role in all of it, Monopoly's heroic war deeds would go unrecognized for decades. Strict secrecy about the plan was maintained during the war, not only so that the British could continue using the game to help POWs, but also because Waddington feared a targeted reprisal by German bombers. After the war, all remaining sets were destroyed, and everyone involved in the plan, including the escaped prisoners, were told to keep quiet. In the event of another large-scale war, Allied officials also wanted to make sure the seemingly innocent board game could go back into action. Uncle Pennybags goes behind the Iron Curtain . Believe it or not, it wasn't long before Monopoly found itself in the middle of yet another international conflict -- this time defending itself from Communist leaders in Russia. Being that Monopoly is essentially a game in which one player gets rich at the expense of others becoming poor, Soviet officials had long seen the board game as an overt symbol of capitalistic frivolity and greed. So, as its popularity soared, Communists took more and more efforts to curb the enthusiasm. Cuba, the U.S.S.R., and other Eastern Bloc countries outlawed the game for fear it would corrupt the public with positive notions about a free-market economy. Soviet leaders even tried coming up with their own Marxist-themed spin-off games designed to highlight the virtues of frugality. The title of one such knockoff from Communist-era Hungary loosely translated to ""Save,"" while another in Russia had a name that roughly meant ""Manage."" But bans and spin-offs couldn't hold down the individualistic drive of the human spirit. Monopoly became an underground success, secretly coveted and played behind the Iron Curtain as a way of escaping the drudgery of Soviet life. It wasn't until 1987, four years before the collapse of the Soviet Union, that Monopoly was allowed to be legally sold there. Today, Monopoly is licensed in more than 80 countries, and no fewer than 200 spin-off versions exist. Of course, playing it in the cozy confines of your living room, it's easy to take for granted that there was a time when, to many, Monopoly was a lot more than just a game. E-mail to a friend .

"(CNN) -- Bill Murray is considered to be one of the most lovable and easy-going actors around, which makes him a perfect candidate to play ""The Jungle Book's"" happy-go-lucky bear, Baloo. According to Deadline Hollywood, Murray has signed on to portray the gentle creature in Jon Favreau's live-action version of Rudyard Kipling's ""The Jungle Book."" Originally released as an animated movie in 1967, the story tells the tale of an orphaned boy named Mowgli, who's raised in the Indian jungle by a pack of wolves.

"London (CNN) -- Five million doses of measles and rubella vaccine will be delivered to the Philippines, following a donation organized by Britain's Prince Charles. The virus has ravaged the country since Typhoon Haiyan -- known as Yolanda in the Philippines -- hit on November 8 last year, leaving more than 6,000 dead and nearly 1,800 unaccounted for. According to the Filipino Department of Health, 15,600 cases of measles were reported during the first 10 weeks of 2014, compared to just 5,863 cases during the whole of 2013. The spread of the virus has been exacerbated by mass migration, with nearly four million people displaced by the devastating typhoon, according to the country's National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council. The immunization program will be mainly targeted at children aged from nine months to five year olds who are at most risk from the epidemic: the hope is that the plan will potentially save 5,000 lives. 5 things to know about measles . Prince Charles was in India at the time when Haiyan hit the Philippines. He visited the Serum Institute in Pune, the world's largest manufacturer of measles vaccines, two days after the typhoon made landfall. It agreed to donate five million doses to the Philippines, to be delivered via International Health Partners (IHP), one of the Prince's charities. A Clarence House spokesperson said: ""The Prince of Wales was very moved when he heard about the devastation caused by Typhoon Yolanda in the Philippines, which developed during his visit to India in November 2013. ""After being informed of the offer of a donation by the Serum Institute of India to a cause of his choosing, The Prince was pleased to charge his charities, International Health Partners and the British Asian Trust, to ensure the donation would be part of the ongoing international response to Typhoon Yolanda. ""The Prince was delighted that the Serum Institute was able to make such a generous donation to this important and urgent cause, and he was very pleased that the institute and the two charities have been able to work so effectively with the Philippines Department of Health, the World Health Organization and UNICEF to bring about this agreement."" Anthony Dunnett, president of IHP said: ""The pressing need to deliver a measles vaccination program in the Philippines demonstrates the ongoing impact of Typhoon Yolanda... We are extremely grateful to our patron, His Royal Highness the Prince of Wales, for enabling this important donation."" On Wednesday, IHP signed an agreement with the Philippine government to deliver the vaccines as part of a wider immunization program in September of this year.","Measles hit the Philippines in the wake of Typhoon Haiyan .

"Mamoni Valley Preserve, Panama (CNN) -- A famed primatologist says the plight of chimpanzees helped inspire Michael Jackson to write the song ""Heal the World."" But the theme and the lyrics of the song turned out to be about a better world for humanity. ""He wrote what he told me he thought was his most powerful song ever, but it didn't end up for animals,"" Jane Goodall said in a CNN interview Thursday night. Goodall spoke exclusively to CNN in a Panamanian rain forest where she is exploring a partnership on behalf of Roots & Shoots, her global youth education program. The interview comes as a new version of the song, first released on Jackson's 1991 ""Dangerous"" album, is being recorded by a collection of artists for release in late October. Goodall became friends with Jackson about 20 years ago when he invited her to his Neverland Ranch, where ""he talked about his dreams for the place to have animals running, looking free like they would in the wild. ... It was just a very charming day, very low key, nobody else was there,"" she said. Goodall, famous for her 50 years of groundbreaking research on chimpanzees in Africa, said Jackson invited her because ""he loved what I did."" ""He loved chimpanzees,"" she said. ""He loved to watch them feeding. He liked their faces. They made him smile."" Years later, she met Jackson's chimp, Bubbles, and has visited him at his retirement refuge in Florida, she said. ""He's extremely handsome,"" she said. ""He's a beautiful, beautiful chimp. So, he was rescued in time from this life of being inappropriately dressed up and carted around like a little symbol."" Goodall, whose life has been spent understanding chimpanzees, said she found Jackson to be ""a sad person."" ""In some ways, he was like a child, and a very sweet and gentle child, and he wanted me to tell him many, many stories,"" she said. ""Stories about the chimpanzees, the forests, animals, anything. He told me he liked the way I told stories."" Goodall, who travels the world to promote protection of endangered chimps, said she had hoped Jackson would help get her message out. ""I said to him, 'You know, Michael, if you want to help, you could do a concert and give us a percentage. Or much better, write a song,' "" she said. Jackson asked her for tapes of animals in distress because ""he wanted to be angry and cry"" as he wrote the song, which became ""Heal the World,"" she said. The original CD cover notes credited Goodall for inspiring the song, she said. But, she added, the Jane Goodall Institute never saw any money from the song. Jackson later created the ""Heal the World Foundation,"" which he funded with a series of concerts. The group delivered millions of dollars of relief to children around the world.","Jane Goodall says Michael Jackson loved chimpanzees .

"Bangkok, Thailand (CNN) -- Thailand's red-shirted anti-government protesters returned to the streets of Bangkok Sunday for their first demonstration since a state of emergency was lifted last month. Police said up to 30,000 opposition supporters descended on the area they occupied during the height of the protests last year. Sunday's ""Red Shirt"" demonstrators -- so named for the color of their clothing -- demanded a thorough investigation of a deadly government crackdown in May, along with the release of protest leaders, some of whom have been held in jail on terrorism charges for months. Sunday's demonstration was largely peaceful, a police spokesman told CNN. But Red Shirt organizers say they plan to hold regular demonstrations twice a month until their demands are met. Between March and May of 2010, thousands of opposition protesters occupied parts of the shopping district in central Bangkok. For the most part, the Red Shirts were supporters of former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra, who was ousted in a bloodless military coup in 2006.  They wanted the resignation of Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva and a new general election. But their protests came to a bloody end in May.  Government troops cracked down and drove them out of their positions in the Thai capital.  Ninety-one people died and at least 1,500 others were injured in the clashes, which saw intense street battles between protesters and government troops.  More than 30 buildings -- including a bank, a police station, a local television station and Thailand's biggest shopping mall -- were set on fire. Amid the unrest, the Thai government imposed a state of emergency that put the military in charge of security.  It lasted seven months and was only lifted in December.  The prime minister has promised to hold a new election before the end of 2011. CNN's Kocha Olarn contributed to this report.","Anti-government protesters demonstrate in Bangkok .

"(CNN) -- Sunday was marked by a slew of anti-regime protests and yet more violence targeting dissenters in Syria, while outside the embattled country the leaders of the United States and Turkey discussed ways to aid the opposition. The bloodshed includes what the Local Coordination Committee of Syria, a network of opposition groups, is calling the ""Morek Massacre."" The group claimed that 11 civilians calling for the regime's ouster were murdered, among them five ""executed by firing squad."" In total, the LCC reported that at least 70 died across the Middle Eastern nation Sunday, including 17 in the province of Homs, 17 in Hama (where the town of Morek is located), 11 in Idlib, 10 in the suburbs of Damascus, nine in Daraa, five in Aleppo and one in Hasakeh. The same group also stated that such violence did not prevent demonstrations in upwards of 18 locales around Syria -- many of which it described as ""massive,"" and documented with YouTube videos. CNN cannot independently confirm reports of protests, casualties or attacks in Syria, because the government severely restricts access by international journalists. Meanwhile, U.S. President Barack Obama and Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan met Sunday to discuss how to aid the Syrian opposition and exert pressure on Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's regime to end its brutal crackdown on civilians. The meeting, which took place in Seoul, South Korea, where the leaders will attend a nuclear summit this week, was aimed at ""syncing up"" with Turkey -- a former Syrian ally -- before Istanbul hosts the next ""Friends of Syria"" meeting on April 1, a senior Obama administration official said. Obama and Erdogan expect the upcoming conference to enhance ways to provide ""non-lethal"" aid to the opponents of the Syrian regime, such as medical supplies and communications equipment, said Ben Rhodes, a U.S. deputy national security adviser. ""We cannot be spectators,"" Erdogan said Sunday after the meeting in South Korea. Erdogan said 17,000 refugees have fled from Syria to Turkey. Obama said he and Erdogan ""are very much in agreement that there should be a process"" to transition to a ""legitimate government,"" in contrast to al-Assad's current government. He also pledged to keep pursuing humanitarian aid as reports of carnage at the hands of the the Syrian regime mount daily. A key political opposition body in Syria said Sunday that in a post-Assad era, the Syrian state would be based on ""equality,"" regardless of ethnicity, religious beliefs or political affiliation. In a new charter, the Muslim Brotherhood vowed ""to protect all rights, to dispel fears, inspire trust and confidence."" Some analysts have expressed concern about what the Sunni-dominated Muslim Brotherhood might do if al-Assad's Alawite-dominated regime falls. In its announcement Sunday, the group said it is committed to ""democracy, pluralism, equality and human rights,"" as well as rejecting and fighting terrorism. The group also said every citizen should have equal rights to run for office. Sunday's announcement comes after a top defector from the Syrian military said armed rebel groups have aligned under the leadership of the Free Syrian Army. Uniting all efforts will bolster the anti-regime movement and safeguard the nation, Brig. Gen. Mustafa Sheikh said in a video posted on YouTube. The move addressed a key concern for observers of the Syrian crisis both inside and outside the country -- that armed rebel groups were disjointed and divided. ""In these critical and difficult times that our beloved country is going through, all the honorable men and women in this nation are required to work on uniting all efforts to overthrow this corrupt regime,"" Sheikh said. ""The soldiers and officers of the Free Syrian Army pledged their allegiance to protect the people and the nation."" The Syrian government routinely blames the vaguely defined ""armed terrorist groups"" for violence in the country, while most reports from inside Syria indicate the government is slaughtering civilians in an attempt to wipe out dissidents. These differing accounts were evident again Sunday of the southern city of Nawaa. The opposition Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said five defected soldiers and three members of al-Assad's security forces were killed in the fighting. The state-run Syrian Arab News Agency said ""six of the most dangerous wanted terrorists"" were killed in clashes as authorities ""stormed a den of terrorists."" Two ""competent authorities"" were also killed, the government news agency said. The United Nations estimates the Syrian conflict has killed more than 8,000 people; opposition activists put the toll at more than 10,000. On Sunday, Kofi Annan -- a former U.N. secretary-general who is now serving as a special envoy with that world body and the Arab League -- was in Moscow to seek help from longtime al-Assad ally Russia in helping bring about a cease-fire in Syria. Russia's president praised Annan's efforts and pledged to offer assistance, the state-run RIA Novosti news agency reported. ""Perhaps, it's Syria's last chance to avoid a bloody civil war. We are very hopeful that your work will have a positive result,"" President Dmitry Medvedev told Annan, according to the news agency. Syria's official news agency, SANA, stated that Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov also met with Annan. Lavrov noted support for Annan's mission, but said that mission ""requires not interfering in Syria's internal affairs and not allowing supporting only one of the conflict parties,"" according to SANA. Russia and China have blocked U.N. Security Council attempts to pass resolutions condemning the al-Assad regime. The two countries say they want the violence to stop, but would not blame the bloodshed squarely on the regime. CNN's Saad Abedine and Brianna Keilar contributed to this report.","NEW: At least 70 people are killed around Syria on Sunday, an opposition group claims .

"(CNN) -- The death of Anwar al-Awlaki deprives al Qaeda of a leading propagandist and an inspirational figure to jihadists the world over. His calm eloquence and fluent English turned al-Awlaki into a YouTube phenomenon, and his emergence as the ideological guide of al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, or AQAP, put him at the heart of one of the most dangerous terror groups on earth. Known as the ""Professor"" by the group's operatives, he also became the spiritual mentor to would-be jihadists living in anonymous suburbs half a world away. Al-Awlaki arrived in Yemen after spending much of his youth and adult life in the United States, where he studied in Colorado and was an imam at mosques in California and the Washington metro area. He even gave interviews in the aftermath of 9/11 decrying the terror attacks. But at some point he became disillusioned with his adopted country -- perhaps because of a series of encounters with U.S. law enforcement over his alleged use of prostitutes. When he left in 2002 he took a unique understanding with him of the vulnerabilities of an open society, the sentiments of American Muslims and the opportunities of social media in the 21st century. One such opportunity was online propaganda, best evidenced by AQAP's glossy periodical Inspire. The seventh edition was published this week, edited by another American jihadist in hiding in Yemen who had been attracted to the cause by al-Awlaki's teachings. That edition promised a forthcoming essay by al-Awlaki titled ""Targeting Populations of Countries at War With Muslims."" It was al-Awlaki's favorite theme. Last year he called on American Muslims to rise up against their ""oppression."" In a video released in November 2010, al-Awlaki said there was no need to a fatwa to kill Americans. ""Killing Satan does not require a fatwa,"" he said. ""We have reached with them a situation of 'Either Us Or You.'"" As always, he was careful to justify and explain his words through Quranic verses, which gave his sermons and speeches greater credibility among would-be jihadists. According to Yemeni officials, al-Awlaki had become much more radical in 2007-08. By this time he was very active on Facebook. His DVDs were being attractively packaged and sold in the West. His YouTube followers ran into many thousands. And he was in e-mail contact with extremists in the United States and the Britain. Two cases illustrate al-Awlaki's ability to attract followers online. The best known is the messages exchanged between him and U.S. Army Maj. Nidal Hasan, who is being tried for the murder of 13 people at Fort Hood in Texas. In subsequent interviews, al-Awlaki said Hasan had initiated e-mail correspondence with him in December 2008. Al Jazeera reported: ""He was asking about killing U.S. soldiers and officers,"" says al-Awlaki. ""His question was, is it legitimate"" under Islamic law. More than a dozen e-mails followed, with Hasan asking al-Awlaki about martyrdom, about when jihad is permissible (about which al-Awlaki had written volumes), the death of innocent bystanders in attacks. And after the shootings, al-Awlaki was quick to praise them. In the Al Jazeera interview, he calls the shooting ""a heroic action."" ""The operation had a military target inside America, and there's no dispute about that,"" says al-Awlaki, adding that the soldiers killed ""were prepared and equipped to fight and kill oppressed Muslims."" He also mocked U.S. intelligence for not picking up on the e-mail traffic. The other case that illustrates al-Awlaki's reach involved a British Airways employee, Rajib Karim. In February this year a British court heard that al-Awlaki and Karim had been corresponding, via heavily encrypted software, in late 2009 and early 2010. In one message purported to be from al-Awlaki, the writer made clear where his priorities lay: ""Our highest priority is the United States. Anything there, even on a smaller scale compared to what we may do in the United Kingdom, would be our choice."" Al-Awlaki clearly saw an opportunity in Karim's employment at the airline. ""I immediately wanted to contact you to tell you that my advice to you is to remain in your current position,"" al-Awlaki wrote. ""Depending on what your role is and the amount of information you can get your hands on, you might be able to provide us with critical and urgent information and you may be able to play a crucial role."" He also sought details on ""limitations and cracks"" in present airport security systems, and told Karim he should train as British Airways cabin crew if possible. Al-Awlaki then asked, ""Did any of the (brothers) you mentioned get training on X-ray machines or understand their limitations?"" Through the East African embassy attacks, the Bali resort attacks of 2002 and most obviously the 9/11 attacks, the al Qaeda of Osama bin Laden had become known for spectacular simultaneous attacks aimed at mass casualties. Al-Awlaki recognized that attacks of such magnitude would be difficult to repeat given enhancements in security and intelligence gathering. He and al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula began to focus on smaller but highly disruptive attacks that would have a psychological and economic impact on the United States. Two such examples are the attempt to blow up a U.S. airliner on Christmas Day 2009 in the ""underpants bomber"" conspiracy; and the printer bomb plot from 2010. Al-Awlaki boasted about the Christmas Day plot, saying that Umar Farouk AbdulMutallab, the suspect who is now on trial, succeeded ""even though it didn't cause the killing of one single person."" ""They spent more than $40 billion, and a mujahed like Omar Farouq was able to infiltrate their security apparatus even though they claim he was under surveillance,"" he said in May 2010. Similarly, in one exchange with Karim, he asked: ""Is it possible to make false reports on security risks on airplanes and airports? Reports that would cause planes to be grounded and airports closed. ... This doesn't count for much but it does cause them some nuisance and loss."" In the last two years al-Awlaki had begun to play a more active operational role for the group, driving forward its ambitions to attack the United States. ""Let me underscore, Awlaki is no mere messenger but someone integrally involved in lethal terrorist activities,"" State Department counterterrorism coordinator Dan Benjamin warned in April. Internet communications presented as evidence during the British trial of Karim revealed al-Awlaki to be playing a key key role in handling jihadist volunteers arriving in Yemen and the key driver behind its ambition to attack the West. It is possible that his departure from the scene may result in the terrorist group placing more emphasis on expanding its sphere of influence in Yemen, though Western counterterrorism officials will be concerned the group may launch a revenge attack. As he became more prominent -- and more closely associated with the operational side of al Qaeda -- al-Awlaki escaped at least two attempts to kill him. The first was at the end of 2009, when a cruise missile struck a compound in a remote part of Yemen. More recently, an attack on a convoy in southern Yemen, believed to have been carried out by drones, killed several al Qaeda operatives but al-Awlaki again escaped injury. The inability of the Yemeni or U.S. governments to capture or kill him had begun to add to his mystique. ""I move freely in Yemen,"" he said in March 2010. ""There is a support among my tribesmen. ... Even though they know they are in danger, they welcome me and greet me because they are righteous people."" No longer. We may never know whether one of these ""righteous people"" betrayed him or whether other intelligence finally led to his death, but al Qaeda has lost one of its principal flag-bearers.","Al-Awlaki was at the heart of one of the most dangerous terror groups on earth .

"(CNN) -- A cargo train with stowaway migrants on board derailed in southern Mexico on Sunday morning, killing five people and injuring 17 more, officials said. At least 250 Honduran migrants were traveling on the train when it derailed, the government of Mexico's Tabasco state said in a statement. Rescuers were at the scene in a remote area of the state on Sunday, civil protection officials said. Photos showed overturned train cars and injured victims on the tracks. Eight cars overturned in the derailment, which happened around 3 a.m. in the municipality of Huimanguillo. The train's engine and first car stayed on the tracks, allowing authorities to use them to transport injured victims to a regional hospital, officials said. The locomotive derailed after heavy rains in the area softened the earth around the tracks, state officials said. In addition to the hundreds of stowaway migrants aboard, CNN affiliate FOROtv reported the train was carrying scrap metal. Mexico no longer has a nationwide passenger rail system, but thousands of Central American migrants hitch rides on freight trains heading north toward the United States. On the train, nicknamed ""The Beast"" and ""the train of death,"" they often huddle on rooftops and cram into spare spaces between cars. All of those who died or were hospitalized after Sunday's derailment are Honduran, officials said. El Salvador's foreign ministry said consular officials were heading to the area to help any Salvadorans who may have been injured. Mexican Foreign Minister Jose Antonio Meade said in a Twitter post that officials are communicating with authorities in Central America over the derailment and offering assistance to injured victims. Representatives from the private railway company that operates the cargo train route could not be immediately reached for comment.

"Port-au-Prince, Haiti (CNN) -- A nation of desperate and grieving people showed the fervency of their faith Saturday in this earthquake-ravaged capital. They mourned an archbishop, prayed in an open-air revival and, later in the day, witnessed a miracle. In a somber ceremony, Haitians turned out for a funeral Mass for the archbishop of Port-au-Prince, whose body had been recovered from rubble near the landmark national cathedral. They buried Monsignor Joseph Serge Miot at Lilavois Cemetery. Not far away, in a central city refugee camp, Marielourde Meridier hoisted her arms skyward, shook her head from side to side and shouted out the word ""Grace!"" Beside her, daughter Lovencia, 6, washed her dust-caked and scarred feet, her little head bandaged tightly to heal wounds from the crashing concrete. Meridier was thankful. Of her five children, only one was hurt badly enough to go to a hospital. Now, she relied on her faith to get her through. In the Champs de Mars plaza, which has become a makeshift settlement for earthquake victims, Haitians gathered for what they called a day of redemption. Pastor Gregory Toussaint of the Tabernacle of Glory Church in Miami, Florida, who helped organize the event, said that those who suffered when the Earth shook wanted to ask for God's forgiveness. From 6 in the morning to 6 at night, they prayed. Some blamed themselves for drawing the ire of God. Others came to openly give thanks. Thousands together. Together in their suffering. Together in their faith. The stench of human waste mingled with fumes from hot grease. Women fried fish patties and sausage while a long line formed for people to get up on stage with the pastor. The Earth's convulsions rendered hundreds of thousands of Haitians homeless. Many settled in more than 200 open spaces around the capital. These camps are known as tent cities, but that's a generous description. Only a few -- the lucky ones -- possess a tent or plywood or plastic sheeting. Many endure the stinging tropical sun all day long. Near the Champs de Mars plaza, Port-au-Prince's national cathedral lay in ruin, its architectural grandeur reduced to a heap of mangled concrete and metal and shattered stained glass. Other churches, too, were silenced by nature, but parishioners have hardly gone quiet. The sound of song and ""amens"" filled the square. Junior Rosier said the people around him differed on why the quake crushed them. ""You know, many of these people blame themselves for what happened,"" he said. ""We all have our opinions. But prayer is a great thing. Because we survived."" Rosier lost his elder brother Fednel when his home was destroyed. He has been living in the Champs de Mars tent city since the 7.0-magnitude quake leveled this city. He had been teaching at Bright English School that wretched day; many of his students did not make it out alive. Across the street from the plaza, a long line snaked along a footpath. It was the first day since the quake that banks opened for business in this city. With wallets as empty as their bellies, some people arrived as early as 5 a.m. to make sure they would be able to get through the door. Berette Rodolph was not so sure. He still had half a block to go near closing time. ""They said they are closing at 3,"" he said. Sweat and desperation covered his face. ""I have zero. They must let me in."" His voice was drowned out by the prayers in the plaza. At the sound, a smile bloomed on his face. Then, within hours, a miracle materialized elsewhere. A 24-year-old man was pulled from the rubble of Hotel Napoli Inn. Buried for 11 days, he was alive. The chief of the rescue team pointed upward and said three words. ""This is God.""

"(CNN) -- More than 30 years after her frantic cries of ""a dingo's got my baby,"" an Australian coroner has ruled that the words Lindy Chamberlain-Creighton screamed that night were true. Azaria Chamberlain was just two months old when she disappeared from her family's tent at a public campsite near Uluru, also known as Ayer's Rock, in Australia's Northern Territory. Speculation about what happened to Azaria polarized public opinion in Australia and became the subject of a 1988 feature film ""A Cry in the Dark"" starring U.S. actress Meryl Streep. Thirty-two years after losing her daughter, Chamberlain-Creighton sat shaking in the Darwin court Tuesday as she waited to hear the results of the fourth and now final inquest into Azaria's death. ""Shortly after Mrs Chamberlain placed Azaria in the tent, a dingo or dingoes entered the tent, took Azaria and carried and dragged her from the immediate area,"" said coroner Elizabeth Morris. ""It it is clear that there is evidence that in particular circumstances a dingo is capable of attacking, taking and causing the death of young children,"" she added. Coroner rules dingo to blame for Australian baby's death . Outside the court, Chamberlain-Creighton said her family was ""relieved and delighted to come to the end of this saga. ""We live in a beautiful country but it is dangerous and we would ask all Australians to be aware of this and take appropriate precautions and not wait for somebody else to do it for them,"" she added. The official finding that a dingo -- a type of wild dog -- killed Azaria ends a legal battle that has been fought over four inquests, a murder trial, through Federal and High Court appeals and a judicial inquiry. Until Tuesday, questions had remained over the cause of Azaria's death, despite a 1988 ruling quashing Chamberlain-Creighton's conviction and life sentence for her daughter's murder. Turning to address the family directly, Morris said: ""Please accept my sincere sympathy on the death of your special and loved daughter and sister Azaria. ""I'm so sorry for your loss. Time does not remove the pain and sadness at the death of a child,"" she added, her voice straining with emotion. Stuart Tipple, the lawyer who has represented the couple throughout their ordeal, described the atmosphere inside the court as ""electric."" ""When the coroner extended her sympathy and broke down herself I don't think there were too many dry eyes,"" he said. When the Chamberlains left the court room they were given a standing ovation, he added, and later outside they were applauded by the waiting press. ""I've never seen that done before. I thought that really indicates how the tide has changed."" Everything changed for Lindy and Michael Chamberlain on the night of August 17, 1980. Court documents stated, Lindy, then 32, left the campsite barbecue to put her daughter and six-year-old son Aiden to bed in the family tent where her other son, four-year-old Reagan, was already asleep. According to her testimony, Lindy tucked Azaria into her bassinet before going with Aiden to the car to get some baked beans after he complained that he was hungry. ""There is no doubt that she did return to the barbecue area, accompanied by Aiden and carrying the tin of beans and a tin opener, about five or ten minutes after she had left. She seemed normal and quite composed. No one saw any blood on her clothes or her person,"" the court documents read. It was during her absence from the barbecue that the prosecution alleged Chamberlain-Creighton slit her baby's throat with a pair of scissors before hiding the body, possibly in a camera bag. She was alleged to have buried the body later near the campsite with the help of her husband Michael. He was charged with being an accessory to murder after the fact in a conviction that was later quashed. Outside the court Tuesday, Michael Chamberlain declared, ""The truth is out.""

"(CNN) -- Washington's relentless focus on crisis tends to cloud its ability to see great opportunities. With more than 40 African heads of state coming to Washington this week for three days of meetings with President Barack Obama, Cabinet officials, members of Congress and American business leaders, the United States has a real opportunity to jump-start what has been a slow evolution in the way we have engaged with Africa. It's an opportunity that should not be missed. Foreign assistance is no longer America's primary export to Africa, and our engagement needs to change, too. The U.S.-Africa Leaders Summit is an opportunity to showcase and strengthen a relationship that is evolving dramatically on economic, security and development fronts. This will be the United States' first African heads-of-state summit, which puts us well behind our global competitors. China, which surpassed the United States as Africa's largest trading partner five years ago, has held five summits with African heads of state since 2000. The Chinese have seen plainly what many U.S. businesses have not: That six of the world's 10 fastest-growing economies over the past decade were in sub-Saharan Africa. Since 2000, Chinese exports to Africa have outpaced American exports at a ratio of 3 to 1, and China is now Africa's largest trading partner. When China wants something from an African government -- mining rights or port exclusivity, for example -- it offers no-strings-attached ""gifts"" or investments in infrastructure. While the United States offers values-driven policy and investments in people, especially in public health, the Chinese have a reputation for paying for the friendship of African governments with low-interest financing of construction projects. U.S. foreign direct investment in Africa still outstrips the Chinese, but in trade and export sales to Africa, the Chinese have eclipsed us. For the United States to continue competing, our relationship with African governments and businesses must evolve to include more meaningful and mutually beneficial partnerships. The summit's business forum on Tuesday will put American CEOs at the table with African heads of state and business leaders. This is matchmaking, with an eye on increasing U.S. exports to Africa's rapidly growing middle-class consumer base. Opinion: What Obama can do about Ebola . American CEOs want new markets for their products, and American workers want jobs making those products. African leaders want more international companies to sell their products in their countries, invest in their growth and partner with local businesses. The opportunity for increased trade and investment is extraordinary and important for the evolution of the United States' relationship with the continent. We can and should exercise our unique competitive advantages. The United States boasts an African diaspora drawn here by American universities and steeped in American culture and entrepreneurship, and a level of technology, innovation and quality that still commands the attention of African leaders, consumers and countries. The U.S. has a unique opportunity to build bridges to emerging economies and democracies in Africa through the tens of thousands of Africans in our country who are a part of the diaspora. Doctors. engineers and businessmen, educated here and successful here, can connect the United States to Africa in ways China, Russia and India simply cannot. After 50 years of President John F. Kennedy's Peace Corps, a decade of President George W. Bush's transformational campaign to prevent and treat HIV/AIDS, and with the promise of President Obama's Power Africa electrification initiative, the United States is better regarded in Africa than anywhere in the world. I saw this firsthand as a student in Kenya in 1984 and have experienced it consistently in visits since. We should build on the positive view of America and Americans created by the remarkable generosity of our investments in health, education, clean water and good governance to shift our engagement strategy from aid to trade. China, Russia, Brazil and India are focused on the huge potential of Africa because of the increase in the number of stable and growing countries on the continent. While the bad news from a handful of countries dominates American news, the quietly good news about growth and opportunity in dozens of others is overlooked. To its credit, the Obama administration has noticed. Delegations led earlier this year by the secretaries of commerce and energy, the President's remarkable Young African Leaders Initiative, and the administration's Power Africa are all meaningful steps forward. Congress can do its part by strengthening and reauthorizing the African Growth and Opportunity Act before its authorization expires next year. The real success of Obama's summit won't come in the form of a joint press statement or vague declaration of a path forward but in new contracts between U.S. companies with African partners and new commitments from African leaders. Twenty years ago, every American company was deciding whether to take the risk of investing in and engaging in the newly opening markets of Asia, and China ended up being the dominant opportunity of the region. Today, no competitive company is without some role in China. Africa will emerge as the next great growth market and opportunity of the 21st century, and China will not miss ""the next China."" America shouldn't either. Join us on Facebook.com/CNNOpinion.","More than 40 heads of state attend first Africa summit in the U.S. this week .

"(EW) -- How on earth is a movie about James Brown rated PG-13? The Godfather of Soul not only oozed sin and raw sexuality from the stage, but his life off it was one long rap sheet of domestic-violence charges, blackout drug benders, and indiscriminate gunplay. To be fair, all of this is touched on in Tate Taylor's (""The Help"") biopic of the Hardest Working Man in Show Business â€” but with kid gloves. ""Get On Up"" too often plays it safe when it needs to be dangerous. 'Get On Up' trailer: The evolution of James Brown . It doesn't help that writers Jez and John-Henry Butterworth chronologically pinball around like Ritalin-starved kids, never trusting the audience to take in the full sweep of the R&B singer's life. In the opening reel alone, the film jumps from 1988 (a high-speed chase with the cops that resulted in jail time) to 1968 (performing under fire in Vietnam) to 1939 (his impoverished Georgia childhood). The best thing the movie has going for it is Chadwick Boseman's live-wire channeling of Brown. With his gravity-defying pompadour, raspy jive patter, and quicksilver shimmy-slide dance steps, the ""42"" star sweats through a two-hour funk workout, belting ''Caledonia,'' ''Night Train,'' and ''It's a Man's Man's Man's World.'' How Chadwick Boseman went from playing Jackie Robinson to James Brown . In the most poignant scene, Viola Davis, as the mother who abandoned Brown, shows up backstage to leech off his wealth and fame. Both she and Boseman are devastating.

"(CNN) -- It's been a decade since the tragic death of R&B star and budding actress Aaliyah Dana Haughton. Just 22 years old at the time of her death, she was in the Bahamas heading back to the States after wrapping up her 2001 music video, ""Rock The Boat."" The twin-engine plane crashed shortly after takeoff. Aboard were Aaliyah and eight others -- including her hair stylist, Eric Forman, makeup artists Anthony Dodd and Christopher Maldonado, security guard Scott Gallin, video producer Douglas Kratz, Blackground Records employees Keith Wallace and Gina Smith, and the pilot, Luis Morales III. In an instant their lives and Aaliyah's promising career were gone. Born in Brooklyn and raised in Detroit, she quickly garnered a fan base in the early '90s with her original take on R&B music. Working with industry greats like Missy Elliott, Timbaland, R. Kelly and more, she topped the charts with a slew of hits, including ""Back & Forth,"" ""Age Ain't Nothin' But a Number,"" ""Are You That Somebody"" and ""We Need A Resolution"". Aaliyah's standout fashion sense made her a hot commodity among the fashion crowd: She modeled for Tommy Hilfiger, who showcased her tomboy appeal -- baggy jeans and a tight-fitting shirt -- and was featured on the covers of many magazines with that trendsetting hair swoop over her left eye. Her influence on the music game is still relevant today. She has inspired artists from singer-rapper Drake to pop superstar Beyonce. Ciara, who is best known for her singing and dancing moves, has an Aaliyah-inspired stage presence and dressing style. Singer-songwriter Tank, who worked closely with Aaliyah on her last two albums, spoke with Concrete Loop earlier this year about where she would be right now if she were alive. ""She would be at the top and there would probably be a few people who wouldn't have careers,"" he said. If you think about it, she was already on top. At the time of her death, she had three top-selling albums under her belt, many nominations and awards and was slated to have a big role in ""The Matrix Reloaded"" and ""Matrix Revolution"" movies. She had just completed her work on the film, ""Queen of The Damned"" and was already being sought after for other movie roles. Not to mention, she had a solid and loyal fan base. However, the rest of her journey to superstardom just wasn't meant to be. A month before her untimely death, Aaliyah granted MTV's show ""Diary"" behind-the-scenes access to her fast-paced life and said, ""I am truly blessed to wake up every morning to do something that I love; there is nothing better than that."" She continued, ""Everything is worth it -- the hard work, the times when you're tired, the times when you are a bit sad. In the end, it's all worth it because it really makes me happy. I wouldn't trade it for anything else in the world. I've got good friends, a beautiful family and I've got a career. I thank God for his blessings every single chance I get."" So, on August 25, blast Aaliyah's timeless music loud and remember her for being a trendsetting force in fashion and for helping to redefine and take R&B music to another level.","Born in Brooklyn and raised in Detroit, Aaliyah quickly garnered a fan base in the '90s .

"(CNN) -- With Walter White dead, fans everywhere are mourning, celebrating, tallying up bets and discussing what just happened. Was the series finale of ""Breaking Bad"" satisfying? Did it tie up all loose ends? Did the character you wanted to live survive and did the ones you wanted to die get their just deserts? Is it sending you back to the beginning to binge watch it all over again? Just when it seemed Walt was heading out of his New Hampshire hideaway to exact revenge on Elliot and Gretchen Schwartz (for dismissing his involvement with Gray Matter Technologies in the episode previous), he pulled the first of several surprises of the evening. Instead of threatening to kill them outright, he asks them to set up a trust fund so that his children would benefit from the money he'd illegally amassed (presumably the goal of his entire meth enterprise to begin with). Gretchen and Elliott of course are terrified by his sudden appearance in their ritzy new home, but had they been paying attention, they would have seen Walt waltz on in. His entrance is a bit ironic, considering their wealth and legitimacy is in some way a result of his earlier contributions. He's always been there, in the shadows, whether they acknowledged him or not. Bryan Cranston, man of the moment . Walt wants them to ""make it right,"" but of course, he knows he can't trust them to take care of his kids on a handshake alone, so he brought backup -- two ""hitmen"" who shine sniper-style red lights on the Schwartzes to lend credibility to Walt's threat that if for any reason his children don't receive the money, ""a kind of countdown begins,"" in which they would be killed. It's a bluff, but they don't know that, so it's a win-win. Walt's children will get the money in a semi-legal fashion, and no one will actually die in the process. That's not to say Walt's above taking a life or two (or more) on his way out. As he progresses down the list of necessary showdowns, Walt crashes a regularly scheduled meeting with Todd and Lydia (""10 a.m., every Tuesday"") and slips a little something extra in Lydia's morning coffee via what she thinks is her favorite sugar substitute Stevia -- actually the long-awaited use of his ricin, made back in season four. With the lingering close-up on her cup, we know long before she starts getting flu-like symptoms that she's doomed. There's no antidote. And it's been inevitable for a long time that Walt would finally successfully use the ricin on somebody, it was just a question of how and when. By the time Lydia realizes that her humidifier is not enough, she's only got about one day left to live. 'Breaking Bad' creator signs deal for CBS drama . Thinking that Jesse has partnered with the neo-Nazis, Walt preps for his ultimate showdown, but he has one last detour to make -- to see his wife Skyler and their kids. ""I needed a proper goodbye,"" he tells her, after it's revealed he evaded her police protection and slipped in her new home as well. She refuses his money, and he gives her the lotto ticket with the coordinates of where Hank is buried, of where his money used to be. ""If I have to hear one more time that you did this for the family,"" she starts, before he finally tells the truth: ""I did it for me. I liked it. I was good at it. And I was alive."" He gets a glimpse of Holly and Flynn, but he has one last threat to take care of, so that men in masks don't come and threaten his family anymore in the night. Walt must have known that he wouldn't leave this last altercation alive, but once he realized that Jesse was not a partner but a prisoner of the neo-Nazis, he does his last good deed, and protects Jesse from the barrage of machine gun fire set to emanate from his trunk, throwing him down on the ground just below the firing line. And finally, it comes down to the two of them. Walt puts down his gun, and Jesse picks it up. Opinion: 'Breaking Bad' is watching you . ""Do it,"" Walt tells him. ""You want this."" ""Say you want this,"" Jesse demands. ""Nothing happens until I hear you say it."" ""I want this,"" Walt concedes. And then Jesse drops the gun and tells him, ""Then do it yourself."" After all the grief and pain of their partnership, Walt and Jesse don't kill each other. They don't hug it out. They leave each other with a nod and a semi-smile, and poor scarred and tortured Jesse presumably gets to go and actually have a life. (Maybe with Brock? The kid needs a parental figure, stat). Chemistry is the study of transformation, as ""Breaking Bad"" has repeatedly reminded us. Mr. Chips turned into Scarface-level meth kingpin and died of a gunshot wound from his own device, as police arrived to arrest him for his many crimes. Was Walt always Heisenberg? Was Heisenberg only a creation out of necessity? Would Walt have allowed Jane to die if his criminal enterprise were not threatened? Would Walt have poisoned a child if he didn't need to take down a major rival? And is his death ""justice?"" AMC fix for 'Breaking Bad' addicts: 'Better Call Saul' We've all seen Walter White's death coming. It was merely a question of whether his cancer or his criminal activity would get him first. With Walt coughing all the way, we've had ample warning. This antihero was not long for this world. It took five seasons, but in Walt's world, it was two years, two long years in which a baby was born, a psychopath was made, a DEA agent finally saw the light (albeit too late) and a mild-mannered chemistry teacher learned what it took to make him feel alive. Of course, not every loose end is tied off, but for now, it's enough. That is, until the inevitable ""Better Call Saul"" spinoff.","Walter White made several surprising moves in the finale .

"(CNN) -- Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg's latest headline-making action is a new ""Ban Bossy"" campaign, which aims at getting rid of the word ""bossy."" Her nonprofit group, LeanIn.org, has even teamed up with big names like Beyonce and Condoleezza Rice to produce a public service announcement to stop using the word ""bossy."" In a weekend op-ed for the Wall Street Journal, co-written with Girl Scouts CEO Anna Maria Chavez, Sandberg put the word at the center of the problem of unequal treatment of girls and boys, noting that girls who lead are more often described as ""bossy"" and ""overly ambitious"" while boys who lead are described as ""strong"" and ""determined."" Sandberg raises valid points, and as a powerful woman her voice adds much to the ongoing conversation about why it's important to insist on equal treatment of, and expectations for, boys and girls, and men and women. But while Sandberg isn't wrong that ""bossy"" is disproportionately directed at girls and women, and usually with negative connotations, the problem isn't the word itself, but how and when the word is used. Ban ""bossy"" and other words will spring up in its place: ""Bitchy,"" ""cold"" and ""aggressive"" come to mind. Instead, the focus should be on how to reclaim the positive and indispensable nature of ""bossiness,"" turning it from a word used to describe the domineering and unlikable to one used to describe those very necessary qualities for those who lead. Sheryl Sandberg is bossy, and it's a quality that likely played a pretty key role in helping her become one of the technology industry's most successful women. So, how about an initiative to reclaim bossiness as a point of pride? Bosses are bossy, plain and simple. As Sandberg even notes: ""...if you look at my childhood, if you look at the childhood of most of the leaders we talked to, they lived through being told they were bossy."" And, well, look where they are now. In fact, moving to abolish the word ""bossy"" risks sending the message that there's something wrong with those characteristics associated with bossiness: taking charge and speaking your mind. Again, the problem isn't the word, or the behavior, but the reaction to the behavior, and the acceptance among women of the word as a disparaging one. There's also the very important fact that by focusing on how to foster those girls who, like Sandberg, grow up inclined to lead rather than follow—to boss—a message emerges that leadership is the only road to success. And that's just not true. Initiatives are commendable, as is any opening of dialogue. But it's hard not to interpret ""Ban Bossy"" as a reaction to the tepid response Sandberg received to her last initiative, ""Lean In,"" through which she was criticized as being too privileged to be a valid motivator. With ""Ban Bossy,"" she certainly makes an effort to position herself as among the downtrodden, one among many who've been victimized by ""the other B-word."" But there's some overreaching going on here. Let's not forget: There is evidence that girls and women aren't in fact being overlooked, or discouraged into meekness. Girls are outperforming boys in schools. More women than men are graduating college and going on to earn as much, if not more, than their male partners. Fortune's latest ranking of America's 500 largest corporations includes more female CEOs than ever. Things aren't perfect, of course, but they're getting there, as women—and men—embrace not only their bossiness, but all those other qualities that lead them to live lives that are fulfilling in any number of ways. The lesson to children, and to the parents and teachers who raise and nurture them, should be that there is pride in being opinionated, motivated and motivating—that is, bossy. There is also pride in being not-so-bossy, and in recognizing whatever other specific traits make them special, whether they go on to become leaders or not. There's a word to describe that, too: individuality. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Peggy Drexler.","Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg is launching a ""Ban Bossy"" campaign .

"Washington (CNN) -- They are mostly teenage girls, often from broken homes where no one misses them. Their world is one of drugs and abuse -- emotional and physical -- in which they are forced to sell their bodies. In announcing the FBI's latest crackdown on child prostitution, officials Monday described a dark underside of society that has grown through Internet sites that provide pimps easy access to johns in hotels, motels, at truck stops and just about anywhere else. The nationwide operation over the weekend resulted in 150 arrests, with 105 children between the ages of 13 and 17 rescued, according to Ron Hosko, assistant director of the FBI's Criminal Investigative Division. Overall, the three-day undercover Operation Cross Country took place in 76 cities and involved 230 law enforcement units, Hosko told a news conference. It was the largest such sweep to date, he said, with 28 searches and 129 seizures of cash, drugs, vehicles and firearms. Those arrested face a variety of federal and state charges, including pimping. This seventh iteration of Operation Cross Country also was the most successful, with a 30% to 40% increase in ""identifying both victims and pimps"" compared with previous operations, Hosko said. He credited the success in part to an expansion of the probe to websites such as www.backpage.com, which he called a forum ""where pimps and exploiters gather."" Watch: Fighting sex trafficking in the U.S. Authorities also have learned more about how the market thrives. For example, Hosko explained that major sporting events such as the Super Bowl and the NCAA Final Four attract tens of thousands of visitors with money who want to party, and pimps with prostitutes ready to cash in. ""We have had children recovered from each of those events, multiple children from each of those events in the past,"" he said. While technology has changes methods of procurement, the underlying demographics of the child victims of the prostitution industry remain little changed -- young girls around 13 to 16 years old with few or no family ties. FBI: Nationwide child prostitution sweep leads to 104 arrests . ""That tends to be the age that many of us as loving and caring parents occasionally find some differences with our teenage daughters, and exploiters will exploit that gap,"" Hosko said. A breakdown of cities where the latest arrests took place, and where child prostitutes were recovered, reveals some unexpected findings. The San Francisco-Oakland region in California had 17 arrests and 12 recovered child prostitutes, while Detroit, which just declared itself bankrupt, had 18 arrests and 10 rescued children. Meanwhile, New York City had none of either, Las Vegas had one of each and New Orleans had five arrests and four recovered children, compared with 13 arrests and three child prostitute rescues in Oklahoma City. ""This operation serves as a reminder that these abhorrent crimes can happen anywhere,"" Hosko said. Opinion: Sex trafficking, an American problem too . Operation Cross Country is part of the FBI's Innocence Lost National Initiative, which seeks to identify children lured or forced into prostitution and remove them from risk, according to Hosko. The circumstances of the situation make finding victims especially difficult, he explained. ""Commonly some of these children have stepped away from their families,"" he said, adding that ""there is no one to call and report 'my daughter is missing.'"" Other major problems are the culture of abuse, both physical and emotional, and the drug use prevalent in child prostitution. ""We have victims whose new normal is abuse and is drug-infected,"" Hosko said, explaining there is an environment of instability in which ""the expectation of somebody who cares about them may last for 30 minutes or an hour before the abuse starts again.""

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Michael Jackson ""clearly"" suffered from insomnia that could have been caused by Demerol, a narcotic he was getting frequently from a doctor other than Dr. Conrad Murray, according to a sleep expert testifying Thursday in Murray's involuntary manslaughter trial. Murray's defense team contends Dr. Arnold Klein injected Jackson with 6,500 milligrams of Demerol during visits to his Beverly Hills, California, dermatology clinic in the last three months of his life, and that Murray did not know about it. Jackson desperately sought sleep the day he died, worried that without rest he could not rehearse that night, which could force the cancellation of his ""This Is It"" comeback concerts, according to Murray's interview with police. Soon after he found sleep, Jackson suffered respiratory arrest and was later declared dead by an emergency room doctor at Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center in Los Angeles. Dr. Nader Kamangar, a UCLA sleep expert testifying for the prosecution, said medical records indicated Jackson's insomnia could be related to ""anxiety for performing, as well as use of drugs, medications such as Demerol."" Klein was never charged or disciplined for his treatment of Jackson, but Murray's lawyers contend that treatment addicted Jackson to Demerol and caused the insomnia that Murray was treating when Jackson died. Murray claimed the day Jackson died he was trying to wean Jackson from using the surgical anesthetic propofol to induce sleep, a treatment he gave him almost every night the previous two months. Murray told detectives that during the last morning he gave Jackson a series of three sedatives -- Valium, lorazepam and midazolam -- over a 10-hour period before finally giving in to Jackson's plea to again use propofol. ""I've got to sleep, Dr. Conrad,"" Murray said Jackson pleaded to him. ""I have these rehearsals to perform. I must be ready for the show in England. Tomorrow I will have to cancel my performance, because you know I cannot function if I don't get to sleep."" Kamangar said the combination of drugs Murray gave Jackson ""was the perfect storm"" that killed him. ""Mr. Jackson was receiving very inappropriate therapy, in the home setting, receiving very potent sedatives, including propofol, lorazepam and midazolam, without monitoring by Murray, and ultimately this cocktail was a recipe for disaster,"" Kamangar said. The trial ""will be, in all likelihood, concluding a lot earlier than we expected,"" Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Michael Pastor said at the start of the 12th day of testimony Thursday. Lawyers previously estimated it would conclude around October 28. While there will be no court Friday to allow the prosecution's expert anesthesiologist, Dr. Steven Shafer, to attend a medical convention, the end of testimony could come next week. Dr. Shafer briefly began his testimony Thursday morning before the trial was adjourned. The judge agreed to let Shafer leave for the conference in Chicago where he will present a paper on propofol. He is expected to be the next and last witness for the direct presentation of the prosecution's case against Murray. Shafer's testimony is expected to echo the opinions of Kamangar and Dr. Alon Steinberg, a cardiologist who testified Wednesday, that Murray's treatment of Jackson was so grossly negligent that it was criminal. Murray's delay in calling 911 for help as soon as he realized Jackson was not breathing may have cost the pop icon his life, Steinberg testified. He and Kamangar both presented a long list of what they said were instances of Murray's extreme deviation from the standards of medical care, including his failure to immediately call for paramedics. ""If these deviations would not have happened, Mr. Jackson would be alive,"" Steinberg testified. The Los Angeles County coroner ruled that Jackson's June 25, 2009, death was from ""acute propofol intoxication"" in combination with several sedatives, including lorazepam. Murray's lawyers contend that Jackson used a syringe to inject the fatal overdose through a catheter on his left leg while Murray was away from his bedside. They dropped the theory pushed earlier that Jackson may have orally ingested the propofol that the coroner says killed him. Murray's defense also contends that Jackson swallowed eight tablets of lorazepam, a sedative, in a desperate search for sleep the day he died. Murray should be found guilty even if jurors accept the theory that Jackson self-administered the fatal dose because the doctor was reckless in leaving propofol and lorazepam near his patient when he was not around, Steinberg testified. ""It's like leaving a baby that's sleeping on your kitchen countertop,"" Steinberg said. ""There's a very small chance the baby could fall over, or wake up and grab a knife or something."" Steinberg said he based his conclusions on Murray's own words to detectives in an interview two days after Jackson's death. That interview was played for jurors in the previous two days of the trial. Jackson would be alive today if Murray had called 911 for help within two minutes of realizing Jackson was not breathing, instead of waiting about 20 minutes before asking a security guard to call, Steinberg said. Prince Jackson disputes Murray's version of events, family says . Earlier testimony revealed Murray did ask Jackson's chef to send a security guard upstairs to help him about five minutes after the time prosecutors suggest he realized there was a problem with Jackson. The chef, however, testified that she sent Jackson's 12-year-old son upstairs instead of security. Steinberg said the use of propofol to treat Jackson's insomnia was another extreme deviation from standards that contributed to Jackson's death. He later acknowledged a recent report from China that the anesthetic had been successfully used to treat chronic insomnia, but he suggested it needed more study to be accepted. Kamangar, the sleep expert, testified that propofol has no therapeutic value in treating insomnia, and to use it is unethical and an extreme deviation from the standards of care. ""It is beyond comprehension,"" Kamangar said. ""It is frankly disturbing."" Steinberg said he based his conclusions on his belief that Murray had connected Jackson to an IV drip of propofol after he gave him an injection of propofol. That assumption, he said, was made because Murray told police he had used such a drip on most previous nights. When Flanagan challenged him to show where in Murray's police interview he said he used a drip the day Jackson died, he eventually said ""I will agree with you, it's not completely clear."" Murray said he injected a small dose of propofol using a syringe, but the prosecution contends he also used a makeshift IV setup to keep Jackson medicated and asleep. That drip may have malfunctioned while the doctor was not monitoring his patient, they contend. The prosecution has been unable to produce the tubing that would be a critical piece of an IV system, although they did show jurors an opened saline bag into which they contend Murray placed an opened propofol bottle. On the recording, Murray insisted he kept a close watch on Jackson after he finally fell asleep. The physician never mentioned the long list of e-mails and calls that cell phone records later revealed. Murray was hired as Jackson's personal physician while the singer prepared for his ""This Is It"" comeback concerts in London, planned to start in July 2009. If convicted of involuntary manslaughter, Murray could spend four years in a California prison and lose his medical license.","NEW: Dr. Klein injected 6,500 milligrams of Demerol into Jackson, the defense says .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Lawyers in the Conrad Murray manslaughter trial will take Wednesday off from court to prepare their closing arguments, a day after the doctor declined to testify in his defense in the death of singer Michael Jackson. Murray announced in court Tuesday that he will not take the stand, pausing to look at each of his lawyers for several seconds before telling the judge, ""My decision is that I will not testify in this matter."" His decision to remain silent ended the defense case in the trial of Michael Jackson's doctor, setting the stage for closing arguments on Thursday. The end of testimony was emotional for dozens of the singer's fans who converged at the Los Angeles County courthouse during the six-week trial. A fan was removed from the courthouse after yelling ""Murderer, Murderer"" at Murray as he walked down the hallway during a recess Tuesday. Fans also surrounded and yelled at defense anesthesiology expert Dr. Paul White as he waited for a cab on a courthouse sidewalk. Others lined both sides of the hallway and held hands as members of Jackson's family walked past. Parents Joe and Katherine Jackson attended court Tuesday, along with their daughter, LaToya Jackson and youngest son, Randy Jackson. As Katherine and LaToya left the courthouse, they took with them several signs used by fans in loud protests each day. Prosecutors briefly recalled their anesthesiology expert, Dr. Steven Shafer, for a rebuttal to defense propofol expert Dr. Paul White before resting their case Tuesday morning. Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Michael Pastor met with lawyers for both sides Tuesday afternoon to discuss what exhibits will be admitted into evidence and what instructions he will give jurors before they begin deliberations Thursday. The prosecution contends that Murray's use of the surgical anesthetic propofol to treat Jackson's insomnia in his home deviated from the standards of care expected of a doctor so egregiously that it made him criminally responsible for Jackson's death. Murray has pleaded not guilty. If Murray had decided to tell jurors his version of what happened the day the pop star died under his care, it would have been at the risk of intensive cross-examination by Los Angeles County Deputy District Attorney David Walgren. Walgren proved his cross-examination skills again Monday in a fiery battle with White over the defense anesthesiology expert's theory that Jackson died from drugs he gave himself. White completed his testimony Tuesday morning. White's bruises in his battle with Walgren on Monday included a contempt-of-court citation and a $1,000 fine after he ignored repeated warnings from Pastor not to refer to his personal conversations with Murray. Walgren insisted that White answer his questions based only on what he knew from Murray's interview with police, not what Murray told him privately. It otherwise would have been a way for the defense to introduce statements from the defendant without him having to testify. ""Nice try,"" Pastor told the defense as he ruled they couldn't do that. Walgren spent much of Monday trying to discredit what White said during his testimony Friday, and getting the defense expert to support the prosecution's argument that Murray's treatment of Jackson was reckless. White conceded that Murray deviated from the standards of care, but he would not agree that they were so ""egregious and extreme"" that they make Murray criminally responsible for Jackson's death. Murray's deviations were ""perhaps between minor and serious, but it's not extreme,"" he said. Walgren also was successful in getting White to agree that he would not have done what Murray did -- take the job of sedating Jackson nearly every night at home with propofol. ""No amount of money"" could get him to take the job, White said. ""Absolutely not,"" he testified. ""That would be a job I would never consider accepting."" The prosecution contends greed led Murray to leave his medical practice and put his ethics aside to serve as Jackson's private doctor for $150,000 a month. But the biggest battle between Walgren and White was fought over the competing theories of how Jackson died and the scientific evidence that supports them. The Los Angeles County coroner ruled that Jackson's June 25, 2009, death was caused by ""acute propofol intoxication"" in combination with two sedatives. White concluded that the level of drugs found in Jackson's stomach, blood and urine, convinced him that Jackson died after he rapidly injected himself with propofol on top of a large dose of lorazepam he swallowed hours earlier. Shafer, the prosecution's propofol expert, concluded the ""only scenario"" that fits the scientific evidence is that Jackson was on a constant intravenous drip of propofol for three hours before his death. Shafer also testified that Murray must have also injected Jackson with a series of large doses of lorazepam, a sedative, hours before his death. White theorized that Jackson could have ""pushed"" the drug into an catheter in his leg using a syringe over a 15- to 30-second period, much faster than a doctor would have done. ""I believe it could potentially have lethal consequences,"" White testified. Under cross-examination Monday, White said he believed Jackson used the same syringe Murray had loaded with propofol an hour earlier to give Jackson a 25-milligram injection. Murray filled it with 50 milligrams initially, leaving it half-filled in Jackson's bedroom, under White's theory. White ruled out the possibility that Murray would have injected the fatal dose unless ""he wanted to potentially harm Mr. Jackson."" Walgren asked White whether he thought Jackson intended to harm himself. ""I don't think he realized the potential danger,"" White replied. The defense contends Jackson was desperate for sleep, fearing his comeback concerts would be canceled if he missed another rehearsal from lack of rest. Walgren pressed White for an opinion about Murray's decision to leave Jackson alone with a syringe of propofol, considering he should have known Jackson had ""pushed"" a syringe of propofol before. ""No, I would not leave the room,"" he said. Prosecutors contend Murray is responsible for Jackson's death, even if he did not give him the final and fatal dose, because he was reckless in using the surgical anesthetic to help Jackson sleep without proper precautions.","Testimony ends in the trial of Dr. Conrad Murray .

"(CNN) -- The effects of l'Affaire Snowden continued to accumulate this past week with a dramatic vote in the U.S. House of Representatives. By a bare 12-vote margin, a bipartisan coalition of more or less centrist Republicans and Democrats defeated an equally bipartisan coalition of their more ideological brethren, the latter an incredibly improbable alliance that almost succeeded in defunding NSA's telephone metadata program. One Hill participant described the hours before the vote as ""hand to hand combat,"" but for now, at least, NSA will continue to acquire American telephone ""business records"" to help it detect terrorist activity in the United States. Even as Americans were focused on the fate of this program, however, lines were being drawn for future debates based on other revelations by data leaker Edward Snowden. Chief among these is PRISM, an effort probably best understood by contrasting it to the telephone metadata program. PRISM (authorized by the FISA Amendment Act of 2008) is about the content of communications, not just the fact that a communication has taken place. It deals with digital data, like e-mails, not traditional phone calls. The subjects and activities related to PRISM collection are foreign and specific, not domestic and broad as in the metadata effort. Finally, PRISM is used for a number of legitimate foreign intelligence purposes, not just counterterrorism. There are also parallels. Both programs can only work with the court-compelled compliance of electronic communication service providers. And both programs are responsive to the world in which America found itself after 9/11. The metadata program was designed to deal with the reality of potential terrorists already inside the United States. PRISM was designed to deal with changes in how modern communications are moved, stored and accessed. Take this example. NSA is targeting the communications of a known terrorist in Yemen. It discovers that the Yemen-based terrorist is communicating electronically with another individual; he could be in Pakistan, elsewhere in Yemen or even in the United States. They are using a U.S. hosted Internet service; they send e-mails back and forth. Similar contours could apply to e-mail traffic detailing the invoice of a delivery of dual use chemicals to a state suspected of developing chemical weapons. Or to another communication that provides data on the timing and routing of human trafficking in the Caribbean. In each of these cases, the only thing likely to be ""American"" about any of these communications is that they are physically in the United States and are being hosted by a U.S.-based Internet service, a phenomenon that the 1978 Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, FISA, could not have anticipated. Recognizing this, under the prodding of then-Director of National Intelligence (and former Director of NSA) Mike McConnell, Congress amended FISA in 2008 to allow NSA more speedy and effective access to these kinds of communications. Access is still overseen by the FISA court (which also compels firms to turn over requested data), but the process no longer requires the time consuming, cumbersome, individualized warrants of the past. Early Snowden-based stories here and abroad made a great deal of PRISM. Rushing against deadline, some outlets reported (inaccurately) that NSA had direct and free access to the servers of American Internet service providers, or ISPs, and it was a short step from there to near libelous accusations that the agency was routinely rummaging through the e-mails of ordinary Americans. In reality, in performing its foreign intelligence mission, NSA treats PRISM as just another SIGAD, SIGINT Activity Designator, an admittedly new and particularly valuable collection point, but still one among many designed to acquire foreign communications of foreign intelligence value. The alleged NSA slides that some have ominously included in their accounts of PRISM look far more benign to anyone experienced in signals intelligence. Indeed, if the slides are at all accurate, they look like an orientation briefing designed to show new analysts that PRISM is one tool in a large tool kit for them to use as they work to piece together actionable intelligence out of diverse, dispersed and frequently hard to acquire foreign communications. As recently as this past Sunday, however, Snowden chronicler-supporter-spokesman Glenn Greenwald was working to revive the meme of an unchecked NSA. Appearing on ABC's ""This Week,"" Greenwald described tools that allow analysts ""to listen to whatever e-mails they want, whatever telephone calls, browsing histories, Microsoft word documents."" Greenwald's accusations were sufficiently broad and breathless (even though he did at one point concede that there were ""legal constraints for how you can spy on Americans"") that the stunningly misleading lead of ABC's follow-on story was that these tools ""allowed even low-level analysts to search the private e-mails and phone calls of Americans."" Actually, if Greenwald's description of the tools themselves is correct, they are the product of a decade-plus effort at NSA to improve the analytic and collection means available to its work force, to allow NSA analysts at all levels--analysts trained annually in how to protect American privacy--to make a single query to access all relevant information across agency databases and to assign tasking across various SIGADs. Put another way, NSA can more readily connect dots (dots comprised of lawfully collected foreign intelligence) and coordinate tasking (of legitimately targeted foreign communications) than at any other time in the agency's history. And if that is true, it is something we should celebrate rather than condemn. But it remains to be seen if the coming national discussion will be based on facts like these or on something else altogether. And what of that debate, both overseas and at home? More to follow. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Michael Hayden.","Supporters of NSA metadata program only had 12-vote margin in favor .

"London (CNN) -- The Red Cross's declaration Sunday that Syria is engaged in a civil war -- or in the organization's legalistic phrasing, a ""non-international armed conflict"" -- may have struck some observers as a case of stating the obvious. But the assessment from the Geneva-based body is significant. It means the violence that has plagued the Middle Eastern nation since early 2011 has crossed a legal threshold whereby combatants throughout the country are subject to the Geneva Conventions -- and as such can be prosecuted for war crimes. Who are the Red Cross? The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) is the guardian of the Geneva Conventions, which set down the rules of war. The organization was formed after the Battle of Solferino in 1859 in Italy. A Swiss businessman, Henry Dunant, encountered nearly 40,000 wounded, dying and dead lying unattended on the battlefield. He subsequently lobbied for the establishment of a permanent humanitarian relief agency to act during times of war, protected by a government treaty recognizing the neutrality of the agency and safeguarding its operations. These goals were realized through the establishment of the Red Cross and the First Geneva Convention, ratified by 12 nations in 1864. Dunant was jointly awarded the first Nobel Peace Prize in 1901 for his efforts. Part of the Red Cross's legal mandate is to determine whether an armed conflict exists, and whether international humanitarian law applies. What is the ICRC's new assessment of the situation? The ICRC's classification of the violence as a ""non-international armed conflict"" means international humanitarian law will extend beyond the three regions in Syria where the organization had previously determined to be areas of armed conflict -- namely Homs, Hama and Idlib -- to apply wherever fighting occurs. ""These rules impose limits on all parties on how fighting can be conducted, with the aim of protecting the civilian population and persons not, or no longer, directly participating in the hostilities,"" said ICRC spokeswoman Carla Haddad Mardini told CNN. The ICRC will work to remind both the Syrian government and the armed opposition of their obligations to respect international humanitarian law, and share its analysis of what is occurring with both sides. It is hoped this will have an effect on the way the war is fought, by helping to regulate the conduct of fighters and safeguard the rights of innocents affected by the violence. How was the violence in Syria classified previously? For months, the Red Cross has classified the violence in Syria as internal armed conflicts between government forces and armed opposition groups localized to three flashpoints mentioned above. But the spread of hostilities to other areas has led the Swiss-based agency to conclude the fighting meets its threshold for an internal armed conflict. International humanitarian law now applies ""wherever hostilities take place,"" the organization said Monday. What are the Geneva Conventions? The Geneva Conventions and their Additional Protocols are international treaties that, in the words of the Red Cross, ""contain the most important rules limiting the barbarity of war."" Applicable during times of armed conflict, they form the cornerstone of international humanitarian law, setting rules for the treatment of people who are not participating in the fighting -- civilians, health workers and aid workers -- as well as for the wounded, sick or prisoners of war. Read the 1949 Geneva Conventions here . Common Article 3 of the conventions, which relates to ""non-international armed conflicts"" -- the most common form of conflict in the world today -- is applicable to the situation in Syria. ""The term ""civil war"", often used as a synonym for ""internal armed conflict"" (or) ""armed conflict not of an international character,"" has no legal status,"" said Mardini. Special rules apply to the most serious contraventions of the law, which are termed grave breaches and constitute war crimes. What counts as a ""grave breach?"" These crimes include willful killing, torture or inhumane treatment, including biological experiments; willfully causing great suffering or serious injury; and wanton, unlawful extensive destruction and appropriation of property not justified by military necessity. Read the definition of grave breaches here . Nations that are party to the conventions have an obligation to seek and put on trial or extradite those responsible for grave breaches, regardless of their nationality. What is the history of the Geneva Conventions? Efforts to moderate the behavior of soldiers are as old as recorded history itself. In the sixth century BC, the Chinese general and military strategist Sun Tzu suggested specific restrictions on military conduct, while in 1625, the Dutch theorist Hugo Grotius called for civilian protections in ""On the Law of War and Peace."" Throughout the history of warfare, agreements on the rules of war were defined by custom or negotiated between generals prior to battle, but did not extend widely beyond the conflict in question. The modern Geneva Conventions were adopted in 1949, in the aftermath of World War II, and expanded their focus to include civilians for the first time, in an attempt to prevent another outbreak of the ""total war"" which had wreaked havoc on civilian populations. Who recognizes the Geneva Conventions? The Geneva Conventions entered into force on 21 October 1950 and have gradually grown in recognition to become universally applicable. More than 70 countries ratified the conventions during the 1950s, and today 194 nations are party to the agreement. Do they have an impact on the battlefield? According to the ICRC, yes. While the nature of war has changed radically in the decades since the conventions were drafted, they continue to act as a powerful deterrent to the commission of atrocities in times of conflict. The ICRC's director of international law Philip Spoerri told CNN in 2009 that enforcing compliance with the conventions, rather than recodifying their core principles, should be a priority for international humanitarian law. Simon Hooper contributed to this report.","The Red Cross has determined that Syria is in a state of civil war .

"(CNN) -- A government advisory panel voted Tuesday to recommend eliminating prescription drugs that combine acetaminophen with narcotics -- such as Vicodin and Percocet -- because of their risk for overdose and for severe liver injury. Acetaminophen, found in drugs such as Tylenol, is one of the most commonly used drugs in the United States. The panel, assembled by the Food and Drug Administration, voted 20 to 17 to advise the FDA to remove such prescription combination drugs from the market. The group recommended that the FDA ""send a clear message that there's a high likelihood of overdose from prescription narcotics and acetaminophen products,"" Dr. Sandra L. Kweder of the FDA's Office of New Drugs said at a news conference after Tuesday's meeting. The panel was meeting for the second day to vote on recommendations to reduce the risk of serious liver injury associated with acetaminophen, which is found not only in prescription drugs, but also in over-the-counter medications such as Tylenol and NyQuil. It also advised the FDA to lower the maximum daily dose of acetaminophen in over-the-counter and prescription medications, and to address the formulations and dosing recommendations for children. Kweder said the FDA is already ""well on the road"" to addressing the pediatric concerns. The FDA is not required to follow the recommendations of its advisory committees, although the agency typically does. If the agency does not choose to eliminate prescription combination drugs, the panel said the FDA should lower the amount of acetaminophen in the drugs and also take some action to ensure that subscribers and patients are aware of potential liver damage posed by taking these products, Kweder said. In another vote, the panel had voted to advise the FDA to put a boxed warning on the prescription combination drugs. Although acetaminophen is one of the most commonly used drugs in the United States for treating pain and fever, overdoses of acetaminophen have been linked to 56,000 emergency room visits, 26,000 hospitalizations and 458 deaths during the 1990s, according to the FDA, citing one study. The agency cited another study, a 2007 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention population-based report, that estimated acetaminophen was the likely cause of most of the estimated 1,600 acute liver failures each year. The advisory panel could have voted to recommend pulling over-the-counter drugs that use acetaminophen in combination with other ingredients -- such as NyQuil, Pamprin and Allerest -- but it chose not to. Some panelists cited data that suggests that combination over-the-counter drugs account for less than 10 percent of acetaminophen overdoses. Kweder said families should carefully read medicine labels to know what is in the medicine and how much should be taken. Abbott Laboratories, which makes the brand-name Vicodin, which has also been available as a generic since the mid-1980s, said in a statement that ""today's discussion is an important continuation of the dialog around balancing patient safety with the need for treatment options for patients in pain."" It said, ""Pain affects 75 million Americans, more than diabetes, cancer and heart disease combined"" and added that it would follow the FDA's final determination. Endo Pharmaceuticals, which makes the brand-name Percocet, did not immediately return a phone call seeking comment. Percocet is also available as a generic. CNN's Saundra Young and Taylor Gandossy contributed to this report.","NEW: Panel votes to kill prescription drugs that combine acetaminophen, narcotics .

"(CNN) -- Onne van der Wal was born to be on the water -- and after witnessing decades of incredible sailing innovations, the renowned photographer now feels like he's an ""astronaut of the sea."" ""It's more like space travel and I love it,"" the Dutchman says of yachting's extraordinary technological progress over the past 30 years. While he hasn't quite had to reach for a helmet and suit, the boats which van der Wal now sails on are light years away from those which he used to frequent as a youngster. The America's Cup competition, in particular, has taken advantage of innovative materials such as carbon fiber and Kevlar, which were used on the International Space Station and the Space Shuttle orbiter, to create futuristic racing machines. ""When I started racing large sailboats offshore, the sails were made of Dacron, one click up from canvas,"" van der Wal told CNN. ""The masts were built of aluminum or wood, and the hulls were built of aluminum or fiberglass. ""Today it's all about carbon-fiber boats -- lighter, stiffer, faster -- and the spars (used in rigging) are taller, skinnier, stiffer and smaller sections. ""The sails are laminated, made of carbon or Kevlar, have perfect shape, keep their shape for longer periods of time, have a wider wind range and most importantly are much lighter and easier to handle."" Van der Wal made his first real foray into the world of sailing photography after taking part in the 1981 Round the World Race -- an event now known as the Volvo Ocean Race. A keen sailor as a child and teenager, the sea was a second home to the Dutchman, who was brought up in Hout Bay, South Africa. While working on commercial fishing vessels and maintaining race boats, van der Wal spent much of his spare time sailing -- crossing the Atlantic more than 10 times as well as racing in several other events. But it is that race some 33 years ago which is etched into his memory -- a relic from sailing's past which gave little clue as what was to follow. ""When I did the Round the World race it was an adventure; the same race is now a business run by professionals and sailed by well-paid professionals,"" he recalls. ""If you want to see a change in sailing, look at the America's Cup. The boats they now sail are so extreme, very cool, but talk about light years from just 10 years ago. ""Then the top speed of the boat was about 15 miles per hour and nowadays they're hitting 50 mph. ""Foiling 72-foot catamarans with wing masts, space-age stuff built of all carbon, now that's a change in what was yachting. It still is but it sure doesn't look and feel like it."" After being approached to take photographs by Sail Magazine during the 1981 race, van der Wal soon discovered he possessed a talent few others could equal. The thrill of combining his love of sailing with his penchant for photography has taken him as far north as Spitsbergen in the Norwegian Arctic and as far south as Antarctica. Now living in Newport, Rhode Island with his wife and three children, van der Wal has continued to produce some of the most beautiful images that the sailing world has seen. His new book ""Sailing,"" which includes nearly 200 color photographs and five gatefolds of panoramic images, showcases work from across the globe. ""I'm so lucky to do a job I love,"" he says. ""I've had some wonderful experiences. ""There are times where you are barely afloat and have the gales blowing. There have been some scary moments, but to get the pictures you have to go through all of that. ""If you stay at home you won't get those photos."" The advances in technology have not only helped the experienced professionals -- the amateur photographer is now better equipped than ever. Smartphone cameras and DSLRs make taking photos easier than ever, and van der Wal believes these developments can only be good for photography in the long run. ""We've come a hell of a long way since film,"" he adds. ""The change has been radical and has not only dramatically changed photography for the professionals but brought it to the masses as well. ""Everybody now shoots be it with smartphone or a DSLR. The pictures are better, sharper, better color, no grain, super sensitive in low light -- you can shoot by candle light if needed. ""You can blow up the images to the size of a billboard and to top it all off it's so much easier to do. ""The tools we have today make for much better photography for everyone, and I love it.""","Onne van der Wal is one of world's most famous sailing photographers .

"(CNN) -- Chicana author Sandra Cisneros is perhaps best-known for her 1984 coming of age novel, ""The House on Mango Street,"" a story about a young Latina who leaves behind her barrio for a chance at a better life. The novel, also released in Spanish, has sold more than 4 million copies and is a considered a classic of Chicano literature. But not everyone is a fan, specifically the Tucson Unified School District in Arizona, which banned Cisneros' book in its suspension of its Mexican-American studies program. It still bewilders Cisneros and her fans: How can a character who spends most of her time at the library and shares her experiences with her mother and blind aunt offend a school district? Cisneros is on a national book tour this month for ""Have You Seen Marie?"" a tale about a woman's search for a cat who goes missing in the wake of her mother's death. It's a fable for grieving grown-ups, and at less than 100 pages, she hopes the book will be medicine for hearts broken from loss. California-based artist Ester Hernandez, known for her depiction of Latina and Chicana women through prints and pastels, represented the unique and colorful characters, all based on Cisneros' neighbors. They make up the quirky King William district of San Antonio, Texas, where the story is based. Cisneros tell us what inspired the tale, why she is planning a move to Mexico and how she feels about her famous book being banned. CNN: What inspired you to write ""Have You Seen Marie?"" Cisneros: I was working on the 25th anniversary tour of ""The House on Mango Street."" I wanted to make a small book that people could have or give to someone in a place of grief. My mother had just passed, but I still felt the need to create something. My friend and artist of the book, Ester Hernandez, had just lost her mother too, and I proposed that she join me, and she very reluctantly joined the project. CNN: What do you want your readers to take away after reading this book? Cisneros: I hope that they understand that when they are in a time of grief, there is something to be gained during the time, even though we tend to focus on what we've lost. But when you have your heart broken wide, you are also open to things of beauty as well as things of sadness. Once people are not here physically, the spiritual remains, we still connect, we can communicate, we can give and receive love and forgiveness. There is love after someone dies. CNN: Were you surprised to hear that ""The House on Mango Street"" was the list of banned books in Arizona? Have you ever considered yourself a controversial writer? Cisneros: Gosh, no! I don't think they read the books. They just eliminated the entire whole Mexican-American studies without thinking. It should be called American studies, and all the books should be re-introduced. Then there would be less of an uproar. The fact that there is a hyphen there tells you a lot about our times. And our whole relationship with Mexico, which has always been very controversial, especially now. CNN: There has been talk about you wanting to improve your Spanish; is that true? And por qué? Cisneros: What's always a challenge for me is that my Spanish is not the level of my English. Nor do I read in Spanish the way I read in English. I want my Spanish to be like that of a newscaster. ... That's a different kind of Spanish. I feel comfortable in Spanish, I chat like a parrot, but I don't have the confidence in Spanish that I do in English. I'm perfectly fine in the mercado, and I can make people laugh and tell a story, but my vocabulary is limited. For example, I don't know the Spanish word for ""contractor."" But I'm going to Mexico to live for a year! This is the first time I'm going to live there. I just need to be in an environment where all I hear is Spanish.

"Boston (CNN) -- To see Mery Daniel today is to see how far she has come. Walking on her new prosthetic leg without crutches is a huge accomplishment, but to see Daniel ride 26 miles on a hand cycle underscores the tremendous progress she's made in the five months since the Boston Marathon bombings. ""This is the biggest challenge I've faced since the bombing,"" the 31-year-old Haitian immigrant said, referring to her participation in a recent ride from Waltham, Massachusetts, to Gillette Stadium in Foxboro. She beamed as her 5-year old daughter, Ciarra, and husband, Richardson, ran to offer hugs and congratulations. ""It's great,"" Richardson says proudly. ""It's very encouraging to see -- despite what she's been through."" April 15 was the day that profoundly changed Mery's life and that of so many others. Three people were killed and more than 250 were injured when a pair of bombs exploded just seconds apart near the finish line of the Boston Marathon. Suspect Tamerlan Tsarnaev was killed four days later in a standoff with police. His younger brother, Dzhokhar, faces charges that could bring a life sentence or the death penalty if he is convicted. He has pleaded not guilty. More than 14 people lost limbs in the bombing. Mery lost her left leg; amputated above the knee. Her right leg was spared, but it was severely mangled and she lost a significant portion of her calf. The team at Boston's Spaulding Rehabilitation Hospital oversees the therapy for many of the new amputees. Mery's Journey part one: Woman gets new leg -- and a new life . Tim Sullivan, director of communications, remembers when Mery first arrived. ""It's amazing to see her first in the hospital bed only a few days after the marathon to now seeing her and others do this [ride]. It's incredible."" Sullivan arranged for Mery and two other bombing victims to participate in a recent challenge for Ride 2 Recovery, a non-profit organization that provides physical and mental rehabilitation to injured veterans through the sport of cycling. For Mery, the ride was a way to show solidarity. ""I think we share a common link in life right now because a lot of them [veterans] have injuries that are similar to mine."" Sullivan, who rode to the 26-mile mark with Mery, says it was a testament ""to the caregivers who helped save their lives and the therapists who brought them along and to most of all them to have the strength to do this."" Learning to walk ... again . Mery laughs when you try to call her strong. ""If it comes out as being strong then that's what it is but I don't plan to be strong."" At her apartment in Boston, she talks about relearning to walk and admits it was a daunting challenge and a lot of hard work. Mery spent an intensive week of therapy at Spaulding and says there were mornings she didn't even want to get out of bed. ""It was extremely difficult. The whole putting the leg on, I didn't feel like I could do it and you have to wait close to 15 minutes before it adjusts properly. It can be painful,"" she says, as the lower limb sinks into the prosthesis. ""You have to overcome the pressure barrier,""but she quickly adds, ""I'm alive and that's the important thing."" Mery worked hard; strengthening her core muscles and weaning herself off crutches. Her gait is slow and deliberate, but she is walking on her own now and getting stronger every day. The difficult, but rewarding, work has inspired Mery and she says, ""I'm even thinking about rehabilitation medicine. I'm a patient, too, and I think I can share a lot with patients. We have that in common."" Mery came to the United States with the dream of being a doctor; she attended medical school abroad and had returned to Boston not long before the bombings. Boston bombing survivor meets woman she says saved her life . Her plans were interrupted, but Mery says she's still determined to study and pass the exams so she can practice medicine here. A proud Richardson says he is very optimistic about her future. ""I have no doubt she will be great and reach her goals, it will take time, but I know she will do it."" For now, Mery continues her therapy twice a week and has even renewed an old goal -- to run a marathon. But not just any. Mery wants to run the Boston Marathon. She says it's all about showing her daughter that you can overcome even the biggest obstacles. ""I want to teach Ciarra that, no matter what happens, not to lose enthusiasm and, no matter what happens, to keep going strong."" Help in recovery . Mery is finding her way past the horror and tragedy. She says her family keeps her looking forward. This month, the family got bigger when her two brothers and sister, ages 20, 18 and 14 arrived in Boston from Haiti to live with her. ""I was so excited to see them,"" she exclaimed. ""It's really good to have family around; especially now. It's a form of support."" The Boston apartment now teeming, Mery spends much of her time hunting for a home that is big enough for everyone. She's also looking into schools for her siblings, making sure they have their vaccinations. ""They're here and I'm responsible for them and they look to me. So that pushes me to do what needs to be done and that is helping me, too, in a way."" Don't call her a victim . Since the bombings, Mery says her insurance hasn't put up a fight about paying her medical bills. Her new leg alone costs $50,000. But there is worry down the road when adjustments and a new prosthetic become necessary. Dr. David Crandell, director of Spaulding's amputee program, says, ""they [insurance companies] will cover a basic cost but they may not cover the full or higher end prosthesis so the patient has to be a good advocate."" One Fund Boston has distributed more than $60 million to some 237 victims even as donations continue to come in. Merydaniel.com, a website Mery's friend set up, has raised some $46,200 -- but has hit a plateau, she says. The monies are set aside in a trust for Mery that will be used for future medical expenses and her overall well-being. ""I'm thankful for those who have donated but people move on. Even us survivors, we don't stay in the moment, either. We move on,"" she says. ""But I do think it's important for people to be reminded of what happened that day."" Asked about her reflections on the last five months, Mery will tell you she is stronger and that she is no victim. She is a survivor. ""You have to go through certain things in life, certain hurdles to really get to your element -- to find out who you are ... I don't want to say I'm glad it happened, but if I could use that to better myself then that's a good thing. Now it's part of me, and so I move on and I'm learning how to live my life. And that to me is -- it's like I'm winning."" Jeff Bauman, Boston Marathon bombing survivor, gets book deal .

"London (CNN) -- Journalists hacked into the phone messages of a missing girl, deleting some to make space for more and thus giving her parents hope she was still alive when she was dead, the parents' lawyer told CNN on Tuesday. ""The family are completely horrified. They thought this was all over"" after the disappearance of Milly Dowler in 2002 and the conviction of a man for her murder this year, lawyer Mark Lewis said. But in April, police told the Dowlers that journalists had hacked into their phones and those of their daughter, he said. The accusation is the latest twist in a long-running scandal involving media baron Rupert Murdoch's flagship Sunday British tabloid newspaper, the News of the World. The paper has apologized for hacking into the voicemails of celebrities and politicians, paying compensation to actress Sienna Miller and offering money to others. But the Dowler case is the first time the newspaper is accused of interfering with a police investigation. British Prime Minister David Cameron on Tuesday called the allegations ""quite shocking"" and urged the police to investigate thoroughly. A former top tabloid journalist Tuesday called the allegations a significant change in the course of the scandal. ""Before we had hacking of celebrities and politicians, but here we have the interference of a murder inquiry involving a 13-year-old girl,"" said Roy Greenslade, a former editor of the Daily Mirror and an assistant editor of the Sun, a sister paper of News of The World. ""Outside of the political elite in Britain, this story has had little traction until now. The allegations about the hacking of Milly Dowler's phone has the potential to change that,"" Greenslade said. Police Monday declined to say whether Milly Dowler was among the victims of phone hacking. Meanwhile a private investigator working for News of the World who was jailed over another phone hacking case, in 2007, issued a statement to the UK's Guardian newspaper apologizing for the ""hurt"" caused by his actions. Glenn Mulcaire did not mention hacking Milly Dowler's phone but said he had never intended to interfere in any police inquiry. He said he had faced ""relentless pressure"" for results at the paper, and that while he knew they were pushing ethical boundaries, he had not understood they were breaking the law. Executives from Murdoch's News International met with British police Tuesday over the claims, the company told CNN. One of the top company officials told staff later that it was ""almost too horrific to believe that a professional journalist or even a freelance inquiry agent working on behalf of a member of the News of the World staff could behave in this way."" Rebekah Brooks, who was editor of the paper at the time of the alleged hacking and is now chief executive of News International, told staff she was ""sickened that these events are alleged to have happened."" She said she had contacted the Dowlers on Tuesday ""to assure them News International will vigorously pursue the truth and that they will be the first to be informed of the outcome of our investigation."" Brooks asked Lewis, the Dowler lawyer, to show the company any evidence it had ""so we can swiftly take the appropriate action."" She said News International was cooperating with police investigations. CNN obtained a copy of the e-mail Brooks sent to staff on Tuesday. News International confirmed it was genuine. Brooks acknowledges in the message that there is speculation she might resign, but said she was ""determined to lead the company to ensure we do the right thing and resolve these serious issues."" The tumult may have an impact on the newspaper's advertising revenues. Ford Britain said it was withdrawing its advertising from News of the World until there was an outcome from its investigation. ""Ford is a company which cares about standards of behaviour of its own people and those it deals with externally,"" the carmaker said in a statement. A spokesman for T-Mobile said the firm was reviewing its advertising position with the News of the World, while supermarket chain Tesco said the latest allegations would ""cause huge distress to a family which has suffered enough"" and said it was awaiting the result of the police inquiry. At least five people have been arrested in connection with phone hacking investigations this year since a new investigation, Operation Weeting, was launched in January. Mulcaire and a journalist working for the News of the World were sent to prison in 2007 for hacking into the voicemails of royal staff in an earlier investigation. Police launched the new investigation this year in response to widespread complaints from politicians, celebrities and other high-profile figures who fear they have been targets. News International has apologized for unspecified cases of phone hacking. They say they have been cooperating with police since the new investigation was launched in January. The Sunday tabloid newspaper in April offered compensation and ""apologized unreservedly"" for the ""unacceptable"" hacking. It did not name the victims. News International owns the News of the World, plus the Sun, the Times and the Sunday Times in Britain. Murdoch's media empire also encompasses Fox News, the Wall Street Journal, the New York Post and Harper Collins publishers. CNN's Jonathan Wald, Dan Rivers, J.P. Landry, Peter Wilkinson and Antonia Mortensen contributed to this report.","NEW: Private investigator jailed over phone hacking apologizes to anyone hurt by his acts .

"(CNN) -- After days of pleading with drug company executives, Josh Hardy's parents got what they'd been praying for: a chance to get medicine that could help their son survive. The Chimerix pharmaceutical company said Tuesday that the ailing 7-year-old will receive medicine that doctors hope will help him when he becomes the first patient in a new trial set to start Wednesday. Todd Hardy, Josh's father, said he got the call from Chimerix president Kenneth Moch about a half hour before the public announcement was made. ""It was wonderful,"" Hardy said. ""Truly wonderful. It was overwhelming."" In an emotional Facebook post, mother Aimee Hardy praised the company's decision. ""Glory to GOD!"" she wrote. ""They are releasing the drug for Josh!!!!!!!!!"" The company had previously denied calls from the 7-year-old's family to give him the drug, brincidofovir, arguing that spending the time to help Josh and others like him would slow down efforts to get the drug on the market. Josh's story drew national attention as his parents and supporters pushed the company to change its mind in online and media campaigns. CNN told Josh's story Sunday night, describing his parents' desperate pleas for help from Chimerix. Josh's journey began when he was diagnosed with a rare form of kidney cancer at 9 months old. Over the years, cancer turned up in his thymus, lung, and bone marrow, and each time Josh beat it. But a bone marrow transplant left Josh without much of an immune system, and in February doctors diagnosed him with an adenovirus that spread through his body. Now he's in critical condition in an intensive care unit as the virus ravages his body. Josh is in heart and kidney failure. He vomits blood several times an hour as his family gathers in vigil. His doctors at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital in Memphis had also been pushing for the company to provide the drug. In a statement Tuesday, the hospital said it expected to receive the medication within 48 hours, but noted that its safety and effectiveness has not yet been established for use in children. ""It is also important to understand that this remains a critical and complex medical situation,"" the hospital said. ""St. Jude will continue to pursue state-of-the-art treatment for Josh and all of our patients. We are grateful for the efforts of Chimerix, the FDA and many others who worked to achieve this outcome. We ask that you continue to keep Josh and his family in your thoughts."" An FDA policy known as ""compassionate use"" allows someone with a serious or life-threatening disease to ask a drug company for an experimental drug. Though it's called compassionate use, sometimes it feels anything but compassionate. Companies often say yes: The FDA approved 974 compassionate use arrangements in fiscal year 2013. But pharmaceutical companies often say no, as Chimerix did at first to Josh Hardy. Moch previously told CNN he wouldn't back down from his decision not to give Josh the drug. He said Tuesday that he hopes the new FDA-approved study will help other patients as well. ""I'm happy for Josh and I'm happy for many patients,"" Moch said. ""We've come up with a way of helping not just Josh, but helping other patients in need, and there are many."" Over the past two years, the company has received more than 80 requests for compassionate use of brincidofovir from patients like Hardy, according to Moch. Todd Hardy hailed Moch as a hero. ""He's a super man. He worked diligently on behalf of everybody,"" Hardy said. ""His integrity was unquestioned. He was utterly professional."" A Facebook page dedicated to the online campaign to help Josh get the medicine posted a thank-you message to supporters Tuesday night. ""Thank you to every member of Josh's Army. The world has heard you and because of you Josh and many others will have the opportunity to receive CMX001 (Brincidofovir) the life saving antiviral drug made by Chimerix."" In cancer drug battle, both sides appeal to ethics . CNN's Ed Payne, Jennifer Moore and Jennifer Bixler contributed to this report.","7-year-old Josh Hardy will receive a drug his family hopes will save his life .

"(CNN) -- What if you found yourself stuck alone at a faraway airport -- with no money, credit cards or ID? How easily could you fly back home again? You might survive if you had a smartphone. Emerging ""empty pockets"" technology is increasingly allowing travelers to use their phones to make purchases, book flights, check in and board planes. Wallets? They're so 2008. Delta, American and United are already big into electronic boarding passes on smartphones, and stragglers like JetBlue are planning e-boarding programs in the near future. What's next? If some visionaries have their way, the future of mobile travel will touch virtually every key activity at the airport -- including security and U.S. passports. Smartphone technology might improve airport efficiency and help ease the pain from skyrocketing traffic predicted in the next 20 years. But is a post-9/11 world comfortable with the idea of merging personal cell phones into the airport security network? Apple -- still basking in the afterglow of last week's iPhone 5 curtain raiser -- is also unveiling Passbook, an app which organizes e-boarding passes, flight reservations, coupons and other documents. But Apple has a much more grandiose plan for its empty pocket dreams, according to public U.S. Patent and Trademark Office documents. Read the patent document (PDF). For example, imagine checking bags with your cell phone -- or passing through security by flashing an official driver's license or U.S. passport displayed on your phone. Outside the airport, envision using just your phone to rent a car or to check into a hotel. How about using your phone as an electronic hotel room key? But let's get real, say industry experts and government officials. As cool as all these ideas sound, extending Apple's technology and influence to airport baggage tracking and TSA security would be unprecedented. ""I'm always kind of staggered by the scale and complexity and the ambition that they have,"" says mobile phone industry analyst Nick Holland of Yankee Group. As you might expect from the secretive folks at Apple, they wouldn't talk to CNN about the patent documents. But we did grab some time with ""Apple Insider"" reporter Neil Hughes, who covers nothing but Apple, including its patents for future products. ""Security may be the biggest issue,"" says Hughes. Carrying all your personal ID and travel documents on a single device would be very tempting for skilled password hacks, says Hughes. Related story: Your smartphone will eventually be hacked . The concept . The 2008 patent application was approved in July and filed under the working title ""iTravel."" Hughes suspects the iTravel concept will be folded into Apple's Passbook app, which will be available for download on Wednesday. Right now, Passbook will store electronic versions of airline boarding passes which will automatically pop up on iPhone screens when you arrive at the airport. The phone knows where you are, thanks to geo-locator technology. That aspect alone will make a lot of gadget-geeky travelers feel all gee-whizzy inside. Even more gee-whizzy: The patent calls for iPhones to automatically check in luggage when passengers approach an airport baggage check-in kiosk. (See details in the photo gallery above.) Would security benefit from smart-phone based e-passports and e-drivers licenses? Would they increase speed, efficiency or security at TSA check points? Currently -- as most of us know -- TSA agents briefly examine government ID and boarding passes as each passenger presents their documents at a checkpoint at the end of a security line. Related story: Apple's secrets aren't so secret anymore . Under Apple's patent, a traveler's phone would automatically send electronic identification to a TSA agent as soon as the traveler gets in line. While each traveler waits in line, TSA agents would examine the electronic ID at an electronic viewing station. Next, at the X-ray stations, a traveler's phone would confirm to security agents that the traveler's ID had already been checked. Throughout the process, the phone photo could be displayed on a screen for comparison with the traveler. Facial recognition software could be included in the process. (See details on Apple's proposal in the photo gallery above.) The patent documents offer a surprising number of details which open doors to key questions about the system, but Apple declined to discuss the patent. The TSA wouldn't comment either on the viability of Apple's plan. But other government officials, aviation authorities and longtime industry experts say Apple faces at least three high hurdles if they want to see this idea to fruition. Verification . Several experts say a key question that must be answered is: How would you prove that the phone is yours? In other words, how would you prove that the e-passport is actually you? To get around this problem, future phones or electronic ID may require some form of biometric security function -- like fingerprint matching. In general, passports must be designed to be difficult to copy. Recent security changes to U.S. passports have included a hidden radio frequency identification chip to hinder counterfeiters. The chip includes the same data as the paper passport, a unique chip ID number, a digital version of the passport holder's photo ""which will facilitate the use of face recognition technology at ports-of-entry,"" according to the State Department website. Universality . Any company that intends to create an official electronic ID will have to work closely with countless government authorities to come up with secure, verifiable standards. Think about the complexity of that idea across 50 U.S. states and all the nations that travelers visit each year. An electronic passport would have to be approved by an international standards organization, and it would have to be usable from country to country, according to the U.S. State Department, which oversees U.S. passports. There are ongoing government efforts aimed at using technology to enhance passport security and convenience, according to a State Department official. But the State Department says a smartphone portable e-passport is unlikely to become a reality anytime soon. ""We're not at a point where the government is going to go digital for any of that stuff,"" says Hughes, of ""Apple Insider."" Then he laughs and says, ""I mean, I'm not even allowed to laminate my Social Security card."" Related story: Opinion: Airport Wi-Fi and mobile services are lacking . Infrastructure . Apple's patent calls for the placement of special kiosks around the airport which will automatically exchange data with your phone via a close range wireless technology called near field communication (NFC). Apple phones -- including the new iPhone 5 -- don't include NFC, but they eventually would, according to the iTravel patent. Related story: NFC isn't ready for prime time . If consumers, airlines, airports and the TSA don't embrace the NFC kiosks, experts say it's unlikely Apple's vision would become reality. ""First you would have to sell industry on Apple's idea, says Hughes. ""Then you'd have to sell it to travel consumers."" Case in point: Google Wallet, a mobile phone app which allows people to make purchases with their NFC-enabled android phones. You set it up by attaching your Wallet account to your credit card. Then, you wave your phone near a special NFC-enabled point-of-purchase terminal, and voila! It's paid for. Most NewYork City taxis take Google Wallet. Travelers using Newark Liberty Airport can tap their Wallet-enabled phones at the New Jersey Transit rail station and at New York's Penn Station. Many cabs in San Francisco also are Wallet-friendly. Also, using Google Wallet will get you access to special discount offers. Google isn't ruling out adding more travel features to Wallet -- like e-boarding passes. ""A wallet can hold all kinds of things,"" hints Google's Nate Tyler. ""Things are absolutely in development."" A little more than a year after launching, Google Wallet has about 200,000 NFC point of purchase terminals nationwide, according to Google. Although the concept may be ahead of its time, analyst Holland says Google Wallet remains less than successful because there simply aren't enough terminals. ""They're probably about three years premature,"" Holland says. ""It's a chicken-and-egg problem,"" says Hughes. ""You need to have the NFC kiosks there and you need to be aware of it and the stores have to invest in it, so sometimes it just doesn't catch on."" Along with making a buck, Silicon Valley appears to be trying to make travel more convenient through smartphone technology. That makes sense, because travelers will need all the help they can get to plot a course through increasingly crowded airports. The number of yearly U.S. commercial airline passengers is expected to nearly double to 1.2 billion by 2032, according to the FAA. As increasingly complicated smart-phone partnerships evolve between the tech world and the sprawling travel industry bureaucracy, it looks like growing pains will be unavoidable.","Apple releases Passbook travel/coupon app Wednesday .

"Washington (CNN) -- House Budget Chairman Paul Ryan, R-Wisconsin, will unveil a highly anticipated 2012 Republican budget next week that proposes dramatic changes to political lightning rods: entitlements. The plan, to be released Tuesday, calls for a controversial overhaul of Medicare, the health care program for seniors, and imposes deep cuts in Medicaid, which provides health benefits to low-income Americans, according to House Republican sources with knowledge of the proposal. Starting 10 years from now, in 2021, Americans would no longer enroll in the Medicare program, but instead receive vouchers for private insurance, according to the GOP sources, who stressed anyone 55 or older now would not be affected by the change. The plan is modeled after one Ryan proposed last year with Alice Rivlin, budget director under President Bill Clinton. Details of how Ryan's Medicare voucher program would work are still unclear, but the Ryan-Rivlin plan said the amount of the voucher -- a lump sum payment from the government -- would be calculated in part by taking the average federal cost per Medicare enrollee. The GOP aims  to save billions of dollars in revamping Medicare, a large contributor to the massive federal deficit and debt. Sources said they did not yet know how much savings Ryan would project by drastically changing the Medicare program. On Medicaid, Ryan's plan calls for deep cuts, as much as $1 trillion. The program would also fundamentally change -- the federal share of the Medicaid system would become block grants to the states. CNN has been told that the House GOP budget plan does not call for significant change to the Social Security program. Republicans argue that while Social Security is a factor in the nation's fiscal crisis, it doesn't contribute as much to the soaring debt as Medicare. Two House GOP lawmakers briefed on the proposal told CNN they and others on the House Budget Committee believe it's a mistake not to tackle Social Security. As for so-called discretionary spending, one of the sources -- who would not speak on the record before the plan is publicly announced -- said Ryan's proposal promises to roll back spending to 2006 levels. It's unclear how much that would slash, but it is expected to be far more than the roughly $61 billion in spending cuts House Republicans passed in February. Ryan is expected to give specifics on how much savings the plan would create when it is unveiled Tuesday. A GOP source said even with the major cuts and changes in Ryan's proposal -- essentially a blueprint that guides spending decisions and does not go to the president for his signature -- it would not bring the budget into balance for many years. Still, GOP sources briefed on the plan said it would save hundreds of billions of dollars more than the president's proposed 2012 budget, and trillions over the next 10 years. The budget would also cut the corporate tax rate, but at the same time do away with tax loopholes for corporations. Ryan's plan also provides for a permanent extension of all the Bush-era tax cuts, which under a compromise with President Barack Obama were extended last year through 2012. House Republican leaders have been signaling for some time that they plan dramatic and controversial changes to entitlement programs in order to rein in the budget deficit and debt. Knowing that the proposed changes will be politically risky and elicit an onslaught of criticism, Ryan and Republican Whip Kevin McCarthy have been holding sessions two or three times a week with House Republicans to try to arm them with information about the gravity of the debt problem and why it needs to be fixed. CNN was allowed into one of these meetings last month, and heard Ryan lay out for his GOP colleagues in stark terms what he calls the ""tidal wave"" of debt the country is facing. ""The Congressional Budget Office has this economic model where they measure the economy going forward, and they are telling us that the entire economy crashes in the year 2037 because their computer simulation can't conceive of any way in which the U.S. economy can continue,"" Ryan told the GOP group. ""By the time my kids are my age, just those three programs -- Social Security, Medicaid and Medicare --will consume all federal revenues. There will be no room for anything else in the federal budget,"" Ryan said. When Ryan proposed a version of his Medicare overhaul idea last year, known as his ""road map,"" Democrats skewered it and tried to use it as a campaign weapon against Republicans across the country. Obama has often said it is important for Washington to address entitlement spending. But the president has not offered any specific proposals, and Republicans suggest he wants them to take the first risky steps. Multiple GOP sources admit the timing of Ryan's 2012 budget proposal is tricky. It will be released in the middle of down-to-the-wire, contentious negotiations with Democrats about a spending measure to keep the government running for the rest of this 2011 fiscal year. CNN has been told that GOP leaders considered delaying the release of Ryan's budget until this year's spending differences are resolved. However, they decided to go ahead with it in hopes showing major cuts and reforms planned for next year will calm rank-and-file conservatives who feel the leadership is too compromising on spending cuts.","Seniors would get vouchers for private insurance .

"(CNN) -- The new president of the American Medical Association, which represents the interests of the nation's doctors, said Wednesday the group is open to a government-funded health insurance option for people without coverage. Dr. Rohack called 2009 ""the year we need to have affordable health insurance coverage for all Americans."" Dr. J. James Rohack told CNN the AMA supports an ""American model"" that includes both ""a private system and a public system, working together."" In May, the AMA told a Senate committee it did not support a government-sponsored public health insurance option. ""The AMA does not believe that creating a public health insurance option ... is the best way to expand health insurance coverage and lower costs across the health care system,"" the organization wrote, explaining that a public insurance plan could lead to ""an explosion of costs that would need to be absorbed by taxpayers."" Rohack, who recently became AMA president, suggested Wednesday that the Federal Employee Health Benefit Program available to Congress members and other federal employees could be expanded as a public option. That would avoid having to create a new program from scratch, he said. ""If it's good enough for Congress, why shouldn't it be good enough for individuals who don't have health insurance provided by their employers?"" Rohack said. He said AMA opposed expanding Medicare coverage for senior citizens into a broader general public plan, noting the plan is ""going broke"" and fails to cover the costs of participating doctors. His comments come as President Obama is pressing Congress to push through a comprehensive bill to reform the nation's ailing health care system this year. Obama told a town hall meeting Wednesday the rising costs of health care threaten the economy and are unsustainable. Even health-related industries including drug companies were now acknowledging the need for reform, he said. Watch Dr. Rohack discuss health care reform » . Rohack said 2009 is ""the year we need to have affordable health insurance coverage for all Americans.""

"(CNN) -- Uganda's President has said he's seeking advice from American scientists before he decides whether to sign a bill that criminalizes homosexuality. Homosexual acts are illegal in Uganda. The proposed legislation passed by parliament toughens the penalties, including life imprisonment for certain acts. President Yoweri Museveni 's decision backtracks from his announcement last week, when he said he'd sign the bill for ""scientific"" reasons. At the time, he said that Ugandan scientists had determined there was no gene for homosexuality. ""It was learned and could be unlearned,"" he said. Shortly after his announcement, U.S. President Barack Obama warned that enacting the bill would affect relations between the two nations. He described the proposal as an ""affront and a danger to the gay community"" in Uganda. The United States and Britain are among the nation's largest donors. Placating Western donors . In what appears to be a move to placate Western donors, Museveni now says he is seeking extended guidance. In a statement this week, he said U.S. scientists sent him opinions indicating ""homosexuality could be congenital."" ""I therefore encourage the U.S. government to help us by working with our scientists to study whether, indeed, there are people who are born homosexual,"" Museveni said. ""When that is proved, we can review this legislation."" Years of debates . A Ugandan lawmaker first introduced the bill in 2009 with a death penalty clause for some homosexual acts. It was briefly shelved when Britain and other European nations threatened to withdraw aid to Uganda, which relies on millions of dollars from the international community. The nation's parliament passed the bill in December, replacing the death penalty provision with a proposal of life in prison for ""aggravated homosexuality."" This includes acts where one person is infected with HIV, ""serial offenders"" and sex with minors, Amnesty International said. The bill also proposed years in prison for anyone who counsels or reaches out to gays and lesbians, a provision that would ensnare rights groups and others providing services to lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people. Decisions, backtracking . This is the latest in a series of back-and-forth actions on the bill. Last month, Museveni said he wouldn't sign the bill, describing homosexuals as ""sick"" people who needed help, not imprisonment. Then he backtracked last week and said he'd sign it because scientists had determined that there's no gene for homosexuality and it was merely abnormal behavior. ""We shall have a war with the homosexual lobby in the world, but backed by these people (scientists) and you,"" he said at the time. Homosexuality is illegal in 38 African countries, where most sodomy laws were introduced during colonialism. In Uganda, homosexual acts are punishable by 14 years to life in prison. But lawmakers in the conservative nation have sought tougher legislation, saying the influence of Western lifestyles risks destroying family units. Rights groups worldwide have condemned the bill as draconian.","Last week, President Yoweri Museveni said he would sign a bill that criminalizes homosexuality .

"(CNN) -- The systematic use of performance enhancing substances within Lance Armstrong's former U.S. Postal Service team has been detailed by one cyclist who resisted the temptation to dope. A U.S. Anti-Doping Agency (USADA) report accused seven-time Tour de France winner Armstrong of being involved in ""the most sophisticated, professionalized and successful doping program that sport has ever seen."" Armstrong's representatives dismissed the 1,000-page report as ""a hatchet job"", but the experiences of former U.S. Postal Service cyclist Scott Mercier suggest a culture of doping existed within the team before Armstrong joined 14 years ago. Mercier claims he was given steroids by team doctor Pedro Celaya as part of a grueling training program in 1997, a year before Armstrong joined the team. Celaya did not reply when asked for a response by CNN, but he has denied the accusations to other media outlets. ""The only race I did that spring was in Switzerland, called the Tour of Romandie,"" Mercier explained to CNN, referring to the 1997 season. ""Pedro called the riders into his room one by one, and when I got there he gave me a training program. ""This program was on a calendar. We were supposed to recover because it had been a hard season, but there was a two-week block, about 16 days, where on each day he had dots or stars. ""We were supposed to do 200 to 250 kilometers per day. I asked him, 'what are these stars and dots for?' He handed me a zip lock bag full of pills and vials. I asked him, 'what do I have here?' and he said, 'these are steroids.' He said, 'you will go strong like bull.'"" Steroids increase the speed at which muscles can be built, although they can enhance masculine characteristics. Mercier was warned to not take any of the pills or liquids while he was racing, but he made the decision to avoid taking any of the substances. He persevered with his own training regime, but simply could not keep up with his teammates. ""I was living in South Africa at that time,"" continued Mercier. ""I decided to talk to my wife and that is when I decided I didn't want to be a professional anymore. ""I attempted to do the training program anyway and still got pretty fit, but you couldn't go everyday. ""Most people think you bulk up on steroids, but all it really does is allow you to recover so you can do the same effort. If you're doing endurance, you will stay light and get fast."" Statistics back up what Mercier suggests. The Tour de France's L'Alpe d'Huez is one of the most storied ascents in cycling and in 1986, five-time general classification winner Bernard Hinault completed the climb in 48 minutes. Marco Pantani now holds the record for the climb. His time, set in 1997, is 10 minutes and 25 seconds faster than that of Hinault. Armstrong clocked a time of 37 minutes and 36 seconds, just one second slower than Pantani, in 2004. Pantani, who was ejected from the 1999 Giro d'Italia following an abnormal blood reading, died of a cocaine overdose in 2004. Mercier feels that Celaya thought he was acting in the best interests of the riders, helping them to compete while also preventing them seeking drugs via riskier avenues. Dr Luis Garcia Del Moral replaced Celaya at the U.S. Postal team in 1999. Celaya was sacked as Armstrong ""did not feel that Celaya was aggressive enough in running the 'program,'"" according to the evidence given to USADA by U.S. Postal rider Jonathan Vaughters. ""Pedro was looking out for our interests,"" said Mercier. ""He wasn't doing anything that anyone else wasn't doing. He was trying to make sure the team would be competitive in a safe way. ""I really think he was trying to help us with our health so we weren't doing it in some back alley."" While Mercier admits to occasionally wondering what might have been had he decided to dope, he has no regrets over his decision to turn his back on professional cycling. ""People have said, 'geez, it was such a brave thing you did.' I did have a contract with Postal to go on for '98, I'm not sure I look at it the same way. ""It was heartbreaking but I knew that if I went and continued racing in '98, I wasn't going to be strong enough to continue to race with my peers putting me in the gutter and me not being competitive. I knew I would do what I had to do to be competitive. ""I guess to avoid that situation I think is cowardly. But I decided I'm not strong enough, I need to move out of my profession."" Now team doctor with Radioshack, the last team Armstrong raced for, Celaya will go before the Court of Arbitration for Sport later this year as he contests the charges brought against him by USADA. Despite the success enjoyed by other members of the Postal Service team such as Olympic gold medalist Tyler Hamilton and George Hincapie, who rode alongside Armstrong in each of his seven Tour de France wins, Mercier is happy with the decision he made to preserve his integrity rather than chase fame and fortune. Both Hamilton and Hincapie testified against Armstrong in USADA's report, while admitting to using performance enhancing substances. ""I wouldn't trade places with George Hincapie and his millions, or Tyler Hamilton and his Olympic medal. ""My wife said to me, 'Imagine you're coming home and telling your son and daughter daddy is a liar, a cheat and a fraud. You don't have to do that.' ""So I feel good about the decision I've made, I wouldn't change anything."" Both Hamilton and Hincapie testified against Armstrong in USADA's report, while admitting to using performance enhancing substances.","Former U.S. Postal Service rider Scott Mercier claims there was a culture of doping .

"(CNN) -- On the cover of their new book, ""You Have No Idea: A Famous Daughter, Her No-Nonsense Mother, and How They Survived Pageants, Hollywood, Love, Loss (And Each Other),"" singer/actress Vanessa Williams and her mother, Helen, radiate an empowered sophistication. Their pose eschews the clichÃ© embrace. Instead they strike a stance of support -- mother and daughter side by side, arms hooked. The book intertwines their two stories, how each has struggled on her own and how the complicated relationship that binds them still supplies a safety net. From public scandal -- she stepped down as the first black Miss America after nude photos of her appeared in Penthouse magazine -- to Broadway triumph, Williams has been on the celebrity radar for decades. Through it all, her mother has been a touchstone of humor and support in good times and bad. CNN sat down with both women to discuss their book, their parenting revelations and their memories from a lifetime in the spotlight. The following is an edited transcript of the conversation. CNN: How has your relationship evolved over time? Helen: Well, as Vanessa has grown into womanhood and become a mother, it's a more adult-to-adult relationship now, rather than the domineering mom, as they tend to think I was, to a more relaxed relationship but understanding that I'm still a mother in the relationship. Vanessa: As a mother now of four children, I can see her much more wholly as a woman, a mother, someone who has had a past and someone whose past has influenced her choices as well as mine. The wiser you get, the more experience you have, and the more you see people for who they are as human beings, as opposed to figures you have to fight against. I think I am much more conscious of back story, temperament and even going through perimenopause and how it can affect your mood, attitude and relations and how you deal with people. There are a lot of things that you don't realize that your parents are going through when you're a kid. CNN: How did you 'survive' all of that together? Helen: (Her father and I) were the support that we felt she needed to survive some of the things that she had to deal with that were not always the positive things. And we were also the supporters when something really exciting happened, like when she had her first Broadway show. Vanessa: And it's never-ending, especially in this business. You're always going to have people that are naysayers, that don't believe in your talent, that don't believe that you have any kind of longevity. I am happy to be able to look back -- because the book is called ""You Have No Idea,"" and every time there has been a major triumph in my career, nobody ever expected it. On Broadway: ""I didn't know she could sing and dance."" A No. 1 hit on the radio: ""I had no idea that she could be a recording artist."" With ""Ugly Betty"" and three Emmy nominations: ""I had no idea she was funny."" It is always redefining who you are and raging against the machine. CNN: What do you think mothers and daughters will take away from this book? Vanessa: I hope that they see that it's not all peaches and cream. Even when we shot the cover -- they had shown me the cover of Ellen Degeneres' book with her mom, and it was warm, loving and toasty, and they are embracing each other. And I said, ""That's not us!"" In the back of the book, you see me crowning her, because she is the real queen in our family. And so there is a sense of humor, which is part of our dynamic, and that's how we get through lots of things in our life. Helen: What I hope they take away is it's an honest story of two experiences, two different people with two different personalities, and how we were able to respect our roles as a mother and daughter and tell the story that worked for us with support, love, caring and being there for your child. CNN: What did you want for Vanessa? Helen: We wanted her to be whatever she chose to be as her life goal. To support her, doing whatever we could to make it happen. To be a happy, successful person. Vanessa: I also think, had I not been talented in the arts and I still wanted to be in it, they would have said ""Why don't you do something else?"" Luckily they saw my talent and my interest in it and they gave me all the gifts to allow me to take dance class, piano and French horn and be in theater and major in musical theater in college, rather than saying, ""Why don't you do something normal?"" or ""Get a real job."" I never heard that. CNN: As a mother now, do you hear yourself saying things that sound like your mother? Vanessa: When I heard it loud and clear was when I was on location shooting a show called ""Who Do You Think You Are."" I was on the phone with my 11-year-old daughter. She started with violin, played piano and percussion, then she wanted to switch to the trumpet, and then wanted to drop it altogether. I remember saying, ""We don't drop our instruments in this family. Everyone takes an instrument until they graduate, and that's what we do as a family, so you've got to figure out if it's violin or trumpet or something else. And I don't ever want to hear the music teacher telling me you're not showing up again."" And that's when I knew, I am the same parent, I have heard this before. CNN: How would each of you describe that relationship between mother and daughter? Vanessa: I am lucky to have three daughters who are completely different. I look at my daughters and I have different relationships with all three and there are parts of each personality that are very special. I rely on them for their particular qualities, but I feel happy that I have three completely different opportunities to make my mommy-daughter relationship different. Helen: And mine was such trial and error before Vanessa was born. I had no skills in diaper changing or feeding or any of the things that you're required to do as a mother. I enjoyed having a girl -- the mother-daughter shopping, dressing up and doing those things together. There'll be difficult times, especially when girls start growing up, and it's not easy, but you get through it. You just have to be patient and give them their space and recognize who they are. CNN: Is there a moment between you two that stands out as unforgettable? Helen: For me, it was when Vanessa had performed ""Kiss of the Spider Woman"" on Broadway, because we knew that was one of the things that she wanted to do her entire life. Her high school picture said ""I'll see you on Broadway."" It was something that she'd worked very hard toward. She had some people that did not want her to be on Broadway, and she persisted. Vanessa: I think one of my mother-daughter memories was at the first state dinner that I attended, when President Reagan invited me to the White House that October as Miss America, and my mother said, ""Whatever you do, get the president to sign the menu!"" I ended up sitting at his table and trying to think, how am I going to get through this dinner with the president and get him to sign my menu? I listened to him talk about his life in Hollywood and towards the end, I said ""Can you please sign this menu for my mother? She will kill me otherwise."" And he very politely did it, and she still has it. The things that you do for your mother! Helen: But they're important things.","Vanessa Williams and her mother, Helen, have a new book out for Mother's Day .

"Paris (CNN) -- The father of missing Swiss twins sent a letter to his wife saying he had killed them before committing suicide, police said Friday. Matthias Schepp, 43, also studied suicide techniques, poisons and ferry schedules before allegedly taking 6 year-old Alessia and Livia Schepp from their home St. Sulpice, near Lausanne in western Switzerland, on January 30, according to police in the Swiss canton of Vaud. The girls were spotted on a ferry to the island of Corsica the next day, but there have been no confirmed sightings since, according to investigators. A bar owner in Cerignola in southeastern Italy reported seeing a man with a northern Italian accent taking his daughter to the restroom, according to Rai Uno TV, which added that a police review of the bar's video doesn't support claims the man was Schepp. Schepp killed himself by stepping in front of a train in Cerignola on February 3, a spokesman for the Swiss police said this week. Authorities did not release the contents of the letters, but the Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera published a sentence it said was from Schepp's last letter, dated the same day he committed suicide and mailed from Bari, which is also in southern Italy about 60 miles (100 kilometers) east of where his body was found. ""The children rest in peace, they have not suffered,"" the newspaper quoted the letter as saying. It is possible that Schepp killed the girls on the ferry to Corsica and threw their bodies overboard, Jacques Dallest, a French prosecutor, said earlier this week. In addition to the alleged confession, the letters -- eight in all -- contained about 4,500 euros, police said. Two more letters, containing 1,500 euros, were found in a postal box that was no longer in service. Police learned of the letters on February 8, but did not tell the public to avoid complicating the search for the girls, according to a police statement. In addition to the letters, police said searches of Schepp's computer revealed that he looked up information about firearms two days before allegedly taking the girls. The next day, he searched for information about poisoning techniques and ferry timetables, according to a statement on the website of the Vaud Cantonal Police. ""The information shows that the father had planned the trip in detail,"" according to the police statement. Valerio Lucidi, the twins' uncle, said in an interview with Rai Uno TV that ""the fact that everything has been planned for days is really worrying."" Swiss police searched the St. Sulpice home three times and investigated 60 other homes in the neighborhood, Vaud police said. They also searched the father's four boats at the ports of Morges and Vidy as well as other ports in the region. Police have contacted all service stations between St. Sulpice and the Swiss city of Geneva, monitored all customs posts in the Geneva region, and hired a helicopter to search the lake near St. Sulpice. Police are now searching for the girls in Corsica, while the investigation in Switzerland is examining the family situation and the father's private and professional life. Police have said Schepp took the girls following family problems, but police said they aren't aware of any evidence suggesting Schepp was having an affair. CNN's Saskya Vandoorne in Paris contributed to this report.","Newspaper quoted letter as saying the twins ""have not suffered""

"Dhaka, Bangladesh (CNN) -- Rescuers searched frantically for survivors after a packed ferry carrying at least 250 people capsized in southern Bangladesh, killing at least 32 people, police said Tuesday. The MV Shariatpur-1 sank in the Meghna River after colliding with a cargo ferry early Tuesday while passengers slept, a survivor said. ""We were seven in a cabin in the ferry, and six of my family members are still missing,"" Mohammad Dulal Dewan told CNN. ""Everything happened before I could understand anything."" The 55-year-old survivor said he ""jumped into the river and was rescued by people in another passing ferry."" Dewan and his family were traveling to Dhaka, Bangladesh's capital, to see his brother-in-law off to the United States. Shamim Fakir was scheduled to fly on his U.S. trip early Wednesday, Dewan said. He was still missing Tuesday evening. Mohammad Azizul Alam, the administrative chief of Munshiganj district, said officials had received a list of 61 missing people from families and the death toll might increase. ""We believe many bodies are still trapped inside the sunken ferry, and the rescue operation is still on,"" Shahabuddin Khan, police chief of Munshiganj, told CNN. Khan said divers from the Bangladesh navy and the Fire Service and Civil Defence took part in the operation in addition to police and the Bangladesh Inland Water Transport Authority. The water authority's chairman, Khandker Shamsuddoha Khandaker, told reporters the ferry had been traced 70 feet (more than 20 meters) under water. About 30 people were initially rescued after the ferry collided with the cargo boat on the river in Munshiganj district, about 25 miles (40 kilometers) south of Dhaka. The ferry was traveling to the nation's capital from Shariatpur district. Ferry accidents are common on Bangladesh's vast river network.

"(CNN) -- The bodies of two dolphins and the head of another have washed up along the Gulf Coast, raising red flags for federal investigators already looking into roughly half a dozen dolphin killings. Excluding the latest three, the bodies of at least seven dolphins have turned up this year along a 120-mile stretch of the Gulf Coast from Louisiana to Florida. Some were shot, stabbed and mutilated. It's unclear whether the latest three deaths are related to those killings, but investigators are exploring that possibility. Moby Solangi, lead biologist of The Institute of Marine Mammal Studies in Gulfport, Mississippi, performed necropsies on nine of the dead marine mammals and will do the 10th on Wednesday. ""We have submitted those results to the federal enforcement officers, who are going to do additional exams or testing to further clarify the cause of death,"" he said. Citing the ongoing criminal investigation, Solangi declined to elaborate on the results. The Marine Mammal Protection Act states that anyone convicted of killing a dolphin could be sentenced to one year in prison and fined up to $100,000. The law also makes it a crime to feed dolphins in the wild. The remains of the latest three dolphins were found in Mississippi. A group of bird surveyors discovered an adult dolphin head on the west tip of Horn Island on Friday. On Saturday, someone found the body of a 1-year-old male dolphin on the beach in Gulfport. On Tuesday, another dolphin was found dead in Bay St. Louis; a teacher at a boarding school saw the animal and reported it. It's not unusual to see dolphin bodies, or even parts of bodies, wash up. What is unusual is evidence of human interaction as the cause of death, as appeared to be the case in the first seven situations. The first dolphin was found January 8 with a bullet wound on Deer Island, near Biloxi, Mississippi. In June, a bottlenose dolphin was found in Perdido Bay, Florida, near the Florida-Alabama state line, with a screwdriver stuck in its head. In September, one was found on Elmers Island, Louisiana, with a gunshot wound. On October 10, a dolphin was found on the beach in Dauphin Island, Alabama, with its fluke cut off. The list continues. On November 6, a dolphin was found dead with numerous cuts near Ocean Springs, Mississippi. Three days later, two more were discovered: another one with bullet wounds near Ocean Springs, and one on Ship Island, a remote barrier island off Biloxi, Mississippi, with its jaw cut off. Authorities are still trying to determine whether a dead dolphin found November 2, in Bayou Julia, Louisiana, is linked to the other killings. Jeff Radonski, a deputy special agent for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, which is leading the investigation, spoke last month about the deaths. ""We need to have witnesses come forward. We need public input and information,"" he said.","Two bodies and the head of another dolphin are found in Mississippi .

"(CNN)  -- The name Kuti belongs to a musical dynasty. But Femi Kuti is by no means living in his father's shadow and is much more than just the son of Afrobeat legend Fela Kuti. For 26 years, Femi has been making his own music. He has crossed over to a global audience, recording with the likes of Mos Def and Macy Gray, and even providing a cameo voice over in video game Grand Theft Auto IV. But his career has not been about ignoring his past, but building on his father's legacy. ""I just wanted my own music so I was not really running away from that fact or trying to find my own identity as such,"" Kuti said. ""I just wanted to play good music and be happy playing good music."" His father, Nigerian multi-instrumentalist Fela, was an international superstar and is credited with inventing the Afrobeat genre. However, it wasn't just his music that made Fela famous but his views as well. He preached for democracy over dictatorship and his music gave a voice to millions in Nigeria who were powerless in politics. ""He was truthful, he stood his ground, he never compromised, even at the risk of his life, and I think that's really what people admire,"" Kuti explained. ""He never for one second thought of compromising or selling out his ideas. ""I saw him many times stand in front of the soldiers and say 'shoot me, kill me' and we all feared for his life many times, and I thought 'wow, will I ever be this brave in my life?' So I admired him,"" he continued. But Fela's son has become a star in his own right. At 48, Femi has already spent a lifetime in music and grew up playing in his father's band. In 1985 he assembled his own band called ""The Positive Force"" and through it he discovered his own style and his own voice. But he says watching his father stand up for himself gave him the strength to never compromise.  ""I've witnessed a lot in my life, in his life, and I think all this is part of what gives me the courage myself to stand firm,"" he said. Like his father's, Femi's voice is political, his cause is human rights. He says that a political message in his music is more important than singing about love. Inside Africa: Maurice Kirya - Ugandan soul music . ""I couldn't see myself possibly doing anything else -- when I see poverty so blatant in front of me I don't see myself, I don't see the love story that could overwhelm my mind than singing about deprived people or children for instance,"" he said. ""I see that in a country so rich as Nigeria people can't afford a good education, we still have no electricity, the politicians keep giving us all their excuses,"" he added. ""We're 12 years now in a new democratic era and we're still fighting the same story that my father fought when I was 15."" In his latest work Femi has not turned his back on his father's Afrobeat style; he's redefined, it adding worldwide influence into the music. He recorded new album ""Africa for Africa"" in the same studio where he produced his first recordings with his father. The comparisons with Fela remain and the message is the same as it's always been. The recording itself has no superfluous production on it; Femi says he wanted this one to sound raw by making this the least produced album he's ever made. ""We thought nobody will like the album and then immediately from Europe everyone was like 'oh this is real raw, oh we love it,'"" he said. ""We all got excited so that gave me the extra energy to want to play it on stage and continue -- I think there is nothing more terrible than you walk out and nobody likes it. You are so depressed -- it's like being sick and you cannot find what is wrong with you"" he continued. But his live shows are always acclaimed. On stage, it's easy to see Femi Kuti's connection to his craft. But after so many years of performing, he says it's the chance to make people smile, feel happy and be inspired that still drives him today. ""You might play to 5,000 people and one person might come up and tell you 'wow, thank you for a wonderful night,' and you go to bed and it rings in your head,"" he explained. He says that most importantly, when people think about his music he doesn't want them to think about him. ""I want them to think about what I'm saying -- the importance of Africa, the future of Africa,"" he said. ""I don't want them to think about Femi and Fela Kuti. It's beyond me, it wasn't about my father, it was about the African people -- it was about a greater place to be.""","Femi Kuti has been making music for 26 years .

"(CNN) -- Leading Turkey in a political partnership with Recep Tayyip Erdogan, the country's prime minister, would be ""very good."" That's the view of his biggest rival in this weekend's presidential elections, Ekmeleddin Ihsanoglu. The comment might seem unusual for a politician, but it reflects Turkey's admiration for Erdogan. Ihsanoglu, speaking on Turkish television, continued in the same vein, noting he liked Erdogan's leadership and admired his work as prime minister. According to the polls, more than half of Turkey agrees. Erdogan has won a record three terms as prime minister and polls show he's likely to win Sunday's presidential elections. This is because Erdogan has led the country with actions, not words. Erdogan has always been known by what he has achieved. His oratory is impressive, but it's not his winning point. Before Erdogan was elected mayor of Istanbul in 1994, there were frequent water cuts, garbage piled through the streets and air pollution. He solved the problems in just three years. Erdogan then co-established his own party, the Justice and Development Party, or AKP, and ran in the general elections. He was known colloquially as the saver of Istanbul and in 2002, he was voted in as prime minister, with 34% of the vote. At the time Turkey was facing its biggest economic crisis. Inflation rate ran above 30% and overnight interest rates had hit 63%. Under Erdogan, inflation declined to single digits and GDP tripled. His commitment to doing business with emerging markets such as Russia and China meant the country secured nearly $130 billion in foreign investment, compared to $15 billion during the previous 80 years. Visitor numbers soared, from 16 million in 2003 to 35 million in 2013. The economic upturn helped Turkey fund schools, hospitals, highways, railways, airways and universities. And, looking at the figures, it seems naive to question how Erdogan continues to dominate Turkish politics. The recipe is simple: He is beneficial for the people, and they want him as their leader. Further, when compared to the AKP, the opposition party CHP looks incompetent. But Erdorgan's success is not just economic. Turkey has a long way to go towards full democracy, but Erdogan has tackled three significant problems. Firstly he has, for example, allowed the army to do its one and only job: Be an army. Secondly, he has backed the ""solution process,"" designed to bring peace with the Kurdish region. The ""Kurdish Problem"" has cost more than 30,000 lives and up to $450 billion. Thirdly, Erdogan has also modernized Turkish society by lifting the headscarf ban in universities and public, liberating religious women. Erdogan, in a first for the country, also expressed condolences to the Armenian people for the massacre in 1915, during WWI. Further, he initiated reforms that empowered non-Muslim communities, such as the 2008 Law on Foundations that enabled property worth $2.5 billion, previously occupied unjustly by the state, to be returned to minorities. It won't be a surprise if Erdogan is elected as president. Under his leadership, democratic and economic improvements will continue. It is good now -- and it will hopefully get better.

"(CNN) -- It was not what tennis star Andy Murray needed to hear on the eve of his Wimbledon title defense. Having hired as his new coach former women's No. 1 Amelie Mauresmo, herself a winner on the hallowed grass courts, the Scot was looking forward to his usual home support over the next two weeks. Instead, he has been forced to defend the Frenchwoman from criticism by British tennis legend Virginia Wade. Before Murray's success last year, Wade was the last Briton to win a Wimbledon singles title when she triumphed at the All England Club in 1976. But in an interview with the UK Press Association Saturday, she said she thought his appointment of a female coach was ""a joke"" upon first hearing the news. ""She's done it a few times before with me. It doesn't surprise me,"" Murray told reporters Sunday. Wade had previously criticized Murray for acting like ""a drama queen"" during a French Open match in 2012 as he struggled with a back injury. ""The reason for working with Amelie was about finding the right personality with the right experience to help me,"" Murray continued. ""I think she will help me. I've really enjoyed the last 10 days I spent on the court with her. It's been great. ""And if it helps bring more female coaches into men's sport -- and women's sport -- that's a good thing. Because there's absolutely no reason why someone like Amelie can't help me."" Mauresmo won the women's singles title at Wimbledon in 2006 and coached last year's winner Marion Bartoli to an unlikely success, though Wade described the 34-year-old as having been ""a little fragile mentally"" during her career. Murray, nonetheless, will be looking to capitalize on Mauresmo's expertise as he heads out on Centre Court Monday to start his title defense against David Goffin of Belgium. The 27-year-old has struggled for form in 2014 after undergoing surgery on a back injury nine months ago. He has failed to win a single match against a top-10 opponent all year but will take confidence from his run to the French Open semifinals. With Mauresmo on-board he hopes to become the first Brit to defend a Wimbledon crown since the great Fred Perry achieved the feat in 1936. Their partnership did not have the most positive start, with Murray losing the second match of his title defense at Queen's Club last week. Despite the weight of history on his shoulders, Murray is keen to make the most of the experience. ""I think tomorrow, I need to enjoy that moment when I walk back on the court,"" he said. ""But as soon as I start playing the match, it's about trying to win. And I enjoy winning. I don't really want to go out on the court tomorrow and enjoy playing and then lose. ""It's time when I get on the court to start concentrating. Not think about last year, concentrate on this year's tournament and that's it."" ""I know there's going to be pressure. That's why today when I woke up there's butterflies there. You're one day away from starting the tournament. ""But I hope that I'm able to deal with it well. We'll find out tomorrow."" Elsewhere on Wimbledon's opening day, top seed Novak Djokovic takes on Andrey Golubev of Kazakhstan while 2010 finalist Tomas Berdych faces Victor Hanescu of Romania. In the women's draw, No. 2 seed Li Na of China will look to improve on her first-round exit at the French Open when she takes on Paula Kania of Poland.

"(CNN) -- Surprise! Jodie Foster's now a married woman. The actress and filmmaker quietly tied the knot with her girlfriend Alexandra Hedison over the weekend, a rep for Foster confirmed to CNN. According to E! Online, which first reported the news, Foster and Hedison had been dating for almost a year. The entertainment site took note of the relationship last September after photos surfaced of Foster spending time with Hedison, a photographer/actress and an ex-girlfriend of Ellen DeGeneres. No other details are yet available about Hedison and Foster's nuptials, although we won't hold our breath: Foster is notoriously private about her personal life. At the 2013 Golden Globes, she declined to give a ""big coming out speech"" as she accepted her Cecil B. DeMille award, saying that she'd already come out to those close to her. ""I already did my coming out about a thousand years ago, back in the stone age,"" Foster said. ""If you had been a public figure from the time that you were a toddler, if you had to fight for a life that felt real and honest and normal against all odds, then maybe then you too might value privacy above all else."" In that speech, Foster expressed gratitude to her former partner Cydney Bernard, with whom she has two sons. CNN's Jane Caffrey contributed to this report.","Jodie Foster quietly married her girlfriend over the weekend .

"(CNN) -- They used to say there wasn't any law in Texas west of the Pecos. But there was; it just came out of the end of someone's gun. And apparently that still works as a legal construct in our courts. A San Antonio man was just acquitted of murder even though he admitted to shooting a woman during a dispute over paid sex. Ezekiel Gilbert said he shot Ivie Frago in the neck when she refused to return the $150 he gave her for sex. She was paralyzed and died seven months later at 23. Frago had made the dreaded mistake of not understanding Texas has laws on the books that are much more frightful than Florida's ""Stand Your Ground"" statutes. The use of deadly force is apparently justified ""in the night"" when someone attempts to leave with your valuable or tangible property. Frago instantly became a thief under Texas law when she refused to have sex or return the money, even though prostitution is also a crime. Gilbert, sadly, was transformed by circumstance into a legalized executioner of a young woman who would've probably been out on bail an hour after being arrested for stealing the money. Gilbert says he is suffering, too, though, and now has to ""change the channel"" when he sees TV shows ""about people using guns."" Gilbert broke down in tears when he heard the verdict and that might be because he knows he lives in a state where the rest of the nation thinks we have an express lane to get killers to death row. Texas is, usually, unduly hard on criminals. A few days before Gilbert was set free, a Waco man got 50 years in prison for stealing a rack of ribs. Willie Smith, 43, had previous convictions for theft, cocaine possession and assault. The grocery store employee said Smith told him he was carrying a knife in his pocket when he stole the ribs. Because of that, he was classified under the law as a robber, which escalated the crime to a more severe category. Don't get hungry with a knife in your pocket if you live in Texas, even though that $35 rack of ribs will cost Texas taxpayers hundreds of thousands of dollars to feed and incarcerate Smith until he is eligible for parole in about 15 years. Those of us who live here often can't make sense of our state, either. Maybe our love of Texas is a kind of curse. We often feel like we have fallen for someone perfect who has since gone crazy. In one of the world's largest economies, driving development in technology, agriculture and energy and developing a culture that has given to history eternal art and literature, we also are the most abundant source of America's clowns and political hypocrites. And they even proliferate during a drought while other crops are dying. I'd like to believe there's a form of Texas Tourette syndrome that causes our governmental institutions and some individuals to emit the unspeakable, or take actions that are disconnected from accepted norms of, well, at least the late 20th century. As discomforting as that lay diagnosis might be, none of us wants to believe headlines like the one about the travesty of Gilbert's acquittal reflect the beliefs of Texas and its people. But we can no longer be certain. Some of our crazies we are proud of because they have national entertainment value. Our Republican Rep. Louie Gohmert sees a bright clear line running from gay marriage and bestiality to any attempts at gun control. If you don't understand that limiting to 10 the number of bullets in a gun's magazine is a consequence of allowing people of the same sex to be married, you might not live in Gohmert's district. We are also the state that sent Ted Cruz to the U.S. Senate even as he touted a deep belief in a conspiracy between President Barack Obama and the United Nations to rid America of golf courses and paved roads. Ignorance is often no obstacle to success in Texas. In fact, it might be an advantage. Edith Jones, who sits as a justice on the Fifth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans, a jurisdiction that includes her home state of Texas, is a Ronald Reagan appointee who allegedly argued in a February lecture at the University of Pennsylvania that blacks and Hispanics are more likely to commit violent crimes. According to a judicial misconduct complaint filed by civil rights groups and others, she insisted blacks and Hispanics outnumber Anglos on death row because ""these racial groups are involved in more violent crime."" Though it would not have affected her insights, Judge and Jury Jones was speaking before the release of a new study of federal crime data by the ACLU that shows blacks, in particular, are arrested at a national rate almost four times that of whites, even for minor crimes such as marijuana use. ""Her honor"" also allegedly insisted that it was a disservice to outlaw the death penalty for the mentally retarded, and that ""most Mexican nationals would rather be on death row in the U.S. than in a Mexican prison."" Although her cultural sensitivity courses were probably not completed, Jones is a graduate of the University of Texas Law School, which more than 25 years ago launched a national civil rights symposium to honor Heman Sweatt, an African-American who won a landmark case in 1950 to integrate the law school at the University of Texas. A part of the campus now bears his name. Many civil rights groups, meanwhile, have filed affidavits seeking Jones' removal from the federal bench. A lot of Texans would like to start a similar process to dump our governor. But the odds of success aren't great. We have elected Rick Perry three times, regardless of his political behavior. He appoints creationists to the state school board to put his religion in textbooks, calls evolution a theory and he even tried to make same-sex marriage a felony. But Perry may have sinned against his own party when he vetoed a ""Buy American"" bill that was approved overwhelmingly by a Republican-dominated legislature. There are many multinational corporations that are, in fact, ""buying American"" when they make their large donations to Perry's quivering national political aspirations, which might explain the veto pen. I was going to tell you about our attorney general who said that registering Democrats to vote in Texas was ""moreÂ dangerous than what the leader of North Korea threatened when he said he was going to add Austin as one of the recipients of his nuclear weapons."" I also wanted to mention the tea party activist who was recorded claiming, ""Republicans in Texas don't want blacks to vote."" But I'm trying to retain a little bit of pride here, and, anyway, there just isn't enough space to get it all told. In Texas, even our crazy is big.

"Jakarta, Indonesia (CNN) -- Hours after voting ended in Indonesia's presidential race, candidate Joko ""Jokowi"" Widodo proclaimed victory while his rival Prabowo Subianto urged patience as the official vote count proceeded. Results of an unofficial quick count on Wednesday indicated a slight edge for Widodo, a former furniture exporter who rose to become Jakarta governor, ahead of Prabowo, a former military man. ""Today, Indonesia's new son has been chosen by the people,"" Widodo declared. ""We begin a new phase in our history and we start a new beginning of Indonesia."" Widodo's leap from relative obscurity to potential leader of the world's most populous Muslim nation has drawn comparisons to U.S. President Barack Obama's meteoric rise in 2008. For his supporters, the ""Jokowi effect"" heralds a new breed of political leaders -- a break from Indonesia's tradition of leaders with military, bureaucratic or elite backgrounds. ""It's not a victory for the party, not a victory for the team but this is a victory for all Indonesian people,"" Widodo told his supporters, dressed in his trademark checkered shirt. Independent pollsters indicated about 52-53% of votes for Widodo and 46-48% for Prabowo. These unofficial quick counts, drawn from samples from polling stations, have usually been accurate to within a 1-2% margin of error. But unlike previous Indonesian elections, this presidential race is a tight one. ""By most standards of democracies that we know, a vote spread of five to six percentage points would be seen as decisive. In the Indonesian context, this is pretty close,"" said Thomas Pepinsky, associate professor at Cornell University, who has an interest in South Asia. On Wednesday night, Prabowo suggested he wasn't fazed by the quick count results. ""Let's allow KPU (Indonesia's election commission) to work and decide the victory,"" the candidate told his supporters. ""Despite the results we received from a number of quick count(s)... the real count says that we are higher than our competitor."" Prabowo, a former son-in-law of Indonesian president Suharto, has sought to project an image as a take-charge leader. Having never served in public office, the former lieutenant general has campaigned hard on his military service. ""We will be patient, be polite,"" he told supporters. ""But don't ever think that we are weak. Don't ever think that we can easily be intimidated."" Millions of Indonesian voters cast their paper ballots Wednesday. These ballots will be counted at a local district level, then recounted at national level. The entire process is expected to take two to three weeks. Widodo told his supporters in Jakarta, ""Our job is to guard and ensure that the count by the election commission is conducted in a proper, honest, clean way, free of any manipulation."" The next president will be inaugurated on October 20. Indonesian voters have grappled with concerns over a sluggish economic growth, increasing violence against religious minorities and government corruption. The next president needs to ""make a strong push to rein in corruption that plagues Indonesia's economy and make it a suitable place for domestic and international investments,"" said Pepinsky. CNN's Kathy Quiano reported from Jakarta and Madison Park reported and wrote from Hong Kong. CNN's David Molko contributed to this report from Jakarta.","Unofficial quick counts show slight edge for ""Jokowi"" Widodo over Prabowo Subianto .

"(CNN) -- Six males potentially exposed to radioactive material stashed inside a stolen truck were examined at a Mexico hospital on Friday, a day after authorities said they'd recovered all of the potentially deadly substance. All six tested at Pachuca General Hospital were negative for radiation poisoning, Hidalgo state health official Jose Antonio Copca said. They were released around 6:10 p.m. (7:10 p.m. ET), the state's health agency said in a statement. After their release, the six were to be interrogated by authorities to determine if they were involved in the theft of cobalt-60, said Jose Luis Manjarrez, a spokesman for Mexico's Attorney General's office. The six live near where the dangerous material had been, though Copca said only one showed symptoms such as nausea and headaches consistent with radiation poisoning. They were taken to Pachuca General, in the state capital of Hidalgo, by federal police officers, according to the state health agency. Earlier Friday, the state-run Notimex news agency quoted Copca as saying the six -- ages 16, 22, 24, 25, 37 and 38 -- had apparently come into contact with or otherwise been in the vicinity of cobalt-60 about 12 hours after the truck containing it was stolen Monday in Tepojaco. News of the hospitalizations first surfaced on Twitter. That came after Mexican authorities announced they recovered all the radioactive material. But officials haven't said yet if those responsible for taking it have been caught or even identified. The missing vehicle, along with most of the missing radioactive element used for medical purposes, was located in a remote area in Hueypoxtla about 40 kilometers (25 miles) from where it was taken. All of the radioactive material was accounted for in that same area early Thursday evening. Mexican authorities told the International Atomic Energy Agency that the truck, which was transporting the material from a hospital in Tijuana to a radioactive waste storage center, was stolen Monday. Tepojaco is located some 55 kilometers north of Mexico City and 48 kilometers from Pachuca. The container holding the cobalt-60 was found about a kilometer (half a mile) from the truck and had been opened, said Juan Eibenschutz Hartman, head of Mexico's National Commission for Nuclear Security and Safeguards. There was less than 40 grams (1.4 ounces) of the hazardous material inside the capsule. The Hidalgo health agency said Friday that residents of Hueypoxtla and surrounding areas don't face any significant health risks due to the material, assuming they didn't contact it directly. Where are the thieves? Authorities -- who have said they expect that the thieves will turn up to get medical treatment for possible radiation exposure -- have not announced explicitly that anyone has been caught. But the Notimex article detailing the hospitalizations did state that a 25-year-old man and a 16-year-old boy are in federal police custody. The report did not say why they'd been detained, only that the Interior Ministry will soon have more details. Nor was there an indication whether the two were among those hospitalized in Pachuca, the capital of Hidalgo state. The attorney general office's organized crime division is investigating the case, according to Manjarrez. He added that the driver of the stolen truck continues to cooperate with authorities. Cleanup . Authorities are guarding the area and have set up a 500-meter (550-yard) perimeter around it near the city of Hueypoxtla, Eibenschutz said. They are evaluating whether any residents were exposed, but none has tested positive for radiation, according to the civil protection office. Cleaning up the area could take weeks, he said, because they don't have robotic equipment they would need to quickly collect the dangerous cobalt. They're coming up with a plan and considering asking for help from the International Atomic Energy Agency, the United States or Canada. An early theory is that the thieves were unaware of what exactly they had taken. ""At the time the truck was stolen, the source was properly shielded,"" the IAEA said. ""However, the source could be extremely dangerous to a person if removed from the shielding, or if it was damaged."" But Eibenschutz said the truck wasn't properly set up to transport the radioactive material, since it didn't have a GPS for tracking or other necessary equipment. Uses for cobalt-60 . Cobalt-60 is used in radiotherapy and in industrial tools such as leveling devices and thickness gauges. Large sources of cobalt-60 are used to sterilize certain foods, as the gamma rays kill bacteria but don't damage the product, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. If released into the environment, the radioactive material can harm people. And experts consider cobalt-60 one of the ""candidates"" for making dirty bombs. Bombs made with cobalt-60 ""pose a threat mainly because even a fraction of a gram emits a huge number of high-energy gamma rays; such material is harmful whether outside or inside the body,"" according to a 2011 report by the Congressional Research Service. In a speech last year, the IAEA director warned that such a dirty bomb ""detonated in a major city could cause mass panic, as well as serious economic and environmental consequences."" Preliminary information suggests that the thieves did not know what the truck's cargo was when they stole it, said Jaime Aguirre Gomez, deputy director of radiological security at the National Commission for Nuclear Security and Safeguards. The shielding that protects the cobalt-60 is designed so that the radioactive source is difficult to extract, Aguirre said. The casing is designed not to be opened or perforated easily. The theft . The truck and its cargo went missing early Monday after the driver of the white 2007 Volkswagen truck and an assistant had stopped to rest at a gas station, local prosecutor Marcos Morales said. About 1 a.m. Monday, a man armed with a handgun knocked on the passenger window. When the passenger rolled down his window, the gunman demanded the keys to the vehicle, Morales said. Both the driver and his assistant were taken to an empty lot where they were bound and told not to move. They heard one of the assailants use a walkie-talkie type device or phone to tell someone, ""It's done,"" Morales said. Mexico alerted the IAEA to the theft, following international protocol, Aguirre said. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security is assisting with the investigation into the stolen truck, Mexican authorities said. The U.S. government has sensors at border crossings and sea ports to prevent radioactive materials from entering the country. This includes large stationary sensors designed to scan vehicles going through land border crossings as well as pager-size devices carried by agents. Some of this equipment is sensitive enough that it has been set off by people who had recently undergone radiation therapy, according to a U.S. law-enforcement source. According to the Congressional Research Service report, in Thailand in 2000, a disused cobalt-60 source was stored outdoors and bought by two scrap collectors, who took it to a junkyard where it was cut open. Some workers suffered burn-like injuries, and eventually three people died and seven others suffered radiation injuries, the report says. Nearly 2,000 others who lived nearby were exposed to radiation. CNN's Ed Payne, Esprit Smith and Catherine E. Shoichet contributed to this report.","NEW: The males tested at hospital ranged in age from 16 to 38 .

"(CNN) -- Ultimately, it's about power. When Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovich suspended an agreement with the European Union (EU) on November 21, his personal considerations would certainly have been a driving factor. Signing the agreement would not only have brought Ukraine much closer to its Western neighbors. It would also have made its political sphere more democratic and competitive and its economy more transparent -- outcomes that would have been unlikely to fit with Yanukovich's personal interests. Read more: Russia calls for stability and order . What the EU did in the past with its enlargement policy, and what it is trying now to replicate with its ""Eastern Partnership"", is to use its economic power as a tool to push neighboring countries towards liberal democracy. The more these countries -- among them Ukraine, Moldova, and Georgia -- move towards rule of law, democracy and a market economy, the more access they have to the EU market, and the easier it is for their people to travel and work in the EU. But the project to transform Ukraine's political and economic structures is unlikely to please Yanukovich. Allegations that his party had rigged voting in 2004 triggered the ""Orange Revolution,"" forcing him from office and giving power to his political opponents, including Yulia Tymoshenko, who became prime minister. Soon after Yanukovich was elected president in 2010, Tymoshenko was jailed after being found guilty of abuse of office, in a case many believe was politically motivated. In its negotiations, the EU had been demanding that Yanukovich free Tymoshenko. Ukraine is seen as a deeply corrupt country, ranked number 144 out of 177 countries in the Transparency International Corruption Perceptions Index. This environment provides a breeding ground for arbitrary rule by powerful clans. A rapprochement with the EU would, at least on longer term, put pressure on that rule. Another reason to put the agreement with the EU on hold seems to have been the Russia factor. Read more: Opinion -- why Ukraine's future lies with the EU . Russian President Vladimir Putin wants to bring the Ukraine into his sphere of influence through integration into a Moscow-led customs union which in the future shall be transformed into a fully-fledged ""Eurasian Union."" In the past few months, the Kremlin has put considerable pressure on Ukraine to move over to this camp. But for Yanukovich, an alliance with Russia would be a double-edged sword. While Putin is likely to give the Ukrainian leader a free hand to consolidate his power base, he would also want control over key economic and political decisions. In a close alliance, Ukraine would lose core elements of sovereignty. If Yanukovich were to hand his country over to Moscow, he would very likely be met with another revolution. Since the Orange Revolution in 2004, Ukraine's political class has been aware that it needs to stay in tune with popular opinion. And a clear majority wants to go West. People see a prosperous, well-governed EU next to their borders -- in sharp contrast with their own economic and political misery. That's why they are on the streets now, in Kiev and elsewhere. Yanukovich, however, is likely to try to keep Ukraine in the middle -- going neither West nor East. He wants to keep the status quo, where he feels safe. But the economic crisis is getting worse, and he needs help. Without a rapprochement, neither the EU nor Russia will invest substantially in his regime. Read more: Opinion -- beware Russia's power play . And there is a new factor which may bring additional dynamism into the game. Germany, now seen by many as the leading power in Europe, has recently put its weight behind the Eastern Partnership -- which had mainly been driven by Poland and Sweden in the past. In a speech on November 18, German Chancellor Angela Merkel flatly rejected Russia's claims over the region. Eastern European countries, she said, ""must decide themselves on their future direction."" ""Third parties"" -- ie Russia -- ""cannot have the right to veto,"" she said. Berlin would urge the EU to counter Russian pressure on Eastern Europe, ""be it in the form of additional sales opportunities for products from our partner countries, which for instance may not be exported to Russia, or in the form of assistance to diversify their energy supply,"" Merkel said. This is quite a turnaround in German policies towards Russia. It is the first time Merkel has spoken to Moscow with the assertive attitude of the leader of a great power. And she was doing what great powers usually do: pushing back other great powers and offering protection to smaller powers. In other words, Merkel took a first step towards a geopolitical competition with Russia over Eastern Europe -- effectively ending years of cozy bilateral relations with Moscow. Merkel has picked up the gauntlet thrown by Putin at her and the EU. But it is still unclear to what extent she will follow-up her rhetoric and push the EU towards making more substantial offers to Ukraine -- especially after the hopes of signing an agreement at the Vilnius summit have been disappointed. But she has shown a Germany that no longer afraid to confront Russia over Eastern Europe. This is starting to look like an entirely new game. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Ulrich Speck.","Thousands have been protesting in Kiev after the Ukrainian government rejected an EU deal .
The deal would have made Ukraine's political sphere more democratic, Ulrich Speck says .
But he says it was not in the president's own interests to sign and move away from Russia .
Germany has shown it is not afraid to confront Russia over Eastern Europe, Speck says ."
